  "<p>Russia's punitive campaign in the Caucasus threatened to intensify into all-out war against Georgia last night, with Russian troops seizing control of strategic towns a couple of hours from the capital, and aircraft pounding Georgian infrastructure.</p> <p>Vastly outnumbered by the Kremlin's ground and air forces, the Georgian government announced it was pulling back its troops to defend the capital, Tbilisi, against a feared Russian onslaught. Washington accused the Kremlin of long preparing an invasion of Georgia in \"aggression that must not go unanswered\".</p> <p>\"Russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people. Such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century,\" President George Bush said. \"The Russian government must reverse the course that it appears to be on.\" He urged Russia to agree to a ceasefire offer by Georgia.</p> <p>The Georgian authorities said the town of Gori, 40 miles north of Tbilisi, had, in effect, fallen to the Russians, who were also advancing from the breakaway province of Abkhazia in the west into territory previously under Georgian control.</p> <p>\"The Georgian army is retreating to defend the capital. The government is urgently seeking international intervention to prevent the fall of Georgia and further loss of life,\" said the Georgian government. Its president, Mikhail Saakashvili, said the Russian campaign was aimed at overthrowing his government.</p> <p>The Georgian embassy in London last night accused Russia of attempting to \"conquer\" Georgia. \"Today the statehood of Georgia is in great danger and thereby leaving existing world order in uncertainty.\"</p> <p>Giorgi Badridze, acting head of the embassy, compared Russia's actions with Nazi incursions into Europe in the run-up to the second world war.</p> <p>Alexander Lomaia of Georgia's National Security Council said: \"Russia seems intent on overthrowing the democratically elected government of Georgia and occupying the country.\"</p> <p>The Kremlin spurned a chorus of western calls for a ceasefire, already accepted by Saakashvili, and appeared determined to ram home its military advantage at the risk of sparking an international crisis. Moscow seemed intent on imposing humiliating truce terms on Georgia.</p> <p>Russian prime minister Vladimir Putin, taking a leading role in the crisis, attacked Washington for helping Georgia fly home troops from Iraq and said the west was mistaking the aggressors for victims. \"The cold war has long ended but the mentality of the cold war has stayed firmly in the minds of several US diplomats. It is a real shame,\" Putin said.</p> <p>France's president, Nicolas Sarkozy, is to try to mediate in Moscow today before meeting Saakashvili in the Georgian capital, while Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany is to meet Russia's president, Dmitri Medvedev, in Sochi, just outside Georgia on the Black Sea, on Friday.</p> <p>The US vice-president, Dick Cheney, said: \"Russian aggression must not go unanswered and its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the United States.\"</p> <p>Military officials in Moscow insisted yesterday that Russian forces would not move beyond the contested region of South Ossetia on Georgia's northern border with Russia. Sergei Ivanov, the deputy prime minister, insisted Russian \"peacekeepers\" were contained in South Ossetia and Abkhazia. The Russian defence ministry said: \"There are no Russian troops in Gori.\"</p> <p>But by last night sources in Moscow and Tbilisi and observers on the ground confirmed that Russian troops had advanced tens of miles into Georgian-held territory from Abkhazia.</p> <p>Russian troops and armoured vehicles were in control of a Georgian military base at Senaki, 25 miles beyond the Abkhaz boundary, UN military observers confirmed. The Russians had also seized Georgian police stations in Zugdidi after delivering an ultimatum to the Georgians to surrender their weapons near the Abkhaz frontlines. The towns of Kutaisi and Kurga were said to have been seized.</p> <p>Georgian officials claimed that Russian tanks seized Gori, smashing the Georgian lines in two places to take control of the town that straddles the road connecting the eastern and western parts of Georgia.</p> <p>Saba Tsitsikashvili, a local journalist in Gori, said Russian troops had occupied the main road on the edge of the city, but had not moved towards the centre. \"People are in panic. This road where the troops are is about 2km from the centre,\" she said.</p> <p>\"This is a full-scale invasion.\" said Irakli Batkuashvili, head of Georgia's military planning division. \"This is an occupation... Half of Georgia is under Russian control. Our aim now is to build up our troops and to create a defensive line in front of Tbilisi.\"</p>",
  "<p>Jessica Duchen is a novelist, biographer and classical music journalist. Her writings include biographies of composers Erich Wolfgang Korngold and Gabriel Faur\u00e9, and <a href=\"http://jessicamusic.blogspot.com/2006/10/literary-prizes.html\">a classical music blog</a>. She was born and lives in London. </p> <p>Hungarian Dances, her third novel, is published in paperback by Hodder &amp; Stoughton, priced \u00a37.99.</p> <p>\"It was music, especially my passion for the violin, that drew me to the issues surrounding the Roma. My trips to Hungary and now the recent events in Italy have left me profoundly perturbed by public attitudes to this community. It's fascinating that century after century, Gypsies are both the most romanticised people on earth and the most vilified: this is almost as much the case now as it was two centuries ago. Writers, of course, have been milking the situation for donkey's years. My second novel, Hungarian Dances, tells the story of a British-born violinist, Karina, whose discovery of hidden truths about her Hungarian family history and her formidable grandmother Mimi's Roma background challenges her own sense of identity.\"</p> <h2>1. Carmen in Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e's Carmen</h2> <p>Carmen, thanks to Bizet's opera, has become the most legendary Gypsy of the lot. M\u00e9rim\u00e9e, and Bizet after him, charted the downfall of Carmen's lover, Don Jos\u00e9, who relates his life story to a traveller in the novella: his passion has morphed him in stages from mother's boy to murderer. Proud, independent and self-willed, Carmen can drive men to distraction while caring little for the effects of her actions. Yet she's multi-layered and complex \u2013 hence the fascination. Is she a free woman ahead of her time, an evil, corrupting influence, the eternal outsider hoist on her own non-conformist petard, or the innocent victim of an obsessed psychopath? Take your pick.</p> <h2>2. Esmeralda in Victor Hugo's The Hunchback of Notre Dame</h2> <p>Esmeralda, her story set in Paris in 1482, is as archetypal as Carmen \u2013 maybe more so, as Hugo endows this Gypsy dancer with a nearly Christ-like quality. An orphaned girl of almost superhuman kindness and the sufferer of a desperate unrequited love, she's first glorified and later destroyed by the crowd that loves her dancing, but succumbs to hysteria when accusing her of witchcraft. She's victimised, humiliated by the man she loves, and finally killed when she chooses death in preference to a loveless marriage. Hugo's saga exemplifies the romantic fascination for Gypsies as exotic sex symbols on the one hand and hapless victims of superstition and prejudice on the other; and Quasimodo, helping Esmeralda to sanctuary in the cathedral, finds redemption through his compassion for her. </p> <h2>3. The Raggle-Taggle Gypsies in the traditional Scottish ballad</h2> <p>\"She's gone with the Raggle-Taggle Gypsies-oh\" goes the refrain of this popular folk song, which dates from around 1720: the young wife of an aristocrat abandons her luxurious home to find love in the arms of a \"yellow Gypsy\" under the open sky. In one of the ballad's numerous different versions, the girl is the lord's unmarried daughter; in another, the Gypsy's six brothers are hanged for abducting her. The song features both the romanticising of this exotic race and their supposedly untrammelled lives, and society's fear, loathing and cruelty. But like so many old songs, this one gets to the heart of the matter. Is the fear inspired by the strength of the attraction? Implicitly, yes.</p> <h2>4. Kizzy in Rumer Godden's The Diddakoi</h2> <p>Kizzy, the heroine of this heartbreaking children's book, lives with her grandmother in a wagon and loves her horse better than anything in the world. When her grandmother dies, little Kizzy is catapulted out of her familiar and somewhat idyllic existence and forced to face life among people who are determined to bully her for being a \"Diddakoi\". The cruelty of stronger children towards weaker ones makes this book a desperate emotional upset, and a powerful read at an early age. </p> <h2>5. Mr Rochester (in disguise) in Charlotte Bront\u00eb's Jane Eyre</h2> <p>Mr Rochester takes advantage of the much-caricatured superstition that Gypsies are clairvoyant, and with good reason: when he disguises himself as a Gypsy fortune-teller, it gives him the power over Jane and Blanche to see beyond the superficial niceties that the women present to his usual incarnation. Jane is terrified by the fortune-teller's aspect \u2013 afraid of \"her\" dark skin, and of something or someone different from herself. Simultaneously, of course, she's transfixed.</p> <h2>6. Emil in Louise Doughty's Fires in the Dark</h2> <p>There's nothing romanticised about Doughty's saga of a travelling Czech Roma kumpania in the first half of the 20th century. It's probably the most thorough and insightful English novel ever written about the reality, rather than the myth, of Roma life. Emil emerges from a host of powerful characters as the hero, stoical and resourceful: ultimately he survives the devastation of his family at Auschwitz. The horrors of the Roma Holocaust are brought home, and not before time. Meanwhile Jane Eyre might have been interested to learn that \"gadje\" superstition about clairvoyance was the one shred of power over the enemy open to the Roma while the nets of bureaucracy, and later genocide, tightened around them. </p> <h2>7. Jasper Petulengro in George Borrow's Lavengro</h2> <p>Subtitled The Scholar \u2013 the Gypsy \u2013 the Priest, Borrow's most famous book, dating from 1851, makes no bones about its raison d'etre. Borrow states in the preface that part of this is \"the exposure of humbug\", most of it associated with \"Popery\" in the form of the priest. Jasper Petulengro, the Gypsy at the opposite extreme, becomes the \"blood brother\" of the book's narrator and is by far the most appealing person in the cast: a character in touch with nature, life-force and human and humane perceptiveness. He returns in Borrow's Romany Rye. </p> <h2>8. Pepita in Vita Sackville-West's Pepita</h2> <p>Pepita \u2013 real name was Josefa \u2013 was Vita Sackville-West's grandmother. The book named after her, written in 1937, is Sackville-West's voyage of discovery into her bizarre background. At the outset, Pepita, the 19-year-old daughter of a Spanish Gypsy, is pulled into a theatre by her family, demanding dancing lessons for her; it's soon revealed that she was probably the illegitimate daughter of a diplomat. But Pepita's daughter, Victoria \u2013 Vita's mother, seemingly madder than the proverbial hatter \u2013 is central later and it's in the elusive figure of Pepita that Sackville-West seeks the longed-for tenderness which her mother lacked. </p> <h2>9. Roux in Joanne Harris's Chocolat</h2> <p>Roux, the Irish river-traveller, becomes Vianne's right-hand man in Joanne Harris's bittersweet tale of cocoa, healing and more exposure of religious humbug. Like Borrow in Lavengro, Harris sets the Gypsy and the Priest up as opposite poles; when the village community is goaded into burning Roux's boat, all the old prejudices burst into flame too. But the conquering of conceit by chocolate must be the most delicious revenge ever devised. Hollywood seems to have deemed the religious aspect of the story too dangerous to screen and pulled the book's teeth for the purpose.</p> <h2>10. Joe Boswell in DH Lawrence's The Virgin and the Gypsy</h2> <p>It's the last line of Lawrence's short story that gives the game away. Yvette, the spoilt heroine, develops a fascination for a terrifically sexy Gypsy who, when she asks him how many children he has, replies: \"Say, five.\" Eventually a flood that drowns her grandmother finds the Gypsy handily present to save Yvette's life. Fearing death from hypothermia, they undress, chilled by water and shock, then huddle together for warmth and fall asleep. When she awakens, he's gone. It is only when she receives a note signed \"Joe Boswell\" that she realises that he has a name. That line offers a final hope that this story, like the Gypsy himself, is possibly the opposite of its outward appearance.</p>",
  "<p>\"It's okay with me,\" Elliott Gould would say in 1973's The Long Goodbye, in his incarnation of Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe. </p> <p>It could be Gould's signature role, crystallising the sardonic yet bemused presence he brought to such other Altman pictures as M*A*S*H and California Split. In 1970, Time magazine put Gould on its cover, declaring him a \"Star for an Uptight Age\", and now BAMcin\u00e9matek \u2013 the repertory house at the Brooklyn Academy of Music \u2013 has borrowed the description for its current season of the actor's work from the 70s.</p> <p>Gould grew up in Bensonhurst, a few miles further south in Brooklyn, the son of Jewish immigrants. Speaking at a screening of Little Murders (1971) at the weekend, he described his trepidation at the start of his career, uncertain that someone like \"me, Elliott Goldstein\", could make it. \"It frightened me. I was always very \u2013 as we would say on West 9th St \u2013 ascared \u2013 ascared of being judged.\" As late as Bugsy (1991), he needed 15 takes to overcome his Brooklyn accent and enunciate the first \"n\" in \"incognito\". \"I hope you like it,\" Gould said by way of introducing Little Murders. \"I know that it's interesting. Then you can tell me what you think afterwards.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336475655\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/08/11/littlemurder460.jpg\" alt=\"Elliot Gould in Little Murder\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elliott Gould in Little Murders. Photo: Kobal</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kobal</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It's a curious pleasure, an increasingly surreal satire on urban alienation in contemporary New York. Alan Arkin's third feature as director, it was adapted by Jules Feiffer from his own play, in which Gould had starred off and, briefly, on Broadway. He played Alfred Chamberlain, a photographer and self-described apathist who takes pictures of shit and drifts into a relationship with can-do Patsy Newquist (Marcia Rodd) while, in the background, the city comes apart at the seams. </p> <p>This is a New York of brownouts, heavy-breathing phone calls, vandalised amenities and random shootings that escalate to absurd levels \u2013 \"this goddam city\", as Mr Newquist calls it, is an early view of NYC-as-dystopia, a sketch of Travis Bickle's Manhattan played for laughs.</p> <p>The film is also a showcase for some virtuoso set-piece monologues from the likes of Donald Sutherland as a highly irreverent wedding officiator (\"What nonsense,\" he says of the vows, \"what a shocking invasion of privacy\"), Arkin as a police lieutenant on the verge of a nervous breakdown and Gould himself, when Alfred describes a series of letters he wrote to the agent monitoring his mail at college. </p> <p>The star enjoyed the show. I happened to be sat a couple of seats to Gould's right, and he laughed throughout, including at his own performance. The sequences set in Patsy's family home with her parents and adolescent brother seemed to tickle him particularly. \"This was made in 1970,\" he murmured to his companion. \"It's really good, isn't it?\" </p> <p>After the film ended, Gould did ask the audience what they made of the feature. The first response was not too encouraging: a young man in the front row said that, although he was a fan of the actor's work, he \"despised\" the film's violence. Gould bridled at his lack of appreciation for Feiffer's satire. \"Well, you're an authority, you're taking notes,\" he snapped. \"I'm just an artist. But I respect your opinion. I felt that way when I saw The Dark Knight lately...\" Other audience members testified to how accurate or prescient they found the film's depiction of New York. Later, Gould insisted that \"Jules is making a point as to how callous we have become. And we will become more callous.\" </p> <p>Jean-Luc Godard had briefly been interested in directing the adaptation, perhaps drawn to its anhomie. \"He took me for a walk round the block,\" Gould recalled. \"It was 57th Street, Carnegie Hall. He said, 'If my wife and children ask me to tell them I love them, I tell them to go fuck themselves.' I said, 'That's very strong, Jean-Luc, but I don't think I'm there yet.'\" The eventual director, Arkin, apparently received an appreciative note about the film from Jean Renoir. Gould leaned towards the young man in the front row. \"You like his work?\" he drawled.</p> <p>When it came to his long monologue about the surveillance agent, Gould had a simple but effective preparatory method. \"I went out very privately and smoked a joint to keep focused. So my only problem, because it was just one shot, was my mouth got a little dry.\" He also went into more detail about his early professional anxieties and how he was \"ascared of being judged, like this gentleman here\". He turned again to the young man in the front row, this time sincere. \"It frightened me not to please you.\"</p> <p>Out in the lobby, at an informal drinks do, things were less serious. I found Gould reminiscing about his friendship with the older Groucho Marx. \"He used to let me shave him as he stood there, fully dressed, in his beret,\" he said. \"I once changed a light bulb for him. Stood on his bed to do it. He said, 'That's the best piece of acting I've ever seen you do.'\" Some performers might have taken umbrage. It was okay with Gould.</p>",
  "<p>There we were on Sunday, my boyfriend, his son and I, crowded on the sofa, eating off our laps like a slightly less jaundiced version of The Simpsons, as we watched British cyclist Nicole Cooke climb the gold medal podium in Beijing. The same rainstorm that had bedevilled Cooke and her rivals as they sped around the 126km road race continued to beat down as she stood there, arms aloft, smile splitting her face, while the British national anthem rang out. She looked exhilarated, ecstatic, entrancing.</p> <p>\"Well,\" I said, taking a bite and leaving a significant pause before putting on my best Patricia Routledge impression, \"she could at least have brushed her hair.\"</p> <p>\"What!\" spluttered my 14-year-old stepson, \"She just completed a 78.5-mile road race, I don't think ...\"</p> <p>\"I was joking,\" I said, shaking my knife and fork at him. \"Joking!\"</p> <p>\"Oh,\" he said.</p> <p>And I was. Not a good joke, hands up. But the reason I'd made the comment was because of its incongruity, its obvious sarcasm - the notion that Cooke should have been thinking about anything except her triumph at that moment was patently ridiculous; the notion that she might be thinking about her looks was faintly offensive (and therein often lies the best comedy, although clearly not in this case). Here was a woman who had just battled against the best in the world, who had raced in quite awe-inspiringly nasty conditions - as she said later, they still had two hours to go when the torrential rain began - who had seemed to slip back in the very last leg, to lose momentum, fall away from the leaders, before powering through with such resilience and vigour over the last 200m, that her win suddenly came to seem inevitable. And, indeed, it was.</p> <p>As we watched her through those last bars of God Save the Queen, I realised that another reason I'd made the comment was that it was so long since I'd seen a woman being celebrated simply for what she'd done, that the image had come as some sort of shock to the system. Here was a woman being venerated for her power rather than her femininity, as a figure of absolute achievement and action and ambition. This wasn't about how Nicole Cooke looked, or what her success could sell, or who she might or might not be sponsored by. This was about Nicole Cooke and her will to win. Nicole Cooke and her toughness. Nicole Cooke's actions in the past few hours, not to mention all the hours of work she had put in during every one of her 25 years.</p> <p>And it wasn't long before another image of British female achievement popped up on my television screen. In the women's 400m freestyle swimming, the upper hand seemed to lie clearly with non-British competitors for most of the race, and in the final length it seemed that US swimmer Katie Hoff was bound to take it. At the last second, the 19-year-old British swimmer Rebecca Adlington pushed her nerve and verve and muscle beyond all expectation and cruised suddenly, shockingly, to a fingertip win. The BBC commentators were astounded. \"How on earth did she get Hoff?\" they said. \"Holy moley!\" And if the excitement of Adlington's win - the first Olympic gold for a British female swimmer in 48 years - wasn't enough, there was also the thrill of her teammate, 21-year-old Joanne Jackson, coming in third. As the two young women bobbed, exhausted, at the end of the swimming pool, taking in their triumph, beaming, hugging each other, tears welling in their eyes, it was another moment in which nothing mattered except their stunning achievement.</p> <p>Watching the swimming, tears pricking in my own eyes, I was confused as to why these images were hitting me so hard. Why did they seem so unusual - even unprecedented? I had seen Olympic events before. God knows I had seen people swim and cycle and ride horses. But at this particular moment, for some reason, these images of women seemed more significant than ever.</p> <p>Of course, Olympic events have always been important to female spectators, partly because we see so little women's sport the rest of the time. As we went to press, the only Team GB competitors to have won medals were women, and yet women's sporting achievements are usually entirely overlooked. A recent report by the Women's Sport and Fitness Foundation (WSFF), Backing a Winner: Unlocking the Potential in Women's Sport, offered a stark range of statistics to this effect, statistics even worse than the biggest feminist-pessimist could ever have imagined. For instance, an analysis of all the national daily newspapers over the course of three days in March found that \"just 2% of articles and 1% of images in the sports pages of national newspapers are devoted to female athletes and women's sports ... Just 1.4% of sports photography featured women; and despite the fact our research only looked at the sports' pages, there were more images of models, footballers' girlfriends, the French president's wife and a nun than of sportswomen.\"</p> <p>The outlook wasn't any better when it came to other media. During the same period in March, Sky allocated just three of its 72 hours of sports programming to women's events. And of the 10 sports internet sites the WSFF reviewed, \"there were 367 links from the front page to articles, but just five links went to female sports (1%). There was not one image of a female athlete on the front page of the top 10 websites. Out of 129 images (both photos and film) - there were four images of women (3%): Sky Sports did have a film of two female sports presenters, a third image was of [former Big Brother contestant] Kate Lawler in her underwear in a marathon photograph shot, and a fourth image was of an advert for women's health.\"</p> <p>In the face of this, the Olympics represents a rare two-week period in which women's events are allocated almost as much coverage as those of their male counterparts. At Athens in 2004, women represented 40.7% of all the athletes who competed, taking part in 45% of all events. There are still a few areas in which women cannot compete - there is no women's ski jumping at the Winter Olympics, for example, and, as Nicole Cooke and fellow British cyclist Victoria Pendleton have pointed out, women can only enter three events at the velodrome, compared with seven events for the male competitors. But, for the most part, the Olympics represents something close to parity. It is a competition in which we can watch women take on a massive range of challenges - from archery to athletics to one of the most compelling events of this Olympics so far, the women's weightlifting.</p> <p>As the years have passed, more and more events have been added to the female competition; in 1998, women's ice hockey joined the roster, in 2002, women's bobsleigh, in 2004, women's wrestling. And audiences seem to pay the same amount of respect to each event, regardless of the sex of those participating. As Harriet Foxwell, head of communications for the WSFF, says, during the Olympics, there is a real \"team ethos, an interest in what the British team is doing as a whole. There isn't a separation between male and female events.\"</p> <p>In this sense the Olympics is quite different to another sport that gives similar weight to male and female coverage: tennis. I enjoy tennis a great deal, but when it comes to coverage of the women's events at Wimbledon, for instance, there seems to be at least as much focus on what the women are wearing, what kind of shape they're in, how they're styling their hair, who's designing their outfits and whether or not they are grunting, as there is on their actual performance. The women at Wimbledon are fantastic athletes - you only had to watch this year's final between Serena and Venus Williams to recognise that - but they are also often objectified to a worrying degre. As Gina Dessalines, co-founder of the website <a href=\"http://www.womensportreport.com\">womensportreport.com</a>, says: \"When you see the camera shots that are taken when the female players are on court, and you compare that with the camera shots when the male players are on court, there's definitely an attitude that they're looking for the feminine shot - those moments when they can zoom in on a woman's legs, for example. And then, in all the tennis coverage, there's the massive interest in fashion. Even the people who are interviewing the women, post-match, will say, 'How are you going to dress for tonight's event?' which is a long way off the point.\"</p> <p>Foxwell agrees. \"What's great with the Olympics is the immediacy of it all - you see the women competing, and then they're on the rostrum straight away, looking incredibly natural, and that's so great to see. When it comes to tennis coverage, there are so many links between the sports and the fashion worlds now - a lot of the promotion around Wimbledon this year concerned parties, for instance, rather than just that specific focus on the sports field.\"</p> <p>The biased nature of the tennis coverage is interesting, and the focus on femininity rather than ferocity is certainly galling, but it has existed in other years too, and has never made the Olympics seem especially more feminist by comparison. In fact, I think, what is making this year's competition so rapturous for women is the contrast of the Olympic coverage with the general media attitude to women over the past four years. The celebrity culture, the reality-show culture, the tendency to venerate women who are presented as airheads, stretches back long before 2004, but it is in the past few years that it has reached its zenith. And it is in the past few years, also, that it has taken its ugliest turn, and we have seen an increasing cultural obsession with women on the verge of a nervous breakdown, women who are clearly in psychological turmoil, in and out of rehab, stumbling along the street, with blood on their face and legs and shoes. The image of women that we have been sold for the past few years has been one in which, at best, we are valued only for our looks. More commonly, it seems, we're represented as broken, bedraggled and bewildered.</p> <p>And it is, most pertinently, against this backdrop that the stars of Beijing 2008 have been performing. Recently our expectations of coverage of women have been lowered, nullified; we have become used to seeing that strange category - celebrity women - pictured constantly, relentlessly, their image before us for no other reason than that they happen to have headed out for a pint of milk with their makeup on skew-whiff. At Beijing we have seen the antithesis of that - we have been treated to the sight of ordinary women reaching extraordinary heights. The women we have been thrilling to aren't in our eyeline because they happen to be the offspring of some 1970s rocker, or because they've bagged a multimillionaire boyfriend. They aren't on screen because they have starved themselves to a size zero - instead, their bodies are a celebration of strength. They are women like Cooke, who grew up in Wick, in the Vale of Glamorgan, and has become the first British cyclist, male or female, to win an Olympic road race. Or like Adlington, from Mansfield, who started swimming at the age of seven at her local swimming pool and says that her motto is to \"have fun, there's no point otherwise\". Or Jackson, who comes from Richmond in North Yorkshire and swims for her local club, Derwentside.</p> <p>These are women whose success is an incredible testament to their strength of will, but also represents something accessible - Cooke has spoken about her memories of getting her first bike, memories which will strike a chord with many a kid, while all those provincial children trotting off to their swimming lessons next weekend can remember the fact that Adlington and Jackson got off to just the same start.</p> <p>Will this Olympics change the way that we see women? It's very early days yet. It has the potential to do so if these notable successes lead to a general increase in the coverage of women's sport, because, as Foxwell notes, visible role models can lead to increased sporting participation, which ultimately can result in increased happiness, confidence and success.</p> <p>Whether this year's event represents a short- or long-term improvement in coverage of women and our achievements or not, we should bask in the next two weeks. Just compare the image of Adlington and Jackson, dressed in their power racing suits, celebrating their success, faces lit up with incredulous joy, with that image of Paris Hilton last week, dressed in a cut-out swimsuit, reclining on a sun lounger, mouthing someone else's words in what was, admittedly, a funny rebuke to John McCain. Straggly hair and all, it's clear which of those images is the most inspiring. Let's take to our sofas and enjoy it.</p> <h2>Claire Tolley profiles six British women to watch out for at the Beijing Olympics</h2> <p><strong>Heather Fell, modern pentathlon, 25</strong></p> <p>Fell was ranked fourth in the world going into the games in a gruelling 12-hour event that combines fencing, shooting, a 200m freestyle swim, showjumping and a 3km run. Her training day starts at 5am with a two-hour swim, followed by running or riding before lunch, then shooting or fencing. She was named the British Olympic Association's \"one to watch\" for 2007 after winning silver at the European championship and is hoping for a podium place after setting personal bests in May this year in the swim and the run. The Devon-based penathlete, who graduated from Brunel University, has put a physiotherapy career on hold in her attempt to win Olympic gold and instead works on Friday afternoons in her local pub to keep her grounded.</p> <p><strong>Sarah Ayton, sailing (yngling class), 28</strong></p> <p>Ayton hopes to win a second gold to add to the Olympic title she won with Sarah Webb and Shirley Robertson in the Athens Olympics in 2004, when their success earned them overnight celebrity and the patronising nickname \"three blondes in a boat\". Now with Ayton at the helm with Webb and new crew member Pippa Wilson, the trio came to Beijing having won back-to-back world championship titles and the test event at the Olympic sailing venue in Qingdao. Ayton, who started sailing at the age of six, is engaged to British windsurfer Nick Dempsey, who won bronze in Athens. The pair, who will marry in October, have agreed that if one of them wins the gold here they will have the right to keep their name. If both win gold, their surnames will be double-barrelled.</p> <p><strong>Debbie Flood, rowing (quadruple sculls), 28</strong></p> <p>Yorkshire-born Flood won silver four years ago in Athens and hopes to go one better this time with her crew of Frances Houghton, Annie Vernon and Katherine Grainger. A devout Christian, she excelled at athletics as a teenager and was selected for the national youth squad at judo, but a chance session on a rowing machine at her father's gym revealed a talent for the sport. After a summer course with Tideway Scullers at Eton College aged 16, she opted to pursue rowing at the highest level. Whatever happens in Beijing, though, she will quit the sport for a year to work full-time in the prison service before returning to train for the 2012 games.</p> <p><strong>Shanaze Reade, cycling (BMX), 19</strong></p> <p>The Crewe teenager is the favourite to win gold when BMX makes its Olympic debut after cruising to victory in this year's world championships. Nicknamed \"Speedy Readey\", she beat all male competitors to become British No 1 in 2006. She made her seniors debut the following year, becoming women's world BMX champion and winning the world team sprint track title with Victoria Pendleton. When deciding what GCSEs to take, she got a phone call. \"My coach rang to say BMX had been introduced to the Olympics. That was it. I'd wanted to be an English teacher but you can go back to college. You can't go back to being an Olympic gold medallist.\"</p> <p><strong>Beth Tweddle, gymnastics (asymmetric bars), 23</strong></p> <p>The South Africa-born gymnast has endured a tough time in the games, missing out on the floor final and struggling into the bars final in eighth place as she recovers from a rib injury. With the final next Monday, however, Tweddle will be hopeful of conjuring a performance to match the quality that made her world and European champion in the discipline two years ago. Beijing will be Tweddle's final Olympics - she is planning a career in physiotherapy when she retires after next year's world championships having combined training six hours a day, six days a week, with studying to complete a sports science degree last summer.</p> <p><strong>Kelly Sotherton, athletics (heptathlon), 31</strong></p> <p>In Athens four years ago, all eyes were on the defending champion, Britain's Denise Lewis, but the surprise medallist was the then 27-year-old Sotherton, ranked only 21st in the world. Moments after winning bronze, Sotherton was in tears after her and Lewis's coach, Charles van Commenee, branded her a wimp for not running quick enough in the 800m to win silver. The tears dried and Sotherton, an outspoken former debt collector, admitted Van Commenee was absolutely right. With the Olympic champion Carolina Kluft deciding not to compete in Beijing, Sotherton knows she has to grasp a last chance for Olympic gold - providing she can overcome her jitters in the javelin.</p>",
  "<p>Ah, the lazy days of summer. Colleagues on holiday, contacts unreachable, not even any sunshine to complain about. But if you are feeling listless and underemployed, spare a little sympathy for the paparazzi of Los Angeles, who are facing calls for legislation to curb their excesses. Or, you know, don't. Happily for the snappers, LA police chief Bill Bratton is on their side, interrupting a recent morning workout to defend the paps to a local TV station. \"If you notice,\" he said, \"since Britney started wearing clothes and behaving, Paris is out of town not bothering anybody any more, thank God, and, evidently, Lindsay Lohan has gone gay, we don't seem to have much of an issue.\" This is the same Chief Bratton who has reportedly been advising Boris Johnson on his crime policy, starting with a zero tolerance approach to minor crimes. Including celebrity bad behaviour? Ooh, delicious prospect.</p> <p>Not everyone is idle, of course. Hot on the heels of Niccol\u00f2 Miliband's shockingly controversial article in this paper last month (\"I still believe we can win the next election\") comes a piece by Ed Balls in yesterday's Independent entitled \"Tests are tools to help children achieve the best\". Miliband, you will recall, sparked a political storm by failing to mention the name of a certain prime minister in his article, widely read as a bid for the party leadership. And looky here. Not a single mention of you know who in Balls's piece either. The schools minister would doubtless make some specious argument about this being a policy-heavy piece on the key stage testing system and nothing to do with the leadership, but he's not fooling us. So \"the current national testing system is not set in stone... there may well be changes\", Mr Balls? I think we all know what you're really saying. </p> <p>My northerly colleague Martin Wainwright's recollection last week of the Skibbereen Eagle's warning to Tsar Nicholas that it was watching him, puts one in mind of the (seemingly apocryphal) accounts of several local papers' reactions to the sinking of the Titanic, perhaps most deliciously the Aberdeen Press and Journal's reputed \"Aberdeenshire Man Drowned at Sea: He was a butcher in Union Street\". Though this tale, alas, is a fiction, it is good to see that newspapers have not lost their eye for the local in a big overseas story. And so to the Belfast News Letter, which yesterday had the exclusive: \"Ulstermen vow to stay in Georgia terror zone\". David McDowell and Gavin Adams, both from the province, are holidaying in Tbilisi, the paper revealed, but are \"not unduly alarmed\" by the fighting. \"We're Ulstermen and we've paid for this holiday and we're going to enjoy it,\" Mr McDowell revealed. Should the airport be closed, \"we have been told ... we should make our way overland through the mountains to Armenia which I think would be a great adventure\". Fingers crossed everyone!</p> <p>Never mind the air pistol shooting and the synchronised weight-thrusting, we at the Diary giddily await the return of the Premiership in just four days' time. But what's this? A midfielder who played for a football team last season and remains under contract will, it transpires, play for them this season. Total number of articles linking Cristiano Ronaldo to a move from Manchester United? 2,061. Was it Noam Chomsky who said that sport exists to distract us from \"the questions that really matter for human life\"?</p> <p>And speaking of things that didn't happen ... though the Press and Journal's headline may be a fiction, we were delighted to spot the following, evidently accurate, Titanic report from the San Francisco Examiner, headlined: \"SF Doctor Not On Ill-Fated Ship\". \"Dr WE Hopkins,\" the paper revealed to a relieved city, \"an eye, ear and throat specialist of San Francisco, was not a passenger on the Titanic.\" Coincidentally, the Diary is aware of a number of others who were also not passengers on the Titanic but who have never, perhaps unjustly, been recognised for their achievement. There may be others. If you did not drown in 1912, have never spotted Madeleine McCann, do not date a Premiership footballer, are not planning to run for president of the US and will not win an Olympic medal, the Diary would love to hear from you.</p>",
  "<p>The mobile phone industry is considering introducing cinema-style classifications for mobile phone content, to prevent children using the latest internet-enabled handsets to access websites that contain unsuitable material.</p> <p>Increasingly, children are using mobile phones to access the internet and download content, raising concerns about what they can view. More than half of nine-year-olds and 95% of 15-year-olds already have a mobile phone.</p> <p>The regulator, Ofcom, yesterday gave a relatively clean bill of health to the mobile phone industry's four-year-old code of conduct, which bars content deemed suitable only for people over the age of 18 from being seen by children.</p> <p>But the watchdog asked whether a \"more granular\" system, that takes into account the differences between, say, a 17-year-old and an eight-year-old, might not be better.</p> <p>Ofcom's report is part of a review of the code by the Mobile Broadband Group, which represents the UK's five networks and Virgin Mobile Last week it suggested that a need may soon emerge for more sophisticated filters \"that could allow younger children to be prevented from accessing certain material that parents might consider more suitable for older teenagers\".</p> <p>Under the present code, which was devised in 2004, the mobile phone companies set up an independent classification body to label commercial content accessible through their own web portals, as suitable for over-18s. That body bases its decisions on independent standards such as those used by the British Board of Film Classification.</p> <p>No over-18 content can be accessed until a mobile phone user contacts their network provider and goes through an age verification process, usually involving giving a credit card number.</p> <p>Content available over the mobile internet, however, does not go through the classification process. Instead the mobile phone companies have introduced filtering technology designed to exclude content that is similar to the 18-rated material available on their mobile portals.</p> <p>The Mobile Broadband Group suggested last week that parents may increasingly ask for more sophisticated filters so they can prevent younger children from accessing content that may be appropriate for an older teenager. Its proposals are open to consultation until November 7.</p> <p>Some mobile phone companies, such as 3, put warnings on content that may offend consumers. O2 has already introduced an enhanced \"parental control\" option which restricts what a mobile phone user can access to a \"whitelist\" of 22,000 websites which the operator has deemed suitable for children under 12. </p> <p>In order for such services to be effective, parents need to know they are available. Ofcom stressed in its report yesterday that parents need to have better information about what content controls are available when they buy a phone.</p> <p>It urged retailers to make more effort to ascertain the age of the ultimate user of any handset they sell.</p>",
  "<p>The media department at Cirencester College in Gloucestershire is proud of its A-level record - with a 99% pass rate, it should be. But a couple of years ago it had a problem. Staff had accurately predicted students' grades in five of the six media studies units they had to pass, but in the other something seemed amiss. The college did what schools all over the country increasingly do in these circumstances, and asked to see the scripts. \"There were some very good papers on which we couldn't understand why the grades were so low, and there were others we felt had been over-graded,\" says Andy Freedman, head of media at the college.</p> <p>When the exam board refused to change the grades, the college embarked on a formal appeals process. Almost a year later, it finally learned five students were to have their marks revised upwards. \"It felt like natural justice wasn't being delivered,\" Freedman says. \"If something that looks like a B is only given an E, it's difficult to sit there and do nothing about it.\" </p> <p>Usually such disputes are settled quickly, with a student receiving a grade-change or accepting the original mark, and just a handful of cases each year go to a full hearing of the Examination Appeals Board, as Cirencester's did. But it is becoming increasingly common for schools to query their students' results. </p> <p>With A-level students due to receive their results this week, exam boards are bracing themselves for a fresh wave of complaints. The recent furore over the marking of Sats is fresh in everyone's minds and confidence in the marking system is low. And research carried out for the government's exam agency has revealed growing disquiet about A-levels in particular.</p> <p>The study, carried out by Ipsos Mori for the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority, found that while teachers still had faith in A-levels generally, they were increasingly worried about their marking. Almost four out of 10 A-level teachers who were questioned last autumn felt quality had deteriorated in the previous two years. The proportion concerned about incorrect grading and marking of exam papers had almost doubled in two years, to one in five.</p> <p>Half the respondents said they had to make queries about their students' grades to ensure accuracy. When asked why, many said there seemed to be a lack of experienced markers or that requests for re-marking often showed up errors. One in six said a high proportion of results needed checking each year. </p> <p>Some schools now routinely query a large proportion of their results in the hope of pushing up grades. At Oundle school in Northamptonshire, staff ask for marks to be rechecked on between 100 and 150 of their students' 650 A-level grades. Phil Hanley, the independent school's examinations officer, says the proportion has increased dramatically in recent years. \"Eight years ago we did between 50 and 60 each year, for GCSE and A-level,\" he says. \"We deal with five times that number now - it's a full-time job through September, just keeping up with them.\"</p> <p>It costs around \u00a345 to ask for a mark to be rechecked and up to \u00a3200 for a formal appeal, and Hanley is frank about the fact that Oundle has more money to spend than a state school. He believes the rising level of suspicion is a natural result of increased transparency. Students used to receive only their overall grades, but now they are given the exact marks for each module of each exam. \"I think it's a natural consequence of having more information,\" he says. \"When I took A-level you got your grade B and that was it, job done. Now you know you got a B because you did this well in one paper and that well in another. If one wasn't very good, then let's get a re-mark to see if we can wallop the grade up.\"</p> <p><strong>Quality control</strong></p> <p>ETS, the marking agency that failed to get national curriculum test results to schools on time this year, does not set or mark A-levels. Nonetheless, Martin Ward, deputy general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, says schools are likely to be particularly jittery about the quality of marking this year. \"Anything like this calls the whole system into question,\" he says. \"While there's no logical reason to think that because ETS got into difficulty with tests there will be a problem with the A-level boards, people will tend to be more sensitive this year.\"</p> <p>But in addition to these recent troubles, he says, there is a longer-term trend for schools to query a higher proportion of results. \"Over, say, 10 or 15 years, it's quite clear that the chances of an appeal actually making a difference to the grade has increased, and that will tend to increase the number of appeals that are put in. When I was an examinations officer in a school in the 1980s, I would say to students: 'Don't waste your money - the chances are you screwed up an answer'. In recent years there's been a tendency to say: 'Give it a go - you may go up a grade'.\"</p> <p>Confidence in marking is at least higher now than it was in 2002, when 300,000 papers had to be re-marked after the Qualifications and Curriculum Agency was accused of pressuring boards to keep marks down. Yet the number of queries was greater last year than at any time since 2003, with a total of 58,000 - one for every 36 subject entries. In 2006, there were 53,000 queries, or one for every 39 subject entries. However, the proportion of overall grades changed as a result remained small, at around one for every 300 subject entries. </p> <p>Last year the number of queries on GCSE marks were proportionately lower, at around one for every 84 subject entries, but were more likely to result in a grade-change, with about one in five proving successful. Earlier this year the government set up a new exam regulator, Ofqual, whose first chair, Kathleen Tattersall, caused something of a stir at its launch by saying that there were bound to be variations between markers and that the public's perception that the system should be perfect was \"simplistic\".</p> <p><strong>Results 'health check'</strong></p> <p>An Ofqual spokeswoman said the regulator would be conducting an in-depth \"health check\" this autumn to see just how reliable our exam results are - and also how reliable we should expect them to be. An expert panel would be appointed to oversee the work, she said.</p> <p>Marsha Elms, headteacher of Kendrick girls' school in Reading, says the problem is not just with A-level: there is increasing concern about exam marking in general. And with new vocational qualifications about to come on stream, she fears the quality of markers may deteriorate further.</p> <p>\"I think the system is so stretched that we are beginning to lose faith - we are increasingly asking for re-marks,\" she says. \"But I do think it's also to do with the clientele, wanting rechecks as it becomes more difficult to get into the best universities - people want Cs turned into Bs and Bs turned into As.\"</p> <h2> A-level anxiety</h2> <p><strong>1 in 5:</strong> Proportion of A-level teachers questioned who were concerned about incorrect grading and marking of exam papers.</p> <p><strong>58,000:</strong> Number of scripts queried last year - one for every 36 subject entries, the highest number since 2003.</p> <p><strong>50%:</strong> Proportion of respondents who had queried their students' grades to ensure accuracy.</p>",
  "<p>The detached house in a Manchester suburb where Linda Walker has lived for 23 years and brought up her daughter and twin sons is up for sale. She and her partner John Cavanagh can no longer afford the mortgage because Linda no longer has a full-time teaching job. It was near this house that, four years ago this week, Walker lost her temper and found fame. Or notoriety, depending on your point of view. On that moonlit August evening, she was driven to fury by a relatively trivial last straw: someone had picked up a five litre container of water and emptied it over her son's car. This was the climax of a series of thefts, petty vandalism and abusive phone calls that had gone on for two years. Walker snapped.</p> <p>A few hundred yards away along the main road through Flixton she confronted a group of youths and told them: \"Don't come to our house again because if you do, I've got guns.\" They challenged her to get the weapons. So she did. She went home, picked up her son's air rifle and, from her knicker drawer, the air pistol Cavanagh had bought to scare away squirrels. She rang the police and told them: \"I have got an air rifle and I have got a pistol and I am going to shoot the fucking vandals who come around here.\" And then, with diamante flip-flops on her feet and the guns in her hands, she left the house and went back to the road. She describes what happened next - \"It was like an out of body experience\" - in her book Yobs On The Doorstep, out next month.</p> <p><strong>Taking them on</strong></p> <p>\"'Go on then, shoot me you silly old woman,' he said. He was so near now that I worried he might try to grab the pistol, but I knew that if I backed off I would lose face. As if to reinforce this, he slowly moved his right foot right up against mine. Toe to toe. 'Move your foot,' I said. He didn't. I pointed the gun at his foot. Still he didn't move. I obviously wasn't going to shoot him so I moved it to the side of his foot and shot it at the pavement. It was as if to say: 'I could have done it, but I didn't.' The gun made a pathetic puff. I had his attention now, so I fired the gun twice more at the tarmac away from us.\"</p> <p>Walker is adamant that no pellets were in the pistol. But she was arrested, charged with affray and possession of a firearm. At her trial in February 2005, she was convicted and given a six-month jail sentence, three of them suspended. Cavanagh was charged with affray and acquitted. The book is Walker's testament, her account of four turbulent years during which she has been greatly cheered by many letters of support and a 12,000-signature petition. </p> <p>Now the book is complete, she has had time to look back on an extraordinary period that took her from a school in Salford, to a crown court, three prisons, the appeal court (where her sentence was reduced to a 12-month conditional discharge) and a series of appeals and tribunals. \"I'm very sorry for what I did and realise I shouldn't be allowed to do that,\" she says as she sits in her conservatory on a warm evening. \"But before I did that my life was totally intolerable because I didn't know what was going to happen next.\"</p> <p>But she never wakes in the night thinking, \"I wish I had never done that\". The need to defend her sons, then 18, was overpowering: their cars had been attacked and one, who has since come out as gay, was called a poof in one of the anonymous calls. \"I'm not having anybody bully my kids. John said it was like a lioness with her cubs. I'd had enough of them targeting my children.\" </p> <p>She says she is no longer angry, but - rightly or wrongly - she remains bitterly critical of the way that the police handled the case and claims they did not investigate her complaints. \"I don't bear any animosity towards [those who targeted the family home] now. They don't give us grief any more. I feel I have had far more damage done to me by the police. They could have done something about stopping what was going on; they could have helped us more.\" </p> <p><strong>Extreme behaviour</strong></p> <p>Before that fateful August night, Walker had had plenty of experience of troubled young people. For three years she had been head of food technology and careers coordinator at a Salford school for children with social, emotional and behavioural difficulties. A significant part of the book talks of the challenges she faced and the pleasure small breakthroughs brought. \"I had become ensconced in a world where extreme behaviour was the norm and ceased to be shocked by it,\" she writes. </p> <p>However, after failing Ofsted inspections, the school went into special measures at a time Walker was facing other stresses. \"The pupils were out of control and it felt like a pressure cooker ready to blow,\" she writes. \"School was a very stressful place to work and I think I was still grieving for my mum [who had recently died]. But what was driving me to despair was the fear that in some way the attacks on our home were related to my boys and I feared for their safety.\" </p> <p>Walker's sense of injustice led to battles with the police, courts, the prison system (she went on hunger strike for three days) and her employers. She describes herself as awkward and stubborn. Salford city council sacked her in May 2005; she appealed, lost, and then appealed again to an employment tribunal, where she lost again. But in February 2007, the then DfES cleared her to teach and a year later the General Teaching Council issued a two-year reprimand. \"This was the lowest sanction, tantamount to a telling off,\" writes Walker. \"I was really pleased. I didn't feel vindicated but I did feel I now had some credibility again. The panel had risked public criticism to impose the lowest sanction against me and I was grateful.\" The GTC said she had shown remorse and insight into her behaviour, that she had acted when under considerable pressure and was unlikely to do anything similar again.</p> <p>Walker wrote her book with the help of a \u00a325,000 cheque from the Mail On Sunday to which she sold her story. She now teaches a few classes at Salford College, but money is tight. Her experience of prison where she served 36 days is fully described in the book. She recalls \"the utter futile frustration of being incarcerated, isolated, removed from my life; the agony of separation from those I love and the pain of those who love me; the boredom, the waste of precious time, the removal of free will\"; all that will be \"engraved in my consciousness for ever\".</p> <p>Walker never expected to be jailed. She went to court for sentence singing Is This the Way to Amarillo? She wore high-heeled patent leather shoes and did not take a change of clothes. Once her fate was known, she was taken from the dock to the cells. And there she wrote a note for Cavanagh, telling him how to deal with the loads of washing she had left in the kitchen at the home that is now for sale.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Yobs on the Doorstep: The Manchester Gun Teacher's Story by Linda Walker with Clarissa Satchell (Guardian Angel Publications) will be available soon from <a href=\"http://www.yobsonthedoorstep.com\">yobsonthedoorstep.com</a></p>",
  "<p>It came as no surprise to Dick Hobbs, professor of sociology at the London School of Economics, when he made Patsy Kensit cry. An expert on violence and organised crime, he had been asked to contribute to an edition of the BBC programme \"Who do You Think You Are?\", due to be broadcast tomorrow, in which the actress explores her family background. (Last night, he appeared on BBC4's The Real Life on Mars, arguing that 70s cops really were as bad as depicted in the John Simm TV series.)</p> <p>\"All I knew about Patsy Kensit's dad was that he was a grass,\" says Hobbs. After some research, including talking to former London gang members \"Mad\" Frankie Fraser and Eddie Richardson, he knew more, but none of it was likely to please Kensit. The extent of Jimmy \"The Dip\" Kensit's involvement in crime was shocking, says Hobbs. Not only was he a well-known pickpocket and close associate of the Krays - indeed he made Reggie Kray his son's godfather - but he had also been arrested a couple of times simply for being \"an incorrigible rogue\". Then there was the fact that he'd given evidence against the Richardson brothers in order to get himself out of prison.</p> <p>Being a grass isn't quite as big a deal as people like to think, says Hobbs. He claims the idea that some kind of moral code exists among villains, which means they don't inform on each other, is a myth. In fact, many of the big organised crime cases, from the Brinks Mat gold heist to the activities of the Kray twins, were solved because people were willing to inform. Everyone knew Jimmy Kensit had snitched, but he didn't suffer any consequences. </p> <p><strong>The night-time economy</strong></p> <p>Underlying much of Hobbs's work, which has examined gun crime, bouncers, drug trafficking and the night-time economy, is the view that villainy is not necessarily that big a deal either. Just as villains' approach to informing on their mates has often been based more on practicality than morality, so has their approach to crime. \"I want to get away from the idea that crime is an extraordinary activity,\" he says. \"It is normal, and a part of everyday life.\"</p> <p>This is a view formed after a childhood spent in the East End of London, and an academic career dedicated to talking to others about their lives in a big city. Few of us can say we have taken no part in the criminal marketplace, whether buying cheap drink or a knocked-off DVD, he claims, and for most city dwellers, crime is something they take for granted, which they negotiate as victims, perpetrators, and often as both. It comes some way down their list of concerns, below educating their children and keeping their jobs. Where it does worry them, it is usually in terms of vandalism or noise rather than drug-running or guns. And for a significant minority it can offer meaning, status and money in their pockets.</p> <p>\"If you are a victim of crime it is a terrible thing,\" says Hobbs. \"But crime can be quite life enhancing for people. It gives them a buzz. A little bit of the day is theirs. If they have a mundane job and have nicked something from work or taken a packet of drugs, it gives them the feeling they have some control over their lives. They enjoy it; otherwise, they wouldn't do it.\"</p> <p>This is not to say the nature of crime and violence has remained constant. When he began his research 20 years ago, anyone carrying a gun was a specialist. \"He was known as a shooter, and these weren't random acts,\" he says. \"It was someone who would use weapons as part of their job.\" If guns were used in a vendetta, it demonstrated a major step up - a step across the line - whereas now, he says, guns are more likely to be used simply because there are more of them around. The kind of violent feuds once associated only with professional criminals now seem to be taking place between children, he says - something he blames not only on the greater availability of weapons, but on a youth culture, which, dominated by consumerism and by the US, encourages young people to carry them.</p> <p>But, according to Hobbs, what has really transformed the nature of crime since he began studying it is the dominance of drugs and the instant and enormous fortunes they offer. Drugs, he says, have taken away any notion of criminal specialisation. \"Anyone can have a whip-round, take a cheap flight to Amsterdam and become an international drugs smuggler. Hijacking a lorry, robbing a bank, breaking a safe, or whatever, is impossible because of the levels of knowledge you'd need. Now, it's a complete and utter free for all. It's very democratic.\"</p> <p>Where once villains needed to come from the right criminal family and to serve an apprenticeship of several years to learn their safe-breaking or bank-robbing craft, the underworld has become more diffuse, fluid and multicultural, he says. While criminals have always had a streak of entrepreneurialism, crime itself has now gone from a craft to an international business. And just as city analysts seem to take in their stride the risk of getting things wrong, so the smugglers make realistic assessments about the risks of getting caught - which, on the whole, are not that high.</p> <p>Hobbs has just completed a piece of work for the Home Office in which he interviewed 230 drug smugglers in jail. One of the things he found was that prison wasn't much of a deterrent; they accepted the possibility of going to jail as part of the game. The thing that really worried them was having their assets taken away. \"The idea of coming out having spent 10 to 12 years inside - having no car, no money, family gone, back to the bare bones. That seemed to worry them far more.\"</p> <p><strong>Messenger boy</strong></p> <p>The business side of crime has always interested Hobbs, although he's never been anywhere near business himself. The son of a warehouseman and dressmaker, he left school at 17 with two O-levels and started work as a messenger boy for a publishing company, based in the building directly opposite his current office at the LSE. This was in 1968, and he says he used to watch the students preparing for global revolution while he was busy running errands.</p> <p>After getting further qualifications at night school, between clerical and manual jobs, including working as a dustman and roadsweeper, he taught in London primary schools, before taking a masters in sociology at the LSE, where he discovered a fascination for the sociology of crime. This was followed by a PhD at Surrey on the entrepreneurial nature of criminals and police officers in the East End, a study that became a prize-winning book Doing Business. It examined wheeling and dealing in the East End - minor fiddles carried out in warehouses, dodgy early morning deals before a van driver started his day job, CID information trades with villains. \"Some of it was legal and some wasn't and, in the end, it didn't matter what was and what wasn't,\" he says.</p> <p>The same attitude informs his drug-smuggler research. Carried out in collaboration with economists, it looks at drug dealing as an economic activity, studying questions involving pricing and transport, \"trying to break away from all the moral outrage that accompanies so much writing about drugs\".</p> <p>It is not the first time that Hobbs has been consulted by the government, although he is cynical about how much it will listen. As a professor at Durham University in the late 1990s, he carried out an extensive piece of research on alcohol and the night-time economy, which included a couple of his research colleagues working as bouncers. Like many experts, he advised that 24-hour pub opening would not solve Britain's alcohol problems. \"All the civil servants and MPs we spoke to agreed with us, but they went ahead anyway,\" he says. \"I think it's for economic reasons. We are so reliant now on pubs and clubs in city centres that if you take that away, what's going to be there?\"</p> <p>Many of the villains who have been Hobbs's contacts over the years have themselves fallen victim to drink, often bewildered by the changes that have taken place in their world over the past couple of decades - the loss of those armed robber fraternities in which, even if the rules were regularly broken, at least they were rules they understood. But in this nostalgia for their heyday, they differ little from their pensioner contemporaries in the legitimate world, says Hobbs.</p> <p>He also hesitates to say that the younger generation is any more prone to violence than it ever was. When he was growing up, a friend bled to death after being struck with a glass in a pub known as the Stabbers Arms because of the number of stabbings that took place. \"Violence was part of our lives and you became quite savvy about dealing with it,\" he says. </p> <p>Yet he concedes that \"there are certain communities that are undoubtedly racked with fear concerning children killing children\", and that in these places the issue of escalating violence is a real one. \"We need to be very very careful about how we approach it,\" he says. \"A lot of the media approach to both gun and knife crime has been surreptitiously racist.\" While the first reaction when a young person is killed is to relate it to gangs, often it has been the result some other kind of feud - to do with family or jealousy, he says. \"That's what we need to be careful about, because the whole gang thing has been turning it into a racist conversation rather than a conversation about changes in youth and changes in the way youth view the world.\"</p> <p>Personally, he feels in little danger because he no longer lives in the communities where violence is happening.

  "<p>He dropped out of the sky and left, an hour or so later, the same way, helicopter rotor blades driving a gritty dust storm from the dirt playing field into the faces of hundreds of Ethiopian hill villagers. They waved and clapped and shook the hand of a white-haired man who used to hold the most powerful office on the planet and who has just failed to help his wife secure it in her turn. Yet the people of Rema had no idea who William Jefferson Clinton was or what he was doing in their village.</p> <p>One man knew the name, though his wife looked blank. \"Clinton,\" said Awke Tiruneh, whose hut the president had been due to visit but didn't, because of the tight schedule powerful men run to. \"He is from Germany.\" It is the only foreign country Tiruneh has heard of, because a German NGO is based on Rema's doorstep, but he has not a clue where either Germany or America are. The outside world is the village on top of the next hill, a long, rocky walk down one mountain and up another.</p> <p>Yet Clinton came to put Rema on the map, hailing it as a model for the developing world and a place that could teach the US a thing or two. Rema, in the northern highlands, is now the first solar-powered village in Ethiopia - a cluster of 1,100 homes that shine in the dark evenings like white beads on a string. Every home has electric light from an energy-efficient LED bulb hanging from the straw ceiling. Children can do schoolwork after 6pm while women weave the gabi - a white cotton head-to-toe wrap that is worn in church and in the evenings to keep out the cold (now Clinton has one too). Night classes have started in the school for adults who want to learn to read, there is a solar-powered fridge at the health centre that cannot run out of fuel, and women no longer have to walk a mile to the well, thanks to a solar-powered pump. High-quality equipment has been installed that will last for 25 or 30 years. Villagers pay around 80p a month to cover the cost of maintenance and new batteries.</p> <p>Rema has become a model for the future energy needs of developing countries, Clinton believes. Solar power could be a revolution for Africa. \"It's the energy equivalent of the cellphone movement,\" he says.</p> <p>Bill is not the only Clinton whose imagination has been caught by this project. His 28-year-old daughter Chelsea is there too, as are Clinton's brother Roger and 14-year-old nephew Tyler. Chelsea took indefinite unpaid leave from her management consultancy job to help her mother's unsuccessful bid for the Democratic nomination. \"She wasn't back at a new task yet so she wanted to come with me, and I love it,\" her father tells me later in the presidential suite at the Addis Ababa Sheraton, whose marbled elegance and air conditioning would make a Rema villager's eyes pop. \"We like to travel together.\"</p> <p>The shade of Hillary's momentous campaign travels with them. Clinton speaks of it with a sort of warm afterglow, in spite of the panning he personally received. \"I'm immensely proud of Hillary,\" he says. \"Her performance in March, April and May, to June 3, was literally miraculous. If you'd told me, given the facts that existed on March 1, that she'd come back, win more popular votes, do as well as she did, I would never have believed it ... I thought she learned, she grew and I think by the end she was running like a house on fire.</p> <p>\"I'm very grateful actually, personally, that I had a chance to get out and see so much of America, because her only option after she lost all those caucuses in February and knew she was going to be outspent was to raise this incredible grassroots campaign. And Chelsea made 450 appearances for her mother. In the last three months alone I went to 350 different communities. I got to see parts of America I never saw when I was running or serving, and it was one of the most rewarding experiences of my life.\"</p> <p>Now, however, he is on a whistle-stop tour of his charitable foundation's projects in Africa: today Ethiopia, tomorrow Rwanda, the next day in and out of Liberia and on to Senegal. Much of it is to do with health - Clinton's influence, his ability to flatter, charm and persuade, has had great success in negotiating down drug prices for Aids and malaria for the developing world. He is pushing to increase dramatically the numbers of women with HIV given drugs in pregnancy to stop their babies becoming infected. But here in the northern highlands of Ethiopia, we are looking at ways to mitigate the effects of climate change.</p> <p>\"My whole theory about climate change is that the biggest problem in aggregate is the fact that India and China are about to pass the US in emissions and no country is going to agree to remain poor in order to avert climate change. We have to be able to show that there are economically viable options.</p> <p>\"I think it is really important that the vast mass of countries that are developing find ways to skip the carbon stage of economic development - ways that accelerate rather than undermine their wellbeing.\"</p> <p>Shouldn't the US take steps to reduce its own emissions before it starts visiting its ideas on Africa? \"I think that the United States does need to pass climate change legislation, we need to put a price on carbon, we need to set up a capping trade system and one that can't be cheated on: I agree with all that. But when people say that most loudly, they are usually looking for an excuse to do nothing, and if we burn up the planet then no one will give you laurels for having come up with the best available excuse to do nothing. Your grandchildren won't be proud of you. And we may have an irreversible situation,\" he says.</p> <p>\"Secondly, because all these developing countries have to be worried about the problems at hand, feeding the people that are there, educating them, providing basic healthcare, having some near-term economic strategy, I think that people like me who care about this stuff have to find economically attractive options for them.\"</p> <p>Environmentally friendly energy policies can go hand in hand with economic growth, he says. It's happened in the UK and Denmark, he says, two of only six countries - excluding \"some former communist countries that, prior to 1990, were running very, very dirty carbon-based inefficient industrial economies\" - that have been on course to meet their Kyoto target.</p> <p>\"The biggest problem with Kyoto was the United States bugged out on it, so it gave everybody an excuse to take a bath,\" he says.</p> <p>\"I'm not a government and I don't have access to vast amounts of money, and I'm frustrated that even when the Democrats are in, we still haven't given a tax credit, for example, for wind energy that goes more than three years. Nonetheless, somebody needs to go out there and help people figure out how to do this stuff. That's what I do. </p> <p>\"I just try to figure it out and I try to get other smart people around who figure out how to do this, because I was so struck by all these countries that won't meet their Kyoto targets. Most of them were not led by people who were dishonest when they signed Kyoto. They aren't lazy, they aren't stupid and they aren't corrupt. They're well-meaning, hard-working people who are, like all political leaders, facing all kinds of competing pressures in an economy that is not organised for tomorrow's energy - it's organised for yesterday's.</p> <p>\"One reason I went to that little village today is that that little village is now organised for tomorrow. I'll go home now and I'll be able to tell people that I went to the highlands of Ethiopia and saw a classroom with two LED lights - nobody will believe that - and that it works economically for them.\"</p> <p>The man who brought light to Rema was neither a former president nor a technology geek. Harald Sch\u00fctzeichel studied music and theology, he tells me. He started the Solar Energy Foundation because he wanted to help development. If there are environmental benefits, so much the better. He was completely astonished when he got an email saying Clinton wanted to visit. He is still not quite sure why, but he knows that the boss of Good Energies, the company that has donated 80% of his funding, is a friend of the former president.</p> <p>What Sch\u00fctzeichel does not realise is that Marcel Brenninkmeijer, founder and CEO of Good Energies, who also jumps out of the Clinton helicopter, is shelling out cash - it took \u00a3240,000 to equip Rema - because he is part of the Clinton Global Initiative (CGI). It is a kind of networking with good deeds attached. Clinton brings together wealthy businessmen and government leaders for an annual jamboree and they promise action on global problems, not just talk. If they fail to carry out their promises, they don't get invited again.</p> <p>Sch\u00fctzeichel, though, is innocent of the politics of global philanthropy. Clinton invites him to give a presentation to the next meeting in September. Afterwards, Sch\u00fctzeichel confesses he has no idea what the CGI is. He wants help to expand his solar-powered villages across Ethiopia by setting up a microfinance bank that will allow villagers to borrow money for solar power installation and pay it off at a rate they can afford. \"I need \u20ac10m [\u00a37.8m],\" he says, barely appreciating that he has just been handed his best-ever opportunity of getting it.</p> <p>Rema had its installation for free, to show what could be done. Down the hill from the village, Sch\u00fctzeichel has built an International Solar Energy School, which has trained 24 technicians from all over Ethiopia. The plan is for them to return to their regions and set up their own businesses, equipping more villages, which will borrow the necessary funds from Sch\u00fctzeichel's microfinance bank.</p> <p>We're thousands of miles away from the US, but not from its politics. Some of the foundation staff worked for Hillary's nomination and they talk of it as something momentous, with a sort of awe-struck sadness that they were part of it and she lost. \"I just want very much the country to change course,\" says Clinton. \"I want us to be on a different economic course, a different social policy course, a different course in the world. And we're going to do what we can to be helpful.\"</p> <p>What about criticisms of his role in Hillary's campaign? \"It's all part of the deal,\" he says, laughing. \"Look, what we were doing was working, so you had to assume there was going to be some blow-back. It's a contact sport, politics ... I would never have gotten back into politics if it hadn't been for Hillary, but I felt so strongly that she should be elected and she needed all of us - she needed Chelsea and she needed me. Our bodies made up for the financial disparity a little bit. And so we threw ourselves into the fray and did our best and you just get up and go on.</p> <p>\"And I'm immensely proud of her, but I think she's the political leader of our family now - I'm not in politics. And I'm going to do exactly what she says we should do and agree with her decision. I think she's been big and positive and that's what we should all be.\"</p> <p>And so he and Chelsea are in Africa to change the world in other ways. Rema's name will be spoken of in high circles, as a byword for environmentally friendly development. More visitors may descend from the skies. A solar-powered cinema is mooted, where films on development will be shown, so that Rema's people will understand what they can aspire to.</p> <p>Awke Tiruneh and his wife Emaye Beyene are not the only couple who are faintly bemused. They are pleased with their two lightbulbs, one in the main room and a second in the kitchen annexe of their pristine mud hut, and with the radio that everybody in Rema tunes to get music, not news. But they say they don't want anything else. </p> <p>\"When they have more money, they don't know what to do with it in Rema,\" says Samson Tsegaye, country director of the Solar Power Foundation. \"They are happy. They don't need a Mercedes or a television. When they have money, the men are always going to the bar. </p> <p>The solar cinema is to show them what money can do - how opportunity can come to their lives. They have three meals a day but they don't know what is going on in the world.\"</p> <p>Are Bill and Hillary Clinton, who have been at the centre of what is going on in the world, happier than the villagers of Rema? It's an interesting question.</p>",
  "<p>Sales of homes by Britain's estate agents are down 40% on a year ago as the strict lending conditions imposed by the credit crunch prevent first-time buyers securing a mortgage, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors says today. </p> <p>In its monthly health check of the property market, the body that represents estate agents said it expected prices to continue falling but that its members were hopeful of a pick-up in business.</p> <p>The RICS said it could detect some signs that the market was close to a floor, with new buyer inquiries and sales expectations higher and a small fall in the balance of surveyors reporting price falls. But with one estate agent saying that the first-time buyer was \"on the endangered list\", the RICS confirmed that the market was being affected by the financial market turmoil of the past year.</p> <p>\"Tighter credit conditions, in terms of both collateral requirements and generally wider lending margins, is impairing housing market activity,\" it said.</p> <p>Sales per surveyor stood at 14.4 in the three months to July, it said, down from 15.3 in the quarter ending in June. The balance of estate agents recording a fall in prices over the three months was a \"very negative\" 83.9%, but down from 86.9% in June and a peak of 94.7% in April.</p> <p>In addition to the headline price balance, the RICS said new buyer inquiries and newly agreed sales series improved for the third successive month. \"This might possibly reflect the more realistic pricing environment,\" it said.</p> <p>\"In terms of the outlook, the July survey lends further support to the notion that activity may be beginning to stabilise, albeit at a low level.\" </p> <p>Surveyors questioned by RICS were downbeat about the outlook, although in some parts of the country agents said they saw signs of an improved climate. \"It has been an encouraging month for sales - 25% up on June and just 20% down on July 2007,\" said James Buxton of Bidwells in Cambridge, who noted that a seven-bedroom house had sold for about \u00a33.5m - a record for the city.</p> <p>Quentin Jackson-Stops, of Jackson Stops and Staff in Northampton, said: \"Conditions are more difficult even than the 1990s because of a lack of first-time buyers entering the market due to a lack of available mortgage funding.\"</p> <p>Another surveyor, Malcolm Parker, of Joplings in North Yorkshire, said: \"The only properties attracting any interest are those offered at greatly discounted prices (ie repossessions, new builds on large developments) and the older rural properties. The first-time buyer is on the list of endangered species.\"</p> <p>A separate report today from the British Retail Consortium finds that the weakness of the property market was affecting demand for household goods and furnishings, helping to contribute to another poor month for business in the high street.</p> <p>The BRC said poor weather and belt-tightening by consumers had meant annual like-for-like sales were down in July for the fourth time in five months - retailing's worst run since 2005. The BRC's director-general, Stephen Robertson, said \"frivolous shopping is off the agenda\", adding that customers were concentrating on \"value and durability\". There was little sign of the slowdown in retailing bottoming out, Robertson said.</p> <p>Supermarkets were the only sector of the high street to report significant growth on July 2007, but the BRC said sales of furniture and furnishings were well below their levels of a year earlier for a sixth consecutive month. \"With no let-up in the housing market slowdown and the squeeze on incomes, forward orders pointed to further slowdown,\" the report said.</p> <p>With increasing demands on household budgets, the BRC said shoppers were reluctant to spend on non-necessities, and were now including clothes in this category. \"With shoppers increasingly cautious in spending tight budgets - and now often seeing clothes as more of a discretionary purchase - core basics, childrenswear and clearance bargains sold well.\"</p> <p>The survey found that retailers had responded with aggressive price cuts in the summer sales, but business remained difficult. \"Even heavy discounting often failed to tempt customers to buy,\" the BRC said.</p> <p>Total sales in July were 1.7% higher than in the same month a year ago, but the BRC said like-for-like sales were down 0.9%.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Newcastle United</strong><br>Michael Owen and Shola Ameobi are likely to be available for Newcastle's Premier League opener against Manchester United on Sunday.

Ben\u00edtez said on the club's website yesterday: \"He is progressing really well but we will check tomorrow after training.\" <strong>PA</strong></p>",
  "<p>There was one positive to emerge from Manchester City amid the turmoil surrounding the club's financial future yesterday when Mark Hughes confirmed he had prevented the popular defender, Vedran Corluka, from completing an \u00a38m move to Tottenham Hotspur. That City's new and increasingly frustrated manager was compelled to act at all, however, indicates how Thaksin Shinawatra's legal and political problems have radically altered the ambition that enticed Hughes from Blackburn Rovers 10 weeks ago.</p> <p>A spokesman for City last night denied claims that Corluka and Stephen Ireland had been offered for sale without the manager's knowledge and that the owner's decision to seek exile in the UK, and leave an estimated \u00a3800m in assets frozen in Thailand, had thrown the day-to-day running of the club into chaos. \"That is categorically untrue,\" he said.</p> <p>City claim that Corluka came close to joining Spurs - so close that the Croatian international passed a medical on Friday and is believed to have agreed personal terms over the weekend - only because of the attractive offer on the table from White Hart Lane and not because the club needed the money. </p> <p>Likewise Ireland, who was out shopping on Saturday afternoon when he received a call telling him to report for City's pre-season friendly defeat of Milan, was absent because of a miscommunication and not after being informed that Sunderland and Bolton were interested in his \u00a36m services. City's case in that respect was strengthened yesterday when Sunderland denied being in pursuit of the Republic of Ireland midfielder.</p> <p>Accepting a potential \u00a31m profit on Corluka, however, as the City hierarchy did last week, does not tally with the ambitions of a club that is supposed to be competing for European qualification under Hughes this season. Nor does it dispel the argument that, having pledged almost \u00a370m on transfer fees alone since purchasing the club for \u00a380m last summer and sought new investment in the club, It could be that Thaksin is struggling to pay the latest instalments on players signed by Sven-Goran Eriksson - frozen assets and the heat from the Thai Supreme Court being the principal reasons why.</p> <p>The deposed former Thai prime minister spent \u00a321.6m to buy City's shares last summer and a loan of \u00a319.2m previously owed to the former owners John Wardle and David Makin is now owed to Thaksin's company, UK Sports Investments Ltd. </p> <p>Of the 10 headline signings made since his arrival, only the recent \u00a35m acquisition of Tal Ben Haim involved money paid to an English club, in this instance Chelsea, with the remaining nine, including the the \u00a38m Elano, the \u00a319m Brazilian striker Jo and the \u00a38.8m Italian forward Rolando Bianchi, payable in several instalments. The second instalments on those deals are now due while loan fees for Nery Castillo, wages, severance pay for Eriksson and compensation to Blackburn for Hughes have also added to the costs for City and their owner.</p> <p>Doubts over Thaksin's ability to realise his goal of taking City into the Champions League hardened last week when it was confirmed he had appointed an intermediary to hold \"exploratory discussions\" with several potential investors, believed to be based in the Middle East and India, who can also help promote the club as a global brand. </p> <p>Yesterday the club reiterated that City were not up for sale, only seeking new partners, but should \u00a3800m remain frozen in Thailand, then a saleable Premier League outfit would represent an obvious way for Thaksin to recoup his losses.</p> <p>The impact for Hughes appears more immediate. City officials claim to be trying to add to the manager's squad, not detracting from it, despite accepting an offer for a defender - Corluka - who Hughes had made clear was an integral part of his future plans. The City manager talked the Croatian out of the move to London on Sunday afternoon but only, it is believed, after blocking the sale and insisting on the terms of a contract that gives him control over transfer policy.</p> <p>\"I am a huge admirer of Vedran. He is a top-class player with a bright future ahead of him and I am delighted that he continues to be a part of our plans at City,\" the manager said. \"It is a real boost for everyone at the club.\" Maybe not all.</p> <h2><strong>Thaksin's transfers</strong></h2> <p><strong>Ins</strong><br><strong>2007</strong><br>Bianchi (Reggina) \u00a38.8m<br>Fernandes (FC Sion) Undisc<br>Geovanni (Cruzeiro) Free<br>Petrov (A Madrid) \u00a34.7m; <br>Garrido (Sociedad) \u00a31.5m<br>Corluka (D Zagreb) \u00a37m<br>Blumer (Shakhtar Donetsk) \u00a38m<br>Bojinov (Fiorentina) \u00a36.6m</p> <p><strong>2008</strong><br>Caicedo (Basle) \u00a35.2m<br>Benjani (Portsmouth) \u00a33.9m<br>Jo (CSKA Moscow) \u00a318m<br>Ben Haim (Chelsea) \u00a35m<br><strong>Total \u00a368.7m</strong></p> <p><strong>Outs</strong><br><strong>2007</strong><br>Sinclair Released <br>Jordan Released <br>Trabelsi Released <br>D'Laryea Released <br>Matthewson Released <br>Williams Released <br>Distin (Portsmouth) Free<br>Barton Newcastle \u00a35.8m<br>Weaver (Charlton) Free</p> <p><strong>2008</strong><br>Laird (Millwall) Undisclosed<br>Dabo (Lazio) Undisclosed<br>Miller (West Bromwich) \u00a30.9m<br>Dickov Released <br>Geovanni (Hull) Free<br>Mpenza Released <br>Sun Jihai (Sheffield Utd) Free<br>Isaksson (PSV Eindhoven) Undisclosed <br>Samaras (Celtic) \u00a32m<br>Corradi (Reggina) Free<br>Mills (Doncaster) \u00a3300,000m <br><strong>Total \u00a39m</strong></p>",
  "<p>Speculation that the head of the government's exams agency will resign over the marking crisis which hit school tests this year mounted yesterday after he refused to rule out quitting his position. </p> <p>Ken Boston, who was brought in to run the Qualification and Curriculum Authority at the height of the A-level crisis of 2002, refused to comment on reports calling for him to resign over the delays to this year's Sats results. Asked by the Guardian if he was about to resign, a spokesman responded \"no comment\" and refused to answer further questions about Boston's future at the QCA. </p> <p>Headteachers said he should not be made a scapegoat for the problems which hit Sats this year. </p> <p>Ministers will today present the results of Sats for 14-year-olds despite thousands of pupils still waiting for their individual marks. The papers sat by 600,000 pupils bore the brunt of the marking problems at the American firm ETS which was brought in to run the tests this year. Schools are poised to launch a record number of appeals over results in a sign that confidence in the system has been compromised. </p> <p>Separately, the QCA's research reveals that schools' confidence in A-level results has also declined. Pupils will receive results of the year's A-levels on Thursday. The study on perceptions of A-levels and GCSEs, carried out by Ipsos Mori for the QCA, found that while teachers have faith in A-levels generally, they are increasingly worried about their marking. Almost four out of 10 A-level teachers who were questioned last autumn about 2007's exam season felt quality had deteriorated in the previous two years. The proportion concerned about incorrect grading and marking of exam papers had almost doubled in two years, to one in five.</p> <p>Half the respondents said they had to make queries about their students' grades to ensure accuracy. Many cited an apparent lack of experienced markers or that requests for re-marking often showed up errors. The number of queries was greater last year than since 2003, with a total of 58,000. However, the proportion of overall grades changed remained small, at around one for every 300 subject entries. </p> <p>The marking crisis that has affected this year's Sats has meant thousands of results are delayed. Reforms brought in by ETS proved so complicated that there were mass resignations by markers and the National Assessment Agency, the wing of the QCA responsible for the tests, has been forced to take over much of the process. QCA confirms it is in legal discussions with ETS about the future of the \u00a3156m contract, which is supposed to span the next four years. The crisis has been seized on by critics of the system as the \"last nail in the coffin\" of the national tests for 11- and 14-year-olds, which are deeply unpopular with many teachers.</p> <p>According to reports at the weekend Les Lawrence, the chairman of children and young people at the Local Government Association, is calling on Boston to take the blame for the appointment of ETS saying he is \"personally culpable\" for the failing to deal with the problems at ETS.</p> <p>Boston, an Australian examinations expert, has been at the QCA since 2002 when he promised to update the exam system he described as a \"Victorian cottage industry\". He is widely considered to have stabilised the system in the aftermath of the 2002 A-level crisis. The previous chairman of the QCA, Sir William Stubbs, was sacked by the then education secretary, Estelle Morris, after thousands of A-level papers had to be re-marked in 2002. </p> <p>Boston's contract is understood to be for another year but the creation of the exams watchdog Ofqual will see swaths of QCA's responsibilities transferred to it. Lord Sutherland has been appointed to lead an inquiry into the crisis, which will scrutinise the QCA's responsibility for the problems. </p> <p>John Dunford, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, called on Boston to rule out resigning. \"He should not be made a scapegoat over this issue. He is by far the best person to lead the QCA through this situation.\"</p> <p>An Ofqual spokeswoman said the regulator would be conducting an in-depth \"health check\" this autumn into the reliability of exam results. She said there would be \"no comment\" on Boston's future at the QCA.</p>",
  "<p>Police yesterday named the two Newcastle University graduates who were murdered in their flat after putting up a fight against unknown intruders.</p> <p>A motive has yet to be established for the killing of Xi Zhou and her boyfriend Zhen Xing Yang, both 25 and Chinese nationals, who were praised by academic staff as friendly and very hard-working.</p> <p>Forensic scientists are continuing to check the ground floor flat in Newcastle upon Tyne's West End for any sign of forced entry. One theory is that the couple, who graduated two years ago with good degrees, might have known their attacker and let him or her in.</p> <p>Leading the inquiry, Detective Superintendent Steve Wade said Yang had been bludgeoned to death and Zhou hit about the head and suffocated. The couple also had injuries showing they had defended themselves and their attacker would have been covered in blood.</p> <p>\"It was a vicious attack, there was a lot of blood and I think in any interpretation that was something frenzied,\" said Wade. \"We will work around the clock to catch those responsible. We have a very experienced team of detectives working on this case, we have the support of the local community, the area command policing and the people of Newcastle to catch whoever is responsible for this horrendous crime.\"</p> <p>Relatives of Zhou, who was a popular member of staff at the local Wagamama restaurant, have been traced to Hunan in southern China with the help of friends in Britain. She completed her MA in applied linguistics in September 2006, the same time as Yang took an MA in international human resources.</p> <p>They had valid visas, which were due to run out later this year. Wade appealed to the city's Chinese community to come forward if anyone had any idea about reasons for the attack.</p> <p>Pastor Eddy Tang of the International Christian Fellowship in Newcastle, who is helping police liaise with members of the north-east's 10,000-strong Chinese student community, said: \"People are very subdued at the moment.

  "<p>Hind Al-Rubawawi twirls on the dance floor with her groom. Dressed in white, including the obligatory hijab, the 22-year-old university student from Baghdad beams as she gazes at her new husband, Sami Al-Tameemi, and the 50 or 60 guests gathered to celebrate her wedding. Instead of confetti, her new mother-in-law throws sweets, while her young brothers run about with a spray can sending fake snow flakes into the air. It is a joyful occasion, but this wedding, at a dance hall in Damascus, Syria, nearly didn't happen.</p> <p>These days it is almost impossible to have a wedding in Baghdad. Some couples, like Hind and Sami, are choosing to marry abroad at great expense, while others forgo the wedding in favour of perfunctory legal and religious formalities. \"Often fundamentalists come to break up parties and set off bombs, or fight with the military or the family to make instability,\" explains Hind. </p> <p>Before 2003, it was common to have up to 1,000 people at a wedding, and when Hind's parents got married in the 1980s, their guest list numbered well into the hundreds. They had a big party at a hotel in Baghdad with a singer and a band, and went on honeymoon for a week in the Iraqi countryside. Yet for many of Hind's friends, getting married has been a much quieter affair. \"Since the war everyone has been afraid and they've reduced the weddings, so it's only at home, it's not so big, and it's without music because the fundamentalists and military don't allow it,\" she says. \"Some people only go to get the bride from her father's home and take her away without any celebration.\"</p> <p>Another reason why Hind and Sami came to Damascus is that 42-year-old Sami is a refugee, legally resident in Norway. The expense and difficulty of organising a wedding and obtaining visas for both families meant that a Norwegian wedding was impossible, so Damascus was chosen as the next best option to Baghdad. Sami left Iraq in 2006 because, having been a member of the Ba'ath party as a student, the situation had become dangerous. \"I was not in a high position - it was normal within the university,\" Sami says. \"But with the US invasion, they were starting to kill many Ba'athists and were making troubles for me so I decided to leave.\" Sami was accepted as a humanitarian rather than political refugee after al-Qaida seized his father's house and burned his papers.</p> <p>The couple had not met in person until a week before the wedding, but the courtship started seven months ago. In December, Sami told his friend Hashim, Hind's uncle, that he wanted to marry. Hashim played matchmaker by contacting Hind's family and securing permission to pass on her telephone number and email address. The courtship was carried out by phone and on Yahoo! Messenger, with a webcam. Though the couple's first meeting was at the airport in Damascus, both say it was their own decision to marry and that they are very much in love. Once Sami had proposed to Hind, his family paid a visit to her family. On the second occasion they brought her the engagement ring, a gold necklace and another ring as an engagement present. Sami is also expected to provide Hind with \u00a32,600 as security in the event of divorce. \"The internet helps many young couples connect with each other and make a family,\" Sami says. \"It was, of course, my dream to get married in Baghdad, but the particular situation was too difficult to arrange a marriage there, and for me to go to Iraq.\"</p> <p>Marrying in Damascus might be practical for security reasons, but it is an expensive exercise. Hashim, a businessman with interests in Damascus, played an instrumental role in securing passports, visas and car hire, and renting apartments in the Sayedah Zeinab area, 10km from central Damascus, where many Iraqis live.</p> <p>Sami is one of 10 children and his mother, father and three siblings travelled to the wedding from Baghdad, while a fourth came from his home in Vienna. Hind's mother, grandmother and two brothers travelled to the wedding, but her father and another brother and sister remained behind because of the expense. For the Baghdad contingent, costs ran to \u00a3180 each for a passport and visa, \u00a350 each for the businessman's card that the Syrian government require for every visitor, even Hind's 78-year-old grandmother, and \u00a320 each for car hire. Hind's family faced a 14-hour drive from Baghdad to Damascus, but the 10-hour stopover at the border made the journey much longer. </p> <p>When the bride and groom arrived in Damascus, their first step was to be married by a mullah. Since Sami and Hind are practising Shia Muslims, they could not be together in public until they were married, so the mullah came directly to the family home. During the ceremony, as is customary, Hind was asked three times, in private, if she was being forced into the marriage, to which her answer was no. A few days later came the civil wedding in the courts in Damascus. Sami and Hind repeated their vows before the court officials, and Sami and Hashim shook hands - symbolising the contract between both families. Sami then spent the rest of the day getting papers signed and stamped by various officials. </p> <p>Finally it is time for the party. It might not be on the scale of pre-2003 Baghdad weddings, but the number of family and friends present is an indication of how many Iraqis are now living in Damascus. There is a band with a singer - though many people cover their ears to the Arab pop music as the sound system is so loud. There is a western-style cake, which Sami and Hind cut with a sword. The guests drink Fanta - although a few sip beer secretly under the tables so as not to offend the more religious family members - and eat roast chicken, pita, tabbouleh and hummus. Ordinarily in Iraqi culture, there is a breakfast for family the day after the wedding - so they can check the sheets for the signs of blood they believe prove the bride is a virgin. The custom is waived in this case, not because of any modern sensibility, but because it is deemed sensible to preserve Hind's virginity until she has the visa to join Sami in Norway.</p> <p>Hind studies French at Mustansiriya University in Baghdad and only has one more year to go, so the couple have decided that she should finish her studies before she moves to Norway. \"I would like to get married to a woman who has education so I can have a discussion with her,\" Sami says. He is also keen that she study English and Norwegian when she arrives in Norway, so that she can mix with the community. Sami works at a gas company in Molde and he says that while there are a few other Iraqi families there, he has been making an effort to integrate, participating in a government programme that twins refugees with local families, and joining a political party. \"The Norwegians have given me peace and stability and this is what I hope to give to Hind so that she does not sit at home and feel lonely,\" Sami says. \"I love her and she loves me, and everything will be OK. This is most important. But also she should learn the language so we can introduce [her to] the culture and the people and she will feel at home.\" </p> <p>This trip to Damascus has been Hind's first glimpse of life outside Iraq. Living in Baghdad has, she says, become increasingly constrained. \"Now, when the sun sets we should be at home. Before 2003, we could go to the theatre, make excursions. Now it's impossible, it's all closed,\" she says. \"We live in a Shia area so it's not so bad as the mixed areas, which is where they have the most problems, but I still can't go with my friends on the streets.\"</p> <p>Hind is not nervous about her impending move to Norway. \"I think it will be not such a big problem because they have a few Iraqi families there,\" she says. \"My dream is to make a happy family and I will give 100% to fulfil that vision\".</p>",
  "<p>\"I just had no words.\" One rape victim tells today's Guardian of her stunned reaction to an official letter telling her that she had contributed to her own plight by drinking. The slight was eventually reversed, but it was especially painful as it came from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA), a body charged with supporting victims financially. But in this rape case - as in a total of 14 over the last year - a point was made of cutting the funds because the victim had been drinking.</p> <p>The battle to put responsibility for rape where it belongs - squarely with the perpetrator - has been hard fought over the decades. There have been successes. For instance, there are now safeguards against trials descending into a farcical inquiry about why a victim wore a short skirt. And in connection with alcohol, the law was changed to respect the reality that if a woman was in no condition to give consent then she did not give it. But reduced payouts for intoxicated victims could be seen as turning back the clock to the days when misogynistic moralising clouded views about where responsibility for rape belongs.</p> <p>The argument here is not about whether excessive alcohol consumption is a major social problem, which it indisputably is. Nor is there any need to dismiss the fact that drinking raises the risk of suffering rape, just as it increases the dangers of suffering from other violent crimes. No, the argument is that with rape there can be no divvying up of the blame. When a fight ends in injury or death, the question of who threw the first punch can be relevant - and alcohol can make that question harder to settle. With rape, however, there is no equivalent of the first punch: notions of provocation have no place when it comes to sexual violence.</p> <p>When the CICA cuts awards on grounds of drink - as in 1% of rape payouts last year - it clumsily applies broadbrush rules covering a range of crimes. Cuts may be justified when a victim's drinking precipitates certain violent attacks - but rape is not one of them. Reassuringly, the CICA says its general policy is not to cut rape payouts due to alcohol. But even if cuts are only made exceptionally, they still imply that some victims are coauthors of their misfortune.</p> <p>The low conviction rate makes compensation for rape especially important. For the 17 in 18 victims who never see their attacker brought to justice, compensation offers the prospect of formal recognition through another means. That recognition should give the money more than financial value. But the rules on alcohol can leave it providing the opposite of recognition. These rules must change - or at least be applied more sensitively - so that compensation never again compounds injury with insult.</p>",
  "<p>A British construction company has admitted that it may have made corrupt payments to Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq to win an export order. </p> <p>The allegedly improper payments to Saddam's government by Mabey &amp; Johnson, owned by one of Britain's richest families, have been under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office for more than a year. </p> <p>The firm has made a series of disclosures in its recent annual results. Mabey said that in April this year, it \"disclosed to the SFO evidence that had come to light suggesting that in 2002 the company may have indirectly made two payments to the Iraqi regime in breach of UN sanctions\".</p> <p>Mabey also disclosed that it \"has recently been notified of allegations that certain historical contracts may have been procured through corrupt acts\", but did not say how many contracts nor which countries were involved. </p> <p>The company has called in a firm of City lawyers, Herbert Smith, to carry out its own inquiry into all the corruption allegations. New managers have been installed at the firm.</p> <p>In February last year the SFO launched its investigation into the claims that a number of British firms, including Mabey &amp; Johnson, paid bribes to Saddam's government under the United Nations oil-for-food sanctions scheme.</p> <p>The investigation was triggered by an official UN report which had alleged that Saddam's government had abused the sanctions scheme and demanded illicit payments from foreign companies seeking contracts.</p> <p>The report had alleged that Mabey paid a $202,000 (\u00a3101,000) kickback between 2001 and 2003 and was handed a $3.6m contract by the Iraqis.</p> <p>When the investigation started the bridge-building firm said there was no truth in the allegations.</p> <p>The Mabey family has made a fortune - estimated to be more than \u00a3300m - from building and selling steel bridges to 115 countries around the world. Mabey said the allegations had already contributed to a \u00a324m loss last year and warned the company may have to pay a \"significant\" fine if it is found guilty of graft.</p> <p>Mabey said it took the corruption allegations \"very seriously\". \"The company will continue to cooperate voluntarily and fully as appropriate with the SFO.</p> <p>\"The board of the company is committed to the current in-depth review of policies and procedures and the subsequent training to ensure that all employees and international representatives comply fully with the Mabey group code of ethics.\"</p> <p>The investigation by the SFO continues amid persistent criticism that Britain has failed to prosecute any UK firms for making corrupt payments to foreign politicians and officials to win contracts abroad.</p> <p>The Labour government has claimed to be cracking down on corrupt practices since the Blair administration tightened up the law in 2001.</p> <p>Mabey faces further trouble as its former sales director, Jonathan Danos, has alleged in court papers that the company disguised secret payments to middlemen in its sales to Jamaica, the Dominican Republic and Panama to avoid official scrutiny.</p> <p>Danos is in turn being sued by the firm for defrauding Mabey by allegedly skimming off money in the deals for his own use. </p> <p>Both sides deny the accusations. The case is due to be heard next year, although private negotiations to settle the matter have taken place.</p> <p>The firm was founded by Bevil Mabey who had originally started by buying up spare Bailey bridges from the army after the second world war. The Berkshire-based Mabey group of companies has made regular donations to the local Tory party in Wokingham. John Redwood, the Wokingham MP, was chairman of an associated investment company until March.</p> <h2>Backstory</h2> <p>The <strong>oil-for-food scheme</strong> was designed to help the Iraqi people who were suffering the effects of UN sanctions imposed on their country after Saddam invaded Kuwait. It ran from <strong>1996 </strong>until<strong> 2003</strong>. The regime was allowed to choose which foreign firms got the <strong>contracts</strong> to send supplies. In 2005 a UN-funded report by Paul Volcker, former chairman of the US Federal Reserve, alleged that Saddam's regime exploited this loophole. He reported Saddam's regime \"diverted $1.8bn in illicit surcharges\". Volcker said <strong>2,400 companies</strong> from <strong>66 countries</strong> made <strong>irregular</strong> <strong>payments</strong> to the regime.</p>",
  "<p>While the current conflict is mostly a product of Georgian domestic politics and Russian foreign policy, the international community's stance has played its part. Failing to examine local realities, governments and international organisations from the UN downwards have not just encouraged but insisted that Georgia defend a principle of \"territorial integrity\" that is of little practical value in a world where borders are changing all the time. </p> <p>It is of less relevance in a state like Georgia which has never, in real terms, existed within the borders it now claims. Even as a sub-state, Georgian control over Abkhazia and South Ossetia was only really secure between 1934 and 1951 when Lavrenti Beria, best known as Stalin's chief executioner, ran the roost in the South Caucasus. Hence for the Abkhaz and Ossetians, integration into Georgia will never feel anything other than an occupation. The greatest cost of this blind refusal to even allow the idea of secession to be brought to the negotiating table is that it has prevented discussion of, until now, the greatest tragedy arising from the \"frozen conflicts\" - the fate of the thousands of displaced people who are denied the possibility of seeing their homelands again.<br><strong>Dr Jeremy Smith</strong><br>Senior lecturer in Russian history, <br>University of Birmingham</p> <p>Some commentators have compared the catastrophic situation in Georgia and South Ossetia and the actions of Russia with the expansionism of Nazi Germany in the 1930s. This view is misguided and dangerous. The causes of the current conflict are long-term and complex, and have been inflamed by the proposed expansion of Nato and western overtures which have emboldened President Saakashvili to take a gamble that has now terribly backfired. </p> <p>If Georgia had been a Nato member, the consequences for Nato and the world would have been cataclysmic. Russia is often blamed for expansionist interference in neighbours' affairs but in this case can claim some degree of provocation. The failure of the Russian-sponsored UN security council resolution last week because of UK and US opposition to a clause regarding the renunciation of force by both sides was a major destabilising factor, and the proposed new resolution criticising Russia will make the situation even worse. </p> <p>The \"deplorable Russian military aggression\" comment made by the Europe minister demonstrates an ignorance of the strategic principles of warfare, and a worrying willingness to escalate this conflict into a confrontation with Russia, presumably at the behest of the US. Most military commentators view this brinkmanship with despair and there is an urgent requirement for de-escalation. <br><strong>Iain Paton</strong><br>Kirkcaldy, Fife</p> <p>David Clark falls back on stereotypical western views of Russia that ignore the way Russia itself has been bullied in recent times by the US and its allies (The west can no longer stand idle while the Russian bully wreaks havoc, August 11). </p> <p>He makes no reference to any of the attempts to isolate and weaken Russia, which include, for instance, the enlargement of Nato, the tearing up of the anti-ballistic missile treaty, the interference in the elections of its neighbours, the encouragement of Chechen rebels, and the proposed placing of missile defence systems in Poland and the Czech Republic. If Russia is doing some bullying of its own now in Georgia, it has to be seen in response to western policies designed to exclude and enfeeble them.<br><strong>Anthony Kearney</strong><br>Lancaster</p> <p>Considering the EU has not yet accepted Georgia into the EU, is it not highly provocative of the president to be flying the Georgian and EU flags in his office?

  "<p>The Bush administration yesterday announced plans to relax the law protecting endangered species to allow federal agencies to decide for themselves whether construction projects such as highways, dams or mines might harm endangered animals and plants.</p> <p>Under the altered rules, the government would no longer have to consult with independent scientists about the effect of new projects on wildlife. Thousands of consultations take place every year.</p> <p>The US interior secretary, Dirk Kempthorne, said the proposal would help the US use the species law \"more efficiently and avoid misusing it to regulate global climate change\". He added: \"It is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impact affecting species.\" </p> <p>Environmental campaigners condemned the planned changes as a \"sneak attack\" on species protections that have existed since 1973. John Kostyack, executive director of conservation at the National Wildlife Federation, said: \"These changes take unbiased, professional wildlife biologists out of the equation and put decisions in the hands of political appointees.\"</p> <p>Kempthorne defended the proposal as an effort to clear up \"confusion\" and prevent \"unnecessary\" wildlife protection work. In a draft version of the plan leaked to the media, his department claimed US government agencies would \"err on the side of caution\" when performing their internal environmental reviews.</p> <p>The Bush administration is not required to consult with Congress before approving the changes, even though a similar proposal died in Congress three years ago.</p> <p>The senior Democrat on the Senate environment committee, Barbara Boxer, said the species plan amounted to an illegal \"back door\" repeal of environmental law. \"If this proposed regulation had been in place, it would have undermined our ability to protect the bald eagle, the grizzly bear and the grey whale,\" she said.</p>",
  "<p>The cultural fissure faced by pupils of Capital City academy of Brent on their visit to Oxford's St John's College is vividly and convincingly evoked by Polly Toynbee and David Walker (Education Guardian, August 5). I am only sorry for the lack of discussion about what the authors think Oxford University should be doing to level the playing field for applicants from such disadvantaged backgrounds. </p> <p>I think we are right to insist that our primary role in society is to maintain the teaching and research excellence that places us in the forefront of universities worldwide. </p> <p>Nevertheless, as an admissions tutor I am perfectly aware that something is amiss in the huge imbalance between the proportion of students admitted to Oxford from the private schools and the proportion of the school population so educated (though, as it happens, St John's College takes almost 70% of its students from the state sector, about the highest of all the Oxford colleges and well above the university average). </p> <p>The simple starting fact is that Oxford wants the brightest, most academically committed kids as its undergraduates. It is completely immaterial to us what gender, colour or nationality they are, or what their family background, sexual orientation or anything else is. But how are we to find those with the highest academic potential? It is common knowledge that whatever criteria we apply - number of GCSEs, aptitude test scores, examples of written work, interview performance - the independent and the selective state schools in affluent areas of Britain have the resources and parental support to prepare their pupils to perform better. But it means, inevitably, that our task of distinguishing true if raw talent and academic potential from mere excellence of education is a great deal more difficult than usually appreciated.</p> <p>I can see only three solutions. Oxford could wait until the standard of state education in all schools reaches that of the well-funded, fee-paying independents and the selective grammar schools. What a long wait that would be. </p> <p>Or we could have quotas imposed on us - a legally (or more likely financially) binding limit of, say, 5% intake from independent schools and so on. </p> <p>The third possibility is to engage in positive discrimination in favour of candidates from disadvantaged backgrounds. To a degree, this describes what we actually do. I know of no subject tutor in my college, or in my subject university-wide, who would not give the benefit of the doubt to an applicant from an under-privileged background who appeared to have a spark that belied their modest achievements to date. </p> <p>More than that, we always take into consideration any special circumstances the school cares to tell us about. We also have available the average scores of an individual school's exam results, which has a direct bearing on what to make of the number of A* GCSEs and A-level predictions of a specific candidate. Given all such information we consider, and given the huge effort put into admissions (up to four interviews to about four times the number of candidates than places available), no one can reasonably accuse us of not working towards being fair to all, even if we have a good way to go.</p> <p>I would have been happier if Toynbee and Walker had been more positive about the extent to which Oxford is trying to overcome the greatest barrier: persuading students from underprivileged backgrounds that getting into Oxford needn't \"be like climbing Everest without oxygen or crampons\". Participation in AimHigher and other such schemes, open days, and the visits to schools by admissions staff are serious attempts to reach out to those who do not think that Oxford could ever be for the likes of them. Indeed, the university and the colleges collectively spend about \u00a32m a year on the effort. </p> <p>Oh yes, and another myth to explode. Studying at Oxford actually need cost no more than at a London \"rust-stained, concrete former polytechnic\".

  "<p>Water companies in England and Wales want bills to go up by about \u00a330 plus inflation over five years from 2010 to pay for renewing ageing infrastructure, developing new supplies and tackling the effects of climate change.</p> <p>Water UK, which represents water and waste water companies, said the increases amounted to an average of \u00a36 a year, which would take the average bill to \u00a3350 by 2015. The actual bills are likely to be higher because Water UK's calculations are based on 2007-08 prices and do not include the effect of inflation.</p> <p>Although the new price regime will not be decided until next November by the industry regulator, Ofwat, and will not come into effect until 2010, the process is taking place against a background of sharp rises in household energy bills.</p> <p>Water UK said its figures covered a wide range of increases, from an average of less than \u00a32 a year to \u00a315. Southern Water wants to increase prices by an average of 4.5% a year above inflation to pay for \u00a32.6bn of investment.

  "<p>It was only a matter of time before the ubiquity of Gap was eclipsed by another label. Gap, as every fashionista knows, is for basics. The stores have improved their fashion credentials in recent years by collaborating with Roland Mouret and Pierre Hardy, but Gap has always been slow to respond to trends. The retailer has had a more fashion-forward European design team for only a few years. It responded to the recent economic downturn by axing it again. At heart, you still feel its designers are the masters of the simple white T-shirt and black trousers.</p> <p>Zara by contrast has pulled off the difficult trick of making fast fashion look like high fashion. Designs combine sharp tailoring - even a basic jacket will have a nipped in waist and sexy cut - with feminine details and pretty prints. Dress in Gap and you'll blend in; dress in Zara and you're likely to get a compliment and a question: \"Where's that from?\"</p> <p>Detractors claim Zara rips off designers. Which high street store doesn't? What Zara is brilliant at is turning out designs with a Marni-esque or Prada-lite look without directly copying. </p> <p>When Zara opened in England, it was the first fashion chain to constantly restock. That has become commonplace but then it was a brilliant new strategy: luring customers back weekly by offering something different on every visit. The chain has also broken from the fashion pack over collaborations. Where Mango, Topshop and Gap have scrabbled to sign up Kate Moss or Penelope Cruz, Zara has maintained a dignified silence. Somehow this makes it seem rather grown-up in a world of teenage celebrity-gawking: Zara is for women who want to dress for themselves, not as a clone.</p> <p>It's frequently claimed Zara can get a new item into stores in just two weeks. Unusually, it makes more than half its clothes at home, in Spain. Keeping a tight control of the supply chain means it can get 10,000 new designs a year out in record time. It also operates a zero tolerance policy on styles: if it doesn't sell within a week, it's withdrawn.</p> <p>Uniquely for a mainstream fashion retailer, Zara spends very little on advertising. This is a fascinating strategy - it prefers customers to discover it in store rather than in magazines. Indeed there are stores on some of the world's most exclusive shopping streets - Fifth Avenue in New York, Via Condotti in Rome and the Champs-Elys\u00e9es in Paris. But it is risky: fashion magazines run on advertising, and if you don't advertise, you can't guarantee the editors will be cooing over your latest frocks. All the more impressive, therefore, that they frequently do.</p>",
  "<p>The former Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra skipped bail yesterday and fled to exile in Britain, claiming he could not expect a fair trial on corruption charges because of political interference.</p> <p>Thaksin and his wife, Pojaman, who was sentenced to three years in prison two weeks ago for fraud, said they flew to Britain because they had received \"death threats\" in Thailand. </p> <p>Rumours were rife that the couple would flee after Pojaman, 51, was convicted of evading millions of pounds in taxes in connection with a 1997 shares transfer deal.

What happened to my family is like fruit from a poisonous tree - the fruit will also be poisoned. </p> <p>\"There is a continuation of dictatorship managing Thai politics ... which is followed by interference in the justice system. These are my political enemies. </p> <p>They do not care about the rule of law, facts or internationally recognised due process,\" he added. Thaksin lived in exile in Britain for two years after he was ousted in a 2006 military coup. He returned to Thailand this year to face corruption charges against him after his political allies won new elections and formed a coalition government. </p> <p>But just five months after returning to a hero's welcome, Thaksin railed against the Thai judicial system that he said was stacked against him, despite his allies in the People Power party winning the election in December.</p> <p>The swift action against the pair yesterday suggested that almost \u00a31bn of Thaksin's assets frozen in Thai bank accounts could be at risk, though he is believed to have significant funds salted away in banks outside the country.</p> <p>Chris Baker, Thaksin's biographer and a political analyst, said of the statement: \"Clearly Thaksin is very angry by the way things have turned out. He is obviously extremely emotional. There's a fighting tone; he's not given up completely.\"</p> <p>But after Pojaman's conviction Baker said the writing was on the wall for the former leader. He said Thaksin did not want to take any chances with the verdict of a corruption case about an allegedly dubious land deal, due in September, because the verdict, for which there would be no appeal, would be decided by the supreme court.</p> <p>The arrival in London of the telecoms tycoon could present the British government with a diplomatic dilemma. Thailand has had an extradition agreement with the UK since a 1911 bilateral treaty. </p> <p>The Thai authorities could apply to have their former prime minister extradited, although it would be a lengthy procedure and one which Thaksin would resist on the grounds that the judiciary were allegedly leading a witch-hunt against him. </p> <p>The legal proceedings also raised questions about the tycoon's ownership of Manchester City football club and what effect his departure may have on his financing of it. </p> <p>Thaksin bought Manchester City for \u00a381.6m during his 17-month exile in the UK. It is thought that the Premier League must now ascertain whether he remains a \"fit and proper person\" to run the club. </p> <p>Fans have also questioned whether the tycoon's latest move and the freezing of his assets could put in jeopardy the funds he had hoped to make available for the purchase of new players. </p> <p>The club, which kicks off its premiership season this weekend, declined to comment on Thaksin's status yesterday.</p> <h2>Backstory</h2> <p><strong>Thaksin Shinawatra</strong>, 59, a former policeman from Chiang Mai who made a <strong>fortune in telecoms</strong>, was the first Thai prime minister to win two terms of office. He went into politics in 1994, becoming foreign minister, and then founded the <strong>Thai Rak Thai</strong> party in 1998. He became premier in 2001 backed by the rural poor but soon faced allegations of <strong>authoritarianism</strong> and <strong>corruption</strong>. He was <strong>ousted</strong> by the army in a bloodless <strong>coup</strong> in 2006. After refusing to face trial, he sought <strong>exile</strong> in Britain and bought <strong>Manchester City </strong>football club. Vowing to clear his name, he returned to Thailand but fled after his wife was sentenced for <strong>tax evasion</strong>.</p>",
  "<p>A young footballer, touted as one of the brightest prospects in the English game, was awarded a record \u00a34.3m compensation package yesterday after an \"over the top\" tackle left his career in ruins.</p> <p>Ben Collett, now 23, joined Manchester United at the age of nine and was described by the club's manager Sir Alex Ferguson as an outstanding prospect.</p> <p>But during his first game for the reserves Collett, a left-footed player who had been compared to Ryan Giggs, had his leg broken in two places when he was tackled by Middlesbrough's Gary Smith. He was awarded \u00a34.3m in damages at the high court in London yesterday - a record according to his lawyers - including \u00a33,854,328 for predicted loss of earnings.</p> <p>\"The size of the award made by the court today reflects his talent and potential prior to the tackle as one of the brightest young footballers in the country,\" said Collet's lawyer, Jan Levinson. \"Having said that, Ben would understandably have preferred to earn this sum through a full career as a professional footballer.\" </p> <p>Collett had been part of the Manchester United youth team that won the FA Youth Cup in 2003 and Ferguson said he had the qualities to become a household name before he was injured.</p> <p>\"I thought the boy showed fantastic focus, a great attitude to hard work, and they are qualities to give any player an outstanding chance in the game,\" Ferguson told an earlier hearing.</p> <p>United legend Paddy Crerand said the youngster had a similar style to Ryan Giggs, and Brian McClair, manager of the club's youth academy, said Collet's intelligence made him a \"student of football\" with an exceptional ability to think fast and read the game. </p> <p>\"During his 11 years at Manchester United he had impressed players and staff at all levels from Sir Alex Ferguson and Gary Neville to the contemporaries who played alongside him,\" Mrs Justice Swift said. </p> <p>Collett was talent-spotted by United Scouts as nine-year-old and made his way through the club's youth programme. In January 2001 he was offered a two-year scholarship and promised a one-year professional contract when he turned 18.</p> <p>He played a central role in the club's victory in the FA Youth Cup and was named the young player of the year. But only days later, during his first appearance for the reserves, Collett broke his leg in two places, effectively ending his career.</p> <p>The judge told the court: \"The tackle was high and 'over the ball' and, as a consequence, the claimant suffered a fracture of the tibia and fibula of his right leg.\"</p> <p>Middlesbrough FC and Smith both admitted liability through their insurers for the negligent tackle.</p> <p>In the months that followed the incident Collett underwent physiotherapy in an attempt to resurrect his career. He managed to return to training in January 2004 but, despite continuing to play for the club's Under-19 and reserve teams, the court heard he \"never regained his pre-injury standard of play\" and was eventually forced into early retirement.</p> <p>Yesterday the court heard that Collett is due to start an English degree at the University of Leeds next September and now hopes to pursue a career in law, journalism or academia.</p> <p>Swift said he had studied hard during his time at the youth academy and had shown the same determination in his academic work as he had in his football.</p> <p>\"[His] positive attitude towards his injury and to the devastating blow of being unable to pursue his chosen career does him great credit,\" she told the court. \"He was plainly intelligent and it is clear that he has brought - and will in the future bring - to his academic studies the same dedication and commitment that he formerly applied to football.\" </p> <p>She added that Collett had been described by one of his tutors as \"the most remarkable student I have had the pleasure to teach\".</p> <p>Yesterday's award of \u00a34.3m is expected to rise to more than \u00a34.5m when future loss of pension and interest on past loss of earnings are calculated at a hearing due to take place in October.</p>",
  "<p>We are fast approaching perhaps the most panic stricken day in the educational year, A-level results day (although in Scotland August 5 was the day). Outsiders could be forgiven for getting the impression that all higher education applications activity occurs at this time, when in truth most of the hard work has been done well beforehand. So, what actually happens on Thursday and over the following days?</p> <p>First, a fact that always shocks students: your chosen universities receive your results days before you do. This means that by August 14, they have usually decided whether to confirm their offers. What that has also meant, over the past few years as the online world has developed, is that you can find out their decisions before you get your results. Logging on via the track progress button on the Ucas website from early Thursday morning may furnish you with the information you desire. Staff in schools and colleges will be confronted by beaming students before they collect their result slips! Remember that if either your firm or insurance choices confirm their offer, that is where you are going to go, you cannot look elsewhere - in Ucas speak you entered a \"serious contractual agreement\". Release is only possible in exceptional circumstances. </p> <p>On the other hand, the information may not be what you wanted; both your choices have turned you down because you didn't meet their requirements. You are now eligible for clearing.</p> <p>What exactly is clearing? Put simply, it's a system for all those applicants yet to secure a place. These will include those whose grades were not high enough, those who declined their original offers, plus late applicants. Around 30,000 students gain places through clearing each year. Read the panel on the right for a list of things to do when going into Clearing.</p> <p>Some basic matters underpin the points:</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Although Clearing lasts into September, most of the action is in the first few days after the publication of A-level results.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> You need to be prepared and available - if this is being read in some inaccessible part of the world, you're in trouble!</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Although it is a burst of activity, it doesn't pay to rush and panic - research carefully; take time to do this and get advice.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Much as it will be helpful having parents and advisers on hand, it is you who is going to be spending three or more years, possibly in a new place, doing the course: make your own calls and decisions.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> If you want to make a last-minute application, you can do this until September 20. You'll go straight into Clearing.</p> <p>This is often a cathartic time, where rapid, instinctive decisions may not be best. A break from education for a year or more may be the best option - a gap year can involve work, travel, more study, sometimes a mix of these. Or a different type of course and mode of study may suit you, for example, a foundation degree, which mixes study and work, or studying part- rather than full time.</p> <p>For the successful ones, Ucas will write to confirm your place. Once you receive this letter, you can prepare for new and exciting times ahead.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> John Beckett is a higher education adviser at City and Islington Sixth Form College </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.Guardian.co.uk/education/clearing\">Guardian.co.uk/education/clearing</a></p> <h2>What to do on results day</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> First, check (by phone) that neither of your initial two choices will change their decision, especially if your grades were close. Enlist the support of an adviser. If there were extenuating circumstances, they may be able to intervene on your behalf.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Next, think carefully about the subjects you want to look for in Clearing. Two things to remember: you can look for different courses to your original ones (those choices were made a long time ago), and it pays to be flexible and open-minded. Not all universities or courses will have vacancies. You'll find lists of places and spaces both online and in the printed media.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Next, you (not anyone else) should contact some universities - by phone is best; if it's close, face to face is even better. You'll be asking about the course content and entry requirements. You'll be asked about your grades.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Now take time out to ponder. If you've been made an offer, consider it carefully before making a decision. Why not visit? Ask for some time to decide.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> You can contact as many universities as you want to. You may even try a uni you were rejected by last autumn.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Don't commit yourself until you are sure. Only send off your Clearing passport, sent to you by Ucas, once you're certain the course is for you, as this will commit you to that option. If in any doubt, seek professional advice, there's plenty on offer at this time.</p>",
  "<p>It was still not clear last night where, and when, Russia's \"peacekeeping mission\" - its counterattack into Georgia - would stop. The Georgian capital, Tbilisi, was rife last night with rumours that the Russians were coming. Kakha Lomaia, the secretary of Georgia's national security council, claimed Russian forces had captured Gori, a strategic town beyond the breakaway state of South Ossetia and within striking distance of Tbilisi. The Russian defence ministry denied its troops were in the town and there was no independent evidence of the town's seizure. But there was no dispute about the Russian armoured presence in Senaki, which lies outside the security zone along the boundary with the breakaway province of Abkhazia. The Russians said Senaki was occupied to stop Georgian forces regrouping and launching new attacks on South Ossetia.</p> <p>There were two opposing narratives afoot. The Georgian president, Mikheil Saakashvili, claimed all day that the real Russian purpose was to depose him, and with him an independent, democratic Georgia. South Ossetia was just a sideshow. This crisis was not about separatist movements in Georgia, but about democracy itself, he claimed. Russian leaders, visibly angered by Ossetian accounts of Georgian atrocities, said that genocide had been attempted in South Ossetia's capital, Tskhinvali. Russia insisted that the purpose of its bombardments far from the conflict zone was to secure the peace of civilians whom it was now their moral duty to protect. One of the only things we can be absolutely sure of is that neither side is telling the whole truth.</p> <p>There is undoubtedly a strong punitive streak to Russian bombing and shelling 24 hours after Georgian forces tried to disengage, particularly in Gori, the town from which the Georgians launched their military misadventure last week. As we report today, Russian bombers were targeting civilian blocks of flats three kilometres from a tank base. The bombers returned to their civilian targets three days in a row. With Georgian air defences knocked out , and Russian jets free to roam around Georgia's airspace, the aim of Russian strikes is to scare the living daylights out of citizens of an independent state. It is to remind them who is the real military power in the region. Not Washington, or Nato headquarters in Brussels, but Moscow.</p> <p>But it would be a major strategic blunder for Russian tanks to rumble on into Tbilisi, because this would force international action. The case for a Russian intervention on sovereign Georgian territory, which South Ossetia still is, rests on the grounds that Ossetian civilians were being slaughtered by the Georgians. They say 1,600 civilians died in the Georgian shelling, including 15 Russian soldiers. If the real purpose of a Russian intervention is regime change - and there were military voices yesterday saying Russia should go \"all the way\" - it would dramatically widen the contours of the crisis. This would be Hungary in 1956 or Czechoslovakia in 1968, and Georgia's hyperventilating leaders would have been proved right. Moscow is unlikely to hand Mr Saakashvili that satisfaction. Russian officials said they had no intention of overthrowing the Georgian president. </p> <p>The Russians concentrated on claims of atrocities by Georgian soldiers when they took control of South Ossetia. They claimed women were herded into houses which were then burned down, people were crushed with tanks, prisoners had their throats slit, grenades were thrown into bomb shelters. Russian soldiers are no strangers to war crimes. They did similar things to Chechens each time they recaptured Grozny. But if Russia substantiates its claims, it should make those who support the Georgian leader pause for thought. If Russian tanks stop at the borders of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, the verdict of history will hinge on what happened in Tskhinvali last week.</p>",
  "<p>Not long ago, further education ministers and their officials enjoyed playing Cupid, encouraging colleges to hitch up.</p> <p>There were 465 colleges when the further education sector was freed from local authority control in 1993. By last January, that number had tumbled to 373, mostly through mergers. But now, suddenly, chastity is the message blowing from the Department for Innovation Universities and Skills (Dius). </p> <p>\"We do not believe that there is any well-founded evidence in support of large colleges generally,\" says the latest document the department has issued on the future of colleges. </p> <p>\"Indeed, we are concerned that, in some cases, mergers may actually be detrimental to the interests of learners, employers and communities in terms of reducing choice, and potentially undermining local ownership and accountability.\"</p> <p><strong>Model of success</strong></p> <p>Ofsted has suggested a different tale. As Dius was issuing Further Education Colleges - Models for Success, the inspectorate published a dazzling verdict on a college recently involved in a remarkable merger.</p> <p>Last year, Newcastle College's takeover of Skelmersdale and Ormskirk College had been by far the boldest to date and had attracted flak. FE marriage is usually with the boy or girl next door; 160 miles separated this pair.</p> <p>The Newcastle College Group was judged outstanding throughout, and inspectors dwelled on the impressively managed merger with Skelmersdale and Orsmskirk. </p> <p>The college jubilantly proclaimed itself \"the top performing FE college in the UK, after receiving the best results in Ofsted's history\".</p> <p>Though the 28-page Dius document expounds on other government ambitions for the further education system, it is the marked change of heart about merger that leaps off many of the pages.</p> <p>\"Colleges and other providers are autonomous bodies and there is no intention to specify or impose any particular model of organisation...,\" it says, while doing what some people might think to be just that.</p> <p>It cites a Dius study of the evidence about college size and mergers, which finds \"no evidence of a relationship between college size and success rates\". It does, however, acknowledge that a correlation between size and success has been apparently found in Wales. </p> <p>Promise and Performance, an independent review of Welsh further education published in December, concluded that size did matter.</p> <p>\"Larger units are more flexible for so many different purposes: curriculum, timetabling, employer support,\" it said. It estimated that to be fully effective, colleges needed turnovers of at least \u00a315m.</p> <p>The Dius study also accepts evidence of a modest relationship between college size and Ofsted inspection grades in that a larger proportion of larger colleges perform well.</p> <p>It adds, however, that \"larger colleges do not necessarily perform well, and colleges of any size can perform well\".</p> <p>The evidence in question was in a report - By Accident or Design - compiled by Adrian Perry and Mick Fletcher for the CfBT education trust two months ago. This found that a \u00a335m college scores on average half a grade better in Ofsted inspections than a \u00a35m college.</p> <p>\"'Half a grade point' sounds a small variance, but it isn't,\" the report notes. \"Given that no inspection grade can be lower than 1, or higher than 4, the range in play is three points - and so half a grade point is a 17% better result.\"</p> <p>Further Education Colleges - Models for Success, sets out tighter criteria for future mergers. \"We will expect to see robust evidence that all other options have been considered ... proposals ... will be subject to a high level of scrutiny and challenge\".</p> <p>John Denham, the innovation, universities and skills secretary, has meanwhile asked Salford, Eccles and Pendleton colleges to revise their merger proposal.</p> <p>Jackie Fisher, Newcastle College's principal and chief executive, accepts that merger per se does not guarantee improvement. That demands good leadership and management, she says.</p> <p><strong>Safety net</strong></p> <p>She believes that the government's determination to create a competitive market for post-19 further education and the dominance of its Train to Gain programme necessitates smaller colleges - particularly those more reliant on their adult operations - to bulk up through merger in order to survive.</p> <p>\"How will government deal with a small college that loses a couple of contracts in the free market for adult funding?\" she asks. \"Either that college would have to merge or receive a public subsidy.\"</p> <p>Warwickshire College has been through three mergers. Each time it was invited to take over an institution with problems, says its principal, Ioan Morgan, former chair of the 157 Group of largest colleges.</p> <p>His governing body - which includes \"some pretty high-powered business people\" - believes the college is not big enough and needs to double its budget from \u00a352m to \u00a3100m to feel secure in the 19-plus market.</p> <p>\"Before the demise of the Carter &amp; Carter group the government could be gung ho and say: 'If colleges can't cope, the private sector will',\" he says.</p> <p>\"But now government needs to be more careful. It listened to business, now it has to listen to colleges.\"</p> <p>Denham flagged up the change in attitude to mergers in his speech to the Association of Colleges' annual conference in November.</p> <p>\"He is very focused on local provision,\" says Morgan. \"He's saying that when you get a super-college you lose that localness.\"</p> <p>But there are many in further education management who suspect there is more to the policy change than that. Something else, they reckon, explains the document's enthusiasm for colleges to collaborate but not to amalgamate.</p> <p>\"I suspect the reason that they are against college mergers is the reason that some colleges are in favour of them,\" says Mick Fletcher. \"Colleges want to get into a strong position, but the department wants a lot of weaker providers fighting like rats in a sack.\"</p>",
  "<p>President Evo Morales is to push for a new constitution to transform Bolivia and increase the power of its indigenous majority after his sweeping victory in Sunday's recall referendum.</p> <p>The radical reformer, a former coca farmer, hopes the landslide will revive his stalled effort to \"refound\" South America's poorest country as a socialist state to benefit the long-neglected indigenous masses in the western highlands. More than 63% of voters ratified the mandate of Morales and his vice-president, Alvaro Garc\u00eda, according to partial unofficial results .</p> <p>The new constitution, if approved, would extend the powers of the central government and allow Morales to run for a second consecutive term in the deeply divided nation.</p> <p>\"What happened today is important, not only for Bolivians but for all Latin Americans,\" Morales told a cheering crowd from the balcony of the presidential palace in La Paz. \"I dedicate this victory to all the revolutionaries in the world.\" </p> <p>However, fierce opposition in Bolivia's relatively prosperous eastern lowlands has stymied much of his ambitious agenda, provoking turmoil and political violence. </p> <p>Eight provincial governors were also subject to recall and two opposition figures were among the three governors who were ousted. But the most powerful opposition governors in Santa Cruz and neighbouring provinces entrenched their positions and declared a fresh mandate to resist what they portrayed as a budding socialist tyranny. </p> <p>Land reform and control of natural gas revenues compound the racially tinged power struggle between La Paz and the restive provinces.</p> <p>In a combative address, Rub\u00e9n Costas, the governor of Santa Cruz, advocated more regional autonomy and rejected a new constitution. Another opposition governor, Manfred Reyes Villa, the prefect of Cochabamba, lost the vote but said he would ignore it because it was illegal.</p>",
  "<p>A growing number of British visitors to Spain and France are adding a brush with the law to the hours spent bronzing on the costas or mooching along Parisian boulevards, figures released today by the Foreign Office suggest.</p> <p>The FCO statistics show that 2,032 British nationals were arrested in Spain last year - 32% more than the previous year - and more than in any other foreign country. France saw a 42% rise in detained Britons, though the total was lower at 152.</p> <p>Britons on foreign trips were also particularly likely to fall foul of the authorities in Cyprus, the US and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), according to the figures. </p> <p>The British tendency towards inebriation appears to have played its part, with the FCO attributing many of the arrests to \"behaviour caused by excessive drinking\". But the higher-than-average number of arrests in the UAE is also explained by the emirates' zero-tolerance drugs policy - which affected Britons travelling through the UAE en route to other destinations - and its strict public decency laws.</p> <p>The figures cover the period April 2006 to March 2007 and show that there were 29 recorded rapes of Britons in Spain, compared with 28 in Greece and 21 in Turkey.</p> <p>Nearly 700 Britons needed hospital treatment in Spain, while 1,591 died there. In France there were 385 British deaths, while the figure in Germany was 294.</p> <p>In terms of deaths per visitor, Thailand had the highest proportion of fatalities at 269. The figures also suggest that Thailand is, proportionally, the country in which Britons are most likely to end up in hospital, mainly as a result of motorbike accidents, said the FCO. </p> <p>Visitors to Spain lost the most passports (6,710), followed by those to the US (2,792). The highest number of instances of Britons needing consular assistance was recorded by diplomatic staff in the US (8,304), followed by Spain (7,590).</p>",

  "<p>Cash-strapped American states have been accused of replenishing their coffers by pouncing on unused bank accounts, share certificates and travellers' cheques.</p> <p>Under US law, public authorities can seize funds if they are left untouched for a certain period. Several states have cut this waiting period in order to get their hands on potentially lucrative assets more quickly. An estimated $5.2bn (\u00a32.6bn) in unclaimed assets went to US state governments in 2006 - an increase of a third on 2003, according to figures by USA Today. </p> <p>Michael Fitzgerald, Iowa's state treasurer, said most states made every effort to return property to its owners but others were less diligent. \"There are a few states that try to increase revenue this way and they give us all a bad name,\" he said.</p> <p>States including Washington, Alabama and Oregon have changed their regulations so that they can seize abandoned property within three years, instead of five years. Most states advertise unclaimed property in newspapers in an effort to trace the owners - though California recently stopped doing this.</p> <p>Other forms of unclaimed property include cheques from insurance companies, often thrown away as junk mail, and dividend payouts to shareholders.</p> <p>Fitzgerald said financial lost property was on the increase, partly because people are moving more often: \"We're a very mobile society. Evert time you move, mail goes astray.\"</p> <p>According to the Centre on Budget and Policy Priorities, a Washington-based think-tank, 29 US states face budgetary shortfalls totalling $48bn this year. </p> <p>The sub-prime mortgage crisis and the ensuing downturn in US house prices has caused property tax takes to drop. Sales tax on furniture, appliances and construction materials has been similarly weak. </p> <p>The biggest budget gaps, according to the think-tank, are in areas where the housing slump has been most acute - such as Nevada, California and Arizona.</p> <p>Local governments are also facing a surge in the cost of fuel. One district in Seattle has cut back on school buses. In part of Ohio, sheriffs' deputies have been told to use golf buggies instead of cars. The National Conference of State Legislatures described states' tax revenue as \"anaemic\" and their financial positions as \"worse than expected\". The few exceptions are Alaska and North Dakota, which are benefiting from higher minerals prices.</p>",
  "<p>Talks to end Zimbabwe's political crisis were bogged down yesterday as Morgan Tsvangirai resisted intense pressure to agree to Robert Mugabe retaining much of his power. </p> <p>A second day of gruelling negotiations broke up last night without agreement and Mugabe gave a downbeat assessment, saying they were not making progress at present but that he hoped differences \"will be overcome\" when the talks resume today. </p> <p>Opposition officials say Mugabe has made few real concessions and has rejected Tsvangirai's claim to be the country's legitimate leader because he won the last credible election, held in March. </p> <p>Tsvangirai agreed to Mugabe remaining in office as a ceremonial president but demanded that political power be shifted to him as an executive prime minister at the head of a coalition cabinet. But the opposition said Mugabe had demanded that the prime minister remain subordinate to the president.</p> <p>\"Zanu-PF is not talking about conceding any real power. They are talking about giving up positions in cabinet but they want to remain in control. These guys aren't serious,\" the opposition official said. </p> <p>\"The differences revolve around who will have power. They're not giving up anything on that. They entered these negotiations solely to give up cosmetic issues.\"</p> <p>A spokesman for the opposition said Tsvangirai came under pressure from South Africa's president, Thabo Mbeki, who is acting as mediator, to allow Mugabe to keep some degree of real power. But the spokesman said the MDC leader argued that would be a betrayal of the voters.</p> <p>\"There is a lot of pressure on Tsvangirai ... People in the party are telling him that he cannot agree to a deal that does not recognise the people's will and democracy. Mugabe ... should not be allowed to keep power just because he terrorised the population into voting for him. </p> <p>\"The pressure for us is coming from the people. They don't want to see some kind of half-hearted change. If we were to do that we would lose credibility. If Morgan takes something cosmetic from Zanu-PF he will lose the support of the Zimbabwean people.\"</p> <p>Hours earlier Mugabe described the talks as \"raising the prospect for an all-inclusive government\" and said only minor obstacles remained to an agreement. He told the annual commemoration to mark the country's liberation war yesterday that Zimbabwe \"is not for sale\" and warned the opposition not to be \"used by enemies\" - usually meant to refer to Britain, which he has accused of destroying Zimbabwe's economy as a punishment for redistributing white-owned farms.</p>",
  "<p>Lying toward the east of Beijing in the Chaoyang district, the Workers Stadium was one of the Ten Great Buildings commissioned in 1959 to mark the 10th anniversary of the People's Republic of China. These are somewhat different times, though, and so it is that a new face in town has parked itself right across the street. As this establishment's waitresses shriek in unison at arriving customers: \"Welcome to Hooters Beijing!\" Behold the new face of Chinese capitalism. And please try to stay looking at its face. </p> <p>Whilst other bars in the area were ordered to close for the Olympics by the state authorities, Hooters was never under threat, being one of Beijing's relatively tiny amount of sports bars, and a source of faintly misplaced early-capitalist pride. Following successful openings in Shanghai and Hangzhou, the Atlanta-based chain last year rolled out its nuanced vision of post-feminism-with-buffalo-sauce to Beijing, and the busy new branch is pushing itself as the perfect place to keep your eye on several events at once, on the many screens garlanded with Olympic and Chinese flags. \"Can you keep it on the beach volleyball?\" demands an American concerned at moves to switch channels on his nearest portal into the Corinthian contest playing out at venues across the city.</p> <p>Clientele is 50% foreign, 50% Chinese, says Rachel. Rachel will be your server today - she calls herself Rachel in keeping with the Chinese practice of adopting a Western name they like or which sounds most like their real one - and she's wearing Hooters' international uniform of tight white vest and exceedingly short orange shorts. </p> <p>She recently graduated from university in the city, and confirms this is a almost exclusively a graduate job, partly because of the requirement for decent English, but mainly because of the pay. Hooters waiting staff can expect to be paid 1400-1800 RMB (\u00a3106-\u00a3137) a month, plus tips. The restaurant's turnover is up to 900,000 RMB (\u00a368,000) a month, according to manager Alfie, who says pointedly that he does not encourage his staff to bring their families to the restaurant. </p> <p>Hooters not translating as a pun in Mandarin, Rachel is unaware that the word emblazoned across her vest refers to something other than the owl that goggles away in its logo, as she takes orders beneath a large sign reading \"Caution: blondes thinking\". Unsurprisingly, given it is entirely staffed by local Chinese women, there are no blondes, but the Hooters approach would appear to be: why tamper one iota with a winning formula? Almost every other globalised brand that has made incursions into China has adapted itself to some degree, with McDonalds' menus reflecting regional tastes, for example, whilst IKEA produces Chinese-influenced furniture designs. At Hooters, not so much as a buffalo duck wing corrupts that sacred template, and the Guardian's Chinese translator confirmed the sight of Beijinger waitresses dancing provocatively to Hey Mickey jarred markedly with Beijing's still-conservative culture.</p> <p>Frankly, watching them giggle slightly self-consciously through the choreographed routines, one senses that even were Hooters to roll out its franchise to the Vatican City, it would demand zero deviation from its global standard, for all the likely shortage of suitable applicants.</p> <p>Shanghai is far more progressive and westernised than the capital, landing it the honour of China's first Hooters four years ago, but in Beijing the idea that sex sells is still in its very early days. Hang around long enough in Hooters Beijing, though, and you are left with the impression that the sports stuff is just there to sweeten the pill - Hooters is actually pioneering an approach that, all things being well, will lead to the utopian state already achieved in the west, where you can barely buy an overpriced broadband package without the mirage-like promise of a bunk-up.</p> <p>The US-based website The Smoking Gun recently published Hooters' employment guidelines, which state: \"The Hooters concept is based on female sex appeal and the work environment is one in which joking and sexual innuendo based on female sex appeal is commonplace\". Do they follow that code to the letter here in Beijing? Official guidelines merely stress applicants must be \"cheerful in a lively way and like the sports\".</p> <p>Management stresses all applicants are required to have a good knowledge of local sports - especially Olympics at this time - on which they are examined before being given the job. They must also \"create joyfully the lively dining room atmosphere\".</p> <p>\"I like Hooters. It's very happy. It's enthusiastic and energetic. I love Hooters,\" runs a typically on-message verdict from a Beijing branch waitress - a reminder that Hooters women across the world love their jobs, and the guys they get to serve. Yet the banner near the restaurant entrance reads \"Hooters Beijing loves the Olympics!' and that one feels even easier to buy into.</p>",
  "<p>Two of Sir Clive Woodward's closest associates are on a plane to Beijing but the British Olympic Association will not foot the bill. Woodward, the BOA's \u00a3300,000-a-year director of elite sport, is flying Dave Reddin, formerly the England rugby team's strength and conditioning coach, and Dave Alred, the one-time England kicking coach, to the Olympics at their own expense. Despite declaring a \u00a31.3m pre-tax loss in its accounts to last December the BOA has a no-expense-spared approach to success but that does not stretch to Alred's and Reddin's tickets.</p> <p>Woodward is also to employ Sherylle Calder, the specialist vision coach, at the BOA. Calder joins the team on a six-month-a-year basis through a six-figure sponsorship agreement Woodward has struck with Johnson &amp; Johnson. </p> <p>Next will come the introduction of a coaching programme Woodward has designed. He has identified five \"cogs\" - skills development, athletic development, talent, leadership and coaching - as the keys to Olympic gold. Woodward says that getting it to fit within the elite-sport structure has been his \"most challenging area\". </p> <p>UK Sport, the government funding body ultimately responsible for Olympic success, has its own programme and says Woodward must tailor his to theirs. \"We've agreed it [Woodward's scheme] must be led by the sports governing bodies and by our own Mission 2012 programme,\" said a spokesman. </p> <p><strong>VIP treatment for Jowell</strong></p> <p>Evidence of the high status accorded to the next Olympic hosts came with Tessa Jowell's possession of the hottest ticket in town on Sunday. The minister for London 2012 was permitted entry to the men's basketball match between China and the US. So exclusive was that ticket that alongside her in the VIP area were presidents George Bush - current and former. </p> <p><strong>Noteworthy confusion</strong></p> <p>With the Chinese authorities censoring websites, suggestions yesterday that local reporters had had notebooks confiscated sparked International Olympic Committee intervention. The US volleyball team press conference was dominated by questions about the fatal stabbing of the father-in-law of the coach, Hugh McCutcheon, whose mother-in-law was also a victim in the attack and whose condition remains serious. Senior IOC officials ordered the Beijing Organising Committee for the Olympic Games to investigate. But this column tracked down the junior official who BOCOG says caused the storm and she insisted it was merely a case of Chinese whispers. \"The journalist is my friend,\" said Pao Yin, who works in media services for BOCOG. \"He works for [Chinese state news agency] Xinhua and I just borrowed his dictaphone.\" </p> <p><strong>Iran's poolside politics</strong></p> <p>They say sport and politics do not mix and for those who dare combine them it is a complicated business. Iran's National Olympic Committee had envisaged \"no face-to-face situation\" between its swimmer Mohammed Alirezaei and the Israeli Tom Be'eri in their 100m breaststroke heat on Saturday, meaning he was not expected to withdraw. Iran f\u00eates athletes who pull out of events against anyone from - as the NOC president terms it - \"the Zionist regime\". But when Alirezaei did withdraw anyway this was apparently due to appendicitis; thus was a potentially tense meeting averted. But when Russia met Iran in basketball, it was handshakes all round, even for the Russia coach, David Blatt, an Israeli citizen. According to Iran's NOC this is acceptable since \"the coach doesn't have any importance and he is not representing [Israel]\", said Hussain Choandini, director of public relations at Iran's NOC. \"Russia is a friend of Iran.\" </p> <p><strong>Strike out the brand</strong></p> <p>Beijing officials have a hair-trigger response to the merest hint of ambush marketing. Journalists sheltering under hired umbrellas from the Foreign Experts Building at the medal ceremony after Nicole Cooke's cycling win on Saturday found operatives leaning over them to apply gaffer tape over the hotel's logo.</p>",
  "<p>Last week, Britain's sports minister, Gerry Sutcliffe, told his Australian opposite number, Kate Ellis, that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/08/china.olympics20081\">his Olympic team</a> was stronger than her Olympic team. That's funny, said <a href=\"http://www.foxsports.com.au/beijing_olympics/video/0,,Olympics%20News_8679,00.html\">Ellis</a> (while smirking so much she may as well have made the \"loser\" sign on her forehead), seeing as how your Olympic team \u2013 and indeed your entire country \u2013 are a bunch of namby-pamby chokers who soil their jockstraps at the merest hint of pressure. Pressure that you've just ramped up by the way, she added, giving Sutcliffe a nasty Chinese burn.</p> <p>While everyone was yelling \"fight, fight, fight!\", British Olympic Association chairman, Colin Moynihan and his Aussie opposite number, John Coates, were at the other end of the Olympic playground, having a side bet on whose team would win. They've agreed to exchange a bottle of fizzy pop for every medal that <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24128604-2722,00.html\">separates the two teams</a>.</p> <p>Business as usual between the Poms and the Cons, then.</p> <p>As a Brit living in Sydney, the banter <a href=\"http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/comments/0,22023,24138334-11088,00.html\">never ever stops</a>. It's one of the things I usually love and occasionally hate most about the place. The relationship between our two nations is based almost entirely on incessant piss-taking, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2003/nov/20/rugbyworldcup2003.rugbyunion11\">often about sport</a> \u2013 the kind of good-natured badinage that few other countries can truly appreciate/sink to.</p> <p>Of course, there is an underlying edge to the sledge. On our part there is a degree of jealousy of their success and a distaste for their unsporting arrogance. For them there is, I suspect, an element of resentment about the so-called motherland, the Queen they are supposed to bow to, and the union flag that stoically defends its corner on their flag.</p> <p>National sporting pride is so entrenched here, it is part of the Australian stereotype. \"Newer countries with emerging cultures such as the US and Australia seem to use international performance as a way of reinforcing their presence and importance on the world stage,\" explains Jeff Bond, former head of sports psychology at the gold medal factory that is the Australian Institute of Sport. \"So for them it's very black and white \u2013 winning and losing is the only thing that matters.\"</p> <p>Up until relatively recently, the British have been the gallant after-you-sir losers of world sport. But in 2003 England won the rugby world cup, beating Australia in their own backyard <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2003/nov/23/rugbyworldcup2003.rugbyunion2\">in the final</a>. Then the cricketers followed up in 2005, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/sep/13/ashes2005.ashes1\">winning the Ashes</a> for the first time in a generation. Suddenly we became decent competition again. Which is why the Aussies were so merciless in their gleeful abuse during the 5-0 Ashes whitewash in 2006/07. \"Tonk a Pom\" was the campaign catchphrase of Ford, one of the <a href=\"http://forums.whirlpool.net.au/forum-replies-archive.cfm/631335.html\">main sponsors of the series</a>.</p> <p>The baiting quietened down a fair bit when England beat Australia in the rugby world cup last year. Again. But in the last week, sledging has become an event worthy of the games themselves. \"Maybe we missed this, but we weren't aware that whinging is an Olympic sport,\" wrote a leader writer in <a href=\"http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,,24139694-5001030,00.html\">Sydney's Daily Telegraph</a> last week. </p> <blockquote> <p>[Their] hopes are pinned on the record spending on Britain's Olympic athletes in the past four years. We'd remind [them] that it isn't all about money. At some point, talent and ability become involved. That's generally the point at which Australian athletes stride into the distance.</p> </blockquote> <p>Sir Clive Woodward, who coached England to that 2003 world cup victory, was back in Sydney last year for the Australian Youth Olympic Festival on a spying mission in his new capacity as director of elite performance at the British Olympic Association. Over breakfast one morning he told me that the BOA had specifically set their sights on reining in Australia in Beijing as they build towards London 2012.</p> <p>Woodward attributes the recent <a href=\"http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/article1075838.ece\">improvement of British sport</a> to a \"winning mindset\". In other words, no more British under dog. As any sports psychologist worth his isotonic electrolytes will tell you, half the battle is mental. The Australians and the Americans have been confidently backing themselves for years so it's good \u2013 if a little out of character \u2013 to see the British doing likewise.</p> <p>Last weekend in Sydney, the patriotic spirit was in evidence during the 70,000-strong <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/photogallery/2008/08/10/1218306630851.html\">City 2 Surf 14k fun run</a>. Early in the race we ran through the cross-city tunnel (just under the Coke sign for those that know it) and someone tested out the echoey acoustics with an enthusiastic \"Aussie Aussie Aussie!\" to which the Pavlovian response from what must have been 1,000 runners was a resounding \"Oi Oi Oi!\" A lone Brit then bravely tried a forlorn chorus of \"In-ger-lund\" in response. I couldn't bring myself to join in, but I did enjoy making things interesting with a few bets at work today. If nothing else, it should enliven the dressage and shooting.</p>",
  "<p>Forget dedication. Originality, innovation and the blagging skills of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Power\">Karl Power</a>, that's what you need. At least, if you want to wangle some money out of the Dragons. <a href=\"http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/organgrinder/2008/08/dragons_den_series_6_episode_3.html\">Last week</a>, Deborah Meaden loosened her purse-strings to invest in the Misfuelling Prevention Device, and Heidi continued her frankly rather worrying Peter Jones obsession. This week, I'm advised we should be eagerly anticipating yet more underwear, and a self-wiping motorcycle helmet.</p> <p><strong>8.58pm:</strong> The dishes being served up on Chinese Food Made Easy are making me hungry. Ching-He Huang has just had her show hijacked by her parents, brother and sister-in-law who have turned up unannounced from Shanghai, and it's all gone a bit Surprise Surprise. And I've gone a bit tearful.</p> <p><strong>9pm:</strong> \"These are the Dragons...on their way to the Den.\" For this is DRAGONS' DEN. Montage of the Dragons being mean. They know how to succeed. They are enterprising and wealthy, and built their fortunes up from scratch (just like Rex. Grrrr). You know who they are, you know what they do, so let's get on with it.</p> <p><strong>9.03pm:</strong> Semi-clad man alert! Presumably he's modelling the new range of underwear. Heidi, do you think Peter will try some on?</p> <p><strong>9.04pm:</strong> Michael North from Somerset wants \u00a350,000 for 10% of his business. He bids them greeting, and he wants to introduce them to the \"Fresh Olive Oil Club\". Olive oil is even more diverse than wine, and thus lots of people will want to join the club. Well, 57 people will. That's all he has so far.</p> <p>Theo asks him about himself. He used to be an engineer. He sold insurance. He lived in Greece, and then moved to the UK. He is very keen on olive oil.</p> <p>James asks about his business plan. There won't be one bottle of olive oil delivered a month - \"This is something you've got to try and get your head around,\" says Michael - and he admits that he's not very good with figures. So James does some elementary maths testing with him, planning for the next three years, and realises that his money is not safe with a man who cannot multiply by three.</p> <p>Deborah likes olive oil because she likes food, and wants to know when she can expect her bottles to be delivered. Michael waffles about her not understanding his business, and Duncan agrees that they're all idiots. Heh. Deborah then tells him that she buys expensive olive oil in the shop all the time, and Michael tells her that she doesn't. She says she does. It then descends into him telling her that she is wrong every time she says something, which is an interesting tactic to get money out of someone.</p> <p>Michael distributes samples of oil and teaches them how to taste it. Peter is laughing as he drinks. Deborah smiles and then hides it. Peter says that he can feel pepper at the back of his throat, and is told that he's dehydrated. WRONG and DEHYDRATED - what next? Criticising James's facial hair?</p> <p>Theo says, \"You are the easiest person in the world to fool. I don't want to invest in your business. If I invested in you, I would have to run your business.\" He's out, obviously. James says membership clubs are not big businesses, and he is out. Duncan says it is a great business model to get a couple of hundred quid off thousands of people each year, and use their money to travel round the world having a great time. Ouch. Deborah would love to invest because it's dear to her heart, but as a consumer she wants olive oil on her salad in the summer, not when they can be bothered to send her a bottle. She's out. It's all on Peter. He likes \"colourful\", viz a viz Levi Roots, and thinks it'll be successful, but it's a shame that he can't get into the retail end of the market, and he's out.</p> <p><strong>9.17pm</strong>: A man from Essex selling pants utterly loses his train of thought and stops talking. Then he brings in a lovely model in lovely pants, and Deborah covers her eyes in horror. Theo likes pants, as we know, particularly lovely ones, and especially these special ones that sculpt, ahem, a gentleman's undercarriage. Peter thinks they are a bad idea because it'll just result in disappointment when the pants are taken off. \"By the time you get to the pants, it doesn't matter if you look good or not!\" says Duncan. No investment.</p> <p>Is that it? Oh, Dragons' Den, you tease us.</p> <p><strong>9.19pm:</strong> Two ladies want \u00a380,000 for 10% of their company, which produces the Buggy Boot. Basically it's like a little platform to keep your basket on when you go round, and load your bags on to when you've finished. They've had lots of interest already. Peter Jones has five children, whom I'm sure he takes round the supermarket all the time, and he wants to know how long they've been going and how much they've invested (answers: three years, and \u00a3100,000). At the moment, there's no other product that does what their product does, but there are simpler ones.</p> <p>Duncan is pulling his sceptical face and wants to know how you'd disassemble the platform for installation on another buggy. The ladies tell him you'd need a key. He's not impressed. He's out. Theo asks about expenditure and what they'll do with the money. They want \u00a340,000 to pay for an admin person. Wow. Let's all apply for that job. Theo's out. Deborah wants to talk about the distribution deals they've got, which combine to 3,000 units overall. James asks how they got the money they invested - \"Did you remortgage your homes?\" They did NOT. They worked and saved.</p> <p>Deborah offers \u00a380,000 for 30% of the company on the condition they write off their directors' loans. Peter was thinking about investing, but he's out. James would think about it, but he wants a higher percentage, so he's out, but he recommends that they accept Deborah's offer. The nice ladies go to the back of the room to have a quick board meeting. They come back and ask if she'd negotiate. Of course she won't bloody negotiate. They then ask what she'll do for their company. HAHAHAHA, are you seriously asking? Like you're doing her a favour by letting her invest? Deborah quite rightly slaps them down, they accept the original offer, and there are hugs and kisses all round.</p> <p><strong>9.31pm</strong>: Oh dear me, Mark from Liverpool is pitching his motorcycle visor by wearing his helmet and then spraying water on his head. Theo tells him to go away and talk to some manufacturers. Peter tells him to go and get a patent, and then make a fortune. A lady with a dog pitches the Poo Pod, which is like a dog-lead handle that flicks open, and then when your dog messes when you're out for a walk, you can bag it and clip it in there. The Dragons like it but they're not going to invest. \"Good luck, come up with some other ideas,\" says Peter. \"Seems like you're pretty good on dog poo.\"</p> <p><strong>9.34pm</strong>: Father and son David and Robert want \u00a350,000 to enter the Formula Ford championship. He's in his leathers, he has a billion trophies, and David is quite rightly proud of him. I'm welling up again. In return for investment, they are offering ad space on the car, and 40% of Robert's driving earnings over the next ten years. Robert does a little talk about how he believes he will make it as a Formula One driver. That's quite touching too.</p> <p>Shockingly, Deborah isn't all that bothered about car-racing, so she wants to know some hard facts about rankings and famous people she might have heard of who have driven in the same sort of competition. Robert likens himself to <a href=\"www.racecar.com\">Jenson Button</a>. Duncan tells him investment is a gamble, and he doesn't want advertising space. \"We know the only way we can progress his career is to find serious sponsorship,\" says David. Duncan can't get past them offering 40% of future earnings, and he and David have a little swipe at each other.</p> <p>Peter likes fast cars, and thinks this is a great opportunity. He suggests that he and Theo could advertise their company Red Letter Days on the car, and then gets carried away with the excitement. Theo tells him to shut up, and asks David and Robert what would happen if the results in the competition didn't go as well as expected. \"We'd have to raise more money,\" says David, and then lets slip that to move up the classes towards Formula One, an investor would need to fork out millions. And Robert doesn't get paid for driving in Formula Ford. So he's basically asking for enough money to get him into Formula One, and there's no guaranteed return on any of it. Duncan's out; James admires the passion and wishes him well, but he's out; Deborah says it's not a business opportunity, so she's out, and Robert is actually going to cry. Theo says it's not investable for any of his companies, including the ones he runs with Peter, so he's out. Peter is impressed with what they've done, but he's out.</p> <p><strong>9.45pm</strong>: A man pitches an internet site where you can track people according to their mobile phone signals. Peter is worried that wives might find out their husbands are in the pub when they should be at home. A couple pitch a big old slidey photo frame for parents and schools to put children's artwork in. Duncan likes them and buys one for a tenner. Peter wants one too. They don't like them enough to invest, though.</p> <p><strong>9.48pm:</strong> Andrew has bought a factory rather than a house. He wants \u00a3150,000 in exchange for 15% of his company, which is called Rapstrap. He manufactures polyurethane cable ties that you can clip down and reuse, and are intended to replace the nylon cable ties that are on the market at the moment. Shouldn't it be called Wrapstrap? Seeing as it's a strap that wraps round, and all?</p> <p>Theo decides to destroy the product sample he's given, and wonders why people wouldn't prefer the stronger nylon cable tie. Andrew tells him that people don't need strong cable ties, they just need to tie things together, and Theo suggests using Velcro instead. That's too expensive, counters Andrew. Under questioning from James, we learn that Andrew has had interest from lots of places but has put production on hold until he secures investment. Duncan asks about finance and patents and the legal shenanigans, and then Deborah wants to know exactly what has been patented, which is a reasonable question. Andrew does a little gesture-based demonstration, which is strangely endearing, and then confesses he's expecting to make a loss in Year One, and a tiny profit in Year Two. Peter is not impressed by the slim profit margins.</p> <p>Theo declares himself out, and Andrew asks if he'd stock the (W)Rapstrap in his stationers' shops. He laughs. James will make him an offer of \u00a3150,000 for 50%, shared equally with Duncan, as they're both shareholders in Choc Box, which retails electrical stuff. Gosh, this is all very dramatic. Peter tragically admits that James and Duncan offer better value than him, and Deborah concurs for her, and so they're out.</p> <p>Andrew tries to negotiate. Why do these people never learn? They don't budge, and he accepts the offer.</p> <p>That was a strangely unembarrassing episode of DD, wasn't it? Usually I have to switch over for some kind of relief from the blushing by proxy. Now, I'm flicking over to Channel 4 for you-know-what. Next week, we have tongue-tied ladies and blow-drying gentlemen! Join us then!</p>",
  "<p>Russia has launched a major \"invasion\" of Georgia and is now in control of half the country after a military operation by air-and-ground forces, Georgian military officials claimed this afternoon.</p> <p>Georgia appealed urgently for international help and said it was planning an all-out defence of the capital, Tbilisi, from Russian attack. It said it had withdrawn its troops as Russian forces surged across the west and centre of the country.</p> <p>Russian tanks and armoured vehicles seized the town of Gori - 36 miles from Tbilisi - at about 5pm local time, after advancing southwards this afternoon from the breakaway republic of South Ossetia, Georgian officials said, smashing the Georgian line in two places.</p> <p>Tonight Saba Tsitsikashvili, a Gori resident and local Georgian journalist, said that Russian troops had occupied the main road on the edge of Gori. The troops were in the north of the city but had not yet moved towards the centre, he said.</p> <p>He told the Guardian: \"They are on the central highway which links the east and west of Georgia. This is the situation. People are leaving their villages. They have been told by policemen to leave their villages and houses. </p> <p>\"It's a very bad situation. People are in panic. Nobody knows what to do. This road where the troops are is about 2kms from the city centre. It's very near. The road is closed now.\"</p> <p>At the same time Russian troops were moving across the west of the country from Georgia's second breakaway republic of Abkhazia, in what appeared to be a significant escalation in the five-day conflict.</p> <p>Georgian military officials said Russian troops had seized the towns of Kutaisy and Senaki and were also planning to move forces to the port town of Porti.</p> <p>\"This is a classical full-scale invasion under the umbrella of peace enforcement,\" Irakli Batkuashvili, the head of Georgia's military planning division told the Guardian tonight. </p> <p>He added grimly: \"This is an occupation.\"</p> <p>\"Half of Georgia is under Russian control. Our aim now is to build up our troops and to create a defensive line in front of Tbilisi. We will fight defending Tbilisi.\"</p> <p>The pace of the Russian attack appears to have caught Georgia's vastly inferior armed forces by surprise. Russia had previously insisted it had no intention of moving beyond the existing conflict zone in South Ossetia - briefly captured and then abandoned by Georgian forces.</p> <p>Amid a day of claims and counter-claims, a senior Russian general had said there were no plans to move its troops deeper into Georgian territory. Russian officials denied that Gori had been occupied and Georgian assertions that it had fallen to Russian forces were disputed by some witnesses, who said they saw no troops in the deserted town. </p> <p>The Georgian president, Mikhail Saaskashvili, visited Gori earlier in the day, before being bundled away by his security staff.</p> <p>Georgia has asked for a ceasefire but Moscow has refused, arguing Georgian troops are still fighting in South Ossetia. Tblisi said up to 50 Russian bombers attacked its territory overnight, with one Russian bomb reported to have landed near the civilian airport of Tblisi, shortly after the French foreign minister, Bernard Kouchner, had touched down.</p> <p>News of the latest fighting came as Britain condemned the Russian attacks as \"deplorable\". Gordon Brown called on Russia to accept Georgia's offer of a ceasefire, saying Russian military action threatened regional stability and could damage Moscow's ties with other countries.</p> <p>\"There is no justification for continued Russian military action in Georgia, which threatens the stability of the entire region and risks a humanitarian catastrophe,\" the prime minister said in a statement. \"There is an immediate and pressing need to end the fighting and disengage all military forces in South Ossetia.</p> <p>Nato's secretary general, Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, joined the US president, George Bush, in criticising Russia for \"disproportionate\" use of force. Nato said in April that Georgia would one day be a member of the alliance.</p> <p>Bush told a US sports broadcaster in Beijing, where he was watching the Olympics, that he had spoken firmly to the Russian prime minister, Vladimir Putin. \"We strongly condemn bombing outside of South Ossetia.\" Moscow has justified strengthening up forces in Abkhazia as an attempt to prevent what it called Georgia's \"genocide\" in South Ossetia's capital, Tskhinvali.</p> <p>Putin in turn criticised the US for flying 2,000 Georgian soldiers back from Iraq, where they make up the third-biggest troop contributor after the US and Britain.</p> <p>\"It is a shame that some of our partners are not helping us but, essentially, are hindering us. I mean \u2026 the transfer by the United States of a Georgian contingent in Iraq with military transport planes practically to the conflict zone. The very scale of this cynicism is astonishing - the attempt to turn white into black, black into white and to adeptly portray victims of aggression as aggressors and place the responsibility for the consequences of the aggression on the victims.\"</p> <p>Moscow says 1,600 civilians have been killed in South Ossetia, along with 15 Russian peacekeepers killed and 70 wounded. Saakashvili, told reporters at a press conference this afternoon Russia's attack against Georgia was \"the pre-planned, cold-blooded murder of a small country''.</p> <p>He accused Russia of attempting to occupy the whole country. \"This provocation was aimed at occupying South Ossetia, Abkhazia and then all of Georgia.\"</p> <p>Saakashvili said 90% of Georgian casualties were civilians. \"They are specifically targeting civilian targets. They've been targeting highways in Georgia which are especially crowded at this time of year because of returning holidaymakers,\" he said.</p> <p>Georgia had previously said 80% of casualties were military. Georgia's envoy to the EU, Salome Samadashvili, said the EU must tell Russia to pull back or \" risk their future relationship with the European Union\". EU foreign ministers are expected to meet over the crisis on Wednesday. There are concerns that oil prices, which have fallen in recent weeks, may rise again because of the crisis.</p> <p>Saakashvili told the US vice-president, Dick Cheney, in a phone call that Russian aggression must not go unanswered. Cheney did not spell out what might follow, but threatening to expel Russia from the G8 is one possibility that has been raised in the past by the Republican presidential candidate, John McCain.</p> <p>The Russian ambassador to Nato, Dmitry Rogozin, said Moscow had asked for a meeting with the alliance to explain its actions. Nato ambassadors are meeting tomorrow with Georgia's foreign minister, Ekaterina Tkeshelashvili.<br>The World Food Programme has started distributing food to help displaced people, and has said the number of people needing assistance is \"rising by the hour''.</p>",
  "<p>By <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/georgia\">using force</a> to bring back the breakaway region of South Ossetia under central control, Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili has inadvertently gifted the Kremlin <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/11/georgia.russia3\">a chance to retrieve</a> the influence it had lost in the Caucasus to the United States. <br> Ever since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Russia <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/20/russia.georgia1\">has watched with growing alarm</a> how the successive US administrations have violated the promise made by President George HW Bush to respect the status quo existing at the time of the end of the cold war in 1990. The eastward expansion of Nato, which started during the Bill Clinton presidency, has covered not only the Baltic states, but also all of the east European members of the now-defunct Moscow-led Warsaw Pact. As if this were not enough, plans are being made to expand Nato to admit Ukraine, a former European constituent of the Soviet Union, and Georgia, a former Caucasian constituent of the Soviet Union. <br> Already, the Pentagon had established its presence in Georgia and Azerbaijan. It posted its officers to these Caucasian republics to train Georgian and Azeri forces to guard the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2005/may/26/businessqandas.oilandpetrol\">Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) oil pipeline</a> \u2013 connecting Baku, the source of oil, with the Mediterranean port of Ceyhan, in Turkey. Moreover, under guise of waging \"war on terror\", the Azeri government allowed the Pentagon to upgrade the <a href=\"http://www.the-airport-guide.com/airport.php?airports_id=10017\">Nasosnaya military airfield</a> north of Baku. <a href=\"http://www.democracynow.org/2007/1/31/blood_of_the_earth_dilip_hiro\">As I have discussed</a> in my book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Blood-Earth-Battle-Vanishing-Resources/dp/1560255447\">Blood of the Earth</a>, that gave the US greater flexibility in transporting troops and deploying its air power in the region. <br> The Pentagon's continuing intrusion into Russia's backyard has been worrisome to the military leaders in Moscow. They see it as part of Washington's overarching policy of encircling Russia. Now, Saakashvili's ill-conceived move has provided them with a rationale to flex their muscles and claw back some of the influence the Kremlin has been wont to exercise in the Caucasus over the past two centuries.  On the American side, intent on monopolising the exploitation of the hydrocarbon resources of the Caspian Basin, the Clinton administration resolved to exclude Russian and Iranian oil companies from exploration and extraction. It succeeded. Yet, there was the task of delivering the crude oil to where it was needed \u2013 Europe. With their already-established pipelines leading to maritime terminals, Russia and Iran were well-placed to provide the transit facilities.  To exclude Russia and Iran even from this phase, Washington favoured the construction of the 1,090-mile Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline, even though it was twice as long as the alternative route of Baku-Tbilisi-Suspa, the Russian port on the Black Sea, and passes through a highly seismic landscape. The US government went on to grant $823m to Turkey for this project, amounting to more than a fifth of the total cost.  Although the presidents of Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan and Turkey signed (under pressure from Washington) a document in 1998 favouring the BTC pipeline, it was not until 2006 that it was built. During the present conflict, the Russian air force has tried to hit this pipeline \u2013 so far without success. By attempting to do so, the Kremlin is sending a message to Nato member states: the BTC pipeline, built at great cost in order to circumvent Russia, is now vulnerable. Of course, any damage to the pipeline can be repaired. And the events of the past few days will enable Washington to convince its allies that, despite the odds, it had pursued the right policy of excluding Russia from the ventures of the western oil corporations in the Caspian Basin. </p> <p>On the other hand, with Europe importing 25% of its natural gas needs from Russia, there is no prospect of it ensuring its energy security by excluding the Russian behemoth, Gazprom, from its list of hydrocarbon suppliers. All that western capitals can now hope is that the popular backlash in Georgia, which is bound to follow Saakashvili's blunder, does not lead to his overthrow and replacement by a leader who is not as determinedly anti-Russian as he is.</p>",
  "<p>For more than 200 years, tsars, generals, and politburos in Russia have controlled Georgia. But for the past 17 years since the collapse of the Soviet empire, the small country on the south side of the Caucasus has gingerly embraced a new experience as an independent state - unstable, immature, chaotic, corrupt, but hopeful.</p> <p>Vladimir Putin cannot abide that notion and appears bent on trying to restore a version of the status quo ante.</p> <p>\"Russia has played a positive, stabilising role in the Caucasus for centuries, a guarantor of security, cooperation and progress,\" the Russian prime minister said at the weekend. \"This is how it was in the past and this is how it is going to be in future. Let there be no doubt about this.\"</p> <p>By the time his 58th army, his air force, his spetsnaz paratroopers, and his Black Sea fleet are finished in Georgia, Putin knows where he wants to be. The Georgians, he said, \"will objectively assess their current leaders\" and their \"criminal policies\".</p> <p>In other words, President Mikhail Saakashvili, wayward darling of the west, will either be much diminished or finished. Saakashvili thinks that's the whole point. \"This is not about South Ossetia, this is not even about Abkhazia,\" the Georgian leader said. \"\"It's all about independence and democracy in Georgia. Putin is personally commanding this operation. The purpose is to depose the democratically elected government of Georgia.\"</p> <p>A former Pentagon official long involved with Georgia agrees: \"The strategic objective is regime change. Putin wants a puppet, a satrap. He is playing an extremely good game.\"</p> <p>Georgia is Putin's second war. The first was launched nine years ago, also in August, in neighbouring Chechnya at the beginning of Putin's rule and it entrenched him in power. The current campaign, at the start of President Dmitri Medvedev's term, marks a watershed - the first time the Russians have wielded their guns in anger beyond Russia's borders since the Soviet collapse and the end of the cold war.</p> <p>Putin despised Saakashvili's predecessor, Eduard Shevardnadze, the former Soviet foreign minister and Georgian president, as the man who gave away the Soviet Union. But his contempt for Saakashvili is much more intense.</p> <p>Since the American-educated Georgian led the 2003 Rose Revolution, Putin has striven mightily to subvert Tbilisi - trade boycotts, embargoes on Georgian wine, fruit, and mineral water, deporting thousands of Georgians who run Moscow's vegetable markets, cutting transport links over and through the Caucasus, turning off the oil and gas and stopping the post.</p> <p>It's personal. Saakashvili has been telling western officials and diplomats for months of a looming war and of a foul-mouthed exchange with Putin in April. Last month in Dubrovnik, the Georgian leader told senior US state department officials about the war plans and was warned there could be no military solution to the intricate ethnic conflicts of the Caucasus.</p> <p>Saakashvili blundered. Perhaps he imagined he could pull a fast one in South Ossetia last week, perhaps he walked straight into a Russian trap. The results would be risible if not so tragic. His crack US-trained troops - a tenth of his army - took the Ossetian town of Tskhinvali and managed to hold it for all of three hours before being hammered by the Russians.</p> <p>While George Bush watched baseball in Beijing, Putin created facts on the ground. European leaders rushed back from the beaches and villas of August for an \"emergency meeting\" in Brussels, while McCain and Obama used Georgia to sling mud at one another.</p> <p>Saakashvili, who came to power pledging to recover control of Georgia's breakaway regions, has lost South Ossetia and Abkhazia, probably irretrievably, and will be much weakened.</p> <p>Nicolas Sarkozy of France, in Moscow and Tbilisi today, will grandstand as peacemaker and offer to mediate. The Kremlin will dictate the terms of any negotiations and Putin will probably refuse to accept Saakashvili as a legitimate negotiating partner.</p> <p>There is enough blame to go around. The Russians, the Georgians, the Europeans and the Americans are all responsible for the mess. There is only one victor, Vladimir Putin. If he succeeds in bringing down Saakashvili, it will be a greater victory yet, not only over Georgia, but over the west.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> Wakefield.<br> <strong>The lineup:</strong> Stuart Pearson (guitar, keyboards), Andy Howden (vocals, guitar), Andrew Clayton (drums), Rod McFarlane (bass). <br> <strong>The background:</strong> Pavilion are the new Hoosiers. Now, we know that might not cause a rush of blood to the head because even though the Hoosiers sold shedloads of records last year, nobody will admit to liking them and certainly no music journalist has had a positive thing to say about them \u2013 far less popular bands have had far more press coverage in the last 18 months. But we liked the Hoosiers (see New Band of the Day No 69), and we like Pavilion. They're similar: the singer has that swooping, whooping, shamelessly high vocal style and they've got a couple of songs that, like Worried About Ray and Mr A, are so immediately, insanely infectious they're bound to: a) be loved by radio and that medium's civilian clientele; b) be loathed by music journalists; c) be compared unfavourably to ELO; and d) eclipse all their other material because lightning, the creative variety, only strikes twice, especially when it comes to indie bands contriving catchy, melodic pop ditties. <br> Actually, Pavilion already outstrip the Hoosiers in that, from what we've heard so far, they've got three, possibly even four, potential hits. Spoils of War, their debut single, is a real everything-and-the-kitchen-sink affair. Produced by Ryan Jarman of the Cribs at Edwyn Collins and Bernard Butler's West Heath Studios in north London, it's got the galloping drums of Orange Juice circa Simply Thrilled Honey, oodles of strings, Andy Howden's melodramatic vocal, and a choir of manly aah-aahs that suggest they've heard Flaming Lips' The Soft Bulletin (in fact, it's one of their favourite albums). It could have been a mess but the exuberant melody, tinged with sorrow, pulls it through. Plus, it's accompanied by a video featuring the band dressed as bruised and battered world war two soldiers, so that's got to help. Or not. I Got a Plan, surely the follow-up single, is even better. It's certainly even more ELO-ish, with that staccato rhythm Jeff Lynne and co patented on Mr Blue Sky (well, unless you count the Beatles' Martha My Dear) and it's got Edith Bowman and Jo Whiley's names written on it. Not literally, just in terms of the inevitability of it being playlisted. But these aren't their only good tracks. There's a third hit lurking on their album sampler: Clarity is based around a circular riff that recalls Dinosaur Jr's Freak Scene, only it's far poppier than that, the backing harmonies are raggedly glorious, the melody is hardly simple but utterly memorable and it's got a keyboard sound that sounds like sleighbells ringing so it will make a great Christmas single, not that we want to tell their record company how to do their jobs, although with our powers of foresight up here, we wouldn't blame them for handing over the marketing and everything else to us. </p> <p>Pavilion, we feel duty-bound to inform you, have been compared, in the two short years of their existence, to the early 80s postcard bands (O Juice, Josef K, Aztec Camera) but they really don't sound anything like them, apart from the aforementioned galloping drums, while someone described them as sounding \"like Death Cab for Cutie playing rugby league\", which is an interesting image but completely wide of the mark, and besides, we've only ever seen Death Cab playing hockey. Pavilion themselves have said they wish the Beach Boys had never recorded Pet Sounds \"so that we could do it ourselves\", adding: \"Our only limitation is the inevitability of death.\" No, the only inevitability will be the limitations to their career caused by all the comparisons to the Hoosiers, including the ones in this column.<br> <strong>The buzz:</strong> \"The Hoosiers should stop worrying about Ray and start worrying about Pavilion.\" <br> <strong>The truth:</strong> We predict three hits \u2013 then they're on their own.<br> <strong>Most likely to:</strong> Recruit an army of fans. <br> <strong>Least likely to:</strong> Join the army.<br> <strong>What to buy:</strong> Debut single Spoils of War is released by Alcopop on August 25. <br> <strong>File next to:</strong> Hoosiers, Sparkadia, Royworld, the Feeling.<br> <strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/pavilionmusic\">www.myspace.com/pavilionmusic</a> <br> <strong>Tomorrow's new band:</strong> Abe Vigoda. </p>",
  "<p>There is not a single rider in the Olympic three-day event, after the gruelling cross-country stage at the Beas River country club, who can be certain when they enter the showjumping arena for the third and final test that their horse will have the energy or the required discipline to respond.</p> <p>For although it was generally agreed that the weather had been kind, and that the 4,560m helter-skelter cross-country course, with its 29 obstacles, had not been the ride of death that many had feared, and although nobody made it inside the eight-minute time limit, there were nevertheless an awful lot of extremely tired horses in the stables afterwards. They had less than 24 hours to recover before this afternoon's (evening here) d\u00e9nouement, and any residual stiffness can so easily be translated into the horrible clattering of fences.</p> <p>Britain, third overall in the team competition and with Mary King, the 47-year-old mother of two, in joint fifth place individually, left the mountains and returned to the river estuary of Sha Tin with a good deal to look forward to. Yogi Breisner, the British team manager, is a naturally optimistic character, and was by no means ruling out the possibility of turning team bronze into silver, or even gold.</p> <p>The last time Britain won Olympic team gold was at the 1972 Munich Games when Richard Meade established himself as one of the all-time great Olympians, winning team and individual gold to add to his team gold in Mexico City four years earlier. After the cross-country here Germany and Australia had a half grip on the gold and silver respectively, though the memory of the Athens Games brought a sparkle of hope to Breisner's eyes.</p> <p>It was there, on an evening of sustained pandemonium, that Germany's Bettina Hoy rode a seemingly flawless round, only to be penalised for crossing the starting line twice. An appeal rescinded that penalty, and Hoy left Athens with the team and individual gold medals. Then, three days later, the Court of Arbitration for Sport overturned Germany's appeal, leaving Hoy and her team-mates without any medals whatsoever.</p> <p>To say they were on a mission here would be something of an understatement in Olympic terms. In Athens, Britain was bumped up from bronze to silver in the team event while Leslie Law, who now lives and works in the US, became the unlikely individual gold medal winner, and arguably one of the most quickly forgotten British Olympic champions.</p> <p>So nothing can be taken for granted. These are not the huge fences that will confront the specialist show-jumpers later this week. They are designed to test that the horse is sound and the riders still have their wits about them. \"All our riders are good jumpers, so it will be very interesting. I think the pressure will be on the Germans and the Australians,\" said Breisner. Without a doubt nerves will be on edge, while it was noticeable last week that several horses were spooked inside the spacious dressage arena where the jumps will be placed.</p> <p>William Fox-Pitt, whose horse went lame at this stage in Athens, rode one of the best cross-country rounds of the day on Parkmore Ed, and clearly deeply regretted not having performed to his usual high standard in the dressage, for otherwise he might have been in gold medal contention.</p> <p>Matters rarely go to plan in eventing, none more so than for Australia's British-born Lucinda Fredericks who had lead after the dressage and whose relatively small horse, Headley Britannia, had been expected to waltz around the course. \"It did not ride as I expected and I was probably a bit too cautious,\" she said, dropping from first to 11th.</p> <p>Fredericks coaches the Etonian-educated Alex Hua Tian, China's only representative, who fell heavily early on, much to the fury of its rider who blamed himself totally, and on rising to his feet might have sworn in any one of the five languages that he speaks - French, Mandarin, Russian, English and Latin. But he is still only 18 years old, and should do well in future Olympics, assuming he isn't lured into David Cameron's Etonian coterie.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Capacity:</strong> 70 seats, only a handful empty</p> <p><strong>The theme:</strong> The two young Scottish illusionists, who appeared in Channel 4's Tricks from the Bible, aim to baffle and amuse us with card tricks and banter. But are they magicians who tell jokes, or comedians that do magic tricks? They're magicians who tell jokes. Good jokes, yes, but not augmented by the kind of stage presence or comic timing that we are used to from Tommy Cooper or Jerry Sadowitz. When mind-reading, hypnotism and sleight of hand are the main events, however, the gags have less pressure on them, and as such they almost always go down well.</p> <p><strong>High point:</strong> Watching two performers clearly having so much fun together, it is difficult not to be swept along with the occasion. There is still an adolescent tinge to the boys' humour \u2013 their supposed desire to have sex with one another is referenced more than once \u2013 but they remain so cheerful and energetic that this scarcely matters. Their act is a little like being called into the sitting room on a rainy day to watch the children put on a show they've put together just for you. It is disjointed and slight, but occasionally original and always fun.</p> <p><strong>Weak spot:</strong> Like a child's show on a rainy afternoon, it's also a bit of a shambles. This is Barry and Stuart's Fringe debut, and an awful lot went wrong in the hour I watched. Lines were misspoken, jokes were cocked up, at one point a gun even fell out of Barry's pocket prematurely as he ran off stage. Everybody laughed it off, of course, but these details did undermine the effect of the magic, which was never completely polished anyway. What is more \u2013 and this was very annoying indeed \u2013 from where I was sitting, about five rows back, it was virtually impossible to see any tricks that took place below navel height. And quite a lot of them did. I and everybody around me had to peer bad-temperedly around each other's heads when we should have been enjoying the show.</p> <p><strong>Audience participation:</strong> Picking cards, lending phones, drawing pictures, having one's mind read, and, in one case, being hypnotized and glued to a chair.</p> <p><strong>Comic equation:</strong> Penn and Teller/Morecambe and Wise</p> <p><strong>Mark out of 10:</strong> 6 in the front two rows, 4 anywhere else</p> <p><strong>Put this on your poster:</strong> Marvel at their quite-good magic!

  "<p><strong>BAILING OUT OF HUMAN RIGHTS FC</strong></p> <p>After today's meeting with the chain-smoking guy whose job it is to wear a trenchcoat and lurk in the shadows of multi-storey car parks coughing, complaining about his emphysema and dropping hints about conspiracies, the Fiver rushed off to bet big on Mark Hughes being the first Premier League manager to part company with his club this season. According to Oddschecker, he was 16-1 to leave or get the gate before anyone else, but when we logged on to the website of a high-street bookmaker named after marine organisms from the class Anthozoa, the most they'd let us have on was an unbelievably lousy - even by their standards - <strong>10p</strong> at 6-1.</p> <p>So what's happened at Human Rights FC that has Hughes reconsidering his position and bookies being even more miserly than usual? Well, there are those rumours that the club have been trying to sell Vedran Corluka and Stephen Ireland behind the manager's back, not to mention the very real possibility that club owner Thaksin Shinawatra could soon be on the receiving end of one of Dog The Bounty Hunter's patronising pep-talks, having jumped bail in a bid to evade the rough justice for which his home country is renowned.</p> <p>Thaksin and his wife were due to fly from Beijing - a city the human rights enthusiast may have been visiting to pick up tips - to Thailand to answer charges in a property case, but skipped bail and flew to the UK instead. \"What has happened to me and my family and my close relations has resulted from efforts to get rid of me from politics,\" wailed Thaksin. \"These are my political enemies. They don't care about the rule of law, facts or internationally recognised due process.\"</p> <p>Of course while most long-suffering HRFC fans have made it clear they couldn't care less about the origins of their Dear Leader's war-chest, they'll be disappointed to hear that - ill-gotten or otherwise - his \u00a3800m assets are likely to remain frozen in Thailand for the foreseeable future. Of course, should Thaksin wish to make some money to tide him over, he could wander down to his local branch of Coral.

  "<p>Just the idea that the Zimbabwean tyrant Robert Mugabe will remain in power for even longer is terribly unjust. Yet this is what will happen under <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/11/zimbabwe.economics\">a deal</a> supervised by South African president Thabo Mbeki, between Mugabe's Zanu-PF and the opposition <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movement_for_Democratic_Change\">Movement for Democratic Change</a> that will be sealed quite soon now. However, the urgency to get the country out of its morass demanded that negotiations take place, no matter how morally repugnant it is to sit down with a man who bears ultimate responsibility for Zimbabwe's crisis. </p> <p>Another flaw of these negotiations is that Zimbabwe's civil society groups, whose feisty opposition helped to push the unwilling Mugabe and Zanu-PF to negotiate with the opposition, have not been included in the talks. The final deal that will be sealed soon between Mugabe and the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) is unlikely to please everyone. The big stumbling block from the beginning was Mugabe's insistence that he should be recognised as the official president and should retain the widespread powers he had enjoyed before. </p> <p>The MDC wanted the presidency to be a largely ceremonial position. The final outcome goes just about halfway: a presidency with downgraded powers. Agreeing to that meant Tsvangirai had implicitly accepted the results of the phoney June 27 presidential election in which there was only candidate: Mugabe. Mugabe has compromised on limiting the powers of the presidency. Tsvangirai has accepted the position as prime minister, with significant powers, but without \"full\" executive control \u2013 which the MDC argued was fair given the fact that it won the internationally accepted March 29 elections. </p> <p>Mugabe had initially insisted on a meaningless vice-president position. Ultimately, in the long term, Tsvangirai \u2013 and ordinary Zimbabweans \u2013 could still win big if he can pin down Mugabe to make parliament the ultimate power-broker in the transitional period. Until now Mugabe has over-ruled parliament. </p> <p>But parliament's role's should be strengthened. The MDC has a parliamentary majority \u2013 and in combination with the other opposition parties, may have an even a larger one. The MDC must insist on parliamentary and civilian oversight over all the security forces. Furthermore, the MDC must push for at least split control of the security departments. </p> <p>Zimbabwe is run by a junta. Tsvangirai and the MDC should insist on running the economy, if not fully, then jointly. But an integral part of the agreements must also be an independent judiciary and electoral commission, with appointments to oversight bodies taken out of the hands of the president. </p> <p>Tsvangirai should insist on bringing in direct democracy through referendums \u2013 which will also bring democracy closer to the people while helping to circumventi personal rule by the president. An agreement that sees power widely dispersed is the only way to make co-governance with the prickly Mugabe and Zanu-PF remotely tolerable. Part of the deal must be to put solid mechanisms in place to stop corruption, human rights abuses and to restore the rule of law, and bring some accountability to the Zimbabwean political system. Ultimately, the best deal for the MDC is to have the transition over as quickly as possible, within less then 30 months, and then go for fresh elections. Mugabe, not surprisingly, insists on a full five-year term. </p> <p>Mugabe has not taken instructions from anyone since taking power. Governing jointly is going to be a bumpy and frustrating one for Tsvangirai. The MDC has negotiated with its hands bound behind its back. Ordinary Zimbabweans are facing the brunt of Zimbabwe's crisis: starvation, human rights abuses, arbitrary violence and homelessness. Mugabe and Zanu-PF do not really care: they are cold-heartedly prepared to sacrifice ordinary people to stay in power. </p> <p>It is a no-win situation: the longer Tsvangirai holds out, the worse it gets for ordinary Zimbabweans. In the midst of the negotiations, the Mugabe regime and its proxies have continued unleashing violence against ordinary Zimbabweans to pressure the MDC negotiators to concede more. But the Mugabe regime is also feeling the heat. Zimbabwe's continuing financial meltdown \u2013 and the possibility of crippling sanctions if there is no satisfactory deal \u2013 means that Mugabe would be running out of hard cash to maintain his opulent lifestyle and his ability to pork-barrel his supporters. Britain and the US could now play a constructive role upon agreement of a deal by giving the money promised (but not given) at independence for land reform, by scrapping some of the country's debts and by providing assistance without conditions, except transparency ones.</p>",
  "<p>The Chinese man who killed an American tourist on Saturday before committing suicide was motivated by misery, police have said. Tang Yongming murdered Todd Bachman - father-in-law of the US Olympic volleyball coach - and injured two others to \"take his anger out on society,\" Xinhua news agency reported. Quoting police from his hometown of Hangzhou, it said Tang was jobless, had two failed marriages, and had given the proceeds of the sale of his home to his 21-year-old son, who has been jailed for theft. There was no explanation as to why he travelled hundreds of miles to Beijing on 1 August, chose the Olympic period to act, and targeted foreigners and their guide.</p> <p><strong>\u0095</strong> Many Chinese fans have complained about the tastelessness of their team's red-and-yellow uniforms. Now it emerges that the colour could give them the edge. Researchers from Germany's University of Muenster found red sports clothes can affect the referee's split-second decision-making ability when athletes are otherwise well-matched. The study showed that officials gave an average of 13% more points to taekwondo competitors dressed in red than those dressed in blue.</p> <p><strong>\u0095</strong> Was it real? Was it faked? Does it matter? Chinese netizens are debating the special effects used for one of the opening ceremony's highlights, the footprints of fire \"stepping\" from Tiananmen Square to the Bird's Nest stadium. Although the procession of fireworks actually took place, it was deemed too difficult and dangerous to film so viewers instead saw a computer-generated film. The last of the 29 footprints was filmed during the live broadcast, but the Beijing Times said a local company spent almost a year creating the sequence for the other 28, including efforts to capture the slight shake of a camera on a helicopter.</p> <p><strong>\u0095</strong> Two women were among the assailants who hurled homemade bombs in raids that left 12 dead in the northwestern region of Xinjiang, officials said yesterday. Uighur separatists from the region have threatened to disrupt the Olympic games, and Sunday's attack was the second major incident in a week. The authorities said ten attackers and three suspects are still on the run. They added Han Chinese-owned shops were targeted as well as government and police buildings; Han migration has partially fuelled Uighur unrest. Direct involvement by women in violence in the region is highly unusual.</p> <p><strong>\u0095</strong> Despite China's extensive preparations for the games, at least one member of the nternational Olympic committee thinks there is room for improvement. \"We think that, in particular, the military and police can behave in a different manner,\" Gerhard Heiberg, chairman of the IOC's marketing commission, told the Norwegian paper Aftenposten. \"They look like stone faces. The Chinese are scaring the wits out of foreigners. When, in addition, they have weapons and look scary, it is even worse.\" It is not yet clear whether officers will act on his injunction to smile and act nice.</p> <p><strong>\u0095</strong> Abhinav Bindra today celebrated India's first individual gold medal after triumphing in the men's 10-metre air-rifle event. For his mother, however, the efforts are only beginning. \"Now I have lots of work ahead as he is the country's most eligible bachelor,\" Babli Bindra joked to reporters.

  "<p>Gordon Brown today criticised <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/russia\">Russia</a>'s decision to ignore calls for a ceasefire in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/georgia\">Georgia</a>.</p> <p>The prime minister issued a statement this afternoon two hours after David Cameron condemned Russia's actions as \"despicable\". Cameron urged the west to be firm with Moscow because \"the only language a bully understands is when someone stands up to them\".</p> <p>Brown's statement was more measured. He said there was \"an immediate and pressing need\" for the fighting to end and for Russia to disengage its forces from South Ossetia.</p> <p>\"There is no justification for continued Russian military action in Georgia, which threatens the stability of the entire region and risks a humanitarian catastrophe,\" Brown said.</p> <p>\"The Georgian government has offered a ceasefire, which I urge the Russians to reciprocate without delay.</p> <p>\"There is a clear responsibility on the Russian government to bring this conflict quickly to an end. Continued aggression against Georgia \u2013 and especially an escalation of the conflict beyond South Ossetia \u2013 will only serve to damage Russia's international reputation and its relations with countries across the globe.\"</p> <p>Brown said he had discussed the crisis recently with the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, and the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-Moon, and that he was committed to working with other countries \"to ensure a peaceful and speedy resolution to this crisis which maintains Georgia's territorial and political integrity\".</p> <p>In an interview on the World at One, Cameron said: \"What Russia has done here has been to use massive and disproportionate force; it has breached international law, it has violated Georgia's territorial integrity and it is acting as a massive and dangerous bully. We cannot allow this to go ahead without it being challenged.\"</p> <p>Britain and other countries should insist on a ceasefire and on the withdrawal of Russian troops from South Ossetia, he said.</p> <p>When it was put to him that it might be unwise to antagonise the Russians, he replied: \"There's a simple principle. The only language that a bully understands is when someone stands up to them.</p> <p>\"If you say 'This is Russia's backyard, this is a faraway country of which we know nothing, there's not really much you can do', if you take that sort of attitude, you will have more problems with Russia further down the line.\"</p> <p>Cameron said it was particularly important to stand up to Moscow for the sake of the Baltic states with minority Russian populations.</p> <p>And he called for Georgia to be allowed to join Nato sooner than planned. He said this would give other Nato members \"greater leverage\" over what happened in the country.</p> <p>The Foreign Office has advised all Britons in Georgia who do not have an urgent need to remain in the country to leave as soon as possible.</p>",
  "<p>It was easy to spot in Sichuan, and it will undoubtedly be prominent as the Olympics unfold. When the <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/08/03/oly.sichuan.torch.ap/index.html\">Olympic torch toured the earthquake-ravaged province</a> just days ahead of the games, thousands of onlookers sported identical <a href=\"http://shanghaiist.com/attachments/shang_shanghaiist/Untitled-2.jpg\">\"I (heart) China\" T-shirts</a>. The shirts aren't just a fashion statement in this Olympic moment, but <a href=\"http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90782/90872/6419971.html\">a political statement</a>.</p> <p>\"I (heart) China\" serves as the Beijing regime's succinct public response to foreign criticism of China's human rights record: If our people love our country, then you meddlers from outside ought to just shut up. It's a fair point. </p> <p>In China's Olympic moment, foreign critics are focusing on all the country has failed to achieve, from its abundant air pollution to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/05/china.usa\">scant human rights</a>. China's citizens, on the other hand, see all that the country has accomplished after emerging from foreign domination and internal turmoil. They are proud of those achievements and resentful of foreigners pointing out China's shortcomings, especially when those failings don't bother the alleged victims.</p> <p>Bringing the Olympics to Beijing is the latest instalment in a rather straightforward bargain between Chinese government and its citizens that Deng Xiaoping put in place nearly 30 years ago. The regime would maintain its monopoly on political power, but Chinese citizens would get the opportunity to improve their standards of living. </p> <p>In the 1980s, that meant decent shampoo and high heels. Now the price is substantially higher. Consumer goods and rising incomes to afford more and more are no longer enough. To supplement material advancement and fill the spiritual gap left by the demise of communist ideology, the Beijing leadership has offered its version of circuses to go along with bread, including space travel and, now, the Olympics. </p> <p>When Beijing says it wants politics separate from the Olympics, it's talking about international politics. Domestically, the regime has portrayed the Olympics as a great victory for the people of China, global recognition of China's status as a great power and an endorsement of Communist party rule. In short, it's a reason to don your \"I (heart) China\" shirt.</p> <p>With the government's encouragement and heavy diet of propaganda, the Chinese public has been convinced that anti-Olympic protestors are interlopers bent on insulting China. Government control of information has left the Chinese public brainwashed to believe Tibet has always been part of China and that Beijing is bringing civilisation and development to this backward region, not conducting cultural genocide and resource exploitation. The Chinese public doesn't know what Darfur is or understand how China could be part of genocide among Africans. </p> <p>Moreover, as Beijing is happy to remind the world, the internal affairs of one nation are no business of other nations. The Chinese public also largely accepts the government's position that human rights and freedom are expanding in China, and that no country has a prefect record on this score, so therefore has no right to criticise others. People under 30 in China were born under the one-child policy, so these indulged little emperors and empresses may be particularly surprised and aggrieved to witness expressions of anything other than unfettered love for themselves and, by extension, their country.</p> <p>Under these circumstances, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/06/sports/olympics/07prexy.html?em\">George Bush's public criticism of Beijing's human rights record</a> was the worst move possible if he hopes to convince the government to loosen its grip or win Chinese hearts and minds. Public criticism ensures a negative response from Beijing's leaders, who will lose face by making any concessions. It also ensures that the Chinese public will hunker down in those \"I (heart) China\" shirts, particularly when the speaker is ungracious enough to criticise China while a guest on her soil. </p> <p>Combining his criticism with a visit to China sends precisely the wrong message to the Chinese people. As they see it, even though Bush hates China \u2013 why else would he say such hurtful things? \u2013 China is so powerful that he must nevertheless come to the Olympics to honour China's leadership and people. </p> <p>A much better way to try to change China would be to eschew public criticism and, as the Olympic behaviour guide for Beijingers recommends, avoid public displays of affection for the Chinese leadership. In other words, effusively praise China for its cooperation with the US on North Korea nuclear disarmament, for example, while privately condemn human rights abuses and deny it propaganda victories like appearing at the Olympics, unless earned by specific actions. Rather than <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/31/AR2008073101335.html\">meet publicly with five freed dissidents at the White House</a> recently, Bush should have demanded privately that China release the dozens of dissidents it has arrested as part of its pre-Olympic cleanup effort before he agreed to board Air Force One for Beijing. </p> <p>If Beijing meets the demands, you've won a significant victory and Beijing gets a reward. If Beijing doesn't cooperate, you've denied the regime the oxygen of propaganda so vital to maintaining its grip on hearts and minds. The less potent the propaganda, the more likely China's public will be to question what they hear from the official media. But, no matter what you do, it's up to China's people to start asking the questions. Eventually, they may come to understand that for Chinese as well as foreigners, there's nothing incompatible with challenging the government while wearing an \"I (heart) China\" T-shirt.</p>",
  "<p>It might not exactly be a case of all's well that ends well, but England finished a difficult summer on a positive note with a comfortable six-wicket victory over South Africa at The Oval today.</p> <p>England resumed on nought for nought, chasing 197, but an opening partnership of 123 between Andrew Strauss and Alastair Cook put to sleep whatever tension existed, and inched England towards the respectability of a 2-1 series defeat.</p> <p>After a slow start, with only 10 runs coming from the first 10 overs of the innings, Cook took control with a series of majestic pull strokes. Strauss, caught early on off a no-ball from Morne Morkel, was content to play second fiddle - quite an achievement when you are batting with Cook - but the defensive approach worked well in this situation, because once South Africa failed to take early wickets they lost interest and then, worse still, put their faith in Paul Harris.</p> <p>Despite the considerable rough outside the left-hander's off stump, Harris failed to seriously threaten either opener, and when England lunched on 109 for nought the afternoon session became a formality.</p> <p>It was also a chance for Cook to make his first Test century of the summer. For the fourth Test in a row he reached a confident half-century; for the fourth Test in a row he failed to turn it into three figures. On 67, Cook stretched to drive a slightly wider delivery from Makhaya Ntini but could only snick it through to Graeme Smith at first slip.</p> <p>Ian Bell, walking across his stumps to Ntini, was bowled round his legs in embarrassing fashion for four, and there was the merest hint of a collapse when, two balls later, Strauss inside-edged Paul Harris to Smith at leg slip.</p> <p>That made it 147 for three, with 50 still needed, but a liberated Paul Collingwood played some positive strokes in his unbeaten 25. And even the tame dismissal of the captain Kevin Pietersen, caught at short leg off Harris, could not dampen a mood of benign contentment.</p> <p>Andrew Flintoff finished the match in style, clouting Harris for a perfectly straight six, and Pietersen, who was the man of the match and England's man of the series, was all smiles as he shook hands with the South Africans.</p> <p>He knows that tougher challenges await him, not least in England's next Test series in India, but he could hardly have got off to a more satisfying start.</p>",
  "<p>It was a day when sevens hurt. They're never a great number in archery but in the men's team competition, they really, really hurt.</p> <p>First to suffer was Alan Wills. Unlike Simon Terry, who was a teenage bronze medal winner back in Barcelona in 1992, and unlike Larry Godfrey who finished fourth in the individual in Athens, Wills was at his first Olympics. He started well enough in the first-round match against China, but in the final end, and as his team-mates led a dramatic counter with a series of top-scoring tens, Wills landed a seven. And with his last arrow, a six. It meant a quick exit for the British team.</p> <p>Then, so much later in the day, as Korea and Italy laid on a feast of a gold-medal final, it fell to 20-year old Mauro Nespoli to shoot one final arrow, just like the perfect 10 he had shot in the semi final to beat Ukraine, to put Korea under real pressure.</p> <p>Korea, led by world champion Im Dong-hyon, had set off on a dead-straight course for the 24-arrow world record of 231. They peppered the very centre of the target with arrows. They could afford to drop eight shots to beat the record; by the half-way mark they had dropped just two.</p> <p>But then their tens turned to nines and Italy staged a remarkable comeback, led by the defending Olympic champion in the individual event, Marco Galiazzo, who was outstanding all day.</p> <p>In the third end, Italy scored 59 out of a possible 60. As they went into the fourth and final end there was still a gap; when they each reached for their last arrow each, the scores were tied at 199. Galiazzo scored nine, Ilario di Buo, the 42-year old veteran from Trieste, 10. And then came Nespoli's seven.</p> <p>Korea, through Im and Lee Chang-hwan went nine then 10. All Park Kyung-mo needed was an eight for victory. Too easy. He sank a nine for Korea's fourth team gold in the last six Olympics.</p> <p>It was a dramatic final at the end of a competition that provided more tense finishes than in the women's team event. China, on their way to claiming a first-ever medal in the team event, not only overcame a four-point deficit against Russia, they converted it into a four-point lead. The 12th seeds were on their way.</p> <p>Korea, number one seeds, knocked the hosts out in the semi final, but China claimed bronze against the Ukraine. Not without a scare. Struggling to stay in touch, Ukraine changed their shooting order, swapping main man Viktor Ruban with Markiyan Ivashko.</p> <p>Suddenly Ukraine were flying and China were having a wobble. It went to the last arrow. Li Wenquan had been having a bit of a personal slump, but stuck his final arrow into the centre. Some wobbles lead to recovery; others hurt.</p>",
  "<p>The Conservatives are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/aug/11/conservatives.justice\">planning</a> to \"get tough with the bail system\". But shadow justice minister Nick Herbert's view that bail is too easily granted is contradicted by the shocking fact that each year in England and Wales many thousands of innocent people are remanded in prison. Thousands more are held for offences too minor for a jail term. </p> <p>Each year around 54,000 people are remanded in prison awaiting trial. When their case reaches court, up to one in five will be acquitted, usually with no compensation. Up to half will be convicted and receive a community penalty because their offence was not considered serious enough to warrant imprisonment. Two-thirds of women who enter prison now do so on remand and there is a marked increase in the number of children sentenced to await trial in jail.</p> <p>Magistrates typically reach decisions about whether to grant bail inside 10 minutes. Decisions can appear to the defendant to be the result of ticking the right box, rather than applying the explicit exceptions to the presumption in favour of bail individually and in detail. This often needless use of custody could be reduced simply by ensuring first that courts receive in good time the information they need, such as mental health assessments, to make sensible decisions about bail and remand and secondly that, for someone with no fixed abode, safe, supervised accommodation is available.</p> <p>Meanwhile remand prisoners continue to be accommodated in some of the worst conditions in overcrowded local jails, conditions which were condemned by former chief inspector, Sir David Ramsbotham, in his report, <a href=\"http://inspectorates.homeoffice.gov.uk/hmiprisons/thematic-reports1/unjust.pdf\">Unjust Deserts (pdf)</a>. In Scotland, presumption of innocence status is recognised by reserving the best accommodation for those awaiting trial. In England and Wales many remand prisoners are held two to a cell designed for one, often with a convicted prisoner. They usually have to share a cramped space where they must sleep, eat their food and see their cell mate use the toilet in front of them. Some are locked up for 22 hours a day.</p> <p>Many remand prisoners are vulnerable individuals with serious drug and mental health problems. Imprisoning them can have disastrous consequences. A combination of uncertainty, poor conditions and high levels of mental illness combine to increase risk and lead to a situation where 45% of prison suicides last year were committed by people awaiting trial. An <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.howardleague.org%2Ffileadmin%2Fhoward_league%2Fuser%2Fpdf%2Fremands%2520synopses.pdf&amp;ei=aEqgSKesEafYQN3zucsC&amp;usg=AFQjCNHxRvd0PuuW9gqpZOqFB82AwWYDGQ&amp;sig2=V7cPqWlOm1IChRr4J5QChQ\">email (pdf)</a> received by the Prison Reform Trust's advice and information service attests to this:</p> <blockquote> <p>I am very sad to hear the tragic news of one of my good friends death who died in prison on Saturday. He (like myself) had a history of drug abuse problems. I've known a lot of my friends who get out of prison say there is no support for their addictions when they get \"locked up\". What I find hard to take is that he was on remand for minor shoplifting charges. He was a very nice person who had personal problems. He worked hard for most of his adult life until he lost his job a couple of years ago with his dependency problems hence getting in debt from a mortgage and having to move to be with his parents. Wouldn't it be better to have urgent support for people like my friend who get remanded? Why are they locking people up for petty crime?</p> </blockquote> <p>Nick Herbert's determination to toughen up the law in relation to bail and remand runs counter to his party's principled <a href=\"http://www.conservatives.com/tile.do?def=news.story.page&amp;obj_id=145241\">opposition</a> to unlawful imprisonment and the extension of powers to detain people for up to 42 days without charge. What little is left in law of the Magna Carta plainly asserts the fundamental importance of presumption of innocence, trial by jury and habeas corpus. Rather than increase fear of crime by flagging up the few tragic cases in which someone on bail committed a serious offence, it would be more helpful for him to turn his attention to those held on remand who are, as it turns out, unjustly imprisoned. </p> <p>Far from being goaded into further toughening of an already unfair process, the government should act urgently, both to improve the conditions for people awaiting trial in prison and to reduce any unnecessary use of imprisonment. Holding so many people who should be deemed innocent until proven guilty is unjust, uneconomic and puts undue pressure on an overstretched prison system.</p>",

  "<p>Climate change campaigners pledged today to set up a permanent protest camp at Kingsnorth, near Rochester in Kent, if the government allows a large new coal-fired power station to be built there. </p> <p>Their defiant statement came as the police said they had arrested 100 protesters and charged 46 of them during the week-long protest that culminated on Saturday at the existing power station on the site, run by German energy company E.ON. </p> <p>Most of those charged were accused of obstruction offences.

  "<p><br>Mac Daddy ... Bernie Mac was a key player in a group of black comics who transformed stand-up in the States. Photograph: Scott Gries/Getty</p> <p>Bernie Mac, who has died from pneumonia aged just 50, was one of the most popular American comics of the past 20 years. But if the only place you see comedy is on British television, your could be forgiven if your first response was: \"Bernie who?\" Mac was a huge <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC4ul_FYnlQ\">stand-up star</a> who sold out whole stadiums in the US yet received virtually no exposure in Britain. Here, he's far better known as a screen actor, as seen in films including <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/90413/ocean.s.eleven\">Ocean's Eleven</a>, but that was really just an adjunct of his art.</p> <p>Mac was a key player in a group of black comics who transformed stand-up in the States, and inspired a small but significant renaissance of black comedy in Britain. He got his first big break on <a href=\"http://www.hbo.com/defcomedyjam/\">Def Comedy Jam</a>, an immensely influential TV series that showcased a new generation of African American comics, comics who came from the same sort of background as black rappers, and shared their attitudes and inspirations. Yet though Def Comedy Jam was a smash hit in the States, here you had to hunt it down on imported DVDs.</p> <p>It was the same story when Mac teamed up with three other Def Jam stars, and set off on a national tour which revolutionised black comedy in America. Performing alongside <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Harvey\">Steve Harvey</a>, <a href=\"http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&amp;friendID=84250528\">DL Hughley</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ceddybear.com/\">Cedric the Entertainer</a>, The Original Kings of Comedy tour broke all sorts of box office records as it packed out gigantic stadiums all across the USA. America finally realised the power and popularity of black comedy (Bernie Mac's eponymous sitcom, for Fox, was directly drawn from one of his gutsy stand-up routines). Yet if Spike Lee hadn't made a film of it, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Original_Kings_of_Comedy\">The Original Kings of Comedy</a> would have passed Britain by. Until Lee put that show on the big screen, it was left to small scale black British promoters such as Birmingham-based outfit Upfront to bring a few Def Jam comics over here, to show some of us what we'd been missing.</p> <p>So why does British television (and the British media in general) give black American comedy such short shrift - especially the sort of comedy personified by Bernie Mac? It's not really racism, more a sort of cultural arrogance and disinterest, a refusal to engage with any artform outside our domestic comfort zone. Mac and his fellow Def Jam comics spoke with energy and raw candour about topics that make white British liberals uneasy: the nitty gritty of racial and sexual politics. It was an unsentimental vision, and while British punters would have lapped it up, British TV usually opts for something more safe. Personally speaking, Bernie Mac wasn't my favourite US comic. I didn't always agree with what he said, and I didn't always find him funny. But his humour was about his world, another world which I knew next to nothing of, and that was what made him such a fascinating and important entertainer.</p>",
  "<p>When Boris Johnson, mayor of London, led the <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1032330/Boris-dons-pink-stetson-join-Gay-Pride-march.html\">Pride London parade</a> in July, it was seen by many as a defining moment in David Cameron's attempts to rebrand the <a href=\"http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-8580.html\">Conservative party</a> as no more the \"<a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/conservative-leader-completes-transformation-of-the-nasty-party-820354.html\">nasty party</a>\". A photo of Boris grinning with a drag queen threatens to become as much of a cliche of multicultural London as one of a police officer dancing with a black woman at Notting Hill carnival. Look, the Tories really do love the gays!</p> <p>Mayor Johnson may not be so welcome at <a href=\"http://www.sohopride.net/\">Soho Pride</a>, on Sunday 17 August. Organisers are furious that they were only informed that the mayor's office are <a href=\"http://news.pinkpaper.com/NewsStory.aspx?id=298\">withdrawing \u00a310,000 in funding</a> a few weeks before the event is due to take place. They have written to the mayor asking that the decision be reconsidered and explaining that this could mean the end of Soho Pride. They are still waiting for a reply. </p> <p>Soho Pride is not alone \u2013 it is just one of more than 20 community festivals in London which are now under threat, from Chinese New Year to Black History Month and St Patrick's Day. Johnson had said before the mayoral election that he though such events <a href=\"http://ken.bluestatedigital.com/media/johnson_threatens_withdrawal_of_funding_from_londons_community_festivals?text=2\">should be funded</a> \"with private cash, rather than public funds\". Some might think this is a good idea in theory, but it's hard to see how it would be workable for many of them in practice. </p> <p>Soho Pride was started in 2002, as a free street party in the \"gay village\" around Old Compton Street. At that time, Pride London was in the doldrums, due to a series of bad decisions, including its cancellation in 1998, its being renamed \"Mardi Gras\", a separation of the march from the park events afterwards, the introducing of admission charges at the parks, and the dominance of corporate sponsorship. Though this would appear to be the kind of business model Johnson favours, people voted with their feet, and there was a dramatic decline in attendance. But Soho Pride was an instant success \u2013 perhaps because it felt like a real community event, even if it was catering mainly for \"the communities of the night\" of London's gay bar and club scenes. Numbers \u2013 which have topped 80,000 \u2013 began to rival that of Pride London. Boris may have signed its death warrant. </p> <p>This should not come as much of a surprise. Here is a mayor who once compared \"gay marriage\" to a union between \"three men and a dog,\" and has written in support of Section 28, which he called; \"Labour's appalling agenda encouraging the teaching of homosexuality in schools \u2026\" </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PizGjxgTR4\">A speech he gave</a> at the launch of Pride London at City Hall was so rambling and incoherent (\"Gay rights and all the rest of it \u2026\") that it was frankly insulting. When he took part in a \"Gay hustings\" prior to the London mayoral election, he also left many people baffled as to what he actually believed about recent gay equality legislation. </p> <p>His record in office, after just four months, does not bode well. The withdrawal of funding for Soho Pride is not Johnson's first snub to lesbians and gay men in London. In July, he announced he was scrapping the mayor's lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender advisory panel, which was set up by Ken Livingstone in March. His predecessor's support for an LGBT museum in London and the capital's hosting of the Gay Games also now look likely to be quietly dropped. </p> <p>Boris Johnson's advice to London's LGBT communities would appear to be: \"You're on your own, pal.\"</p>",
  "<p>A European democracy is under <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2008/aug/10/georgia.russia?picture=336404631\">full-scale attack</a> from Russia, and EU and Nato leaders are either wringing their hands or sitting on them. The continuing conflict in Georgia is not really about the small south-Caucasus country. By opening up a three-front offensive on Georgia, Moscow is deliberately testing Europe's mettle.</p> <p>The broader west \u2013 European countries, the US, Canada and the host of post-1945 international institutions \u2013 are of course also being tested. But Moscow is particularly interested in how Europe's heavyweights will react. In the wake of serious violence and immense geopolitical consequences, however, Britain, France and Germany have done nothing that might be expected of great powers.</p> <p>This is surprising given that with the stationing of its <a href=\"http://en.rian.ru/russia/20080810/115932226.html\">Black Sea fleet</a> and troops preparing for an amphibious landing off Georgia proper, Russia could at any time cut off Europe's strategic oil link to the Caspian Sea. It is perhaps not that surprising that Russian-backed South Ossetian militia chose last week to attack Georgian troops, sparking the conflict we see now. The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline from Azerbaijan's Caspian shore had just been sabotaged by Kurdish rebels in Turkey, and its exports have been rerouted through a pipeline to Georgia's coast. With just one more bold action, Moscow could control Europe's only major energy import route designed to avoid Russia.</p> <p>Mikhail Saakashvili, the Georgian president, has compared the day's events to the Soviet Union's 1956 <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/4/newsid_2739000/2739039.stm\">intervention</a> in Hungary and the 1968 Russian crushing of the \"<a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/155500.stm\">Prague Spring</a>\". Russia's 2008 strike against Georgia is in fact very different. Hungary and Czechoslovakia were understood to be within the Soviet Union's agreed area of control, cemented by the cold war's nuclear freeze. Today, Georgia is a fully-independent, sovereign democracy, engaged in a concerted, if bumpy, reform effort to achieve Nato and EU membership. Only Moscow deludes itself that its sphere of influence includes Georgia, a country which has sent troops to Afghanistan and Iraq, which hosts US military trainers, western-oriented energy infrastructure and a western-educated leadership.</p> <p>Russia is a nuclear-armed and increasingly indispensable power. The US and Europe cannot satisfy Georgian calls for material aid against their old cold-war foe. They can, however, take a page out of Moscow's playbook. On his way back from the Olympic opening ceremony in Beijing, Vladimir Putin stopped in Vladikavkaz, in Russian North Ossetia, to lend his support to the war effort. Standing amid <a href=\"http://visualrian.com/images/item/329213\">Ossetian refugees</a> and Russian tank columns, the message he sent was that Russia takes Georgia seriously, while many western policymakers are on holiday.</p> <p>George Bush, Gordon Brown, Angela Merkel and Nicholas Sarkozy should all visit Tbilisi next week. That one action would send a more powerful message to Moscow than any military or diplomatic aid. It would also lead to the immediate end of the conflict. Merely the security needed to ensure their safety would necessitate a ceasefire on the part of Moscow. </p> <p>While this scenario may be unlikely, it is the vein in which western leaders should be thinking. John McCain could revitalise his flagging presidential bid in one fell swoop by standing side by side with Saakashvili, while his competitor relaxes in Hawaii.</p> <p>Such a sign of solidarity would be an effective, but short-term measure. For the long term, Europe must finally get serious about security in its neighbourhood. South Ossetia is just one among several ominous thawing conflicts, in Georgia's <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3261059.stm\">Abkhazia</a>, Azerbaijan's <a href=\"http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/nagorno-karabakh.htm\">Nagorno-Karabakh</a> and Moldova's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transnistria\">Transnistria</a>.</p> <p>All four disputes directly or indirectly involve Russia. The raging conflict sparked in South Ossetia only underscores that each hotspot serves as a tool for Russia to block the region's western integration, to keep strategic energy reserves, trading routes and markets in its \"orbit\". This gives Russia a free hand to divide the EU into Russophobes and Russophiles, energy-dependent and energy-hungry states, countries that receive visits from Vladimir Putin, and countries that receive visits from <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/european_football/article756950.ece\">polonium</a>-wielding agents.</p> <p>Moscow's outdated worldview sees an encroaching west as a threat rather than an opportunity for mutual prosperity. Only through a comprehensive stabilisation initiative for Europe's eastern neighborhood, including high-level European diplomatic engagement, peacekeepers, and economic incentives, can the west effectively convince Moscow that it means business \u2013 in more ways than one.</p> <p>Amid the horrific scenes of violence from Georgia beamed to living rooms around the world, let us attempt for a moment to be serious about this conflict and look at the geopolitical causes and consequences. This is not a Balkan-style ethnic brawl in which all sides share the blame for irrational inhumanity. Russia is using ballistic missiles and strategic bombers against a country one-fortieth its size to finally smash the dream of a Europe whole and free.</p>",
  "<p>As the US elections draw closer, America's unions and employers are battling fiercely over proposed legislation that would shake up the country's labour laws.</p> <p>The unions are spending more than $300m (\u00a3150m) to try to ensure across-the-board November victories for Democrats, which would probably guarantee that the Employee Free Choice Act (EFCA) is passed next year. They believe that the legislation, which is opposed by many organisations including Wal-Mart, would help them to reverse their decades of decline.</p> <p>The EFCA will be an early priority in the new 2009 Congress. Among other changes, it will give new powers to workers who want to unionise. </p> <p>But its supporters face opposition from America's business owners, who have begun a plethora of initiatives to discredit the legislation. The Coalition for a Democratic Workplace, made up of employer-centric organisations such as the US Chamber of Commerce, the Association of Equipment Manufacturers and the Retail Industry Leaders Association, is co-ordinating the effort. In its \"public education campaign\" it has started buying <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNNK98ch8Ec&amp;eurl=http://www.myprivateballot.com/\">TV advertising featuring Sopranos actor Vincent Curatola</a> to bolster Republican candidates.</p> <p>The retail association's biggest member, Wal-Mart, is agitating against the EFCA, with the Wall Street Journal reporting that the company held <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121755649066303381.html\">mandatory meetings for supervisors and managers</a> warning them that a Democratic victory in November and subsequent passage of the EFCA would lead to unionisation and union fees.</p> <p>The company issued a statement denying that it was advocating its workers vote against Democratic candidates but added it did discuss the bill's \"negative impact\" with its employees. Wal-Mart said its stance on the legislation is no secret.</p> <p>Wal-Mart's employee relations activities and anti-union sentiments are legendary in North America and the company once closed a store in Canada rather than let its workers organise. <a href=\"http://www.nwaonline.net/articles/2008/06/21/business/062208bigfive.txt\">Analysis of Wal-Mart's 10K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission</a> published in June by the Morning News in Arkansas revealed there are at least 80 class-action lawsuits in 41 states pending against the retailer, 76 of which stem from wage and off-the-clock issues. </p> <p>News of the Wal-Mart meetings incensed unionists. \"Wal-Mart is America's best known corporate bully,\" said Stewart Acuff, a spokesperson for the American Federation of Labour and Congress of Industrial Organisations (AFL-CIO), which is made up of 56 unions. \"They have always bullied their workers; they have always bullied their managers and supervisors and now they are trying to bully the American political system.\"</p> <p>To ensure the deep-pocketed employers don't outspend them in this election cycle, the US labour movement is on course to spend at least $300m - $400m, if you ask the US Chamber of Commerce \u2013 to back Democrats.</p> <p>Aside from aiding the election of Senator Barack Obama as president, perhaps an even more important priority is to ensure voters elect 60 Democratic Senators, which would give the party a filibuster-proof majority and ensure passage of the law no matter who is in the White House. The chances of that happening are unlikely, but not impossible.</p> <p>Acuff said that Obama, who is a co-sponsor of the legislation, will, if elected, not only sign it but also help to push for passage. \"Senator Obama understands this legislation very well. He understands why it is in the interest of the country; why it is in the interest of the economy and why it is in the interest of his presidency,\" he said.</p> <p>End of the secret ballot?</p> <p>The main crux of the EFCA is to make it easier for workers to organise. For decades the employers have chosen the method workers must use to decide on having a union and they have usually called for secret ballots.</p> <p>Under the proposed law the emphasis on who chooses the method switches to the workers. They can stick with the secret ballot or, as is more likely, initiate majority sign-up procedures, which force employers to recognise a union if a majority of employees has signed valid written forms authorising union representation.</p> <p>Acuff said the new law is necessary because the loss of power to form unions and bargain collectively \"has led to 30 years of wage stagnation and now wage decline which has led to the economic crisis that we have today. Nowadays there is just not enough buying power at the bottom.\"</p> <p>US government statistics showed that wages dropped 2.4% in the 12 months to June this year, once inflation is stripped out. Statistics also show the US in 2007 had 15.7m union members, or 12.1% of employees down, from 20.1% of workers in 1983, the first year for which comparable union data are available.</p> <p>The US Chamber of Commerce, which is spending \"several million dollars\" to fight the EFCA, as well as being a party to the $30m Coalition for a Democratic Workplace campaign, sees the possible end of the secret ballot as the biggest fault of the legislation.</p> <p>\"We think this is a fundamental rewrite of our nation's labour laws,\" said Glenn Spencer, executive director for the Chamber's workforce freedom initiative. The Chamber has other problems with the legislation; for instance it allows for binding arbitration if the union and management cannot agree on the first contract after unionisation. Also the bill imposes penalties on employers in a dispute with workers but not on unions if they are in dispute with workers.</p> <p>Spencer says the Chamber is spending its money to educate its members of the perils of the legislation and those members in turn will lobby their elected officials. He claims the employers will be outspent hugely by the unions. What the employers are spending \"will pale in comparison to the $400m the unions are putting in. Frankly we feel a little bit like the 300 Spartans here \u2026 we are totally outgunned.\"</p>",

  "<p> 'Write a nation's curse for me' ... Drawing of captives on a slave ship, c 1700. Image: Hulton/Getty Images</p> <p>Elizabeth Barrett Browning (1806-1861) is often overlooked as a writer of political poetry. When that aspect of her work is considered, it's usually in connection with her passionate advocacy of the movement for Italian unification, the Risorgimento. But she had other important causes. She protested against child labour in Britain, and lent her voice to the Bostonian women's campaign for the abolition of slavery. (It's probably relevant that both her parents' families had considerable slave-owning interests in the West Indies.)</p> <p>\"A Curse for a Nation\", written in 1854, is a simple, striking, three-part polemic against the continuing slave trade in America's Deep South. It begins with a Prologue, which records the summons to write. Barrett Browning overturns the tradition's trope: the poet is visited by a male angel rather than the muse. The nature of the commission is also unusual - to write a curse. Cora Kaplan's ground-breaking 1975 anthology of women's poetry, Salt and Bitter and Good, takes its title from the angel's description of \"A curse from the depths of womanhood\".</p> <p>The poem was a response to the infamous proposal to annex Cuba as a slave state - by force if necessary. It was published in Boston in the 1855 edition of the radical Christmas annual, The Liberty Bell, and went on sale at the <a href=\"http://www.answers.com/topic/maria-weston-chapman\">\"anti-slavery bazaar\"</a> organised by Maria Weston Chapman, where it fetched up on a table selling 19th century Boston's equivalent of \"fine knacks for ladies\" - cloaks, cuffs, purses, inkstands, etc.</p> <p>I found it exciting, when the poet was \"rediscovered\" by feminist academics in the early 70s, to read the verse novel Aurora Leigh for the first time and realise that Barrett Browning was a vastly more interesting and intellectually challenging poet than the \"little Portugese\" (Robert's nickname) of the love sonnets, From the Portugese. The political verse has been a more recent discovery for me. Some of it tends to melodrama, but I rather admire the unembellished punchiness of \"A Curse for a Nation\".</p> <p>\"The Curse\" which follows the Prologue is not literally a curse, of course, though it clearly expresses the belief that slavery and those who promote it are accursed. The insistently hammered-out refrain (\"This is the curse. Write.\") seems to add a further message of its own. The power of transformation doesn't reside in cursing. It lies in moral argument. The resonant imperative, <em>write</em>, addresses the poet's sister-campaigners, surely, rather than the slave-owners and the opponents of abolition. And, of course, it's the political poet's necessary \"memo to self\". Read more about <a href=\"http://www.cswnet.com/~erin/ebb2.htm\">the poem's history here</a> - including an additional stanza from the original text.</p> <p><strong>A Curse for a Nation (Prologue)</strong></p> <p>I heard an angel speak last night And he said 'Write! Write a nation's curse for me And send it over the Western sea.'</p> <p>I faltered, taking up the word: 'Not so, my lord! If curses must be, choose another To send thy curse against my brother.</p> <p>'For I am bound by gratitude, By love and blood, To brothers of mine across the sea, Who stretch out kindly hands to me.'</p> <p>'Therefore,' the voice said, 'shalt thou write My curse to night. From the summits of love a curse is driven, As lightning is from the tops of heaven.'</p> <p>'Not so,' I answered. 'Evermore My heart is sore For my own land's sins: for little feet Of children bleeding along the street:</p> <p>'For parked-up honours that gainsay The right of way: For almsgiving through a door that is Not open enough for two friends to kiss:</p> <p>'For love of freedom which abuses Beyond the straits: For patriot virtue starved to vice on Self-praise, self-interest and suspicion:</p> <p>For an oligarchic parliament, And bribes well-meant. What curse to another land assign, When heavy-souled for the sins of mine?'</p> <p>'Therefore', the voice said, 'shalt thou write My curse tonight. Because thou hast strength to see and hate A foul thing done within thy gate.'</p> <p>'Not so,' I answered once again. 'To curse, choose men. For I, a woman, have only known How the heart melts and the tears run down.'</p> <p>'Therefore,' the voice said, 'shalt thou write My curse tonight. Some women weep and curse, I say (And no-one marvels) night and day.</p> <p>'And thou shalt take their part tonight, Weep and write. A curse from the depths of womanhood Is very salt, and bitter, and good.'</p> <p>So thus I wrote, and mourned indeed, What all may read. And thus, as was enjoined on me, I send it over the Western sea.</p> <p>The Curse I. Because ye have broken your own chain With the strain Of brave men climbing a Nation's height, Yet thence bear down with brand and thong On souls of others, - for this wrong This is the curse. Write.</p> <p>Because yourselves are standing straight In the state Of freedom's foremost acolyte, Yet keep calm footing all the time On writhing bond-slaves, - for this crime This is the curse. Write.</p> <p>Because ye prosper in God's name With a claim To honour in the old world's sight, Yet do the fiend's work perfectly On babes and women - for this lie This is the curse. Write.</p> <p>II. Ye shall watch while kings conspire Round the people's smouldering fire, And warm for your part, Shall never dare - O shame! To utter the thought into flame Which burns at your heart. This is the curse. Write.</p> <p>We shall watch while nations strive With the bloodhounds, die or survive, Drop faint from their jaws, Or throttle them backward to death; And only under your breath Shall favour the cause. This is the curse. Write.</p> <p>Ye shall watch while strong men draw The nets of feudal law To strangle the weak; And, counting the sin for a sin, But your soul shall be sadder within Than the word ye shall speak. This is the curse. Write.</p> <p>When good men are praying erect That Christ may avenge His elect And deliver the earth, The prayer in your ears, said low, Shall sound the tramp of a foe That's driving you forth. This is the curse. Write.</p> <p>When wise men give you their praise, They shall praise in the heat of the phrase, And sicken afar; When ye boast your own charters kept true, Ye shall blush; for the thing which ye do Derides what ye are. This is the curse. Write.</p> <p>When fools write taunts on your gate, Your scorn ye shall somewhat abate As ye look o'er the wall; For your conscience, tradition, and name Explode with a deadlier blame Than the worst of them all. This is the curse. Write.</p> <p>Go! while ill deeds shall be done, Plant your flag in the sun Beside the ill-doers! And recoil from clenching the curse Of the witnessing Universe With a curse of yours. THIS is the curse. Write.</p>",
  "<p>Zipping up my boots. Going back to my roots. Ancestor-worship is spreading out from the aristocracy to the downtrodden masses. Offers received via direct mail to trace your entire family tree for \u00a350 should be treated with scepticism \u2013 often you just get a telephone directory of people with the same surname \u2013 but the yearning is natural enough. When adopted children grow to a certain age they invariably have an urge to meet, or at least find out about, their birth parents \u2013 however much they love their adoptive parents.

  "<p>I didn't have time to ask all your Fallout 3 questions in my <a href=\"http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/games/archives/2008/08/05/fallout_3_interview.html\">recent interview</a>. But Pete Hines at Fallout 3 developer Bethesda has come up trumps and now answered the ones I missed. So read on and found out - amongst other things - about Fallout pacifism and how melee combat works. </p> <p><strong>Will weapons require a minimum Strength? Or only a minimum in its governing attribute? (Perception = Energy, Endurance = Big, Agility = Small).</strong><br>Weapons do not check for minimum stat values, you can use any weapon you want, the skill/stat just makes you better or worse with the weapon.</p> <p><strong>How will Attributes be weighted in regards to the Skills they govern? If you want to max out your Big Guns or Speech skills, but don't spend the SPECIAL pts bumping up Endurance and Charisma, how effective will those skills be? Would a 100% skill level in Speech be ineffective if you only had a Charisma of 4, etc?</strong><br>They provide a boost or bonus to the skills they govern. I don't think we'll get more specific than that as far as exactly how they integrate with Skills. If you put extra points into a SPECIAL, it'll help those Skills beyond what level they're currently at. If you spend all your time leveling up a Skill to a very high level, it's safe to say you'll be very effective at using those skills outside of what the governing SPECIAL is.</p> <p><strong>Is the Intense Training Perk (permanently raise one SPECIAL) a one time use Perk for one attribute, or one time use PER attribute, meaning you could spend 7 Perks/Levels upping each of your SPECIALs?</strong><br>You can use it more than once, so yes you could keep upping each of your SPECIALs, but that's going to come at the sacrifice of being able to do quite a bit of other stuff with available Perks, skill boosts, etc.</p> <p><strong>Is the steal skill really gone, or is it just merged with something else?</strong><br>It's part of Sneak.</p> <p><strong>Though Oblivion looked gorgeous on the PS3, there was a noticable dip in framerate when things got busy. Has the work you did converting the PC original of Oblivion to the 360 and subsequently the PS3 assisted you in developing Fallout 3 for the same target platforms, and allowed further optimisations in performance?</strong><br>Well, it didn't work that way. We didn't convert the PC to the consoles, but the gist of your point is whether working on all that has helped with Fallout 3, and it absolutely has. We have WAY more detail on the screen, loading is faster, and so on. I would imagine you'll see a noticeable difference.</p> <p><strong>In Fallout 1, there were only three key locations that you needed to visit to complete the game - The Cathedral, Military Base and Necropolis (the last one being optional, actually) . These places could be done in any order, creating Fallout's exceptional nonlinearity. Is Fallout 3's main quest structured in similar fashion?</strong><br>Hmm, parts of it are, parts of it aren't. There are several large sections of the main quest that you can actually skip if you do things right.</p> <p><strong>Specific body parts cannot be targeted when fighting with melee weapons or in hand to hand combat. What is the reason behind this decision? Does melee/HtH fighting offer something else to compensate?</strong><br>We tried many ways of doing melee with VATS, and having messed a lot with \"missing\" in melee, it just felt really bad. So once we changed VATS melee to \"always hit\", assuming you are in range, the body part selection became a bit unbalancing, so now it's a \"whole body attack\", but you still do end up hitting a specific body part when you swing, but it's based on what you actually contact with, as opposed to what you aim at. This avoids the \"always punch in the head\" problem, whereas with guns, we can balance out certain body parts with hit percentages, like the head.</p> <p><strong>Charisma influenced the speech skill, NPC's responses and how many followers you could have. Since Fallout 3 allows only two followers, has Charisma's role expanded to some other region?</strong><br>Even though you have only one follower, having a higher Charisma definitely helps in Speech challenges and successfully using special dialog options you have when talking to folks. Also it's very helpful in bartering with people.</p> <p><strong>Can you tag Medicine, Repair and Barter, and focusing on those skills, still be able to complete the game?</strong><br>Sure. We recently had someone play through the game and finish it while only killing one thing very early in the game...a Radroach. I'm not saying I recommend everyone run out and try to play the game as a pacifist, but if you want to give it a try, it has been done.</p> <p><strong>Will damage effects be area specific? Like if I shoot the arm, the arm gets bloody/blown to bits. So far the demos show *head gets shot, leg gets blown off*.</strong><br>The demos look like that when the character in the demo has the Bloody Mess perk. Bloody Mess randomly makes parts fly off that aren't related to what gets hit. You should recognize that aiming at a part (eg, head) doesn't always mean that's the only part that either does or doesn't get hit. A shot at a head can hit an arm, or an arm shot can hit a leg. But yes, damage effects are area specific. Each body part has a status bar that lets you know how much damage that part has taken. Once that bar goes down to zero, that part is considered crippled and the enemy will suffer the effects. Incidentally, it works the same way for your character and you'll also suffer those effects as your body parts get crippled.</p> <p><strong>Can I gain reputation with Supermutants? Or ghouls? Or even Raiders? Can I work with them instead of against them?</strong><br>We're not really talking about that yet.</p> <p><strong>Can we 'skin animals' to make/sell stuff?</strong><br>\"Mostly\" no. There are a few instances of using animal parts to make and sell stuff.</p>",
  "<p>Something you may have missed in yesterday's papers: since retiring from the Commons in 2001 in order to have \"more time for politics\", as he put it, Tony Benn has been busy elsewhere - <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article4493662.ece\">as an inventor</a>.</p> <p>Various Sunday titles detail Benn's pride and joy - the \"frontbencher\", a suitcase that <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1043183/His-safest-seat--inventor-Tony-Benn-83-way-sit-wants.html\">unfolds into a chair</a>.

  "<p>\"I think I can imagine a life with this guy\" gushes Eliza. \"We like the same things, he's really great company and he makes me laugh.\" It's Saturday evening and I am round at her flat for one of those late evening conversations that have peppered our friendship during the last 10 years. Ten years ago, the discussions focused on whether we would find love before 30; today we muse on whether we will find love at all and what love even means. Eliza spent her 20s being indulged and adored by a succession of charismatic and wealthy <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/aug/08/drama\">older men</a> who enabled her entry into a glamorous world she would not otherwise have sampled. They loved her beauty and her youth; today she is still beautiful but not so young and having tired of being single and dating singularly <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/aug/02/familyandrelationships2\">inappropriate men</a>, she now has her heart set on meeting the man with whom she can settle down and raise a family. She seems to believe that she has found her man, but I am not convinced. \"That all sounds great Eliza\", I say, \"but how well do you know this guy? I mean, how many times have you even been out with him?\" Eliza looks up and says \"we've been out for drinks three times\". </p> <p>Time is a turncoat; in our 20s it is a comforting friend, it whispers reassurances and seduces us into believing it will always be on your side. By the time you are in your 30s, time has turned against you, the whisper has become a taunt and the realisation that time is now a merciless enemy colours everything. Nowhere is that realisation more acute than in relationships. When I was in my 20s I could have dated someone for three years and still not been convinced that they were right for me; today I can meet someone and within weeks be naming my unborn children. It's the same when I speak to my single friends: the search for a partner has morphed from a romantic meander to a desperate race against the clock. The knowledge that time is ticking clarifies the criteria that are used to search for Mr or Ms Right. In her 20s, Eliza found herself entangled with a succession of successful, creative men whose chronic irresponsibility and crushing egotism suggested they were not ideal marriage material. Today she tells me that what she most values is someone who would make a good companion, she uses words like \"dependable\", \"solid\" and \"stable\", words that 10 years ago she would have only applied when referring to her wooden coffee table. </p> <p>The impact of the biological clock on women is well known. Men have it easier, but we do not entirely escape time's clutches: time exacts its punishment by deceiving us for longer. We believe we are not growing old, so we think we do not need to grow up. When I asked my friend Peter why he had finally decided to marry at the age of 40 when he had appeared happy to leap from one relationship to another, he told me simply \"I was tired of the merry-go-round\". It was a powerful image: going round and round, hopping on for different rides, the same music playing in the background and ultimately you end up going nowhere. His words reminded me of how when I was in my late 20s I would go out clubbing on Saturday nights and each night I would hope that that would be the night I would meet someone who could rescue me from having to go out on Saturday nights. It's that longing to be taken off the single merry-go-round that is there in so many of my single friends who are in their 30s and still looking for the one who will rescue them. </p> <p>Now, rather than looking in nightclubs on Saturday night, they are increasingly trawling <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/sathnam_sanghera/article4332971.ece\">internet dating sites</a>. It would be easier to be churlish about internet dating were it not for the fact that my friend Sally met someone through <a href=\"http://www.mysinglefriend.com/\">MySingleFriend.com</a> and within a year she was living with him and planning on buying a house together. Sally is 34 and during her 20s was in an eight-year relationship that she ended because she was not sure she was ready to commit. By the time she realised she was, her former boyfriend had found someone else. \"I just know what I want now\" she told me by way of explanation as to why she had signed onto an internet dating website \"and I don't have time to waste anymore\". </p> <p>Not having time to waste: the ticking clock again. I had assumed that <a href=\"http://dating.theguardian.com/s/\">online dating</a> was a virtual meat market, but it seems more akin to a colossal employment website. Looking for a life partner has now turned into a search for someone who will fulfil a discrete set of criteria: will this person make a good parent, will we have the lifestyle we want, will they make a good companion? The applicants online repeat the same bland personal statements, where the women promise they are \"as happy in a bar on a Friday night as pottering through a gallery on a Sunday afternoon\" and the men are all \"potential marriage material\". Eliza told me she recently met a man whom she suspected of having been a serial user of online dating. \"The first thing he said was that he had recently turned 38 and wondered if he would ever have children\" she told me. ''I just felt like I was being auditioned for the role of girlfriend \u2013 it wasn't a date, it was a job interview.\" I guess it is inevitable that as you get older, priorities change, the things you need and want change, as do the things you are looking for in a life partner. Maturity, I think they call it. But it does seem somewhat surreal that this most crucial of choices, which I fought for the right to be based on love and chemistry, seems to be reduced to a set of rushed questions posed to near strangers. It is the emotional equivalent of skipping three years of lectures and cramming the night before the exam. It is not that you will necessarily fail the exam, but you do wonder how much better you may have scored if you had prepared better. When Eliza and I were in our 20s, she was being wooed by the wrong men and I was chasing the wrong girls. We thought we had all the time in the world to eventually find the right ones. But time passes and life changes. \"You remember when we used to talk about love and romance?\" I said to Eliza \"what happened to us?\" She looked at me and said nothing and we both stared into our cups of coffee in silence.</p>",

  "<p>God, I really hope people read this blog. If I don't generate enough comments by the end of the day my editor is going to think I'm such a failure. Embarrassing, isn't it? But this is what I've been hearing in half the stand-up shows on the Fringe this year. A joke fails, or threatens to, and the comic just cannot help but share their anxiety with the audience.</p> <p>\"This is going well,\" grinned <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/aug/06/rob.deering\">Rob Deering</a>, or something similar, when it wasn't. \"I've messed that joke up,\" said <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/aug/09/comedy.scotlandandirelandlistings1\">Tim Vine</a>. \"That was one of my best.\" And you could see that he was quite cut up about it.</p> <p>Yet stand-up comedians, more than any other artists, should surely be familiar with the sting of conspicuous, humiliating failure. Their job is to make you laugh, and if they don't, there is nowhere to hide. Tumbleweed rustles across the stage. They are alone with their inadequacy. And there is nothing funny about it.</p> <p>Which is why so many comics, including some of the very great ones, respond by making a joke out of it. \"Ooh, that wasn't very funny,\" Eddie Izzard used to whisper to himself, and the microphone. And it was a rare Goon Show indeed that did not contain at least one of Spike Milligan's \"That joke didn't get a laugh!\" But while titans like these can withstand a few admissions of fallibility (and even sometimes get bigger laughs from them) most Fringe stand-ups are still fairly small fry in their audience's eyes, and cannot afford to be belittled any further.</p> <p>Playing to a large and appreciative crowd, Tim Vine had enough laughs in the bank to ride out his crisis of confidence. But Rob Deering, in a smaller venue on a Tuesday night, did serious damage to his act - which, frustratingly, was otherwise quite good. Likewise this year, <a href=\"http://www.assemblyfestival.com/webpages/whatson_moreinfobooknow.php?id=3:1212205502&amp;date=all&amp;genre=Comedy\">Matt Kirshen</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/aug/07/edinburghfestival.festivals\">Andrew O'Neill</a> and even Scott Capurro, among those I've seen, have also succumbed to sabotaging themselves under stress. (Though Capurro, as usual, had plenty of help from a drunk and angry crowd.)</p> <p>What all these performers forgot, I would humbly suggest, is a founding principle of their profession: stand-up is dictatorship, not democracy. Audiences cannot laugh and pity simultaneously; they must be ruled with an ironic fist.</p> <p>This need not mean being haughty or detached. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/video/2008/aug/06/lucy.porter\">Lucy Porter</a> kept an amicable relationship with her audience without once ceasing to control them. Even <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/aug/08/Amsterdam\">Hans Teeuwen</a>, with far more precarious material, seemed utterly indifferent to the baffled faces that watched some portions of his act. Like the great Charlie Chuck, he exuded only extraterrestrial calm, allowing the strangeness of his show to grow, without any distractions, into hilarity. And until they're filling 500 seats a night, all stand-ups would do well to follow his example. \"Never apologise,\" as the apocryphal royal motto has it. \"Never explain.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/edinburghfestival\">Click here for all our Edinburgh festival coverage</a></p>",

  "<p>A former youth player for Manchester United today won more than \u00a34.3m damages at the London high court for his injuries from a tackle that ended his career. </p> <p>The amount awarded to Ben Collett - described by the Manchester United manager, Sir Alex Ferguson, as an \"outstanding\" player \u2013 is the largest ever compensation payout to a professional sportsperson in the UK. But the sum will go up when future loss of pension and interest on lost earnings are determined at a hearing set for October.</p> <p>Mrs Justice Swift, sitting in London, today announced that when all of the figures were decided, the final sum to be awarded was not likely to be less than \u00a34.5m.</p> <p>At a recent hearing in Manchester, Ferguson said Collett, now 23, had an \"outstanding chance\" of becoming a full-time professional if he had not been injured. Collett joined United's youth academy aged nine and signed youth contracts, becoming part of the club's winning FA youth cup team in 2003. But aged 18, and in his first game for the reserves in May 2003, he had his right leg broken in two places in a tackle by Middlesbrough's Gary Smith.</p> <p>Smith and the club admitted liability for the \"negligent\" tackle and the judge's task was to decide on the level of compensation Collett should receive from Middlesbrough's insurers.</p> <p>Mrs Justice Swift said had it not been for the injury, Collett would have been offered a three-year professional contract with Manchester United in July 2003.</p> <p>In a statement read out at court, Jan Levinson, a partner at law firm Beachcroft, which represented Collett, said the size of the award reflected \"his talent and potential prior to the tackle as one of the brightest young footballers in the country\".</p> <p>Levison added: \"The judgment announced today is the highest award ever given to a professional sportsman or sportswoman. Thankfully, injuries of this severity are not a common occurrence on the football or any sporting pitch, so I do not see this successful claim opening the floodgates to litigious action by sportsmen.\"</p>",
  "<p>As Russian columns <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/11/georgia.russia3\">advance</a> into Georgia proper, columns in the American press fill with dire warnings and withering contempt for anyone so puerile as to ever trust a Russian. George Bush's infamous glimpse into Putin's soul failed to recognise what nostalgic cold warriors have always insisted was pinned to his sleeve: a heart that beats for lost imperial glory, and a ruthless ambition to match. Blogging at the Weekly Standard, John Noonan describes the Georgia conflict as the consequence of \"<a href=\"http://www.weeklystandard.com/Weblogs/TWSFP/TWSFPView.asp\">Chamberlain-esque conflict aversion</a>\". National Review's Jonah Goldberg cries <a href=\"http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MmUxYzA5ZjRiZjYxMzRiNTIyZTJmMTBkNDIwYWRlYjI=\">that</a> \"this is what happens\" when the west takes its eye off the Russians to enjoy the Olympics. </p> <p>\"This\", of course, is the brutalisation of a hapless, innocent, fledgling democracy \u2013 a role played to the hilt by Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili, who has spared no absurdity in his increasingly haggard efforts to trigger a western bailout of his hasty and ill-advised weekend invasion of long-autonomous <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article4485527.ece\">South Ossetia</a>. </p> <p>Saakashvili's overheated rhetoric \u2013 \"If the whole world does not stop Russia,\" <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/wtMostRead/idUSL768040420080808\">he has remarked</a>, \"then Russian tanks will be able to reach any other European capital\" \u2013 is illustrative of the kind of feverish thinking that is sure to transform a regional crisis into a global one. But where the frustrated desperation that Saakashvili has brought upon himself seems to explain his descent into hyperbole, American commentators have no such excuse. The real wake-up call placed by the Russo-Georgian conflict is not a clarion to a new cold war, but a head check for pro-democracy ideologues \u2013 whose idealism has ratified a style of sloppy thinking and rote sloganeering that actually threatens the durability of representative government around the world.</p> <p>The anti-Russia lobby is giving the pro-Israel lobby a run for its money, hyping the settling of scores among two European, Orthodox Christian countries as more dangerous to the peace and security of the west than any clash of civilisations or jihad ever was. Casting this conflict as a 9/11-style litmus test of patriotism and humanity, New Criterion editor <a href=\"http://pajamasmedia.com/rogerkimball/\">Roger Kimball</a> praises John McCain as a man who \"knows evil and repudiates it\", deriding Barack Obama as one \"crippled by moral relativism\" for daring to admit \"fault on both sides\". For Kimball, Russia, \"uncivilised\" as our terrorist enemies, affords the added menace of a disgruntled ex-superpower hell-bent on \"an imperialist mission\". Meanwhile, at Slate, Anne Applebaum <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/id/2197155/\">balefully warns</a> that Russia may make \"Islamic terrorism\" look like \"the least of our problems\". </p> <p>This will only come true if the west, in a paroxysm of fear and loathing, makes <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/11/russia.georgia\">an enemy of Russia</a> \u2013 which, indeed, would be a far more formidable foe than Iran, Hizbullah, and al-Qaida combined. No strategy against jihad can succeed with Russia aligned actively against the west. But no Russian official has expressed a desire to eradicate Georgia from the face of the earth, or drive the Georgian people into the sea. Nor are motives like these driving an illegal and destabilising Russian nuclear programme. Nor is our friendship with Georgia quite as deep and profound as our friendship with Israel. </p> <p>Despite moans of wishful outrage to the contrary, the small, democratic ally is not a Weberian ideal type or a Platonic form. <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/10/AR2008081002311.html?hpid=topnews\">Saakashvili</a> is a deeply imperfect leader, prone to beating his domestic opposition in the streets, and the Georgia he leads is a country that has been fragmented from birth. </p> <p>The anti-Russian reaction obscures the basic particularity of the Georgian situation, and all the history that informs it. These lost, sound judgment in pursuit of even a forthright agenda of assertive democracy promotion becomes impossible. Treating the Georgia we see on the map as if it were as sovereign and whole as the state of Israel, or Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, sets us down a path of danger and confusion. But the pro-democracy ideologues confusing big hearts for big brains make this mistake by design. </p> <p>The fact of the matter is that the territorial integrity of Georgia has been continuously undermined from within since the Abkhazians and South Ossetians first rebelled in the early 1990s. A central contention of the anti-Russian crowd holds that <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article4500362.ece\">Georgia today</a> would have been saved, if only the west had the courage to admit the country into Nato at once. But Nato membership was in large part imagined to smooth Georgia's reassertion of sovereignty in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. In short, the integrity of Nato was to be gambled on precisely the sort of move Saakashvili has just engineered to such catastrophic effect \u2013 and on the odds that Russia would abandon its citizens in those territories to frank and open aggression. How democratic.</p> <p>Another talking point advanced relentlessly by the anti-Russians proclaims, per Saakashvili, \"today Georgia, tomorrow the world\". The editors of the Washington Post have <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/08/AR2008080802741.html?hpid=opinionsbox1\">railed that</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>The principles at stake, including sovereignty and territorial integrity, apply well beyond the Caucasus. To abandon Georgia and its fragile democratic Rose Revolution would send a terrible signal to other former Soviet and Warsaw Pact republics that to Moscow's dismay have achieved or are working toward democracy and fully independent foreign policies. </p> </blockquote> <p>Would that these sacrosanct principles had applied to Serbia, which fought on just those grounds to keep Kosovo an integral part of its recognised territory. But the west recognised that European integration and American good faith would both have been profoundly damaged by stiffing the Kosovans; and in a sound calculation that combined realpolitik with democratic principle, Kosovo was recognised as an independent state of the sort that, soon, Russia will be recognising Abkhazia and Ossetia as. Indeed, it is hard to see how the Georgian taste for democracy is any weaker than the Kosovan, or how the fate of Abkhazia and Ossetia affects the fate of Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, or the Baltics \u2013 long-sovereign nation-states without ungovernable autonomous regions, and Nato members to boot. </p> <p>The fact remains that even if Russia were to squander its advantages and foolishly conquer all of Georgia, the consolidation of democratic, representative government on mainland Europe would be unaffected. American foreign policy, however, would not be. As much as we must work not to make an enemy of Russia, we cannot rule out the possibility that Russia, in its zeal to teach Georgia a lesson it will never forget, may be willing to risk making an enemy of America. Given the jingoism coming from American quarters, Russia enjoys, as is its wont, plausible grounds for appealing to the simple logic of tit for tat. </p> <p>The natural response is the firm but fair stance taken up by Barack Obama and the Bush administration \u2013 cognisant of the complex of blame in the Caucasus, but adamant that Russia not devastate Georgia without consequence. The alternative, typified by the anti-Russian caucus present within the McCain campaign and the American commentariat, is to romanticise Georgia and demonise Russia out of all proportion \u2013 not so dreadful, as election-year shenanigans go, but for the most imprudent and destructive policy that must follow upon it.</p>",
  "<p>Whether team GB hits its target of bringing home 41 medals from the Olympic games will depend on more than just the talent and hard work of the athletes. Winning at the top level also means having the most advanced kit and the best training strategies.</p> <p>In the run-up to the games ministers were keen to point out that the government had put far more money into elite sport compared with previous Olympics. Since 2004, top athletes and their coaches have received \u00a3265m, compared with \u00a384m ahead of the Athens games and \u00a363m before Sydney.</p> <p>Whether that will translate into more medals remains to be seen, but much of this money has gone into developing new technologies that should give British athletes the edge over the competition.</p> <h2>Training</h2> <p>Competitors will be eyeing up their rivals for advances in the equipment they use \u2013 more aerodynamic bikes, more powerful kayak paddles and the like. But many of the technological advantages will be invisible once the events start. </p> <p>\"The biggest gains are certainly in the training period,\" said Dr Scott Drawer, research and innovation consultant with UK Sport. He has been funding university scientists and companies to develop technologies that will allow coaches to assess the performance of their athletes more accurately and more quickly so that they can give more effective feedback. \"Developing measurement technologies to understand how people perform is an absolutely fundamental part of coaching,\" he said.</p> <p>His researchers have borrowed innovations from Formula One, aircraft design and the defence industry and have made a particular impact in kayaking, rowing and sailing. For example they have fitted miniature sensors to kayak paddles and rowing blades to measure the force applied in each stroke. That information can be combined with accurate data on the boat's speed from a GPS sensor.</p> <p>\"By putting all those sensors together you get a really accurate picture of how an individual is performing. You can then relay that information in real time to a coach ... and they can see, for example, what the athlete is doing and how they can change their technique,\" said Drawer. Much of the innovation has come in the software to combine the information in real time.</p> <h2>Diving</h2> <p>Another sport where new training aids could make a difference is diving. Previously, competitors practised new, more complicated dives over a trampoline. But the step up to doing it for real in the pool was a large one. Getting a new dive wrong could result in a belly-flop and a serious injury.</p> <p>To prevent this, researchers have developed a harness worn by the diver that is attached to the ceiling of the training pool. The harness gives them the freedom to perform twists and somersaults, but by holding the other end of the ropes the coach can control the diver's descent and slow them down if necessary. The harnesses have been used at elite diving centres in Sheffield, Southampton, Plymouth and Leeds.</p> <p>The harnesses were built by Dr Dave Richards, team leader in engineering design at Fraser Nash Consultancy. He said the device helps the athlete learn the feel of the dive more safely. \"It's for when you are first learning and you are trying to visualise what you are going to see,\" he said. \"It is to help the athlete learn orientation as they are doing the dive.\"</p> <p>The difficult part was fitting the harnesses. \"The challenge for us was putting them up in swimming pools that weren't designed to take them,\" he said. That meant using corrosion-proof, lightweight materials.</p> <h2>Heat adaptation</h2> <p>Although Beijing's 32C to 33C is positively balmy compared with the raging heat of Athens, adapting to the conditions is vital for athletes in every event. More difficult to deal with at these games is the 70% humidity which means that the body's natural mechanism of evaporative cooling via sweating is less effective. </p> <p>\"We are looking at other ways other than evaporative heat loss to remove heat from the body,\" said Prof Mike Tipton, an expert in human physiology at the University of Portsmouth who has been working with the Olympic team. </p> <p>At its most trivial this means pre-cooling kit, for example the protective clothing that fencing competitors wear during a bout, by putting it in a freezer. Other strategies include ice vests, cold hand baths and clothing containing cooled water or glycol. Another strategy is to help athletes acclimatise to the heat in advance by training in an environment that mimics the heat and humidity they will experience on the big day.</p> <p>Improvements in one aspect of a sport, for example reducing drag by changing the shape of a cycling helmet, might cause other problems, perhaps because the new design retains more heat. </p> <p>\"The aerodynamics, particularly in the cycling events and triathlon events, can make quite a significant difference to the amount of effort that's expended,\" said Tipton, \"but if the cost of that is that body temperature reaches the level at which heat exhaustion is likely then it is not a trade-off you are going to accept.\" Tipton has been involved in assessing other new equipment to check it will not affect the athletes' physiological performance.</p> <h2>Cycling</h2> <p>Team GB hopes to boost its cycling performance from the four medals won in Athens to six this time around. Most of the innovations to the bikes are top secret to stop other teams copying them. Only the competitors and a small group of engineers and scientists \u2013 whom Drawer calls the \"secret squirrels\" \u2013 know what they are.</p> <p>One training aid that has been revealed, though, is a more sophisticated cycling simulator or \"ergometer\" that can be more easily tailored to different cyclists to give a realistic ride while remaining stationary in the lab or in the training room. \"It is very adjustable to different people, but it also much better mimics the track cycling event,\" said Richards.</p> <p>The innovation was to include a large flywheel with a fan in it that mimics the change in resistance that a cyclist experiences during acceleration. Because the ergometer always reacts in the same way \u2013 unlike cycling on the track which might be affected by different air pressure or temperature \u2013 the cyclist and coach can accurately compare the effect of different training regimes or acceleration strategies.</p> <p>\u00b7 This article was amended on Tuesday August 12 2008.

  "<p>When I was a history student in the sixties some lecturer assured us that all the European empires of the modern era were crumbling fast with the exception of the two which had expanded across land, not sea: Russia and the United States.</p> <p>Leaving aside the reasonable speculation that the Chinese flag may one day fly over Hawaii, things haven't quite turned out that way for Russia, have they?</p> <p>To my great astonishment the Tsarist/Soviet empire fell rapidly apart after 1989. When Georgia seceded from the Soviet Union in the remarkable year of 1991 it was only the sixth item on the BBC TV evening news - itself a remarkable fact.</p> <p>What should the west do now that <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/11/georgia.russia7\">Russia is reasserting its revived power</a> on the periphery of its core state, the so-called \"near abroad\"? Reading the weekend press there is a pleasing - do I mean alarming? - disparity of views.</p> <p>The Telegraph flexes its cold war muscles and sounds hawkish. The Mail and Times chide the American-educated <a href=\" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikheil_Saakashvili \">Mikhail Saakashvili</a>, \"Rose Revolution\" president of Georgia since 2003, for his reckless belief that he could reassert his authority over South Ossetia without provoking the kind of Russian response we are now watching from afar.</p> <p>Did Moscow lure the excitable Saakashvili (he has been on the news channels a lot since Friday) into a trap, whereby it could consolidate its hold on South Ossetia and the other pro-Russian enclave of Abkhazia? Or was the Georgian advance a half-baked shambles in which Saakashvili had actually hoped to be at the Olympics like everyone else (except Gordon)? </p> <p>Today's Guardian runs a mix of opinion. <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/11/georgia.russia4 \">Jonathan Steele</a>, a specialist in this field for 40 years, dismisses the oil pipeline dimension as marginal (I'm inclined to agree, as I was over Iraq's oil) and puts the dispute in the wider context of US-led western efforts to reduce Russian influence throughout the region.</p> <p>Jonathan blames the \"hot-headed\" Saakashvili for over-reaching himself and thinking he has more claims on Nato and the EU's support in this far border corner of Europe and Asia than is warranted. Even George Bush urged \"peaceful resolution\" of Georgia's historic conflicts when he popped up in Tbilisi.</p> <p>Further into the paper, <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/11/russia.georgia\">David Clark</a>, a former adviser to Robin Cook, tilts the other way. Whatever his faults Saakashvili is no Milosevic (that's true) and deserves some diplomatic support. The west should sanction Putin's Russia - it's still Putin's, isn't it ? - if it tries to annexe sovereign territory, for instance by asking the IOC to reconsider nearby Sochi as a suitable base for the winter Olympics of 2014.</p> <p>The way I read <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/11/georgia.russia \">the paper's editorial</a>, it is more Steele than Clark. Russia has lost whatever moral high ground it had by bombing civilians and frightened its other \"near abroad\" neighbours, notably Ukraine, which has been squabbling with Moscow too and is well-placed to make trouble for the Russian Black Sea fleet if it is deployed.</p> <p>But the big loser is Saakashvili, whose EU critics - notably France and Germany - will now say they were right to resist UK-supported US pressure to admit Georgia to Nato and the EU. He speaks perfect English and, even making allowances for stress, I've learned not to trust all he says in the past few days.</p> <p>Myself, I've always had some sympathy with Russian complaints about being \"encircled\" by the US as Nato and the EU expanded into the former Soviet bloc. Eastern Europe, OK, those states were part of a Europe divided by the settlement of 1945. No one recognised the 1940 Soviet annexation of the Baltic states. </p> <p>But Russia's southern flank - the so-called \"stans\" - you could see why they felt humiliated and nervous. All that stuff about missile bases to cover Iran from Poland and the Czech Republic, oh really? </p> <p>On the other hand, neither camp in Fleet Street seems to dispute that the Russians have been stirring it up in the two enclaves for several years, moving in troops, shooting down drones and worse. So I am disinclined to see Russia and its Ossetian allies as mere victims of a foolish move from Tbilisi - Joe Stalin's birthplace, incidentally, in case anyone forgot.</p> <p>Will the Russians merely uphold the status quo, now the Georgians are pulling back? Will they organise a breakaway plebiscite, again using the anti-Serb, anti-Slav precedent of Kosovo since 1998 as their justification? Will they seek to use the inevitable backlash at home against Saakashvili to replace him with a more obliging local? </p> <p>What would the Yanks have done in their backyard, in Mexico or - more recently - in Haiti or (failed) Venezuela? It's worth asking, though it's also fair pointing out that abuses by US-backed states, Israel for example, get young westerners out on the streets in protest faster than abuses out of Asia. Think Lebanon, August 2006.</p> <p>My hunch is that, in its present assertive mood Moscow will risk pushing hard, not least to remind the west not to push too hard the other way. As in most such disputes - Iraq included - a mixture of motives, local and global, are in play. No one wants to miscalculate, this being the sort of crisis where \"Sarajevo 1914\" is more often invoked than \"Munich 1938\".</p> <p>But it's risky. Everyone feels nervous and a bit threatened. China's pyrotechnic Olympic opening ceremony - against which the Ossetian drama unfolded, confusingly at times (are they fireworks or rockets on TV?) - will not have made Moscow or Washington feel very relaxed this August. They have seen the future - and it works, at least when it comes to mass mobilisation.</p> <p>Many people seem to have adored the Beijing ceremony. I found it a bit scary, the sheer scale of it looking more like CGI images (those drummers?) than real-life Chinese at several points. By unhappy coincidence it all came in the week <a href=\" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Solzhenitsyn\">Alexander Solzhenitsyn</a> died which prompted the Economist to lecture us all - Russians, Chinese, liberal westerners - against being complacent towards tyranny.</p> <p>Where are the new generation of Solzhenitsyns among Russia's famed intelligentsia, it asked? Bought off by privileges, the comforts of revived nationalism and by flattery (so was Solzhenitsyn towards the end), it suggests. Ditto in China where new-found opportunities for free speech have not generated a more liberal regime. Is that fair? Several weekend reports suggest internal criticism of the vulgarity, chauvinism and cost of Friday's ceremony in the Bird's Nest stadium. Good.</p> <p>As for us, our collective willingness to speak truth to power against authoritarianism and abuse seems to atrophy gently as its moral clarity erodes. The product of affluence, the decline of a shared moral or religious code? Or am I being too pessimistic?</p>",
  "<p>The Conservatives today step up their campaign against lax bail policy by pledging to make the release of violent and persistent offenders more difficult - and make public safety a factor in all bail decisions.</p> <p>Amid concern about crimes committed by young men on bail, the shadow justice secretary, Nick Herbert, claimed that the average fine imposed on those who fail to answer their bail is \u00a360, the kind of sum levied for drunkenness or failing to pay the London congestion charge.</p> <p>\"The current system is not working - bail is too easily granted, frequently breached and improperly enforced,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Public confidence is undermined when bail conditions are routinely breached, offenders hold the criminal justice system in contempt and new victims of crime are created unnecessarily. It is time to tighten the bail laws and put public safety first.\"</p> <p>His policy document, Public Safety First, published today, demands a \"strong presumption\" against bail for those previously convicted of serious offences, people charged with murder, persistent offenders and suspects who have previously breached bail.</p> <p>Judges and magistrates would be allowed discretion in \"exceptional circumstances\"; government lawyers have warned ministers that any blanket bail ban would almost certainly fall foul of human rights law. </p> <p>Jack Straw, the justice secretary, is reviewing bail policy at Gordon Brown's instigation after a police inspector, Garry Weddell, killed his mother-in-law and himself while out on bail pending trial for killing his wife.</p> <p>The Tories would also seek to enforce bail terms more effectively. A new offence of bail breach, punishable by imprisonment, would be created, reinforced by magistrates and judges having more information on defendants' bail records. Tagging of potential risks and third-party bonds to cover sureties would also be introduced. No cost estimates are given.</p> <p>Current law enshrines a \"general right\" to bail except in specific circumstances, but concern has been voiced that 60 of the 450-plus murder suspects charged in 2008 were bailed after being charged. Four-fifths of violent crime suspects get bail - 65,000 against 14,000 held in custody - according to figures complied by the Conservatives.</p> <p>Measures to tighten up bail conditions and improve coordination in the system have already been adopted in Scotland.</p> <p>The Tory policy statement was designed to coincide with a memorial service this weekend to mark the first anniversary of Garry Newlove's murder. The father-of-three was kicked to death by three drunken teenagers, whose ringleader had been released on bail that day pending sentencing for assault. </p> <p>Straw was criticised at the weekend for a \"shocking lack of consultation\" over plans to open hundreds of bail units, to be run by private contractor Clear Springs, in residential areas.</p> <p>In an interview on the Today programme this morning, Sally O'Neill QC, chair of the criminal bar association, said she thought that although the Tory proposals sounded sensible, in practice they would not work in a way that was fair.</p> <p>\"The presumption of bail is one that is consistent with the presumption of innocence. Until someone has gone through the trial process, you have to assume that someone is innocent. There is no reason for an assuming, just because of what someone is charged with, that you remove any right to bail,\" she said.</p> <p>O'Neill said that suspects were granted bail on the assumption that they would attend court and not commit any offences before their trial. \"If there is a real fear of either of these happening, they will not be granted bail,\" she said.</p> <p>But Herbert told the programme that reform was necessary because figures suggested that one murder in six was committed by someone on bail.<br></p>",
  "<p>Open-ended <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/30/forensicscience.civilliberties\">DNA-taking</a> is a grievous instance of the malign drift of the Blair people's astonishing authoritarianism. This is the \"Let's see what we can get you for\" sort of policeman deciding who shall be listed as suspect potential. It's Kafka without the jokes. </p> <p>It is, however, only one of the ways in which legal practice has sleep-walked through a welter of liberal talk to authoritarian practice. Crime used to be a narrow field inhabited by a tight group of - well, criminals. It has since become the tag for a legion of regulation breakers and minor trespassers, its punishments visited upon defaults, failures to make declarations, forms unfilled-in, motoring offences - the acts of non-criminals.</p> <p>There used to be a sharp division in English law between crime and lesser acts. Crime was once, with beautiful clarity, defined as requiring an intent. Essentially it had two other unstated qualities to itself. Putting aside treason, crime had almost invariably to involve acts of violence or dishonesty. Dishonesty might once indeed have included acts not remotely criminal to us, like taking his Lordship's game or cutting turf on former common land. But the distinction is a good one.</p> <p>Theft, whether of shoes from a shop or the grand larceny of City of London fraud, is a clear and certain intended and criminal thing. We know where we are with it. Violence, from rape and murder through to blows injuring and meant to injure, is also sharply focused in the citizen's eye. It is something he naturally recognises as criminal. By no accident do the authorities now habitually use the weasel, stoat and ferret word: \"offence\". Crimes were committed by criminals, a very narrow group as common sense defined them. \"Offences\" are committed by \"offenders\" which means you who, for some footle, now have a criminal record and whose DNA must be taken.</p> <p>Government likes this sort of thing. It empowers government and its agencies. It threatens, bullies and above all, tabulates. Manifestly, failure properly to close the top of a refuse bin is <em>not</em> a crime, but in the Blairite world of meddling, finger-clicking legislators and policemen it has become one, part of an everlasting schedule of the acts and omissions of non-criminals. And when we have opened-up a five-lengths lead over every country in Europe in the numbers held in prison, stripping it back is a priority.</p> <p>One place to start, however much it goes against the progressive grain, is the motoring offence. Personally I favour low-powered cars like our Skoda, kept to a maximum of 50mph by my cautious wife. And I look upon <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Clarkson\">Clarkson</a> as an enemy of all civility. Even so, motorists driving too fast, driving after drinking too much or driving negligently should not go to prison. Further, the speeding/ drunken/negligent driver accidentally killing someone should not go to prison either. A terrible thing has happened but it was not intended to happen. The driver has not proposed an action and undertaken to carry it out. This person is not a criminal and no amount of a victim's distressed family calling for revenge will make him one.</p> <p>All such cases belong in the civil courts and the damages may be very heavy. But damages are not punishment, they are recompense. Government, however, trailing as it does after the mob press, wants to punish - wants, in the favourite terms of Charles Clarke and David Blunkett - to \"crack down\" and be seen cracking down. We have a criminal law led by headlines. We need a politician with the character and intelligence to eschew the punishment impulse, the power-hoarding impulse, the crowd-gratification impulse. </p> <p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_Grieve\">Dominic Grieve</a>, a seriously thoughtful shadow home secretary, might yet be heard from. Suppose the Tories took their wispy libertarianism seriously, suppose ... ? It 's only a thought but we haven't had much of <em>that</em> in criminal legislation lately.</p>",
  "<p>The hugely popular Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish has died, aged 67, after complications following heart surgery in the US. As candlelit vigils were held across Ramallah, Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas declared three days of national mourning and announced that he will receive the equivalent of a state funeral on Tuesday, an honour only previously accorded to PLO leader Yasser Arafat.</p> <p>Tributes from both literary and political figures poured in for the poet, whose work is taught in Palestinian schools and often touches on the themes of an oppressed and displaced people. </p> <p>\"He translated the pain of the Palestinians in a magical way. He made us cry and made us happy and shook our emotions,\" said Egypt's vernacular poet Ahmed Fouad Negm. \"Apart from being the poet of the Palestinian wound, which is hurting all Arabs and all honest people in the world, he is a master poet,\" Negm told Reuters in Cairo.</p> <p>French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said his country shared Palestinian admiration for \"this great figure whose poetry, which reflects nostalgia and liberty, speaks to us all.</p> <p>\"Mahmoud Darwish knew how to express the attachment of an entire people to its land and the absolute desire for peace. His message, which calls for coexistence, will continue to resonate and will eventually be heard,\" Kouchner said in a statement.</p> <p>The poet, born in territory now Israel, had made his home in the West Bank city since returning in the 1990s from a long exile during which he rose to prominence in Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO). \"The Palestinian question, in Mahmoud Darwish's poetry, was no longer a legend, but the story of people made of flesh, blood and feelings,\" said Zehi Wahbi, a friend of Darwish and a Lebanese television presenter and poet.</p> <p>Widely seen as the Palestinian national poet, Darwish's writing was much translated. Several of his books were translated into Hebrew, though the nationalist message of his work was largely shunned in Israel, where a plan in the 1990s to teach his poetry in state schools was quickly shelved.<br>Darwish won new generations of admirers with work that evoked not just the pain of Palestinians displaced, like him, by the foundation of Israel 60 years ago, but also subtle paradoxes and broader human themes.</p> <p>He enjoyed a following across the Arab world, where he had the kind of readership contemporary poets in English and other European languages, eclipsed by novelists, can only dream of. \"He turned the Palestinian cause into songs that transcended the cause and all other Arab issues,\" said Abdel-Rahman al-Abnoudi, a leading Egyptian poet and friend.</p> <p>As something close to national icon, he also helped to craft their 1988 declaration of independence. He penned the words Yasser Arafat spoke at the United Nations in 1974: \"Today I have come bearing an olive branch and a freedom fighter's gun. Do not let the olive branch fall from my hand.\" His longstanding importance to the PLO, however, soured after the interim peace accords that Arafat signed in 1993.</p> <p>Darwish's occasional readings in Ramallah drew huge crowds. His work was translated into more than 20 languages and he won numerous international awards. He first gained prominence in the 1960s with the publication of his first poetry collection, Bird without Wings. It included the poem \"Identity Card\" that defiantly spoke in the first person of an Arab man giving his identity number - a common practice among Palestinians when dealing with Israeli authorities and Arab governments - and vowing to return to his land.</p> <p>Many of his poems have been put into music - most notably \"Rita,\" \"Birds of Galilee\" and \"I yearn for my mother's bread\" - and have become anthems for at least two generations of Arabs.<br>He wrote another 21 collections, the last, \"The Impression of Butterflies,\" in 2008.</p> <p>In Cairo, Arab League chief Amr Moussa paid tribute to Darwish. \"With him gone, the Palestinians and all Arabs will be missing one of the poetic and cultural symbols in the modern history.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Bolivian president, Evo Morales, easily won a recall referendum last night and vowed to press ahead with plans to transform the country into a leftwing centralist state. </p> <p>Morales, a former coca leaf farmer who is Bolivia's first indigenous leader, hopes the victory will enable him to push through reforms including nationalisations, land redistribution and a constitution favouring the long-marginalised indigenous majority.</p> <p>\"What the Bolivian people have expressed with their votes \u2026 is the consolidation of change,\" Morales told thousands of cheering supporters who gathered outside his presidential palace in La Paz. </p> <p>\"We're here to move forward with the recovery of our natural resources, the consolidation of nationalisation and the state takeover of companies.\" </p> <p>Unofficial exit polls said Morales had secured 60-66% of the vote \u2013 an improvement on his result in the last presidential election, in December 2005, when he took nearly 54%. </p> <p>An exit poll by the private TV channel Unitel said Morales had won 60.12% of the vote, while a count by the pollster Ipsos Apoyo for channel ATB gave him 63.1%. Final official results are due in the next few days.</p> <p>However, last night's vote also saw the re-election of regional governors who oppose his reforms and want autonomy for their resource-rich provinces. Their victories mean the conflict over his proposals will continue, with both sides feeling they have won a new mandate to stand firm.</p> <p>Supporters of Morales and the main opposition governors alike took to the streets waving banners, chanting, dancing and setting off firecrackers after a peaceful vote that contrasted with violent protests earlier in the week. </p> <p>\"I'm glad he has won, because Mr Morales is one of us - he's working class like me,\" said Hector Gutierrez, a 32-year-old computer technician. </p> <p>\"I expect things to improve now, because someone from the same background as me cannot let me down.\" </p> <p>The bitter power struggle between Morales and opposition governors has exposed deep divisions between the wealthier east and the more indigenous west of the country, forcing him to put many reforms on hold. </p> <p>Morales approved the referendum in an apparent bid to undermine the regional governors' campaigns for autonomy, but the results suggest a standoff will continue unless a compromise can be negotiated. </p> <p>\"The initial reading is that the political crisis and tension in the country is going to deepen greatly,\" said Franklin Pareja, a professor of political science at the state-run San Andres University in La Paz. </p> <p>Regional governors are angry that Morales has cut their share of windfall natural gas revenues, accusing him of governing only for his supporters. </p> <p>They also see him as a lackey of the Venezuelan president, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, the vocal leader of a group of radical leftwing Latin American presidents.</p>",
  "<p>The ousted Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra skipped bail today and fled into exile in Britain claiming he could not get a fair trial on a raft of corruption charges because of political inference.</p> <p>Thaksin and his wife, Pojaman, who was sentenced to three years in jail for fraud two weeks ago, said they had gone to England with their family because they had received \"death threats\".</p> <p>The couple had been due to return from the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics to appear before the supreme court this morning to give evidence in a corruption case over a dubious land deal.</p> <p>In a hand-written statement given to Thailand's state broadcaster, Thaksin, 59, said he was travelling to England after failing to board a flight he had booked to take him back to Bangkok last night.</p> <p>No mention was made of seeking political asylum in Britain, where the former telecoms billionaire owns a lavish house. He spent most of his self-imposed exile in the UK after being deposed in the bloodless 2006 coup, buying Manchester City football club for \u00a381.6m in the process.</p> <p>Rumours were rife that the couple would flee Thailand after Pojaman, 51, was convicted of evading millions of pounds in taxes in connection with a 1997 shares transfer deal. Aides to the family emphatically scotched the suggestion.</p> <p>The day after Pojaman was sentenced along with her step-brother, Bhanapot Damapong, and former secretary, Kanchanpana Honghern, Thaksin left for a speaking engagement in Japan before travelling to China.</p> <p>Pojaman, her step-brother and former secretary boarded a flight for Beijing on Thursday to meet Thaksin. She left with nine suitcases and was given a tearful send-off at Bangkok's airport by her three children, son Phantongtae and daughters Pinthongta and Paethontan.</p> <p>Thaksin's children face several corruption allegations, but it was unclear if the reference to his \"family\" in his dramatic statement meant they too had travelled to Britain to escape the charges.</p> <p>The divisive former prime minister, who held office for five years, said he would remain in Britain indefinitely, but hoped he would be able to his homeland one day.</p> <p>\"My wife and I have travelled to reside in England,\" he said in the statement. \"If I still have luck, I would come back to die on Thai soil like every other Thai person.\"</p> <p>Five months after returning from exile to a hero's welcome, he railed that the Thai judicial system was stacked against him, despite his allies in the People Power party winning December's election.</p> <p>\"What happened to my family is like fruit from a poisonous tree - the fruit will also be poisoned,\" he said. \"There is a continuation of dictatorship managing Thai politics ... which is followed by interference in the justice system. These are my political enemies. They don't care about the rule of law, facts or internationally recognised due process.\"</p> <p>Thaksin is on bail of \u00a3120,000 and almost \u00a31bn of his assets are frozen in Thai bank accounts. A Thai court this morning ordered the arrest of Thaksin and his wife for failing to appear at today's hearing. He could face a trial in his absence.</p> <p>In the aftermath of the military coup, Thailand considered trying to extradite Thaksin under a bilateral treaty signed with Britain in 1911. Bangkok never filed a request because it was likely Thaksin could have claimed he was the victim of a political witch-hunt.</p>",
  "<p><em>Name? <br>Happy Liu. <br>On your ID card, it says your name's Hawa \u2013 how did Hawa turn into Happy? <br>I changed my name. Everyone calls me Happy Liu now.<br>\"Happy\" are you? Hawa Liu!<br>You've got to call me Happy Liu, comrade. <br>Happy Liu?! <br>Yes, sir!<br>You know why I'm handcuffing you? <br>Because of this dead body. <br>You'd better come clean then!<br>I shouldn't have been getting on the train carrying my friend's body.<br>Well, if you know that, why did you do it? <br>He had to go home. <br>Where's home? <br>Near Qingfeng Town in Shangzhou.<br>I'm asking about you! <br>Right here. I'm from Xi'an.<br>Uh?<br>I'm from Xi'an.<br>Really?! <br>Well, I should be from Xi'an. <br>Tell the truth! <br>I am telling the truth. <br>Then what do you mean by \"should be\"? <br>I really should be, comrade, because\u2026.</em></p> <p>It was 13th October 2000, and we were outside the barriers at Xi'an Railway Station East. The policeman was taking a statement from me.<br>It was blowing hard, and leaves floated down from the gingkos, catalpa and plane trees at the edge of the station square, covering everything with brilliant reds and yellows. The thing I'll always regret about that day is not the bottle of Taibai liquor, it's the white cockerel. In Qingfeng, where my friend Wufu and I came from, it was always said that if people died away from home, their spirit might get lost on the way back. So you had to take care to tie a white cockerel to the body. The cock was supposed to help Wufu's spirit get home but in the end it wrecked everything.</p> <p>The cock weighed two pounds, two and a half at most, but the woman selling it insisted it was three pounds. I lost my temper. \"That's rubbish!\" I said, \"I can tell you the weight of anything just by holding it!\" \"Do you know what I'm doing?\" I asked her. Of course, I didn't tell her what I was really up to. But the woman kept shouting: \"Put it on the scales again, you can put it on the scales again!\" so then the policeman stopped pacing up and down and came over.</p> <p>He only came to stop the argument, but he saw the roll of bedding tied with rope. \"What's that?\" He jabbed it with his baton. Noisy Shi went as pale as if he'd had a bag of ash emptied over his head. Then the stupid fucker opened his big mouth, and went and said it was a side of pork. \"Pork?\" went the policeman, \"You wrap pork up in a quilt?!\" He carried on poking and the corner of the bedding roll began to come undone. That was when Noisy Shi dropped the liquor bottle and scarpered. What a coward! The policeman immediately pounced like a tiger on me, and handcuffed one of my wrists to the flag staff.</p> <p>\"Could you handcuff my left wrist?\" I gave the policeman a smile. \"I pulled a tendon in my right arm digging ditches.\" </p> <p>This time, the baton jabbed me in the crotch, and when a man's jabbed in the crotch it goes numb. \"Don't joke around!\" So I didn't joke around.</p> <p>My eyes felt sticky, as if a lot of goo had suddenly come out of them, and everything looked blurred. But I didn't panic. I had to stay calm whatever happened. </p> <p>The ink wouldn't come out of the policeman's pen and he kept shaking it. The pimples on his neck had gone all red. I stretched out one foot towards the plane tree leaves that were floating down, but didn't step on them. I'd never seen a young man with so many teenage spots. He looked just like a young billy goat before it gets the snip, obviously far too young to be married!</p> <p>Click, click. Someone was taking photographs. </p> <p>That reporter was over 30 but she was dressed in little-girl clothes with a fringe to match. I took an instant dislike to her. I hadn't noticed when she took the first picture, but then I smoothed down my hair, and straightened my clothes, and presented my profile so she could take another. But the next day in the paper, they used the one with me half bent over, having my statement taken, with the flower-patterned bedding bundle tied up with rope in front of me. Wufu's foot was sticking out, and you could see the yellow plastic shoes stuffed with cotton wadding. Dammit, that picture was no better than an ID mugshot - full face, and ears showing. They make everyone look like a criminal. I've got a prominent nose and a well-defined mouth, but she wouldn't take me in profile, the bitch!</p> <p>That photo's not really me, it's not. No way\u2026..</p> <p>Once Wufu's body had been taken to the undertakers, they let me go. I had to go back to the station to wait for Wufu's wife, who was coming to take care of the funeral and so on, but there were lots of people in the station square looking at the newspaper, pointing at me and saying: \"Look! That's the man who tried to carry a corpse onto the train!\" They called out: \"Hawa Liu!\" but I ignored them. Then they shouted: \"Shangzhou chowmein-eater!\" In Shangzhou, where I come from, the land is so barren that last year's grain doesn't last till the next harvest, and at the Spring Festival, all there is to eat is fried noodles, which we make from persimmon mixed with rice husks. It was a pretty demeaning thing to call someone, so of course I paid even less attention. What I needed was time to have a good think. It occurred to me that Wufu's body had been taken to the undertakers, but his spirit must still be around here in the square, maybe perched on the traffic lights or sitting on the piles of roast chicken, hard-boiled duck eggs, steamed rolls and bottles of mineral water on the peddler's push-cart. I felt sore and tired now, and I pushed my hand against the small of my back. Then I had another thought: you judge a car by its engine, not by what it looks like. Well, wasn't a kidney a fundamental part of your body? My flesh was from Qingfeng, and was Hawa Liu, but I had sold my kidney in Xi'an, so that obviously meant I belonged in Xi'an. I really was from Xi'an! I was proud of myself for working this out. It made me feel a little bit alone, and also a little bit proud. I held my head high and began to stride along. And as each step rang out, it proclaimed: I'm not Hawa Liu. I'm not a Shangzhou chowmein-eater. I'm Happy Liu from Xi'an. HAP-PY LIU!</p> <p>When I first met my girlfriend Yichun, she said: \"Happy, you don't look like a peasant.\" I disagreed. \"Mutton never loses its muttony smell,\" I told her. But she said she had met a lot of people in Xi'an, and some of them were more like peasants than the officials, businessmen or professors they made themselves out to be. Her words went right to my heart. I always thought I was different from the people around me, at least different from my friend Wufu. I couldn't put this into words, but I knew I really was a cut above them.</p> <p>I can give you some examples: first, I'm really good at mental arithmetic. When I had to do maths as a little boy, I could give you the answers without having to work out the sums on paper first, even if they were three- or four-figure numbers. Of course I had my own ways of working them out, but I didn't tell anyone. Second, I'd walk ten miles, and go hungry too, to get to a show in the county town. Third, my clothes are old, it's true, but they're always clean. I don't have an iron, but I pour boiling water into my enamel tea mug and use the bottom to iron the creases into my trousers. Fourth, I can play the flute. In Qingfeng, lots of people could play the Chinese violin, but only I played the flute. Fifth, if I have a problem, I don't tell anyone about it. If it gets really bad, I just make a joke against myself, and have a laugh, and that's it. Six, I hate foul-mouthed people. What have you got against heaven? What have you got against your parents? What's the point of cursing them? The man who bought my kidney off me said it was going to a big Xi'an businessman, so he had to check I didn't have any other diseases. Go ahead, I said, and the only thing he found was haemorrhoids. I was putting on weight, he said, and like the classic Chinese essay, \"the form wandered a bit even though the spirit was sharp and to the point\". I got annoyed at that, but not for long, and when he left I gave him a basket of pullets' eggs. Seven, I was born with upturned lips, so I'm happy by nature. Four years ago, when Mother Wang was looking for a wife for me, I played the flute for three days and three nights. Mother Wang had said I had to build a new house, so to raise the money, I sold my blood. I did this three times, until I heard that people from Dawanggou had caught Hepatitis B from selling their blood, so I didn't do that again, I sold my kidney instead. I used the money to build the house, but then the girl went and married someone else. OK, so she married someone else. I still played the flute for three days and nights, and then I went out and bought a pair of women's leather high-heeled shoes with pointed toes. \"You bunion!\" I said. \"I'm going to marry a woman who wears leather high-heeled shoes with pointed toes!\" </p> <p>And of course a woman who can wear leather high-heeled shoes with pointed toes must be a city girl from Xi'an. </p> <p>I can't explain why I have such strong feelings for Xi'an! After I had sold my kidney, I had several dreams about Xi'an - its city walls, the archways and their solid wooden gates, the studs as big as rice bowls on them, and the bell tower with its gilded roof. In my dream I was sitting on a white rock under a crook-necked pine outside the city walls. When I arrived in Xi'an, the gates in the city walls and the bell tower were exactly as I'd dreamed them, and outside the walls there really was a crook-necked pine tree with a white rock under it. That made me ask myself a few questions: why was I never physically strong enough? Wufu could wade a river waist-deep in water with a load of firewood weighing 150 pounds on his back. Why couldn't I? Wufu could eat ten pounds of cooked sweet potato in one sitting, so why did I burp acid after I'd eaten three pounds? Wufu was such a dope, but he married ages ago and had kids, so how come I was still a bachelor? What was the reason? The reason was that I was going to be a city man, from Xi'an!</p> <p><strong>About the author</strong></p> <p>A career which combines popularity and critical respect is perhaps a writer's holy grail. Ever since the publication in 1993 of his first novel The Chinese author Jia Pingwa has added controversy to the mix. </p> <p>A racy story which follows a middle-aged idler, Feidu (Defunct Capital), was banned in China after publication, but not before becoming a major bestseller. It was the first of a series of novels about life in Shaanxi Province, where Jia was born, which struggle with the transformations sweeping through contemporary China, and the changing relationship between city and countryside. These novels have made him one of China's most successful authors, where he is regularly cited as one of the country's top-earning writers. </p> <p>Born in 1953, Jia worked on the family farm before studying in the Chinese department of the Northwestern University in Xi'an and publishing a number of award-winning short stories and novellas in the 1970s and 1980s. </p> <p>His latest novel, Happy (Gaoxing ) had a first print run of 300,000 on its publication last year, and is now being made into a film.

  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Preamble</strong> Bonjour. The small fourth-innings chase is one of cricket's more fascinating elements. At the best of times sport is perhaps 10% talent and 90% mind \u2013 were it the other way round Mark Ramprakash would have 11,023 runs @ 45.62 from 17 years of Test cricket \u2013 but in these situations that balance moves even further towards it being a mind game. When you are chasing under 200, with time no object, you know you will win nine times out of 10 (or four times if you're Australian) but you know that the tenth instance will cause embarrassment, humiliation and, as Thom Yorke once said, bruises that won't heal.</p> <p>Basically, you've done the hard work. You've engaged that attractive lady/boy with an opening line that's nowhere near as good as you think it is; you've made your job and indeed yourself sound ten times more interesting than they are, perhaps hinting tantalisingly at a fascinating ocean of melancholy just beneath the surface; with the aid of umpteen snifters of Strong Drink, you've held eye contact for at least 0.01 seconds longer than would be appropriate in a less sexually charged environment; you've only gone and got that ladyboy to invite you back to theirs!</p> <p>And now you can only Costanza it. You can only say, no thanks, you don't like coffee at this hour because it keeps you awake; you can only say something wildly inappropriate about tranvestisism, not knowing that their father has only just this last week undergone the change; you can only mispronounce Leffe as 'Leff-ay' and find out that, with the exception of George Lamb, this annoys them more than anything else in the entire world; you can only struggle miserably with that strap; you can only inexplicably confuse the word 'prophylactic' with 'ptedoractyl' when asking them if they have protection; you can only be told the taxi is on its way.</p> <p>It's a whole different kind of pressure, basically, and to blow it can be damaging stuff. Same goes for the fourth-innings collapse, which can impact upon a player, a generation of players, or even an entire sporting nation. Australia would not rid themselves of <a href=\"http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/statsguru/engine/match/63291.html\">Headingley 81</a> for over a quarter of a century, until Shane Warne decided to remake The Exorcist as an arthouse sport movie; Damien Martyn did not play another Test for six years after slapping one to cover in <a href=\"http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/statsguru/engine/match/63629.html\">Sydney 94</a>; England have been going in one direction since the unfathomable horror of <a href=\"http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/statsguru/engine/match/225443.html\">Multan 05</a> when, having played with the most splendid authority for four days in the first post-Ashes Test, they fell in a heap on the final day. It was a result that at the time felt like a blip but was actually the beginning of the end.</p> <p>That was actually one of only two occasions in the last 30 years in which England have lost when chasing a fourth-innings total of under 200 (by way of comparison Australia have failed eight times in the same time) but both, like today's involved a target in the nervous 190s: in the other, in Trinidad in 1993-94, they didn't even make <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmMn4bhi-KU\">a quarter of the target of 94</a>. By rights they really should win today on a pitch that apparently remains largely blameless: but in the fourth innings of a Test, as in the third part of a horror trilogy, all bets are off.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Don't pick your nose, at least not in public.

I say deliver me from Swedish furniture.</p> <p>Meanwhile, here's an email.</p> <p>\"I've a feeling that if Strauss goes early, MP Vaughan will be on the plane to India, but if Strauss hangs around for 60-odd, I can't see Vaughan having enough cricket to build his case for a tour. England surely won't take Vaughan and Strauss to India - it would be Gatting and Gooch to Aus all over again.\" The combined ages are slightly different - 77 to 64 from memory, and one of them can be hidden in the slips this time - but I take your point. For me it has to be Vaughan: better player and complements Cook perfectly, both as right-hander and initiative-seizer.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>Another link</strong> James Dart and Scott 'Dulux' Murray have a book coming out based on the weekly column, <a href=\"http://www.guardianbooks.co.uk/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/product_10401_25501_132806_100_38603_38603_category_\">the Knowledge</a>, which, if it's anywhere near as good as said column, should be well worth some of your beer tokens.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>2nd over: England 4-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 0, Cook 4)</strong> It's Ntini to finish the over he began yesterday evening, and Cook pulls him with crisp authority for four. Nice shot. I like the way Cook is moving his game on ever so slowly: in this series his strike rate in Tests is, I believe, behind only those of Broad, Bell and Pietersen, and he is pulling more often and with more class.</p> <p>Steve Hudson is on something, and I like it. \"Sir Geoffrey Boycott was mesmerising yesterday on TMS. Balanced, courteous, incisive, succinct, charitable: he was none of these things, but compulsive listening nevertheless. It's sounding more and more like a drunk driving a car with Aggers and Polly as passengers in the back, trying to grab the keys, on the verge of screaming for it all to end. Pin your ears back today.\" I won't heard a bad word against Boycott. I'll hear <em>the</em> bad word against him, but not <em>a</em> bad word.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>3rd over: England 5-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 0, Cook 4)</strong><br>Strauss has pared his game to a ludicrous degree. He only had three shots in the first place, but watching a DVD of the 04-05 tour of South Africa reminds you how outstandingly well he played then. He was absolutely be<em>la</em>bouring the short ball. Now he is a just a sub-Tavare blocker, like a mute who has started editing his thoughts so rigorously that he never shares them. He can't be accommodated any longer in my opinion. In that over he edges Morkel just short of Harris at fourth slip.</p> <p>Here's Ian Copestake. \"Could this the day that will be remembered henceforth by all South Africans as Harris's day, or H-day if you're into the whole brevity thing?\" That's just, like, your opinion man. Actually I am still wondering how Harris managed to hoover up so many wickets against Pakistan. If it was in Salim Malik's day it would make perfect sense, but not now.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>4th over: England 5-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 0, Cook 4)</strong> This is Cook's 33rd Test, and it's hard to think of many players - Trescothick is one; Strauss maybe - who have played as many Tests without being dropped. But not many others. In that over he reaches to drive a wider, fuller delivery from Ntini and is beaten. Smart bowling, that, and it's a maiden.</p> <p>\"Boycott has actually turning in some high quality anti-establishment rhetoric on TMS during the last two ot three Tests,\" says Stephen Wolstencroft. \"He gave the Iraq war a proper seeing to the other week, and yesterday he was decrying the materialistic nature of the modern capitalist world, spurred on by the sudden influx of Sky money into cricket. Pop him in some sandals and hand him a bowl of lentils and he could pass for a Guardianista.\" Does he cheques from the folks as well?</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>5th over: England 9-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 4, Cook 4)</strong> Strauss looks horrible here. He's hardly playing a shot and, when he's forced to by a straight, short one from Morkel, he can only loop it straight to where silly point would have been. But he gets off the mark later in the over, working a straight one off his pads through midwicket. Good shot.</p> <p>A wee thought: in an age of a) rotation and b) enlightened attitudes to mental fragility, should England invite Trescothick to play in home Tests only? I'm starting to think that maybe they should, if only for the sake of my sanity.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>6th over: England 9-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 4, Cook 4)</strong> Maiden from Ntini. In other news, Paul McMillan shuts me up armed with nothing other than a keen love of statistics and a Cricinfo bookmark. \"Cook's strike rate is 44.6, which is also slower than Collingwood, Harmison and <br>Flintoff. Or in other words the 3rd slowest in the top 9, behind only <br>the soon to be dropped Strauss and Ambrose.\" Ok, so maybe it's this calendar year? I definitely checked it the other day; either that or I dreamt it, the implications of which I don't want to consider in public.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>7th over: England 9-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 4, Cook 4)</strong> Strauss does well to leave a big short ball from Morkel. No real threats to England this morning, but the problem with these two is that they can bat for an hour and you've not really gone anywhere. <br> <br>\"I have been advocating the Tresco thing ever since they picked Pattinson - if we are going for special selections, why not bring Banger in for the Ashes series?\" says Rachel Clifton. \"I saw him at Lords the other day and he was looking as good as ever.\" The first thing is that it'll never happen, but I do think it's something that should be considered. Why should his illness be any different to a player who, coincidentally, gets injured before every winter tour? You just get prior warning with this. The key is that you accept cricket is now a squad game rather than a team game. But Geoff Miller said recently he doesn't like the word 'rotation'. This after he had just rotated Paul Collingwood out of the team.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>8th over: England 9-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 4, Cook 4)</strong> Cook is done by the Ntini angle again, pushing at and missing a slightly wider length delivery. The next ball keeps a bit lower, and there is just a hint of uneven bounce - but, as Mike Atherton points out, nothing much more than you'd expect on a fifth-day track. Another maiden.</p> <p>\"Boycs' rant on Stamp and Death Duties was a joy to behold last week. He really got stuck into it,\" says Tom Walling. \"I'd like to see him on Newsnight, alongside Paxman, as a summariser. He'd cut through the rubbish. 'My Gran could run this country better than Brown, and she'd do it with a cucumber.' Or is that a Carry On film?\" Boycott ooh-matroning his way through a Carry On film really would be something to behold.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>9th over: England 10-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 4, Cook 4)</strong> Strauss is caught off a no-ball! He turned Morkel straight round the corner to the man at leg gully, but Morkel had overstepped by a fair distance. Sickeners come a little more definitive, but not that much.</p> <p>\"It's not exactly the same thing but Dennis Bergkamp's fear of flying meant he was available solely for the home leg of most European matches for Arsenal, which was widely accepted as he was good enough to justify his presence,\" says Michael Hunt, not unreasonably.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>10th over: England 10-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 4, Cook 4)</strong> <br>Wars of attrition can be as enriching as anything in sport. This, it's fair to say, isn't. But England are struggling a little, and Cook is beaten as he has a leaden-footed grope at Ntini. You can arrested for that in some cultures. \"Can these two hang on for the draw do you reckon?\" honks Dave Voss.</p> <p>In lieu of any action, the Sky team are extracting the stuff out of Nasser for his preposterous dismissal against Ntini in 2003, when he flap-hooked him straight up in the air with one foot daintily off the ground.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>11th over: England 11-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 4, Cook 4)</strong> <br>I think this game still has a pulse, but it's not easy to discern. Morkel. Strauss. Maiden. The other thing is that the weather is by no means to hold; it's a bit funky overhead.</p> <p>Luciano Howard utters the Banned Word: 'Adelaide'. But this <em>is</em> similar, even if the context isn't. England learnt nothing from that day and, if anything, have gone further into their shell since.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>12th over: England 20-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 4, Cook 12)</strong> <br>Cook crunches Ntini down the ground for four - he didn't time it particularly well, but that's our quota of runs for the next four overs, so enjoy them; cherish them; <em>love</em> them. Actually there are four more, pulled away beautifully through midwicket off a no-ball. It's a feast!</p> <p>\"Unfortunately,\" says Andy Bradshaw, \"CMJ was saying the other day that Trescothick didn't want to play for England full stop.\" Ah. Case closed, Columbo.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>13th over: England 26-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 5, Cook 16)</strong><br>Morkel is joint top wicket-taker in this series with 15, yet by common consensus he can bowl a lot better. He certainly bowls some utter dross at times, and the first ball of that over, around the wicket to Strauss, is the widest of wides. Strauss then turns one round the corner: he now has 5 from 40 balls. Michael Slater, cry your heart out. Cook then pulls for four; he plays that short so very, very well.</p> <p>\"Bad luck Smyth. Looks like the quicker-scoring Cook is to remain a feature only of your nocturnal imaginings,\" mwah-ha-hahs Tom Lawrence. \"Cook's strike rate for matches starting in 2008: 45.09, behind Harmison, Pietersen, Broad, Bell, Flintoff and Collingwood, and ahead of Ambrose, Strauss, Vaughan and the rest of the bowlers.\"</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>14th over: England 33-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 12, Cook 16)</strong> Ntini beats Strauss with a gem, a trampolining leg-cutter that just missed the edge of his tentative push. Strauss then plays a very nice shot, driving Ntini pleasantly down the ground for four. He then tucks three more off his pads. It hasn't great to watch, at all, but England are slowly grinding their way into a position of control. Time for a bit of bluster and bull from Andre Nel, I think.</p> <p>\"Surely Harmison should only play home Tests too?\" says Chris Bowden. \"His newfound confidence is likely to be destroyed if he leaves the comforts (sic) of Durham and tours India, and he would risk being dropped for the Ashes.\" You say that, but Harmison actually has a splendid record on the subcontinent, where he has consistently showed an admirable willingness to get his hands dirty. Absurdly, it's in overseas conditions that should favour him - Africa and Australasia - where he has bowled like a drain. His is a much more complex case than many people think.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>15th over: England 39-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 13, Cook 17)</strong><br>South Africa do make a change, but it's Harris rather than Nel or Kallis. The first ball does turn (out of the rough, obviously), but if Harris bowls South Africa to victory today I'll eat my own toenail clippings. Strauss sweeps for one, and then Harris beats Cook and Boucher and England get four byes.</p> <p>\"Afternoon Rob,\" chirps unofficial Laphroaig taster Ian Taylor. \"This Thursday, after 7\u00bd years' selfless mediocrity, I'll be leaving my current employers for pastures new. Since you've left the Guardian on about 37 occasions in the last four years I wonder if you, or any of you readers, have any tips and suggestions as to how to go out in style?\"</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>16th over: England 48-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 13, Cook 26)</strong> Ntini, indefatigability incarnate even at the age of 78, continues to hustle in, and his first ball, slanted across Cook, zips past his attempted drive. Smart bowling. Cook gets some bat on it later in the over, though, steering successive deliveries to the fence at third man. This is an over too many, even for Ntini.</p> <p>\"Where did the phrase 'bowled like a drain' originate?\" asks Sam Blackledge. \"Maybe we will see an unexpected call up for a top of the range sewage system from Nottinghamshire...\" I thought we did two Tests ago?</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>Drinks-break chitter-chatter</strong> <br>\"Is the talent deficit between Rolf and the rest of the SA team about as great a gulf as there has been in cricket?\" says Gary Naylor. \"Reading your colleague Jonathan Wilson's excellent book on the history of football tactics last night, I was reminded of the sensational Brazil 1982 team of Socrates, Eder, Zico etc. Up front, they had the lumbering Serginho - football's Rolf. However, I can't think of any examples from cricket to compare with Ringo, sorry Rolf.\"</p> <p>In football, I'd like to offer the lumbering fool known as Jonathan O'Shea. In cricket, probably not among the regular picks (there are one- or few-cap wonders like Scott Muller, Clybe Butts). Some would say Roger Harper, but he was a half-decent spinner, not to mention the greatest fielder of all-time.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>17th over: England 54-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 13, Cook 31)</strong> <br>\"Catch it\" shouts Harris, as Cook puts him miles away from any fielder and through midwicket for four. Harris really is a total nonentity.</p> <p>\"I have plenty of suggestions as to how Mr Taylor can go out in style, but they would be wasted on a man who cannot manage an evening of drinking without wrecking a perfectly innocent pair of suit trousers,\" says Richard O'Hagan. \"Frankly, the best I can do is to recommend that he avoids his own leaving do like the plague.\"</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>18th over: England 59-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 18, Cook 31)</strong> <br>Nel is on for Ntini, and Strauss leaves, leaves, leaves - and then tucks one off his pads for a single. Five, in fact, because Amla's unnecessary throw fies away for four overthrows.</p> <p>Iain McCulloch is getting feisty. \"SJ Harmison's 'splendid record in the sub-continent' amounts to 23 wickets at 34.65. I think you should stop eating a whole Stilton before you turn in of an evening, these statistic dreams are becoming ever more extreme.\" You want some McCulloch? A) That's a decent record for a seam bowler on the subcontinent. B) It's a very decent record for a seam bowler who's perceived to be a shi*house on the subcontinent. C) He has bowled better than those figures suggest. Next!</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>19th over: England 63-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 21, Cook 32)</strong> Harris is certainly getting it to rag out of the rough, but you suspect that nobody on either side really believes he is going to take wickets, and that makes a huge difference. Shane Warne could turn it exactly the same amount and end up with a six-for. Anyway, Strauss tickles one to third man for three.</p> <p>\"Surely,\" says Paul Roberts, \"Mike Brearley and the rest of his England team would be an example of a pretty large talent gap?\" He would, but only if you see cricket as a two-dimensional game.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>20th over: England 69-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 21, Cook 38)</strong><br>Brainlessly short from Nel, and Cook dumps him through midwicket for four with a real flourish. I think the word is 'Shot!'. England are now cruising towards their first dead-rubber victory in the final Test of the home summer since 1997, a Test best known, of course, for being the last of Digger Martin's career.</p> <p>\"I suggest that Ian Taylor puts on 'Simply The Best', does a lap of honour around the office, high-fiving each and every staff member before waving goodbye at the door with the words 'I've been Ian Taylor - you've been the best',\" says Sam Blackledge. \"Or has that been done before?\"</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>21st over: England 72-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 21, Cook 38)</strong><br>Strauss takes a dodgy single off Harris but Prince at square leg lets Cook off with a preposterously naff throw that Mark Boucher does well to stop. Cook then fresh-airs a hoick that goes through everyone and away for two byes. What's the chorus of that British Sea Power song 'No Lucifer' again?</p> <p>\"Harris reminds me of our old science teacher at school. He used to coach the cricket team as well, and when we were in the nets he's bowl his brand of off spin that everyone would clatter around,\" says Alistair Stewart. \"He'd then inform us that we'd have hit it straight at the fielder he'd have placed in anticipation of being hit a mile over his head.\"</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>22nd over: England 77-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 23, Cook 42)</strong> Another frankly regal pull stroke from Cook for four, although it's staggeringly witless bowling from Nel. Someone give Gunther one of those little 'Logic Problems' books to get his brain working again, please.</p> <p>\"Could you please explain to a newbie the Mike Brearley comment?\" says Andrew Hulbert. \"Do I infer correctly that he was a mediocre cricketer but did something else worthwhile?\" He was, perhaps, the greatest captain of all time - he had, as the Aussie fast bowler Rodney Hogg put it, \"a degree in people\". He was certainly in the top 10, so that more than made up for his modest batting.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>23rd over: England 80-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 24, Cook 44)</strong> <br>England continue to prove that you can also milk a dog, taking three from Harris's over.<br> <br>\"The constant criticism of Harris from all quarters puzzles me. He is SA's Ashley Giles - bats well and does a job with the ball (keeps it tight whilst the seamers rotate),\" says David Smeath. \"He's no Shane Warne but he's no worse than countless other Test spinners over the years - remember Ian Salisbury!\" True, but there are differences: Giles was a significantly better batsman, for one, and he won a few Tests outside the subcontinent, most notably in 2004. What Harris does do, as you say, is generally keep it genuinely tight (his Test economy rate is an excellent 2.68) while the four seamers get their break. But in situations like this he's about as useful as Special Slapheads Shampoo.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>24th over: England 90-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 25, Cook 53)</strong> <br>Kallis, who has arguably had his series with the ball since they toured West Indies in 2000-01, comes into the attack. But he makes the mistake of bowling short to Cook, who slaps him through the covers off the back foot to reach a very fine fifty, with 10 fours (mostly thumping pull shots) and from 83 balls. It'd be nice if he could get his first century of the summer today.</p> <p>Iain McCulloch is back, armed with a thesaurus and a broadband connection. \"Smyth, there doesn't seem to be any need to get in an argument \u2013 quoting one fairly ambiguous stat made you downgrade your rating of Harmy in Asia from 'splendid' to 'decent'. If I leave you to your own devices you'll eventually run the gamut through 'middling' and 'patchy' to 'sub-standard' all by yourself. Next!\" Ah but I said his record was decent and his actual bowling (and attitude) splendid. These things are relative, in view of the conditions and perceptions as to how he will performs. Also, YOU RELEASED 'NOTHING LASTS FOREVER'. Next?</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>25th over: England 95-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 29, Cook 53)</strong> <br>No threat from Harris, although that doesn't stop Harrus putting his hands in the air like he just don't care after every ball. Strauss comes down the track and screws him through midwicket for four more.</p> <p>Talking of which. \"Does Harris throwing his arms up in the air after every delivery annoy anyone else as much as me?\" says Zac Aldridge, knowing full well the answer. \"He's never going to convince anyone that he can turn the ball.\"</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>26th over: England 100-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 32, Cook 55)</strong> <br>England are past halfway, and now past 100. It's all over bar the dawdling, but the next 90 runs might have great significance for Michael Vaughan's future. If Strauss is, say, 65 not out he will be hard to drop, as Gary Naylor pointed out earlier.</p> <p>Here's Tom Lawrence. \"<a href=\"http://stats.cricinfo.com/statsguru/engine/stats/index.html?bowling_pacespin=1;class=1;filter=advanced;home_or_away=2;opposition=6;opposition=7;opposition=8;orderby=bowling_average;spanmax1=11+Aug+2008;spanmin1=11+Aug+1998;spanval1=span;team=1;template=results;type=bowling\">This link</a> below displays pace bowling stats for the last ten years for England playing away Test matches against India, Pakistan or Sri Lanka.

They should give his match fee to charity, or JD Wetherspoons, and play with 10 men. Frankly, South Africa look like they couldn't give one anymore, and why should they? I wonder what percentage of dead rubbers are won by the side that has lost the series. I bet it's ludicrously high in view of the fact that the side that lost the series is invariably, intrinsically inferior.</p> <p>Here's Raja Dasgupta. \"Re: David Smeath's comment in the 23rd Over ('The constant criticism of Harris from all quarters puzzles me. He is SA's Ashley Giles') - does this count as damning with faint praise, or just damning.\"</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>28th over: England 109-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 38, Cook 58)</strong> <br>Morkel goes past the outside edge of Strauss, the first time that has happened in a while. But England are scoring at a steady rate now, gobbling up runs like Pac-Man does those things he gobbles up. </p> <p>Nick Evans exposes cricket journos for the idiots they are shocker. \"Is it just me or has the coverage of this series focused on the SA batsmen 'booking in for bed and breakfast', and ours batting like carefree ne'er-do-wells who sneak out of a bedroom window at 7am minus half their clothing? Yes Strauss is a far less attractive batsman than in 05, but if Cooky is by all accounts playing a few more shots, surely that should be a nice balance with Strauss leaving everything outside off, boring the bowlers into bowling at the stumps a la McKenzie?\" </p> <p>I think you need one initiative-seizer of an opener: Smith does it for South Africa; Cook isn't ready to do that yet, and ideally should be allowed to develop in his own bubble. In terms of the whole series, I think South Africa have just played the context very well - coincidentally, most of the time it has demanded an accumulative approach - whereas England seem to have one approach regardless of the context.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>29th over: England 109-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 38, Cook 58)</strong><br>What England have done well this morning is use their feet against Harris. There was a 0.00000001 per cent chance that he would settle into a groove and bowl them out on a fifth-day pitch. They took away that chance by not allowing him to settle through positive foot movement (is there any other kind?) and the resulting shots. </p> <p>Iain McCulloch's back for more. \"Darren Gough's sub-continental record is 24 wickets @ 22.58. Now that is splendid. But I'd love to hear your thoughts on his attitude and everything else, cos that's obviously more relevant. And 'Nothing Lasts Forever' reached number 8.00 in the charts, another splendid record.\" Yes, and Darren Gough was world-class whereas Steve Harmison is simply very good. Plus Gough reverse-swings it, which is a huge weapon to have on the subcontinent. Plus Gough's attitude was never questioned, so in mentioning attitude you are being deliberate disingenuous. That's naughty. Bad boy. Naughty boy. Your second point I won't even dignify with a response.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>That's lunch</strong> After a soul-sappingly slow start, Strauss and in particular Cook took complete control against a South African side who left their hearts in San Francheesy, or at least the Edgbaston dressing-room. See you in 30 minutes.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>\"Lunch is... lunch is difficult\"</strong> So says the brilliant Brain in the film Brick. And he's right. When you've only got 40 minutes between OBO sessions, lunch can be difficult. Especially when the nearby Sainsbury's has a queue of about 431 people, all spending their daily cheque from the parents on \u00a35 salad leaves and Fairtrade Tic-Tacs.</p> <p>Anyway, the players should be back on in a bit, and sometime around 3.15pm England will be getting ever so slightly giddy on the smell of dead rubber. It's legal, you know.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>Lunchtime chat</strong> \"Losing the last Test in a dead rubber depends on the nature of the team, surely,\" says Pete Gay. \"I don't remember tGarner, Holding and co going to sleep in the last mach of a series or, for that matter, the Australians recently. Both those teams were quite happy to rub the opposition's noses in it as hard as they could.\" True with Waugh's Australia, but Taylor's were renowned for it, and even Waugh's did it on occasion: South Africa 2001-02, the Ashes 2002-03. West Indies had a couple as well, most notably - and absurdly - at the hands of Murray Bennett, Bob Holland and Allan Border in 1984-85 and 1988-89.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>30th over: England 115-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 38, Cook 63)</strong> <br>Ntini begins after lunch in what might just be his final spell on these shores. He's been a trooper and all, but I worry about him if he plays in Australia in a few months' time. He will go <em>every</em>where. Anyhoo, in that over he has a big shout for LBW against Strauss, but it obviously pitched outside leg, even to the naked eye. Cook then pushes him blissfully straight for four.</p> <p>\"I have no telly here but I do have windows and its hammering down,\" says Chris Miller. \"Where's the rain? I have money on a draw...\" Don't know how to break this, Chris, but the weather <em>isn't the same all round the world</em>?</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>31th over: England 119-0 (chasing 197, Strauss 42, Cook 63)</strong><br>The man who won the little-known South African reality TV show, How Do You Solve A Problem Like Tayfield?, continues to bowl to absolutely no effect whatsoever. Strauss works one round the corner for a couple. This presents a really interesting selection problem, because they won't have the stones to drop Strauss now that he has made one whole fifty in the series. So that means - if we work on the not unreasonable assumption that five bowlers are back for the forseeable future - that there is probably only room for one of Vaughan, Bopara and Shah in the squad to tour India.</p> <p>\"Have you got my Starship CD?\" writes one of OBO's finest, Sam Collins. \"I can't find it anywhere.\" No I haven't, Collins, you sick fool.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 123-1 (Cook c Smith b Ntini 67)</strong><br>Cook fails in the sixties for the seventh time in the last year. The ball after pulling another blistering boundary, he drove at a full delivery from Ntini that left him just enough to take the edge and went straight into the shovel hands of Graeme Smith at first slip.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>32nd over: England 127-1 (chasing 197, Strauss 42, Bell 0)</strong><br>Bell walks a long, long way across his stumps to Ntini first ball. The ball flies to third man - but it's given as leg-byes, which means it must have been a pretty close shout, even allowing for Ntini's largely prohibitive angle. Hawkeye indeed has it hitting a good portion of leg stump.</p> <p>\"Have you got my Mick Hucknall poster?\" writes Sam Collins. \"I can't find it anywhere.\" No I haven't, Collins, you sick fool.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>33rd over: England 130-1 (chasing 197, Strauss 45, Bell 0)</strong><br>Strauss lifts Harris high over the infield, like a father hoisting his child above his head, for a couple. I wouldn't even take Harris as a Kolpak; he is useless.</p> <p>\"So, the question is, is Cook the 'new' Thorpe? Scoring plenty of <br>half tons, and not converting,\" says David Horn. \"And, if so, is that a bad thing? Discuss.\" Interesting. They could hardly have got those half-tons in different ways, but it was a huge problem for Thorpe (and another left-hander, Stephen Fleming), in the first half of his career. The thing is, of course, that before this year it wasn't a problem: I think only Bradman, Miandad and A.N.Other had scored more Test tons before their 23rd birthday.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>34th over: England 138-1 (chasing 197, Strauss 53, Bell 0)</strong> Strauss screws a back-foot force off Ntini to third man. With nobody there, it goes for four. Strauss then plays a really nice stroke through midwicket for a boundary that brings up his fifty, his first of the series, from 95 balls and with five fours. It's been a pulse-free effort, but it's probably breathed new life into his Test career.</p> <p>\"Have you got my Angela Lansbury keyring?\" writes Sam Collins (well, nobody <em>else</em> is writing in, are they eh?). \"I can't find it anywhere.\" No I haven't, Collins, you sick fool.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>35th over: England 138-1 (chasing 197, Strauss 53, Bell 0)</strong> <br>Harris continues over the wicket to Bell and - no word of a lie - he has a chance put down. Bell, going back, gets a big inside-edge onto the pad and McKenzie at short leg, moving to his right with all the speed of fossilisation (copyright Georgina Turner 2006), puts it down.</p> <p>\"Assuming we limp there soon, have you ever been more underwhelmed by a win?\" asks Lee Calvert. I was fairly underwhelmed when I 'won' a packet of Chewits simply for having my haircut at some dodgy alcoholic barbers (you never went after lunch, or if you did you paid the price) in Milton Regis once when I was kid, but that's about it.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>36th over: England 142-1 (chasing 197, Strauss 57, Bell 0)</strong><br>Good shot from Strauss, showing the full face to Ntini and putting him back down the ground for four. If England lose this, there's only one person to blame: Tom Daley. I've yet to be convinced he's not responsible for the sad drop in quality of Peep Show either. And as for the disappearance of Beef Discos.</p> <p>\"Have you got my Paul McKenna bottom-shaver?\" writes Sam Collins. \"I can't find it anywhere.\" No I haven't, Collins, you sick fool.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>37th over: England 146-1 (chasing 197, Strauss 57, Bell 4)</strong> Bell is a little uneasy against Harris as he gets used to the rough and the over-the-wicket angle, but it's just barely noticeable detail on the bigger picture of the match. Which is in itself barely noticeable etc on the bigger picture of the series.</p> <p>Eventually Bell works Harris nicely through midwicket for four to get off the mark.</p> <p>\"This consolation win is going book this whole shower on the plane to India, and then into the Ashes team,\" harrumphs Alfred Moore, who I might call Alfie from now on just for the sake of it. \"I've suspected for a while that Strauss is the consummate cricket politician - great at getting elected, but rubbish at governing - because he knows that a fifty in the last Test is worth about a hundred and fifty in the first.\"</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 147-2 (Bell b Ntini 4)</strong><br>Great idea/execution combos of our time: part one in a short series. Ian Bell, the Oval, 2008, decides to combat Makhaya Ntini's unusual angle by walking miles across his stumps to work him to leg. He should be given LBW first ball but isn't. He carries on regardless, fearless eejit that he is, and is bowled round his legs from <em>over</em> the wicket playing exactly the same shot. Dear oh dear; that was pitiful.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>38th over: England 147-2 (chasing 197, Strauss 57, Pietersen 0)</strong><br>The idea is not unsound - Pietersen does it excellently against Ntini to open up the leg side - but Bell misjudged the extent to which he needed to go across to a frankly hideous degree.</p> <p>\"Rob, it's time to put your cards on the table and give us your touring 15 for India,\" says Sam Blackledge. Not this again! I did the other day! (!!!!!!!!). Anyway, it would be: Cook, Vaughan, Bell, KP (we're friends; he calls me RS, at least I think that's what he says honkety honk!), Collingwood, Flintoff, Prior, Foster, Harmison, Sidebottom, Jones, Panesar, Swann, Broad, Bopara.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 147-3 (Strauss c Smith b Harris 58)</strong><br>Could an epic farce be unfolding? Probably not, but Strauss has gone. It was straightforward stuff: he pushed forward with hard hands at Harris, but got an inside-edge onto the pad and round the corner to Smith at leg slip.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>39th over: England 148-3 (chasing 197, Pietersen 0, Collingwood 1)</strong><br>I'm putting some salt on my toenails just in case, because if England lose another one it opens up a huge tail. Still, I'm sure there is no chance of them blowing this. Collingwood pads up to the rest of Harris's over.</p> <p>\"Do you have my matching Gareth Gates pyjamas and duvet cover set?\" says James McKerney. \"I can't find them anywhere.\" Actually I <em>do</em>. Do you need them back straight away? They're awful comfortable.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>40th over: England 152-3 (chasing 197, Pietersen 0, Collingwood 5)</strong><br>Collingwood works Ntini to leg for an all-run four, and then misses a pull that goes through to Boucher. Atherton thinks there was an inside-edge but replays show it just hit the right thigh. Outstanding umpiring from Steve Davis.</p> <p>If Collingwood is to stay in this team - and he deserves to in the short term after that century - it must be at No5. He and Pietersen bat really well together. It's odd that teams are happy to structure a batting order according to left-hand/right-hand balance but rarely in accordance with something more important: chemistry. Anyone think of other great pairs batting together? When they weren't running each other out farcically, Butcher and Hussain were superb together - there was Brisbane 98, Nottingham 03, Jamaica 04, Headingley 01, and other family favourites.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>41st over: England 156-3 (chasing 197, Pietersen 4, Collingwood 5)</strong><br>Pietersen uses that huge reach to whip Harris majestically, and against the spin, through midwicket for four, a shot of naked, mind-boggling talent.</p> <p>\"Many thanks for starting the Tom Daley backlash,\" says David Hopkins. \"No one likes a show-off, especially one who is less than half your age. Can I be the first to state that even if he is only fourteen, he still finished last which makes him a LOSER. Could you arrange for the Guardian to print a Tom Daley dartboard cf. the Sun's David Beckham one in 1998.\" I don't know about a dartboard, but I'm sure he could be included as a key ingredient in one of the free recipes.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>42nd over: England 161-3 (chasing 197, Pietersen 7, Collingwood 5)</strong><br>Morkel is back on, for Ntini, and it's a sign that South Africa aren't too bothered about this that they haven't brought on Kallis to bowl at his bunny. Either that or Kallis is carrying an injury. Pietersen, in the meantime, plays another sumptuous wristy stroke through midwicket, this time for three off Morkel. </p> <p>\"Wot no Shah?\" says Steve Busfield. \"Does this batting line up not need some refreshing?\" Well it does, but Collingwood has done enough to stay in for a bit now. With the exception of Pietersen and to an extent Cook, everyone's places are up for grabs in the short-to-medium term. But I think Bell, Vaughan and Collingwood have done enough to deserve a chance in India. Key is next cab on the rank for Bell, Denly for Vaughan, and Bopara for Collingwood. In my opinion too much water has gone under the bridge - like with Andy Cole and England - for Shah to be able to play with freedom in the Test team. They are only so many times you can be rejected before you conclude that it's not them, it's you. Not playing him in Sri Lanka last year was a disgusting decision on, at a conservative estimate, 46 levels.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>43rd over: England 161-3 (chasing 197, Pietersen 7, Collingwood 5)</strong><br>This could turn out very, very well for KP: a win in the first Test as captain, the man of the match award I would have thought, and maybe the winning runs as well. Anyway, Harris continues into the rough, and I suspect it won't be too long before we see the first switch-hit from a Test captain. He actually dummied to do it from one ball in that over. </p> <p>\"Hussain and Butcher were good, but Hoggy and Gilo were superb!\" says Gary Naylor, eschewing insight in favour of unashamedly brainless nostalgia. And who can blame him, frankly.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>44th over: England 170-3 (chasing 197, Pietersen 7, Collingwood 14)</strong><br>Consecutive boundaries for Collingwood off Morkel: the first was pulled witheringly, the second time through midwicket. </p> <p>\"For a brief while Flintoff and Geraint Jones proved a fine partnership,\" says Paul Roberts (and a few others). \"Maybe to recover Freddie's batting form, England need to recall Papua New Guinea's finest.\"</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>45th over: England 170-3 (chasing 197, Pietersen 7, Collingwood 15)</strong> For those of you calling me various shades of eff, the reason I'd leave Anderson out is that, for all his admirable improvement, I just don't think he is good enough to take wickets against the very best. Do what the opposition least want you to do. Ricky Ponting would pick Anderson to bowl at him all day.</p> <p>\"Have you got my signed photo of Tom Daley?\" says Wesley Ball. \"If you have, you can keep it.\"</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>46th over: England 175-3 (chasing 197, Pietersen 8, Collingwood 19)</strong> Nearly there now, as Collingwood dumps Morkel contemptuously over midwicket for four more. There is a perception about Collingwood that he doesn't have shots, but it's more about the mindset he sometimes gets into when he's wearing whites. Batting with KP frees him up, I think.</p> <p>\"What's Vaughan done with the bat of late?\" challenges Dominic O'Reilly. Sweet eff, but I think he's earned enough slack for us to accept his explanation - that the captaincy was frazzling his mind - and to give him at least those two Tests to see if he was right or if he was telling big fat porkies. A year ago, in Sri Lanka, he played superbly as an opener - and with the dustbowls we'll probably get it's even more importantly we have an opener who embraces calculated risk against the new ball.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>47th over: England 175-3 (chasing 197, Pietersen 8, Collingwood 19)</strong><br>Harris and KP continue their little leg-stump stand-off: it's Adelaide 2006 all over again! (The good bit, on the second day, not the unmentionable.) A maiden.</p> <p>\"Hear hear re: that irritatingly little snot-nosed brat at the Olympics,\" says Richard Norris. \"I know he's only 14, but what does he want: a medal?\"</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>48th over: England 178-3 (chasing 197, Pietersen 9, Collingwood 19)</strong><br>Pietersen takes one of his buttock-clenchingly tight singles into the off side. The throw missed by a while; had it hit it would have been, well, buttock-clenchingly tight.</p> <p>\"I remember Robin Smith and Allan Lamb being great together in the late 80s/very early 90s,\" says Oliver Lewis. \"Yes, they were both Saffers, but I think crucially both had moustaches. More than a coincidence I think.\" Especially against the West Indies, when they went way beyond the call of duty for their adopted country.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 182-4 (Pietersen c McKenzie b Harris 13)</strong> <br>Pietersen falls in tame fashion. Harris switched to around the wicket with mid-off and mid-on back in an attempt to play on the ego, and Pietersen just plopped one onto his pad and up in the air for short leg to take the catch.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>49th over: England 182-4 (chasing 197; Collingwood 19, Flintoff 0)</strong><br>Kim Sibthorpe's life may be missing something: life, chiefly. \"Whatever happened to the slower ball?? I was thinking about this the other day.\"</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>50th over: England 185-4 (chasing 197; Collingwood 22, Flintoff 1)</strong><br>Nel comes on for one last spurt, but somebody forgot to grease him up: he's rumbling in at about quarter rat-power.</p> <p>\"Couldn't agree more about Anderson,\" says Alfie Moore. \"This is supposed to have been his breakthrough season, but 15 wickets @ 34 doesn't seem much of a breakthrough. Compare Hoggard's breakthrough series in South Africa 04-05: 26 wickets @ 25. If we stick with Anderson we'll just be cultivating mediocrity - we'd be better off bringing back Hoggard, who has the nous to be our Chaminda Vaas.\" What he said.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>51st over: England 186-4 (chasing 197; Collingwood 23, Flintoff 1)</strong><br>Mid-off and mid-on go back for Flintoff against Harris as well, though not quite as far as for Pietersen, but Flintoff isn't yet confident enough in this environment to finish a game as he would at county level, or as he would at Test level a few years back, so he blocks assiduously.</p> <p>\"Just about any combination of very tall and very short batsmen works well, as it upsets the bowler's length,\" says John Starbuck, inadvertently pointing out that Will Jefferson is the key to Tim Ambrose's Test career. \"Think Greig and Knott, if your memory goes that far back.\" My memory doesn't go back to the start of thi- what day is this?</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>52nd over: England 188-4 (chasing 197; Collingwood 25, Flintoff 1)</strong><br>Collingwood tucks Nel off his pads and, in a gesture that sums up the man, Ntini charges across the boundary, dives and saves two runs: an outstanding piece of work. What a thoroughly admirable fellow he is.</p> <p>\"Is Tom Daley the greatest British loser since Eddie 'The Eagle' Edwards,\" says Lee Calvert, \"Sure, Daley has the excuse of being 14, but Edwards equally had the excuse of being nearly blind. Also, Daley has had access to pools full of water for all of his recently over-exposed life while Eddie had to practice on slides in his local park, skateboard half-pipes and his own stairs. And while I'm on, have you got my Diagnosis Murder tankard?\" Gave it to Sam Collins. You'll do well to get that back.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>ENGLAND WIN AN ENTIRELY MEANINGLESS GAME BY SIX WICKETS!!! </strong> <br>Flintoff rocks back to cut Harris for four and then, when Harris tempts him with some flight, Flintoff can't resist ending the match in the grand manner with the most marvellous straight six. He finishes on 11 and Paul Collingwood on 25.</p> <p>So there we are. It's a happy ending to a pretty downbeat summer, but at least England can go forward into the winter with optimism, however misplaced it might seem to be. They were always going to win this game after rolling South Africa on the first day, and they finished the job pretty efficiently today. Certainly, they look a better side with five bowlers. Thanks for all your emails, and please do rejoin us for the one-day series in 11 days' time. Please.</p>",
  "<p><strong>2pm Beijing time</strong> Welcome to the Water Cube, where Tom Daley is about to take his Olympic bow alongside Blake Aldridge in the synchronised 10m platform diving, due off at 2.30pm here.</p> <p>The British contingent inside the aquatics centre is beaming after Rebecca Adlington and Joanne Jackson took gold and bronze in the 400m freestyle a couple of hours ago, but young Tom's debut is not a parochial affair. He made the front page of the China Daily's sports section today, evidence that he has captured the imagination beyond Blighty.</p> <p>They love a diver in China, unsurprising perhaps given that they have won 20 of the 32 titles in Olympic history, and they look nailed on for another one this afternoon courtesy of reigning world champions Lin Yue and Huo Lang. Russian pair Gleb Galperin and Dmitriy Dobroskok look the most likely challengers to the Chinese so the received wisdom is that Tom and Blake - does that make them sound like singer and lead guitar in an earnest indie band? - are competing for the bronze with the USA and Germany. T&amp;B appeared at poolside about 40 minutes ago to join the throng of divers warming up for competition. There are about 20 divers hurling themselves off the various springboards and platforms in front of me, almost casually reeling off fiendishly acrobatic dives.</p> <p>T&amp;B joined in at 1.37pm, taking their first practice plunge off the 5m platform, before trying the 10m board 10 minutes later. Helpfully Tom is wearing black wristbands, which makes identification a little easier. Surprisingly given his youth and size - he's 5'1\" in his verucca socks - he's not that much smaller or younger-looking than the rest of the field.</p> <p>They have just wandered over to speak to Leon Taylor, who won silver with Pete Waterfield four years ago and has been acting as his mentor in the run-up to the games. The British entourage all give the pair a hug and they are off to the locker room to prepare for the real thing.</p> <p><strong>2.15pm</strong> A word about the format. There are eight teams in today's final qualifying by virtue of performances in the 2007 World Championships and the 2008 World Cup. They are, by order of start list, Australia, Cuba, Great Britain, Germany, USA, Colombia, China and Russia.</p> <p>Each pair will perform six dives in rotation, each of which has a degree of difficulty. Daley and Aldridge will start with a forward one-and-a-half somersault. With pike. Obviously. Degree-of-difficulty 2.0. There are nine judges, four to rate execution and five to look after synchronisation. As the name suggests, that last category is the key to the event. The official list does not give the nationality of the judges, so the conspiracy theories will have to wait until later.</p> <p>Two execution judges sit on each side of the pool judging the diver nearest to them only. The five synchronicity judges also split up but watch both divers. They then each award a mark out of 10, with the highest and lowest score in each category dropped. That leaves five scores of 10 or less. The total is then multiplied by three and divided by five to give a raw score out of 30. That is then multiplied by the degree of difficulty to give the final score. Got that?</p> <p><strong>2.20pm</strong> The teams have just arrived and lined up in their tracksuits for their introduction. A large cheer and several Union flags greet T&amp;B, but the welcome is beaten by the reception the Australians get. Lots of Aussies lingering from the morning events I suspect. The Chinese get a huge roar. Young Tom looks his usual unnaturally relaxed self.</p> <p><strong>2.30pm</strong> Leon Taylor is not only an Olympic silver medallist but also officially a very nice chap. He has just shared the benefit of his considerable wisdom with the Guardian moments before going on air to share it with the nation. According to Leon, Tom is relaxed, but the challenge he and Blake face is performing under pressure in their first major final.</p> <p>\"When Pete and I got our medal in Athens we had the benefit of having been to Sydney and finished fifth,\" he says. \"We left there knowing what an Olympic final is about and in Athens we knew if we did our stuff some of the rookies would drop away. If Tom and Blake can deal with the pressure then they have a chance.\"</p> <p><strong>2.30pm</strong> Tom's parents Rob and Debbie have been spotted in the crowd on the far side of the pool with his two brothers and all four grandparents. Tom has just been spotted in the shower and he can't resist a grin at the camera. He really does appear to be made for this. Meanwhile, the Australians Matthew Helm and Robert Newberry are on the board for the first dive. It's all downhill from here...</p> <p><strong>2.32pm</strong> Aged 14 years and 94 days Tom Daley is about to appear in an Olympic final.</p> <p><strong>2.34</strong> And it's a good one by the look of it. They score 52.8 overall, with higher marks for synchronisation than execution. No sign of nerves from here, but they will be feeling better for that.</p> <p><strong>2.40pm</strong> The first round is over with Daley and Aldridge lying joint third in a three-way tie with Australia and Germany. All the teams kicked off with fairly routine dives, nothing more difficult than a 2.0, but it is fairly clear already that the Chinese are the team to beat.</p> <p>Lin Yue and Huo Lang loook less like two divers than one and a mirror. Their first effort was the most straightforward there is, listed simply as a \"forward dive\" with pike, but they nailed it and barely left a splash behind them and got a whopping 57.0 from the judges. True to the form book the Russians are lying second with 53.4, then comes the pack on 52.8. Long way to go and all that, but T&amp;B seem to be scrapping for the places.</p> <p><strong>2.51pm</strong> Relax everyone, the politicians have arrived. Sports minister Gerry Sutcliffe has just slipped into his seat two along from Tessa Jowell just in time to see T&amp;B take their second plunge, an inward one-and-half somersault that the judges don't like so much. They get only 50.4 for an effort that somehow, imperceptibly almost was not as tidy as their first. It is hard to say how, but you get a sense of whether they've nailed it from the sound as the pair of them enter the water like missiles. The better executed the dive the less splash, and the more synchronised they are the crisper the noise as they enter the water. That noise was, for want of the technical term, a bit sloppy.</p> <p>It wasn't good enough to keep them in the medal places after two rounds either. The Americans, Germans and the Aussies out-scored them there, but all are chasing the Chinese. Lin and Huo's second dive was, according to the judges, approaching perfection, an inward dive - they start with their backs to the water - worth 59.4, only six tenths off a perfect 60 for that dive. They've opened up an 8 point lead on the Russians and there's a 13-point gap to T&amp;B. Work to do.</p> <p><strong>3.03pm</strong> Round three and another splashy effort from T&amp;B. Their most difficult dive yet, an inward three-and-a-half somersault gets nothing better than a seven for execution, but the synchronicity wasn't too bad. Was that a touch of over-rotation I spotted on entry? I'll check with a judge later.</p> <p>Anyway, it's dropped them down to last place because the opposition are starting to get tricksy. Even the Cubans and the Colombians have steamed past. The German pair Patrick Hausding and Sascha Klein just pulled off a very fancy effort, two-and-half backward somersaults with one-and-a-half twists thrown in. Most of us would be lucky to live if we tried it, but they manage to break the water within a fag paper of each other to push up into the medals at the expense of the USA. The Chinese continue to set the standard and are way out in front. On this form they could afford to bomb their last dive and still win.</p> <p><strong>3.13pm</strong> THe halfway stage and it seems that Blake is in charge of the team, assuming that the boss is the one that says \"Ready, steady, go\" when they're balancing on tiptoe 10m above the pool. Not sure exactly what he says, but he definitely mouths something that only Tom can hear before the leap into the void.</p> <p>A better effort by some distance in the fourth round, a back three-and-a-half somersault, and a poor effort from the Germans cheers up the Brits a bit more. They are resigned however to young Tom marking this one down as experience.</p> <p>The Chinese meanwhile are already humming the national anthem as Lin Yue and Huo Lang produce another awesome effort. As they leap into their inward three-and-a-half somersault even the water droplets spraying from their hair appear to fly in unison. They maintain their eight point lead over the Russians, and the tussle for bronze looks to be between the USA, currently third, and the Germans four points back. T&amp;B lie seventh, ahead of the Cubans.</p> <p><strong>3.20pm</strong> Fascinating though it is to concentrate on a lad who ought be on his BMX with his mates experimenting with tobacco, but instead finds himself taking on the world, it would be remiss not to briefly mention the rest of the field. The Cubans are the duo you would least want to fight, while the Colombians have the best tattoos by some distance. The Russians have the palest skin and sternest brows, just ahead of the Germans.</p> <p>While we wait for the fifth round to get under way, meanwhile, a hidden DJ plays us a re-mix of what I think is Cotton Eye Joe, a risible dance track from the late 1990s. Those keen to know who it was by, look below later. Someone will know.</p> <p><strong>3.27pm</strong> We've seen the fifth round and the Chinese could still win if only one diver makes it up the ladder. They are 24 points clear and the crowd are going wild, flags waving as they chant \"China, China\". Another iffy disco tune is playing and everyone else joins in for a bit of a boogie in the stands. It feels like a lively rain delay at Wimbledon with revolutionary Communist overtones.</p> <p>Behind the Chinese the Russians look safe in second, but the battle for bronze is wide open, though not open enough for T&amp;B to have a chance. They are still seventh, holding off the Cubans for pride's sake, but anyone of Germany, currently third, Australia and the USA can take the third medal.</p> <p><strong>3.35pm</strong> That's it, all over in the Water Cube and Tom Daley's first Olympic competition ends in last place, less than a point behind the Cubans. Leon Taylor was right - performing under this pressure when you have never encountered it before is not easy. Tom looks as delighted to be here as he has since that grin first emerged, and he knows that he will have a much better chance to take a medal four years hence, all being well. Blake may not get the chance, which is why he looks a little more glum.</p> <p>China, naturally, have taken gold, and they almost took the roof off with their final dive, a hugely difficult back two-and-a-half somersault with two-and-a-half twists. I feel like I need to visit my chiropractor after typing it, but they manage it effortlessly to seal China's 22nd diving gold in Olympic history.</p> <p>In a dramatic finish meanwhile the Germans edge out the Russians for the silver, much to the disappointment of Gleb and Dmitriy. Off to see what T&amp;B have to say about it now, thanks for paying attention.</p>",
  "<p>Spanish cyclist Maria Isabel Moreno has become the first competitor at the Beijing Olympics to fail a drugs test.<br> Moreno, better known as Maribel Moreno, had been entered for the women's road race and individual time trial and tested positive for the endurance-boosting EPO drug. </p> <p>IOC spokesperson Giselle Davies said Moreno was tested on July 31 and left the city on the same evening. The IOC officially took control of drugs testing on July 27. </p> <p>Davies said Moreno, 27, had been stripped of her Games accreditation and the matter had been referred to the International Cycling Union (UCI). The UCI confirmed the doping offence.<br> The IOC has said it expected between 30 and 40 positive drugs tests during the Olympics and has boosted the number of Games-related drugs tests to more than 4,500. </p> <p>The Spanish Olympic Committee said it was unaware of the positive test until being informed today. \"We got this news for breakfast,\" Jose Maria Bellon, SOC Director of Communications, said.<br> \"She arrived in the first group of Spanish athletes on July 31. It seems the same day she arrived, she had a drugs test and after that had a panic attack and asked the [cycling] Federation to be allowed to return to Madrid.\" </p> <p>This is not the first time that athletes have been tested upon their entry into the village. </p> <p>Greek sprinters Costas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou missed a drugs test at the Athens 2004 Games only a few hours after checking in at the Olympic village and were subsequently banned. </p> <p>The discovery of a positive test for EPO is also good news for the IOC, given the questions surrounding the testers' ability to trace the substance. The IOC had insisted it would have a test in Beijing that would trace a new version of the EPO substance. </p> <p>Moreno could now face a two-year ban and under a new IOC rule could also miss the 2012 London Olympics. </p> <p>A statement on the cyclist's website said Moreno was in Spain recovering from \"a strong anxiety attack suffered in the athletes' village\". </p> <p>\"Even though her state of health is good she does not feel ready to justify or explain her reasons for leaving the village,\" the statement said. It said she was planning to hold a press conference in the Spanish city of Zaragoza today.</p> <p>Cycling has been among the hardest hit by the spread of doping in professional sports in recent years, with Spanish cyclists embroiled in some of the biggest drugs cases. </p> <p>Two Spanish riders tested positive for EPO during this year's Tour de France last month. Following a string of positive tests, Spain launched Operation Puerto in 2006 after raids in Madrid and Zaragoza uncovered large quantities of anabolic steroids, laboratory equipment used for blood transfusions and more than 200 bags of code-named blood, some of which were linked to leading cyclists. </p> <p>The UCI has also repeatedly accused Spain of doing little to tackle the problem. </p> <p>EPO, which boosts the body's capacity to use oxygen, is mainly used by endurance athletes such as distance runners and cyclists, but also by sprinters who want explosive starts in their events and want to quickly increase oxygen capacity.</p>",

  "<p>UK television executives have criticised a leaked memo from an executive at US network ABC that appeared to call on its in-house producers to rip off foreign format ideas.</p> <p>ABC declined to comment on the memo, although those who have seen it believe it to be authentic.</p> <p>UK producers' trade body Pact confirmed to MediaGuardian.co.uk it had also been made aware of the memo by one of its members and was \"looking into it\".</p> <p>The document, dated June 24, was signed by Howard Davine, the executive vice-president of ABC Studios, the production arm of the US network, and first surfaced on US media blog <a href=\"http://www.deadlinehollywooddaily.com/bombshell-abc-studios-memo-a-blueprint-to-rip-off-foreign-tv-series/\">Deadline Hollywood Daily</a> before being circulated around UK independent producers.</p> <p>American journalist Nikki Finke, who published it on her blog, described it as a \"shocking official ABC Studios memo\" that was a \"bombshell\" and a \"blatant blueprint to rip off foreign TV series\".</p> <p>Addressed to ABC showrunners and executive producers, Davine wrote: \"As I'm sure you're all aware, foreign formats have increased in popularity as the basis for US television development and production. </p> <p>\"What is often overlooked, or not fully appreciated, are the complexities associated with negotiating format deals, coupled with the fact that often-times what is appealing in the format may be nothing more than a general underlying premise, which, in and of itself, may be no reason to license the underlying property.\"</p> <p>Davine warned the memo's recipients that they should consider a number of issues before \"entering into a transaction on an underlying format\" with foreign producers.</p> <p>These included being aware that the format rights holders would want an executive producer credit and a \"degree of creative control/involvement typically to be rendered from a foreign location, adding perhaps an unnecessary layer to the creative process\".</p> <p>\"Let me assure you that we continue to be actively, competitively and aggressively engaged in developing product based on foreign formats and our decision whether or not to get into negotiations will be premised purely on creative need and our legal analysis as to whether underlying rights are required,\" he said.</p> <p>An ABC Studios spokeswoman declined to comment on the memo when contacted by MediaGuardian.co.uk.</p> <p>One executive at a UK independent producer said he could not believe Davine had put the thoughts down in writing, saying it reflected badly on ABC.</p> <p>Another UK independent producer disputed Davine's contention that often what was appealing about TV formats was \"nothing more than a general underlying premise\".</p> <p>\"The point about a format is the twist or the way an idea is executed. That is what makes it so valuable. The premise is often not enough,\" this source said. </p> <p>\"Formats cost money for a reason. They are valuable because they have some unique properties. It is a false economy to try and do something in the same area but without making the show you really want.</p> <p>\"American broadcasters have been pretty good at importing formats from around the world and respecting these formats. ABC have been the leaders in this.\"</p> <p>Another UK TV executive said the memo appeared to signal a shift in the \"modus operandi\" between producers and broadcasters.</p> <p>\"Generally speaking, the balance is regarded as fair, but when something like this comes along it makes people think the broadcaster wants a shift,\" the source said.</p> <p>Pact chief operating officer and director of business affairs, Andrew Chowns, added: \"We have been made aware of the memo and we are looking at it.\"</p> <p>UK producers, such as BBC Worldwide and RDF Media, do huge amounts of business with ABC, with shows such as Supernanny, Wife Swap and Dancing with the Stars all airing on the network.</p> <p>In her blog, Finke described the memo as \"shocking\". \"Those who've seen it are shaking their heads in disbelief,\" she wrote on her Deadline Hollywood blog.</p> <p>She said the memo \"blesses anyone who brings foreign formats to ABC Studios first so that the studio can steal the idea without paying the fat licensing fees that would accompany an up and up deal\".</p> <p>Finke added that ABC Studios did not want to \"repeat what happened with a show like Ugly Betty\", which was based on a Latin American telenovella.</p> <p><em><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857.

  "<p>Great Britain's men opened their Olympics with a 4-2 victory over Pakistan, the team one place above them in the world rankings. It was a comfortable win, with James Tindall giving his side the lead in the second minute of the match. </p> <p>By half-time they were 3-0 up, and though Pakistan did score twice in the second half, Matt Daly scored a crucial fourth goal to end any anxiety that Britain's lead might be overhauled.</p> <p>In the last six games between the teams, Pakistan have twice scored eight goals, and their front pairing of Rehan Butt and Shakeel Abbasi is one of the quickest, most effective in the tournament.</p> <p>So the most satisfying aspect of Britain's performance was their solidity at the back. Alistair McGregor had a superb match in goal, producing two fine diving saves to deny Abbasi. He had to be in good form, because Britain were generous with their fouls, conceding five short corners in the first half alone. </p> <p>None were converted though. The dazzling dribbling skills of Abbasi and Butt were invariably squandered by wayward final passes or shot, but Britain were still lucky when an early effort from a short corner struck the left post.</p> <p>At the other end of the pitch, Pakistan were significantly less troublesome, their defense in a muddle throughout. Their vulnerability was exposed early on when James Tindall ran on to a through ball in the first minute, cut right past the last defender and drove the ball into the top left of the net.</p> <p>Rob Moore added a second in the 14th minute, turning and shooting low past the 'keeper after being set up by his captain, Ben Hawes, who was involved again when Ashley Jackson added a third from a short corner in the 29th minute.</p> <p>While Abbasi and Muhammad Waqas did bring Pakistan back into the match as Britain's concentration waned, Daly's goal was the perfect riposte. He pounced on a loose ball after the Pakistani keeper, Salman Akbar, had made a good save, and flicked it into the goal.</p> <p>A good start then, but with only the top two teams from each group of six going through they face tougher challenges ahead, beginning with a match against reigning Olympic champions, the Netherlands, on Wednesday.</p> <p>Head coach Jason Lee was understandably delighted with the result, especially the way his team opened the match - although he almost missed the first goal. </p> <p>\"It was a brilliant start. I had hardly settled into my seat in my coaching box [in the stand] when we scored and I got told off for shouting too much,\" said the former GB international. </p> <p>\"We scored early in the Olympic qualifying tournament final against India [in Chile in April] and today felt a bit like that. It certainly helped ease the nerves because we were nervous, to say the least.\"</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>And on the third day of the Olympics</strong>, your minute-by-minute correspondent has for you - 14 year-old Tom Daley makes the youngest Olympic debut by a Brit since <a href=\"http://www.oxfordmail.net/news/headlines/display.var.2078538.0.youngest_olympian_reclaims_title.php\">Ken Burns</a>, Michael Phelps in the pool, the Murray brothers, Great Britain versus Pakistan in the hockey, Britain's Andrew Smith in the badminton, Rebecca Adlington and Jo Jackson going for gold in the freestyle, not to mention archery, basketball, sailing, shooting and fencing.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>02:05am: </strong>Straight off to Hong Kong where Daisy Dick has just recorded a clear round on Spring Along in the cross country stage of the <strong>team eventing</strong>, getting round in 8:42.89. As you can read <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/10/olympics2008.olympicsequestrian\">here,</a> Britain are currently lying fourth in the team event. Let me also quickly point you to our handy day's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympics/2008/events/aug/09\">schedule</a> (in Chinese time) and encourage you to sign up for our free daily email, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/series/thebeijinger\">The Beijinger</a>.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>02: 15am:</strong> Next up is William Fox-Pitt, who it's fair to say completely blitzed the course. He went round in 8:24.39 - which moved him up from 34th to fifth. Temper your excitement, however. Only three of the team's scores count. That is the last three. IE. Not Daisy Dick or William Fox Pitt unless everyone else messes it up.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>02:21am: </strong>Re-live your <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2006/mar/05/features.sport10\">Sean Kerly memories</a>. Today's first <strong>hockey</strong> match, between China and Germany is currently locked at 1-1. At 0330 it's the wrongly fallen from public favour Great Britain against Pakistan, who have plenty of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/jul/29/olympicshockey.olympicgames2008?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=sport\">problems of their own</a>.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>02:29am: </strong>Watching the Turko/Greek news earlier, I was struck by how heavily they're going on both the basketball and <strong>beach volleyball</strong>. After losing the first set, Latvia are pushing hard to level it up with Argentina in today's men's beach volley.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>02:39am:</strong> So yesterday saw Nicole Cook take the first British gold of the Games, made extra special nice because no-one on the outside (apart from <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/10/canny_rehearsals_of_team_cooke.html\">William Fotheringham</a>) really expected it. Today the big hopes rest with Rebecca Adlington and Jo Jackson in the 400m freestyle at 0415ish. And a bit later in the morning with the British archery team of Larry Godfrey, Alan Wills and Simon Terry. Of course, a bit like this year's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/mar/14/popandrock.shopping\">Elbow album</a>, what you love about the Olympics is the heroes what come from nowhere. Perhaps the next one will be Scot Jon Hammond currently trying to qualify for the men's 10m air rifle.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>02: 48am:</strong> Their world championship-winning men's team beat Greece in impressive fashion yesterday, today it's the Spanish women's <strong>basketball </strong>team's turn. They're already 18-7 up against New Zealand. We'll draw a veil over the fact the Spanish men's team posed for a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/11/olympicsbasketball.olympics20081\">photo </a>making slit-eyed gestures.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>02:50am:</strong> I've cursed him. Briton Jon Hammond lies 40th midway through his 10m air rifle qualification. He really would be an unexpected medal hero now.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>02:59am: </strong><strong>Swimming</strong>. It might be the 100m relay, but one man is going to dominate the coverage - that man <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/11/olympicsaquatics.olympics2008\">Michael Phelps</a>. What no-one predicted, however, was Britain to qualify. They just finished fourth in their semi-final - setting a new British record of 3:13:69 by 5 seconds in the process. The French won in near world record time.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>03:02: am </strong>Hockey. Germany have beaten China 4-1 in the hockey. In the women's <strong>basketball</strong>, Spain are now leading New Zealand 40-27.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>3.05 am:</strong> <strong>Badminton. </strong>Want to see the Milton Keynes house of British badminton hopeful Andrew Smith? Well now you can, courtesy of this <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAaLa2QhlLw\">unenthusiastic Team GB diary</a>. The words contractually and obliged spring to mind. Anyway, Smith is about to start a tough match with Marc Zwiebler. At least the German can't do backhand smashes like <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahd5smCyaaw\">this</a>.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>3.10 am:</strong> <strong>Team Eventing. </strong>The first 'proper' British rider, Tina Cook, has had a good round scoring 57.4. She lies sixth place overall, Fox-Pitt is now ninth. A bit surreally, the cross-country course crosses over a golf course, which sounds like a good excuse to remind you that earlier this morning Padraig Harrington won the US PGA at Oakland Hills. After winning the same amount of majors as Ernie Els, Vijay Singh and Phil Mickelson - <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/11/is_padraig_harrington_now_the.html\">is Padraig Harrington now the best of the rest?</a></p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>3.15 am:</strong> <strong>Swimming. </strong><a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/10/phelps_might_truly_be_touched.html\">Andy Bull doesn't reckon he's all that</a>, but Michael Phelps bid to win eight golds just keeps on trucking. The American just qualified for the final in the 200m freestyle, albeit in a tired third. Talking about living legends, congratulations to Australian, Stephanie Rice, who won the women's 400 meter individual medley on Sunday will be on her very own stamp from tomorrow.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>3.25 am:</strong> <strong>Swimming.</strong> Time for some <strong>Britwatch</strong>. Gemma Spofforth qualified for the 100m backstroke final as the fifth fastest qualifier with a time of 59.79. Tom Daley? You might have heard of him. Paul Kelso will be blogging live poolside on the Devon boy's exploits from 7am <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/11/tom_daleys_olympic_debut_live.html \">here</a>.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>3.35 am:</strong> <strong>Badminton. </strong>Andrew Smith has won his first game 21-16 against Marc Zwiebler. <strong>Tennis. </strong>Rafael Nadal is just warming-up ahead of opening his Olympic campaign against Italian Potito Starace. Like yesterday, however, it seems that the play will be interrupted by rain. That'd never happen at Wimbledon, you know.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>3.35 am:</strong> <strong>Swimming.</strong> <strong>Gold medal. </strong>Australian world champion Libby Trickett wins the 100m fly in some style. American Christine Magnuson was second and Trickett's teammate Jessicah Schipper third. Britain's Jemma Lowe finishes sixth in her first Olympic final.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>3.40 am:</strong> <strong>Hockey.</strong> With 22 minutes of the first half to go, GB are 1-0 up against Pakistan.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>3.45 am:</strong> The <strong>swimming</strong> pool is the place to go for world records. Japan's Kosuke Kitajima smashes the 59 second barrier to take gold in the 100m breaststroke. Alexander Dale Oen of Norway takes silver while France's Hugues Duboscq claims bronze.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>4.00 am:</strong> <strong>A Britwatch special</strong>. Not with Nick Ross. Though after winning the first game, Andrew Smith has criminally thrown it away in the <strong>badminton</strong>. The German Marc Zwiebler recovered to win the final two games. The British <strong>archery</strong> team are 81-78 down against China. In the <strong>shooting </strong>Jon Hammond finished 29th in the 10m air rifle semi-final, not good enough to make the final. In a <a href=\"http://www.billybragg.co.uk/index.php\">Bill Bragg </a>patriotic way, good job that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/10/olympicsaquatics.olympics2008\">Rebecca Adlington </a>and Jo Jackson are due in the pool.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>4.15 am:</strong> In <strong>basketball</strong>, Isobel Sanchez drove Spain's women to rout New Zealand 82-65. In <strong>handball</strong>, it says here, France have beaten Kazakhstan 21-18. Rebecca Adlington and Jo Jackson are being introduced to the crowd. We're just moments away from the 400m freestyle event...</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>4.20 am:</strong> <strong>Swimming. Gold and Bronze for team GB! </strong>The Pixar film <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/jul/18/animation\">Wall-E</a> was a massive disappointment for me. Really boring and morally if not politically dubious like Lang's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis_(film)\">Metropolis</a>. But that, my friends was the opposite x100. An absolutely corking race! Gold for GB with Rebecca Adlington! Bronze for Jo Jackson! Ladies and gentleman, is why we love the Olympics. Katie Hoff of the States was second. 48 years of women's swimming hurt erased at 4 something in the morning.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>Email chat not from Gary Naylor. </strong> \"Don't know if you noticed,\" asks Conor O'Kane. \"But Adrian Moorhouse just said Bas(snip! theguardian.com Ed) on the Beeb. Butterfly is a relatively new event, came from breaststroke around fifty years ago, It's the Bas(snip! theguardian.com Ed) child of Breast stroke\". Frankly, after that race, we're all swearing now. Brilliant. Brilliant. Brilliant. That was freaking brilliant.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>4.30 am:</strong> <strong>Swimming. </strong>The great racing keeps coming. Michael Phelps eight gold medal haul is still on - he's just secured his second gold. The United States just pipped the 4x100m freestyle relay from France in the most dramatic possible circumstances. We're talking inches. Moot point whether French blew that on the final leg, or the States snatched it.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>Hockey. </strong>Christian Wolff is frustrated because Indian state TV is not showing the swimming. What are they showing Christian? \"We are being treated to the GB-Pak hockey match - presumably because Indians love seeing Pakistan lose...\" Oh, yes, Team GB are 3-1 up against Pakistan. With 15 mins to go.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>4.45 am:</strong> <strong>Swimming. </strong>We're still having a collective intake of breath over two exceptional races. On the telly Sharon Davies is still crying about Rebecca Adlington's gold and Jo Jackson's bronze. Meanwhile, Chris Wright is blown away by that 4x100 Freestyle relay, \"That 4x100 was amazing. The first five all beat the world record and even Britain, in last, were just half a second outside it.\" And in Christian Wolff in India, 'state TV's toying with its viewers has reached new heights: about 10 minutes ago, the hockey match was interrupted - said the studio anchor, \"and we're interrupting the hockey for good reason..\" - presumably to show the 4x100m relay final, RIGHT?! - \"in order to show you yesterday's highlights!\" Really.' Team GB are 4-2 up against Pakistan in the hockey as the game enters its dying moments.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>4.55 am:</strong> <strong>Equestrian.</strong> In fairness to Indian tv, all the non-Brits I know, are really frustrated with British Olympic coverage. Where is all the water polo? And the beach volleyball? They ask. Especially, our national obsession with 'horse racing, that isn't even horse racing.\" And what of our Eventing team? Well, William Fox-Pitt rode fastest for Great Britain who have risen to third after the cross country. The German team lead the rankings after impressive performances from their riders, while Australia dropped to second.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>5.00 am:</strong> <strong>Archery</strong> \"As the only Englishman in an all Chinese office here in Beijing,\" writes Steve George, \"the atmosphere is proving unusually tense, is anyone else watching the team GB/China archery showdown? Epic stuff, who'd have thought it...?\" Indeed, the giant darts competition was a bit of Lakeside thriller... But China edged out Team GB 214-210 in the end. Better for office diplomacy, I'm guessing.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>5.05 am:</strong> <strong>Cycling.</strong> From the sublime to the ridiculous. Spanish track cyclist Maria Isabel Moreno has been named as the first competitor in Beijing to fail a drugs test. Moreno, 27, would have been a rival of Britain's gold medallist Nicole Cook, tested positive for the blood-doping agent EPO.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>5.10 am:</strong> It's time for a Brit-in-the-antipodes-perspective from Andrew Jolly. \"At least for Brits at home it's all on in the middle of the night, and you don't have to face Olympic Mad Aussies popping into your office every 10 seconds to say that some Australian swimmer or other has smashed out a world record in the pool. I watched us win that race a moment ago, but am withholding any sort of interoffice gloat fest at the moment, I have learned from the Ashes that one wicket does not make a test match. Not even one. Or even a draw... Bring on the velodrome.\"</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>5.25 am:</strong> <strong>Shooting. </strong>Joy for Christian Wolff. Indian tv can stop showing Pakistan losing, India have won gold. Abhinav Bindra wins the men's 10m air rifle.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>Brit-in-the-antipodes-perspective II.</strong> \"TVNZ have helpfully got three live streaming channels online in addition to their TV coverage (also streamed online). Hurrah, thought I, I'll be able to watch the swimming. Except work's gone and blocked the stream\", tuts Joanna Harris in New Zealand, \"Of course there's no saying TVNZ would have shown the swimming; so far their coverage has been pretty appalling, for example hours of beach volleyball and boxing instead of rowing (we got the Kiwis' races, but that was it). And there are ad breaks every ten minutes.\"</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>5.30 am:</strong> <strong>Tennis.</strong>World No.1 elect Rafael Nadal is making uncharacteristically hard work of Italian World No.71 Potito Starace. After losing the first set, Strarace has pulled the second set back. It's going with serve in the third set.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>5.45 am:</strong> <strong>Fencing. Britwatch. </strong>The USA's Erinn Smart beat Martina Emanuel 15 pts-7 pts. Still, fencing's never as good to watch as you'd think it would be.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>Brit in the Philippines, Al Parkes,</strong> \"sympathises with the Brit in Kiwiland about the beach volleyball (had to endure hours of it here in Philippines, yesterday, too) but not about the boxing - we also got hours of that, but that's ok by me...\" I'm with you, Al. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/10/olympicsboxing.olympics20081\">Billy Jo Saunders</a>. What a guy.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>5.50 am:</strong> Just cos a few of you have asked about it. The medal table... It's nowt to do with me. It's been outsourced. No, really.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>5.55 am:</strong><strong> Badminton. </strong>In a seismic shuttlecock shock unseeded Japanese duo Maeda Miyuki and Suetsuna Satoko eliminated defending Olympic champions Yang Wei and Zhang Jiewen in the women's doubles. All eyes (and excruciating pressure) on men's top seed Lin Dan, who plays unseeded Ng Wei of Hong Kong. And Chinese tv watch, Steve George, reckons \"Joanna Harris should consider herself lucky, yesterday Chinese state television appeared to show nothing but 9 hours of back to back power lifting.\"</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>6.05 am:</strong> <strong>Swimming. </strong>It's been a great day in the pool. Brits <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/11/swimming.olympics.britain\">Rebecca Aldington and Jo Jackson</a> brought home gold and bronze medals in the 400m freestyle. Though, sadly, there was no resurrection for Athens finalist Laure Manaudou. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/11/swimming.olympics.britain\">Marina Hyde</a>, wrote a fine piece on her extraordinary story in today's big paper. There's been plenty of drama. And at 7am 14 year-old Tom Daley will make his Olympic debut. Paul Kelso will be blogging from the poolside at 7. Join him <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/11/tom_daleys_olympic_debut_live.html \">here</a>.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>6.15 am:</strong> <strong>Tennis. </strong>After a flat middle period, Rafael Nadal took the third set and the game to defeat Italian minnow Potito Starace. <strong>Women's basketball. </strong>The Czech Republic destroyed Mail 81-47.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>6.20 am:</strong> Foreign news round-up one. <strong>Weightlifting. </strong>Just looking through the foreign papers, if Laure Manaudou was the melodramatic/tragic story, Turkish weightlifter Sibel Ozkan is one of the uplifting ones. As you might remember, Ozkan came from nowhere to win silver in the surprisingly fruity 48kg medal class behind Chinese No.1 Chen Xiexia on the first day of the games. Raised in state care, she dedicated the medal to her dead mother as she was made 'State Sportsman' and received 2,000 gold pieces (worth about \u00a3240,000) from the Turkish government.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>6.30 AM:</strong> Foreign news round-up two. <strong>Swimming. </strong> The IOC have accepted the explanation of an Iranian swimmer, Mohammad Alirezaei, who withdrew from the heats of the men's 100-meter breaststroke on Saturday just before he was due to compete against a field that included Israel's Tom Beeri. Iran could have faced sanctions from the IOC if Alirezaei pulled out deliberately because an Israeli was also racing, but the IOC said no violation had been found.<br>\"The athlete has withdrawn because of sickness,\" said a spokesman. \"He confirmed this in writing to the swimming federation. We've also spoken with the national Olympic committee and they have underlined to us that all their athletes compete here in the right spirit against athletes from any nationality.\" Iran does not recognize Israel and bans any contact with the Jewish state. At the 2004 Athens Olympics, an Iranian judo athlete did not compete against an Israeli opponent, and Iranian government officials were quoted in state media as congratulating him for doing so.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>6.40 am:</strong> <strong>Britwatch. </strong> Charlotte Kerwood's Olympics is over, after finishing 16th in the qualifying for the women's trap final. Kerwood made her international debut at the Manchester Commonwealth games at the age of 15, she's a 21 year-old veteran now and a definite maybe for London 2012. Slovakia's Zuzana Stefecekova and Finland's Satu Makela-Nummela led the field.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>Good morning, Gary Naylor. </strong> \"Catching up with the MBM Olympic report isn't easy pre-coffee, and is made all the more difficult by surprise medals,\" writes the undisputed Sir Steve Redgrave of the MBM Olympics. \"Things were easier when Team GB used to win just the one gold in the whole Games. This \"another day, another gold\" is all a bit much to be honest. Lewis Hamilton is shelving his Sports Personality of the Year acceptance speech for another year.\" I think Rebecca Aldington will need the 800m as well to secure that Sports Personality nomination, no? But Tom Daley has got the Young Sports Personality sewn up.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>6.50 AM:</strong> <strong>Brit-in-the-Baltics-perspective.</strong> Robin Hazlehurst in Estonia writes, \"Here in Estonia the national broadcaster has set up a second channel specially to show the Olympics, and now both channels are simultaneously showing beach volleyball, presumably just because Georgia are playing and this is an act of anti-Russian solidarity. There's no other reason, noone here cares about beach volleyball otherwise.\" You know, Kakum\u00e4e, V\u00e4\u00e4na-J\u00f5esuu and Lohusalu...

Anyway, get the rest of the news to date by signing up to our free email. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/series/thebeijinger\">The Beijinger</a>. Next up we have Tom Daley in the pool. <a href=\"http://www.televisionheaven.co.uk/minder.htm\">Not Minder</a>. But the the 14 year-old diving sensation. <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/11/tom_daleys_olympic_debut_live.html\">Paul Kelso</a> is at poolside now.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>Not everyone is excited about the diving, though.</strong> Not curmudgeonly Gary Naylor, for example. \"I know the IOC has all kinds of rules and regs (which essentially reduce to \"Will it work on telly?\")\", says Gary. \"But, ontologically, what is sport? For me anything that involves judges awarding points is more suited to a variant of the Eurovision Song Contest rather than the Olympics.\"</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>Brit-in-the-antipodes-perspective III.</strong> <strong>Swimming. </strong>How the Australian media reported Rebecca Adlington's race. \"In the excitement of jumping up and down and going \"Yes! Yes! Yes!\" for a while I forgot about the TV commentary on the 400m freestyle, over here in Australia,\" writes Martin Lyons. \"About 200m in (when Rebecca Adlington was last) the Aussie commentator was listing the top 3 swimmers, followed up by hyping the Australian in the race (who eventually came 6th) and then said \"as for the Brit Adlington, she's gone\", to which the other commentator replied \"Yeah, they've chewed her up and spat her out\".\"</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>7.30 am:</strong> <strong>Swimming. </strong>Britain are underway. Aldridge and 14 year-old Daley score 52.8 on their first dive. Highly impressive. Just to let you know how it works - there are eight teams in the final - Australia, Cuba, Great Britain, Germany, USA, Colombia, China and Russia. Each pair performs six dives in rotation. China who have won 20 of the 32 titles in Olympic history are red hot favourites. Bronze would be a result for our (literally) boys.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>7.40 am:</strong> <strong>Swimming. </strong>At the end of the first round China, lead from Russia and Australia, Germany and Britain, Blake Aldridge and Tom Daley, are tied fourth. The dives get progressively harder...</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>7.45 am:</strong> And the second Aldridge and Daley dive is a 50.4. This dive is a inward one-and-a-half somersault with pike. To my eyes, a bit out of time. (Though still mind-blowing.)</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>7.50 am:</strong> <strong>Swimming. </strong>Several million eyes are on a boy from Devon with verruca socks and his partner whose name is destined to be forgotten. (It's Blake Aldridge.) How's he doing? Pretty well. At the end of the second round GB lie sixth. China lead, Russia are second and Australia and Germany are tied third. The Chinese are simply miles ahead. Their pair of divers look like they are tied together by string.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>7.55 am:</strong> <strong>Swimming. </strong>Aldridge and Daley's third dive is a inward three-and-a-half-somersault tuck. The experts say they messed up the entry into the pool. It's a 72.96. Now it's time for a change in the hot seat. I'm off to bed and in comes Paolo Bandini, who I give a perfect 10.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>8am:</strong> Hello. I'll be tiding you over for the next three hours of tucks, pikes and ... er ... kayaking. All the focus is on the synchronised diving right now, but - if my hastily thrown together schedule is to be believed - we also have 49er and Yngling events kicking off just about now (Team GB involvement alert!), women's 58kg weightlifting and the trap final of the women's shooting.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>8.05am</strong> Fans of our ever-present standfirst (the grey bit underneath the headline) will already have spotted this, but for those who haven't, Paul Kelso is <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/11/tom_daleys_olympic_debut_live.html\"> giving the diving a far more knowledgeable treatment in his live blog</a>.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>8.10am</strong><strong>diving</strong> An impressively synchronised triple somersault (\"inward three-and-a-half tuck\", apparently) draws excited praise from our BBC commentary team, but there's a ruffle of the nose from Daley as he and Aldridge are awarded just 75.24 for their efforts. That leaves them seventh.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>8.12am</strong> Are they really playing Cotton-Eye Joe in the Bird's Nest? <em>Really</em>?</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>8.16am</strong> I've always figured that a bronze medal must often be more satisfying than a silver. If you finish third then you're probably just going to have been pleased to have picked up a medal at all, rather than dwelling on the fact that you came so close to a gold but didn't get it. As if on cue to back up my half-baked theories, this story about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/feedarticle/7715689\">Chinese shooter Zhu Qinan weeping on the podium</a> after picking up silver in the 10m air rifle drops into my lap.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>8.19am</strong> <strong>Diving:</strong> Daley and Aldridge synchronise beautifully again, but they're not entering the water quite right, so again it's only a 77.52. Hopes of a medal are fading.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>8.24am</strong> \"That's an interesting theory you have about coming second/third,\" jabbers Joseph Bennett. \"But isn't the more interesting point here really just how much more pleasant life must be as a lottery-funded Brit rather than a Chinese competitor at these Games. Daley and Aldridge will probably get a heroes' welcome back home if they finish within five places of the podium.\" Yes, that too.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>8.27am</strong> Team GB's women's eight have finished second behind USA (repeat three times for emphasis) in the rowing, and will therefore have to get through the repechage tomorrow if they want a place in the final.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>8.29am</strong> Another splashy entry from the Brits, and they'll be lucky not to finish last now.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>8.37am</strong> \"Daley and Aldridge?\" exclaims Gary Naylor. \"Please don't write it like that. Those of us of a certain age are getting flashbacks to 80s football (Tony Daley and John Aldridge) and it's not very nice.\" It's alright Gary, I won't mention them again now, what with how they've finished in eighth. A dodgy last dive from China gives Russia a shot at gold, but it was only ever an extremely unlikely one and they can't manage it. Instead, Germany leap up to grab silver, and the Russians must settle for bronze. Which will, of course, be far more satisfying (see 8.16am).</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>8.42am</strong> The Beeb is showing replays of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/11/swimming.olympics.britain\">Rebecca Adlington's gold in the 400m freestyle\"</a>, so this seems as good a time as any to plug our <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/series/thebeijinger\">informative daily Beijinger email</a>. It's full of fun, facts, and the word 'Olympics'.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>8.50am</strong> It's 64-64 in the women's preliminary basketball game between Russia and Korea, while the Italian Valentina Vezzali is through to the semi-finals of the women's fencing. If she can parry, riposte and perform various other sword-swishing motions better than fellow Italian Margherita Granbassi in the semi-final, and then one more opponent in the final, she'll become the first Italian ever to win gold at three different Olympics. That opponent could actually be yet another Italian, since Giovanna Trillini is in the other semi-final against Nam Hyunhee.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>9am</strong> Team GB's 49er team Stevie Morrison and Ben Rhodes are ninth with 41 points, which sounds like quite a lot behind Australia's Nathan Outteridge and Ben Austin on 13, but then I don't really understand how this is scored if I'm being honest. Explanations welcomed and appreciated. My colleague Alan Gardner has just walked in with an outrageous new moustache. It's quite distracting.</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>9.05am</strong> The moustache is apparently in honour of Mark Spitz, the American swimmer whose seven gold medals in 1972 set the record which Michael Phelps is now trying to break. Alan thinks <a href=\"http://images.beijing2008.cn/01/75/Img211717501.jpg\">Spitz's was the greatest sporting moustache of all time</a>. For me the <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/i/page2/photos/040414hrabosky.jpg\">former Atlanta Braves pitcher Al Hrabowsky</a> takes some beating.</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>9.10am</strong> Back to the sailing and Ben Ainslie is doing rather well in the Finn. In fact he's won four of his last five races and is first on just seven points. Not bad for a man who said he was going to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/11/olympicssailing.olympics2008\">play it safe</a></p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>9.16am</strong> Britain's Alan Campbell is fourth in the quarter-finals of the men's single sculls but moving up through the field ...</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>9.17am</strong> And in the end he pushes on to finish a comfortable second behind Germany's Marcel Hacker, who looks very pleased with himself indeed. Hacker has been waiting quite some time to get one over on Campbell, but I dare say the Brit was fairly sensible to just pace himself and settle for second, given that there's still a semi-final and potentially a final to come.</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>9.21am</strong> I'm hoping Gary Naylor had his tongue firmly in his cheek when he put forward <a href=\"http://img.skysports.com/08/03/800x600/GaryNeville_724859.jpg\">Gary Neville's shameful attempt at face fluff</a> for our great sporting moustaches contest. France's Gael Monfils is through to the second round of the men's tennis after beating Spain's Nicolas Almagro 6-4, 3-6, 6-3. Britain's very own Andy Murray is up at 10am against Chinese Taipei's Yen-Hsun Lu, who is currently ranked No77 in the world. They have never met before on the ATP Tour.</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>9.30am</strong> Al Parkes is not the first person to suggest Merve Hughes for our moustache contest, <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/ffximage/2006/12/20/mervehughes_narrowweb__300x361,0.jpg\">but he did include the best link</a>. Those of you wanting a break from all this moustache malarkey could do worse than checking out Barney Ronay's <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/11/premier_league_preview_no11_ma.html\">Premier League preview on Manchester United</a></p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>9.32am</strong> Britain's 'three blondes' - Sarah Ayton, Sarah Webb and Pippa Wilson - finished fourth in the fifth race of the women's yngling, leaving them joint-first with the Netherlands on 13 points.</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>9.40am</strong> Apologies for the slightly belated reporting here, but Finland's Satu Makela-Nummela took gold in the women's trap shooting earlier on, and even set an Olympic record along the way by hitting 21 targets in the final. Slovakia's Zuzana Stefecekova took silver and USA's Corey Cogdell took bronze.</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>9.46am</strong> You* will be excited to hear that Italy are through to the finals of the men's archery after crushing Ukraine 223-221. In more sombre news, Anatoly Khrapaty, a weight-lifting gold medallist for the USSR in 1988, has been killed at the age of just 45 in a motorcycle accident. </p> <p>* I</p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p><strong>9.50am</strong> It's all coming up Italy right now - I've just found out they've also beaten Russia in a women's water polo preliminary too. Russia finally overcame Korea 77-72 in the women's basketball, while Latvia are 13-12 up against Belarus in the same event.</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>9.54am</strong> Gary Naylor's back, and this time he's angry. \"Women's trap shooting? Why a separate competition,\" he booms. \"Likewise archery and indeed several other sports - anachronistic nonsense. Women and men should compete against each other on a 'level playing field' unless there are proveable physical reasons why the playing field isn't level (eg swimming, athletics etc).\"</p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>10am</strong> The official Beijing website is utterly useless when it comes to sailing results - right now they have nothing up for any of the races, beyond a starting list of competitors and the word 'unofficial' where the results should be. Our super newswires, however, inform me that Ainslie did indeed finish the day in first place as did the women's yngling team \"after another pair of solid performances\". They boast leads of one and three points respectively. In the 49er class, however, Stevie Morrison and Ben Rhodes, managed to slip from first to ninth despite being the 2007 world champions.</p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p><strong>10.05am</strong> There's windsurfing news too - Britain's Bryony Shaw, who won the test event here last year, is third in the RS:X women's category, while Nick Dempsey is ninth in the men's competition.</p> <!-- Block 82 --> <p><strong>10.10am</strong> \"David Wilkie was just a bit behind Spitz in gold medals and face furniture,\" pipes up Gary Naylor, putting his equal-opportunities bluster behind him to get back to the more pressing issue of facial hair. \"<a href=\"http://cache.viewimages.com/xc/3318044.jpg?v=1&amp;c=ViewImages&amp;k=2&amp;d=11B127B063386F61C80E5920C1CC8592A55A1E4F32AD3138\">Decent effort on both counts though</a>.\"</p> <!-- Block 83 --> <p><strong>10.15am</strong> Ah kayaking - like rowing, only better (strong current, white water, high potential for drowning - what's not to like)? Campbell Walsh was supposed to be one of Britain's biggest medal hopes here, having taken silver in Athens, but a dodgy first run, picking up two penalty points. He's ninth at the minute and needs to stay in the top 15 after two runs to progress.</p> <!-- Block 84 --> <p><strong>10.20am</strong> Murray is 2-1 up, but I've been disappointed by the lack of over-enthusiastic middle-England support. Perhaps they're being drowned out by both players' absurdly squeaky shoes. Not enough fist pumping for my liking either.</p> <!-- Block 85 --> <p><strong>10.25am</strong> Walsh has finished 14th in the first round of the K1. Not great.</p> <!-- Block 86 --> <p><strong>10.30am</strong> A big thank-you to Gavin Brown, who has pointed me in the direction of <a href=\"www.sailing.org/olympics\">this website</a>, which seems to be fairly comprehensive and up to speed when it comes to the sailing results. They're all done for today now anyway, but will doubtless come in handy again over the next few days. Murray is 3-2 up and the match has so far gone with serve.</p> <!-- Block 87 --> <p><strong>10.32 am</strong> Scratch that - Murray just broke for the first time and leads 4-2.</p> <!-- Block 88 --> <p><strong>10.34am</strong> China's Chen Yanqing has won the women's 58kg weightlifting competition. They now have eight golds - five more than anybody else. China also claimed bronze in the men's team archery with a 222-219 win over Ukraine. Italy are playing Korea in the final now.</p> <!-- Block 89 --> <p><strong>10.38</strong> More good news for Team GB as David Florence finishes third after two heats in the C1 canoe slalom to make the semi-finals with ease.</p> <!-- Block 90 --> <p><strong>10.43</strong> Britain's men's coxless pair of Robin Bourne-Taylor and Tom Solesbury are out after finishing fourth in the repecharge.</p> <!-- Block 91 --> <p><strong>10.47am</strong> I return to the tennis to find that Murray has now broken Lu twice, only to swiftly drop his own serve on both occasions. He leads 5-4, with Lu serving to stay in the set.</p> <!-- Block 92 --> <p><strong>10.51am</strong> Korea have beaten Italy 227-225 in the final of the men's archery, which by my reckoning puts them second in the gold medal count with four.</p> <!-- Block 93 --> <p><strong>10.55am</strong> Murray really isn't making light work of things against Lu, and he is taken to deuce before holding serve to take a 6-5 lead. Britain's Elise Laverick and Anna Bebington are through to the final of the women's double sculls after winning the repecharge.</p> <!-- Block 94 --> <p><strong>11.05am</strong> The picture is ahead of the sound on the BBC's coverage of the Murray match, which makes for quite an odd viewing experience. I've watched sport before where the opposite is true, but never quite like this. Lu holds to force a tie-break after saving three set points on deuce. Murray's body language is not especially encouraging - it's very hot on court and he looks quite lethargic. He has relied heavily on unforced errors from Lu to this point.</p> <!-- Block 95 --> <p><strong>11.12am</strong> Lu takes the tie-break 7-5 to shrieks of what I can only assume is the Chinese equivalent of \"come on Tim\". It was a bizarre end to the set actually - Murray double-faulted, but there was confusion over whether his second serve had been called in or not and both players were made to hang about for a few minutes while the umpire called the Hawkeye team, only to discover it wasn't working. In the end Murray was told it had been called out, and that would stand. Anyway, Murray is in trouble here - he's really not playing that well. You, however, are in very good hands, as I am now passing this minute-by-minute over to my esteemed colleague Tom Bryant.</p> <!-- Block 96 --> <p><strong>11.20am:</strong> Morning all. As I take over typing duties, Campbell Walsh is bobbing about like a cork in a waterfall in the white waters of canoeing course. He finally crosses the line with 172.44 to come in fifth which should mean he qualifies for the next round - or say they're saying on the telly - I've been watching Andy Murray begin his inevitable first game exit from the Olympics so haven't been concentrating too hard.</p> <!-- Block 97 --> <p><strong>11.25am:</strong> There's wild excitement in the badminton court - or at least you'd think so from the terrifying chanting that appears to be going on there. Brit Andrew Smith is taking on Marc Zwieber and is currently one game up but losing the second 13-9. Andy Murray, meanwhile, is trying to get off the court as it's started raining but the umpire won't let him as he doesn't think it's hard enough.</p> <!-- Block 98 --> <p><strong>11.30am:</strong> In the badminton, Smith (who looks a bit like John Arne Riise) is taking the shuttle early at the front of the court which is a good thing, by all accounts. It doesn't help him save the second game, though, as Zwieber draws level on one game all The furious chanting is still going on but bears no relation to this game, which means there's probably a far more exciting one elsewhere in the building, albeit one that doesn't involve a Brit and is therefore not being shown by the Beeb.</p> <!-- Block 99 --> <p><strong>11.32am:</strong> Ah. An apology. All that badminton happened ages ago. At 4am. And Smith lost badly. That's the peril of assuming that what you're watching is live when it isn't. What a brilliant start I've made to all of this. In other news you may not have caught up on - the allies won the war and England won the 1966 World Cup.</p> <!-- Block 100 --> <p><strong>11.36am:</strong> Something that very much is happening at the moment is Andy Murray heading into that dark place in his head while some unknown shows him how to play tennis. He's 2-1 down in the second set, having lost the first two games and then breaking back.</p> <!-- Block 101 --> <p><strong>11.39am:</strong> Murray's problem are - apparently - his short balls. By which, he's not hitting the tennis ball far enough. Why? What were you thinking? Campbell Walsh, in the canoeing, qualified from his heat in ninth place, so that's a good thing.</p> <!-- Block 102 --> <p><strong>11.44am:</strong> An email. Hurrah. \"Do tennis players really take the Olympics seriously,\" asks Jim Thompson, not unreasonably given Murray's showing so far. \"Is winning a gold medal as important a spur to them as winning at somewhere like Wimbledon?\" I don't think it is, to be honest. I'm always surprised by how many big players turn out - but then, according to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/11/tennis.olympics.nadal\">this report from Will Buckley</a>, the Chinese love a bit of tennis.</p> <!-- Block 103 --> <p><strong>11.46pm:</strong> Sharron Davies is talking away on the telly about the fantastic success in the swimming this morning. The BBC cameraman is scrupulously zooming in very closely on her head, not allowing his lens to show anything but her face. <a href=\"http://observer.theguardian.com/osm/story/0,,1677787,00.html\">Wonder why that is</a>.</p> <!-- Block 104 --> <p><strong>11.51am:</strong> \"I think that the tennis players suffer The Olympics because of their sponsors' contracts,\" reckons Gary Naylor. \"They don't seem to care much and (perhaps I'm being charitable) look embarrassed about taking the limelight away from those for whom The Olympics is the pinnacle of their careers.\" Murray certainly looks like he's suffering at the moment - after an epic deuce battle to go back to 2-2 in the second set, he looks absolutely shattered and is spending a good deal of time grimacing as his gammy knee gives him jip.</p> <!-- Block 105 --> <p><strong>11.53am:</strong> Aside from the tennis, there's much going on at the moment. A quick glance shows lots of women in wetsuit-ish swimming costumes ploughing up and down the pool (where Brit Caitlan McClatchey has come second in the 200m freestyle heat), two women in judo suits grappling with each other and others playing hockey, sailing and jabbing at each other with swords. </p> <p>Also, there this: \"I agree with Gary Naylor that there is something not quite right about events which require judges to award points,\" says Paul Smith of the ever prodigious Mr Naylor's comments at just 7.20am this morning - proving that Paul Smith is just as much behind the times as I was a few minutes ago. \"Of more interest/concern though is that, as far as I can work out, diving is the only such event which has not been made into 'Celebrity Synchronised Diving'. No idea who would host it but some of the potential combinations are delicious - both technically and aesthetically.\" Any suggestions?</p> <!-- Block 106 --> <p><strong>12.05pm:</strong> The featherweight and lightweight boxing preliminaries are underway and Santos from Mexico and Okoth from Kenya are busy knocking seven shades out of each other. The Mexican is 3-2 up after the second round. Meanwhile Federica Pelligrini has just smashed the 200m freestyle world record after clocking 1min 55.45 seconds. Well done her.</p> <!-- Block 107 --> <p><strong>12.10pm:</strong> \"Further to the comments of Gary Naylor and Paul Smith re what defines a sport, I would like to say that if you can play it without changing your shoes, its not a sport,\" emails Jimmy Shaker - which, by that reckoning, makes diving a sport as you should probably remove your shoes before entering the pool. My assessment of what makes a sport is whether you can do it with a cigarette in your hand - therefore snooker, darts and cricket are not sports.</p> <!-- Block 108 --> <p><strong>12.15pm:</strong> It's going from bad to worse for Murray. Not only is it four games all in the second set, he's also battling fatigue, a bad knee and the inner demons to whom he seems to have started talking - going by the constant muttering with which he's greeting each point.</p> <!-- Block 109 --> <p><strong>12.17pm:</strong> Santos has clinched his bout about against Okoth and, with his face mask off, he appears to be all of about 10 years old. Elsewhere, Italian Giulia Quintavalle has claimed the gold in the women's 57kg judo after beating Deborah Gravenstijn from the Netherlands.</p> <!-- Block 110 --> <p><strong>12.21pm:</strong> World number 77, Lu Yen-Hsu, has just knocked Andy Murray out of the Olympics in straight sets. That really is appalling from Murray. Expect Murray to be referred to as only a Scot rather than a Briton for the next two weeks.</p> <!-- Block 111 --> <p><strong>12.25pm:</strong> The commentators are gamely talking up how well Lu Yen-Hsu has played - and rightfully so - but, honestly, Murray played shockingly badly. He barely looked interested, was as mobile as a sloth and seemed never to have really been in this. He'll be out later in the doubles with his brother, so he can have the ignominy of crashing out twice, if he carries on like this.</p> <!-- Block 112 --> <p><strong>12.30pm:</strong> Ah, the butterfly. The most ludicrous of swimming strokes. And isn't it always brilliant when someone down the municipal pool attempts it while you're lamely doggy paddling down the slow lane? Anyway, there's a 200m butterfly heat underway at the moment and the British interest involves Michael Rock who's not doing badly. In fact, he's done rather well and has finished in third with 1:55.55, which is just outside the British record and is a huge personal best.</p> <!-- Block 113 --> <p><strong>12.33pm:</strong> \"I think you're being harsh on Andy Murray,\" says Colin Stevens. \"The guy has just come through consecutive weeks of Masters tennis held in baking heat and humidity, winning one and getting to the semis in the other. Peter Fleming early on in the last tournament said that whoever won that would have no chance in the Olympics. Might be why Federer got knocked out early.\" Yeah, but to slump out to the world number 77 so lamely is what's depressing. There was just no fight.</p> <!-- Block 114 --> <p><strong>12.35pm:</strong> Phelps is off like a flailing dolphin in his 200m butterfly heat - well, like an extremely effective, winning machine-like flailing dolphin. He hit the turn on 150m in sixth and then came back to win in the last length and casually set a new Olympic record of 1:53.7 while he was at it. Extraordinary.</p> <!-- Block 115 --> <p><strong>12.39pm:</strong> \"Contrary to your comments, darts appears to be the ultimate sport,\" insists Kevin McKenzie. \"In competitions, you have to wear black shoes at the oche, you can no longer smoke indoors, and theres no judge deciding on your score. Could darts be the ultimate sport?\" Hmm, it's beating cricket under those terms. Meanwhile, Jo Jackson has joined Caitlin McClatchey in the semi-finals of the 200m freestyle after winning bronze this morning in the 400m freestyle. Good on her.</p> <!-- Block 116 --> <p><strong>12.41pm:</strong> The men's 62kg weightlifting is reaching its exciting pinnacle. There's a lot of shouting, a fair bit of grunting and some very peculiar body-shapes on display. 140kg is where the weight is at currently and a lot of men who I , personally, wouldn't mess with are struggling to lift it.</p> <!-- Block 117 --> <p><strong>12.47pm:</strong> The Korean Ji Hunmin is the talcum powder and shouting king currently. He's just lifted 142kg, something which the pleasingly alliterative Chinese contender, Zhang Xiangxiang, can't lift it himself, despite the entire crowd roaring at him. Meanwhile Chris Brock has sent me a very amusing email on the subject of one particular person who would make a worrying celebrity diving partner. Unfortunately, unless I want to spend the next few month of my life in court, I can't print it. Pity.</p> <!-- Block 118 --> <p><strong>12.49pm:</strong> Ah, but Xiangxiang has come out again and had another go, this time lifting 143kg. So, well done him.</p> <!-- Block 119 --> <p><strong>12.52pm:</strong> In the judo, Azerbaijan's Elnur Mammadli has clinched gold in the 73kg men's category after taking only 13 seconds to knock teenage world champion Wang Kichun of South Korea out of the reckoning. Tajikistan's Rasul Boqiev won bronze after beating Dirk van Tichelet of Belgium. My advice is to steer clear of all four of them if you ever see them in a bad mood.</p> <!-- Block 120 --> <p><strong>12.55pm:</strong> Back to the pool, where Brit Keri-Ann Payne has come in seventh in the 200m individual medley heat but was up at the front alongside hot favourite Natalie Coughlin for initial stages. Her time is good but maybe not good enough for the final. Hoff races in the next heat and she'll certainly be the person everyone wants to beat.</p> <!-- Block 121 --> <p><strong>12.59pm:</strong> Actually, the backstroke is quite silly too. Not as silly as the butterfly, but still fairly silly. Hoff possibly thinks so as her backstroke length lets her down a bit in the fourth of the women's 200m individual medley but, still she comes second to Australian Alicia Coutts. After that heat, Payne has slipped down to tenth but could still make the semis.</p> <!-- Block 122 --> <p><strong>1.04pm:</strong> Back in the boxing - the men's lightweight (60kg) round of 32: Match 4, to be absolutely precise - Domenico Valentino of Italy has creamed Tahar Tamsamani 15-4. He'll have a sore head in the morning. In the pool, Brit Hannah Miley has continued Team GB's good day in the pool by winning heat five of the 200m individual medley in a time of 2:11.72. She looks delighted with herself too, and well she might as she's now fourth in the semi-final. Payne is through too.</p> <!-- Block 123 --> <p><strong>1.09pm:</strong> \"Here in Sweden, the telly is showing some boxing where one of the competitors rejoices in the name Prince Octopus Dzaine,\" writes Gary Naylor of the Ghanaian boxer (it says on t'internet) . \"Disappointingly, he has just the two arms.\" It would be something of an unfair advantage should he have had eight, though extremely entertaining to warch.</p> <!-- Block 124 --> <p><strong>1.12pm:</strong> Bix Mistry has suggested: \"Dawn French and Peter Crouch, Darth Vader and an Ewok or Robert Mugabe and Gordon Brown,\" for the celebrity diving. I'd rather see Cristiano Ronaldo and Didier Drogba - they're certainly got form. Honk!</p> <!-- Block 125 --> <p><strong>1.18pm:</strong> Nikoloz Izoria and Thato Batshegi, from Georgia and Botswana respectively, are clattering each other all over the boxing ring. The Georgian is 10-4 ahead in the second round but manages to find time to stop and do up his shoe laces. He's also got a nasty graze under his eye. Bathshegi is going at him like a drunk on a Saturday night - all agression, flailing arms, wild attacks and not much contact - while Izoria is concentrating on actually doing some boxing.</p> <p>Unfortunately for British badminton player Tracey Hallam, her Olympics are over. She's been knocked out by Xu Huaiwen who, despite her name, mystifyingly appears to be from Germany.</p> <!-- Block 126 --> <p><strong>1.24pm:</strong> Batshegi has decided he's had enough of being punched in the head and has, instead, decided to wrestle Izoria to the ground. I'm no boxing expert but I'd say that's probably not Queensberry Rules. Next he batters the Georgian around the back of the head, which doesn't seem quite right either. </p> <p>On the subject of sports with judges, Phil Mannion has this to say: \"I once passed an enjoyable afternoon in the pub with a friend thinking of ways judging could be eliminated from sport. Most of our innovations now escape me, but I've always thought our re-imagining of synchronised swimming as a gruelling endurance slog, where the winners are the last team still underwater-pirouetting when the rest have given up/drowned, was potentially the same sort of televisual gold as Touch The Truck with Dale Winton.\"</p> <!-- Block 127 --> <p><strong>1.27pm:</strong> The referee has decided that the slight bruising to Izoria's eye is enough to stop the bout for a bit. He seems less concerned by the Botswanan's attempts to turn this into a wrestling contest, however. The scoring seems a bit iffy, too. Batshegi finally connected with a good punch and failed to score, before Izoria does the same three times more and doesn't get a point either. It finishes 14-4 to the Georgian.</p> <!-- Block 128 --> <p><strong>1.28pm:</strong> U-S-A, U-S-A are stomping all over China in the women's basketball and are currently up 45-14 with five minutes remaining in the half. Which half? I'm not sure at the moment.</p> <!-- Block 129 --> <p><strong>1.33pm:</strong> The Chinese are not going down without a fight though. Despite being about half the size of most of the Americans, they're giving it good go. It's not going to work though, I'd wager. U-S-A, U-S-A are now 54-22 ahead with only a minute and half to go of the half. Which half? Still don't know.</p> <!-- Block 130 --> <p><strong>1.37pm:</strong> Ah, it was the first half. China are out of this already. Let's move on somewhere else.</p> <!-- Block 131 --> <p><strong>1.38pm:</strong> Apologies again. It appears the website is not updating. So all of these carefully worded vignettes have not been appearing, which has probably only improved the overall report. Whether this apology will also appear is also in doubt - but it's the thought that counts, eh?</p> <!-- Block 132 --> <p><strong>1.45pm:</strong> Good lord, they're still lifting insane weights in what I can only presume is called the weight-lifting arena. Alliterative dream, Zhang Xiangxiang, is attempting to lift 184kg - a weight that would be a new world record. He's already the gold medal winner. He approaches the stand, looking knackered, scoops the weights up to his neck ... and ... drops them back on the floor, unable to lift them any higher. Still, that was a very impressive contest from the Chinaman.</p> <!-- Block 133 --> <p><strong>1.48pm:</strong> Ah, it would appear the site is working again. Good stuff. Right, in the men's 62kg weightlifting, the winner is Zhang Xiangxiang, Diego Salazar of Colombia can hang the silver medal from his mantelpiece, while Indonesia's Triyatno will have to settle for bronze.</p> <!-- Block 134 --> <p><strong>1.55pm:</strong> It's U-S-A, U-S-A against Romania in the boxing ring in the shape of Georgian Popescu v American teenager Sadam Ali and it's shaping up to be quite a bout for the Romanian. He's absolutely clonking Ali and has landed some weighty lefts on Ali's face - enough to knock the American to the floor. Going into the third round, Popescu leads 9-3, which means yet another American boxer could be on his way home.</p> <!-- Block 135 --> <p><strong>1.58pm:</strong> As boxing contests go, this is not the most technically brilliant. There have been one or two air shots, some wild, whirling arms and the odd landed punch - mostly from the American. In return, he's getting a real whooping. Popescu is absolutely killing him. At the end of the third, the Romanian leads 16-5. Ali needs a knockout or a miracle to stay in this.</p> <!-- Block 136 --> <p><strong>2.03pm:</strong> Some fencing news: Margherita Granbassi from Italy has beaten fellow Italian Giovanni Trillini to the bronze medal in the women's individual foil by 15 points to 12. Meanwhile, Popescu has finished his demolition of Ali and will no doubt take a certain amount of pleasure in having sent the second American boxer of the contest back home.</p> <!-- Block 137 --> <p><strong>2.07pm:</strong> Ah - the mystery of the badminton player who is mystifyingly German despite all the evidence of her name name has been solved. Xu Huaiwen was a Chinese citizen who was dropped by the Chinese team because she was too short. She moved to Germany, got into their team, and is now back in China showing her homeland what they have missed out on. None of which changes things for Briton Tracey Hallam, who Xu beat, as she's still on her way home.</p> <!-- Block 138 --> <p><strong>2.12pm:</strong> Having written the Chinese women basketball players off, they're doing their best to make me eat my words. At the end of the third quarter they've fought back to leave the score at 46-81 to U-S-A. They can still count on packing their unfeasibly long t-shirts and shorts tonight but they'll do so having put on a decent showing.</p> <!-- Block 139 --> <p><strong>2.17pm:</strong> There's some hot breaking women's beach volleyball news ... well, it's news, anyway. In the preliminary competition, pool C, match 3, Ana Paula Connelly and Larissa Franca (Brazil) beat Paula Uryadova and Alexandra Shiryaeva (Russia) 2-1 (19-21 21-12 15-13). Take that down the pub and impress your mates.</p> <!-- Block 140 --> <p><strong>2.20pm:</strong> Elsewhere, Maria Valentina Vezzali has won he women's individual foil gold after beating South Korea's Nam Hyun-hee (who took silver). She's a bit special, is Maria Valentina and this gold means she's taken that medal home at three individual Olympics. Sort of like the Steve Redgrave of Italy. But in fencing. And not quite as good.</p> <!-- Block 141 --> <p><strong>2.30pm:</strong> The tennis courts are swelteringly hot - leading to players having to change their shirts constantly throughout. That's the reason Murray did so badly earlier, apparently. Hmmm. On the court at the moment Svetlana Kuznetsova is a set down against Li Na, but two games up in the second set.</p> <!-- Block 142 --> <p><strong>2.35pm:</strong> We'll see just how worn out Andy Murray is when he comes on to the court alongside brother Jamie a bit later on. Meanwhile Li Na is banking on home support to get her through her match against Kuznetsova. The Chinese woman is absolutely throwing the kitchen sink at her rival and, so far, it seems to be working.</p> <!-- Block 143 --> <p><strong>2.40pm:</strong> \"Grrr,\" \"Ungghh,\" \"Oof,\" \"Owwwll,\" or noises to that affect are what you'd be hearing if you were watching Kuznetsova try and get back on level terms with Li Na, where the score is now two games-all in the second set.</p> <!-- Block 144 --> <p><strong>2.44pm:</strong> Valentina Vezzali says her unprecedented fencing success is down to her son Pietro. \"I have to first off all thank my little boy Pietro,\" without going on to elaborate. Still, that's her third successive gold and sixth overall - the most for any female fencer ever.</p> <!-- Block 145 --> <p><strong>2.49pm:</strong> Bad news in the tennis - well, bad news if you happen to be defending men's doubles champions Fernando Gonzalez and Nicolas Massu of Chile. They were beaten 7-6 6-4 by Russians Dmitry Tursunov and Mikhail Youzhny. In Athens Gonzalez and Massu won Chile its first ever gold medal but obviously couldn't repeat the feat again. The Murrays are due up in five minutes - any predictions for how many times Andy will shout at his older brother?</p> <!-- Block 146 --> <p><strong>2.56pm:</strong> It's bad news for Kuznetsova, too. She's looking thoroughly deflated. Despite being the world number 3, she's in the process of crashing out of the Olympics to the Chinese number two Li Na. \"The question is not how many times Andy Murray will shout at his brother but how soon,\" reckons Tim carter. \"I'm banking on the abuse starting in the changing room.\"</p> <!-- Block 147 --> <p><strong>2.58pm:</strong> Li Na, who has barely cracked a smile all match, doesn't appear to be dropping the hardman exterior now. She looks positively stony-faced as she fails to finish this match off. She's 5-3 up in the second set and stuck on deuce. Meanwhile, U-S-A have finally completed their rout over the Chinese women's basketball team, winning 108-63. That was probably quite inevitable.</p> <!-- Block 148 --> <p><strong>3.01pm:</strong> Kuznetsova comes back to win the game, bringing the score to 5-4. In the background, Chumbawumba's (whose tour bus I once climbed into, for no real reason) Tubthumping blares out of the arena's PA. I cannot think of a single reason why that should be.</p> <!-- Block 149 --> <p><strong>3.04pm:</strong> And Li Na's finally done it and has won in straight sets. Well done her. Still doesn't make her smile though. Should you want to know what it's like to row at the Olympics, you could do a lot worse than clicking <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/11/one_down_two_to_go_in_my_quest.html\">here</a>.</p> <!-- Block 150 --> <p><strong>3.07pm:</strong> The Murrays are on court and facing Canadian pairing Daniel Nestor and Frederic Nestor. Andy looks knackered, Jamie not so much. But, despite a stunning series of net-cord volleying from the Murrays when 15-30 up in the first game, the Canadians go on to get th first points on the board.</p> <!-- Block 151 --> <p><strong>3.15pm:</strong> It's a game-all now in the men's doubles, and there's been a disappointing lack of on-court shouting so far. Ah well, there's still time.</p> <!-- Block 152 --> <p><strong>3.17pm:</strong> In the cricket, Freddie Flintoff has just won the game for England with a big, straight six, so England win by six wickets. In Beijing, Albert Selimov, the favourite in the featherweight division, has just been knocked out - of the competition, not knocked unconscious - by Ukraine's Vasyl Lomachenko. That'll hurt.</p> <!-- Block 153 --> <p><strong>3.19pm:</strong> Rather than shouting, the Murrays are whispering to each other behind their hands like the Williams sisters. It seems to be working as every one of the four games they've played has gone with serve. It's 2-2 and Andy Murray has already got quite a sweat on.</p> <!-- Block 154 --> <p><strong>3.25pm:</strong> It's with a peculiar \"Phheee\" sound that Nestor unleashes his serves. It seems to do the trick, though. He wins that game for the Canadians to love. The arena is virtually empty, showing you just how much the Chinese care about this. Andy Murray then slaps down a decent, if half-hearted, service game to level the scores at 3-3 again. I'm not sure he really cares much about this.</p> <!-- Block 155 --> <p><strong>3.29pm:</strong> The Canadian pair, rather than just whisper under their breath, are indulging in a series of complicated hand signals which seem to be confusing them as much as anything else. It's like doing semaphore to a blind man. It means the Murrays get themselves three break points - all of which they blow - before the game goes to deuce and the Canadians hold serve again.</p> <!-- Block 156 --> <p><strong>3.34pm:</strong> There are a pitiful handful of spectators watching this game - all of whom seem to be middle-aged women from the home counties. Strange. They watch on as Jamie Murray holds his serve, taking the score to 4-4 in the first set. Russia, meanwhile, have beaten Sweden 28-24 in the handball preliminary round, you'll be pleased to learn.</p> <!-- Block 157 --> <p><strong>3.41pm:</strong> It would appear the site has gone down again. Bah. Stay with us, it'll get better. Maybe. </p> <p>Canada survive a Murray pummeling, thanks to Nestor's excellent anticipation. What appeared to be an unplayable Andy Murray shot down the line was amazingly returned by the Canadian. Two points later, with the scores at deuce, Andy lets out his first shout. \"Rraarrr,\" he yells as he screws his shot into the net. He does the same thing a little later when he puts another into the net as Canada take the game. The score's 5-4 to them, now.</p> <!-- Block 158 --> <p><strong>3.45pm:</strong> Facing three set points, after going 0-40 down at 4-5, Andy Murray throws the ball into the air and smashes it far too long. His second serve goes straight into the net and the Canadians claim the first set. Murray 'celebrates' by smashing his racket into the ground, while his brother just looks despairing.</p> <!-- Block 159 --> <p><strong>3.50pm:</strong> Should you get tired of the, ahem, word pictures being drawn here, you can look at actual pictures <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/gallery/2008/aug/11/olympics2008\">here</a> of the best shots from day three of the Olympics. On the court, you'd struggle to find anyone looking less bothered than the Murray's right now. Despite Andy's ocasional shouts and racket slams, they don't look like they could care less. Having said that, they have just broken the Canadians in the first game of the second set.</p> <!-- Block 160 --> <p><strong>3.54pm:</strong> Sean Ingle has spent much of his afternoon chasing new British swimming hero Rebecca Adlington around Beijing. The results? He rekons she's quite nice. You can make your own mind up by following <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/11/the_joy_of_the_olympics_is_how.html\">this link</a>, of course.</p> <!-- Block 161 --> <p><strong>3.57pm:</strong> Finally, the Murrays are beginning to make a fist of this. They fight back from 15-40 down to get to deuce - courtesy of a Nestor double fault - but can't go on to break the pair again. It's 2-1 to the Murrays who are still a set down in the second set. Meanwhile long-jumper Chris Tomlinson has passed a fitness test and has been passed fit to compete in Beijing - which is good news.</p> <!-- Block 162 --> <p><strong>4pm:</strong> Hmm, or perhaps I've spoken too soon. The next game, on Andy's serve, finds the brothers at 0-40 down. They fight back to 30-40 but a brilliant return from Nestor brings the scores level. That's the second service game that Andy Murray has lost.</p> <!-- Block 163 --> <p><strong>4.03pm:</strong> The Murrays break back, as the strains of a cover version of Sweet Child O'Mine blare from the speakers in the empty tennis arena. The score is 3-2 to the Scottish pair in the second set.</p> <!-- Block 164 --> <p><strong>4.10pm:</strong> Jamie Murray just about manages to cling on to his serve, taking the score to 4-2. It really is extraordinary how few people are watching this game. It may not be the greatest game tennis has ever seen but Andy Murray is a big name and Nestor, for one, is a very good doubles player so you'd have thought it would be more of a draw than it's proving. Perhaps it needs more trick shots - something Andy tries when he returns a Nestor forehand by facing the wrong way and playing the ball behind his back.</p> <!-- Block 165 --> <p><strong>4.16pm:</strong> After the Canadians hold their serve, the Murrays maintain their advantage after a a brutal, two-handed forehand club from the net from Jamie Murray wins them the next game. They're 5-3 up in the second set now and facing Niemeyer's serve.</p> <!-- Block 166 --> <p><strong>4.20pm:</strong> The Murrays land themselves with two set points but can do nothing with the first when Niemeyer forces Jamie Murray wide with his serve. His lobbed return is smashed back by Nestor before Niemeyer serves up an ace to Andy take the score to deuce. From deuce, the Murrays battle to advantage and win the second set. Game on.</p> <!-- Block 167 --> <p><strong>4.25pm:</strong> The first people to jump on the/cash in on the Adlington band-wagon are ... Sherwood Swimming Baths in Mansfield Woodhouse. The pool at which the Olympic gold medallist learned to swim aged six will be closed down and reopened as the Rebecca Adlington Swimming Centre, according to the town mayor. Adlington will also be pleased to know she will be able to do such things as drive sheep through the city centre when she's given the Freedom Of Mansfield, too. That medal will soon begin to look worthless in the face of such honours.</p> <!-- Block 168 --> <p><strong>4.30pm:</strong> The first two games of the set go with service, making the score 1-1, though Niemeyer's serve is looking ever-more vulnerable. The Murrays still don't look particularly interested in this but at least they're putting together some decent shots now. They are, however, barely looking or talking to each other - leading to speculation in the commentary box that Jamie is worried about annoying Andy and sending him into a rage after his defeat this morning.</p> <!-- Block 169 --> <p><strong>4.35pm</strong> Nestor has to battle to win his serve after finding himself staring down the wrong end of a 0-40 scoreline. The Canadians get back to 15-40, before Nestor double faults and the Murrays go 3-1 ahead.</p> <!-- Block 170 --> <p><strong>4.38pm:</strong> The Murrays have this within their sights now. They're now 4-1 up in the final set and, despite both looking as glum as octogenarian pessimists, they're finally got their mojo working. They've also got Niemeyer's serve to face, which has been weak so far.</p> <!-- Block 171 --> <p><strong>4.45pm:</strong> But Niemeyer holds his serve for once, forcing Andy Murray into s service game in which both Canadians return well. A mistake by Jamie Murray at the net doesn't much help his brother's cause. Andy decides to blast a couple of serves instead and the result is that the Murrays take the game and go into a 5-2 lead. It's 11.45pm in Beijing at the moment - which perhaps explains why nobody is watching this.</p> <!-- Block 172 --> <p><strong>4.48pm:</strong> A delicate drop shot down the line takes the Canadians to 40-15 and prolongs this match by another game. After typing solidly for six hours, I could have done without that, to be honest. Bah. Hopefully Jamie Murray can serve it out for the win nd we can all go home.</p> <!-- Block 173 --> <p><strong>4.53pm:</strong> An ace at 15-15 from Jamie starts the ball rolling but then, at 30-15, they concoct some elaborate plan that involves much talking behind hands before cocking up the point like clowns. Next minute the Canadians are 30-40 up and the damn match looks like it will never die. Then, just as it's all going wrong, Andy Murray dives across the net and slams Niemeyer's return home with a war cry. It's deuce ...</p> <!-- Block 174 --> <p><strong>4.54pm:</strong> ... and inevitably the Canadians break back and prolong this misery. It's 5-4 to the Murrays in the third set.</p> <!-- Block 175 --> <p><strong>4.55pm:</strong> A double fault from Niemeyer. Yes! That helps. He follows it up by sticking a half-volley into the net. 0-30 to the Murrays.</p> <!-- Block 176 --> <p><strong>4.59pm:</strong> With a sharp forehand, Andy Murray takes the score to 0-40 and brings the demise of this damn game nearer ... until the Canadians ruin it by having the temerity to win a point from their own serve. Then, ridiculously, they do it again. But, finally, the Murrays claim the win and they're through to the next round. You'd have thought that would cheer Andy Murray up after his loss earlier. From the grimace on his face, you'd be wrong.</p> <!-- Block 177 --> <p><strong>5pm:</strong> And with that, so ends this epic Olympic minute-by-minute. Thanks for all your emails - join as again for another one, which we'll be gearing up at around 2am tomorrow morning.</p>",
  "<p>We're in a heatwave, so hot that it's a real effort to cross the garden from my study, which is a slightly dangerous place as it's full of winged insect life, including horseflies and blowflies, which means there's a corpse somewhere about, I suppose. Let's hope it's in the bushes outside, not actually in here, a dead mouse or vole rotting underneath my desk, by my feet, or the corpse of my most recently uncompleted masterpiece rotting away in a drawer. There are also bees, wasps and hornets, not swarms of them, of course, they come in singles, twos and threes, then drift about in the corners of this small room, or become suddenly animated, and beat against the wire mesh I have over the windows, before drifting off again. I try sporadically to usher them out through the door, which I have to have open, in the hope of catching a bit of breeze, any whiff of living air in this inert weight of heat, but even if I succeed they come straight back in, as if their understanding is that they belong here, that my study is really a kind of public nest, like a bus shelter, say, where they can hang out until inclined to return to their private quarters. I wouldn't mind, really, if I didn't hate the thought of blowflies, and weren't nervous of being stung by wasps. The last time I was stung by a wasp, on a small boat in Greek waters about 10 years ago, I went into shock, and had to be carried, on the point of death I was subsequently told, in a slow, unresponsive ambulance over mountains and through flocks of goats and herds of wild horses to a hospital which was in its hygienic arrangement more lethal than a wasp sting. Actually, it may not have been the wasp sting that caused me to pass out, simultaneously vomiting and squittering on the deck of the small boat, but the sea urchin I was eating while I was being stung, it had an odd taste. And actually it may not have been the sea urchin or the wasp sting, it may have been alcohol poisoning, which is what one of the doctors claimed in the hospital - gathering his students around him he stabbed his forefinger at me with ill-humoured contempt and gave a lecture, a brief, scathing lecture. I only understood those words we share with them, alcohol being one of them. His students nodded and laughed mutteringly at the old English guy between the tattered and grubby sheets who was dehydrated from being poisoned by let's say the lot, insect and crustacean and alcohol.</p> <p>Victoria thought she could see a nest in the roof above my door, another of wasps or hornets around the side, and a nest of bees at the back. \"You mean that they all, wasps, hornets and bees, get on with each other!\" I exclaimed, sniffing a moral in it, to do with possibly the present situation in the Middle East. \"If wasps, hornets and bees can live in harmony so close to each other - Where are you going?\" She said she was going into the house, to telephone pest control. \"What do they do?\" I asked. \"Get rid of them, I hope,\" she said. So any moral to do with politics and the Middle East would have to find a role for the pest controller.</p> <p>The pest controller was a very pleasing man, we thought, short, balding and neat, with an academical, almost professorial manner. He spoke in long, easy sentences, rather like an accomplished television expert. He walked quickly around my study, identifying the nests pretty well where Victoria had identified them, then he donned his uniform, a sort of loose helmet with a transparent mask over his face, so that he could see through the cloud of chemical he was about to squirt through a hose attached to a canister. He explained what he was about to do, and sent us, for our own protection, to the kitchen. He joined us there in under five minutes, having destroyed the nests of bees, hornets, wasps. This is how he did it, as far as I could glean, and anything I didn't glean was my failure, because he spoke in the relaxed, confidential manner I've described above, eloquently and informatively - the chemicals he squirted into the wasps' nest would be picked up by the feet of the worker wasps as they went into the nest to groom the queen, so of course when they groomed the queen they'd be grooming her with poisonous feet, she would die, then without a queen they would die partly from the poison partly from redundancy, loss of purpose, I suppose, or grief. He was quite clear about it, but I got a bit confused taking it in, as it involved possibilities that had never occurred to me before. I remember another fragment - he told us that the slow, sluggish wasps we see at the end of summer that we call lazy and think - most of us, anyway - are that way because they've come to the end of their natural time and are dying out with the season, are in fact pregnant wasps, looking for somewhere to lie during the winter, a spot under a tile on the roof of my study, for instance. Come the spring they give birth to the worker wasps who will construct the nest in which they will dwell the summer long - at least until he comes along with his hose and canister and poisons their feet. He also said that one of the extraordinary things about the nests is that they always, every nest ever investigated, contain exactly 48 - I think it was 48 - anyway, always exactly the same number of chambers, maybe it was 49 because the central chamber was the queen's, and an even number of 48 chambers would encompass the royal chamber. And he said that the size of the royal chamber was in proportion to the size of the queen, so that every queen, large or small, had precisely the same amount of space at her disposal. He stood there, in the kitchen, drinking water, a hand on the counter sort of propping him, his feet crossed at the ankles, his eyes shiny with the pleasure of imparting information that we both wanted and didn't want - I think I can speak for Victoria here. She looked spellbound but stricken, making polite little sounds of distress because the fact was, and still is, that we had called in this pleasant, well-spoken and balding man to put an end to a complicated scheme of life. Had we the right? Now I think about it, I realise that he didn't describe the fate of the hornets and the bees. Would they have been approximately the same as that of the wasps?</p> <p>\"Now,\" he said, \"if you want to keep insects out of the kitchen\" - all sorts of them were all over the place as he spoke, masses of flies. Flies in kitchens are disgusting, there's no getting away from it. They defecate, urinate, salivate, vomit and probably masturbate over any bit of food they alight on, sometimes as you're raising it to your mouth. So yes, we said, we wanted to keep them out of the kitchen and out of my study, their two favourite places. He said that there were very good systems we should consider, but the one that he advocated, he had one himself at home and it worked perfectly and he went on to describe it - it seemed rather complicated and technological to me. I'm not sure that Victoria grasped it properly either, but we were so completely persuaded by him, he was so meticulous in his manner and so authoritative, that we agreed to have it, two of it, whatever it was, expensive though it was. He said he would arrange to have them delivered in a couple of days, accepted a cheque - included in the amount was a sum for his work on the nests - gathered his equipment and drove off in his van. I had an idea that he would be singing as he drove back through the country lanes, \"Bee-loud glades, loud-bee glades, here I come, here come I.\"</p> <p>The fly-killing contraptions were delivered this morning and are now in place, one on the windowsill by the fridge in the kitchen, the other on a bookshelf in my study. They look somewhat like birdcages, but instead of containing a bird they contain a circular tube, and behind the tube is a sheet of metal. A cable goes from a plug in a socket at the top of the cage to a plug in the wall. When you switch it on the tube turns a luminous blue and the metal sheet behind it is electrified. Insects of all types are attracted by the luminous blue light, fly to it between the bars of the cage, circle around it, settle on the sheet of metal behind it, and are promptly electrocuted. It's quite unsettling, really, because the electrocution makes a sharp, sizzling noise, as of a strip of bacon tossed into a hot frying pan, and is sometimes quite prolonged. So far we've been unable to watch the final moment, averting our eyes as we see a wasp, say, winging its way eagerly towards the cage, and keeping them averted until a little while after the sizzling's stopped, but the animals have been distinctly uneasy, the cats sitting with their backs to the cage, Toto lying curled under the table, growling, and George, the most sensitive of creatures, hurrying about the kitchen, darting in and out through the flap, making whimpering noises. We wondered, in fact, whether she could hear within the sizzling other sounds, screams for instance. Do insects scream? A question for a Moral Sciences paper: \"Do insects scream? Discuss.\"</p> <p>At the bottom of the cage is a tray on to which their corpses drop. When the tray is piled high you slip it out and shake the corpses into the rubbish bag in the kitchen, or cross the garden and shake them over the fence into the field. You can glance down before you do so and take note of the astonishing uniformity of the dead. Moths, mosquitoes, blowflies, wasps, hornets, bees, horseflies, greenfly, grasshoppers, ladybugs, butterflies, almost indistinguishable from each other, dried and frazzled as they are, like toast crumbs.</p> <p>It's 3.15am and I've just come back into my study from having a pee. A moth came in behind me, a very large moth, almost the size of a small bird, and with powerfully beating wings. It flapped and flapped around the lamp on my desk while I tried to usher it back out into the garden without touching it, because I have an idea that touching moths, or anyway their wings, kills them - so I waved my hands at it and blew at its arse, then fanned at it with a newspaper - it was pale grey, so pale that it was almost colourless, in fact it would have been ghost-like if it hadn't been in such a tumult, blundering around the light until I fanned it off course towards the door, it actually went out and then banged back in before I could shut the door, it just missed my face, sort of helicoptered over my head and when I turned around it was squeezing its large body through the rails of the electric cage - I got hold of the cage and tried to shake it out, but in fact succeeded in shaking it right into the cage, it went around the blue tube several times, and then it made for the electric plate, there was a small flash, more like a spark, and I turned my head away from the noise that went on and on and on - like Harold's poem of that title, and its content too, come to think of it - on and on and on and on -</p> <p>Now it's a few minutes later, and I'm sitting at my desk writing this, and as I write I realise that all I had to do to save the moth was to switch the cage off - instead of tipping and tilting the cage to shake it loose, just switch the bloody cage off - Well, I've done that now, I've switched it off, and tried not to see the husk, no longer grey but brown, lying on top of a heap of flies, wasps, other moths and so forth, so forth in the tray - I think I'll keep the cage switched off until I go to bed, and meanwhile let me remind myself that the natural lifespan of a moth is very short, possibly only a matter of hours, but then a matter of hours may be a long time if you're a moth - the equivalent for me of, say, 70 years come next October -</p> <p>I was watching Agassi beating a big chap called Pavel, who looked much older than Agassi - but almost everybody looks older than Agassi, who has the eyes and smile of a very sweet child, or one's best idea of a very sweet child, and is as bald as a baby, shaven bald, one assumes, not alopecia - anyway Pavel, heavily built and lumbering, but with a powerful backhand and marvellous powers of retrieval, is in fact a couple of years younger than Agassi, and was giving him a very hard game, but Agassi, swept along on waves of love from his New York fans, triumphed and blew kisses at us, bowed straight into the camera and blew kisses at me, personally it almost seemed, with McEnroe's voice, over, telling me how much I loved him.</p> <p>A moth blundered on to the screen, on to Agassi's mouth, then blundered off, towards the insect-killing machine, which I turned off just before it could get through the bars. I tried to usher it out through the door, but it vanished, probably behind the curtains. I left the door open so it could get out, and in came Errol. He went around my feet to the curtains, fished behind them, stuffed the moth in his mouth, then it was down his throat. Bits of the wings hung out. Then down they went.</p>"
