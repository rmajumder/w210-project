  "<p>Backed by hundreds of demonstrators, an anti-war veterans group began marching toward the Democratic convention hall today to press Barack Obama into supporting a quicker US withdrawal from Iraq.</p> <p>The protest, organised by Iraq Veterans Against the War (IVAW), was not approved by the city of Denver. Trucks of armed police in riot gear were dispatched to watch closely for any eruptions of violence.</p> <p>Garett Reppenhagen, a US army sniper who served in Kosovo and Iraq, said the march aimed to prod Obama and the Democrats into making good on their campaign-trail promises to end the war.</p> <p>\"He goes to Iraq to do PR stunts to build his credibility on the war, but he's afraid to come home and face anti-war veterans,\" Reppenhagen said. \"I'm not voting for hope. I want practical solutions.\"</p> <p>The IVAW march is slated to culminate at the Pepsi centre, the heavily guarded convention arena, but law enforcement is likely to halt the trek before it reaches downtown Denver. Reppenhagen said the police were \"working with us\" but could not say how far protesters would get.</p> <p>In a further complication for the marchers, many in the boisterous, sign-waving crowd came out more for Rage Against the Machine than rage against Obama's war policy. </p> <p>The popular rock band played a free concert that was timed to end just as the anti-war protest began, encouraging music fans to join in and confront the Democrats. Asked what inspired him to march, one 26-year-old demonstrator shrugged, \"I've got nothing to do today.\"</p> <p>Demonstrations at this week's convention have proven more low-key than early forecasts predicted, although police fired pepper spray into a crowd on Monday night before arresting 100 people for blocking the streets.</p> <p>\"Many [in the crowd] were observed carrying rocks and other items that could be used to threaten public safety,\" the city police said in a release on the arrests.</p> <p>Yesterday saw 18 more arrests, bringing the total for convention week to 135. The biggest controversy arose over videotape showing a Denver police officer pushing a young female anti-war protester, Alicia Forrest, to the ground with no apparent provocation. </p> <p>The officer later arrested Forrest when she began telling reporters about the confrontation. She was released from jail this morning.</p>",
  "<p>In August 1980 Ronald Reagan kickstarted his first run for the White House with a speech at the annual fair of Philadelphia, a small town in Mississippi. It was an odd choice of location for such a high-profile event, just days after he had accepted his party's nomination as presidential candidate. A community of a few thousand people, Philadelphia is well off the beaten track. But as he spoke in front of an enthusiastic and all-white crowd, his purpose became clearer. He famously posed on stage in a rocking chair, Nancy on his knee, her shoes caked in Mississippi mud. Then he started addressing the crowd.</p> <p>He was in favour of states' rights, he said, earning a lusty cheer. That sounds innocent enough as a political statement, but made in the deep south it had resonance. It was a euphemism, widely recognised at that time, for support of southern racial segregation and opposition to the meddling anti-racism of the federal government.</p> <p>It would have been a controversial statement anywhere in the south. But to make it in Philadelphia's fairground was more than that. A little more than a mile away from where Reagan spoke was the mound of earth where 16 years previously three young civil rights activists had been found buried, each one with a single shot through the heart. The men had been investigating an African-American church that had been burned to the ground by the Ku Klux Klan. Their murders, later immortalised in the Hollywood film Mississippi Burning, provoked nationwide revulsion and helped to secure the passage of Lyndon Johnson's civil rights act and with it the dismantling of southern segregation.</p> <p>Given the location, Reagan's clarion call for states' rights was a bold and deeply cynical move. As the liberal commentator Paul Krugman has put it: \"Everyone got the message.\"</p> <p>And the message stuck. It helped convert southern whites, the so-called Dixiecrats who had backed the Democratic party for decades, to defect to Reagan's cause, securing him victory in 1980 and completing the Republican stranglehold on the south that remains firm to this day. Mississippi has voted Republican in every presidential election since Reagan entered the White House. In 2004, John Kerry carried not a single southern state. </p> <p>But now something is in the air. In March the unthinkable came to Philadelphia, in the form of a politician who has dubbed himself \"a black man with a funny name\" and who won the Democratic primary in Mississippi by a landslide: Barack Obama.</p> <p>His victory in this quintessential corner of the deep south has brought back to the surface questions of race and allegiance that have to some degree been suppressed or reconciled over the years. For the 40% of the town's 7,000 residents who are black, it is evidence that change - so long in coming - is on its way. But it has put the white leadership of the local Republican party, as one party member told me, into a tailspin. \"The combination of Obama's liberal record, his middle name, Hussein, and his blackness - those three things are enough to put an elderly southern conservative into a state of shock.\"</p> <p>Tonight, on the 45th anniversary of Martin Luther King's famous \"I have a dream\" speech in front of the Lincoln Memorial, Obama will present America with his own dream speech. But as he does so, the racial divisions that he hopes to transcend remain unclear. How much has the country moved on from the dark days of segregation? Are towns like Philadelphia now free of their past? </p> <p>Despite the ugly symbolism of the town's history, today it looks outwardly transformed. The Confederate flag still flies in the central square as part of the Mississippi banner, but those other hallmarks of segregation - the separate drinking fountains, hospital waiting rooms, \"coloured\" sections at the back of the bus - are, of course, long gone. The schools are technically, if not practically, integrated; black businesses have opened up in the central square; even the local country club opened its doors to black members five years ago.</p> <p>Stan Dearman has observed the gradual sea-change with a semi-outsider's eye. He moved to the town in 1966, about 18 months after the murders, to take up editorship of the local paper, the Neshoba Democrat. \"I was hoping that most of the turmoil in this community was behind us, but it was just starting. It was like a cancer in the whole community. It wouldn't go away no matter how much people wanted it to.\"</p> <p>But over time, he's noticed the prevailing mood of the town grow less clannish, less insular. The conviction in January 2005 of Edgar Ray Killen, a local resident, on three counts of manslaughter - the first and only successful prosecution of a perpetrator of the 1964 killings - was a huge step forward in Dearman's view, though he says six or seven men are still out there \"who need to be brought before the bar of justice\".</p> <p>But it is striking that though Dearman thinks change has come to Mississippi, he doesn't think it will translate into an Obama victory, not in Philadelphia, at least. \"There's still a racial edge. People still see things in black and white - it's deeply ingrained. The mindset is: whites vote Republican, blacks Democrat.\"</p> <p>It is a sign of how the tectonic plates of race in the south are shifting that while Dearman, who is white, is sceptical about the extent of political movement, many of the black residents of Philadelphia are fired up, to use an Obamaism. James Young, 53, was of the generation put through state-enforced integration of schools, and bears the emotional scars to prove it. He remembers white kids hurling the N-word at him. He also recalls lying on the floor of his living room, his father with a gun in his hand, when the Klan were, in his words, \"on the move\".</p> <p>For years the black side of the tracks in Philadelphia, where he still lives, had a cloud over it that was part apathy, part despondency. \"If a black man stood for president you would just say, 'No way, no way'.\" Now, as a pastor in the local black church, he is exhorting the congregation to get out and register to vote.</p> <p>\"The generation that wouldn't contemplate a black president is passing on, and that's good for everybody. If it's not now, it's just around the corner. We will no longer be denied,\" he says. </p> <p>How important is that for African Americans in the south? </p> <p>\"It's a feeling you can't put into words. It's like we are no longer a subculture. Finally it's given us reason to think we are part of the overall scheme of things.\"</p> <p>That newfound optimism is reflected in voting trends in Mississippi. Until this year, the average turnout for a Democratic primary there would be about 90,000. In March it was 500,000, three-quarters of whom were black. In 2004, George Bush took the state with 670,000 votes to his name - suggesting that a huge turnout of black voters in November would give Obama a big bounce in Mississippi, a state with the highest proportion of African-Americans in the US (39%). That would certainly scare the Republican elders even more than they are already.</p> <p>But, of course, that still leaves the balance of power in the hands of the majority white voters. As Professor Marty Wiseman of Mississippi State University explains, race is no longer the number one issue for most white voters, but it remains an issue. \"Any Democratic candidate who gets a big turnout of black voters is off to a very good start. It's just getting that other 20% that's difficult.\"</p> <p>Philadelphia has changed; its ugly old ways are being shed. But this is evolution, not revolution, and some of the racial canker remains. Several people tell me that interracial relationships are no longer taboo. And then I meet Taneil Long. She is sitting in her nail salon in the central square, serving a black customer, the smell of varnish heavy in the air. In 2002, after she split up with the white father of her two daughters, she started dating a black man.</p> <p>\"I honestly thought this would be different - I mean, we're not in the 60s any more. But it really became a big issue for me,\" she says. </p> <p>The first thing she noticed was that her white clientele thinned out, to be replaced by a customer base largely comprising black women. Then her landlady turned on her, saying there had been complaints in her white neighbourhood about her boyfriend. \"I asked her was there a problem with the fact that he was black. She told me I had to get out.\" The father of her children recently told the girls he will never allow them to go out with black men.</p> <p>Long is herself mixed-race - part white, part Vienamese (her white father served in the Vietnam war), giving her a natural affinity to the mixed race Obama. And yet she is uncertain about him. \"You don't want a president with no connection to Christianity,\" she says.</p> <p>But he is a Christian, I reply, to her surprise.</p> <p>\"Really? I'd heard he was a Muslim.\"</p> <p>I'd been warned about this. Young had told me that in his pastoral work he found the Muslim question frequently popping up. But even so, it was a shock to find the false rumour, spread maliciously by Republican-leaning websites and gossipmongers, circulating so freely.</p> <p>It comes up in my chat with Steve Wilkerson, the affable white owner of a clothing shop, Steve's, on the square. He has worked hard for the past few years, together with black residents such as Young, to heal Philadelphia's troubled race relations. Wilkerson says he has received emails with such titles as \"Obama: the real story\", dwelling scurrilously on his supposed Muslim faith. He says there is much apprehension abroad. \"When you drive through white neighbourhoods I don't think you'll see many Obama signs or bumper stickers. People who vote for him will do it quietly. They don't know who he is, what his religion is. Is he the antichrist?\"</p> <p>Wilkerson himself is clearly conflicted. He knows Obama calls himself a Christian and says \"that's good enough for me. I'm not a judge.\" But later in our conversation he admits that he too is troubled. \"I'd like reassurance about who he is, who's backing him, just to be sure there's not an underlying current.\"</p> <p>What is his worst fear?</p> <p>\"That he does turn out to be a Muslim after all.\"</p> <p>And it comes up forcefully when I step in to Wilson's barber shop. Wilson is sitting looking slightly forlorn in the empty premises, clippings of hair scattered on the floor around his feet. \"I don't have anything against a black man as president,\" he begins. \"But Obama, he's not qualified. When you are president you represent everyone, not just your race. I've heard him talk about 'his people'.\"</p> <p>He goes on: \"And what about his religion, he can't just drop his religion.\" </p> <p>What do you mean, I ask. </p> <p>\"He's a Muslim.\"</p> <p>No, he's not. He's a Christian.</p> <p>\"Well, he should make it clear he stands by Christian values in America. That he doesn't hold those other values.\"</p> <p>But he has made that clear.</p> <p>\"I don't think he's done that at all. He's just run from it. He should have nipped it in the bud and made clear he's a president for everybody.\"</p> <p>But he's said that. What else can he do?</p> <p>\"Just because he's a Muslim, he should make it clear he doesn't believe in suicide bombing and killing.\"</p> <p>The prevalence in my admittedly unscientific survey of downtown Philadelphia of the Obama = Muslim myth helps explain the ongoing furore over race preoccupying the two presidential campaigns. Obama first sounded the alarm in June, saying he was preparing himself for underhand Republican tactics that would try to spread jitters among voters. \"They're going to try and make you afraid of me. He's young and inexperienced and he's got a funny name. And did I mention he's black?\"</p> <p>That comment sank without trace, but when Obama repeated last month that the Republicans were trying to play up the fact that \"he doesn't look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills\", the McCain camp grabbed the ball and ran with it. A McCain aide accused Obama of playing the race card, from the bottom of the deck.</p> <p>Despite McCain's protestations that he is fighting an honest and race-blind campaign, Obama has good reason to be wary about the negative hits that are now coming at him from the rival camp. He knows all too well that the Swiftboat attacks that floored John Kerry, by calling into question his wartime record in Vietnam, were made by outrider groups that kept themselves scrupulously clean of Bush's fingerprints. There has been a creeping drift towards racial innuendo within McCain's increasingly venomous campaign. Attack ads run over the summer have shown Obama playing basketball - an overwhelmingly black sport in the US - and placed him in juxtaposition with Britney Spears and Paris Hilton in what some commentators have interpreted as a play on that old taboo on black men associating with sexualised white women. In one of his earliest ads, McCain referred to himself pointedly as \"the American president Americans have been waiting for\". That is an uncanny echo of the secret advice we now know was given to Hillary Clinton by her former chief strategist, Mark Penn, during the primary contest. In leaked memos, he urged her to portray Obama as someone whose \"roots to basic American values and culture are at best limited\".</p> <p>The Obama campaign is fighting back against this insidious and underhand play on his race by stressing all this week that his is a \"very American story\" - neatly turning on its head the message of his assailants. But that device is in part a recognition on his part that there is a problem. </p> <p>As the Democratic convention opened in Denver, opinion polls suggested that the clear lead he had held over McCain nationally for several weeks had all but slipped away, creating a palpable anxiety among Democratic supporters. They know that by August in their respective presidential election years - 1988 and 2004 - Michael Dukakis was 17 points ahead of George Bush Sr and John Kerry was four points ahead of George Bush Jr. And we know what happened to them.</p> <p>A growing chorus can be heard among pundits and pontificators. Is Obama's inability to pull away decisively from McCain, even though everything seems to be going in his favour, something to do with race? As John Heilemann, New York magazine's sharp political observer, has said: \"Call me crazy, but isn't it possible, just possible, that Obama's lead is being inhibited by the fact that he is, you know, black?\" </p> <p>Certainly, a closer look at the polls uncovers a stubbornly consistent racial divide. A recent Gallup poll had 91% of black voters backing Obama - indicating a nationwide trend in tune with Mississippi. Hispanics were keen on him too, with 68%. But non-Hispanic whites showed a clear preference for McCain, at 49% to Obama's 39%. When you factor in gender, the disparity is yet more glaring. White women came out evenly divided between the two candidates, but look at the findings for white men: McCain 55%, Obama 34%.</p> <p>That may not matter so much in the south, where white voters have - ever since Reagan's Philadelphia speech - tended to vote sheeplike for the Republicans anyway. But it could matter a lot in several northern states such as Ohio, Michigan or Pennsylvania where the contest is likely to be tight and where there is a preponderance of white working-class voters struggling in the economically stricken rust belt.</p> <p>That's the thing about many discussions of race in the US - they so easily overlook the north. The assumption is that the south was where the problem started with slavery and the civil war, while the north has always been a haven of enlightenment.</p> <p>But it is the north that today hosts the most segregated cities in the US. The most recent census in 2000 shows that nine out of the 10 most segregated cities are northern, including New York, Chicago, and Cleveland and Cincinnati in the crucial electoral battleground of Ohio. \"The northern system of segregation has never been about symbols of power on the streets - separate water fountains - but about segregated neighbourhoods and workplaces,\" says Kevin Boyle, a specialist in race and culture at Ohio State University. He reminds us that Obama struggled to gain support among white working-class communities in several northern states in the primary fight against Hillary Clinton, where issues of race and class are interwoven. In Ohio, almost one in five Democratic voters told exit pollsters that race had loomed large in their decision (Clinton won by 54% to 44%). \"States like Ohio are so close that just a couple of percent of voters who decide not to vote for him on grounds of race could swing the result,\" Boyle says.</p> <p>To see how the race factor is playing in these areas I fly 800 miles north from Philadelphia, to Livonia in Michigan. It was listed in the 2000 census as the whitest town in America. About 95% of its 100,000 residents are white and less than 1% black. The neighbouring town, Detroit, is more than 80% black - and the region as a whole sits at the top of the nation's segregation league table.</p> <p>So how do the residents of America's whitest town feel about a possible Obama presidency? Could they see him winning? \"I don't think he has a snowball's chance,\" says Glenn, sitting out on his front porch in one of Livonia's more affluent areas, reading the local paper. \"Not just because he's black - though that's a very good start - but because he has no experience.\"</p> <p>Livonia has acquired a reputation for racial tetchiness over the years. Plans to build two big shopping malls led to protests from some residents who feared they would attract \"Detroiters\" - a reference to the residents of Livonia's predominately black neighbour. A recent case, successfully prosecuted by federal authorities, fined a Livonia landlord more than $700,000 for refusing to rent apartments to black families. \"If blacks come in here, we really don't have anything available for them,\" the landlord told his employees, a clue perhaps to how Livonia has managed to stay so white over the years.</p> <p>A few doors down from Glenn, Eric is the only black resident in this part of town. He appears the perfect neighbour. His lawn is neatly trimmed, the brass on his gas lamp polished to mirror quality. About the only quibble one might have is that he has allowed his hostas to be nibbled by slugs.</p> <p>That hasn't stopped the grumbling. A couple of neighbours bluntly refuse to acknowledge him when passing on the street. One resident asked him if he were running a childcare scheme when some of his children's cousins stayed over. Another called the town authorities to complain he had a service vehicle in his drive, when other neighbours had much bigger trucks in theirs. He shrugs off these vexations: \"They don't hurt me or my family.\" As for Obama's chances, he says, \"Some people wonder what I'm doing here, let alone a black president of the United States.\"</p> <p>About a mile away from Eric's home is the blue-collar area of Roseland. It has the same detached houses and neatly trimmed lawns, except everything is scaled down. That's how it is in America: class as defined not by accent or breeding, but by square feet of real estate. It is in streets such as these that the economic downturn is really biting - rising food and petrol prices, job lay-offs, housing foreclosures. Jack, watering his plants in the front garden, says the hardship has to some extent led to a feeling of togetherness locally, even with his few black neighbours. But he goes on to say: \"A black president - that's a tough sell. Obama could be all right now, but come November people might say, 'Not yet'.\"</p> <p>And so to my final knock on a door. It is answered by Margaret, a grandmother who has a big sign in her window saying, \"Beware the Dog\", and a Stars and Stripes flying above the lintel. She grew up in Detroit but moved to Livonia as part of the white flight from the city in the 60s. She is proud of her Scottish parentage, and of her solid Democratic roots, but she is swift to tell me that Obama is not experienced enough for the White House. Not experienced enough. The phrase is starting to sound as widely used in Livonia as Muslim was in Philadelphia. Then she says: \"There's a lot of people who don't want a black man in the White House.\"</p> <p>It occurs to me that of all the people I have spoken to - both in Livonia and in Philadelphia, towns separated by 800 miles and a divergent history - it has always been the \"other people\" who won't vote for Obama. Not a single person has said they personally would balk at a black president.</p> <p>When she says there are a lot of people who don't want a black man in 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, does that include her?</p> <p>Pause.</p> <p>\"Not really.\"</p> <p>Does \"not really\" mean yes or no?</p> <p>\"I wouldn't want to see it in my lifetime.\"</p> <p>A black presidency?</p> <p>\"I wouldn't like to see it, OK?\"</p> <p>She gives me a look of cold steel that announces the conversation is over.</p> <p>Margaret's rare blast of honesty provides closure of a sort to this journey around race and the presidential campain. But it would be wrong to leave it on such a note. At the age of 81, she is, after all, a product of the past more than an indication of the future. Despite Obama's narrow lead, he has crucial advantages over his opponent. He is hugely more charismatic and inspiring than McCain and he has energised his following in a way that the Republicans can only dream about. He also benefits from a historically unpopular Bush presidency and a tanking economy. If an Obama victory is by no means certain, it is a very healthy possibility.</p> <p>Let's return to Dearman, former editor of Philadelphia's local paper, who has lived through some of the country's most shameful moments, including Ronald Reagan's fairground speech, to see happier times. I ask him what he thinks the sight of Obama's two daughters, Malia and Sasha, playing on the White House lawn, would mean for America. \"It will be a big, big thing,\" he says. \"It would say that we, as a country, have arrived. There's a need for redemption, there always will be. An Obama presidency will provide some of that redemption.\"</p>",
  "<p>He was Delhi's most wanted - an urban outlaw like a character from a Bollywood film, with dreams in his eyes and a gun in his hand. But the law caught up with 30-year-old Om Prakash, alias Bunty, this week when police shot dead the man who aspired to be India's most feared gangster.</p> <p>For the past few months Bunty has been blamed for a one-man crimewave - shooting, stabbing and robbing his way into the news. Police say he had a hand in 41 murders, 19 of which were carried out since April when he gunned down three men within the space of a few hours.</p> <p>Tagged by the authorities as a \"BC\", which stands for Bad Character, the worst kind of criminal, Bunty's speciality was to roar up to victims on flashy motorcycles, demand money and shoot dead anyone who refused. An ambitious, skinny man he revelled in the media spotlight - at his hideouts were newspaper cuttings of his criminal escapades.</p> <p>Police held him almost solely responsible for a recent spate of violence, which led to accusations of a breakdown of law and order in India's capital, a city where many people are making lots of money coveted by criminal gangs.</p> <p>The would-be kingpin was meticulous about evading capture. He slept little, never carried a mobile phone and wrote his contact numbers in codes. To avoid being stopped by police, Bunty dressed smartly and carried his weapons in a laptop bag so that he blended into the crowds of motorcycle-driving office workers.</p> <p>Careful to the point of being paranoid, few knew where he would stay at night. One of his gang members said that he was so scared of losing his money that he slept on pillows stuffed with cash.</p> <p>Bunty wanted to be a \"don\", one of the select few Indian gangsters who live a glamorous life in Dubai beyond the reach of law. To make sure he could start intimidating a better class of victim, he began learning English. When he was shot dead, Bunty was found with a bag containing a student's guide to learning English, a dictionary and a notebook where his first sentence was \"Do you study English? Yes I do.\"</p> <p>There is little doubt among police that Bunty was influenced by the glorification of violence and thuggery by Bollywood. Bunty's desire to speak English was straight out of a scene from a recent blockbuster, Tashaan, where a gangster made a point of speaking like a BBC presenter from the 1960s.</p> <p>Ruthless with a penchant for extreme violence, Bunty had also inspired others - including a student at Delhi University - to mimic his life of crime.</p> <p>In many ways, Bunty's ambitions are a reflection of the simmering desire to get ahead in India. He began life as a fairly unsuccessful small-time pickpocket in his teens before ending up in prison. </p> <p>Released in 2005, he became a police informer - learning the tricks of the trade from the very men who would one day hunt him down.</p>",
  "<p>A mysterious, itchy rash appears on your skin. Where do you head for an explanation? In an age of instant gratification the answer is increasingly likely to be your computer keyboard, where you can find an instant (if unreliable) diagnosis and get a treatment delivered straight to your door. More than two million people in the UK are now thought to buy medications on the web; but in doing so, say experts, many are risking their health rather than finding a means to improve it.</p> <p>Yesterday it was reported that researchers at Boston University school of medicine have found that one fifth of the Indian herbal medicines available online contain potentially toxic heavy metals, including lead, mercury and arsenic. Dr Robert Saper and his team found 25 websites through an internet search engine and randomly selected and purchased 193 products made by 37 different manufacturers. They then subjected them to laboratory analysis. </p> <p>Their results, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, showed that medicines used in a branch of ayurveda called rasa shastra, used to treat serious illnesses, including paralysis, contained the highest levels of toxic metals, and that 20.7% of all products tested exceeded \"one or more standards for acceptable daily metal intake\".</p> <p>This is not the first time that ayurvedic medicine has come under scrutiny. Previous investigations have uncovered high levels of heavy metals in the remedies used in this ancient medical system, an approach that has been popularised in the west in recent years by the backing of celebrity fans including Madonna and Naomi Campbell. Worldwide, around 80 cases of lead poisoning have been reported in association with ayurvedic approaches, with some preparations containing the stimulant ephedrine, a substance linked to high blood pressure - and even to potentially fatal heart attacks and strokes in susceptible people. </p> <p>In some ways the risks have always been there. What has changed so dramatically is the ease with which consumers can now obtain these dangerously toxic concoctions for their bathroom cabinets from bogus online suppliers. In 2006, a report by Envision, a web analysis company, suggested that there were around 2,500 websites selling medicines - prescription and alternative - to consumers worldwide. Since then that figure is thought to have risen. And many of those who purchase herbal medicines online do so without really knowing whether they are legitimate, effective or safe. </p> <p>Like ayurveda, traditional Chinese medicine (or TCM), has become popular among those who want to try an alternative to Western medicine and prescription drugs. It has more than 1,000 clinics and 3,000 practitioners in the UK but is also a burgeoning online business. Through TCM's 3,000-year old healing system, ailments are corrected using a combination of herbal remedies that include a bewildering list of ingredients - more than 6,000 medicinal substances are used, 300 of them regularly. Proponents justify the safety of TCM by pointing to the 8,000 clinical studies that have confirmed it presents little risk. But critics argue that many of these investigations are not conducted to sufficiently rigorous standards and that some of the herbs, which are used in hundreds of different combinations, are known to be poisonous. </p> <p>Random tests by the Committee on Safety of Medicines have identified banned substances such as the herb aristolochia, (which is linked to kidney failure), steroids, arsenic and mercury in many TCM preparations. In the wrong hands, these elements could be lethal, yet they are widely distributed in products available on the internet. According to the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), a government authority that oversees the licensing and supply of medicines in the UK, products found to be on sale in recent years include a TCM slimming preparation that contained a highly toxic derivative of a banned substance called fenluramine, which is poisonous to the liver and a cause of heart irregularities in some people. Another product they found on the shelves was a Chinese treatment for constipation, called fufang luhui jiaonang, which contains 13% mercury - 117,000 times more than is legal in UK foodstuffs.</p> <p>Weeding out unscrupulous websites and suppliers is not easy, although efforts are being made to regulate UK suppliers of online medications. In February 2008, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain (RPSGB) launched an \"internet pharmacy logo\" designed to protect the public. Only credible UK e-pharmacies can carry the RPSGB logo which Priya Sejpal, head of professional ethics for the RPSGB, says is one step towards eliminating the use of risky sites. \"Consumers just simply couldn't tell a good distributor from a bad one,\" says Sejpal. \"A vast amount of products is available, but those sold from sites that offer to sell directly to the public or that offer unacceptable means of diagnosis do not meet our standards.\"</p> <p>In a bid to crackdown on dangerous medication, the MHRA holds regular Internet Days of Action, the latest of which was in February. On these days, enforcement officers either visit the premises of UK websites to arrest those <br>selling medications illegally, or contact the internet service providers of offending websites to ensure they are closed down. More than 40 websites are currently under investigation. \"We will not hesitate to take action against those who undermine public health,\" says Mick Deats, group manager of enforcement at the MHRA. But overseas suppliers are impossible to subject to any level of control. Often it is difficult to determine whether a site is UK-based or not - even websites ending in co.uk or org.uk can be based abroad. A survey of internet medicine suppliers by the Trading Standards Institute found that many of those based in places as far-flung as Canada, India and Peru were distributing powerful medications with no advice about dosage or associated risks. </p> <p>In 2006, two consultant opthalmologists from Sunderland Eye Infirmary reported the risks of self-prescription in the Lancet medical journal, highlighting the case of a patient who went blind after using an obscure Thai medication she had bought online. Dr Philip Severn and Dr Scott Fraser explained how the woman had used information on the internet to self-diagnose chronic fatigue syndrome and then, on the recommendation of a neighbour, purchased a product from Thailand that contained steroids. She took the tablets for four years before arriving at Sunderland Eye infirmary, <br>complaining of loss of vision. Severn and Fraser discovered she had cataracts in both eyes and signs of glaucoma - both of which are indicative of long-term steroid use - which will require treatment for the rest of her life. Buying online treatments for any medical condition \"is a gamble\", Fraser noted.</p> <p>Herbal products aren't just being bought and used to treat medical ailments. Dr Martin Schmidt, a specialist registrar in psychiatry at St George's Hospital in London, recently conducted a study into the rapid growth of what he calls the \"worrying availability\" of \"herbal highs\" - alternatives to recreational drugs - sold on the internet. </p> <p>There is a commonly held belief, says Schmidt, that if something is labelled as \"natural\" it is safe, \"but that is a dangerous assumption,\" he says. His findings, reported to the Royal College of Psychiatrists at their annual meeting, revealed that pills made from a cocktail of shamanic plants, synthetic stimulants and psychedelic cacti, were being sold as \"legal highs\" with unknown and potentially dangerous side effects. </p> <p>\"One product we found, called Original Herbal Ecstasy, contained nutmeg - which is hallucinogenic in sufficient quantities - hallucinogenic mushrooms and a lot of stimulants,\" he says. \"Yet there is no way of telling how much of these substances is in there. Most packets contain no information about side effects or the potential of mixing these substances with things such as alcohol or other medications. They could cause a range of psychiatric disturbances from anxiety to panic attacks to psychosis.\"</p> <p>In the course of his research, Schmidt stumbled across innocuous-looking herbal preparations intended for a range of uses, which contained ingredients as dangerous as fly agaric mushrooms (commonly regarded as poisonous), the San Pedro cacti (containing mescaline, a hallucinogenic drug) and salvia, a Mexican herb that has been linked to problems with motor coordination and balance with short-term use and, after long-term consumption, to schizophrenia. </p> <p>\"There is considerable risk to the public from obtaining medicines through unregulated websites,\" says Mick Deats of the MHRA. \"There is no guarantee of safety, quality or effectiveness. It could be counterfeit or out of date. It may not contain the right amount of medicine. There is no ongoing treatment monitoring. At worst it may cause severe side effects. It's not worth it.\"</p>",
  "<p>As far as space monsters go it is less menacing than Daleks or Klingons, but an unwanted intruder has made its way aboard the international space station. </p> <p>Gammima.AG, a malicious password-swiping computer virus, has broken new frontiers, by infecting two laptops on the ISS orbiting 215 miles above Earth.</p> <p>The virus was first detected on Earth in August 2007 infecting machines to steal login names for popular online games.</p> <p>Nasa officials have begun an investigation into how the virus made it aboard the ISS, but it is thought it might have been inadvertently carried into space on an astronaut's USB drive.</p> <p>Reports suggested that once on board the station, the memory device was plugged into the computers, infecting them both.</p> <p>Computers on the ISS are not directly connected to the internet but they have access to a satellite data link.

  "<p>Britain yesterday raised the stakes in the scramble to contain Russia, pledging support for Moscow's regional rival, Ukraine, and calling on the international community to stand up to Russia's campaign to redraw the map of Europe and make it pay a higher price for its actions in Georgia.</p> <p>David Miliband, the foreign secretary tipped as a future Labour party leader and potential prime minister, went to the Ukrainian capital, Kiev, to deliver a speech aimed at flying the flag of western democracy on Russia's doorstep, while seeking to avert a new crisis boiling over on the Crimean peninsula, home to an ethnic Russian population and Moscow's Black Sea fleet.</p> <p>The speech represented the strongest criticism of the Kremlin from a leading European government official in years, delivered in a country that is Russia's neighbour and which Russians view as the cradle of their civilisation.</p> <p>Miliband declared a turning point had been reached in Europe's relations with Russia, ending a nearly two decade period of relative tranquility. He said Tuesday's decision by the Russian president, Dmitry Medvedev, to recognise Georgia's breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia represented a radical break and a moment of truth for the rest of Europe.</p> <p>\"[Medvedev's] unilateral attempt to redraw the map marks a moment of real significance,\" the foreign secretary said. \"It is not just the end of the post cold war period of growing geopolitical calm in and around Europe. It is also the moment when countries are required to set out where they stand on the significant issues of nationhood and international law.\"</p> <p>\"The Georgia crisis has provided a rude awakening,\" the foreign secretary said. He responded to Medvedev's boast that he was not scared of a new cold war, saying: \"We don't want a new cold war. He has a big responsibility not to start one.</p> <p>Miliband arrived in Kiev at a time when Ukrainian officials are jittery over concerns that Russia could orchestrate a conflict over its Black Sea fleet, which is based in the Crimean port of Sevastopol, under a lease agreement with Ukraine.</p> <p>Ukrainian officials say Russia has been distributing passports to ethnic Russians living in Crimea, as it did in South Ossetia, and fear that a row over the use of the base may be employed to stir up separatist sentiment as a precursor to calling for a referendum on seceding from Ukraine. Viktor Yushchenko, the Ukrainian president, has riled Moscow by suggesting that Russia should pay a higher rent for Sevastopol and could be subject to more stringent conditions on its use. Miliband urged the Ukrainian government to \"stick to the letter\" of the lease agreement.</p> <p>In bilateral meetings yesterday, Ukrainians pressed for British support in their bid to begin membership proceedings for both the EU and Nato. They are looking for positive signals from an EU-Ukraine meeting next month, and hope to be offered a membership action plan at a Nato ministerial meeting in December. Miliband signalled that Kiev had Britain's backing.</p> <p>\"My visit is designed to send a simple message: we have not forgotten our commitments to you,\" he told Ukrainians, asserting that the relationship between Moscow and Kiev could not be that of \"master and servant\".</p> <p>In the harshest criticism of Russian conduct since the Caucasus crisis erupted three weeks ago, he accused the Kremlin of shredding the rulebook governing international relations and of \"torpedoing\" the work of the UN security council.</p> <p>\"Over Georgia, Russia has moved from support for territorial integrity to breaking up the country in three weeks, and relied entirely on military force to do so. In between, it signed a ceasefire agreement which included international mediation as the way forward. If her word is not her bond then she will not be trusted by anyone ... Russia needs to ask itself about the relationship between short-term military victories and longer term economic prosperity.\" Miliband said the west must now \"raise the costs to Russia of disregarding its responsibilities\". In particular, Europe should hit back on the oil and gas market, with measures aimed at loosening Russia's powers as a monopoly seller.</p> <p>\"Europe needs to act as one when dealing with third parties like Russia,\" he said. To do that, the EU should invest in gas storage facilities, build up an internal market and negotiate as a single entity, rather than cutting separate deals.</p> <p>Russia, Miliband said, \"must not learn the wrong lessons from the Georgia crisis: there can be no going back on fundamental principles of territorial integrity, democratic governance and international law.\"</p> <p>But the foreign secretary argued against isolating Russia. \"Russia is too enmeshed in the world economy. It would be counterproductive,\" he said. The approach should be one of \"hard-headed engagement\". For example he opposed Russia's expulsion from the G8 group of industrialised countries, but instead called for the G7 (the group minus Russia) to hold discussions when necessary without Russia.</p> <p>Last night G7 foreign ministers issued a joint statement condemning Russia's recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and deplored Moscow's \"excessive use of military force in Georgia and its continued occupation of parts of Georgia\".</p> <p>While Miliband delivered his broadside in Kiev, his French counterpart, Bernard Kouchner, warned that Ukraine and Moldova, which also has a pro-Russian breakaway region, Transnistria, could become the next targets of a newly assertive Russia.</p> <p>Yushchenko, who met Miliband yesterday, said Russian actions in Georgia were unacceptable. \"What has happened is a threat to everyone, not just for one country. Any nation could be next. When we allow someone to ignore the fundamental right of territorial integrity, we put into doubt the existence of any country.\"</p>",
  "<p>US and Russian warships on opposing sides of the Georgia conflict took up positions in the Black Sea yesterday in a war of nerves.</p> <p>With the Russians effectively controlling Georgia's main naval base at Poti, Moscow also dispatched the missile cruiser Moskva and two smaller craft on \"peacekeeping\" duties at the port of Sukhumi on the coast of Abkhazia, the breakaway region that the Kremlin recognised as independent on Tuesday.</p> <p>The US, wary of escalating a fraught situation, cancelled the scheduled docking in Poti of the US coastguard vessel Dallas and instead sent it to the southern Georgian-controlled port of Batumi to deliver relief supplies.</p> <p>\"Let's hope we don't see any direct confrontation,\" said Dmitri Peskov, spokesman for the Russian prime minister, Vladimir Putin, as Moscow challenged the US policy of using military aircraft and ships to deliver aid.</p> <p>\"The decision to deliver aid using Nato battleships is something that hardly can be explained,\" said Peskov. \"It's not a common practice.\"</p> <p>He added that Russian naval forces were taking \"some measures of precaution\" around the Black Sea as the dispute caused by Russia's recognition of Abkhazia's and South Ossetia's independence resulted in strong criticism from the European countries most reluctant to sever relations with Russia.</p> <p>Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, spoke to Dmitri Medvedev, Russia's president, yesterday, the first western leader to talk to the Kremlin since he recognised the two secessionist regions of Georgia, and made it plain she had voiced her strong disapproval.</p> <p>\"I made clear above all that I would have expected that we would talk about these questions in [international] organisations before unilateral recognition happened,\" she said. \"There are several UN security council resolutions in which the territorial integrity of Georgia was stressed, which Russia also worked on.\"</p> <p>Bernard Kouchner, the French foreign minister, said Russia had broken international law and, along with other senior European officials, was worried that Russia's decision to redraw Georgia's borders would encourage Moscow to act similarly with other parts of the former Soviet Union. \"We cannot accept these violations of international law ... of a territory by the army of a neighbouring country,\" he said.</p> <p>Germany and France, both of whom opposed the US and Britain in April by blocking Georgian negotiations to join Nato, have been the most reluctant to punish Russia for the conflict of the past three weeks and are desperate to try to revive the Russia-Georgia peace plan mediated by President Nicolas Sarkozy of France a fortnight ago.</p> <p>Both Paris and Berlin agreed that the unilateral recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia by Russia left the peace plan ineffectual. A summit of EU leaders in Brussels on Monday will discuss Europe's options. </p> <p>With mounting warnings of western economic or trade sanctions against Russia, a EU official said that threats to block Russian membership of the World Trade Organisation were meaningless. The push for Russian admission to the WTO was being driven not by Moscow but by western business interests keen to tap the large Russian market, he said.</p> <p>Peskov also warned that trade sanctions against Moscow would hurt the west as much as Russia. He admitted that South Ossetia, a mountainous region of 70,000 people, would struggle to establish itself as an independent state, but emphasised that Russia's constitution made it possible for Russia to expand.</p> <p>\"My country will extend the arm of cooperation and friendship to ease the transition period [for South Ossetia],\" he said.</p> <p>EU officials also complained that Moscow was seeking to control the distribution of international relief. EU aid officials were demanding entry to the Russian controlled regions, but were being barred unless they handed over the aid to the Russian authorities for distribution.</p>",
  "<p>You won't find too many people grumbling about the oil price's lurches in the sleepy prairie town of Cushing. Things are looking up for the rural community where Wall Street's energy gambles are translated into reality.</p> <p>A modest settlement of 8,300 people, the Oklahoma town is home to a shabby collection of junk stores, a medium-security prison and a handful of barbecue restaurants. But these buildings are dwarfed by hundreds of vast steel storage tanks holding 46m barrels of oil - worth, at current prices, more than $5.5bn.</p> <p>An oil-themed sculpture on the country road into Cushing proclaims that the place is the \"pipeline crossroads of the world\". A spaghetti junction in the continent's network of underground oil pipes, Cushing is the official delivery point for any oil bought on Wall Street's Nymex commodities exchange.</p> <p>\"While a lot of towns have suffered some economic setbacks recently, we have not,\" Cushing's mayor, John Henckel, told the Guardian. </p> <p><strong>Junction city</strong></p> <p>An hour's drive east of Oklahoma City, the town is a point at which oil pipes from the Gulf of Mexico's ports meet lines to refineries across northern, eastern and western US, coinciding with pipelines bringing crude south from Canada's oil sands.</p> <p>\"We didn't become the crossroads of the oil industry by any great design,\" says Henckel. \"It wasn't that a bunch of guys got together and said they were going to build an oil system and put Cushing at the centre. It just evolved.\"</p> <p>When investors buy or sell oil contracts on the Nymex trading floor in New York, they are dealing in the right to collect barrels of oil at depots in Cushing. Laboratories here check the purity and metal content of crude to ensure it meets various grades such as west Texas intermediate, Oklahoma sweet or western Canadian select. Some customers ask for different crudes to be blended to a particular recipe.</p> <p>If speculators hang on to oil in the hope of a price rise, or if airlines choose to hedge against surging fuel costs, they often do so by storing oil in Cushing.</p> <p>BP has about 65 tanks in Cushing holding 10m barrels' worth of customers' oil. The British company's reputation was sullied two years ago when regulators accused it of using data from its Cushing pipelines and tanks to manipulate the price of crude oil. </p> <p>But the biggest player locally is Enbridge, a Canadian firm, which has 93 tanks including vast 575,000-barrel drums that each hold more than a small ocean-going oil tanker. New tanks are rapidly going up in the fields on Cushing's outskirts.</p> <p>\"We're responding to our customers' demand for storage,\" says Bruce MacPhail, Enbridge's director of contract terminals. He cites \"more hedging, more use of contracts for risk mitigation and financial players using the market to speculate and make money\".</p> <p>Since the beginning of the decade, the amount of oil stored in Cushing has jumped by more than 50%. In the past four years, the value of the stuff has rocketed as the price of crude has tripled.</p> <p><strong>Mind-boggling</strong></p> <p>\"Oil is the lifeblood of Cushing,\" says Jim Perry, managing editor of the weekly Cushing Citizen. \"The storage capacity is large. Even more mind-boggling is the flow of oil in pipelines through Cushing.\"</p> <p>Such a lot of oil can cause hazards. Residents are urged to call a freephone number run collectively by the oil companies before doing any excavation in their gardens, to check whether any pipelines lie beneath. At least twice a week, engineers in light planes fly over the path of every major line to keep an eye out for construction or any activity that might burst a pipe.</p> <p>\"They say if you took a claw and turned up the ground here, it would look like a bowl of pasta,\" says Roy Maye, a safety officer at Enbridge. </p> <p>When oil prices peaked in July at $147 a barrel, Cushing's economic development director, Robert Felts, was getting cold calls from speculators fishing for information about the volume being stored by investors. \"Even if I knew, I wouldn't have told them,\" he said.</p> <p>Record prices have led to a flourishing scene in small-scale entrepreneurial drilling. Cushing sits on top of an old oilfield that was a major source of production in the early part of the last century but has been abandoned as uneconomical.</p> <p>With Tropical Storm Gustav causing alarm in the Gulf of Mexico and prices now pushing $120 a barrel, long forgotten marginal wells in backyards and farmers' fields have suddenly become attractive. Known as \"stripper wells\", these are springing into production across the south - there are 65,000 in Oklahoma alone, typically turning out fewer than 10 barrels of oil a day. Along the highway running through Cushing, there is a small-scale oil well incongruously positioned in the backyard of a small printing firm.</p> <p>In Cushing's high street, a few hints of prosperity are appearing between pawn shops and cheque-cashing offices. A modern Mexican restaurant, Nuevo Vallarta, has appeared. The investment chain Edward Jones has opened an impressively refurbished office.</p> <p>Nursing a drink in the town's Buckhorn bar, local resident Larry Roe said Cushing used to be a \"ghost town\" but property prices are on the up and unemployment has shrunk.\"Back in the 90s, when oil had gone to hell, you might have had 20 cars parked out there on Broadway,\" he says. \"Now there are four or five times that number.\"</p> <p>Rick Reiley, the town's director of downtown development, is cautiously positive: \"The last three or four years have been the first time in a number of years that things seemed to be working to our benefit as a community.\"</p> <p>He is fatalistic, however, about the cyclical nature of the business: \"We're an oil town - we've been an oil town for a hundred years. We know there are ups and downs and we try to prepare ourselves for the downs.\"</p> <h2>Locals prepare for attack</h2> <p>As much as 75% of America's crude oil supply passes through Cushing and federal authorities are wary that a terrorist attack in the rural Oklahoma town could be devastating. More than 900 people took part in a drill called Operation Critical Crossroads which simulated disgruntled oil employees taking hostages and placing explosives on pipelines in the town. A command centre was established at Cushing's community centre and schools went into lockdown during the 2004 exercise. A Swat team zoomed in for a mock arrest, a fire was started to test emergency responses and teams from the FBI, the Secret Service, the Red Cross and the Department for Homeland Security converged in Cushing. </p> <p>\"There's no such thing as being 100% prepared but you do your best for what you see as a threat,\" said the mayor, John Henckel. Concrete barriers have been placed by roadsides to create checkpoints in a security alert. Oklahoma's national guard has a contingency plan to surround and isolate thousands of acres of oil storage tanks. At the time of the drill, John Lewis, the FBI's special agent in charge, was frank about the risk of an attack on Cushing: \"It would be a real catastrophe if someone hit it just right.\"</p>",
  "<p>A Shia Muslim was convicted of child cruelty yesterday after he forced two boys to flog themselves during a religious ritual.</p> <p>Syed Mustafa Zaidi, a warehouse supervisor, told the boys, aged 13 and 15, to beat themselves with a zanjeer zani, a wooden-handled implement containing five curved blades used when commemorating the death of Hussain, grandson of Muhammad and one of the most important figures in Shia Islam. Zaidi is due to be sentenced on September 24. </p> <p>Manchester crown court heard how Zaidi, 44, flagellated himself at an event held in January in Manchester until his back was bloody and cut. Others at the event also flogged themselves. Some of those present, fearing Zaidi would seriously harm himself, asked him to calm down. Zaidi agreed, only to turn his attention to the two boys.</p> <p>The 14-year-old, who was 13 at the time, told the jury that neither he nor the other boy wanted to injure themselves. He said Zaidi was insistent with the older boy, \"pulling him and pushing him, 'keep doing it', telling people 'this is a sad moment and look, he's not doing it'. </p> <p>\"He goes, 'I don't want to do it, I don't want to do it'. He kept pressuring him, make him do the knife thing, pulling him, trying to get his T-shirt off, pulling and pushing him. He was saying, 'just do it, just do it'.\" He said the 15-year-old \"swung it once or twice and said 'I don't want to do it any more'.\" The older boy was then pulled away by another man. </p> <p>After the ceremony, the boys went home to their mother, who noticed several deep wounds on their backs and multiple slash wounds. She took them to Manchester Royal infirmary and the matter was reported to the police. </p> <p>The boys, who cannot be named for legal reasons, admitted they wanted to beat themselves, but not under duress and not using Zaidi's zanjeer zani. They also said they had flogged themselves with a smaller zanjeer zani from the age of six in Pakistan.</p> <p>Carol Jackson, for the Crown Prosecution Service, said the prosecution was not an attack upon the practices or ceremonies of Shia Muslims, adding that the prosecution relied partly on evidence given by the president of the local Shia community centre. It was the first case of its kind to be prosecuted by the CPS. </p> <p>For Shia Muslims the death of Hussain is a period of intense mourning, leading some to beat and whip themselves. The practice is not compulsory and some Shia authorities prohibit it, while others say it should be done only if certain conditions are met. </p> <p>Safdar Zia, general secretary of the Jaffria Islamic Centre, said Shia Muslims in Manchester would now try to work with the police and the CPS towards a code of practice: \"We are not above the law.\"</p>",
  "<p>The LPGA tour, the leading tour in women's golf, last night stood accused of infringing the rights of many of its members after introducing a rule stipulating that players who cannot communicate in English will be suspended.</p> <p>The tour is believed to be the first in professional sport to introduce an examination in oral English for its members. \"For an athlete to be successful in the sports entertainment world we live in, they need to be great performers on and off the course, and being able to communicate effectively with sponsors and fans is a big part of this,\" said the LPGA's deputy commissioner Libba Galloway.</p> <p>Currently, the LPGA tour includes 121 players from 26 different countries. Of thoses, 45 are from South Korea - and it is those who are believed to be a particular target of the new rules.</p> <p>While the likes of Annika Sorenstam and Lorena Ochoa have been the most successful players on the tour in recent years, the Korean influence has grown, with its nationals regularly winning events - a trend that has helped the LPGA's profile in the Far East but which, it is widely assumed, damaged its commercial appeal in the US. \"Being a US-based tour, and with the majority of our fan base, pro-am contestants, sponsors and participants being English speaking, we think it is important for our players to effectively communicate in English,\" Galloway said.</p> <p>The LPGA's Korean contingent was told of the new rule at a meeting with tour officials last week. \"We agree we should speak some English,\" said long-time LPGA member Se Ri Pak, although she said a fine would be a more reasonable penalty than a suspension. \"When you win, you should give your speech in English. Mostly what comes out is nerves. Totally different language in front of camera. You're excited and not thinking in English.\"</p> <p>But if Korea's most famous female player was broadly supportive, some civil liberties activists in the US claimed a language requirement could violate state law. \"Florida law prohibits discrimination in public accommodations,\" said Howard Simon, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union in Florida. \"They may well violate Florida discrimination laws because language is a key element of person's national origin. People should be judged on their ability to perform a job. English fluency has no more to do with the ability to play 18 holes of golf than whether you walk 18 holes or ride 18 holes.\"</p>",
  "<p>Paperwork held by the government could, perhaps, make the difference between life and death for former British resident Binyam Mohamed. The dubious military courts of Guant\u00e1namo Bay are trying him for a capital offence on the strength of his own confessions; he believes the official documents will give him a lifeline by showing these confessions were extracted under torture. Last week the high court ruled that he had been illegally detained, and Mr Mohamed's own claims include that his captors cut his genitals with razors. Yesterday, however, the government was in court trying to restrict the disclosure of the papers to Mr Mohamed's lawyers.</p> <p>For a government opposed to both the death penalty and torture this is a remarkable position to be in. Its argument, backed up in court by a stiff missive from the US state department, is that handing the papers to the defence would sour transatlantic relations and so harm national security. When ministers pulled the plug on the police probe into BAE Systems in 2006, they claimed they had been forced to balance the rule of law against wider considerations - specifically a Saudi Arabian threat to cut off security cooperation. In Mr Mohamed's case, justice is once again playing second fiddle to diplomatic pressure, this time from the US.</p> <p>Pressure from Washington is a more serious business than pressure from Riyadh. However, just as the Saudi threats happened to advance British economic interests, the American demands being highlighted this time may be convenient for ministers too. Last week the high court ruled that MI5 had participated in Mr Mohamed's interrogation. Who knows what the full paper-trail would reveal about the veracity of the official claim that the British authorities \"do not participate in, solicit, encourage or condone the use of torture\"?</p> <p>Only a few years ago it might have seemed outlandish to question that stance, but a string of developments have sapped it of credibility. In February it was admitted that US rendition flights carrying terror suspects for secret interrogation had, despite repeated denials, passed through British territory. Then last month, before the ruling on Mr Mohamed, came allegations that UK officers were complicit in the torture of a British student in Pakistan.</p> <p>There is little prospect of these charges getting a public airing, after the Intelligence and Security Committee declined to get involved. Now the invoking of national security may keep the light away from the Mohamed case as well. No one doubts the security services face a tough job. But the allegations against them cannot be wished away. In the end, they can only be dealt with by rigorous scrutiny.</p>",
  "<p>Until this generation of hardware, game worlds were essentially dead. Beyond a few token splatters of mud and the odd unconvincing weather effect, the complex interplay of organic and elemental forces that shape our own environment were beyond the technical limitations of games machines. But with multicore PCs, Xbox 360 and PS3, physics is coming to the fore - game developers are investing into virtual worlds the same simulations of underlying systems that now enliven character animations.</p> <p>Ubisoft's forthcoming shooter Far Cry 2, for example, uses a realistic fire propagation system - torch an enemy hut, and if the wind is strong enough, you'll have a bushfire before you know it. Less dramatically, in the cute downloadable PS3 title Flower, you control the wind as it guides hundreds of floating petals through a rich natural environment. But what of water? Realtime fluid dynamics is a largely untouched area in games, for one compelling reason: it is mind-blowingly complicated. Graphics card giant NVIDIA has only just released its first demo showing <a href=\"http://www.bit.ly/gblog4\">realtime water movement</a>.</p> <p>The first game implementation will be forthcoming the sci-fi adventure Hydrophobia, developed by Blade Interactive. Trapped on a huge floating city, which is rapidly sinking, the player must battle an unpredictable sea that floods rooms in seconds, battering lead character Kate Wilson with tides and currents. Blade's R&amp;D head, Huw Lloyd, learned all he knows about fluid from his PhD in astrophysics. He developed the fluid-mechanics engine that supplies Hydrophobia with a realistic watery environment - <a href=\"http://www.bit.ly/gblog3\">see the demo</a>.</p> <p>As the lead games designer, Rob Hewson explains: \"The fundamental simulation provides the position, direction and velocity at every point in a fluid body, and that information is used to trigger a whole host of effects like surface foam, spray and splashes, underwater particles and bubbles.\" Why is this important? In this case, fluid provides puzzles and challenges - you can use it to flush out, mislead or drown enemies, or use it to elevate Kate to a higher area.</p> <p>Environments loaded with genuine physics form a real, unpredictable element of the experience. In military shooters, players will need to assess weather conditions before launching an attack - will the torrential rain provide cover, or will it cause that nearby river to burst its banks and engulf your vehicles? The future is about games in which emergent behaviour is as much a part of the scenery as well as the enemy AI and the sand box design structure. This is the point at which dead worlds come alive.</p>",
  "<p>\"I was staggered when I saw the works ... A new sense came upon me, a new heaven and a new Earth stood before me.\" So wrote William Hazlitt in 1798 when he saw the collection of old master paintings bought in France by the 3rd Duke of Bridgewater. </p> <p>Among them were two Titian masterpieces whose net worth 210 years on may now reach \u00a3300m - which would make them easily the most valuable paintings ever sold. Yesterday the national galleries in London and Scotland announced they are uniting in an attempt to buy them for the nation. </p> <p>The artist Lucian Freud described them as the most beautiful pictures in the world. Remarkably, they have been on public display almost since Hazlitt first saw them, for more than a century in London and since 1945 on loan at the National Gallery of Scotland in Edinburgh. But now their current owner, the 7th Duke of Sutherland, has announced he wants to sell them.</p> <p>John Leighton, the director general of the National Galleries of Scotland, said: \"It is the most important old master paintings loan to any public museum in the world and is of supreme importance to Scotland and the rest of the UK.\" </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337025552\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2008/08/28/callisto4602.jpg\" alt=\"Diana and Callisto by Titian\" width=\"460\" height=\"267\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Diana and Callisto by Titian. Photograph: National Gallery/PA</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Titians, Diana and Actaeon and Diana and Callisto, are part of a series of six mythological paintings by the Venetian master, painted between 1556 and 1559 for Philip II of Spain. The duke, with estates in Scotland and East Anglia, has most of his wealth contained in the collection and has decided to sell to diversify his assets.</p> <p>He has told the galleries he wishes the paintings, which have never been separated, to be bought for the nation at a knockdown price of \u00a3100m, and they have until the end of the year to indicate whether they can raise the money. If not, the paintings - or a number of others from the Bridgewater collection, which also includes three Raphaels, a Rembrandt and eight Poussins - will go to public auction next year.</p> <p>\"They could be one of the greatest acquisitions we could ever make. These are among the four or five pictures which would come to mind if one thought of what Titian stood for as an artist,\" said National Gallery director Nicholas Penny. It is the first time the two galleries have collaborated in such a way. If the paintings are bought, they will go on show for five years at a time in each gallery.</p> <p>The immediate need is to raise \u00a350m for Diana and Actaeon, or at least show the money is obtainable by the end of the year, though it would be paid in instalments over three years, with a similar deal to follow for the second painting from 2013.</p> <p>The galleries are approaching the Scottish and British governments to underwrite some of the cost as well as art funds and wealthy sponsors, though they have not ruled out making a public appeal.</p> <p>Both acknowledge that it is scarcely a propitious time to be asking for money, but Penny said: \"It is really important to realise that art is not there just for the country in its moments of affluence. It is a major solace for times of difficulty.

  "<p>Police and firefighters were yesterday waiting to search the gutted remains of a missing millionaire's mansion to establish whether he and his family died after the property was set ablaze by arsonists.</p> <p>Christopher Foster, his wife Jill and their 15-year-old daughter Kirstie have not been seen since fire swept through their home on the Welsh borders early on Tuesday morning, and the house is not safe to enter to carry out a search.</p> <p>The remote three-storey building and several outhouses on other side of a gravel drive were all ablaze when firefighters arrived and there were unconfirmed reports that a horsebox had been parked in front of the property's electronic gates, with its tyres punctured, to make their task even harder.</p> <p>Once the fire was brought under control, however, and the police inquiry was under way, it became clear that detectives could be facing more than just an arson and missing persons case. Instead, their inquiry is likely to delve into a labyrinthine story of wealth, failed business ventures and, possibly, suspicious deaths.</p> <p>Although Osbaston House, at Maesbrook, near Oswestry, Shropshire, may not be safe to enter for some time, officers were able to search some of the outhouses around the \u00a31.2m property. There they found the remains of three of the family's horses. There was no sign of the Fosters, however.</p> <p>Foster, 50, was a well-known and apparently popular figure in the area, and was thought to be a successful and wealthy businessman. He had established a number of companies which developed insulation technology for the offshore oil industry, with his wife acting as company secretary, and is said to have been a multimillionaire before his 30th birthday. He drove two Porsches and an Aston Martin, enjoyed riding and educated Kirstie privately.</p> <p>He had moved to Maesbrook from Telford about four years ago, and neighbours described him as friendly.</p> <p>One neighbour, Gordon Richards, said yesterday: \"When I saw Chris a few days ago, he seemed happy, but he said he was feeling the pinch at work because of the credit crunch.\"</p> <p>One of Foster's main companies, Ulva Ltd, had been placed into compulsory liquidation last year. A court order was issued on November 13 for the company to be wound up.</p> <p>Foster also became embroiled in a court case in which two former business associates were accused, but acquitted, of blackmailing him into handing over \u00a3100,000. He had alleged that the two men plotted to blackmail him after the collapse of a land deal in Cyprus. They in turn accused him of making a false blackmail allegation to conceal a plot to have one of the men assaulted - a claim Foster firmly denied. In a separate incident, when Osbaston House was burgled in 2006, he is said to have told neighbours that it was the result of a vendetta connected to his business.</p> <p>Around 80 police and civilian staff at West Mercia police are now involved in the investigation, which has been codenamed Operation Feedback. </p> <p>Police are treating the case as arson, but have not yet declared it a murder inquiry. As well as making inquiries into Foster's business background, the officers are examining CCTV footage from around the property . </p> <p>Detective Superintendent Jon Groves, who is leading the investigation into the fire and the family's disappearance , appealed for assistance from anyone who might have seen the Fosters over the bank holiday weekend or had any information on their possible whereabouts.</p> <p>He said: \"There was a CCTV system at the property, which has been recovered by officers and will be examined over the coming days. The house, a garage and stable block and another outbuilding were severely damaged. Two horses in the stable, and another in the outbuilding, have been found dead.\" Four dogs - three kept in outbuildings and one which lived in the house - were also missing, he said.</p> <p>The damage caused by the attack was so extensive that police and firefighters will not be able to search the house until it is examined by structural engineers and either reinforced or partly demolished. Once the structure has been made safe, a search for human remains will be the inquiry's top priority.</p> <p>Last night, Mrs Foster's brother, Roger Doley, told said he had been \"gripped with dread\" when neighbours told him of the fire. \"They won't be able to go into the house for a couple of days because it's unsafe, due to the extent of the fire. The waiting is killing me,\" he told the Wolverhampton Express and Star newspaper.</p> <p>The road leading to the 10 acre estate remained cordoned off yesterday and a police helicopter circled overhead. A neighbour who did not wish to be named, said: \"It is very, very weird. We have not heard anything. We don't know whether they were in there or not.\"</p> <p>Officers had been in touch with relatives of the Fosters, but the family still remained unaccounted for. \"Nobody knows until we can get access to the building,\" the neighbour said.</p>",
  "<p>It is still a man's world when it comes to rebuilding Britain's towns, with workplaces, schools, health centres, public transport and even public lavatories invariably being planned without taking into account the way many women live, a report published today says.</p> <p>Regeneration schemes traditionally cater far more effectively for men than women. Tilting the balance could cause a \"radical transformation\" of the social fabric, the study finds.</p> <p>The researcher, Gemma Burgess, of Cambridge University's centre for housing and planning research, said: \"Looking at gender issues in planning is central to success in economic regeneration. Social exclusion and regeneration cannot be addressed without taking gender issues into account because men and women experience poverty differently.\"</p> <p>Burgess, who will present the report to the Royal Geographical Society's annual conference in London, says inadequate policies on the use of land end up separating residential areas from where people work. Unless schools and shops are within easy reach of jobs, women's employment prospects can remain limited.</p> <p>Since April 2007, public authorities have had a \"gender equality duty\"; planners must consider the impacts of projects on both sexes. But the Cambridge research suggests few local councils have got to grips with the law. </p> <p>However, the Local Government Association said of the research: \"Councils simply won't recognise the findings ... A monumental amount of time and effort goes into making sure that new developments are places where people want to live and work, and that they have the whole range of local facilities they need.\"</p>",

  "<p>Taylor Nelson Sofres (TNS) has held talks with several potential bidders and plans to continue touting itself around the City over the coming weeks as the market research firm tries desperately to keep itself out of the clutches of Sir Martin Sorrell's WPP advertising empire.</p> <p>Sorrell moved closer to realising his ambition of grabbing control of TNS yesterday as his \u00a31.1bn hostile bid became the only viable offer on the table after TNS's preferred German partner, GfK, admitted it cannot get the financing together for a rival bid.</p> <p>But David Lowden, TNS chief executive, yesterday dismissed Sorrell's \"opportunistic\" bid as undervaluing the business and pledged to continue looking for an alternative. \"The board is focused on how to maximise the value for the company and for its shareholders and we have been out to talk to other parties to see whether there is interest there,\" he said. \"I am not really at liberty to say where we are in that process, but it is something that we would continue to do with a view to getting to a more realistic value for TNS.\"</p> <p>\"We just believe that the underlying value of this business is more than what has been put on the table.\"</p> <p>WPP's deal is worth 268.7p per share while Lowden reckons the company is worth 325p or above. Shares in the company closed yesterday at 267p after it announced its first half results.</p> <p>Lowden now intends to use the results, which showed revenues growing at more than 5% with underlying operating profits up almost 20% at \u00a354.3m, as a springboard as he tries to persuade investors not to go with Sorrell.</p> <p>Many of the company's longer term holders are understood to have sold their shares as TNS's stock price has risen over the past two months. As a result Lowden is likely to find himself facing a succession of hedge fund managers who want cash out of the business.</p> <p>\"We will be spending the next few weeks going and talking to our shareholders, both the hedge funds and long term holders, both to gauge their position but also to put forward the arguments why we believe WPP should be paying more,\" Lowden said.</p> <p>The protracted bid process has already cost TNS over \u00a38m in advisers' fees, which helped push its pretax profits down \u00a32.9m to \u00a331m for the six months to end June. But Lowden said the business is performing well, with orders for the second half of the year already 10% higher than they were at the same point last year.</p> <p>\"It would be disappointing to see shareholders sell to WPP at this price because there is so much more value that can be delivered,\" he said.</p> <p>WPP shows little inclination that it will raise its offer. Its first test will come on Friday when the first set of acceptances will be revealed. The number is expected to be minimal and the spat between TNS and WPP looks likely to run until the end of the offer period on September 30.</p> <p>Sorrell spectacularly gatecrashed the nil-premium merger between TNS and GfK this year, causing the German market research firm to try and find the cash for an all-out bid. Yesterday GfK confirmed that it was pulling out because \"the terms of the financing available did not enable a sufficiently compelling alternative cash offer to be made for TNS that was also economically in the best interests of the GfK shareholders\".</p> <p>The wealthy Herz family were apparently willing to stump up some of the cash, but its other potential backer, venture capital firm Apax, wanted more control of the venture than GfK was willing to countenance.</p>",
  "<p>Is research that uncovers flaws in transportation fare payment systems so dangerous as to justify censorship? That issue is being litigated once again in <a href=\"http://www.bit.ly/seth2\">a legal case</a> brought by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) against three MIT students and MIT itself. The MBTA uses an automated fare collection system (CharlieTicket and CharlieCard) somewhat similar to London's Oyster card. Also similarly, the security of the system has been broken and researchers found themselves in court as a result.</p> <p>A conference presentation was cancelled, and the students were subjected to a gag order regarding their work. The Electronic Frontier Foundation has led the <a href=\"http://www.bit.ly/seth3\">opposition to the gagging</a>, as part of a Coders' Rights Project \"to protect programmers and developers from legal threats hampering their cutting-edge research\".</p> <p>The legal complaint is a hash of inventive accusations, ranging from a claim that the defendants engaged in unfair and deceptive acts in trade or commerce (for which the MBTA wants triple damages), to asserting that MIT was negligent in its supervision.</p> <p>A key charge was based on a law called the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, which in part forbids \"transmission of a program, information, code or command [which] intentionally causes damage without authorisation, to a protected computer\", causing certain specified harm.</p> <p>If some terms are construed extremely vaguely and broadly, presenting security flaws can be claimed to constitute transmitting damaging information in violation of the law. A judge was convinced to side with the MBTA on this point initially, but later another judge <a href=\"http://www.bit.ly/seth4\">lifted the gag order</a>. But many charges remain unresolved.</p> <p>There are many principled reasons for openness in discussion of breaches, otherwise vendors have an incentive to hide problems and delay the costs of fixing vulnerabilities (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/aug/07/hacking.security\">Why being open about security makes us all safer in the long run</a>).

If one only hears about people who don't succumb to chilling effects, and never about those who do, it's easy to fallaciously conclude there's no problem. It's a comforting belief that censorious lawsuits are intrinsically self-defeating, and hence brought only by fools who don't realise how they will swiftly receive an ironic comeuppance. In truth, practical strategic considerations are very complex, and pragmatically each side benefits by increasing costs and uncertainty for the other.</p> <p>As specialised computer systems become more and more integrated into the utilitarian functioning of society, we will repeatedly face issues of their potential for subversion, corruption, and failure.

  "<p>Why has Dr John Bond, scientific support manager for Northamptonshire Police, been sent evidence by Boulder City Police Department in Colorado? It's because he's developing a new forensic technique that no other police force has. Thanks to his expertise, he's found a partial fingerprint on a 9mm brass cartridge case used in a 14-year-old Boulder City murder. </p> <p>Trained as a physicist, Bond has worked as a research fellow at the University of Sussex and even installed NHS software. He then joined Northamptonshire Police as the scientific support manager and, thanks to collaborative work with the University of Leicester, is now an honorary research fellow there, too.</p> <p>When he read a scientific paper from Swansea University two years ago, he noticed this: \"A serendipitous finding of our research is that the physical removal of a fingermark [fingerprint] from a metal surface, eg by rubbing with a tissue, may not necessarily mean that all the fingermark pattern information is lost.\" That research, measuring electrical potential to reveal latent fingerprints, was carried out by Prof Neil McMurray and Dr Geraint Williams.</p> <p><strong>Pointing the finger</strong></p> <p>Bond found the idea immediately intriguing. But, first, what is a fingerprint? \"What you've leaving is an impression of your fingerprint ridges in sweat,\" says Bond. Sweat is complex stuff: water, inorganic salts like sodium chloride, and other compounds like oils. Physical and chemical techniques help make these latent impressions visible.</p> <p>The researchers further suggested a reaction between sweat and the metal, making Bond consider the latter's electrical conducting properties. He then wondered whether the affected areas might show a different potential if a 2,500 volt electrostatic charge was applied - helping to reveal the original fingerprint.</p> <p>Going from inspiration to results has been tough. \"The challenge has been incorporating it into the day job,\" says Bond, who likes doing practical physics and solving scientific problems. Close cooperation with the University of Leicester has also helped. Everything needed, like a 2,500 volt supply, has been made, to save money. Working all hours, Bond even machined a tilting platform in brass at home. \"Anything we want, we make,\" he says. </p> <p>\"It's notoriously difficult to enhance fingerprints on brass gun cartridge cases. What you really want is the fingerprint of the guy who loaded the gun, not somebody who could say: 'I picked up the spent cartridge case in the road after it had been fired.' That's the key evidence you're after - who loaded the gun.\"</p> <p>When you handle a live round, you leave fingerprints behind. A couple of days later, and your sweat has very slightly corroded the metal through a chemical reaction. But once the gun is fired, sweat deposits are instantly vaporised which makes conventional fingerprinting useless.</p> <p>An early discovery is that firing the gun works in Bond's favour. \"If you heat the metal up after you put the fingerprint on, corrosion takes place instantaneously.\" That's also useful for arson investigation.</p> <p>All this has been experimentally investigated. Various metal disks and brass cartridge cases are touched by volunteers, left for different periods (and sometimes heated), then washed in hot soapy water. \"Anything left is the result of some chemical reaction initially between the [fingerprint] deposit and the metal,\" says Bond. </p> <p>Next, a 2,500 volt electrostatic charge is applied, followed by a fine carbon powder which sticks preferentially where sweat has corroded the metal - revealing the fingerprint pattern. His homemade tilting platform is used with tiny spherical beads to roll the conducting powder over the sample.</p> <p>What makes it stick though? \"It's classic electrostatic physics,\" says Bond who believes that changes in the atomic structure (perhaps copper oxides) makes the metal slightly less good (by 10-12 volts) as a conductor.</p> <p><strong>Big shot</strong></p> <p>Now patented, the nondestructive electrostatic enhancement process for fingerprint recovery has been successfully tested on spent brass cartridge cases. Publication in a scientific journal then led to a plea for help from Boulder City police. </p> <p>\"All casings have been subject to conventional fingerprint enhancement with negative result,\" says Bond </p> <p>Bond heated the brass casings to around 600C (1,100F) to react any remaining fingerprint salts, then applied 2,500 volts and the conducting powder. \"On one case I was able to develop a (very) partial fingerprint. Needless to say, the guys in Boulder were amazed that we had turned anything up.\" More US enquiries have been received and further research with the University of Leicester is planned. </p> <p>Prof Pierre Margot, of the University of Lausanne and a co-author of Fingerprints and Other Ridge Skin Impressions, thinks Bond's work is an interesting development. \"I do not really see any disadvantages and if it allows to detect even one print where other techniques fail, this can be described as a success,\" says Margot.</p>",

  "<p>It was life as normal yesterday on Ascension Island, a barren British territorial outpost that pokes out of the Atlantic ocean 4,044 miles from Land's End.</p> <p>The 1,100 residents were largely unaware that their volcanic rock was taking centre stage at the United Nations, where British diplomats were requesting sovereignty over 77,220 sq miles of submarine territory around the island.</p> <p>Yesterday's slideshow presentation in New York before 21 members of the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (UN CLCS) laying claim to an area of the ocean floor roughly the size of the UK's entire land surface is just the first of three submissions the UK is set to make under an international law that allows states to expand their jurisdiction.</p> <p>A senior Foreign Office official told the Guardian yesterday that the UK has decided to submit similar territorial claims for seabed surrounding the Hatton-Rockall area, west of Scotland, and South Georgia and the Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic.</p> <p>The reason for Britain's interest? The hope of tapping into new reserves of oil, gas and minerals. At present, countries can extract resources from the seabed up to 200 nautical miles from their shoreline. But with permission from the UN commission, they can extend their jurisdiction over the seabed up to 350 miles beyond a coastline. All they have to do is show that the ocean floor is a continuation of their continental shelf. </p> <p>Britain's venture is part of a global scramble for resources prompted by technological advances that make oil and gas reserves deep in the ocean more accessible. The UN commission has set a deadline of May next year for countries to submit maps and supporting scientific evidence.</p> <p>Britain's claims will anger diplomats in Denmark and Iceland, who have overlapping claims to the mineral-rich Hatton-Rockall area, and Argentina and Chile, which contest sovereignty over the seabed around the Falkland Islands.</p> <p>The decision follows a breakdown in negotiations between Danish and Icelandic lawyers and their British and Irish counterparts over the underwater shelf surrounding Rockall.</p> <p>The Foreign Office official, who has detailed knowledge of Britain's territorial claims, said that the UK government had invited Argentina for \"technical and legal\" discussions about the continental shelf around the Falkland Islands, but no talks had taken place since 2005.</p> <p>Agreement between neighbouring states is required if the UN commission is to award territorial rights, meaning some claims could take several decades to resolve, he said.</p> <p>\"Ideally we would like to reach agreement with all the parties where there are overlapping claims. But if it is not possible to resolve a dispute, then we will be preparing a submission [to the UN CLCS] anyway, as the UK.\" He added: \"I can confirm we will be making all three additional submissions by May 2009.\"</p> <p>He added that Britain \"reserves the right\" to lodge submissions over the British Antarctic Territory, although it has no immediate plans to do so.</p> <p>The Ascension Island claim means the UK has officially joined 11 other countries staking claims to submarine territory. A further 30-40 are expected to lodge claims, including some developing countries.</p> <p>Although it could take up to three years for the commission to rule on Ascension Island's continental shelf, the Foreign Office is confident of success. </p> <p>Speaking from his office overlooking a beach, Michael Hill, Ascension Island's administrator, said that the submission to the UN could only benefit residents. \"It is clearly, having read a bit about it, a very long-term project.\"</p> <p>Yesterday's delegation of legal and scientific experts, led by Doug Wilson, a legal adviser to the Foreign Office, and Lindsay Parson from the National Oceanography Centre, in Southampton, presented the commission with supporting geological and geophysical surveys.</p> <p>\"Ascension Island is going to be the only [territorial claim] that is relatively unproblematic,\" said Martin Pratt , director of Durham University's International Boundaries Research Unit. </p> <p>\"There could always be a scientific spanner in the works, but it's going to be a simple question of the commission assessing whether the areas claimed are legally part of the [island's] continental shelf.\"</p> <p>The vast Hatton-Rockall basin, off the west coast of Scotland, believed to be rich in hydrocarbons and mineral deposits, is likely to prove more controversial.</p> <p>It has been the subject of a seven-year wrangle between the UK, Ireland, Denmark and Iceland.</p> <p>Shuttle diplomacy appears to have reached stalemate. Recent meetings in Reykjavik, Dublin and Southampton failed to agree maritime borders. The Danes and Icelanders are likely to stake out extensively overlapping claims.</p> <p>Technological advances had raised expectations that wells could soon operate commercially, even in the storm-blasted seas around Rockall. The government is already offering exploration blocs in the area close to the outer limit of the UK's 200 mile economic zone.</p> <p>The UN regulations do not, however, allow small islands that have never been inhabited to be the basis of claims for extending control over the surrounding seabed. Britain's claim on Rockall is currently based on measuring out from the island of St Kilda in the Outer Hebrides. </p> <p>Rockall was Britain's last colonial land grab, annexed by a boarding party from HMS Vidal in 1955. A plaque was cemented atop the desolate rocky pillar that protrudes 63 feet above the Atlantic. The sailors sang \"God Save the Queen\" and gave three cheers.</p>",
  "<p>Back in the early 1990s, email was a privilege granted only to those who could prove they needed it. Now, it has turned into a nuisance that's costing companies millions. We may feel that we have it under control, but not only do we check email more often than we realise, but the interruptions caused are more detrimental than was previously thought. In a study last year, Dr Thomas Jackson of Loughborough University found that <a href=\"http://www.bit.ly/email2\">it takes an average of 64 seconds</a> to recover your train of thought after interruption by email. So people who check their email every five minutes waste 8.5 hours a week figuring out what they were doing moments before.</p> <p>It had been assumed that email doesn't cause interruptions because the recipient chooses <a href=\"http://www.bit.ly/email3\">when to check for and respond</a> to email. But Jackson found that people tend to respond to email as it arrives, taking an average of only one minute and 44 seconds to act upon a new email notification; 70% of alerts got a reaction within six seconds. That's faster than letting the phone ring three times. </p> <p><strong>Time out</strong></p> <p>Added to this is the time people spend with their inbox. A July 2006 study by ClearContext, an email management tools vendor, surveyed 250 users and discovered that 56% spent more than <a href=\"http://www.bit.ly/email4\">two hours a day in their inbox</a>. Most felt they got too much email - by January 2008, 38% of respondents received more than 100 emails a day - and that it stopped them from doing other things.</p> <p>Dr Karen Renaud, a lecturer at the University of Glasgow, and her colleagues at the University of the West of Scotland discovered that email users fall into three categories: relaxed, driven and stressed. \"The relaxed group don't let email exert any pressure on their lives,\" Renaud says. \"They treat it exactly the way that one would treat the mail: 'I'll fetch it, I'll deal with it in my own time, but I'm not going to let it upset me'.\" The second group felt \"driven\" to keep on top of email, but also felt that they could cope with it. The third group, however, reacted negatively to the pressure of email. \"That causes stress,\" says Renaud, \"and stress causes all sorts of health problems.\" </p> <p>Renaud's team discovered that while 64% of respondents claimed to check their email once an hour, and 35% said they checked every 15 minutes, they were actually checking it much more frequently - about every five minutes. For some people, checking email is no longer a conscious and deliberate act, but a <a href=\"http://www.bit.ly/email5\">compulsion</a> they are barely aware of.</p> <p><strong>Take a gamble</strong></p> <p>Dr Tom Stafford, a lecturer at the University of Sheffield and co-author of the book Mind Hacks, believes that the same fundamental learning mechanisms that drive gambling addicts are also at work in email users. \"Both slot machines and email follow something called a 'variable interval reinforcement schedule',\" he says, \"which has been established as the way to train in the strongest habits. This means that rather than reward an action every time it is performed, you reward it sometimes, but not in a predictable way. So with email, usually when I check it there is nothing interesting, but every so often there's something wonderful - an invite out, or maybe some juicy gossip - and I get a reward.\" This is enough to make it difficult for us to resist checking email, even when we've only just looked. </p> <p>The obvious solution is to process email in batches, but this is difficult. One company delayed delivery by five minutes, but had so many complaints that they had to revert to instantaneous delivery. People knew that there were emails there, and chafed at the bit to get hold of them. </p> <p>Another solution might be the notification system <a href=\"http://www.growl.info\">Growl</a> - which puts up a brief message on the screen with details such as the sender and subject line while the user is in other programs. Presently only available for Mac OS X, a version is being tested for Windows; though this, of course, causes the interruptions you are trying to avoid. Companies are beginning to take these problems seriously, although the \"no email days\" favoured by Deloitte and Intel have not proven effective. Deloitte's \"no email Wednesday\" was <a href=\"http://www.bit.ly/email6\">abandoned after a month</a> and Intel found that there was a \"clear incompatibility\" between the need of the pilot group to communicate asynchronously with colleagues and the <a href=\"http://www.bit.ly/email7\">avoidance of email for a whole day</a>. No email days don't work, says Stafford, \"because they don't help people to change their behaviour while they are actually using email. Once your email is back, you're going to respond to it in the same old ways unless you replace your bad habits.\"</p> <p><strong>Tools for the job</strong></p> <p>Instead, it's better to replace email with more appropriate tools. Roo Reynolds, a \"metaverse evangelist\" who is joining the BBC to work with social media, has moved away from email for everything but the most formal communications. Instead, \"I use other tools, where people are more comfortable hanging out. I've got a whole set of contacts who love Twitter, and if I want to reach them quickly then that's where they'll be.\"</p> <p>Reynolds has even begun to think of email as \"rude\" and invasive, preferring to use tools such as Twitter and Flickr. He also uses social networking sites such as Dopplr, which tracks people's travel, to find out if they are away before he contacts them, and status alerts from instant messenger or Twitter to help him decide if now is a good time to interrupt them. Other tools, such as blogs and wikis, have decreased the amount of email that he sends and receives, while RSS feeds and recommendations from friends and colleagues allow him to keep abreast of the most important news. </p> <p>For a tool that business depends so heavily on, we put little thought into how we use email. Dr Karol Szlichcinski, a business psychologist, recommends providing guidelines and training to give people \"ways of reducing the disruption caused by email, ways of managing email so that it doesn't run your day. Organisational norms build up, and people come to expect others to answer emails within a given timeframe, whether that email is important or not.\"</p> <p>We may think email is simple, but its ease of use is deceptive. For many, it's a boon, but for an increasing majority it's the tail that wags the dog. </p> <h2>How to keep control of that runaway inbox</h2> <p>If you find your mouse straying towards the \"check email\" button far too often, try these tactics:</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Turn off intrusive alerts. Anything that pops up, flashes, or goes \"ding!\" will interrupt you when you're trying to focus and will trigger a response to check your email. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Set your email client to display just the title and first few lines of the email, so you can easily decide if it really is important enough to deal with right now.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Use other tools. Twitter and instant messaging (IM) are both better for asking short questions of chosen groups. Wikis are better for collaborating on documents. Blogs are better for publishing information and having informal conversations. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Send fewer emails. Do you need to hit \"reply to all\"? </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Schedule your email. Set aside time each day to deal with your inbox and ignore it for the rest of the day. Most people check first thing in the morning and late afternoon.</p> <p><strong>Suw Charman-Anderson</strong> is an expert in collaboration and communications</p>",
  "<p>Ukraine's president, Viktor Yushchenko, could not have put it more starkly. Condemning Russia's decision to recognise the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, Georgia's two separatist regions, Yushchenko warned yesterday: \"Any nation could be next.\" </p> <p>In fact, Yushchenko was articulating what is now a commonplace in diplomatic circles: that having successfully \"done\" Georgia, the Kremlin might now turn its attention to Ukraine - and in particular its Russian-speaking region of Crimea.</p> <p>France's foreign minister, Bernard Kouchner, said the same thing. \"It is very dangerous ... there are other objectives that one can suppose are objectives for Russia, in particular the Crimea, Ukraine and Moldova,\" Kouchner said. </p> <p>In reality, the similarities between Ukraine and Georgia, and the Crimea and South Ossetia, are largely superficial. Crimea, a Black Sea peninsula, has a strong ethnic Russian majority. It became part of Ukraine during Soviet times, when it was transferred to the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic in 1954.</p> <p>Unlike South Ossetia and Abkhazia, which launched separatist wars in the 1990s, Crimea has been a successful part of the Ukrainian state. \"It is very pro-Russian, especially in Sevastopol. But it doesn't see itself as being against Ukraine,\" Igor Shevliakov, from the International Centre for Policy Studies in Kiev, said.</p> <p>He added: \"There is no conflict between Crimea and Ukraine. Crimean politicians like to speculate on the Russian topic. But it doesn't seem they are really interested in becoming part of Russia. They are more interested in keeping their own control over the peninsula. I don't think there is a consensus in Crimea about separating from Ukraine.\"</p> <p>Clearly, this threat preoccupies Ukraine's pro-western elite. Yushchenko denounced Russia's recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia as \"unacceptable\". Moscow's actions would hasten Ukraine's attempts to join Nato and the EU, and force it to increase its defences, he said.</p> <p>\"What has happened is a threat to everyone, not just for one country. Any nation could be next, any country. When we allowed someone to ignore the fundamental right of territorial integrity, we put into doubt the existence of any country,\" he told Reuters.</p> <p>Ukraine's pro-Russian former prime minister Viktor Yanukovich welcomed the Kremlin's decision. And Ukraine's prime minister, Yulia Tymoshenko, has been cautious not to criticise Moscow.</p> <p>Behind these statements are hard calculations ahead of Ukraine's presidential election in 2010. Yanukovich and Tymoshenko are likely to seek some accommodation with Moscow, should they win. </p> <p>Some observers believe there are solid reasons why Russia is unlikely to initiate another military adventure in Ukraine. Russia's elite have significant financial interests in Ukraine. \"It seems Medvedev is satisfied with the outcome of the Georgian conflict. I don't think they need a new conflict,\" Shevliakov said.</p>",
  "<p>Your feature on Chicago's proposal to establish a Milton Friedman Institute of economic research (Milton Friedman gives Chicago a headache, August 26) is misinformed in some important respects. </p> <p>You state: \"In postwar America, Friedman's market fundamentalism was regarded as lunatic-fringe stuff.\" This was never the case. I learned economics in Cambridge in the late 1960s. My professors followed Keynes and Marx, but they rightly made Friedman's work part of my undergraduate syllabus. Friedman's scholarship, not his opinions, made him one of the most influential economists of the 20th century. </p> <p>You state that Friedman \"worked for General Pinochet\". While Friedman visited Chile, he did not work for the dictator. His advice was that Chile should turn back from state control of economic life; in the long run, he argued, free markets and political freedoms go hand in hand.</p> <p>Finally, you give the impression that the mission of the proposed Friedman Institute is tendentious: \"The design and evaluation of economic policy requires analyses that respect the incentives of individuals and the essential role of markets in allocating goods and services ... design of public policy without regard to market alternatives has adverse social consequences.\" While such a statement may be infinitely qualified, few economists today would dispute the principle.<br><strong>Mark Harrison</strong><br>Department of Economics, University of Warwick</p> <p>What about that other great school of economics, headed by John Maynard Keynes?

  "<p>Prison and probation officers are the latest to join a protest against plans to build three \"Titan\" prisons holding 2,500 inmates each.</p> <p>Their unions are among 34 criminal justice organisations - also including Nacro, the crime reduction charity, Rainer Crime Concern, Inquest, Justice, Liberty and Women in Prison - to sign an open letter to the justice secretary, Jack Straw, published today in the Guardian.</p> <p>It says the Titan plan would cement the position of England and Wales as the prison capital of western Europe. \"Instead of rushing headlong into an expensive prison building programme, the government must ... focus on addressing the causes of the growing prison population.\"</p> <p>Colin Moses, the chairman of the Prison Officers Association, said: \"Building bigger prisons will achieve nothing. Clearly, the government are looking to build Titan prisons based on a need to save money.\"</p> <p>The growing opposition follows criticism from the National Council for Independent Monitoring Boards and reservations among prison governors about control problems. New research from the Prison Reform Trust claimed that smaller jails were more effective at cutting crime and the estimated costs for each Titan had already risen from \u00a3350m to \u00a3450m.</p> <p>But David Hanson, the prisons minister, said: \"Titan prison complexes will be the most effective way of providing value for money and reducing reoffending.\"</p> <p>The Justice Ministry plans to build three supersize jails.

  "<p>The LPGA tour, the leading tour in women's golf, last night stood accused of infringing the rights of many of its members after introducing a rule stipulating that players who cannot communicate in English will be suspended.</p> <p>The tour is believed to be the first in professional sport to introduce an examination in oral English for its members. \"For an athlete to be successful in the sports entertainment world we live in, they need to be great performers on and off the course, and being able to communicate effectively with sponsors and fans is a big part of this,\" said the LPGA's deputy commissioner Libba Galloway.</p> <p>Currently, the LPGA tour includes 121 players from 26 different countries. Of thoses, 45 are from South Korea - and it is those who are believed to be a particular target of the new rules.</p> <p>While the likes of Annika Sorenstam and Lorena Ochoa have been the most successful players on the tour in recent years, the Korean influence has grown, with its nationals regularly winning events - a trend that has helped the LPGA's profile in the Far East but which, it is widely assumed, damaged its commercial appeal in the US. \"Being a US-based tour, and with the majority of our fan base, pro-am contestants, sponsors and participants being English speaking, we think it is important for our players to effectively communicate in English,\" Galloway said.</p> <p>The LPGA's Korean contingent was told of the new rule at a meeting with tour officials last week. \"We agree we should speak some English,\" said long-time LPGA member Se Ri Pak, although she said a fine would be a more reasonable penalty than a suspension. \"When you win, you should give your speech in English. Mostly what comes out is nerves. Totally different language in front of camera. You're excited and not thinking in English.\"</p> <p>But if Korea's most famous female player was broadly supportive, some civil liberties activists in the US claimed a language requirement could violate state law. \"Florida law prohibits discrimination in public accommodations,\" said Howard Simon, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union in Florida. \"They may well violate Florida discrimination laws because language is a key element of person's national origin. People should be judged on their ability to perform a job. English fluency has no more to do with the ability to play 18 holes of golf than whether you walk 18 holes or ride 18 holes.\"</p>",
  "<p>A man who ran an illegal armaments factory converting replica submachine guns into lethal weapons was yesterday convicted of supplying guns used to kill eight people.</p> <p>They included Michael Dosunmu, a churchgoing teenager shot by mistake as he slept in his own bed in south London. Another weapon was used during the robbery in which PC Sharon Beshenivsky was murdered three years ago in Bradford.</p> <p>Grant Wilkinson, 34, was convicted at Reading crown court of buying replica MAC-10 submachine guns and converting them into lethal weapons. Police said his operation, carried out from a shed in Berkshire, was one of the largest they had ever discovered. They believe it produced 90 guns, some of which were used by teenagers carrying out murders on London streets.</p> <p>Wilkinson bought the replicas claiming to be involved in the making of a James Bond movie, and then turned them into lethal weapons which forensic scientists linked to 52 shootings across Britain.</p> <p>The gun factory produced weapons and bullets linked to nine murder scenes, including the shooting of PC Beshenivsky. Detective Chief Superintendent George Turner, who led the Thames Valley police investigation, said: \"There can be no underestimating the impact of Wilkinson's actions - his conversion of imitation weapons allowed criminals to arm themselves with guns capable of killing and maiming people. We have significantly disrupted an organised crime group that had been supplying large quantities of automatic weapons and ammunition into criminal networks.\" </p> <p>Wilkinson paid \u00a3500 for the replica MAC-10s, which are made in the UK. After conversion, they were sold for \u00a32,500, including ammunition. It is believed middlemen sold them on to criminal gangs.</p> <p>Wilkinson bought the replicas from Sabre Defence Industries, which had supplied previous Bond movie productions. Using the false name Wilson, he bought 90 guns and ammunition in batches and paid \u00a355,000 in cash.</p> <p>But company director Guy Savage became suspicious of Wilkinson, who he said was \"desperately disorganised\", and secretly took his photograph on his mobile phone. The picture was later handed to police. Savage told the court: \"He was acting in a way that made the hair on the back of your neck stand up.\" </p> <p>The gun factory was discovered by chance. Wilkinson converted the submachine guns into lethal weapons in two garden sheds behind a derelict property in Three Mile Cross, near Reading.</p> <p>One shed was used as a workshop and the other was sound-proofed as a firing range for testing. Police were called in July 2007 after tenants in a nearby house accidentally came across the sheds.</p> <p>Officers discovered expensive industrial equipment used to smelt and cut metals. They also found 27,700 spent cartridges at one shed and another site. The cartridges had been bought from gun clubs and could be converted into live ammunition.</p> <p>Before the sheds were discovered, police had already started to link several of the shootings. Days after the discovery, they linked the sheds to the production of weapons used in London shootings.</p> <p>Dosunmu was sprayed with bullets from a MAC-10 after his killers mistook him for his older brother, whom they had intended to kill in a criminal feud.</p> <p>His father, Rasak, 51, said: \"You are talking about blood money - this is not a legitimate business or legitimate money. He is selling the guns to the underworld just to kill people and it's all because of greed.\" His mother, Shakira, 46, added: \"I think he [the gun-maker] is as guilty as the people who are using the gun.\"</p> <p>Wilkinson used his profits to dine at upmarket restaurants and stay at hotels. He was convicted of a series of offences, including conspiracy to convert an imitation firearm into a firearm, conspiracy to sell or transfer firearms and ammunition, possession of a firearm with intent to enable another person to endanger life and possessing a prohibited firearm, namely a MAC-10 submachine gun. A second man, Garry Lewis, was cleared of all charges. </p> <p>For two years, guns from the factory were responsible for a fifth of the shootings in London, before which the use of MAC-10s had been rare. Turner added: \"It is clear that the usage in crimes in the UK of MAC-10s can be directly linked to the factory at the Briars.\"</p> <p>Of the 90 replicas bought by Wilkinson, police fear that all were converted. Eleven were found at the factory or nearby, and 39 have been recovered after police investigations. Police yesterday offered a \u00a310,000 reward for information leading to the recovery of the outstanding 40 weapons, with most feared to be in the hands of London gangsters.</p> <p>Claudia Webbe, of the Trident Independent Advisory Group, which monitors the way police investigate shootings involving black teenagers in London, said: \"The availability of these weapons is clearly fuelling violence on our streets.\"</p> <p>The link between the shootings and the suburban machine-gun factory was made by forensic scientists examining thousands of bullets.</p> <p>Police say even their own firearms officers find they have difficulty in using a MAC-10 accurately.</p> <p>Wilkinson will be sentenced today.</p>",
  "<p>It was 1973. After five years of critical praise yet low sales, the prodigiously talented Todd Rundgren finally had his moment. Introduced by the Four Tops, he would play his intense, blue-eyed soul hit Hello It's Me on the US TV show Midnight Special. Rundgren - never one for denim, leather, or the de rigueur cheesecloth of the singer-songwriter - had a brainwave: he would perform the song dressed as half-man, half-peacock. Rundgren, from Pennsylvania, was hoping to make a seismic impact. But the peacock plumage turned out to be commercial suicide. He never scored another major hit.</p> <p>As if he cared. Rundgren was a pop maverick: one of those fabulously eccentric characters who, thanks to a mixture of independent spirit and sheer bloody-mindedness, have created some of our most enduring (if often uncelebrated) music - in spectacularly unconventional careers full of bizarre twists and turns. Mavericks are loners. Their stories often contain a strong element of control freakery, something I discovered when I was asked to put together a season of films about mavericks for the Barbican in London.</p> <p>Unknown in this country but an eastern bloc legend, Dean Reed was a would-be teen idol working out of Holly-wood. He was a toothpaste ad man's dream: deep tan, perma-grin; it hardly mattered that his voice was a little less solid. Whichever way you read him, Reed was so square he was a cube - not obvious maverick material. But fate stepped in when Our Summer Romance, one of his sub-Ricky Nelson ballads, became a hit in South America in 1962. He toured Chile and was shocked by the extremes of wealth and poverty. He developed strong socialist tendencies, spoke out against US foreign policy, and played free shows in barrios and prisons. To knock some sense into him, his manager - a Czech baroness who had seen communism at close quarters and thought her charge naive and delusional - packed him off to play Moscow. Reed loved it, stayed out east and became a Marxist poster boy, a blonde Cali kid singing Elvis songs in red propaganda movies.</p> <p>Mavericks aren't always such clear-cut heroic figures. Take PJ Proby. Originally he was James Marcus Smith, a Texas boy with a voice that could mimic, if not better, pretty much any 1950s rocker. He released a screamer called Go Girl Go under the name Jett Powers, but it did nothing. His break came when he was introduced to British TV director Jack Good, then whisked over to London in 1964 where he instantly became an event. </p> <p>His songs Hold Me, Together, and a dadaist take on West Side Story's Somewhere all went top 10. He wore his hair in a ponytail, roared \"Am I clean? Am I pure?\" on stage, and split his velvet trousers at a gig. Perfect tabloid fodder. But when the trousers split again, it became problematic, and he was barred from certain venues. The hits dried up. He has since had umpteen comebacks, many fleetingly successful but, almost always, Proby has screwed up. There have been bankruptcies, an allegation that he shot his wife (he was acquitted), even a stint as a shepherd in Huddersfield. Off the drink now for 15 years, Proby has been touring with fewer hitches. He should write his autobiography. Nobody would believe a word.</p> <p>Some mavericks' stories are simply tragic. Gary McFarland showed no great interest in music until he joined the army in his 20s, when he was introduced to jazz. Soon, he was playing trumpet, trombone, piano - before settling on the vibes. He won a scholarship to the Berklee College of Music and was recording a year later; fellow jazzer Gene Lees described him as an \"adult prodigy\".</p> <p>McFarland loved the Beatles, Stan Getz, big film scores; he wasn't afraid to mix them up, and was duly ostracised by the straight jazz set. By the end of the 1960s, he'd written a ballet (Reflections in the Park), and an a orchestrated jazz protest album (America the Beautiful), and was moving into a unique, somnambulant pop sound with the beautiful Butterscotch Rum in 1971. Then, in a New York bar one night, someone spiked his drink with liquid methadone, and he dropped dead on the spot, aged 38.</p> <p>Though it doesn't end in death, the story of Dolly Mixture is a similar tale of unfulfilled promise. A three-piece British girl group who sang harmonies, eulogised the Shirelles, wore bowlcuts and clothes from Oxfam, Dolly Mixture ignored the agit-punk zeitgeist. None of this sounds too radical today, but, arriving in the late 1970s, they were regarded with disdain by the press and other female musicians alike. Their attempts to be taken seriously weren't helped by the fact that two of the members looked like they were barely teenagers.</p> <p>At a time when sexual politics were deemed essential lyrical content (contemporaries were writing songs with titles like Sex Without Stress), Dolly Mixture covered the Love Affair's bubblegum soul hit, Rainbow Valley. To rub it in, a rival girl group called the Mo-Dettes appeared in 1979; they had a singer with a French accent, wore tighter tops, sang a spiky cover of Paint It Black, and bagged a major label deal. Dolly Mixture resorted to a privately pressed double album of their demos.</p> <p>All of this would sound like nothing more than a hard luck story if it wasn't for the quality of their songwriting. After we saw them play in Croydon in 1982, my Saint Etienne colleague Pete Wiggs was moved to say, with heartfelt teenage sincerity: \"They've got better songs than the Beatles.\" They split in 1985. Their timing was excruciating. Around the corner were two movements - C86 and Riot Grrl - that heavily cited their independent, floral-print and bovver-boot feminism.</p> <p>Come the dawn of eBay, none of Dolly Mixture's records could be found for less than \u00a350. They prove that you don't have to wear peacock plumage or burn your own house down (yes, Proby again) to be a maverick. Simply hiding your burning light can count, too.</p> <p><strong>Pop Mavericks</strong> is at the Barbican, London EC2, from Tuesday until December 2.

  "<p>In Beijing, let us not forget, there were official areas for protests where nothing happened. Why? Because to stage your protest you had to file an application form to the thought control authorities. In a free society, criticism or offence does not have to be signalled in advance, much less pre-approved. That spontaneity runs many risks essential to freedom, one of which is that righteousness may be offended.</p> <p>This is a fairly lofty preamble to Ben Stiller's new picture, Tropic Thunder, an untidy but energetic satire on Vietnam war movies that makes fun of things such as the grandiloquent attitudinising of many films, the engineering of their special effects, the spectacle of their visceral upheaval (blood and guts spilling out), the sanctity of disabled people, putting on blackface, the cult of Nick Nolte and the prestige of Tom Cruise. You have to see the film to place all these \"attacks\", and it will be up to you how deeply you are disconcerted. Nolte and Cruise can, and do, look after themselves. The protest in the US against the film has come from disabled people.</p> <p>I don't want to spoil the film for you (and it is often very funny), but there are passing jokes about mentally retarded people - or about the way political correctness sometimes turns pious over them. Pause, for a moment. I have written pieces in the past where well-intentioned editors have queried the usage of words like \"retarded\". But the timidity in correctness is the subject of Ben Stiller's rough humour.</p> <p>Some people in a society as large as the US's cannot keep pace with ordinary thought. Some cannot move a limb. Some cannot hear or speak. Some are very short or very large. Some are wicked. And in a normal, humane, sympathetic society, those aberrations are observed and assisted. So they should be - that candour is our only way of noting that we have a president who cannot read, think, remember or observe his own offences in office. I hope that sentence offends him, and I hope he recollects we both live in a society where that level of offensiveness is in order.</p> <p>Tropic Thunder, it seems to me, never suggests Stiller believes mentally retarded people are a joke. But he grows weary with those who cannot see the risk of bogus protectiveness in correct political expression. He might even say, with me, that our excessive respect for flaws could have something to do with the US's woeful inability to impeach President George Bush.</p> <p>Movies are very seldom offensive. In the golden days of popular cinema, it was an unwritten rule that studios ignored all those subjects likely to cause upset. Gradually this led to the vague dream of an utterly homogeneous society. This dream was a myth. It cannot come to pass. In other words, the freedoms that Americans possess through the constitution endorse the vigorous criticism of people - whether they are film-makers, presidents or ordinary citizens.</p> <p>When Tropic Thunder opened in the US, protests only drew attention to it. The film has done well, and I don't think it has done one thing to undermine the essential good nature and sympathy of Americans towards any kind of limitation. But this is a country filled with sentimental sympathy for those with disadvantage - and no universal health system. Any proper history of liberty will observe the lively bloodstream of satire and indignant protest. The arts, the press - any open forum for opinion - are the cockpit where anger flourishes. </p> <p>Tropic Thunder is not an \"important\" film, or even a very good one. No matter. Larry Flynt's satires were seldom very funny. But his right to express them was vital. Backing away from blunt or impolite description is Pelosi-ism - the nice manners that prevented the speaker of the House of Representatives from launching impeachment against her \"nice guy\" boss.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> David Thomson is author of the New Biographical Dictionary of Film</p>",
  "<p>The Guinness Premiership is feeling no effects of the slowdown in the economy. Its pre-season launch was held yesterday in the ostentatious splendour of a Park Lane hotel, two new commercial partners have come on board, including the chain that owns the hotel, while a third has renewed its deal for another four years.</p> <p>In addition, the Premiership has found a terrestrial outlet with ITV4 showing an hour-long highlights programme on the Sunday of every league round, repeated on ITV1 the following Tuesday. Not even the threat of the experimental law variations, designed in part to drag the English game away from a perceived obsession with rolling mauls and penalty kicks at goal, could dampen the upbeat mood in the run-up to the first round of matches on Saturday week.</p> <p>\"These are tough economic times for some, but backers will always relate to quality and success,\" said Mark McCafferty, the chief executive of Premier Rugby. \"Sponsors have seen the way we have developed as a competition and we are delighted to have found the regular slot on terrestrial television we have long been looking for.\"</p> <p>For the first time since he took over in 2005, McCafferty can enjoy the start of the season without being engaged in an arm-wrestle with Twickenham. The clubs and the Rugby Football Union's agreement on the management of elite players came into force last month and a review of its progress will be conducted in December.</p> <p>\"By then, we will have had the November internationals and rounds of the European and Anglo-Welsh competitions,\" said McCafferty. \"What is significant is that the success of the agreement will be measured not by just how England are doing but how the clubs are faring. We only won one out of three cross-border tournaments last season and want to put that right.\"</p> <p>That was Bath's success in the European Challenge Cup, a competition that is set for an overhaul with English clubs prevailing in seven of the last eight seasons. \"Our view is that Europe needs a second tournament, but a stronger one than we currently have,\" said McCafferty. \"One idea currently being looked at is whether to include some of the early fallers in the Heineken Cup playing in the knockout stage of the Challenge Cup.</p> <p>\"Last season, that would have meant the likes of Wasps, Leicester, Biarritz and Llanelli Scarlets, all big brands, continuing their European campaigns. It is something football does after the group stage of the Champions League with third-placed teams going into the Uefa Cup. It is an idea worth exploring.\"</p> <p>The Anglo-Welsh Cup is in its final season in its current form. The agreement with the RFU means the Premiership clubs are looking for a tournament to be played in the months of November, February and March, when players are away on international duty and clubs will take a break from the Premiership campaign.</p> <p>\"The emphasis will be on development, but there are only 32 players in the elite England squad so it will not be a tournament short on quality,\" added McCafferty. \"We are talking with Wales and I think there will be scope for clubs from our first division and the Welsh Premiership to take part as we look to expand the game.\"</p> <p>Last season's Premiership was the most notable in terms of attacking play. Ian McGeechan, director of rugby at the Premiership champions, Wasps, is confident the experimental law variations will not lead to a drop in standards despite the generally acknowledged drop in quality in this season's Tri-Nations.</p> <p>While Saracens' new director of rugby, Eddie Jones, has publicly wondered if the variations had been pulled out of a cereal packet by the International Rugby Board, McGeechan said: \"I have been speaking to coaches in South Africa this summer and I do not think the variations will lead to a change in the game's core values.\"</p>",
  "<p>The crevasse-like furrows in Gordon Ramsay's craggy brow may appear to be etched a little more deeply today and his language even less temperate than usual. </p> <p>Still reeling from the savage attack delivered four weeks ago by his former protege Marcus Wareing, Ramsay has now been toppled from his place as the undisputed king of the London restaurant scene by his erstwhile friend.</p> <p>According to the latest edition of Harden's restaurant guide, P\u00e9trus - where Wareing is head chef - has overtaken Ramsay's eponymous Chelsea outpost to win the accolade of the capital's finest top-end restaurant. </p> <p>\"Marcus Wareing is emerging from Ramsay's 'shadow' as the proprietor of what is now clearly the best restaurant in London,\" Peter Harden, co-editor of the guide, said. \"In the end, though, it is hardly surprising than an impassioned individual concentrating on one establishment - such as Marcus Wareing - has overtaken the flagship of an ever more celebrity-driven empire where the 'name' chef is rarely present.\" </p> <p>Harden then decided to dish up the familiar accusation that the irascible Ramsay is now spending more time in the boardroom than the kitchen.</p> <p>\"It is the disappointing standards at Ramsay's three most recent 'mass-market' openings which are most immediately concerning. Each of them - The Warrington, Devonshire House, and Foxtrot Oscar - is nominated in roughly one in every three of the survey reports they attract in the 'most disappointing meal of the year' category. These newcomers are so uninspired in concept and so erratic in performance that - if they were opened by independent operators - they would likely be closed within a year.\"</p> <p>But said, Harden, there was still time for Ramsay to recover his reputation as top dog. \"What he urgently needs to do ... is to stop chasing media attention across the globe, and to start putting some real effort into improving standards at the restaurants in his London heartland.\" P\u00e9trus, which is based at the Berkeley hotel in Knightsbridge, is part of the Ramsay restaurant empire - but not for long. Following their falling-out, Wareing will soon assume control of the restaurant, which will be renamed Marcus Wareing at the Berkeley.</p> <p>Ramsay - whose televisual CV includes Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares, Hell's Kitchen (UK) Hell's Kitchen (US), The F-Word and the Extras Christmas Special - would not comment directly yesterday. However, his company, Gordon Ramsay Holdings, issued a statement that appeared remarkably graceful at first glance:</p> <p>\"We are very proud of the huge success of P\u00e9trus, which was opened by GRH in March 1999, and as a company we have been instrumental in continually raising its game to help it evolve into the restaurant that it is today.\"</p> <p>Fortunately, though, a soup\u00e7on of the familiar cynicism and combativeness eventually seeped through: \"GRH have taken the one and two top spots in the current Harden's guide, which is surely cause for plaudits rather than the inevitably negative spin that the guide's editors have chosen in order to generate publicity for their guide.\" </p> <p>Wareing said: \"I am incredibly proud to have achieved this accolade, particularly from such a respected guide as Harden's.\" </p> <p>Team Ramsay begged to differ, signing off their statement with this coup de grace: \"It is our feeling that the writers of restaurant guides such as Harden's vary in their opinions from food guides such as Michelin, and it is the latter that our industry as a whole looks to as the ultimate gauge of success.\"</p> <p>The row between the two men, who were once so close that Ramsay was best man at Wareing's wedding, is thought to have erupted after the Berkeley hotel decided it wanted to work directly with Wareing after its contract with GRH expires this September.</p> <p>Whatever the cause of the disagreement, Wareing was still feeling raw at the end of July. The acrimonious split became public knowledge then when Wareing - who seems just as susceptible to macho rhetoric as Ramsay - went on the offensive, telling a food magazine he felt \"constrained, confined and trapped\" by his one-time mentor and \"wouldn't give a fuck\" if he never spoke to him again. </p> <p>\"If I never speak to that guy for the rest of my life it wouldn't bother me one bit,\" he told Waitrose Food Illustrated. \"Wouldn't give a fuck. I admire Gordon. But would I lose sleep knowing he wouldn't be there? No chance. When you wake up in the morning and look in the mirror and all you see is a man who is constrained, confined and trapped, then you've got to change.\"</p> <p>He then went on to plant a very dangerous idea in Ramsay's head: \"Put a gun to my head, shoot me, put me in a box and bury me because if you don't, I'll come back and come back. I'll never give up until I get where I want to go.\"</p> <h2>Two of a kind</h2> <p><strong>Gordon Ramsay</strong></p> <p><strong>Age </strong>41</p> <p><strong>Qualification</strong> North Oxfordshire Technical College, Banbury (HND hotel management, 1987) </p> <p><strong>Training</strong> Marco Pierre White and Albert Roux in London</p> <p><strong>Michelin stars</strong> Currently holds 10 within his group of restaurants</p> <p><strong>Books</strong> Numerous publiciations, including Passion for Flavour (1996), Gordon Ramsay Makes it Easy (2005)</p> <p><strong>TV</strong> Numerous programmes, including Hell's Kitchen, Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares, The F Word</p> <p><strong>Royal approval</strong> OBE (2006)</p> <p><strong>Famous dish</strong> Cappuccino of white beans with grated truffles</p> <p><strong>Marcus Wareing </strong></p> <p><strong>Age</strong> 38</p> <p><strong>Qualification</strong> Southport College, City and Guilds catering</p> <p><strong>Training</strong> The Savoy, then Le Gavroche, working with Albert Roux.

  "<h2>THE QUESTION</h2> <p><strong>What goes on at a raw food cookery class?</strong></p> <p>Nibbles was inclined to consider a 'raw food cookery class' something of an oxymoron, but we were happily proved wrong at an event at <a href=\"http://www.safrestaurant.co.uk/\">Saf</a>, Britain's first raw vegan restaurant. </p> <p>Over two hours, <a href=\"http://www.rawchef.com\">Chad Sarno</a>, the executive chef, explained why raw food is so healthy (something to do with enzymes), what kit you need to prepare it (a dehydrator, apparently) and what the vital ingredients are (nuts - definitely nuts). He cooked as he went, letting us into the secrets of some of Saf's most popular dishes.</p> <p>As may be apparent, we're a bit sketchy about the details, because we were distracted by the food itself: every time Sarno demonstrated a dish, his lackey plated up a miniature version for us to sample. While the ubiquitous vegan cheese was a little disconcerting, the food as a whole was intriguing and really rather ingenious.</p> <p>One thing became apparent: raw vegan food takes a lot of time, thought and preparation to bring it up to 'fine dining' standard. Saf's recipes are unlikely to appeal to the average home cook, who might find the cashew-chive boursin slightly daunting without the benefit of an industrial blender.</p> <p>On the other hand, the class was certainly an interesting way to spend a couple of hours, and bona fide vegans would no doubt pick up some very useful tips. Although it's not cheap at \u00a375, you do go away very well-fed - though one of Saf's delicious-sounding cocktails wouldn't go amiss.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>For details of upcoming lessons, including more hands-on master classes, visit the <a href=\"http://www.safrestaurant.co.uk/events.aspx\">website</a></p> <h2>IN SEASON</h2> <p><strong>Courgettes</strong></p> <p>We <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/jun/05/nibbles.foodanddrink\">featured courgettes</a> when they first cropped up in the veg box in early June, but it's high time to revisit them. After all, ennui can set in with any staple ingredient and - after nearly three months of solid sauteeing and stir-frying - courgettes are no exception. So what exciting recipes will re-whet your appetite for these delicate, but sometimes bland, mini marrows? We found inspiration from some top London restaurants.</p> <p>The good people at Saf recommend using courgettes as a low-carb alternative to pasta (and let's face it, if they don't know what to do with a courgette, no one does). Use a mandolin to slice the courgettes lengthways into paper-thin strips, then stack and cut into your desired pasta variety (eg thin for linguine or fat for tagliatelle). This method makes a virtue of the courgettes' blandness, as the vegetable is simply a foil for the pasta sauce. Blanch for a minute or two or use raw, with the (homemade) sauce of your choice.</p> <p>If you can get hold of any courgette flowers, try them <a href=\"http://www.saltyard.co.uk\">Salt Yard</a>-style. This is how to make a simple version of their signature dish: stuff the flowers with goat's cheese, dunk them in a light batter (try <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/apr/05/foodanddrink.growingyourown4\">Angela Hartnett's</a>) and deep-fry. Serve drizzled with your favourite honey. Naughty but very nice.</p> <p>Nibbles' favourite speedy supper is bruschetta, based on a <a href=\"http://www.rivercafe.co.uk/\">River Caf\u00e9</a> recipe. Dice your courgettes (a mixture of green and yellow is nice), and fry gently in olive oil with chopped garlic, lots of herbs (preferably marjoram, parsley and mint), and lemon zest and juice. Season and serve on bread that has been toasted, rubbed with garlic and drenched in olive oil. Top with an extra sprinkling of herbs and lemon zest, and a couple of slices of prosciutto for the non-veggies.

It is simply an excuse not to eat. And, indeed, Saf, which has done very well in the reviews, was positively rammed to the rafters, on a lazy Monday night in high summer, with very thin people, mostly women. (Don't get me wrong, it's not a complaint \u2013 better vegans than fat people.)<br><em><a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/food_and_drink/eating_out/giles_coren/article4557548.ece\">Giles Coren reviews Saf</a>, London EC2</em></p> <h2>BEST BUY</h2> <p>We recently sampled a new range of spice pastes that are perfect for those rare nights when you just don't feel like cooking from scratch - but you want something healthier than a takeaway. <strong>The Mighty Spice Company</strong>'s fresh, chilled pastes are great for stir-fries, curries and marinades, and contain no artificial colours, flavours or preservatives, just a handful of reassuringly recognisable ingredients. They come in three flavours: Chinese Szechuan, Thai Green and Indian Tandoori. We loved an off-the-cuff Szechuan beef and vegetable noodle stir-fry, ready in minutes. Find more recipe ideas and stockist details on the <a href=\"http://www.mightyspice.com/\">Mighty Spice website</a>.</p> <h2>TOP TIPPLE</h2> <p>There are only a couple of days left to sample the Wizard of Oz cocktail menu at <a href=\"http://www.skylonrestaurant.co.uk/\">Skylon</a> in London, created to celebrate the production of the same name running at the Royal Festival Hall. If you can't make it to the bar before the end of the month to sample such delights as 'Over the Rainbow' and 'Yellow Brick Road', then you can always console yourself with the regular cocktail list. We like the sound of 'Honey Lemon', despite the rather unimaginative name - here's how to make it at home:</p> <p><strong>40 ml Krupnik honey vodka <br>20 ml lemon schnapps <br>20 ml lychee juice <br>10 ml lemon juice <br>10ml maple syrup <br>1/2 lemongrass stem <br>2 slices of lemon</strong></p> <p>Muddle together the lemongrass and fresh lemon. Pour all the remaining ingredients into a cocktail shaker, shake and double strain. Serve in a chilled martini glass. Garnish with a twist of orange and a piece of lemongrass.</p> <h2>OFFER OF THE WEEK</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.morganm.com/home.htm\">Morgan M</a>, the best restaurant around for mollifying militant veggies and hardcore carnivores (they get a tasting menu each - both are superb), is celebrating its fifth birthday next month.

  "<p>Police and anti-violence groups called last night for tougher laws on deactivated firearms following Wilkinson's conviction.</p> <p>Realistic imitation firearms, such as the ones he bought, were banned last October under the Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006. But it is still legal to buy deactivated guns which, with the right knowledge, can be converted into live weapons.</p> <p>Jacqui Smith, the home secretary, unveiled plans at the start of the year to ban these types of guns, but ministers are still consulting on the matter.</p> <p>An outright ban would have repercussions for a number of legitimate organisations, including museums with collections of antique weapons.</p> <p>But Sue Fish, assistant chief constable for Nottinghamshire, called for swift action. \"The law has changed [in relation to replica guns] and we are working with the government to ... tighten it up further. The home secretary has said she would be looking into further types of firearms which are currently legal and freely available. We are hopeful this will happen because it is a loophole that needs closing.\" </p> <p>She added that sentencing guidelines needed to be examined as they were geared towards rogue gun dealers and not those such as Wilkinson who mass produced weapons for the criminal market.</p> <p>As a result, she said, the Crown Prosecution Service chose to charge Wilkinson not with supply - which carries a maximum 10-year sentence - but with a harder to prove offence of intent to enable another person to endanger life, which carries life. </p> <p>Claudia Webbe, vice chairman of the Operation Trident Independent Advisory Group, which works with the Metropolitan police to tackle gun crime in London's black community, called for an outright ban on all potentially convertible weapons. She said: \"We must make it impossible for someone to walk into a shop and buy a weapon that could be converted and used to injure anyone else.\"</p>",
  "<h2>A PC for editing AVC</h2> <p>I've bought a new HD video camera which records in AVCHD. When I looked at the Pinnacle editing software supplied with it, I read that the minimum requirements include an Intel quad core processor running at 2.66GHz. I have consulted PC World, Dell and HP, and none has a home computer running at this speed. What can I do?<br><strong>Richard Cooke</strong> </p> <p><strong>JS:</strong> AVCHD is one of the high-definition movie standards used by Blu-ray and HD DVD and allows for pictures that are 1,920 x 1,080 pixels. It is a highly compressed format, to save space, but as a consequence it requires a great deal of processing power to reconstruct the original image. What the camera salesmen don't tell you is that just displaying 25 of these large images a second is beyond many PCs, unless they have accelerated graphics. Editing them can be a nightmare, and a common approach (taken by Apple's Final Cut Pro, among others) is to transcode them into something that is easier to handle. The <a href=\"http://www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVCHD\">Wikipedia page on AVCHS </a>lists some of these converters. </p> <p>Editing native AVCHD is not, of course, beyond reach. However, such powerful PCs are generally not off-the-shelf items, but assembled to order. First, pick your Intel Core 2 Quad processor from Intel's spec sheet: the Q6700 is the cheap 2.66GHz chip, but there's a newer, better 2.83GHz version, the <a href=\"http://www.bit.ly/aj0015\">Q9550</a>. Next, look for a PC with that Q number, 4GB or 8GB of memory, and 64-bit Windows Vista. An example is the <a href=\"http://www.meshcomputers.com/Default.aspx?PAGE=PRODUCTVIEWPAGE&amp;USG=PRODUCT&amp;ENT=PRODUCT&amp;KEY=359130&amp;APPS=351520,234455\">Mesh Xtreme X9550GTX</a> with a Q9550, 8GB of memory, a terabyte of hard drive space, Blu-ray player and 24 inch widescreen monitor displaying 1,920 x 1,200 for \u00a31,199 inc VAT.</p> <p>On its own, Pinnacle Studio 12 will run OK on a 1.6 GHz Dual Core processor with 1GB of memory, so the problem is down to the videos you want to edit. You could reduce the PC hardware requirements by reducing the size of your videos. Instead of shooting 1,080p, for example, you could use 1,440 x 1,080 or go down to 720p (1,280 x 720 pixels), like broadcast HDTV. However, my experience is that editing MPeg-2 movies is a pig on a fast Pentium, and I'd expect editing MPeg-4 Part 10 (ie AVC) to be much piggier even on a quad core PC. I'd want more power, not less.</p> <h2>Newsletter mailing</h2> <p>I run a small business from home, and send a regular newsletter. I have a TalkTalk phone and broadband package. I now find that I am unable to send more than about 20 newsletters in a block.<br><strong>Annie Hall</strong></p> <p><strong>JS:</strong> I can't find any mention of this on the TalkTalk website, but internet service providers usually limit the number of emails you can send at once, to discourage spamming. However, I'd have thought 100 was a more reasonable number than 20. You could try contacting TalkTalk for help, but ISP email services are not a selling point but an overhead that I suspect most would rather be rid of. Larger companies, including the Guardian, often use outside services such as <a href=\"http://www.cheetahmail.com\">cheetahmail.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.jangomail.com\">jangomail.com</a> to send out promotional emails. You could try a local supplier such as <a href=\"http://www.subscribed.co.uk\">Subscribed</a>: there must be lots. These companies tend to be hostile towards anything \"spammy\" as it could affect their business.</p> <h2>Maximising battery life </h2> <p>What are your top tips for maximising the life of rechargeable batteries?<br><strong>Richard Brown</strong> </p> <p><strong>JS:</strong> Different kinds of battery require different approaches, so it's a bigger topic than it sounds. However, <a href=\"http://www.BatteryUniversity.com\">BatteryUniversity.com</a> provides comprehensive coverage and a handy summary in <a href=\"http://www.bit.ly/aj0016\">table form</a>. With the increasingly common Lithium-ion (Li-ion) types, the main advice is not to discharge them more than once a month: try to recharge them when they are on 20% or so. Alas, they are only good for a limited number of cycles and age even if not used. They may need replacing after 18-24 months or 350-500 cycles, but can last longer. It's always worth checking the device's manual for information and advice.</p> <h2>Blogs by location</h2> <p>Is there a way to search blogs by location?<br><strong>J Bourtoni</strong> </p> <p><strong>JS:</strong> Not really. There are blogs from all over the world sitting on the same servers run by American companies such as Google (Blogger) and Microsoft (Spaces), and there is no easy way to tell them apart. However, there are sites you can try, such as <a href=\"http://local.blogdigger.com/index.html\">Blogdigger Local</a>, <a href=\"http://www.PlaceBlogger.com\">PlaceBlogger.com</a>, <a href=\"http://www.feedmap.net\">feedmap.net</a> and <a href=\"http://www.globeofblogs.com\">Globe of Blogs</a>. Bloggers who want to be found geographically can make it easier by submitting their sites. In the longer term, there's a 10-year plan involving 74 nations called <a href=\"http://www.bit.ly/aj0003\">Geoss</a>, for Global Earth Observation System of Systems, which should encourage more location awareness.

  "<p>Summer is over and it's time to deal with all the snaps vegetating in your digital camera or cameraphone. It is a fair bet that despite the weather more photos were taken this summer than in any previous one, as a result of the explosive growth in digital cameras. Hundreds of companies are falling over themselves to host your photos for nothing. There are three categories: websites offering many gigabytes of free storage, a raft of places dedicated to photos and </p> <p>videos plus a new generation offering to archive your entire life online - if they are still there in 50 years.</p> <p>In terms of numbers, photo-hosting is turning into a three-horse race with Yahoo's <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/\">Flickr</a>, Google's <a href=\"http://www.picasa.google.com/\">Picasa</a> and <a href=\"http://photobucket.com/\">Photobucket</a> in the lead, each with around 40 million regular visitors, with <a href=\"http://imageshack.us/\">ImageShack</a> trailing in fourth place, according to recent ComScore figures. </p> <p>I am a Flickr fan and will stay for the moment because of its great community, but I have to admit the improvements Google will soon release for Picasa (a startup it bought a few years ago) are extremely impressive. There is a host of new features but the scene stealer is image recognition. I uploaded 80 photos from the iPhoto collection on my Mac (Windows has even more features) to Picasa through the Export function. They all contained faces. Picasa scanned the images (ie not tags) and presented them in groups of faces with similar patterns including many plucked from the background of a photo, all ready for me to add a name or email address. So in years to come, all the snaps of Granny Bertha could be culled from obscurity by a single search made by grandchildren.</p> <p>But that assumes your host site will still be there in the next century - and even if it is, computers or formats may have changed so much they will be inaccessible. This issue - which the British Library's Digital Lives project is addressing - is vital because numerous websites are in the pipeline, offering to become an archive or diary of your entire life. This offers the prospect of our lives being revisited 100 years hence not just by our descendants but by historians who could have access to a cornucopia of information about the way we live today.</p> <p>Some of these sites are UK-based, such as <a href=\"http://www.thetimesofmylife.org\">thetimesofmylife.org</a>, soon to be launched in the Cabinet Rooms by that personification of nostalgia, Dame Vera Lynn. This is not your typical Silicon Valley startup. It has been devised by Mark Hickman, who until a month ago worked in a paint shop. It is not available for pre-launch testing but will provide a timeline diary, in which you can put up photos, video, text, etc of your entire life day by day, including interviews with relatives. It sounds like a more practical version of the sophisticated Oxford start-up miomi.com, which attracted a blaze of publicity when venture capitalists swarmed around it but now just carries the message \"Service is currently unavailable\". These UK start-ups face competition from the likes of <a href=\"http://www.dandelife.com\">dandelife.com</a>, and also <a href=\"http://www.wiseline.com\">wiseline.com</a>, which chronicles your life in one long \"life graph\" and can be embedded in Facebook or wherever.</p> <p>The proliferation of lifetime diaries makes longevity a big issue. But there are some simple steps you can take to ensure your place in history. First, save all your files with a unique tag such as john-smithwxyz so, in theory, someone in 50 years can access all the relevant records with a single search term. Second, save images in multiple formats (eg Jpeg and Tiff) in case one becomes obsolete. Third, back up on to the web (via the huge storage that Google, Yahoo, Microsoft etc offer for nothing) as well as your hard disk and/or an external storage facility, such as a hard drive, that plugs into your computer's USB port.</p> <p>Above all, there is surely an opportunity for a trusted independent archive, maybe an offshoot of the British Library, which will secure all our data and still be there in future for our families or historians to delve into. That discussion has barely started.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:vic.keegan@theguardian.com\">vic.keegan@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>\"Captcha is the bane of the internet,\" says Matt Mullenweg, who runs the massively popular blogging site <a href=\"http://www.Wordpress.com\">Wordpress.com</a>. \"I can't figure them out myself half the time!\"</p> <p>He is referring to those squiggly, distorted images commonly seen when registering for internet services such as free email accounts or blogging sites. The user has to type the letters in the image before proceeding. Captcha stands for Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart. The idea is that humans can read the letters, but computers cannot, thus preventing automated scripts from registering.</p> <p>Websites use Captchas in an attempt to disrupt the spam and malware economy - but they are not working. \"Spammers and malware authors are able to break Captcha process,\" says Carl Leonard, a threat research manager at Websense Security Labs. \"As a result, we've seen an increase in the amount of mail sent out from reputable mail services such as Gmail, Hotmail and Windows Live Mail, and an increase in the number of blogs that host malicious content, or content that the spammers wish to advertise.\" Email accounts on such services are particularly valuable because spam filters cannot block them without also blocking genuine mail.</p> <p>Techniques to break Captcha are nothing new. First, if a human can read an image then the chances are that software can do the same thing. In 2005, a software developer, Casey Chesnut, <a href=\"http://www.brains-n-brawn.com/default.aspx?vDir=aicaptcha\">wrote a Captcha-breaking algorithm</a> and demonstrated it by posting automated comments to nearly 100 blogs to demonstrate their vulnerability. In response to this kind of attack, Captcha authors have devised tests that are harder to solve. Images may be more squiggly than they used to be, making them harder to break but also more troublesome for legitimate users. Other ideas include <a href=\"http://www.bit.ly/captcha3\">3D Captcha</a>, relying on object recognition rather than character recognition; or framing questions that are trivial for humans to answer but hard for software to parse. Some approaches work better than others, but there are a number of inherent problems. One is that many Captchas are inaccessible to the visually impaired, and will fall foul of accessibility legislation unless there is an alternative. Another snag is that spammers may play their trump card, using humans.</p> <p><strong>Human resources</strong></p> <p>\"Many attackers have found creative ways to entice humans to unknowingly solve the Captchas for them,\" says Jamie de Guerre, chief technology officer at Cloudmark. \"This relay attack involves copying the image served in a Captcha to a user somewhere else, having them solve the Captcha, and then copying their response back to the original website.\" </p> <p>Another option is to pay. Spammers have employed large teams of temporary staff to solve Captchas, effectively \"rooms of people\", usually in a third world country, sitting at a computer and solving Captchas.</p> <p>\"Most Captchas have been completely broken\" says Leonard, adding that the problem is getting worse. \"We're seeing more Captchas targeted, more Captchas broken. I don't see how the targeting by the malicious authors right now is going to go away. It's still in their interests to get hold of these valued accounts.\"</p> <p>Despite these issues, heavily attacked companies such as Microsoft are not abandoning the system. \"We are updating our Captcha system to be both more readable for customers but more difficult to break through,\" a spokesman said. \"Improvements include new image distortion logic, overlapping characters and dynamic monitoring capabilities to observe attacks in real time and make necessary adjustments to mitigate them. In addition, we continue to make advances to better prevent spammers from using Hotmail accounts, once created, to successfully send spam.\"</p> <p>That is all very well, but the failings of Captcha impact every internet user. It is not only a matter of more spam choking inboxes. Breaking Captcha enables networks of computers to post malicious content to legitimate sites. \"The huge increase in numbers of legitimate sites affected radically changes traditional trust relationships on the web,\" says Pete Simpson, the ThreatLab manager at ClearSwift. \"Steering clear of dubious sites has always been sound advice, but steering clear of legitimate sites is not an option.\"</p> <p>What can replace Captcha? \"There's probably going to have to be some kind of layered security,\" says Leonard, \"It's up to the industry sectors which and how many layers of security they wish to employ, dependent on what sort of site they have.\"</p> <p>Layered security means adding human or third-party checks to actions like registration, and then monitoring content later to check for malicious use. The trade-off is that as security increases, usability decreases. Heavy-handed security can easily kill the conversation on social networking sites which depend on making it easy for new users to engage with the community.</p> <p><strong>Safety net</strong></p> <p>In the end, it is just another angle on the woeful security that characterises today's internet. New authentication schemes such as OpenID, or Microsoft's CardSpace, may help as adoption increases. These systems make it possible to register for one site using credentials verified by another. Instead of having many sites with poor verification procedures, the internet could have a few sites with strong verification procedures, that are then used by others. The advantage for the user is that they no longer have to jump through multiple hoops for each new site they encounter. Such a system depends on receiving sites being selective about which third parties they trust to verify a user's identity. That said, the internet is a long way from adopting this level of security, and there is always a danger that whatever steps the industry takes to improve authentication, the scammers will keep up with innovations of their own. </p> <p>Mullenweg's answer is to focus on the content rather than the user. His Akismet system for preventing spam comments relies on a combination of secret algorithms and community reports, and has proved remarkably effective. </p> <p>\"Ultimately Captchas are useless for spam because they're designed to tell you if someone is 'human' or not, but not whether something is spam or not. Just because something came from a real human being doesn't mean it isn't spam, which is why content-based solutions like Akismet are the only long-term solution to the spam problem.\"</p>",
  "<p>Imagine turning up for work one morning to be greeted by your boss brandishing a syringe and a mini elastoplast. It quickly becomes apparent that dodging the looming needle will prove impossible because this is a compulsory company blood test measuring every employee's susceptibility to stress.</p> <p>The word at the water cooler is that should anyone's white-cell count exceed a certain figure during such, from now on frequent, blood-drawing exercises, their career prospects may well be damaged. Deemed \"pressure vulnerable\" they could face exclusion from important team activities.</p> <p>At lunchtime an army of uniformed men transform the office floor into what looks like a set for the filming of Dr Who with a sinister, bus shelter-sized structure as its centrepiece.</p> <p>This is the vastly expensive Cryopod. Built with materials devised by Nasa it contains an inner \"Cryo\" chamber chilled to -130C. Your boss casually informs you that spending four minutes inside his new toy freezes a human being's eyeballs and five minutes guarantees death. Alternatively, a 30-second visit fools the body into thinking it is dying, thereby forcing it to regenerate. </p> <p>He predicts that frequent half-minute stints will prove sufficiently reviving to double your productivity. Moreover, you will be allowed the luxury of wearing under-garments, gloves and goggles while being deep frozen.</p> <p>As mid-afternoon approaches, someone eventually escapes to human resources. Cue the arrival of several white-coated, and concerned looking, medics who gently escort the boss off the premises before offering everyone trauma counselling.</p> <p>Of course, if you live on planet football things will be different; very different. Indeed in that parallel universe known as the Premier League, Hull City's players must regularly submit to blood tests for stress and a Cryopod casts a science-fiction shadow over Bolton Wanderers' training ground.</p> <p>Happily for those new signings nervously eyeing the button marked \"Freezing\" on its control podium, the Cryopod was arguably Sam Allardyce's wackiest innovation and Gary Megson, his latest successor, is somewhat lukewarm about its supposed powers. At Hull however the in-so-many-other-ways-ultra-impressive Phil Brown remains deadly serious about counting players' stressed white-blood cells.</p> <p>\"If a player is under stress it can make a huge difference to his performance and we can help him deal with it,\" explained Brown. \"It's something of real benefit and will help me pick teams.\"</p> <p>But does a midfielder's blood count relate to the quality of his passing and reading of the game? Might ordering tests and analysing results be more about Brown's attempts to manage his own stress by appearing to take control of the uncontrollable? Worryingly, the game's gaffer culture dictates that managers are routinely treated as demi-gods and surrounded by yes men. </p> <p>At one time hypnosis was all the rage among the managerial fraternity and Gareth Southgate - who, rather reassuringly, is somewhat uneasy about being called \"gaffer\" by Middlesbrough's players - recalls a hypnotist visiting Crystal Palace. His attempts to convince the Selhurst Park squad, Southgate included, they were world beaters failed and practising free-kicks swiftly replaced surrendering to a trance-like state on the training ground itinerary in south London.</p> <p>Then there was Eileen Drewery, Glenn Hoddle's guru and one-time faith healer to the England squad. Who can forget Drewery's conviction that she was able to prevent opponents scoring by placing force fields around goalmouths?</p> <p>Which is not to say that the mind is any less important than a cultured left foot. I'll always remember Mick McCarthy, then Sunderland's manager, telling reporters that sports psychologists were \"a bloody waste of time\" before, minutes later, Alan Stubbs, briefly one of his defenders, walked into the same room and announced that the team \"badly needs mental strengthening\".</p> <p>It will be intriguing to see how Regina Brandao, Luiz Felipe Scolari's long-serving psychologist, assists him with Chelsea. Brandao has already been sent detailed information on Nicolas Anelka and it would be wonderful if she can somehow fully unlock this most enigmatic of strikers' glorious, yet all too often latent, talent. \"I want to change Anelka's mind,\" admits Scolari. \"I need to work inside his head.\"</p> <p>What's the betting he discovers a part of the Frenchman's brain to be still thawing out after its exposure to Bolton's Cryopod?</p>",
  "<p>They say politics and sport do not mix and, true enough, Boris Johnson is not noted for his skill at keepy-uppies. So when our capital's mayor took the Olympic flag during the handover ceremony on Sunday his performance was always bound to stir debate.</p> <p>Most of it was indignant internet comment, such as that of Margaret Barnes, the Liverpudlian who wrote to the BBC's Have Your Say internet forum to say she was \"embarrassed for the full eight minutes\".</p> <p>People were frothing at London 2012's use of (inevitably) David Beckham, a big red bus, dancers with brollies and newspapers, the reality show diva Leona Lewis and the sexagenarian guitarist Jimmy Page. By contrast there was much respect for China's sober spectacular.</p> <p>\"Lighten up,\" retorts London 2012's chief executive, Paul Deighton, who spent a total of \u00a32.5m on the Beijing party. \"We wanted to tap in to the richest vein of popular British culture and there's nothing like rock'n'roll for that. The bus was unmistakably London and when David Beckham emerged, that got the biggest cheer of the night from the Chinese.\"</p> <p>To be fair to the ceremony's creative director, Stephen Powell, it was a tough ask. Powell's Cumbrian performance-art company, Lanternhouse, was awarded the contract in May last year. Having to project London's Olympic credentials to an audience of 1.5 billion in only eight minutes was never going to be easy. To compound that, says Deighton, there was no control over the lighting or sound, or any opportunity for rehearsal. Powell will soon direct London's segment of the Paralympic handover ceremony, which, he says, continues the narrative. \"It is one story in two halves: an opportunity to remind the world what a rich, vibrant, eclectic, diverse and influential culture we have,\" he says.</p> <p>As for Boris, the locals, at least, loved him. One Johnson associate who spent the following day with him at the great wall of China reports that the mop-haired mayor was \"mobbed\" by people who wanted their picture taken with him. He later found the pictures had been printed on to T-shirts although this might, of course, say more about China's burgeoning capitalism than anything else.</p>",
  "<p>If there were any doubt that the rules of the international game have changed for good, the events of the past few days should have dispelled it. On Monday, President Bush demanded that Russia's leaders reject their parliament's appeal to recognise the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Within 24 hours, Bush had his response: President Medvedev announced Russia's recognition of the two contested Georgian enclaves. </p> <p>The Russian message was unmistakable: the outcome of the war triggered by Georgia's attack on South Ossetia on August 7 is non-negotiable - and nothing the titans of the US empire do or say is going to reverse it. After that, the British foreign secretary David Miliband's posturing yesterday in Kiev about building a \"coalition against Russian aggression\" merely looked foolish.</p> <p>That this month's events in the Caucasus signal an international turning point is no longer in question. The comparisons with August 1914 are of course ridiculous, and even the speculation about a new cold war overdone. For all the manoeuvres in the Black Sea and nuclear-backed threats, the standoff between Russia and the US is not remotely comparable to the events that led up to the first world war. Nor do the current tensions have anything like the ideological and global dimensions that shaped the 40-year confrontation between the west and the Soviet Union.</p> <p>But what is clear is that America's unipolar moment has passed - and the new world order heralded by Bush's father in the dying days of the Soviet Union in 1991 is no more. The days when one power was able to bestride the globe like a colossus, enforcing its will in every continent, challenged only by popular movements for national independence and isolated \"rogue states\", are now over. For nearly two decades, while Russia sunk into \"catastroika\" and China built an economic powerhouse, the US has exercised unprecedented and unaccountable global power, arrogating to itself and its allies the right to invade and occupy other countries, untroubled by international law or institutions, sucking ever more states into the orbit of its voracious military alliance.</p> <p>Now, pumped up with petrodollars, Russia has called a halt to this relentless expansion and demonstrated that the US writ doesn't run in every backyard. And although it has been a regional, not a global, challenge, this object lesson in the new limits of American power has already been absorbed from central Asia to Latin America. </p> <p>In Georgia itself, both Medvedev's recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia's independence and Russia's destruction of Georgian military capacity have been designed to leave no room for doubt that the issue of the enclaves' reintegration has been closed. There are certainly dangers for Russia's own territorial integrity in legitimising breakaway states. But the move will have little practical impact and is presumably partly intended to create bargaining chips for future negotiations.</p> <p>Miliband's attempt in Ukraine, meanwhile, to deny the obvious parallels with the US-orchestrated recognition of Kosovo's independence earlier this year rang particularly hollow, as did his denunciation of invasions of sovereign states and double standards. Both the west and Russia have abused the charge of \"genocide\" to try and give themselves legal cover, but Russia is surely on stronger ground over South Ossetia - where its own internationally recognised peacekeepers were directly attacked by the Georgian army - than Nato was in Kosovo in 1999, where most ethnic cleansing took place after the US-led assault began. </p> <p>There has been much talk among western politicians in recent days about Russia isolating itself from the international community. But unless that simply means North America and Europe, nothing could be further from the truth. While the US and British media have swung into full cold-war mode over the Georgia crisis, the rest of the world has seen it in a very different light. As Kishore Mahbubani, Singapore's former UN ambassador, observed in the Financial Times a few days ago, \"most of the world is bemused by western moralising on Georgia\". While the western view is that the world \"should support the underdog, Georgia, against Russia ... most support Russia against the bullying west. The gap between the western narrative and the rest of the world could not be clearer.\"</p> <p>Why that should be so isn't hard to understand. It's not only that the US and its camp followers have trampled on international law and the UN to bring death and destruction to the Middle East, Afghanistan and Pakistan. In the early 1990s, the Pentagon warned that to ensure no global rival emerged, the US would need to \"account for the interests of advanced industrial nations to discourage them from challenging our leadership\". But when it came to Russia, all that was forgotten in a fog of imperial hubris that has left the US overstretched and unable to prevent the return of a multipolar world.</p> <p>Of course, that new multipolarity can easily be overstated. Russia is a regional power and there is no imminent prospect of a serious global challenger to the US, which will remain overwhelmingly the most powerful state in the world for years to come. It can also exacerbate the risk of conflict. But only the most solipsistic western mindset can fail to grasp the necessity of a counterbalance in international relations that can restrict the freedom of any one power to impose its will on other countries unilaterally.</p> <p>One western response, championed by the Times this week, is to damn this growing challenge to US domination on the grounds that it is led by autocratic states in the shape of Russia and China. In reality, western alarm clearly has very little to do with democracy. When Russia collapsed into the US orbit under Boris Yeltsin, his bombardment of the Russian parliament and shamelessly rigged elections were treated with the greatest western understanding. </p> <p>The real gripe is not with these states' lack of accountability - Russian public opinion is in any case overwhelmingly supportive of its government's actions in Georgia - but their strategic challenge and economic rivalry. For the rest of us, a new assertiveness by Russia and other rising powers doesn't just offer some restraint on the unbridled exercise of global imperial power, it should also increase the pressure for a revival of a rules-based system of international relations. In the circumstances, that might come to seem quite appealing to whoever is elected US president.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:s.milne@theguardian.com\">s.milne@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Real revolutions can only be started by those who have the most to gain. Nonetheless, few would have predicted this lot to ever storm the metaphorical barricades. Yet in an interview that is about to come out in a US magazine, that is exactly what Kate Moss, of all unlikely revolting peasants, has done, waving her pitchfork in anger alongside several of her fellow models. </p> <p>Much - so very much - has been written about the fashion world's repulsive obsession with thinness. Noises have been made within the industry that things will change, particularly in the past few years, when so many models were suffering from serious malnutrition that it would have been just rude not to at least make a moue of sympathy. The fashion industry in this country has been particularly energetic in this regard, with various committees furrowing their brows over how to get out of this self-created vicious circle.</p> <p>But the predictable truth is that when it comes to skinny models, nothing has changed. Nothing. The belief in the industry remains that thinness is symbolic of wealth and aspiration. Thus the more luxurious the label, the thinner the models. Unfortunately, these luxurious labels tend to wield the most power in the industry because they make the most money: therefore they spend the most on advertising and so control the editors of the fashion magazines. These editors are, then, muzzled, and cannot admit that attending a fashion show these days is all too often like watching some shocking Panorama report about a war camp, with skeletal and purple-eyed eastern European women walking up and down runways aimlessly.</p> <p>Models have long been complicit in the lie that they are \"just built like that\" and eat \"like pigs\". (McDonald's is almost invariably mentioned by them at this point, though in all my years of walking past various McDonald's I have yet to see a supermodel in there.) Like the editors, they are dependent on the money from luxury brands, who still demand svelteness.</p> <p>This is changing, however. Models have always been mini-celebrities. But because the luxury industry has become so enormous, models are now responsible for luring in even more money and are paid accordingly, with the select few raking in more in a day than Twiggy was probably paid in a year during the 60s.</p> <p>But the irony is that the fashion industry may have created the monster that can, if not destroy it, then at least change it from within. Because while fashion editors have been able to say little and designers seemingly care even less, it is the models who actually might effect some changes. Recently, well-known models have finally admitted that not only were they encouraged to be skinnier than is healthy, but that they're angry about it. And the reason they are able to say such things is that their wealth and fame has given them a freedom of speech that apparently no one else in their industry has.</p> <p>In the next issue of Interview magazine, Moss admits that at times she was too thin: \"When I was doing shows ... nobody ever fed me. I didn't eat for a long time. Not on purpose ... I remember standing up in the bath one day, and there was a mirror in front of me, and I was so thin! I hated it. I never liked being that skinny.\" Hilariously, the journalist, confirming all cliches about the fashion press, interrupts: \"I didn't think you were all that skinny.\" But Moss stands admirably firm: \"I remember thinking, I don't want to be this skinny.\"</p> <p>Erin O'Connor and Karen Elson, like Moss, also started modelling as teenagers in the 90s and have also spoken out. O'Connor has been a vocal member of the Model Health Inquiry, the committee formed in the UK last year to look at the health problems suffered by models, and she has set up the Model Sanctuary, where models can get nutritional advice during London Fashion Week.</p> <p>Elson has been the most vociferous of all. In 2002, she wrote a piece in Vogue describing how photographers and designers told her when she was 18 that she \"needed to lose weight\" and she promptly \"stopped eating, [became] bulimic and [took] laxatives\". In the current issue of Vogue she is even more passionate: \"I felt like absolute shit as a teenager [when I was modelling] and all I had around me was people telling me I was right! I remember once I came back from a job in Paris and the stylist said to me, 'Have you been eating too many croissants, Karen?'\"</p> <p>Models may look like silent clothes-horses, but the fashion industry's veneration of all who are thin and beautiful has made them unexpectedly powerful figures - so powerful that they may yet force designers to pause before telling another cold and scared teenager that her developing breasts are making her look fat. Rarely has the power of celebrity been used with such irony, so unexpectedly and so well.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:hadley.freeman@theguardian.com\">hadley.freeman@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama will have to draw on all his considerable oratorical skills tonight to connect himself to those parts of the electorate that remain unconvinced by his message and unclear about what he represents.</p> <p>\"He will be addressing the single largest audience he will have at any time between now and the election, so it's important to use the event to make clear where he stands on matters that are worrying voters,\" said Ted Sorensen, John F Kennedy's chief speechwriter.</p> <p>\"Obama is the first presidential candidate who reminds me of Kennedy's eloquence and capacity to inspire. They both, despite their own special backgrounds, convey to people that they understand and listen to every American citizen.\"</p> <p>To a large degree, the success of Obama's presidential run so far has been built on his skills as a speechmaker. It was his speech to the Democratic convention four years ago, before he had even entered the Senate, that propelled him into the national spotlight.</p> <p>\"He is blessed with a richly resonant voice that we love to hear; he could read the telephone directory and it would sound good,\" said Ted Widmer, editor of an acclaimed edition of American political speeches and a former Bill Clinton speechwriter. \"He is very good at pauses and inflection, and he cuts an impressive figure on stage - all of which adds up to making an Obama speech a special event.\"</p> <p>The Kennedy link is evident within Obama's own team of speechwriters. Adam Frankel, a graduate of the London School of Economics, spent six years working with Sorensen on his memoirs - immersing himself in the process in Kennedy's oratory. Frankel is 26, as is Obama's chief speechwriter, Jon Favreau, or Favs as he is known, who used to work for John Kerry.</p> <p>A third important scribe recently joined the Obama campaign. Sarah Hurwitz was Hillary Clinton's main speechwriter during the primary season, a role she previously performed for General Wesley Clark in his 2004 bid. </p> <p>Obama is clearly surrounded by youthful talent, though what is less clear is how much he depends on it. He has told reporters that he personally began writing tonight's address while on holiday this month in Hawaii.</p> <p>But demonstrating his now well-proven ability to inspire a crowd will be only part of the challenge for Obama tonight. Crucially, he must also tiptoe his way through the sensitive issue of race. The question of how much reference he makes to his potential to make history as America's first black president is all the more loaded because today is the 45th anniversary of Martin Luther King's famous \"I have a dream\" speech in front of the Lincoln Memorial.</p> <p>\"It's a complicated calculation,\" said Randall Kennedy, a professor at Harvard law school. \"On the one hand, he can't go wrong in invoking such an iconic speech that has become part of Americana. On the other hand, the more Obama talks about race the blacker he becomes - and America still has a massive race problem.\"</p>",
  "<p>The sniper has returned to the streets of Northern Ireland in a week when republican dissidents ratcheted up their terror campaigns. Police confirmed yesterday that officers came under fire on a housing estate in Craigavon, County Armagh.</p> <p>The shooting, at about 8pm on Tuesday, followed 24 hours of disturbances in the Tullygally and Drumbeg areas of the town. Five shots were fired at a passing police patrol but no officers were injured, a police spokesman said. The officers did not fire back but were able to see a masked gunman firing a long-barrelled weapon, the spokesman added.</p> <p>Two blast bombs were also thrown at police patrols and an SDLP member of the Northern Ireland assembly, Dolores Kelly, suffered a leg injury when a gang of youths attacked her car.</p> <p>The upsurge in violence comes just weeks after the security services and Northern Ireland's chief constable, Sir Hugh Orde, warned the threat level from republicans opposed to the peace process was at its highest for nearly a decade.</p> <p>It coincides with an impending political crisis at Stormont.

  "<p>At least 17 soldiers were killed in County Down last night, hours after Earl Mountbatten and two companions died when an explosion destroyed their boat at Mullaghmore, County Sligo.</p> <p>The Provisional IRA has claimed responsibility for all the killings and said that both bombs at Warren Point - where the soldiers died - were detonated by remote control \"in similar fashion to the bomb which was set off to kill Lord Mountbatten.\"</p> <p>The IRA statement said that half a ton of explosives was used in the first blast at Warren Point and a quarter-ton in the second. They claimed that at least 30 soldiers were caught between both blasts. They said the bomb planted on Lord Mountbatten's 29-foot cruiser contained 50lb of explosive.</p> <p>The explosion which killed Lord Mountbatten, his grandson Nicholas, aged 15, and his boatman, Paul Maxwell, aged 16, happened in full view of a Garda police patrol as it followed the progress of the boat from Mullaghmore harbour yesterday morning.</p> <p>The boat was only a few hundred yards from shore when the blast occurred and it sank immediately.</p> <p>While Irish police said that they had no information on the bomb or how it was detonated, they ruled out the possibility of an accidental explosion because of the force of the blast. The Provisional IRA claim, made in Belfast, said that one of its active service units had carried out the \"execution.\" </p> <p>A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: \"The date of the funeral is provisional, taking into account the fact that a number of Lord Mountbatten's family are still gravely ill.\"</p> <p>Mountbatten, the Queen's second cousin, was questioned about his funeral arrangements before his death.</p> <p>He said in a TV interview screened last night that he wanted his funeral to be \"a happy occasion.\" He wanted the hymns to be Rudyard Kipling's Recessional, I vow to Thee My Country, Jerusalem and at least one verse from For those in Peril on the Sea.</p> <p>Eye-witnesses said that the explosion was so violent that the boat disintegrated.

  "<p>The devil's ship is the upturned crescent that the moon forms once every 15 years, and it spells impending departure or death. Sure enough, I could have fled or expired in frustration at this Iranian production by playwright Attila Pessyani. It is about four women living on an abandoned island, haunted by the death of Ismael - the brother, son and husband they had in common. The cast perform in full hijab and half-masks, even as the play conjures with ideas of female emancipation. But its yearning for freedom is stifled by a dirge-like, downbeat pitch, the muttering delivery of its actors, and a pace that makes even the 15-year cycle of the devil's ship seem whipcracking.</p> <p>It opens with a striking image. The slanting stage is covered in white sand. From under a hump of earth, a body sits suddenly upright. Enter matriarch Bibi Sanam (Fatemeh Naghavi), who returns the figure to his place of rest. Her job is to tend the grave, quell the gaiety of her younger daughters and, tonight, exorcise the Zaar - demon - from her unsettled daughter-in-law, Javaher. The play's drama, such as it is, concerns Javaher's desire to free herself from the island, from social rules, from fate, and to flee in the strange ship on the horizon, which may or may not be piloted by her lover and late husband's assassin.</p> <p>Echoes - of, say, Lorca's The House of Bernarda Alba - are the loudest feature of Pessyani's production, which is otherwise whispered by its low-key cast. Surtitles furnish the dialogue, but cannot relieve the library-like hush, which is broken only by an electro-drone soundtrack. Vocal power might have helped breathe life into the play's thin story. That job instead falls to, and is failed by, various quirks of staging. Javaher is constantly shadowed by an alter ego: her demon, perhaps, or a symbol of her divided self. Flickering film is projected on to the women but the images, and the meaning, are unclear.</p> <p>The fire in Javaher's eyes and the decision she finally makes hint at what the play might have been: how it might have twinned fierce passion for freedom with a subtle sense of what freedom can be. But the production's unvarying sombreness cools the passion and smothers the drama. So it's not just the characters who feel trapped and frustrated, it's the audience, too.</p>",
  "<p>This rock is perched on a cliff, behind which is a sheer drop of 500-600ft. I made the picture in 2004, at the southernmost point of the Cap-Vert peninsula near Dakar in Senegal, which is the westernmost point of continental Africa. It is part of a project I've been working on since 1990, to make pictures looking out to sea from all the extreme edges of the land masses around the Atlantic ocean.</p> <p>The Dakar army base is situated on the cliffs above this rock, and it's extremely hard to get to because of the high-level security. My guide had grown up in the area, however, and knew of some holes in the fortifications. So we snuck through under cover of night, with armed guards all around us. The swell of the sea in the background was so quiet that you could hear a pin drop. My guide whispered to me, \"We really have to go as soon as possible, because if we're caught, we're both in jail.\"</p> <p>When I started to look at the scene more closely, I noticed that at the base of the rock was a graffitied double arrow, almost certainly a reference point for some refugee boat, which is one of the reasons why the place was so heavily patrolled by the army. What made me extraordinarily happy about the arrow was that it was pointing to the easternmost point of South America, where I was heading next.</p> <p>I had to be quick, but I just had time to make the picture, which was a long exposure of maybe 15 minutes. Behind the rock, you can see there is a white slanting line, which is a long breaker that fell more or less regularly because of the underwater geography. It happened over and over again during the time of my exposure, so that I got a continuous but fuzzy white line. The picture is one of my favourite things in the world.

  "<p>It's the worst of times, it's the best of times to be writing a game that works just like a really well-known one. The travails of <a href=\"http://www.scrabulous.com/\">Scrabulous</a>, the Scrabble (\u00ae \u2122 \u00a9 and all that guff) playalike, have been well-documented: its meteoric rise to fame via the splendid timesink Facebook, the lawsuit by Mattel and Hasbro (which own the online rights but hadn't quite managed to get around to writing a version while Scrabulous began raking in the cash - reckoned to be thousands of dollars a month) and the diversion into a side road with Wordscraper, where you use round rather than square tiles. And Hasbro/Mattel have come up with an \"official\" version that everyone really, really hates. It's slow, it's advert-loaded, it's just corporate.</p> <p>Meanwhile, over on the iPhone - whose success as a development platform surely has Steve Jobs rubbing his hands with glee - Noah Witherspoon, the maker of a Tetris-alike game called Tris, has <a href=\"http://www.twofingerplay.blogspot.com/2008/08/over-for-now.html\">removed it,</a> under pressure from the Tetris company which - guess what - owns the rights to the real game. Tris was popular, free and fast to load. By contrast, <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/linked/2008/08/25/tris\">says John Gruber,</a> a well-versed commentator on the iPhone scene, \"the official iPhone Tetris ... costs $10 and takes 30 seconds to launch\".</p> <p>Are you seeing a pattern here? Scrabble was, once upon a time, scrabbling around to capture attention, the product of a man trying to escape the grind of the Depression; his analysis of how often letters appear in a language, and the creation of the iconic grid of squares with their scores was, in hindsight, a masterstroke. Similarly Tetris, which emerged from the CPU-constrained Soviet Union, squeezed more addictive gameplay into fewer lines of code than anyone had imagined possible before.</p> <p>But now those games are owned by big organisations which, as is typical, are hidebound by their size. Write a brisk little version of the game? Sure! But we just have to check with the marketing department first what colours we're using this year. And is the background meant to have Russian spires? Which version of the logo? Are we changing the logo? How often should it appear?</p> <p>In the meantime, small developers run rings around them. The problem those small developers have is that they can't run rings around the law; and while the courts often grind slow, they grind exceedingly small.</p> <p>The puzzle, though, is why the big companies think that their solutions are inherently better than the small developers? Lyndon Johnson, as US president, said in private of the FBI boss J Edgar Hoover - who he didn't entirely trust - that he'd rather have him in the tent pissing out than the alternative. It seems that there aren't any adept politicians in Hasbro, Mattel or Tetris; nor even EA, which could hire Witherspoon with ease and get all the benefit of his experience on the iPhone platform. (There's a suggestion that the reason this hasn't happened with Scrabulous is that the Agarwalla brothers are asking too much. In which case the lawsuit is, as I've <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/technology/2008/07/25/why_hasbro_wont_buy_scrabulous_because_its_cheaper_to_sue_it.html\">speculated on the Technology blog</a> simply a way for Hasbro and Mattel to get it cheaper.)</p> <p>Again and again we can see that it's the small developers who do the interesting things: the Wordpress blog platform, even PHP (the web scripting language on which Wordpress blogging is built), and of course those games all kicked off as one-person efforts. While we can understand that the internet makes everyone level in some ways, by making all sites equally accessible, I think there's a lesson yet unlearned - that it gives the smaller organisations (perhaps just one person) a huge advantage over the big ones. Game on, you might say.</p>",

She did what she was supposed to do, encouraging her minions to come out and vote for Barack Obama.

Hillary and Bill ranted and raved at staff, and their campaign went into panic mode after the initial Obama surge. They were not prepared and did not know what hit them. They lost control of the party to a new vision and a broadening base.

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/22/climatechange.carbonemissions?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=environment\">Gary Yohe</a> claims that I misrepresent and deliberately distort his findings. Curiously, the only example he submits is one in which I quote him correctly. </p> <p>While <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/15/carbonemissions.climatechange\">debating with Oliver Tickell</a> in these pages, I referred to Yohe's paper. I said that \"global warming will continue to be a net benefit until about 2070\". Yohe finds that this is a \"deliberate distortion of our conclusions\". However, <a href=\"http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/Files/Filer/CC08/Papers/0%20Challenge%20Papers/CP_Global_Warming_-_Yohe.pdf\">the paper he prepared for Copenhagen Consensus 2008</a> indeed shows that until about 2070, the net effect of climate change on global GDP is positive (see Figure 4.1, p25). It is \u2013 according to Yohe's own estimates \u2013 not until after 2070 that the net impact of climate change becomes negative. It is surprising that Yohe takes issue with my repetition of his own findings.</p> <p>Yohe goes on to say that I distort his message because the distribution of the benefit is not equally felt. High latitude (often rich) countries will gain disproportionately, whereas low latitude (often poor) nations will gain less or lose. This is a point I have made countless times \u2013 but was not the debate in which I engaged Tickell. To claim that I am deliberately misrepresenting a statement by reproducing Yohe's own figure is simply wrong. To claim that whenever one talks about one climate change issue (net benefits) one must also talk about another (distribution of benefits) seems feebly engineered to allow complete control over any climate debate.</p> <p>In the article that Yohe takes issue with, I described the goals and outcome of the Copenhagen Consensus 2008. The project clearly demonstrates that there are many ways to help the poor much better than by addressing climate change through mitigation. (Instead of avoiding a couple of thousand extra malaria deaths in a century through expensive CO2 cuts, maybe we should avoid a million malaria deaths now through low-cost health policies.)</p> <p>I wrote that \"the best climate solution from the top economists from the Copenhagen Consensus\" shows that \"we should focus on investing in finding cheaper low-carbon energy\". Yohe claims that this misrepresents his findings. It does not, because in this instance I am not referring to his work. Let me explain.</p> <p>Copenhagen Consensus is an effort to rank solutions between different major world problems, to identify the investments that would do the most good for the planet. Charles Krauthammer from the Washington Post has called it a \"thought Olympics\" because it makes academics from a lot of different fields compete to identify the best use of the world's scarce resources. We ask not only smart climate economists like Yohe to present their recommendations on climate, but also smart health economists to submit the smartest investments that could be made to tackle major world health issues. Eight of the world's best economists, including five Nobel Laureates, listened to all these recommendations and ranked the best investments for humanity. Unsurprisingly, the climate specialists would like to see their proposals ranked first, as would the health economists and everyone else. As in the real Olympics, not only is there a winner at the top of the podium, but there are also proposals that come in last. The proposals from Yohe came in at the bottom two places.</p> <p>However, <a href=\"http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/Files/Filer/CC08/Papers/1%20Perspective%20Papers/PP_Global_Warming_-_Green.pdf\">Professor Chris Green of McGill University</a> showed that focusing much more on energy R&amp;D, followed by eventual CO2 cuts, had a dramatically higher benefit for mankind \u2013 the estimate was three to four times better than Yohe's estimates for his solutions. This recommendation was ranked much more promising (at place 14 though by no means highest) by the Copenhagen Consensus panel. And this was the solution I was referring to. </p> <p>Yohe claims that I say reducing CO2 emissions is a waste of resources. I have repeatedly gone on record arguing for a small reduction in emissions \u2013 it is a large reduction that I believe is a waste. And this is exactly what came out of Yohe's own analysis, showing that for each dollar spent on a simple reduction in carbon emissions, we would achieve about 90 cents worth of benefits. </p> <p>After accusing me incorrectly of misquoting him, Yohe claims that I dismiss efforts to craft a global carbon cap as \"constant outbidding by frantic campaigners\". As Yohe should be aware, this quote refers to a debate with campaigners like Tickell who argue that a 4 degrees temperature rise would mean sea level rises of 70 metres and the extinction of the human race. Yohe, to his credit, makes no such claims, as he also follows the IPCC findings. </p> <p>Yohe finally states sweepingly that there is now general agreement that we need a comprehensive solution to global warming, ostensibly involving immediate cuts in CO2. He laments that I am apparently a naysayer, who is confusing this \"momentum and clarity\". Of course, there have been many political movements in history with substantial momentum and clarity, and it doesn't mean they were all smart. It is an academic's duty not to be swept up in the tide but to state the evidence.</p>",
  "<p>The Sunday Herald has a stunning story: <a href=\"http://www.sundayherald.com/news/heraldnews/display.var.2432225.0.0.php\">8 million victims in the world's biggest cyber heist</a>. Even when you can buy that many for, ooh, about \u00a3500 on eBay (or just get them sent to you from HMRC - have you had a couple of CDs in the post recently?), what's different here is that it was done, says the Herald, intentionally:</p> <blockquote> <p>A Sunday Herald investigation has discovered that late on Thursday night, a previously unknown Indian hacker successfully breached the IT defences of the Best Western Hotel group's online booking system and sold details of how to access it through an underground network operated by the Russian mafia.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>It is a move that has been dubbed the greatest cyber-heist in world history. The attack scooped up the personal details of every single customer that has booked into one of Best Western's 1312 continental hotels since 2007.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Amounting to a complete identity-theft kit, the stolen data includes a range of private information including home addresses, telephone numbers, credit card details and place of employment.</p> </blockquote> <p>(<em>Deep breathing</em> if you've ever checked into a Best Western. And it makes you wonder: why is it again that they need all those details again? Oh, yeah, a government requirement or something.)</p> <p>Best Western, however, <a href=\"http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/home/permalink/?ndmViewId=news_view&amp;newsId=20080824005028&amp;newsLang=en\">denies</a> big chunks of it, calling it \"grossly unsubstantiated\":</p> <blockquote> <p>The Sunday Herald reporter brought to our attention the possible compromise of a select portion of data at a single hotel; we investigated immediately and provided commentary. Best Western would have welcomed the opportunity to fact-check the story, which would have resulted in more accurate and credible reporting on the part of the newspaper. We have found no evidence to support the sensational claims ultimately made by the reporter and newspaper.</p> </blockquote> <p>It also says it has firewalls (yeah, nobody's ever been hacked who's got a firewall), but has this interesting detail:</p> <blockquote> <p>We collect credit card information only when it is necessary to process a guest's reservation; we restrict access to that information to only those requiring access and through the use of unique and individual, password-protected points of entry; we encrypt credit card information in our systems and databases and in any electronic transmission over public networks; and again, we delete credit card information and all other personal information upon guest departure.</p> </blockquote> <p>It's that \"delete upon departure\" bit that's interesting.</p> <p>But then it added some more: ah, apparently there was something unusual last Thursday:</p> <blockquote> <p>on August 21, 2008, three separate attempts were made via a single log-on ID to access the same data from a single hotel. The hotel in question is the 107-room Best Western Hotel am Schloss Kopenick in Berlin, Germany, where a Trojan horse virus was detected by the hotel's anti-virus software. The compromised log-in ID permitted access to reservations data for that property only. The log-in ID was immediately terminated, and the computer in question has been removed from use.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>We can also confirm that we have been able to narrow down the number of customers affected by this breach to ten. We are currently contacting those customers and offering assistance as needed.</p> </blockquote> <p>So depending on how centralised and for how long Best Western keeps customer details, between 10 and 8 million people were affected by the hack. That's what you could call a wide margin for error.</p> <p>Personally, I still think that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2007/apr/05/money.comment\">my own modest proposal</a> of a while ago stands up in these hacker- and non-wiped-disk times: simply fill the database with junk:</p> <blockquote> <p>For credit cards, I think the answer is more numbers - fake ones, to frustrate the hackers. Fill databases of valuable customer information with rubbish, to let the valuable names hide among the cruft. It's far harder to steal a usable number when only one in a hundred is real than when all of them are. The answer there isn't better, but worse quality. We can do that digitally too, you know.</p> </blockquote>",
  "<p>Barack Obama will have to draw on all his considerable oratorical skills tomorrow night to connect himself to those parts of the electorate that remain unconvinced by his message and unclear about what he represents.</p> <p>\"He will be addressing the single largest audience he will have at any time between now and the election, so it's important to use the event to make clear where he stands on matters that are worrying voters,\" said Ted Sorensen, John F Kennedy's chief speechwriter.</p> <p>\"Obama is the first presidential candidate who reminds me of Kennedy's eloquence and capacity to inspire. They both, despite their own special backgrounds, convey to people that they understand and listen to every American citizen.\"</p> <p>To a large degree, the success of Obama's presidential run so far has been built on his skills as a speechmaker. It was his speech to the Democratic convention four years ago, before he had even entered the US Senate, that propelled him into the national spotlight.</p> <p>\"He is blessed with a richly resonant voice that we love to hear; he could read the telephone directory and it would sound good,\" said Ted Widmer, editor of an acclaimed edition of American political speeches and a former Bill Clinton speechwriter. </p> <p>\"He is very good at pauses and inflection, and he cuts an impressive figure on stage - all of which adds up to making an Obama speech a special event.\"</p> <p>The Kennedy link is evident within Obama's own team of speechwriters. Adam Frankel, a graduate of the London School of Economics, spent six years working with Sorensen on his memoirs - immersing himself in the process in Kennedy's oratory. Frankel is 26, as is Obama's chief speechwriter, Jon Favreau, or Favs as he is known, who used to work for John Kerry.</p> <p>A third important scribe recently joined the Obama campaign. Sarah Hurwitz was Hillary Clinton's main speechwriter during the primary season, a role she previously performed for General Wesley Clark in his 2004 bid.</p> <p>Obama is clearly surrounded by youthful talent, though what is less clear is how much he depends on it. He has told reporters that he personally began writing tonight's address while on holiday this month in Hawaii.</p> <p>But demonstrating his now well-proven ability to inspire a crowd will be only part of the challenge for Obama tomorrow night. </p> <p>Crucially, he must also tiptoe his way through the sensitive issue of race. The question of how much reference he makes to his potential to make history as America's first black president is all the more loaded because tomorrow is the 45th anniversary of Martin Luther King's famous \"I have a dream speech\" in front of the Lincoln Memorial.</p> <p>\"It's a complicated calculation,\" said Randall Kennedy, a professor at Harvard law school. </p> <p>\"On the one hand, he can't go wrong in invoking such an iconic speech that has become part of Americana. On the other hand, the more Obama talks about race the blacker he becomes - and America still has a massive race problem.\"</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/pakistan\">Pakistan</a>'s nascent democratic movement has been subverted by selfishness and naked powerplays. Waiting for an authentic democracy to \"evolve\" remains the ultimate goal, but given the way the Taliban are systematically dismantling the country one has to wonder what is in store for this most troubled nation.</p> <p>The Taliban are so emboldened that they recently attacked the army's largest <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/22/pakistan.terrorism\">munitions plant</a> and killed 73 people. Two days earlier a suicide bomber <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/19/pakistan.terrorism\">struck a hospital</a> and killed 29 people. Most of the victims were from the family of a man whom the Taliban had murdered earlier in the day. The second biggest city in the country, Lahore, has been hit by suicide bombings in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jan/10/pakistan.allegrastratton\">January (22 killed)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/mar/12/pakistan\">March (31 killed)</a>, and August (nine killed). Recently, a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/breakingnews/International/0,,7718126,00.html\">bus bombing in Peshawar</a> killed 11. Another 10 were killed when the entire family of an Awami National Party MP \u2013 wife, children, grandparents and uncles \u2013 were <a href=\"http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&amp;item_no=237887&amp;version=1&amp;template_id=41&amp;parent_id=23\">massacred</a> by way of rockets and grenades, leaving nothing but a smouldering house. An American public television station <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/pakistan703/\">sent a reporter</a> to Taliban controlled areas and he returned with images of the bodies of old tribal leaders purposefully left in the streets to rot (against the custom of giving a proper burial to every human being). There are no legal or religious limits to Taliban terror. Last year in December they <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/dec/21/pakistan\">blew up</a> more than 50 worshippers who had gathered to celebrate the Hajj at a mosque.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jul/10/alqaida.terrorism\">Ayman al-Zawahiri</a>, the nihilist mentor of the Taliban, is egging on this murder. He came on a private television station and gave a lecture to the Pakistani people about the supposed righteousness of his monstrosities. The talk was in English because the self-styled liberator of Pakistan doesn't speak the language of the people he aims to rule.</p> <p>Over the past decade General Musharraf was supposed to check this butchery. To that end he received $10bn in US military funding; $6bn of which was unconditional. He did nothing. In 2001, he left open passageways into the NWFP for al-Qaida members escaping the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan. He was responsible for allowing infamous terror outfits like Sipah-e-Sahaba to reorganise and even hold public rallies (as long as they <a href=\"http://www.carnegieendowment.org/files/grare_pakistan_final.pdf\">changed their name [pdf: see page 14]</a>). He <a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0906/dailyUpdate.html\">signed a truce</a> with the Taliban and al-Qaida in Waziristan; one so in favour of the Taliban that they had their weapons and prisoners restored. He was also responsible for the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jul/11/pakistan.declanwalsh\">Red Mosque massacre</a> when he turned a blind eye to an extremist imam a few blocks from his own residence, all so that when he did finally use (excessive) force against the demagogue, it would distract people away from his sacking the chief justice of Pakistan. The act of killing <a href=\"http://www.chowrangi.com/nawab-akbar-bugti-killed.html\">Akbar Bugti</a>, a secular nationalist rebel in Balochistan who used to keep out the Taliban, allowed the Taliban to turn Quetta, Balochistan's capital, into their stronghold. Quetta, on the border with Iran, is where Mullah Muhammad Omar (<a href=\"http://www.afghan-web.com/bios/today/momar.html\">remember him?</a>) now lives. Meanwhile Musharraf, who was first forced to retire from the military, and then to resign from his position as president, is planning on collecting big time money on the lecture circuit. Assuredly he will make no mention of the thousands of graves his reckless neglect has created.</p> <p>The arrival of genuine democracy has not spared Pakistan a bit from terrorism. In fact, the militants have stepped up their attacks on the popularly elected government. This shows \u2013 emphatically \u2013 that the Taliban are not, and have never been, resistance fighters standing up to a dictatorship as has been their spin for the past eight years. They are cold-blooded serial killers. They will destroy any state they do not control. These days they are after Pakistan.</p> <p>The Pakistani leadership is not helping matters. The coalition government between Asif Zardari's PPP and former prime minister Nawaz Sharif's PML-N <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/26/pakistan\">has broken up</a>. </p> <p>The twin issues over which they have separated are (i) Zardari's unwillingness to restore all of the judges, including Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhary, that Musharraf deposed last year; and (ii) Zardari seeking the now vacant position of president for himself, before the Pakistani legislature has had a chance to repeal the hubristic legal powers that various dictators, including Musharraf, sneakily allotted to the post. One of these excessive presidential powers is the ability to dismantle the government under article 58(2)(b); another is the entire 17th amendment which makes the president the head of state (as opposed to the prime minister as contemplated in the original 1973 constitution).</p> <p>Zardari has his reasons for waffling on the issue of judges. Bringing back Chief Justice Chaudhary could mean that certain corruption charges against him might be revived. Not only that, but a reinstated chief justice could also do something far more detrimental to the PPP. </p> <p>In the fall of 2007 a suit was filed challenging whether Musharraf had ever possessed the authority to call for the February elections. If Musharraf didn't have the authority \u2013 and Chaudhary would likely rule that way \u2013 that could mean that the PPP's win in February could be wiped away and fresh elections could be called. Although this is not likely, Zardari isn't taking chances. </p> <p>Zardari doesn't want new elections for the simple fact that Sharif's party actually did surprisingly well in February, and in a new election, would probably do even better by bringing in the fundamentalists from Jamat-e-Islami who sat out. Thus, even though Zardari previously put his hand over the Qur'an and said he'd restore all the judges within 24 hours of forming the government, he has resisted reinstating all the judges (he's willing to reinstate some). </p> <p>In principle, Sharif is not opposed to Zardari taking on the position of president, however, he (rightly) wants the excessive presidential powers curtailed. Sharif is taking that stance for one simple reason: in his first term he was thrown out of office by a President invoking 58(2)(b). He wants to get elected prime minister for a third time and be able to stay there. Pakistan's original 1973 constitution, written by Zardari's father in law, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, envisions a powerful prime minister. Ironically, it is Sharif, who in the 1980s collaborated with Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto's murderer, General Zia ul Haq, who is now upholding that vision.</p> <p>Sharif is also in favor of restoring all the judges. That too is a bit ironic since in the 1990's his party members actually physically assaulted supreme court judges and he was connected to a scheme to depose his own Chief Justice, Sajjad Ali Shah. Having said that, right now Sharif is doing the right thing, especially as a great majority of Pakistanis want the judges restored in full. This populist position is helping Sharif and making Zardari look bad which causes the PPP man to further drag his feet.</p> <p>Each day brings a new twist in this political soap opera. Perhaps if these two leaders took the time out to count the number of Pakistanis blown to pieces in recent days by the Taliban they would be able to put aside their incestuous power-games and take some action for the safety of a broken and beaten republic.</p> <p>The history of Pakistan's dynastic civilian rulers, however, suggests such self-reflection is unlikely.</p>",
  "<p><em>Greg Palmer is in Denver blogging for the Pennsylvania blog <a href=\"http://www.keystonepolitics.com\">Keystone Politics</a></em></p> <p>Since I arrived in Denver on Friday the city has gotten more crowded by the hour. By Sunday, I walked down the 16th Ave Mall (the \"main drag\", if you will) and was struck by the sheer number of people who had materialised on the streets. I couldn't help but be curious about who these people are and why they're here.</p> <p>Many are delegates, many more are members of the press, but what really amazes me are the large throngs of pure hangers-on who possess no credentials allowing them access to the convention grounds. They come as staff members of politicians, relatives of delegates or just because they're interested in the political process. They came to Denver to see history in the making, though they won't have a very close look.</p> <p>Inside the Pepsi Center, delegates get caught up in a fever of excitement for their party and the leaders taking the stage. They cheer, wave signs and generally get excited about whoever's speaking. It's unsurprising - they are the most loyal of party activists, and it's their time to celebrate the party's platform and, more importantly, its nominee. </p> <p>Just down the street at the various bars of downtown Denver, it's a different story. While most of the people I met were liberals and Obama supporters, they're not of the same breed as the party loyalists. They're disaffected by the past eight years and by politics in general. Unlike the delegates, the convention hangers-on are both angry and proud to be outside the perimeter of the convention grounds. </p> <p>The Big Tent, a centre for bloggers and new-media types that sits just outside the convention perimeter, is a great example. I met a nurse from Denver who had purchased an entrance pass to the Big Tent in order to meet like-minded liberals and advocate for single-payer healthcare.</p> <p>Looking at me knowingly, she said, \"I'm probably the only Colorado member of the <a href=\"http://www.calnurse.org/\">California Nurses Association</a>,\" referring to the powerful lobbying group <a href=\"http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4176/is_20060316/ai_n16224305\">supporting universal healthcare</a>. Of course, talking to me was just a sideline, as she was engaged in a heated debate with a policy blogger who disagreed with her on a seemingly minor policy detail.</p> <p>\"Read the constitution! Just read the constitution!\" she yelled as I kept one eye on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/27/uselections2008.democrats20083\">Michelle Obama's speech</a> in the background.</p> <p>\"I know the constitution,\" he responded unsatisfactorily, at least to me. But for some reason that ended the debate, though similar discussions were happening around the tent and all over Denver. </p> <p>I haven't always enjoyed getting dragged into the debates, or necessarily even overhearing them, but I can't help but think they're a good sign for the high expectations we'll have of our next president.</p>",
  "<p>US and Russian warships took up positions in the Black Sea today in a risky war of nerves on opposing sides of the Georgia conflict.</p> <p>With the Russians effectively controlling Georgia's main naval base of Poti, Moscow also dispatched the Moskva missile cruiser and two smaller craft on \"peacekeeping\" duties at the port of Sukhumi on the coast of Abkhazia, the breakaway region that the Kremlin recognised as independent yesterday.</p> <p>The Americans, wary of escalating an already fraught situation, cancelled the scheduled docking in Poti of the US Coast Guard vessel, the Dallas, and instead sent it to the southern Georgian-controlled port of Batumi, 200km (124 miles) from the Russian ships, where it delivered humanitarian aid.</p> <p>\"Let's hope we don't see any direct confrontation,\" said Dmitri Peskov, the spokesman for the Russian prime minister, Vladimir Putin, as the Russians challenged the US policy of using military aircraft and ships to deliver relief supplies. </p> <p>\"The decision to deliver aid using Nato battleships is something that hardly can be explained,\" said Peskov. \"It's not a common practice.\"</p> <p>He said Russian naval forces were taking \"some measures of precaution\" around the Black Sea as the worsening dispute caused by Russia's recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia independence brought strong criticism from the key European countries most reluctant to sever relations with Russia.</p> <p>The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, spoke to President Dmitri Medvedev today, the first western leader to talk to the Kremlin since Medvedev announced the recognition of the two secessionist regions of Georgia. She made it plain she had voiced her strong disapproval to the Russian leader.</p> <p>\"I made clear above all that I would have expected that we would talk about these questions in [international] organisations before unilateral recognition happened,\" she said. \"There are several UN Security Council resolutions in which the territorial integrity of Georgia was stressed, which Russia also worked on.\"</p> <p>The French foreign minister, Bernard Kouchner, said Russia had broken international law and, along with other senior European officials, worried that Russia's decision to redraw Georgia's borders would encourage Moscow to act similarly with other former parts of the Soviet Union such as Ukraine.</p> <p>\"We cannot accept these violations of international law ... of a territory by the army of a neighboring country,\" he said.</p> <p>Germany and France, who opposed the US and Britain in April in blocking Georgian negotiations to join Nato, have been the most reluctant to punish Russia for the Georgian conflict of the past three weeks and are desperate to try to revive the Russia-Georgia peace plan mediated by the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, a fortnight ago.</p> <p>Paris and Berlin agree the unilateral recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia by Russia left the peace plan ineffectual. A summit of EU leaders in Brussels on Monday is to ponder Europe's options. </p> <p>With mounting warnings of western economic or trade sanctions against Russia, an EU official admitted that threats to block Russian membership of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) were meaningless. The push for Russian admission being driven not by Moscow but by western business interests keen to tap the large Russian market, he said.</p> <p>Peskov warned that trade sanctions against Moscow would hurt the west as much as Russia.</p> <p>He admitted that South Ossetia, a mountainous region of 70,000 people, would struggle to establish itself as an independent state, but stressed that Russia's constitution made it possible for Russia to expand.</p> <p>\"My country will extend the arm of cooperation and friendship to ease the transition period [for South Ossetia],\" he said.</p> <p>EU officials complained that Moscow was seeking to control the distribution of international relief. EU aid officials were demanding entry to the Russian controlled regions, but were being barred unless they handed over the aid to the Russian authorities for distribution.</p>",
  "<p>Although the health debate seems obsessively focussed on the National Health Service, the principal determinants of health lie outside the NHS. Poverty, housing, environment, employment, family and heredity are all potentially more significant determinants of health than the local capacity of the NHS. Sadly, the gap between richest and poorest in terms of life expectancy and infant mortality <a href=\"http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/334/7589/335-d?ck=nck\">has grown</a> in the last decade. Like the reduction of poverty, we must judge our policies by how well they reach the poorest in society, not just the average. </p> <p>Under a government obsessed with top-down targets and initiatives, why has public health dropped off the agenda? Targets for reducing health inequalities and reducing childhood obesity exist, but will be missed. The initiatives drift. Why? Because this is a government obsessed with the short term and what public health requires is a commitment to action even if the benefits accrue only over the longer term.</p> <p>If we are going to defuse the time-bomb of obesity-related ill-health, we must change the behaviour of adults today, as well as our children. Tell people that biology and the environment causes obesity and they are offered an excuse not to change their behaviour. As it is, people who see more fat people around them may themselves be more likely to gain weight. Young people who think many of their friends binge-drink are likely to do so themselves. Girls who think their peers engage in early sex are more likely to do so themselves. Peer pressure and social norms are powerful influences on behaviour and they are classic excuses. We have to take away the excuses.</p> <p>But this is not about telling people what to do. The goal of improving public health should not be a licence to lecture people, because they have no excuse not to exercise, or eat their fruit and vegetables. Nannying \u2013 at least among adults \u2013 is likely to be counter-productive. Providing information is empowering, lecturing people is not. So, no excuses, no nannying.</p> <p>For teenagers, I believe we also have to think specifically how we can deploy leadership, role models and social marketing approaches, not just to warn them about the harmful consequences of risky behaviour, but inspire them with what they can achieve by choosing healthy living. We must not constantly warn people about the negative effects of obesity \u2013 instead we must be positive \u2013 positive about the fun and benefits to be had from healthy living.</p> <p>Earlier this year, the Conservative party set out the concept of a \"<a href=\"http://www.conservatives.com/tile.do?def=campaigns.display.page&amp;obj_id=136157\">responsibility deal</a>\" \u2013 of how, instead of the constant and escalating resort to legislation and regulation and public sector intervention, we should instead enter into a non-bureaucratic partnership with the business community to tackle key challenges in society. </p> <p>Today, I propose that our second responsibility deal should be on public health. I have invited <a href=\"http://www.unilever.co.uk/ourcompany/newsandmedia/pressreleases/2006/UK_new_chairman.asp\">Dave Lewis</a>, chairman of Unilever UK, to chair a working group of business representatives, voluntary groups and experts. Together, we will invite views on these proposals and hammer out the details of the deal. Our proposals for the responsibility deal include: supporting EU plans for a mandatory <a href=\"http://www.eufic.org/article/en/health-lifestyle/food-choice/artid/Making_sense_of_Guideline_Daily_Amounts/\">GDA</a>-based front-of-pack food labelling system; industry-led reformulation initiatives and reduction of portion sizes; proportionate regulation on advertising and positive campaigns from the industry and government to promote better diets; a responsible drinking campaign matched by community action projects to address drug abuse, sexually transmitted infections and alcohol abuse, using a proportion of drinks industry advertising budgets and supported by the government; and incentives and a local structure, through business organisations, for small and medium-sized companies to improve the health of their employees, working with business organisations, <a href=\"http://www.nhsplus.nhs.uk/web/public/Default.aspx\">NHS Plus</a> and the Fitness Industry Association. </p> <p>We will empower people and local communities, and work in partnership with business, local government, communities and families to deliver on a healthy living agenda \u2013 in schools, workplaces, local clubs and through NHS services. Legislation will be a last resort. Leadership, information, incentives and empowerment will be characteristic of our approach \u2013 no nannying. We will work with all age groups, but particularly recognise how vital it is that our young people are empowered with the self-esteem to make confident decisions for themselves. They may be the right or they may be the wrong decisions. But if we get it right, as parents and as a society, increasingly they will make the right choices. We all have a choice. We can lead healthier lives. And a healthier society will be the result.</p>",
  "<p>Police and firefighters are waiting to search the gutted remains of a missing millionaire's mansion to establish whether he and his family died after it was set ablaze by arsonists.</p> <p>Christopher Foster, his wife, Jill, and their 15-year-old daughter, Kirsty, have not been seen since fire swept through their home on the Welsh borders early yesterday morning, and the house is not safe to enter to carry out a search.</p> <p>The remote three-storey building and several outhouses were all ablaze when firefighters arrived and there were unconfirmed reports that a horsebox had been parked in front of the property's electronic gates, with its tyres punctured, to make their task even harder.</p> <p>Once the fire was finally brought under control, however, and the police investigation was under way, it became clear detectives could be facing more than just an arson and missing persons case. Instead, their investigation is likely to delve deeply into a labyrinthine story of wealth, failed business ventures and, quite possibly, suspicious deaths.</p> <p>Although Osbaston House, at Maesbrook, near Oswestry, Shropshire, may not be safe to enter for some time, officers were able to search some of the outhouses around the \u00a31.2m property. There they found the remains of two of the family's horses. There was no sign of the Fosters, however, leaving questions over whether they too may have died in the blaze.</p> <p>Foster, 50, was a well-known and apparently popular figure in the area, and was thought to be a successful and wealthy businessman. He had established a number of companies which developed insulation technology for the offshore oil industry, with his wife acting as company secretary, and is said to have been a multi-millionaire before his 30th birthday. </p> <p>He drove two Porsches and an Aston Martin, enjoyed riding and educated Kirsty privately. He had moved to Maesbrook from Telford about four years ago, and neighbours described him as friendly.</p> <p>One neighbour, Gordon Richards, said: \"When I saw Chris a few days ago, he seemed happy, but he said he was feeling the pinch at work because of the credit crunch.\"</p> <p>One of Foster's main companies, Ulva Ltd, had been placed into compulsory liquidation last year. A court order was issued on November 13 for the company to be wound up.</p> <p>Foster also became embroiled in a court case in which two former business associates were accused \u2014 and acquitted \u2014 of blackmailing him into handing over \u00a3100,000. Foster had alleged that the two men had plotted to blackmail him after the collapse of a land deal in Cyprus. They accused him of making a false blackmail allegation to conceal a plot to have one of the men assaulted \u2014 a claim Foster firmly denied.</p> <p>In a separate incident, when Osbaston House was burgled in 2006, he is said to have told neighbours it was the result of a vendetta connected to his business.</p> <p>About 80 police and civilian staff at West Mercia police are now involved in the investigation, which has been codenamed Operation Feedback. As well as making inquiries into Foster's business background, officers are examining CCTV footage from around the property in the hope of identifying the arsonists. </p> <p>Detective Superintendent Jon Groves, who is leading the investigation into the fire and the family's disappearance from the area known locally as The Wood, appealed for assistance from anyone who might have seen the Fosters over the bank holiday weekend or had any information over their possible whereabouts.</p> <p>He said: \"There was a CCTV system at the property, which has been recovered by officers and will be examined over the coming days. The house, a garage and stable block and another outbuilding were severely damaged. Two horses in the stable and another in the outbuilding have been found dead. Two dogs which we believe were in a kennel block are missing. A search will be carried out of the property to establish if anybody was inside as soon as the building is deemed to be safe. Forensic investigators have been at the scene, and house to house inquiries carried out.\"</p> <p>The damage caused by the attack was so extensive that police and firefighters will not be able to search the house until it is examined by structural engineers, and either reinforced or partly demolished.</p> <p>The road leading to the property remained cordoned off tonight and a police helicopter circled overhead. A neighbour who did not wish to be named, said: \"It is very, very weird. We have not heard anything. We don't know whether they were in there or not.\"</p> <p>A police spokeswoman said officers had been in touch with relatives of the Fosters but the family still remained unaccounted for. \"Nobody knows until we can get access to the building,\" she said.</p>",
  "<p>We all need to have confidence that we can choose freely and fairly between parties and candidates in well-managed elections. The Electoral Commission's <a href=\"http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/62185/EA-report-UK-2008-08-20-CYMK-Embargoed-final-web.pdf\">report (pdf)</a> on electoral administration in the UK sets out our vision of how to make sure the interests of voters come first. For too long we have been trying to run 21st-century elections with 19th-century structures, developed in an era when elections were a relatively simple and localised matter. </p> <p>But elections have become more complex, particularly in the last 10 years. <a href=\"http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Diol1/DoItOnline/DG_4017654\">Postal voting</a> has been introduced on demand and elections happen more often, with different voting systems in place for <a href=\"http://www.dca.gov.uk/constitution/devolution/ukdev.htm\">newly created bodies</a> in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and London. The system is under severe strain.</p> <p>Arrangements for running elections vary considerably across the UK. But voters and candidates expect to get the same quality of service wherever they are. We have tried in our report to strike the right balance between consistency across the UK and responsiveness to local circumstances.</p> <p>Voters need to know that elections are clearly under the control of independent, non-partisan local returning officers. Our report argues that the role of returning officers needs to be reinforced, and that they should come together to agree how best to manage each election in the voters' interests.</p> <p>A practical first step would be the creation of electoral management boards to provide coordination, leadership and support for elections in different regions. The boards would simply consist of all the election managers in the region and the chair of each board would have a statutory power of direction over returning officers for use where necessary. These boards would cost little to establish \u2013 just the cost of ensuring good communication between the members. </p> <p>The government's role in elections \u2013 setting the legislative framework \u2013 should be kept firmly separate from the returning officers' role of running the process. Equally, the Electoral Commission's role \u2013 setting standards for elections management and monitoring performance right across the UK \u2013 should stay separate. We all need to be sure that those with the job of running elections can get on with that job in the best interests of voters. </p> <p>We also want to see simpler electoral law \u2013 35 pieces of primary legislation about elections have been passed since 1998 \u2013 and no changes to the rules in the six months before each election. </p> <p>What else? Registering to vote by household belongs to a different era. We have been calling for the introduction of individual electoral registration for a number of years. </p> <p>It is clear from our reviews of every major election since 2001 that the way elections are run needs to change. Voters deserve better.</p>",
  "<p>A man who converted replica submachine guns into lethal weapons that were later linked to some of Britain's most notorious murders was convicted of a string of firearms offences today. </p> <p>Grant Wilkinson paid \u00a355,000 in cash for 90 blank-firing Mac-10 guns, telling the dealer they would be used on the set of a new James Bond film. </p> <p>But he was operating a gun factory from two garden sheds near Reading, Berkshire \"on a commercial scale\" unprecedented in Britain, said police. </p> <p>Once converted to fire live rounds, Wilkinson sold them to members of London's criminal underworld for up to \u00a32,500 each. </p> <p>One weapon he converted was linked to the murder of Pc Sharon Beshenivsky, who was shot at the scene of a robbery in Bradford in 2005. Gangsters used another to kill 15-year-old Michael Dosunmu in Peckham, south London, who was shot in his bed after being mistaken for his brother. </p> <p>Wilkinson, 34, of no fixed abode, was convicted by a jury at Reading crown court today. </p> <p>His co-defendant Gary Lewis, 38, of Bourne End, Buckinghamshire, was cleared of all charges. Lewis had told the court he was merely Wilkinson's \"odd job man\" and was ignorant of the gun racket.</p> <p>Police said guns converted by Wilkinson were linked to 52 of the 59 Mac-related incidents in the UK since 2003, including nine murders. \"In 2004 we started having shootings with Mac-10s, whereas we had not had them before. There was a sea change,\" said Detective Chief Superintendent Gary Richardson, of Scotland Yard's Trident gun crime unit.</p> <p>Denis Burke, of the Crown Prosecution Service's complex case unit, said: \"Wilkinson established a firearms factory in a small suburb of Reading that was able to meet the demand nationally of the criminal fraternity. The firearms have since been used in all of our big cities, especially London.\" </p> <p>Police have recovered 50 of the guns and today offered a reward of up to \u00a310,000 for information leading to the recovery of the 40 that remain unaccounted for, or the arrest of anyone involved in incidents related to them. </p> <p>For three years, Wilkinson ran a sophisticated gun conversion operation from two tatty sheds in Three Mile Cross behind a derelict house called the Briars, which he rented out. </p> <p>One shed was a workshop and the other a sound-proofed testing house with a firing range. Police found costly industrial equipment used to smelt and cut metals and 27,700 spent cartridges that could be converted back into live ammunition. The factory was discovered by one of Wilkinson's tenants. </p> <p>Calling himself Grant Wilson, Wilkinson had bought the blank-firing guns from Guy Savage of Sabre Defence Industries, a registered gun dealer in Northolt, west London, who had previously supplied Bond films. His \"desperately disorganised\" behaviour aroused such suspicion that Savage secretly photographed him on his mobile phone, but police were unable to identify him. </p> <p>In his defence, Wilkinson said he was working for someone else, a man called Kevin Danaher, who was stabbed to death by an associate in May 2006. </p> <p>First produced in 1970, Mac-10s are US military weapons designed for close combat. They are popular in gangland circles for their \"bling\" value and high firing rate. Their low accuracy has earned them the nickname \"spray and pray\". Even trained firearms officers have struggled to control them. </p> <p>\"These are attractive items for those connected to organised criminal networks. If you have one of these readily available, you will be targeted by other criminals who want to take it off you,\" said Richardson.</p> <p>\"One of the integral problems with these weapons is they do not necessarily hit your intended target. They also have difficulty stopping and starting them. They go off and they are difficult to keep in single fire.\" </p> <p>Claudia Webbe, who chairs the Trident independent advisory group, said: \"We can see very clearly the devastating impact of this heinous crime, particularly and disproportionately, although not exclusively, on black communities. </p> <p>\"Here we have an armoury factory in the suburbs of Berkshire creating deadly weapons that are clearly ending up in the hands of 17-, 18-, 19-year-olds, in inner city urban London.\"</p> <p>Wilkinson was convicted of seven offences: conspiracy to convert imitation firearms; conspiracy to sell or transfer firearms; conspiracy to sell or transfer ammunition; two counts of possession of firearms with intent to endanger life; and two counts of possession of ammunition with intent to endanger life. He will be sentenced tomorrow.</p>",
  "<p>I'm not a great fan of nationalism, but it was great seeing our winning athletes on the Olympic podium. I was proud of their achievements. The only sour note came when the British national anthem was played. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_Save_the_Queen\">God Save the Queen</a>! I winced with embarrassment. Our national song is a national shame \u2013 as you can see if you read the full lyrics:</p> <blockquote> <p>God save our gracious Queen,<br>Long live our noble Queen,<br>God save the Queen:<br>Send her victorious,<br>Happy and glorious,<br>Long to reign over us:<br>God save the Queen.</p> <p>O Lord, our God, arise,<br>Scatter her enemies,<br>And make them fall.<br>Confound their politics,<br>Frustrate their knavish tricks,<br>On Thee our hopes we fix,<br>God save us all.</p> <p>Thy choicest gifts in store,<br>On her be pleased to pour;<br>Long may she reign: <br>May she defend our laws,<br>And ever give us cause<br>To sing with heart and voice<br>God save the Queen.</p> </blockquote> <p>God Save the Queen is not about the British people and our magnificent achievements in the fields of science, arts and humanitarianism. There are no noble ideals like liberty and equality. Our anthem is all about slavish deference and idolatry \u2013 the veneration of aristocratic privilege, inherited status and monarchical rule. It promotes jingoism, war, imperial conquest and the British people's subservience to God and royalty.</p> <p>Some older versions praise the <a href=\"http://www.know-britain.com/songs/national_anthem.html\">crushing of the Scots</a>. Not nice at all:</p> <blockquote> <p>Lord, grant that Marshal Wade,<br>May by thy mighty aid,<br>Victory bring.<br>May he sedition hush<br>And like a torrent rush,<br>Rebellious Scots to crush,<br>God save the King.</p> </blockquote> <p>To sing the national anthem with sincerity involves a belief in the existence of God and an acceptance that God is willing to save the Queen and the nation. It also prioritises saving the Queen over and above saving everyone else. </p> <p>Many British people do not, of course, share this religious superstition and fawning adulation of royalty. For them, the sentiments of the national anthem have no relevance. To put it bluntly: the words of God Save the Queen are out of step with modern, democratic, secular Britain. </p> <p>Recognising some of these flaws, even in the 19th century there were several attempted rewrites of the more militaristic parts, to delete such lines as \"Scatter her enemies, and make them fall\". Some versions substituted loyalty to parliament and the rule of law, and toned down the God references. The best of these versions is undoubtedly <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Edward_Hickson\">William Hickson</a>'s alternative of 1836, which, although it maintains an appeal to divine intervention, at least exalts more noble ideals than the elitism of monarchy and the gore of imperial bloodlust:</p> <blockquote> <p>May peace her power extend, <br>Foe be transformed to friend, <br>And Britain's rights depend <br>On war no more \u2026</p> <p>May just and righteous laws <br>Uphold the public cause, <br>And bless our isle: </p> <p>Home of the brave and free, <br>Thou land of liberty \u2026</p> <p>From shore to shore: <br>Lord make the nations see <br>That men should brothers be, <br>And form one family <br>The wide world o'er </p> </blockquote> <p>In 1919, following the first world war, the official \"peace version\" of God Save the Queen was approved by the privy council, but it never gained popular currency and is now largely forgotten. </p> <p>If we accept there is a problem with the current lyrics and decide to ditch God Save the Queen, what would we replace it with? Is there some other song that would make a more fitting national anthem? </p> <p>On certain sports occasions, alternatives have been used, including <a href=\"http://www.poetry-archive.com/b/jerusalem.html\">Jerusalem</a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oONWgcvPutE&amp;feature=related\">Land of Hope and Glory</a>, <a href=\"http://www.britannia.com/rulebrit.html\">Rule Britannia</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_vow_to_thee,_my_country\">I Vow to Thee, My Country</a>.</p> <p>But all these songs are also problematic, mostly because of their religious overtones, which don't sit well with a multicultural, often unbelieving, nation. </p> <p>So what, if any, song would you propose as a new national anthem? Let's have your suggestions \u2013 serious, witty or irreverent. If you don't think any existing composition is worthy, who do you think should be commissioned to write a new national anthem? What ideas or values should it embody?</p>",
  "<p>The crevasse-like furrows in Gordon Ramsay's craggy brow may appear to be etched a little more deeply today and his language even less temperate than usual. </p> <p>Still reeling from the savage attack delivered four weeks ago by his former protege, Marcus Wareing, Ramsay has now been toppled from his place as the king of the London restaurant scene by his erstwhile friend.</p> <p>According to the latest edition of the Harden's restaurant guide, P\u00e9trus \u2014 where Wareing is head chef \u2014 has overtaken Ramsay's eponymous Chelsea outpost to win the accolade of the capital's finest top-end restaurant. </p> <p>\"Marcus Wareing is emerging from Ramsay's 'shadow' as the proprietor of what is now clearly the best restaurant in London,\" said Peter Harden, the co-editor of the guide. \"It is hardly surprising than an impassioned individual concentrating on one establishment \u2014 such as Marcus Wareing \u2014 has overtaken the flagship of an ever more celebrity-driven empire where the 'name' chef is rarely present.\" </p> <p>Harden then decided to dish up the familiar accusation that the irascible Ramsay was spending more time in the boardroom than the kitchen.</p> <p>\"It is the disappointing standards at Ramsay's three most recent 'mass-market' openings which are most immediately concerning. Each of them \u2014 The Warrington, Devonshire House, and Foxtrot Oscar \u2014 is nominated in roughly one in every three of the survey reports they attract in the 'most disappointing meal of the year' category. These newcomers are so uninspired in concept and so erratic in performance that \u2014 if they were opened by independent operators \u2014 they would likely be closed within a year.\"</p> <p>Harden said there was still time for Ramsay to recover his reputation as top dog. \"What he urgently needs to do is to stop chasing media attention across the globe and to start putting some real effort into improving standards at the restaurants in his London heartland.\"</p> <p>P\u00e9trus, which is based at the Berkeley hotel in Knightsbridge, is part of the Ramsay restaurant empire \u2014 but not for long. Following their falling-out, Wareing will soon assume control of the restaurant which will be renamed Marcus Wareing at the Berkeley.</p> <p>Ramsay \u2014 whose television CV includes Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares, Hell's Kitchen (UK), Hell's Kitchen (US), The F-Word and the Extras Christmas Special \u2014 would not comment directly. </p> <p>However, his company, Gordon Ramsay Holdings, issued a statement that appeared remarkably graceful at first glance: \"We are very proud of the huge success of P\u00e9trus, which was opened by GRH in March 1999 and, as a company, we have been instrumental in continually raising its game to help it evolve into the restaurant that it is today.\"</p> <p>Fortunately, though, a soup\u00e7on of the familiar cynicism and combativeness eventually seeped through: \"GRH have taken the one and two top spots in the current Harden's guide, which is surely cause for plaudits rather than the inevitably negative spin that the guide's editors have chosen in order to generate publicity for their guide.\"</p> <p>Wareing felt rather more benign towards the guide \"I am incredibly proud to have achieved this accolade, particularly from such a respected guide as Harden's,\" he said.</p> <p>Team Ramsay begged to differ, signing off their statement with this coup de grace: \"It is our feeling that the writers of restaurant guides such as Harden's vary in their opinions from food guides such as Michelin, and it is the latter that our industry as a whole looks to as the ultimate gauge of success.\"</p> <p>The row between the two men, who were once so close that Ramsay was best man at Wareing's wedding, is thought to have erupted after the Berkeley hotel decided it wanted to work directly with Wareing after its contract with GRH expired this September.</p> <p>Whatever the cause of the disagreement, Wareing was still feeling raw at the end of July. The acrimonious split became public knowledge at the end of July when Wareing \u2014 who seems just as susceptible to macho rhetoric as Ramsay \u2014 went on the offensive, telling a food magazine he felt \"constrained, confined and trapped\" by his one-time mentor and \"wouldn't give a fuck\" if he never spoke to him again. </p> <p>\"If I never speak to that guy for the rest of my life it wouldn't bother me one bit,\" he told Waitrose Food Illustrated. \"Wouldn't give a fuck. I admire Gordon. But would I lose sleep knowing he wouldn't be there? No chance. When you wake up in the morning and look in the mirror and all you see is a man who is constrained, confined and trapped, then you've got to change.\"</p> <p>He then went on to plant a very dangerous idea in Ramsay's head: \"Put a gun to my head, shoot me, put me in a box and bury me because if you don't, I'll come back and come back. I'll never give up until I get where I want to go.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>THE FIVER: BRINGING YOU YESTERDAY'S BIG CUP NEWS TODAY!!!</strong></p> <p>Last night, the players and staff of FC Twente from Holland touched down at London Heathrow ahead of the club's officially sanctioned Uefa Non-Event at Arsenal. \"Yesh, for shure we are here to play some - ow you shay - shexy fooshball,\" announced the Dutch team's manager as he alighted the plane and walked down the jetway towards the terminal. But by the time he had got through customs and was waiting for his luggage, he had put out his jazz cheroot, thrown away his hardcore bongo mags, and totally immersed himself in London's culture to the extent that he had become immediately fluent in the local language.</p> <p>\"Gawf, kin ell, geezah, it's gawnna be ver difficult ter pull back a two-gahl deficit, innit, gertcha, but ver playahs have loadsa belief that they can compete, leave it aht, say no more, knock it on the 'ead son,\" he said to the backing rhythm of the spoons, while flogging fruit and vegetables from the luggage carousel at two pahnd the pahnd, then riding off with his squad on bicycles two by two. Meanwhile Arsenal are likely to recall the star of their one-man show, Cesc Fabregas, who has recovered from hamstring knack. \"There is a danger to be complacent,\" admitted Arsene Wenger, addressing concerns that if Arsenal's display at Fulham last weekend was anything to go by, everybody at the Emirates has totally given up the ghost, \"but there is so much at stake it would be criminal not to be focuse ... oh look! Out the window! Helicopter! Oh, me like copter!\"</p> <p>There's no Uefa Non-Event up at Anfield, though, where Liverpool are in danger of becoming the first member of the Big Four not in the Big-Four subsection Big Three to fail to make the group stages of Big Cup. Standard Liege await, and Liverpool's form this season has been so worryingly cack that even the notoriously myopic Rafa Benitez can't be bothered to hide behind the two wins and a draw they have somehow scraped so far this season. \"Where do I want us to improve? Everywhere! I want a massive improvement!\" he bellowed, spreading his arms wide and doing the jazz hands, half Usain Bolt, half Max Bygraves introducing the Big Money round on Family Fortunes. But as any four-year-old knows, I want does not get, and tonight could be a nervous one at Anfield, especially with Jamie Carragher no longer able to reach his peak-performance top speed of 3mph, and Robbie Keane having developed a curious habit of getting his Dalglish-sized buttocks in the way of every single Fernando Torres shot.</p> <p><em>Follow Bogstandard Liverpool's embarrassing 1-0 defeat at the hands of Standard Liege in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/aug/27/liverpool.standardliege1\">Scott Murray's minute-by-minute report</a>, while simultaneously following Arsenal's routine smiting of FC Twente in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/aug/27/championsleague0708.arsenal\">Paul Doyle's equally minute-by-minute report</a></em>. <br> * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"I spoke about the difficulty I had settling into Manchester - it's not how I feel now\" - Nemanja Vidic backpedals like Chris Hoy if he was pedaling backwards after an interview he gave to a Russian magazine was published in which he complained at length about the incessant rain in Manchester, the tedium of living in a hotel room and the daily grind endured by the ordinary working man in Britain.

Oh Nemanja! </p> <p>*********************</p> <p><strong>STATS MILNER FOR YOU</strong></p> <p>The way James Milner systematically fails to beat the first defender with his centres unless it is to deliver the ball nowhere near the centre at all, except perhaps distant city-centres, suggests that, whatever about dotting \"i\"s, the Newcastle winger can't cross \"t\"s. He can, however, write a transfer request and today he darn near had celebrated stoic Kevin Keegan weeping like a septic sore after submitting a formal demand to leave St James' Park forthwith. </p> <p>\"James has a three-year-contract and I don't even want to talk about losing him,\" sobbed Keegan, whose grief would baffle anyone who believed in the infallibility of statistics, as is the case with 83.78% of people. Last season Milner contributed a grand total of two assists to Newcastle - fewer than renowned creator Joey Barton - and boasted a cross completion rate of just 18.39% - worse than ace flankers Stephen Hunt, Eddie Lewis and George McCartney. Newcastle won a mere 24% of the matches in which Milner featured, compared to 44% of those in which he didn't play. </p> <p>The more pertinent facts, of course, are that Milner is only 22, will surely improve (as his man-of-the-match Milk Cup display indicated last night) and that if he left, Keegan would have only five days in which to find a replacement before the transfer window shuts. \"The club is very disappointed that James sees his football future as being away from St James' Park,\" sniffed a statement on the Newcastle website this afternoon, perhaps deepening the satisfaction of Milner, who two years ago was told by then Toon chief Glenn Roeder that he wasn't good enough to make it at Newcastle and should go to Aston Villa.

If he's recuperating in the 'Stoke during that period, the Fiver suggests he whiles away some time by going for a day's shopping in the town centre.

  "<p>You won't find too many people grumbling about the <a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/business/oil\">oil price's lurches</a> in the sleepy prairie town of Cushing. Things are looking up for the rural community where Wall Street's energy gambles are translated into reality.</p> <p>A modest settlement of 8,300 people, the Oklahoma town is home to a shabby collection of junk stores, a medium-security prison and a handful of barbecue restaurants. But these buildings are dwarfed by hundreds of vast steel storage tanks holding 46m barrels of oil \u2014 worth, at current prices, more than $5.5bn.</p> <p>An oil-themed sculpture on the country road into Cushing proclaims that the place is the \"pipeline crossroads of the world\". A spaghetti junction in the continent's network of underground oil pipes, Cushing is the official delivery point for any oil bought on Wall Street's Nymex commodities exchange.</p> <p>\"While a lot of towns have suffered some economic setbacks recently, we have not,\" Cushing's mayor, John Henckel, told the Guardian. </p> <h2>Junction city</h2> <p>An hour's drive east of Oklahoma City, the town is a point at which oil pipes from the Gulf of Mexico's ports meet lines to refineries across northern, \u00adeastern and western US, coinciding with pipelines bringing crude south from Canada's oil sands.</p> <p>\"We didn't become the crossroads of the oil industry by any great design,\" says Henckel. \"It wasn't that a bunch of guys got together and said they were going to build an oil system and put Cushing at the centre. It just evolved.\"</p> <p>When investors buy or sell oil contracts on the Nymex trading floor in New York, they are dealing in the right to \u00adcollect barrels of oil at depots in \u00adCushing. Laboratories here check the purity and metal content of crude to ensure it meets various grades such as west Texas intermediate, Oklahoma sweet or western Canadian select. Some customers ask for different crudes to be blended to a particular recipe.</p> <p>If speculators hang on to oil in the hope of a price rise, or if airlines choose to hedge against surging fuel costs, they often do so by storing oil in Cushing.</p> <p>BP has about 65 tanks in Cushing holding 10m barrels' worth of cus\u00adtomers' oil. The British company's reputation was sullied two years ago when regulators accused it of using data from its Cushing pipelines and tanks to manipulate the price of crude oil. </p> <p>But the biggest player locally is Enbridge, a Canadian firm, which has 93 tanks including vast 575,000-\u00adbarrel drums that each hold more than a small ocean-going oil tanker. New tanks are rapidly going up in the fields on \u00adCushing's outskirts.</p> <p>\"We're responding to our customers' demand for storage,\" says Bruce MacPhail, Enbridge's director of contract terminals. He cites \"more hedging, more use of contracts for risk mitigation and financial players using the market to speculate and make money\".</p> <p>Since the beginning of the decade, the amount of oil stored in Cushing has jumped by more than 50%. In the past four years, the value of the stuff has rocketed as the price of crude has tripled.</p> <h2>Mind-boggling flow</h2> <p>\"Oil is the lifeblood of Cushing,\" says Jim Perry, managing editor of the weekly Cushing Citizen. \"The storage capacity is large. Even more mind-boggling is the flow of oil in pipelines through Cushing.\"</p> <p>Such a lot of oil can cause hazards. Residents are urged to call a freephone number run collectively by the oil companies before doing any excavation in their gardens, to check whether any pipelines lie beneath. At least twice a week, engineers in light planes fly over the path of every major line to keep an eye out for construction or any activity that might burst a pipe.</p> <p>\"They say if you took a claw and turned up the ground here, it would look like a bowl of pasta,\" says Roy Maye, a safety officer at Enbridge. </p> <p>When oil prices peaked in July at $147 a barrel, Cushing's economic development director, Robert Felts, was getting cold calls from speculators fishing for information about the volume being stored by investors. \"Even if I knew, I wouldn't have told them,\" he said.</p> <p>Record prices have led to a flour\u00adishing scene in small-scale entrepreneurial drilling. Cushing sits on top of an old oilfield that was a major source of production in the early part of the last century but has been abandoned as uneconomical.</p> <p>With prices at nearly $120 a barrel, long forgotten marginal wells in \u00adbackyards and farmers' fields have suddenly become attractive. Known as \"stripper wells\", these are springing into pro\u00adduction across the south - there are 65,000 in Oklahoma alone, typically turning out fewer than 10 \u00adbarrels of oil a day. Along the highway running through Cushing, there is a small-scale oil well incongruously \u00adpositioned in the backyard of a small printing firm.</p> <p>In Cushing's high street, a few hints of prosperity are appearing between pawn shops and cheque-cashing offices. A modern Mexican restaurant, Nuevo Vallarta, has appeared. The investment chain Edward Jones has opened an impressively refurbished office.</p> <p>Nursing a drink in the town's Buckhorn bar, local resident Larry Roe said Cushing used to be a \"ghost town\" but property prices are on the up and unemployment has shrunk.</p> <p>\"Back in the 90s, when oil had gone to hell, you might have had 20 cars parked out there on Broadway,\" he says. \"Now there are four or five times that number.\"</p> <p>Rick Reiley, the town's director of downtown development, is cautiously positive: \"The last three or four years have been the first time in a number of years that things seemed to be working to our benefit as a community.\"</p> <p>He is fatalistic, however, about the cyclical nature of the business: \"We're an oil town \u2014 we've been an oil town for a hundred years. We know there are ups and downs and we try to prepare ourselves for the downs.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Dalai Lama has cancelled his upcoming international trips after complaining of exhaustion, sparking concerns for his health. </p> <p>The 73-year-old Tibetan spiritual leader has been \"experiencing some discomfort\" in the past few days and decided not to go on scheduled trips to Mexico and the Dominican Republic, his office said in a statement today.</p> <p>Thupten Samphel, spokesman for the Tibetan government-in-exile, said the Dalai Lama would travel to Mumbai for medical tests before returning to his home in Dharamsala to rest.</p> <p>Samphel added that: \"He has been going to Mumbai for regular health check ups on advice from his doctors for quite a long time.\"</p> <p>He declined to give further details of the Dalai Lama's condition.</p> <p>The winner of the 1989 Nobel Peace prize has lived in exile in of Dharamsala since 1959, when he fled Tibet after an unsuccessful uprising against China.</p> <p>Tempa Tshering, a representative of the Dalai Lama in Delhi, tried to allay health fears. \"The Dalai Lama is fine, he's just exhausted,\" he said. \"He has had a hectic schedule for the last year.\"</p> <p>China has accused the Dalai Lama of masterminding the violent uprising against its rule in the Tibetan capital, Lhasa, in March, and trying to gain full independence for the Himalayan region. He denies these allegations, and says he wants greater autonomy for Tibet only to protect its Buddhist culture.</p> <p>The Dalai Lama normally spends much of the year travelling the world to teach Buddhism and raise awareness of the plight of Tibetans. He has just returned from an 11-day trip to France.</p>",
  "<p>Suspected Muslim militants took hostage at least six people, including a mother and her four children this morning, sparking a gun battle in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, the scene of months of violent protests.</p> <p>Television pictures from Jammu city showed a fierce exchange of fire in a residential suburb, with Indian soldiers battling the gunmen holed up inside a two-story house. Two militants are believed to have been shot dead.</p> <p>Earlier the militants, wearing police uniforms, had opened fire on an army post killing a soldier. The armed men, say police, then escaped in a taxi and later shot its driver and two other civilians. They then rushed into a house and took a number of people hostage.</p> <p>\"The hostages include some women and children, and we are maintaining the highest degree of caution,\" Brigadier P Murli, an army spokesman, told Reuters news agency.</p> <p>There have been allegations that the militants had cut a fence which straddles the de facto border between Indian and Pakistani portions of Kashmir today and slipped into Indian territory from Pakistan.</p> <p>Separately in central Kashmir, two protesters were killed and more than a dozen injured when troops fired on protesters who police said defied a curfew and shouted pro-Independence slogans. The demonstrations are the biggest against Indian rule since a revolt broke out in 1989 \u00f1 and have left at least 30 dead.</p> <p>The protests, which have convulsed Indian Kashmir, have been sparked by a land row that has led to massive pro-independence demonstrations in the Muslim-majority Kashmir Valley and strikes in the Jammu region that lies at the foothills of the Himalayas.</p> <p>For the first time Hindus in Jammu and Muslims in Kashmir have found themselves at loggerheads over the issue of the transfer of 100 acres of land to a Hindu Himalayan shrine. The polarized atmosphere has seen polls showing 40% of people in Hindu-majority Jammu think Muslim-majority Kashmir valley should leave the Indian Union.</p> <p>In recent weeks, tensions over Kashmir have threatened relations between nuclear-armed neighbours India and Pakistan. India and Pakistan both claim the region in full but rule in parts. The two countries have fought two wars since 1947 over the territory, but since 2004 have engaged in a slow but broad peace process.</p> <p>India claims that Pakistan has repeatedly broken a ceasefire between the de facto border in the Himalayan region and lodged an official protest with Islamabad yesterday for helping militants to infiltrate into India. Pakistan denies the claims and instead has set up a parliamentary body to record violations of human rights in Kashmir.</p>",
  "<p>David Cameron today threw his weight behind international condemnation of Russia with a call for the suspension of European negotiations with the superpower.</p> <p>The Conservative party leader also urged the European Union to accelerate its trade talks with Georgia.</p> <p>Speaking on Sky News, Cameron explained: \"There are still Russian troops in Georgia proper and this is after they signed a peace agreement saying they would pull out all their troops.</p> <p>\"They really have behaved in a way that is quite wrong and will I believe turn out to be counterproductive.\"</p> <p>He added: \"If European countries come together and send out a tough message then I think it will be listened to. We should be sending out a very clear message of support to Georgia at this time.\"</p> <p>Asked if he thought Russia should be expelled from the G8 group of industrialised nations, Cameron said: \"I would certainly consider that.</p> <p>\"They cannot behave in a way that they invade a neighbouring country \u2013 completely against international law \u2026 and get away with it. The lesson we have to learn is that if we are weak in our response they will continue with their aggression.\"</p>",
  "<p><br>Declare independence, raise your flag ... Bj\u00f6rk champions women in the studio. Photograph: AFP/Dominic Favre</p> <p>Last week, Bj\u00f6rk posted a statement on her website called <a href=\"http://bjork.com/news/?id=854;year=2008\">Time to Put It Right</a>. In it she clarified a mistake in an article from the Icelandic newspaper <a href=\"http://www.grapevine.is/Home/\">Grapevine</a>, which attributed production of her 2001 album Vespertine to Valgeir Sigur\u2202sson.</p> <p>\"I'd like to say that he didn't write it or produce,\" read her post. \"He was a computer programmer for a third of it and a recording engineer for a third.\" While she suggests that journalists \"must start to see the difference\" between various studio roles, she also points out that there is something maddening in these seemingly casual errors: \"It feel like still today, after all these years, people cannot imagine that woman can write, arrange or produce electronic music.\" </p> <p>It's sad that a musician of Bj\u00f6rk's stature feels this way, but she has good reason. She cites MIA's problem with music website Pitchfork as an example of why it's about more than just a failure to check the facts: \"They assumed that Diplo had produced all of her Kala album without reading any credit list or nothing, it just had to be, it couldn't have been MIA herself\". MIA had reached exactly the same conclusion in an <a href=\"http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/44529-mia-confronts-the-haters\">angry interview with the site last year</a>: \"I just find it a bit upsetting and kind of insulting that I can't have any ideas on my own because I'm a female.\"</p> <p>I interviewed <a href=\"http://www.thelipster.com/articles/3455112\">Alison Goldfrapp</a> a few weeks ago, and she must be sympathetic to both Bj\u00f6rk and MIA. She remembered losing her temper with one particularly rude French journalist. \"After five minutes of talking to Will [Gregory, the other half of Goldfrapp] about knobs, he turned to me and said, 'That's a very pretty dress you have on, Alison.'\"</p> <p>It could be because female music journalists, particularly those covering the hallowed ground of beeps and beats, are less common. Female producers are rarer still. But an explosion of new talent makes me optimistic for the future. While <a href=\"http://www.thelipster.com/articles/3347399\">Santogold</a> works with other producers, she insists on total studio control (\"I had to put my foot down so many times and be an asshole\"). Closer to home, there's London's Micachu, Croydon's MC <a href=\"http://www.thelipster.com/articles/i-m-goldielocks-and-i-make-music-for-musically-educated-people-2\">GoldieLocks</a>, who freely admits that her ambition is to produce, and the laptop-assisted electro-pop of thecocknbullkid.</p> <p>It's absurd that it's been so hard to imagine these women producing their own beats and loops, just as it's ridiculous to imagine that there's some geek-boy svengali pushing the buttons. It's time to leave behind the lazy assumption that Diplo, Will Gregory, Valgeir Sigur\u2202sson or any other male producer has the controlling hand.</p>",
  "<p>Zimbabwe's president, Robert Mugabe, today effectively ditched attempts to negotiate a power-sharing agreement with the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) by declaring he was unilaterally forming a government.<br> Speaking at a lunch to mark the official opening of parliament, he said: \"We shall soon be setting up a government. The MDC does not want to come in, apparently.\"</p> <p>Any unilateral move to break the deadlocked talks between Mugabe's Zanu-PF party and the opposition is likely to infuriate the MDC leader, Morgan Tsvangirai. On Monday, opposition MPs jeered Mugabe when he went ahead with the state opening of parliament.</p> <p>The opposition spokesman Nelson Chamisa said today the MDC remained committed to power-sharing talks, but accused Mugabe of \"giving a death certificate to the talks and negotiations\".</p> <p>\"The bottom line is, he has to come to the negotiating table and negotiate with the MDC as representatives of the people of the country to find a way forward. But, unfortunately, he is a driver who is so determined to crash the vehicle. He's trying to take us into a ditch,\" Chamisa said. </p> <p>He added that if Mugabe unilaterally appointed a cabinet, opposition MPs would simply ignore any attempts it made to introduce legislation.</p> <p>Mugabe's speech, reported today in the state-owned Herald newspaper, shows he is determined to ignore his critics. The president said he was going to appoint cabinet ministers capable of managing the business of the people.</p> <p>\"I need managers. I want workers \u2014 people who take people to work. I do not want people with their own businesses. I want one business \u2014 the people's business,\" he said, to applause from dignitaries who included traditional leaders, government employees, business people and service chiefs.</p> <p>Mugabe criticised some ministers in the outgoing cabinet. \"This cabinet that I had was the worst in history. They look at themselves. They are unreliable, but not all of them,\" he said.</p> <p>\"The people are suffering and you want to exploit the poverty of the people. Let us police each other.\"</p> <p>In a revealing comment that goes some way to explain the reluctance of the South African president, Thabo Mbeki, to criticise Mugabe in public, he said he had told Mbeki that he would never speak ill of an African country in public to please the Americans and British.</p>",
  "<p>A Muslim man was found guilty of child cruelty today in a British legal first after forcing two boys to beat themselves during a centuries-old Shia religious ceremony.</p> <p>The jury at Manchester crown court found Syed Mustafa Zaidi, 44, guilty of two counts of child cruelty.</p> <p>The boys, aged 13 and 15, were forced to beat themselves with a zanjeer zani, a wooden implement with chains and blades attached, during a ceremony to commemorate the death and martyrdom of a seventh-century Shia Muslim leader.</p> <p>Zaidi, of Station Road, Eccles, Salford, also flogged himself during the ceremony at a community centre in Levenshulme, Manchester, on January 19.</p> <p>Some countries have banned self-flagellation with the zanjeer zani. It has been substituted by men beating their bare chests. In Indonesia and some other countries, young children are formally encouraged to use a smaller version of the implement.<br> Zaidi denied his actions were wrong, telling the court: \"This is a part of our religion.\"</p> <p>The boys, who cannot be named for legal reasons, admitted they wanted to beat themselves, but not under duress and not using Zaidi's zanjeer zani.</p> <p>Both boys admitted they had flogged themselves with a smaller zanjeer zani from the age of six in Pakistan.</p> <p>A 14-year-old boy, who was 13 at the time, said Zaidi told them both: \"Start doing it, start doing it\".</p> <p>The boy told the jury: \"We said 'We don't want to do it'.\"</p> <p>The boy said he saw Zaidi flogging himself with the zanjeer zani before washing his blood from it and handing it to the 15-year-old boy. He said Zaidi was \"pulling him and pushing him, 'keep doing it', telling people 'this is a sad moment and look he's not doing it'.</p> <p>\"He goes 'I don't want to do it, I don't want to do it'.</p> <p>\"He kept pressuring him, make him do the knife thing, pulling him, trying to get his T-shirt off, pulling and pushing him. He was saying 'just do it, just do it'.\"</p> <p>He said the 15-year-old boy \"swung it once or twice and said 'I don't want to do it any more'.\"</p> <p>A 20-minute film of the Ashura ceremony, broadcast on satellite television, showed Zaidi flagellating himself until his back was bloody and cut.</p> <p>Participants at the men-only event flogged themselves, while others chanted the name Husayn and beat their chests. Many cried openly.</p> <p>The Ashura ceremony takes place during Muharram, the first month of the Islamic calendar, and commemorates the death of Husayn, who is celebrated as the grandson of the Prophet Muhammad and a central figure in the Shia faith.</p> <p>Husayn was killed at the battle of Karbala alongside 72 members of his family in 680 AD. Performing the matam \u2013 self-flagellation \u2013 is meant to bring out feelings of bereavement and grief at their deaths.</p> <p>Zaidi admitted he asked the boys if they wanted to beat themselves and allowed them to use his zanjeer zani. He said the 15-year-old boy had performed a \"perfect matam\" and that it was not a \"stitching matam\" because he did not sustain heavy cuts.</p> <p>He told the jury: \"It was an emotional time and the children were happy, they asked for it. No one forced anyone.\"</p> <p>The boys had multiple lacerations to their backs, mainly superficial, with several deeper cuts.</p> <p>Zaidi, a warehouse supervisor, said: \"If I'd known this would be the result of breaking the law I would never have done it.\"</p> <p>Zaidi is to be sentenced on September 24.</p>",
  "<p>Overweight people were told today there are \"no excuses\" for being obese as the Conservative party launches a new \"responsibility\" deal on public health.</p> <p>The shadow health secretary, Andrew Lansley, used a speech to the thinktank Reform, entitled No Excuses, No Nannying, to set out proposals on how the government and business can work together to address problems caused by poor diet, alcohol abuse and lack of exercise.</p> <p>\"Tell people that biology and the environment cause obesity and they are offered the one thing we have to avoid: an excuse,\" he said. </p> <p>\"As it is, people who see more fat people around them may themselves be more likely to gain weight. Young people who think many of their friends binge-drink are likely to do so themselves. Girls who think their peers engage in early sex are more likely to do so themselves. </p> <p>\"Peer pressure and social norms are powerful influences on behaviour and they are classic excuses.\"</p> <p>Vowing to \"take away the excuses\", Lansley unveiled proposals for the party's second \"responsibility\" deal with business.</p> <p>He will ask a new working group to consider: </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> supporting EU-wide proposals for mandatory front-of-pack food labelling </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> asking the food industry to reduce portion sizes </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> a clampdown on food advertising </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> using role models and positive peer pressure to promote healthy living </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> local campaigns to promote sport, exercise and healthy lifestyles. </p> <p>He floated the idea of incentives for small businesses to improve the health of employees. \"We will take action to ensure people have the opportunities, information and incentives towards healthy living,\" Lansley said.</p> <p>The speech comes after the Tory leader, David Cameron, said last month that the poor, obese and lazy spent too much time blaming social problems for their own shortcomings.</p> <p>Insisting a Conservative government would not be a \"nannying\" state, Lansley denied that the proposals are \"about telling people what to do\".</p> <p>\"Tackling the environment should not be a licence to lecture people, because they have no excuse not to exercise, or eat their fruit and vegetables. Nannying - at least among adults - is likely to be counterproductive. Providing information is empowering, lecturing people is not. So, no excuses, no nannying.\"</p> <p>For teenagers, the party plans to deploy role models and social marketing techniques, not just to warn about the harm of \"risky behaviour\", but to offer \"positive empowerment they can achieve by choosing healthy living\".</p> <p>\"We must not constantly talk about tackling obesity and warning people about the negative consequences of obesity. Instead we must be positive - positive about the fun and benefits to be had from healthy living, trying to get rid of people's excuses for being obese by tackling the issue in a positive way.\"</p> <p>The responsibility deal on public health follows a similar initiative on producer waste announced earlier this year. The scheme is designed to encourage businesses to act in a socially responsible way and tackle issues that cannot be solved by regulation and legislation alone.</p> <p>However, business leaders criticised the scheme, saying it would cause confusion. The CBI's director general, Richard Lambert, said at the time: \"The proper role of government is to create certainty in the market and maintain a clear distinction between compulsory regulation and voluntary action. Where necessary, the government should regulate clearly and enforce the regulations strongly.</p> <p>\"There is a risk that responsibility deals would confuse this issue, by being almost a form of regulation by proxy, and would lack credibility.\"</p> <p>Afterwards, the health secretary, Alan Johnson, criticised the proposals claiming they \"lacked substance\" and would \"get us nowhere\".</p> <p>He said: \"Andrew Lansley is proposing to do nothing that isn't being done already and saying nothing that hasn't been said before. </p> <p>\"Six months after the government published its obesity strategy, Healthy Weight Healthy Lives, we get this pale shadow.</p> <p>\"This response lacks substance; it attacks the eminent scientists who drew up the Foresight report, substituting the science with the Tories' reactionary instincts.\"</p> <p>\"Seeking to tackle obesity on this thin gruel will get us nowhere.\"</p> <h2>A growing problem</h2> <p>Weight problems are estimated to cost the NHS and the wider economy as much as \u00a316bn a year, a figure that is expected to rise to \u00a350bn by the middle of the century. Nearly a quarter of men and women in England are obese, according to the Department of Health. Up to 18% cent of two- to 15-year-olds are described as obese and a further 14% as overweight. A government report last year suggested that if current eating habits and exercise trends persist, nearly 60% of men and 50% of women will be obese by 2050. A further 35% of adults will fall into the overweight category. The severely obese are likely to die on average 11 years earlier than someone with a healthy weight. <br><strong>Owen Bowcott</strong></p>",
  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> Pittsburgh, PA.<br> <strong>The lineup:</strong> Greg Gillis (samples). <br> <strong>The background:</strong> We're so hip, aren't we? So blase, so used to mashups, bootlegs and plunderphonics, that someone could splice together Donny Osmond's Puppy Love and Baha Men's Who Let The Dogs Out?, and none of us would blink. Throw ourselves under the nearest train, maybe, but not bat an eyelid.</p> <p>Five years after 2 Many DJs, here's a mixologist and sampladelicat extraordinaire who takes things to such extremes we're forced to pay attention. Greg Gillis, a 26-year-old producer with a massive record collection (some of it good, some of it tat) goes by the name of Girl Talk. Until last year, he had a day-job as a biomedical engineer but is now set to release probably the most illegal album ever: Feed The Animals, which, like everything Girl Talk has done, features 100% uncleared samples, 300 of the blighters in 50 minutes. Perhaps we shouldn't be surprised that the album will appear on Illegal Art, a label run by an untraceable unknown. <br> Not that they're likely to lock him up next to Mr Big (the 90s hair-metal supergroup) even if they did catch him. He's so highly regarded (in the US, at least) that even if one of the sampled superstars did decide to throw a wobbly and refuse him permission to sample one of their tunes, the resulting publicity would reflect so badly on them in this up-for-grabs, MPFree, post-In Rainbows world, that they would be ridiculed by people of all races and creeds. Not cool. </p> <p>He's already used snippets of Madonna, Paul McCartney, Kanye West, LL Cool J, The Police, Dexys Midnight Runners and Elvis Costello, and he's got the support of everyone from Beck and the Flaming Lips' Wayne Coyne, who nominated him for the Shortlist Music Prize, to Paris Hilton - apparently one of the many celebrities queuing up to join the synchronised dance squads that make Girl Talk's shows a cut above your average laptop-pop gig.<br> Besides, he's a bit more creative than your average mashup or \"bastard pop\" artist: KRS-One raps over the theme from The OC while Elastica jam with Ciara. Wildly disparate genres and eras are juxtaposed, from hip-hop to soft-rock, grunge to R&amp;B; all meticulously pieced together into one non-stop NOW... compilation.</p> <p>No, he doesn't just bang two records together and hope for the best. Gillis warps their pitch and speed, adds his own beats and tricks, making the songs sound dramatically different from the originals. He chops, dices and reassembles, creating what he calls \"new pop from old pop\". Probably good news for the acts who appear, uninvited, on Feed The Animals - from Deee-Lite and ? and the Mysterians, to Underworld, Procul Harum and the Jackson 5.</p> <p><strong>The buzz:</strong> \"Like 2 Many DJs speeding their nuts off, it's a veritable force for good.\"<br> <strong>The truth:</strong> It won't startle like your first exposure to 2 Many DJs, but Feed The Animals is great fun. <br> <strong>Most likely to:</strong> Make Paris Hilton dance. <br> <strong>Least likely to:</strong> Be piped as muzak at Hilton hotels.<br> <strong>What to buy:</strong> Feed The Animals is released on September 29 by Illegal Art.<br> <strong>File next to:</strong> Dangermouse, 2manyDJs, The Beachles, Dean Grey.<br> <strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/girltalk\">MySpace.com/girltalk</a><br> <strong>Tomorrow's new band:</strong> Anthony Wright.</p>",
  "<p>With Burn After Reading the Coen brothers finds room for George Clooney, Brad Pitt and John Malkovich - along with Tilda Swinton who, improbable as it may seem after all those years slogging it out for low-budget avant-gardists like Derek Jarman, Sally Potter and John Maybury, is now supping at the high table of Hollywood aristocracy. And the Coens themselves are new enough to the big leagues for them to still feel they are blinking owlishly in the spotlight.</p> <p>The film itself may be a bit of an afterthought down here on the Lido. Clocking in at a crisp 95 minutes, Burn After Reading is a tightly wound, slickly plotted spy comedy that couldn't be in bigger contrast to the Coens' last film, the bloodsoaked, brooding No Country for Old Men. Burn, in comparison, is bit of a bantamweight: fast moving, lots of attitude, and uncorking a killer punch when it can.</p> <p>Set in Washington DC, at the heart of America's political establishment, it moves in four directions at the same time. Osbourne Cox (Malkovich) is a superannunated CIA analyst who is given the push and rancorously starts writing his memoirs. A computer disc containing his alarming-sounding background material falls out of a bag in a gym locker-room, where it ends up in the gormless clutches of Chad Feldheimer (Pitt) and Linda Litzke (Frances McDormand) who run the place; their instant reaction is to try a little blackmail. The cosmetic surgery-obsessed Litzke is also scouring internet dating sites and starts something with serial adulterer Harry Pfarrer (Clooney), who has an unspecified job in the Treasury dept, but is overly proud of his past in \"PP\" (that's \"personal protection\" to the likes of us). But he is already having an affair with Cox's wife Katie (Swinton) - and it's the latter's sneaky investigation of her husband's financial resources as she gears up for a divorce that triggers the whole information-loss plot-thread.</p> <p>With such a profusion of attention-grabbing performers, it's hardly surprising that the first narrative motor - the fools-after-money trope of which the Coens appear so fond - is swiftly subordinated to backstabbing emotional shenanigans; we soon find ourselves watching a particularly murderous account of marital high-jinks among moneyed social elites. (In this regard, the Coen film it most resembles is the divorce-lawyer comedy Intolerable Cruelty.) It's also stuffed with the usual throwaway brilliancies: McDormand, for example, has a running gag with a computerised switchboard that can't recognise she is speaking English, while Swinton does a very subtle bit of eye-acting to suggest she's actually turned on by the thought of rooting through her husband's bank records. Pitt, in fact, gets the best of the funny stuff, but has by some way the least screen time of all the principal cast.</p> <p>Where does this film leave the Coens? Their unique position, as darlings of both the Hollywood set and the festival circuit, is unchanged. What they have managed to come up with here, somehow, is a light-as-fluff flipside to hardcore \"insider\" films like All the President's Men, Michael Clayton or, indeed, The Insider: it paints the powers-that-be as goofy, chaotic and definitively non-sinister. This lot, you feel, couldn't bug their way out of a paper bag. </p> <p>Burn After Reading may also go down as arguably the Coens' happiest engagement with the demands of the Hollywood A-list - but this bit of career development may also be contributing to a diminishing of their particular film-making strengths. Or perhaps they are simply evolving. The highly-wrought grotesqueries with which they made their name seem well in the past; stars find it difficult to merge with the scenery. For better or worse, their films are now more simply natural to look at and experience. Whether it will pay off again at the Oscar ceremony or box-office remains to be seen.</p>",
  "<p><br>'Yes, CJ. No, CJ'. Etc ... Leonard Rossiter as Reggie Perrin</p> <p>Depending on your perspective, reviving an old TV show is either honouring the dead or the worst kind of necrophilia. This doesn't worry the BBC who are quite comfortable with their grave robbing as they announce this week that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/aug/25/television.bbc \">Reggie Perrin</a> is to be remade with Martin Clunes in the lead role. BBC1 controller Jay Hunt has made it her personal mission to get Reggie Perrin back on the box. They're not messing about with this one.</p> <p>The announcement raises certain questions. Is reviving the show strictly necessary? The subject matter is still relevant - it likely always will be. Middle-aged men still have the life sucked out of them by hateful middle-management jobs and still behave erratically as a result. In Reggie's day you faked your suicide and started the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fH-E6J5TJTY \">Grot</a> franchise. Nowadays, you get your navel pierced and pretend to like the Gossip.</p> <p>And Reggie Perrin is still funnier than practically every sitcom out there today. If you think <a href=\" http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puvCCNe5L3Q\">Ben Harper</a> is a better example of confused midlife crisis then you may need shooting. Reggie was brilliantly drawn by David Nobbs and the supporting cast was as strong as any sitcom of its time. <a href=\" http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drlPbIWAz-E\">CJ</a>, the maniacal boss always handy with an impenetrable fortune cookie platitude; company men douchebags <a href=\" http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ajEW9kjufM\">David and Tony</a>, for whom everything was great and super; Doc Morrissey, the lecherous Sunshine Desserts physician; and Reggie's idiot hippy wine-making son-in-law Tom. And that's before we even mention a pre-Audrey Roberts <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR-FjlBga3M\">Sue Nicholls</a> as Reggie's secretary, Joan.</p> <p>So, we can happily endorse the return of Reginald Perrin, yes? Not so fast, Poindexter. Leonard Rossiter gave such a definitive performance as Reggie that Martin Clunes can't add anything and could fall well short. It's a difficult role to play with elements of tragedy, comedy, irony and arch humour that Clunes is just not equipped to carry off. It's not that Martin Clunes is a bad comic actor - he's just trying to improve on genius. And you can't. You wouldn't have Joe Pasquale taking on <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0YOaH5n2x0&amp;feature=related\">Rigsby</a> and Martin Clunes as Reggie Perrin makes about as much sense.</p> <p>It's good that creator David Nobbs will be involved in the writing (along with Men Behaving Badly creator Simon Nye), but the last misfiring attempt to revive the show (the Nobbs-scripted The Legacy of Reginald Perrin in 1996) demonstrated it's best left alone. No Leonard Rossiter means no show. If we want a contemporary work-based midlife crisis, we always have The Office reruns. In this country, we honour our dead by the twin totems of DVD and UK Gold. That's just how we roll.</p>",

  "<p>Recent years have seen a massive growth in the use of the phrase <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_industry\">\"the culture industry\"</a>. Let's imagine for a minute that it isn't just a vacuous bit of labelling on the part of politicians who need a suitably macho, hard-hitting and financially sound-sounding umbrella term for what would otherwise still be \"the arts\", but that it really intends to mean the manufacture of culture on an industrial scale. With the demise of virtually all actual industry in this country, the economy obviously needs something new. We need something we can trade in at home and that can be exported abroad.</p> <p>A new theory now rapidly gaining currency is that we are in the middle of a cultural or artistic industrial revolution. If we are to live in an economy based more on cultural production, then, put simply, more culture will need to be produced. Just as in the 1800s when previously artisanal practices such as weaving and farming became mechanised, so now it appears we are seeing a massive upsurge in the number of drama schools, creative writing courses, directing courses, MAs in all manner of associated disciplines and so on.</p> <p>Nowhere can this new mass production of culture be observed more obviously than at the Edinburgh Fringe. From morning to night endless cultural production thunders away, churning out artistic product after artistic product. And this is where the worries begin. Quite aside from the question of quality - is a factory-produced garment ever as desirable as one handmade by a skilled craftsman? - there is the problem of the workers. It is no coincidence that Marx's Kapital was inspired by the plight of those who laboured in intolerable conditions during the <a href=\"http://www.wsu.edu/~dee/ENLIGHT/INDUSTRY.HTM\">first industrial revolution</a>.</p> <p>At a fascinating panel discussion of Fringe festivals from around the world, two clear models of a Fringe emerged. Representatives from the <a href=\"http://www.praguefringe.com/ \">Prague</a> and <a href=\"http://www.montrealfringe.ca/\">Montreal Fringes</a> talked of how their artists were supported, their box office takings generously distributed and their programmes remained at least partially selective. Accompanying these apparently generous terms, however, was the admission that the Canadian contingent had actually gone so far as to regulate the word \"fringe\", and festivals not complying with their definition could be forced by law to remove the word from the title of their festivals.</p> <p>On the other hand is the familiar free-market model that dominates Edinburgh, as well as Adelaide and Brighton; anyone can perform, anyone can set up a venue and register it with the central Fringe body, and then charge performers to perform. When asked \"Does the Fringe exploit performers?\" the Edinburgh representative quite reasonably said they did not; it tries to provide services and support for the 2,088 shows that come within its compass. However, there is the greater, less easily answered, more uncomfortable question: \"Do venues exploit artists?\"</p> <p>Returning to the model of the industrial revolution, the analogies become oddly stark. In Edinburgh, a vast majority of venues are staffed by unpaid volunteers, serving the needs of performers who have actually paid to perform in return for an often derisory cut of their box office takings. As monster-venue empires spread ever more widely, they begin to resemble factories built on slave labour and exploited workers.</p> <p>The bitter irony is, the Fringe was set up in opposition to the International Festival by artists who wanted to free themselves of its constraints, hoping to create new, more radical work. Now at the International Festival, the programming is artistically leftfield, challenging, creative, and the artists are paid to perform. Meanwhile, at the Fringe, companies worry about getting enough bums on seats and frequently aim ever more broadly at the mainstream, while making enormous profits for those who run the venues.</p>",

  "<p>Chime Communications, the marketing services group run by Lord Bell, has delivered a 27.3% year-on-year increase in pre-tax profit for the first half of 2008 fuelled by its recession-resilient public relations operation.</p> <p>The company, which owns ad agency VCCP and PR firms including Bell Pottinger and Harvard, recorded an 11.4% year-on-year boost in operating income to \u00a354.5m in the first six months of 2008. Operating profits were up by 11.1% to \u00a39.1m for the period.</p> <p>Chime chairman Lord Bell, best known as Margaret Thatcher's favourite PR man in the 80s, said that the strong results were due to the company not being overly reliant on advertising income.</p> <p>Public relations, Chime's largest division, accounts for 51% of operating income.</p> <p>\"The PR sector hasn't been affected by the downturn so far,\" he said, describing it as the \"engine room\" of Chime's operation. \"People now believe they have to communicate all the time [regardless of economic conditions].\"</p> <p>Operating income in the PR division was up 15% to \u00a327.7m in the first half, with operating profit up 17% year-on-year to \u00a35.1m.</p> <p>Bell added that the acquisition of sports sponsorship agency Fast Track last year, founded in 1998 by former Olympic athletes Alan Pascoe and Jon Ridgeon along with Olympic sailor Edward Leask, also fuelled first half revenue figures.</p> <p>Advertising and marketing services, which include Fast Track, account for 42% of Chime's operating income. </p> <p>However, if advertising is stripped out separately from marketing it accounts for just 15% of overall operating income.</p> <p>Chime's advertising and marketing services division saw a massive 42% year-on-year increase in operating income to \u00a322.7m, with operating profit up 58% to \u00a33.8m, thanks to the Fast Track acquisition.</p> <p>The research operation, which accounts for the remaining 7% of operating income, was the only blight on Chime's results.</p> <p>Operating profits for the research business dropped 39% year-on-year in the first six months, with the division's operating profit margin shrinking from 20.6% in the first half of 2007 to 11.3% in 2008.</p> <p>Chime said that \"just over\" 90% of annual revenue for the year from clients had already been committed, meaning the company \"should make its full year numbers\".</p> <p>\"Our businesses have started the second half of the year well and this, together with our continued emphasis on cost control, leaves us well placed to meet our expectations for the full year,\" Bell said. \"It is widely predicted that economic growth will slow in 2009, but our strategy of diversified group of businesses will protect us.\"</p> <p><em><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857.

  "<p>A millionaire and his family are missing after their country house burned down in a suspected arson attack.<br> It is not known if Christopher and Jillian Foster and their teenage daughter Kirsty were at home when fire broke out shortly before 5am yesterday.</p> <p>Osbaston House in Maesbrook, near Oswestry, Shropshire, was so badly damaged that police and fire investigators have not yet made a full search. Fire crews took several hours to control the blaze.</p> <p>Foster is understood to have made his money developing insulation technology for oil rigs. His house is said to be worth \u00a31.2m. Friends said his finances had been affected by the credit crunch.</p> <p>West Mercia police has 80 officers and civilian staff on the case. Detective Superintendent Jon Groves, of the force's major incident unit, said: \"There was a CCTV system at the property, which has been recovered by officers and will be examined over the coming days.</p> <p>\"The house, a garage and stable block and another outbuilding were severely damaged.</p> <p>\"Two horses in the stable and another in the outbuilding have been found dead.</p> <p>\"Two dogs, which we believe were in a kennel block, are missing.

  "<p>The air over Europe in these dog days of a dreary summer is thick with talk of real and imagined takeovers in the automotive, banking and energy sectors, among others. The fall-out from the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/creditcrunch\">credit crunch</a> and the obvious risk of a full-scale recession notwithstanding, acquisition activity is on the up.</p> <p>There are at least three targets in aviation alone: Alitalia, Austrian and Iberia. Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian premier, re-elected partly on a promise to rescue the stricken national carrier, keep it in national hands and protect jobs, is behind a scheme involving a group of prominent business investors who would inject \u20ac1bn (\u00a30.8bn) into Alitalia - on top of the \u20ac300m state aid being scrutinised by the European commission. Berlusconi helped ensure that the Air France-KLM offer to take over Alitalia by buying the state's 49.9% stake collapsed.</p> <p>Alitalia, which lost a further \u20ac215m in the first quarter, is saddled with net debt of \u20ac1.1bn, an ageing fleet of aircraft, stroppy unions and creditors. The latest rescue plan, known as Piano Fenice, would enable the prominent Italian business investors to take it over and merge it with AirOne after it was broken up and its loss-making activities put into state administration (bankruptcy). This ludicrous national champion would then invite outside help from other European airlines in return for a stake. Inevitably, it is Germany's Lufthansa - which kept well away from the first rescue attempt by AF-KLM - that is seen as the most viable saviour. </p> <p>But the airline, which has already swallowed Swiss, is now trying to take over loss-making Austrian by buying the state holding's 43% and is committed to buying out BMI. A handful of other airlines, including AF-KLM, have signalled their own interest to Austrian's advisers, Merrill Lynch. Even so, Lufthansa is said to be interested in taking up to 25% of New Alitalia.</p> <p>Separately, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/britishairways\">British Airways</a>, which this month launched a transatlantic flights joint venture with American Airlines and Iberia, is in pole position to conclude a full-scale merger/takeover with Spain's national carrier. The prospect, long dangled before us, of Europe's three biggest airlines - AF-KLM, LH and BA - emerging as a trio of sole European champions of aviation outside the low-cost segment is gradually moving closer.</p> <h2>Spanish power struggles</h2> <p>The Spanish property slump, meanwhile, has enabled Gas Natural to mount its \u20ac17bn bid for Union Fenosa, the country's third largest power producer. The bid, launched late last month, was effectively secured earlier this month when a savings bank, CAM, hit by the housing crisis, agreed to sell its 5.15% stake in Fenosa to Gas Nat.</p> <p>Barcelona-based Gas Nat, a losing bidder in recent years for both of Spain's other two big utilities, Iberdrola and Endesa, is paying CAM \u20ac18.33 a share to take its agreed holding in Fenosa to above 50%. It's the same price it is paying to troubled construction group ACS for its 45% holding in Fenosa - and is committed to paying to other shareholders. These are irrevocable commitments.</p> <p>As <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/merrilllynch\">Merrill Lynch</a> said in a recent note, there is no reason why the bid should not succeed, not least because the commitments make any counter bid impossible. Under Spanish takeover law, Gas Nat, which has already acquired 9.99% of Fenosa, must launch a full takeover when its holding rises above 30% - as it will when it has secured the approval of competition authorities to acquire ACS's remaining 35.3% stake. </p> <p>Merrill's analysts see no regulatory obstacle to the bid succeeding. Gas Nat's victory would be a considerable coup for the Zapatero government, which fought tooth and nail to prevent Endesa being gobbled up by Germany's E.On and was rapped repeatedly over the knuckles by the European Union competition commissioner, Neelie Kroes, in the process. Spain will have three national champions in the power sector, although Italy's Enel has the biggest shareholding (but not outright control) of Endesa and its much-criticised takeover law will be intact.</p> <h2>Germany motors ahead</h2> <p>In Germany, the success of Schaeffler's audacious \u20ac12bn bid for car parts and tyre maker Continental has brought swollen rumours of other potential targets in the DAX-30 top companies. If a family-owned firm can buy a bigger listed group - OK, Schaeffler has agreed to limit its holding to 49.99% at most for four years - who's next to fall? </p> <p>The cause of the takeover fever is a loophole in Germany's takeover law, recently amended to deal with acting-in-concert issues. At virtually the same time as the government proposed new draft legislation to hand the cabinet a veto over foreign takeovers, notably by sovereign wealth funds, the market regulator BaFin approved the cash-settled equity swaps Schaeffler used to win control of Continental.</p> <p>With relative small fry and family-owned Porsche poised to win majority control of Volkswagen, Europe's biggest car-maker, through similar instruments, lawyers such as Robert Heym of Reed Smith see two precedents for successful takeovers without informing the capital markets and paying a hefty premium.</p> <p>So, next in the line of fire could be, analysts say, Daimler, which owns Mercedes-Benz, or BASF, the chemicals group. Both have a huge free float of shareholders - and sagging share prices. The government, frightened that a foreign predator could use swaps to win control of these or other groups, may well be forced to close the loophole. Ironically, in the case of Daimler, it may well rely on other means: the car maker's biggest shareholder is the Kuwaiti Investment Authority with 7.6%. KIA, a Daimler investor for more than 20 years, happens to be a sovereign wealth fund.</p> <h2>The lesson of Alcatel-Lucent</h2> <p>Many takeovers and mergers, of course, destroy value. A classic modern example is Alcatel-Lucent, the Franco-American telecoms equipment group worth \u20ac25bn when it was forged almost two years ago. Its now worth \u20ac9bn at most and has shed 16,500 jobs as it struggles to overcome substantial losses.</p> <p>This week, the unrepentant chairman, Serge Tchuruk, dismissed along with the chief executive, Pat Russo, in late July, gave an interview to Le Figaro in which he defended the strategy \"that has made Alcatel-Lucent a big global leader in information technologies\".</p> <p>At most Tchuruk admitted he might have underestimated the cultural difficulties in bringing the two groups together. However, expressing a sense of pride, he said: \"This difficult period is behind us now\" and \"we have solid attributes\". It's somehow reminiscent of George Simpson at GEC, an old Alcatel partner, a few years ago.</p>",
  "<p>The UK's electoral system is \"stretched to breaking point\" and unfit for the challenges of the 21st century, the electoral watchdog warned today.</p> <p><a href=\"http://image.theguardian.com/sys-files/Politics/documents/2008/08/27/ElectoralCommissionreport.pdf\">A report by the Electoral Commission (pdf)</a> calls for a simplification of the rules on running elections and a strengthening of the role of returning officers.</p> <p>The watchdog's report also renews its call for individual voter registration to counter fraud, as opposed to the present system under which the head of each household registers the names of all voters living at that address. </p> <p>The government resisted the introduction of individual voter registration in the Electoral Administration Act 2006, though it tightened up voter identifier checks for postal voting.</p> <p>The 37-page report, entitled Electoral Administration in the UK, follows the 2007 elections in Scotland, which were plagued by delays and in which more than 140,000 ballot papers were rejected. </p> <p>An independent study found mistakes at all levels and suggested voters were treated as an \"afterthought\". </p> <p>The commission said it was unlikely that the \"current fragmented arrangements for electoral administration\" would be used if the system was being designed from scratch today. </p> <p>Sam Younger, the chairman of the Electoral Commission, said: \"When we make decisions about how elections are run, we all need to think about the voter's interests above all else. Elections are the opportunity for citizens to take part in the democratic process and have their say about how we are governed and the services we receive.<br> \"The planning and running of elections need to be more robust and coordinated. We are still trying to run 21st century elections with 19th century structures, and the system is under severe strain.\"</p> <p>Other recommendations include proposals to improve funding for electoral administration, and measures to ensure changes to electoral law are finalised at least six months before any election. </p> <p>It also suggests bringing returning officers and registration officers together into regional electoral management boards to coordinate local elections. </p> <p>And the commission says its own role should be strengthened to keep checks on standards of those in charge of running elections. </p> <p>The report calls for existing laws on managing elections to be \"rationalised and consolidated\" and focused on \"clearly articulating electoral policy rather than micro-managing the delivery of elections\". </p> <p>Younger said: \"Our proposal is designed to allow local returning officers to continue to respond to local circumstances while ensuring that there is a consistently high standard of service for all electors across the UK.\"</p>",

  "<p>The BBC has denied that its editorial independence was compromised after it emerged that a Radio 4 documentary about Islamic extremism bore similarities to a programme described in a leaked Whitehall document as one at which anti-al-Qaida propaganda was put forward.</p> <p>Concerns were raised after it became apparent that extracts of the leaked document <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/26/alqaida.uksecurity\">published yesterday in the Guardian</a> had a likeness to a BBC Radio 4 Analysis programme by security correspondent Frank Gardner titled al-Qaida's Enemy Within, which was first broadcast on August 7, after the leaked propaganda dossier was compiled.</p> <p>However, the BBC was quick to deny that the editorial content of the programme was influenced in any way by the Whitehall report or that it had been fed stories.</p> <p>\"BBC programme makers and reporters decide what and how stories are reported. There is absolutely no truth in any implication that the BBC compromised editorial independence,\" a BBC News spokesman said.</p> <p>\"The programme was commissioned a long time ago. We would not be in the position of having our editorial decisions prompted by people outside the organisation.\"</p> <p>Yesterday's Guardian splash, by home affairs editor Alan Travis, quoted a leaked document from a Whitehall counter terrorism unit established under former home secretary John Reid, called the research, information and communication unit.</p> <p>This document claimed the unit was targeting the BBC and other media organisations through which it could \"channel messages\" as part of a propaganda push designed to \"taint the al-Qaida brand\".</p> <p>The report, called Challenging Violent Extremist Ideology Through Communications and dated July 31, said: \"We are pushing this material to UK media channels, eg a BBC radio programme exposing tensions between AQ leadership and supporters. And a restricted working group will communicate niche messages through media and non-media.\"</p> <p>RICU guidance said the propaganda was primarily aimed at \"overseas communicators\" in embassies and consulates around the world, but could be used in Britain as well.</p> <p>The campaign, reported the Guardian, is based on the premise that al-Qaida is waning worldwide and can appear vulnerable on issues such as declining popularity, rejection by key credible figures and the emergence of details of atrocities.</p> <p>The Radio 4 Analysis programme looked at how former allies of, and inspirational clerical figures to, Osama bin Laden were now working to turn Islamist sentiment against al-Qaida, concluding with one expert saying that the organisation had no clear future. </p> <p>Another suggested in the Radio 4 documentary that al-Qaida did not have any future outside Afghanistan but could still make violent attacks against the west, given the opportunity.</p> <p>Alongside contributions and assessments from other Islamic scholars and men formerly involved in jihadist organisations, the Analysis show highlighted the work of Saudi scholar Sheikh Salman Al-Oudah and a man called Said Imam.</p> <p>The leaked RICU report similarly highlights condemnation of al-Qaida by these two men.</p> <p>During the programme, Gardner said: \"Said Imam, also known as Dr Fadl, is seen as the Godfather of jihadi thought. </p> <p>\"Al-Qaida's leadership drew on his edicts for years. But last November, he published a devastating treatise that drew on Islamic law and jurisprudence to argue that resorting to violence is banned and so was rebelling against a Muslim ruler. He writes to young Muslims, urging them to turn away from al-Qaida's recruiters.\"</p> <p>The BBC News spokesman said the Analysis programme on al-Qaida and its supporters around the world showed that it was an interesting and newsworthy topic. </p> <p>He also noted that the Analysis programme contained additional information and a broader look at the topic not alluded to in the RICU document extracts published in the Guardian.</p> <p>The BBC programme made the distinction between \"two tectonic plates\": an intellectual strand within the jihadi movement questioning al-Qaida; and a grassroots movement, which it identified as moving the other way, with growing numbers of potential recruits to violent jihad, including in Britain.</p> <p>A Home Office spokeswoman said it did not comment on leaked documents.

  "<p>My sister has worn a <a href=\"http://www.muhajabah.com/faceveil.htm\">face veil</a> for six years. She lives in Birmingham, where it is common to see women shrouded in black, however the sight is more unusual in Southampton, where my parents live and where, at the weekend, my sister was called \"a ninja woman\". </p> <p>This insult is neither the most hurtful \u2013 \"fucking terrorist freak\" \u2013 nor the most spurious \u2013 \"Osama-lover\" \u2013 to have been levelled at her over the years. But it wasn't the name-calling that really rankled her and me.</p> <p>We challenged the man who made the remark, he denied saying it, even though he said it as I was passing him. My sister called him \"a lying bigot\", which is all she could muster on a Sunday afternoon in Primark, en route to Clark's to have her children fitted for new shoes, but she delivered it rather splendidly, to the bemusement of shoppers who, if they hadn't noticed her before, suddenly found her rather interesting. Her children asked why mummy was shouting at a man.</p> <p>She left Primark in a foul mood, and sitting in Clark's with three children who kept complaining about being bored/tired/hungry was not the best way for her to calm down. Later, rushing to the car to avoid a parking ticket, she told me she could handle the stares and the insults but not the lies. She always made a point, she said, of walking up to people and asking them why they had called her names. The response was either silence or denial. Perhaps they were surprised she could speak English or even hear them through the cloth. She said:</p> <blockquote> <p>People never say things to your face, they always say them once they think you're out of earshot. That's what gets me. When you bring them up on it, they deny saying anything or they look in the other direction. Men are the worst.</p> </blockquote> <p>My sister wears a face veil because it is something she wants to do. She knows not all Muslim women feel the same and she is not on a mission to force others to adopt the same dress code as her. She is not breaking the law. She is, as she sees it, minding her own business, being a mother and bringing up her children. My question is: the next time someone calls her a name, how should she respond?</p>",
  "<p>Peter K Austin has published 11 books on minority and endangered languages, including 12 Australian Aboriginal languages, and holds the M\u00e4rit Rausing Chair in field linguistics at the School of Oriental and African Studies where he is also director of the Endangered Languages Academic Programme. His most recent book is 1000 Languages: The Worldwide History of Living and Lost Tongues, which explores the state of languages around the world.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780500514115\">Buy 1000 Languages from the Guardian bookshop</a></p> <p>There are more than 6,900 languages used around the world today, ranging in size from those with hundreds of millions of speakers to those with only one or two. Language experts now estimate that as many as half of the existing languages are endangered, and by the year 2050 they will be extinct. The major reason for this language loss is that communities are switching to larger politically and economically more powerful languages, like English, Spanish, Hindi or Swahili.</p> <p>Each language expresses the history, culture, society and identity of the people who speak it, and each is a unique way of talking about the world. The loss of any language is a loss to both the community who use it in their daily lives, and to humankind in general. The songs, stories, words, expressions and grammatical structures of languages developed over countless generations are part of the intangible heritage of all humanity.</p> <p>So how to choose a top 10 from more than 3,000 endangered languages? My selection is a personal one that tries to take into account four factors: (1) geographical coverage - if possible I wanted at least one language from each continent; (2) scientific interest - I wanted to include languages that linguists find interesting and important, because of their structural or historical significance; (3) cultural interest - if possible some information about interesting cultural and political aspects of endangered languages should be included; and (4) social impact - I wanted to include one or more situations showing why languages are endangered, as well as highlighting some of the ways communities are responding to the threat they currently face.</p> <h2>1. Jeru</h2> <p>Jeru (or Great Andamanese) is spoken by fewer than 20 people on the Andaman Islands in the Indian Ocean. It is generally believed that Andamanese languages might be the last surviving languages whose history goes back to pre-Neolithic times in Southeast Asia and possibly the first settlement of the region by modern humans moving out of Africa. The languages of the Andamans cannot be shown to be related to any other languages spoken on earth.</p> <h2>2. N|u (also called Khomani) </h2> <p>This is a Khoisan language spoken by fewer than 10 elderly people whose traditional lands are located in the Kalahari Gemsbok National Park in South Africa. The Khoisan languages are remarkable for having click sounds \u2013 the | symbol is pronounced like the English interjection tsk! tsk! used to express pity or shame.The closest relative of N|u is !X\u00f3\u00f5 (also called Ta'a and spoken by about 4,000 people) which has the most sounds of any language on earth: 74 consonants, 31 vowels, and four tones (voice pitches).</p> <h2>3. Ainu</h2> <p>The Ainu language is spoken by a small number of old people on the island of Hokkaido in the far north of Japan. They are the original inhabitants of Japan, but were not recognised as a minority group by the Japanese government until this year. The language has very complicated verbs that incorporate a whole sentence's worth of meanings, and it is the vehicle of an extensive oral literature of folk stories and songs. Moves are underway to revive Ainu language and cultural practices.</p> <h2>4. Thao</h2> <p>Sun Moon Lake of central Taiwan is the home of the Thao language, now spoken by a handful of old people while the remainder of the community speaks Taiwanese Chinese (Minnan). Thao is an Austronesian language related to languages spoken in the Philippines, Indonesia and the Pacific, and represents one of the original communities of the Austronesians before they sailed south and east over 3,000 years ago.</p> <h2>5. Yuchi</h2> <p>Yuchi is spoken in Oklahoma, USA, by just five people all aged over 75. Yuchi is an isolate language (that is, it cannot be shown to be related to any other language spoken on earth). Their own name for themselves is Tsoyaha, meaning \"Children of the Sun\". Yuchi nouns have 10 genders, indicated by word endings: six for Yuchi people (depending on kinship relations to the person speaking), one for non-Yuchis and animals, and three for inanimate objects (horizontal, vertical, and round). Efforts are now under way to document the language with sound and video recordings, and to revitalise it by teaching it to children.</p> <h2>6. Oro Win</h2> <p>The Oro Win live in western Rondonia State, Brazil, and were first contacted by outsiders in 1963 on the headwaters of the Pacaas Novos River. The group was almost exterminated after two attacks by outsiders and today numbers just 50 people, only five of whom still speak the language. Oro Win is one of only five languages known to make regular use of a sound that linguists call \"a voiceless dental bilabially trilled affricate\". In rather plainer language, this means it's produced with the tip of the tongue placed between the lips which are then vibrated (in a similar way to the <em>brrr </em>sound we make in English to signal that the weather is cold).</p> <h2>7. Kusunda</h2> <p>The Kusunda are a former group of hunter-gatherers from western Nepal who have intermarried with their settled neighbours. Until recently it was thought that the language was extinct but in 2004 scholars at Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu located eight people who still speak the language. Another isolate, with no connections to other languages.</p> <h2>8. Ter Sami</h2> <p>This is the easternmost of the Saami group of languages (formerly called Lapp, a derogatory term), located on the Kola Peninsula in Russia. It is spoken by just 10 elderly people among approximately 100 ethnic Ter Sami who all now speak Russian as their daily language. Ter Sami is related to Finnish and other Uralic languages spoken in Russia and Siberia, and distantly to Hungarian.</p> <h2>9. Guugu Yimidhirr</h2> <p>Guugu Yimidhirr is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken at Hopevale near Cooktown in northern Queensland by around 200 people. A wordlist was collected by Captain James Cook in 1770 and it has given English (and the rest of the world's languages) the word kangaroo. Guugu Yimidhirr (like some other Aboriginal languages) is remarkable for having a special way of speaking to certain family members (like a man's father-in-law or brother-in-law) in which everyday words are replaced by completely different special vocabulary. For example, instead of saying <em>bama dhaday</em> for \"the man is going\" you must say <em>yambaal bali </em>when speaking to these relatives as a mark of respect and politeness.</p> <h2>10. Ket</h2> <p>Ket is the last surviving member of a family of languages spoken along the Yenesei River in eastern Siberia. Today there are around 600 speakers but no children are learning it since parents prefer to speak to them in Russian. Ket is the only Siberian language with a tone system where the pitch of the voice can give what sound like identical words quite different meanings. (Much like Chinese or Yoruba). To add to the difficulty for any westerner wishing to learn it, it also has extremely complicated word structure and grammar.</p>",

Then down the other end Liege should have scored, De Carmago and Mbokani getting in each other's way when both players were free six yards out, the former swishing at fresh air. That is terrible defending from the home side. Then seconds later Reina is forced to palm wide from a Mbokani header. Liverpool are rocking here.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>20 min:</strong> The crowd are beginning to get slightly agitated as Liverpool resort to the long ball in the general direction of Torres. And no wonder: the fancy patterns of Torres, Keane and Benayoun during the first few minutes looked like they could bear fruit.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>23 min:</strong> Keane's down near the right corner flag, showcasing the sort of quick-feet shuffle that would be accompanied by a xylophone trill in the cartoons. He's got three men surrounding him, but somehow manages to dig the ball out and whip a brilliant cross into the area. Only Torres is there. Liverpool are suddenly playing with a smidgen of fear. Can they shake it off?</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>27 min:</strong> That is better from Liverpool, Aurelio one-twoing with Benayoun - by far Liverpool's most lively player so far - to romp into space. His final ball is dismal, sailing into the Kop, but at least Liverpool are trying to knock it around again in areas where they were earlier having some joy.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>32 min:</strong> Skrtel and Mbokani brush against each other then start wafting their hands in each other's faces. It's a whole load of nothing but the ref fixes them both with a funny stare from distance.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>35 min:</strong> Keane is being forced to drop back to the centre circle to see the ball. He attempts to ping a clever pass forward, but Torres is the only man there and surrounded by Liege defenders. The ball is predictably lost, allowing Mbokani to break up the left wing. He skips over a wild Skrtel challenge, then races past Carragher, who is lucky to escape a booking for a saucy pull on the back of the striker's shorts. The free kick, swung into the box by Witsel, is easily claimed by Reina, the only Liverpool player who has been consistently good in both ties.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>38 min:</strong> Witsel slides in to deny Benayoun a shooting chance in the box. It's a good challenge, though the ball does brush off his hand. Liverpool sort of claim a penalty, but their hearts are not really in it. \"Is it my imagination, or is Unibet advertising bets on Liverpool v Middlesbrough?\" notes Jonathan Denness. \"Has anyone checked the odds on 2-1 Liverpool?\"</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>40 min:</strong> From a corner, Kuyt heads wide, high and left. It's not a particularly good effort... but it's the best Liverpool have managed so far. The confidence has quickly drained from the hosts; they started beautifully and are now reduced to witless lumping. Only Benayoun and Keane are making any efforts to play the ball on the ground; everyone else simply pings it in the general direction of Torres and hopes for some magic. Sometimes, having the best striker in Europe in your team can be a curse as well as a blessing.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>45 min 02 secs, and it's HALF TIME: Liverpool 0-0 Standard Liege.</strong> Without an on-fire Pepe Reina, Liverpool would already be out of Europe after the first 135 minutes (and two seconds) of this tie. They have 15 minutes to paint on their gamefaces, and another 45 to execute the plan. With the quality in Liverpool's ranks they should be ahead - if not walking it, for Liege are more than decent - but the side is extremely disjointed. A shock is certainly not beyond the realms of possibility here. Actually, the way they've started the season, would it be a shock? \"Are Gerrard and Alonso playing?\" asks Brent L Docker. \"I saw them in your team sheet but not seen them mentioned since.\" I can assure you they are both playing, and have even kicked the ball once or twice each.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>Half-time soul searching dept.</strong> \"Is Alonso even playing or Gerrard, come to that? Didn't see their names much and these two should be running the show,\" writes Paul McDevitt. \"Need to bring on Babel for Kuyt. Someone who won't be afraid to run at them a bit.\" Niall Mullin is less circumspect: \"Who do you think is having the worst game here? Torben Skrtel, Hollywood Stevie or Dirk 'Seriously what pictures has he got of you Rafa?' Kuyt? These are giving a shower a bad name. I'm almost pining for Biscan, Cheyrou and Pongolle.\" Hey, Flo-Po looked a decent striker to me, and Biscan put in his shift during the 2005 Champions League run. But Cheyrou? Are you <em>seriously</em> pining for Cheyrou? Has it really come to this?</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>And we're off again.</strong> No change for Liverpool. Something's got to change, though. <em>Something</em> has.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>46 min:</strong> Torres is mugged about four times by Onyewu as he sails down the right. Eventually, after getting a hand in the face, he wins a free kick (which is basically a corner, so don't hold your breath).</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>47 min:</strong> Aurelio takes. Yep.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>48 min:</strong> Torres now tears down the left like a maniac to win a throw deep in Liege territory. He had absolutely no right to win that ball, a fantastic run. From Aurelio's throw he nearly manages to bring the ball down and attempt a looping volley from the left-hand side of the box into the bottom right, but his shot is blocked the second it leaves his boot. Again, Liverpool have started the half brightly. Can they keep it up this time?</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>51 min:</strong> Defour exchanges passes with Fellaini in the centre and tries to hit one with the outside of his boot into the top right corner from 30 yards. Very ambitious, and nowhere near Reina's net. Just before he hit the ball, though, Anfield took a collective sharp intake of breath, in realisation that just one screamer will put their side in a lot of trouble.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>52 min:</strong> Gerrard has a wild flay from 30 yards. Dear me, that one will have ended up in Stanley Park, or perhaps Goodison. Slight shades of desperation; there is still well over half an hour to go.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>54 min:</strong> Standard Liege are playing at a frighteningly high tempo. This is a very impressive display by the Belgian side. Kuyt is pressured into letting the ball clank off his shin by Witsel and Dante, though it doesn't take much, does it.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>57 min:</strong> Now Alonso shanks a simple pass towards Kuyt into touch. The players were only a few yards away from each other. What on earth has happened to Alonso? His form in 2004/05 was majestic, he was as good a passer as the Premier League has seen. And now this. Very strange.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>59 min:</strong> A couple of scrappy minutes as Torres slides in on Sarr and Skrtel falls on De Camargo. Both times the visiting player comes off worse, both times there was no intent from the Liverpool man. Everyone gets up and gets on with it, though, playing nicely.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>60 min:</strong> Playing nicely? Er... Sarr flies in late on Torres, flipping the striker into the air like an egg, and picks up a yellow. Babel comes on for Benayoun.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>61 min:</strong> The first real dangerous Liverpudlian move of the night, and it is, of course, all down to Torres, who picks the ball up on the right, cuts across the front of the area and nearly gets his shot in, Camozzato blocking well. Babel was in acres on the left and perhaps should have been fed, but what are you gonna do? \"Forget mentions of Gerrard and Alonso,\" writes Ravi Haranand. \"It's been almost an hour and I haven't seen Gary Naylor yet. Is he OK? Has someone been round to check on him?\"</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>Don't worry, Ravi, here's Naylor, and he's been rubbing away furiously at his crystal ball:</strong> \"Experience is so critical in Champions League football because CL matches are won by teams that win the crucial moments. Liverpool's defence have done that so far; the attack will win one soon and they'll be through (I regret to say).\"</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>66 min:</strong> Liverpool have gone very quiet, and again it's with the long balls. This is an increasingly nervous display. \"What's happened to Alonso?\" asks Dominic Kelly. \"Maybe he's unsettled by the fact that his manager has openly been trying to sell him off in order to buy a player not as good as him.\" Fair point well made, though it doesn't explain his decline over the last couple of seasons. It's genuinely perplexing, though admittedly I am simple folk.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>68 min:</strong> Well, Alonso has been poor all evening, but he's just taken Liverpool's first serious shot on target. Keane dummies the ball to Kuyt on the right-hand side of the box. For a minute it looks as though the chance of a shot will open up, but the striker-cum-winger miscontrols off his shin (again!) and the ball eventually breaks to Alonso, who tries to rescue the situation with a powerful sidefoot from the edge of the area. Not particularly great, but in the context of what's gone before, at least it's something.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>69 min:</strong> De Carmargo is booked for something and nothing he visits upon Gerrard's person.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>71 min:</strong> Gerrard tries a 40-yard crossfield ball towards Babel on the left wing. It travels about 70 yards. This is disjointed rubbish from Liverpool.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>74 min:</strong> The crowd are getting frustrated. The 60s classic \"Attack! Attack! Attack! Attack! Attack!\" is trundled out.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>75 min:</strong> The ball is rolled across the Liege six-yard box from the right. It must be a goal, surely? But Keane swipes at fresh air and the chance is gone. The bellowing from the stands - involving the words \"eff\" and \"cee\", I'm saying - had to be heard to be believed.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>77 min:</strong> Reina comes off his line to claim an easy ball, but hesitates slightly. Carragher takes no chances and hoofs it into the stands with Mbokani lurking. The nerves are being betrayed by all 11 men in red.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>78 min:</strong> Defour flings a ball into the box from the right. Had Mbokani flicked his header on, rather than twisting his body and firing a powerless header towards Reina, there were two Liege players free in the area with all the time in the world. Again, some very poor defending by the home side. Where the hell was Arbeloa?</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>82 min:</strong> Liverpool are stroking it about nicely near the centre circle, but the minute they spring forward, through a sudden burst from Gerrard, the ball is lost. Nabil El Zhar replaces Keane.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>85 min:</strong> Oh me, oh my, that was nearly it for Liverpool. Carragher and Skrtel get in all sorts of bother under a huge up and under, allowing Mbokani to take the ball down. Carragher toes it away from him into the centre of the park - where Defour is free in acres. His shot would have been on target, but is brilliantly blocked by the recovering Skrtel. This is nerve-jangling stuff.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>87 min:</strong> Milan Jovanovic, a free-scoring striker who missed the first leg because he nearly left for PSV Eindhoven, comes on for Dalmat.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>88 min:</strong> Alonso, who even in his deepest troughs, can produce the odd moment of quality, unleashes a hell of a daisycutter goalwards, though it's pretty central and easily snaffled by Espinoza.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>90 min:</strong> That should have been the winner for Liege, as De Camargo heads a whipped right-wing cross just high and wide from eight yards when the left-hand side of the Liverpool goal was gaping. Anfield fell silent for a second, and there wasn't too much shouting even when the crowd realised Liverpool had escaped.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>90 min +2:</strong> El Zhar relentlessly wins three sliding tackles in a row, to great cheers, possibly the biggest of the evening. The ball isn't won, a move isn't instigated; that it's come to this.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>FULL TIME: Liverpool 0-0 Standard Li\u00e8ge.</strong> Liege deserve to get to extra time - at least, <em>at least</em> - but that was a truly dreadful performance from Liverpool. You could almost call it disgraceful for a side with pretensions to win this championship, but at least they were trying, I suppose.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>And we're off again. Again:</strong> Once again, Liverpool are kicking towards the Kop first time round. \"Liverpool are obviously playing this one for penalties, right?\" wonders an uneasy Justin Kavanagh. \"Your photo at the top shows that Torres is so certain of Reina saving that he's not even bothered to turn around and look at the penalty.\"</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>ET 2 min:</strong> Camozzato has a dig from the right from nearly 30 yards. The shot was travelling, but Reina is all over it. Liverpool are shambolic.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>ET 4 min:</strong> Alonso shoves Mbokani over as he rushes towards the Liverpool area; remarkably no free kick is given. Any luck Liverpool have required over the two legs of this tie, they have had so far. \"Loathe as I am to accentuate any tenuous positives here, maybe a year out of the CL would benefit Liverpool,\" suggests Lorcan Mullen. \"No papering over the cracks with another fortuitous run, and Benitez properly scrutinised for his insipid league form.\"</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>ET 5 min:</strong> A remarkable spat between Liege manager Laszlo Beloni and Benitez on the touchline. Benitez suggests Mbokani had taken a dive; Beloni disagrees. There is some nose-to-nose swearing, Benitez turns his back - and is immediately shoved in it. You don't need to be a lip reader to work out what is being said. \"Don't touch me. Don't touch me.\" \"Fuck off.\" Dear oh dear.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>ET 6 min:</strong> Dante is booked for, er, not very much.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>ET 8 min:</strong> Torres shanks a cross straight into the Kop. It's so bad it nearly spins back from behind the touchline and back up the pitch. The best striker in Europe, that's what I said earlier, yes I did.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>ET 10 min:</strong> De Camargo is replaced by Salim Toama.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>ET 12 min:</strong> Liverpool are scarcely capable of keeping the ball for more than two passes. \"Lorcan Mullen might be right, a year out of Big Cup might do us good,\" agrees Georgie Lewis. \"Now, how do we get out of the Uefa Cup draw?\"</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>ET 14 min: Liverpool keep the ball for more than two passes!</strong> They keep it for three passes, Babel getting on the end of a long Alonso pass down the inside left channel, before giving it to Kuyt, who wins a corner.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>Half time, extra time, still nothing:</strong> This is dreadful from Liverpool. This is the beginning of Benitez's fifth season. I'm saying nothing, but Liverpool never played as badly as this at the end of Ged Houllier's reign. Or the Roy Evans era. Graeme Souness I'll give you, though.</p> <p><strong>ET 18 min:</strong> Sorry, the tech gremlins have been back out to play. You've missed nothing, but we come back in time for a quick bit of Liverpool pressure, Arbeloa firing one hell of a shot in from the right which would probably have been going wide, but forced Espinosa into a save nonetheless.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>ET 21 min:</strong> Liverpool are creating nothing.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>ET 22 min:</strong> Liverpool should have had a penalty here. Onyewu sticks his foot out as El Zhar skidaddles into the box and upends him. That was as blatant as they come, though El Zhar exaggerated his fall, which might explain the referee's reluctance to award the spot kick. \"How desperate we've become,\" writes Niall Mullen. \"My namesake Lorcan Mullen has resorted to the Houllier blessing in disguise defence.\" In fairness, Liverpool did win the European Cup the minute Ged had done one.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>ET 25 min:</strong> Liverpool are playing for penalties here. Dear oh dear. And they nearly come a cropper playing a high offside line, Mbokani scooting free down the left but starting his run too soon - needlessly as well. \"The 2009 UEFA Cup Final is being held in Istanbul,\" writes Dave Jones. \"Do you<br>think Liverpool are playing for a triumphant return there next May?\"</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>ET 27 min: GOAL!!! Liverpool 1-0 Standard Liege.</strong> It looks like the Istanbul dream is over. Babel slaloms down the left, checks back and swings in a delicious deep cross to the far post. Dante looks to have it covered by Kuyt nips in ahead of him and steers a shot home.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>29 min:</strong> Liege win a corner. A goal now and that will be that. Liverpool somehow scramble it away. As El Zhar races up the pitch with the ball, the referee blows his whistle with Gerrard in the area clutching his head. Torres makes way for Plessis. We're into added time.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>LIVERPOOL HAVE MADE THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE: Liverpool 1-0 Standard Li\u00e8ge.</strong> You have to hand it to Liverpool, who are simply relentless in this competition. However, they are also on occasion inept, and there's no getting away from the fact that's what they were tonight. Still, that's \u00a312m in the pot, \u00a312m which Rafa probably won't be allowed to spend. Which, of course, you could look at one of two ways. But they're through, and that's all they needed to achieve tonight. Nighty night!</p>",
  "<p>Showing once again that the McCain campaign is forgoing the historic courtesy of taking the week off during the opposition convention, it released an advert this morning raising the spectre of Iran and saying Obama isn't prepared to counter the \"threat\".</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QhH2q6h7_Ow?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <object height=\"344\" width=\"425\"><param value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/QhH2q6h7_Ow&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1\" name=\"movie\"/><param value=\"true\" name=\"allowFullScreen\"/><embed height=\"344\" width=\"425\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/v/QhH2q6h7_Ow&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1\"/></object> </figure>   <p>The script: Announcer: Iran. Radical Islamic government. Known sponsors of terrorism. Developing nuclear capabilities to \"generate power\" but threatening to eliminate Israel. Obama says Iran is a \"tiny\" country, \"doesn't pose a serious threat\". Terrorism, destroying Israel, those aren't \"serious threats\"? Obama -- dangerously unprepared to be president.</p> <p>JOHN MCCAIN: I'm John McCain and I approved this message.</p> <p>Read on...</p> <p>Here's a real quick fact check:</p> <p>Obama didn't quite say Iran is \"tiny\" and doesn't \"pose a serious threat\". What he said, in Oregon in May, was: \"Iran, Cuba, Venezuela -- these countries are tiny compared to the Soviet Union. They don't pose a serious threat to us the way the Soviet Union posed a threat to us.\" He went on to advocate direct engagement of the sort John F. Kennedy had with Nikita Khrushchev. And Nixon had with Mao. And Reagan had with Gorbachev.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in a June speech at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, Obama in no uncertain terms acknowledged the threat the Iranian regime does play. He said, \"There is no greater threat to Israel - or to the peace and stability of the region - than Iran.\"</p> <p>The US spent 45 years doing its best to avoid a hot war with the Soviet Union, and we were successful (leaving aside, for argument's sake, the millions dead in cold-war proxy battles like Vietnam, Afghanistan, Angola, Chile and elsewhere). We won the cold war by serving as a moral beacon to the repressed people behind the Iron Curtain and by allowing the Soviet Union to collapse under its own failed economic and political system. We didn't win by bombing them or by rattling the sabre and frightening them into submission.</p> <p>Obama has made it clear he doesn't want war with Iran, a country of 66m with the most unambiguously pro-American population in the middle east. McCain jokes about bombing the country. An ancient people, the Persians are fiercely proud, and are not likely to roll over if the US bombs their nuclear power plants.</p> <p>I don't sense a popular will in the US to go to war with Iran, and my guess is Americans hear in McCain's anti-Iran rhetoric strong echoes of Bush's drive to war with Iraq. That's why I expect this advert might do more harm than good.</p> <p>UPDATE:</p> <p>Obama campaign spokesman Hari Sevugan says:</p> <blockquote> <p>John McCain is distorting Barack Obama's words to cover up for the fact that it's the failed Bush-McCain approach to foreign policy and the Bush-McCain war in Iraq that that have strengthened Iran and endangered Israel. While Barack Obama recognizes that Iran has been the biggest beneficiary of the war in Iraq and that the Bush-McCain fear of tough diplomacy has allowed Iran to spin 3800 centrifuges, threaten Israel, and fund terrorism, John McCain promises more of the same. If John McCain was serious about dealing with the threat from Iran, he would join Barack Obama's bipartisan effort in the Senate to step up sanctions on Iran instead of adopting the same tired, old Bush-Rove playbook.</p> </blockquote>",

Such a result would certainly bring a schmile to Schteve McClaren's faesche and a lethargic shrug from glorious Gooners' leader William Gallas. It would weaken Arsenal's dubious financial health even further. Who knows, defeat tonight could reduce one of the biggest clubs in England to having to entrust their ambitions to a team of barely pubescent novices and cut-price chancers. What? Oh.</p> <p>So come on Gooners, do <a href=\"http://www.thestadium-highbury.com/stadium_main.htm\">your bit</a> to bring some sunshine back to your club - what's a mere \u00a3345,000 between friends?

Due to an almighty technological palaver we've missed the first 25 minutes of this enthralling tie. The boffins have applied some sticky tape and a few well-aimed boots and we appear to have hit upon an improvised solution \u2026 so let's see how far this thing can fly. </p> <p>All you've missed so far, by the way, is some darting runs by the returned Fabregas, a woeful free-kick from Van Persie and an Arsenal corner that Bendter could have headed home if he had a bit of the Brede Hangeland spirit \u2013 instead he just watched it flash across the face of goal.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Arsenal 1-0 (agg: 3-0) Twente (Nasri 26') </strong></p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>26 min:</strong> After an anarchic run by Walcott, Nasri collected the ball at the edge of the box, feinted past one defender and unleashes a mis-hit left-footer that bobbled under the keeper's legs and into the net. Arsenal are on easy street now.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>30 min:</strong> Nasri is regularly breaking into his full Zidane-esque stride now and with Fabregas also on song Arsenal will surely score more. \"I'm stuck in my office here in the States and am relying on your coverage to tell me what's happening --but there's no news yet,\" moaned Bill C. before we got up and running again. \"Surely something has happened in the first Twente minutes? Don't tell me the match has been delayed due to some sort of protest over the loan of Senderos?\"</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>33 min:</strong> Sweet turn by Denilson on the edge of the area \u2013 the first decent thing he's done all night \u2013 and his subsequent low shot required a smart save from the keeper.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>36 min:</strong> Twente can't get out of their own half and Arsenal would have had a second if the laughably awkward Bendter hadn't turned back when clear through. Moments later, Walcott cantered down the right, squared it to Van Persie who had all the time in the world to pick his spot, and threw his hands up in frustration when the Dutchman curled the ball wide. </p> <p>Meanwhile, in an earlier entry that appears to have been lost during our technological meltdown, I asked whether any of you out there works in the Tax Credit Office in Preston? And if so, whether you could tell me how to get them to return a passport to me that I sent them nearly a month ago and which they vowed to send back with \"ten working days\"? Rather than volunteer to pop round and show the diligent civil servants how to use their photocopier (and how to answer their friggin' phone), you sent mails such as this one from Neil Roughley: \"could it be that the tax credit people only work one day per week and therefore they are still well within the timeframe they committed to?\"</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>39 min:</strong> Tiote becomes the third Twente player to cop a booking and they will certainly have one or two dismissed before the night is out because the only way they can stop the rampant Gunners is by tripping them. \"What the heck is an 'anarchic run'?\" blurts Geof Herring. It is what Walcott specialises in \u2013 running very fast in no particular direction with no particular intent other than sowing chaos. It can be effective, at times.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>42 min:</strong> Gallas, showing some rare leadership, seized the initiative and marauded forward before tucking a nice ball in to Walcott at the edge of the area. The badly sideburned whelp slipped it through to Bendter, who completed an ambitious one-two with a surprisingly deft backheel, and Walcott chipped the ball over the out-rushing keeper and wide.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>45 min:</strong> Twente are seemingly trying to refamiliarise themselves with the ball, and quite enjoying stroking it around their backline.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>Half-time:</strong> There's no way Arsenal can lose this now, but do come back for the second period to see if they can overcome their sloppiness to add at least a second.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>It's Blair Parsons again</strong>: \"Hey Paul, have you ever noticed that Bendtner looks like what I imagine a young Ivan Drago would look like? If he celebrates a goal with \"I will break you\" I'll fall out of my chair.\" Do you know that I have never given any thought to what you imagine a young Ivan Drago looks like? However, I can confirm that your floor is not in danger because Bendter won't score tonight.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p>Sticking it to Wenger, <strong>Andrew Culp</strong>-style. \"Wenger says one player brought in won't make much of a difference, eh? Well the player he brought in this summer is the only one to score any goals since the season kicked off against West Brom, so I'd say he's wrong. Maybe one more player and we can get a draw against Hull in a month's time.\"</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>46 min: </strong>We have resumption. \"Why, for god's sakes, does Wenger not give Vela a run out?\" hollers Champe Fitzhugh. \"Are we not missing a sharp scoring edge? And has he not provided just that throughout the preseason? If there is a reason I'd love to hear it.\" Good point, Champe, and on a similar note I wonder why Fabregas hasn't been withdrawn? He's just returned from injury wouldn't it be sensible to take him off and preserve him for the weekend's league action? Maybe give Ramsey or Song another taste of the action instead.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>49 min:</strong> Technically speaking, the second half has started. In real terms, it hasn't. Nothing has happened. Oops, I spoke too soon: Arsenal have just won a throw-in! \"It seems like van Persie has had an inflated reputation,\" interjects Paul Bradley. \"He very rarely gets the ball on target. Perhaps Wenger could buy four or five new players and try them instead of this bunch. Bendtner is a donkey, Adebayor hasn't done much since the African Nations Cup ... and I'm losing faith.\" Hasn't done much since the ANC? Why, didn't he score a hat-trick against the mighty Derby towards the end of last season?</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Arsenal 2-0 (agg: 4-0) Twente (Gallas 52')</strong></p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>52 min:</strong> Gallas, in fairness, injected some much needed urgency, picking the ball up off Fabregas and storming towards the box. His run was curtailed bu the ball broke to Bendter, who, from the sort of position Thierry Henry habitually curled the ball into the far corner, curled the ball straight at the keeper. Gallas had continued his forward momentum and pounced on the rebound to bundle it into the net.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>54 min:</strong> Twente penetrate the Arsenal box for the first time and Djourou gifts them a penalty! He clattered into Elia, who got to the ball first. But wait, what's this? The ref has waved play on. Lucky, lucky Arsenal. Not that it would have made much difference, mind.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>57 min: McClaren watch:</strong> He's schwigging from a plastic bottle of water and schouting schomething, presumably either inschtructions or \"help!\".</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>60 min:</strong> The Arsenal defence fail to deal with a corner. Fortunately for them the two unmarked Twente strikers can't connect with the ball either, \"Who wasn't putting hat-tricks past Mighty Derby? You could have, I could have, even the imaginary persona of the Fiver could have\u2026\" reckons Rob Rayburn. \"Next you're going to tell us he managed to tie his own boots before each game and therefore has \"done something\"\" The egg will be on your face for disparaging Derby, Ray, when they win a match. Assuming you're still alive in 2165.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>64 min:</strong> <br>As Arsenal's desire dies, Clichy commits a foul on the edge of the box. Before it can be tgaken, Wenger withdraws Van Persie, who's been woeful tonight, and introduces Adebayor. The Togolese gets a tepid cheer from the home crowd. And Twente curl the free-kick into the wall, Walcott deflecting it out for a corner. Which is easily cleared.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Arsenal 3-0 (Agg: 5-0) Twente. (Walcott 65')</strong></p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>65 min: </strong>While attempting to control the ball, Bendter unwittingly played an incisive pass to Walcott, who curled it into the far corner from the edge of the box. Lovely finish. And that marks the end of Fabregas's game, as he's replaced by Song, who's long overdue a stint in midfield rather than in defence.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>67 min: </strong> You'll note that Bendter still hasn't scored, and won't.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>71 min:</strong> Twente are pluckily attempting to nab a souvenir goal from their trip to London. They're knocking the ball around about 20 yards short of the Gunners' box, and hoping the path to goal will simply open up before them. \"Re: Blair Parsons: surely the only person who looks like a young Ivan Drago would be a young Dolph Lundgren?\" quibbles Gary Wraith.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>73 min:</strong> Denilson lofts a respectable ball over the top for Bendtner to chase. The big Dane gets there before the defenders \u2026 then stands on the ball and loses possession. \"Why didn't Wenger go out and try to get a replacement for Eduardo?\" screams Gary Naylor. \" If a replacement wasn't needed, why did he buy Eduardo in the first place? How would the Professor answer that one? Bendtner!!!!!\"</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>76 min:</strong> Excellent work down the left by Clichy culminates with the full-back clipping a nice cross towards the penalty spot. The only drawback? There were no Arsenal players there.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>78 min:</strong> A pause in play as Denilson receives some token treatment after copping one in the Eric Halls.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>80 min:</strong> As the tempo drops, Adebayor lopes reluctantly towards the ball and gets his first touch since coming on. Nearly.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>82 min:</strong> Eboue slips the ball through to Bendtner, who is clear in front of goal! But he delays his shot and is deprived by a fine tackle by a retreating defender. \"I don't know why you continue to propagate this completely unfair notion that Bendtner is a bad footballer,\" fumes Angus C. \"He was tremendous for Birmingham on loan, scored some vital goals for Arsenal last season, his international record is exemplary for a player of his age. And tonight he has shown a couple of times that he has a deft touch and selfless work ethic. His large, lanky frame will make him look awkward at times, but it's slack to jump on that trait and consequently suggest that he's not very good.\" A solid work ethic is the very least I demand from a professional, Angus, and I maintain that though he is obviously quite good he is not of the standard required, at least not yet. Compare him to the frontmen and the other big four clubs, such as, um, Dirk Kuyt. Oh.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>85 min:</strong> Gallas throws himself at the ball to block a Denneboom shot. He's played quite well tonight, the captain.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>87 min:</strong> Twente make a substitution, throwing on Slobodan Rajkovic, a Serbia left-back who's on loan from Chelsea. That is all.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Arsenal 4-0 (agg: 6-0) Twente (Bendtner!!! 88')</strong></p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>88 min:</strong> Aided by inept defending, Arsenal fluther with the ball in Twente's box. Bendtner had a chance to shoot but let the ball run away from him, Denilson knocked it back and, from eight yards, the Dane slotted it under the keeper and into the net. So we've had a shock tonight after all!</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>Full-time:</strong> Oh dear, looks like I won't have time to publish all those emails form gloating Bendtner fans. Sorry about that. Really.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p>&#xa0;</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p>OK, one final thought, from Bill McGrath. \"Did Bendtner do the 'I will break you' Ivan Drago celebration so that Blair Parsons could fall out of his chair?\"</p>",
  "<p>There is a good chance that Jamie Oliver thinks you are a feckless, gadget-obsessed, beer-swilling TV addict who is clueless about good food. In an <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7580723.stm\"> unguarded outburst</a> in an interview with the French magazine Paris Match, Oliver \u2013 irritating mockney chef turned voice of the outraged middle classes \u2013 said that 80% of Brits do not sit around a table for dinner, especially \"in London and in the big cities of the north\", and apparently this exposes our moral \"poverty\".<br> The Bob Geldof of chefs declared: </p> <blockquote> <p> The people I'm talking about have enormous televisions \u2013 a lot bigger than my own \u2013 the latest in mobile phones, cars and they go and get drunk in pubs at the weekend. Their poverty shows in the way they feed themselves.</p> </blockquote> <p>In other words, we might be materially well-off, but we are culinary tramps.<br> Foreign reporters are shocked. A startled Australian headline <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/08/26/2346227.htm\">declared</a>: \"Jamie Oliver roasts drunken slob Brits.\" They shouldn't be so surprised. Oliver's seeming attack on the habits of 80% of Britain (otherwise known as the masses) exposes what lies behind contemporary food snobbery: actual snobbery. His seamless shift from talking about turkey twizzlers to having a dig at our consumerism (all those enormous TVs) and our fancy for alcohol (\"they get drunk in pubs at the weekend\") shows that today's obsession with healthy eating often masks a disdain for the lifestyles of the lower orders.<br> People should have seen it coming. Oliver's earlier campaigns to encourage the nation to eat healthier food were shot through with anti-mass sentiment. During his school dinners crusade for Channel 4 he referred to those parents who don't sit around a table to eat dinner as \"what we have learnt to call 'white trash'\". (In more polite lingo, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/aug/24/1\">Rosie Boycott</a>, London's new food tsar, says eating together can help make society more \"cohesive\".) Later, Oliver described <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/mick_hume/article639469.ece\">mums and dads</a> who give their children fizzy drinks and crisps as <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-wellbeing/health-news/jamie-oliver-rages-against-crime-of-junkfood-diets-415089.html\">\"arseholes\" and \"tossers\"</a> and said that even the best packed lunches are \"<a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-wellbeing/health-news/jamie-is-back-on-the-offensive-over-school-dinners-472458.html\">shit</a>\".<br> In case viewers were wondering \"Who are these evil people who feed their kids crap?\", Oliver's series, when it wasn't poking around in school canteens, mostly focused on large families on relatively poor estates where stressed-out mums sought to feed their nippers on tight budgets. We used to call them \"the working classes\"; now we look at them as shit-eating tossers. As someone who comes from a family of eight in a terraced house, and whose mother necessarily took a conveyor-belt approach to dinnertime (serving up fish fingers, mashed potatoes and a clip around the lughole if you took more than five minutes to eat it), I watched Oliver's snide, aloof, unsympathetic series and continually thought: who's the real tosser here? Today's foodie fundamentalism \u2013 from TV shows that poke about in people's faeces to government advice on how much fruit and veg we should eat \u2013 is a deeply moralistic campaign dressed up as health advice. Behind the scientific gloss of offering people tips on nutritional content, there lurks a snobbish disdain for people's behaviour and values. People who eat junk food tend to be looked upon as \"junk people\". They are judged as lazy for buying microwaveable meals, and as bad parents for feeding their children \"shit\". Their expanding waistlines are considered a physical manifestation of their moral turpitude, evidence that they are heretics in an era of healthy living. That is why \"concern\" for their diet can so quickly turn into hateful comments about their child-rearing techniques or class background: because food has become the one issue through which it is acceptable to vomit bile on to the allegedly slovenly sections of society. This has eerie echoes of past mass-bashing episodes. As John Carey showed in his landmark study <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Intellectuals-Masses-Prejudice-Intelligentsia-1880-1939/dp/0897335074\">The Intellectuals and the Masses</a>, in the early 20th century, snobbery about \"the poor\" was frequently expressed in coded attacks on their eating habits. Where Oliver bemoans turkey twizzlers or crisps, <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/200503280004\">earlier snobs</a> attacked tinned food, viewing it as a symbol of the \"soullessness\" and \"stinginess\" of the masses.<br> Carey argued that tinned food \"offends against what the intellectual designates as nature: it is mechanical and soulless\". Today, too, the microwaveable meals or takeaways sometimes enjoyed by big, busy, frenetic families offends against what the food snobs consider to be the \"good life\": slowness, homeliness, and professionally cooked expensive meals eaten around rustic tables. Today's food snobbery is not really about health at all: it is an intolerant attack on other people's morals, lifestyles and values.</p>",

The three men - all said to have been high on methamphetamine when arrested - are the subject of an assassination investigation, but so far, authorities say, it appears they had no capacity to carry out any attack on Obama.</p> <p>A Colorado federal prosecutor, Troy Eid, said the vague racist threats from the men would continue to be investigated. He said he did not know whether Obama had been briefed on the arrests or whether security plans would change for his acceptance speech on Thursday.</p> <p>Court documents had one man quoting another as speaking of wanting to kill Obama on his inauguration day by using a sniper rifle to shoot him from high ground. The comments amount to the \"the racist ramblings of three meth heads\", Eid insisted.</p> <p>The three men were arrested after a truck containing drugs, guns and ammunition was stopped on the outskirts of Denver. The driver was named as Tharin Gartrell. Shawn Adolf, who wore a swastika ring and was wanted on drug charges, was arrested when police came to the hotel where he was staying in a Denver suburb. He jumped from the sixth floor, landing on a flat roof and breaking his ankle. He tried to run but was arrested.</p> <p>The third man, Nathan Johnson, was arrested at an upmarket hotel in Denver. His statements to police during an eight-hour interview appeared to have raised fears of a threat to Obama. In an interview with a local CBS station while in custody, Johnson accused the other two men of making racist statements about Obama. He said they had spoken about shooting Obama on the day of his speech, saying: \"He don't belong in political office or blacks don't belong in political office.\" Johnson denied being involved in the plot.</p> <p>Concerns about the safety of Obama, who would be America's first African American president should he win in November, led the US secret service to provide round-the-clock protection from early in his bid.</p> <p>Some white supremacist groups would like to see Obama killed, according to Mark Potok, an expert in neo-Nazi groups at the Southern Poverty Law Centre in Alabama. Threats against Obama were circulating on the internet, said Potok, whose organisation monitors and opposes hate groups.</p> <p>He cited a threat posted on the law centre's website in April that read, with a misspelled word: \"ATTENTION, IF OBAMA BECOMES PRESEDANT I WILL KILL HIM MYSELF MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT.\"</p> <p>Potok said white supremacists overwhelmingly believe the Colorado case was a set-up by authorities determined to smash their groups. He based his assertion on information gleaned from neo-Nazi websites.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Friday August 29 2008. In the article above we said that Barack Obama would be America's first African American president should he win in October. The US presidential election takes place in November. This has been corrected.</p>",

  "<p>It was hot and sweaty in Denver on Tuesday, getting more humid as evening drew in. But just moments before Hillary Clinton was due to address the Democratic party's national convention, the skies opened in drenching rain, clearing the air. If you wanted a perfect metaphor \u2013 a <a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/446415/pathetic-fallacy\">pathetic fallacy</a>, in fact \u2013 for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/27/uselections2008.hillaryclinton\">Hillary Clinton's speech</a> this evening, then there it was.</p> <p>To call Clinton's speech eagerly awaited would be an understatement. The drumbeat of the media of Clintonian reluctance in the last week \u2013 including a curious <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/22/us/politics/22clinton.html\">New York Times article</a> that found even Clinton's supporters complaining that she was campaigning for Barack Obama too tepidly \u2013 has been a steady background to the convention, as if Hillary was Achilles sulking in her tent, nursing her grievances and refusing to fight. But not any more. Last night's effort should delete any serious idea that she remains disenchanted or passively hostile towards Obama. She made that obvious right from the outset \u2013 as she had to \u2013 by saying:</p> <blockquote> <p>I am honoured to be here tonight. I'm here tonight as a proud mother. As a proud Democrat. As a proud senator from New York. A proud American. And a proud supporter of Barack Obama.</p> <p>And whether you voted for me, or voted for Barack, the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose. We are on the same team, and none of us can afford to sit on the sidelines.</p> </blockquote> <p>But it wasn't her up-front support for Obama that was most effective in blunting the Clintonian refuseniks in the Pepsi Centre, not to mention the <a href=\"http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2008/08/26/1295191.aspx\">more worrying guerillas</a> prowling around Denver in their Puma T-shirts. Instead it was her brilliant use of a rhetorical device that showed her to be far more effective in argument than her utilitarian speaking style suggests.</p> <p>Hillary Clinton is no barnstorming speaker, as a rule. She showed it again for much of last night, when she repeatedly stepped on her own applause lines and so stifled the audience's enthusiasm when she could have ridden it, as Bill Clinton would have. Not long into the speech she seemed to have settled into a familiar theme of her stump speeches during the primaries \u2013 the recitation of various struggling Americans who urged her on, such as the small boy who sold his bicycle to donate to her campaign, and many others.</p> <p>Some of these inspirations became familiar friends to anyone following the long primary season (at least one turned out not to be true, but that wasn't Clinton's fault). Some of them <a href=\"http://www.hillaryclinton.com/news/speech/view/?id=7903\">resurfaced</a> one more time in Denver last night:</p> <blockquote> <p>I will always remember the young man in a Marine Corps T-shirt who waited months for medical care and he said to me: 'Take care of my buddies; a lot of them are still over there, and then will you please take care of me?'</p> </blockquote> <p>But this time, there was a twist \u2013 the twist of a knife. After thanking her supporters, Clinton listed the policies that she had fought for, noting: \"Those are the reasons I ran for president. and those are the reasons I support Barack Obama for president.\" Then she stopped dead in her tracks, and said:</p> <blockquote> <p>I want you to ask yourselves: Were you in this campaign just for me? Or were you in it for that young Marine and others like him? Were you in it for that mom struggling with cancer while raising her kids? Were you in it for that young boy and his mom surviving on the minimum wage? Were you in it for all the people in this country who feel invisible?</p> </blockquote> <p>At a stroke Clinton had confronted her supporters, directly, although in such a way that it turned the question back on those who cling to her candidacy to the point of withholding their votes from Obama. Instead, they were suddenly cast adrift on their own egos.</p> <p>Such a profound challenge by a politician to her own supporters is very rare indeed. It's a luxury that only a secure and confident leader can afford. It also absolves Clinton herself of responsibility of what any remaining rump of her supporters choose to do. It's not about her now \u2013 it's about them.</p>",

A proud mother. A proud Democrat. A proud American. And a proud supporter of Barack Obama,\" she said, opening her speech.</p> <p>Demonstrating the party discipline she has shown throughout her political career, she repeated the call for party unity at regular intervals throughout the 25-minute speech. \"We are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines,\" she said.</p> <p>Die-hard Clintonites have taken comfort in her earlier pronouncements, saying they were ambiguous. But there was no ambiguity in her speech last night.</p> <p>Each of her calls for unity was greeted with loud cheers, suggesting the party was beginning the process of coming together.</p> <p>The resistance threatened by her most fervent supporters appears to be petering out. A formal roll call of her support is likely to be held at the convention today but it will only be symbolic. </p> <p>The dominance by the Clintons of the Democratic party for most of the last two decades appears to be just about over. But if Obama was to lose in November, Clinton could hope to try again in 2012.</p> <p>The convention acknowledged her tenacity in the fight with Obama for the Democratic nomination - the first woman to come so close - by giving her a three-minute standing ovation. The hall turned into a sea of white and blue Hillary placards.</p> <p>She was introduced by her daughter Chelsea who described her as her hero and husband Bill watched from the sidelines</p> <p>She paid tribute to those who had backed her campaign. \"To my supporters, my champions - my sisterhood of the travelling pantsuits - from the bottom of my heart: thank you. You never gave in. You never gave up. And together we made history.\"</p> <p>In a speech free of rancour or resentment, she loyally made the case for Obama and his vice-presidential running mate, Joe Biden.</p> <p>\"I ran to stand up for all those who have been invisible to their government for eight long years. Those are the reasons I ran for president. Those are the reasons I support Barack Obama. And those are the reasons you should too,\" she said.</p> <p>She indulged in just one jibe at Obama, over healthcare, in which she favours the speedy introduction of universal care while he prefers a phased approach. \"I can't wait to watch Barack Obama sign a healthcare plan into law that covers every single American,\" she said.</p> <p>Earlier in the day, she formally released her 1,896 supporters from pledges to vote for her at the convention, a symbolic move that frees them to vote for Obama in a show of party unity.</p> <p>The speech by the woman who has gone further than any other in US politics coincided with the 88th anniversary of the adoption of the constitutional amendment that gave women the right to vote,</p> <p>In contrast with the first day of the convention, which many delegates criticised for failing to land punches on the Republicans, Clinton rounded on both president George Bush and the Republican candidate, John McCain.</p> <p>\"John McCain says the economy is fundamentally sound. John McCain doesn't think that 47m people without health insurance is a crisis. John McCain wants to privatise social security. And in 2008, he still thinks it is okay when women don't earn equal pay for equal work,\" she said.</p> <p>It was appropriate that Bush and McCain should appear together at the Republican convention in Minneapolis-St Paul next week \"because these days they're awfully hard to tell apart\".</p> <p>Bill Clinton could prove to be less disciplined tomorrow evening. The Obama campaign team wanted to edit his speech to ensure he stuck to the theme of the day, national security.</p> <p>But Clinton, who feels Obama has failed to pay homage to the economic successes during his presidency, is intent on speaking about not only national security but the economy and his administration's achievements.</p> <p>In spite of her loyal speech, there is frustration in the Obama camp that she dominated one of only four precious convention days.</p> <p>Bill Clinton's speech and the prospect of a symbolic roll call of her supporters tomorrow will again overshadow Obama's message.</p>",
  "<p>I am honoured to be here tonight. A proud mother. A proud Democrat. A proud American. And a proud supporter of Barack Obama.</p> <p>My friends, it is time to take back the country we love.</p> <p>Whether you voted for me, or voted for Barack, the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose. We are on the same team, and none of us can sit on the sidelines.</p> <p>This is a fight for the future. And it's a fight we must win.</p> <p>I haven't spent the past 35 years in the trenches advocating for children, campaigning for universal healthcare, helping parents balance work and family and fighting for women's rights at home and around the world ... to see another Republican in the White House squander the promise of our country and the hopes of our people.</p> <p>And you haven't worked so hard over the last 18 months, or endured the last eight years, to suffer through more failed leadership.</p> <p>No way. No how. No McCain.</p> <p>Barack Obama is my candidate. And he must be our president.</p> <p>Tonight we need to remember what a presidential election is really about. When the polls have closed, and the ads are finally off the air, it comes down to you - the American people, your lives and your children's futures.</p> <p>For me, it's been a privilege to meet you in your homes, your workplaces, and your communities. Your stories reminded me every day that America's greatness is bound up in the lives of the American people - your hard work, your devotion to duty, your love for your children and your determination to keep going, often in the face of enormous obstacles.</p> <p>You taught me so much, you made me laugh, and ... you even made me cry. You allowed me to become part of your lives. And you became part of mine.</p> <p>I will always remember the single mom who had adopted two kids with autism, didn't have health insurance and discovered she had cancer. But she greeted me with her bald head painted with my name on it and asked me to fight for healthcare.</p> <p>I will always remember the young man in a Marine Corps t-shirt who waited months for medical care and said to me: \"Take care of my buddies; a lot of them are still over there \u2026 and then will you please help take care of me?\"</p> <p>I will always remember the boy who told me his mom worked for the minimum wage and that her employer had cut her hours. He said he just didn't know what his family was going to do.</p> <p>I will always be grateful to everyone from all 10 states, Puerto Rico and the territories, who joined our campaign on behalf of all those people left out and left behind by the Bush administration.</p> <p>To my supporters, my champions - my sisterhood of the traveling pantsuits - from the bottom of my heart: thank you.</p> <p>You never gave in. You never gave up. And together we made history.</p> <p>Along the way, America lost two great Democratic champions who would have been here with us tonight. One of our finest young leaders, Arkansas Democratic Party chair, Bill Gwatney, who believed with all his heart that America and the south could be and should be Democratic from top to bottom.</p> <p>And congresswoman Stephanie Tubbs Jones, a dear friend to many of us, a loving mother and courageous leader who never gave up her quest to make America fairer and smarter, stronger and better. Steadfast in her beliefs, a fighter of uncommon grace, she was an inspiration to me and to us all.</p> <p>Our heart goes out to Stephanie's son, Mervyn, Jr, and Bill's wife, Rebecca, who traveled to Denver to join us at our convention.</p> <p>Bill and Stephanie knew that after eight years of George Bush, people are hurting at home, and our standing has eroded around the world. We have a lot of work ahead.</p> <p>Jobs lost, houses gone, falling wages, rising prices. The supreme court in a right-wing headlock and our government in partisan gridlock. The biggest deficit in our nation's history. Money borrowed from the Chinese to buy oil from the Saudis.</p> <p>Putin and Georgia, Iraq and Iran.</p> <p>I ran for president to renew the promise of America. To rebuild the middle class and sustain the American dream, to provide the opportunity to work hard and have that work rewarded, to save for college, a home and retirement, to afford the gas and groceries and still have a little left over each month.</p> <p>To promote a clean energy economy that will create millions of green collar jobs.</p> <p>To create a healthcare system that is universal, high-quality and affordable so that parents no longer have to choose between care for themselves or their children or be stuck in dead end jobs simply to keep their insurance.</p> <p>To create a world-class education system and make college affordable again.</p> <p>To fight for an America defined by deep and meaningful equality - from civil rights to labour rights, from women's rights to gay rights, from ending discrimination to promoting unionisation to providing help for the most important job there is: caring for our families. To help every child live up to his or her God-given potential.</p> <p>To make America once again a nation of immigrants and a nation of laws.</p> <p>To bring fiscal sanity back to Washington and make our government an instrument of the public good, not of private plunder.</p> <p>To restore America's standing in the world, to end the war in Iraq, bring our troops home and honor their service by caring for our veterans.</p> <p>And to join with our allies to confront our shared challenges, from poverty and genocide to terrorism and global warming.</p> <p>Most of all, I ran to stand up for all those who have been invisible to their government for eight long years.</p> <p>Those are the reasons I ran for president. Those are the reasons I support Barack Obama. And those are the reasons you should too.</p> <p>I want you to ask yourselves: Were you in this campaign just for me? Or were you in it for that young Marine and others like him? Were you in it for that mom struggling with cancer while raising her kids? Were you in it for that boy and his mom surviving on the minimum wage? Were you in it for all the people in this country who feel invisible?</p> <p>We need leaders once again who can tap into that special blend of American confidence and optimism that has enabled generations before us to meet our toughest challenges. Leaders who can help us show ourselves and the world that with our ingenuity, creativity and innovative spirit, there are no limits to what is possible in America.</p> <p>This won't be easy. Progress never is. But it will be impossible if we don't fight to put a Democrat in the White House.</p> <p>We need to elect Barack Obama because we need a president who understands that America can't compete in a global economy by padding the pockets of energy speculators, while ignoring the workers whose jobs have been shipped overseas. We need a president who understands that we can't solve the problems of global warming by giving windfall profits to the oil companies while ignoring opportunities to invest in new technologies that will build a green economy.</p> <p>We need a president who understands that the genius of America has always depended on the strength and vitality of the middle class.</p> <p>Barack Obama began his career fighting for workers displaced by the global economy. He built his campaign on a fundamental belief that change in this country must start from the ground up, not the top down. He knows government must be about \"we the people\" not \"we the favored few\".</p> <p>And when Barack Obama is in the White House, he'll revitalise our economy, defend the working people of America, and meet the global challenges of our time. Democrats know how to do this. As I recall, President Clinton and the Democrats did it before. And President Obama and the Democrats will do it again.</p> <p>He'll transform our energy agenda by creating millions of green jobs and building a new, clean energy future. He'll make sure that middle-class families get the tax relief they deserve. And I can't wait to watch Barack Obama sign a healthcare plan into law that covers every single American.</p> <p>Barack Obama will end the war in Iraq responsibly and bring our troops home - a first step to repairing our alliances around the world.</p> <p>And he will have with him a terrific partner in Michelle Obama. Anyone who saw Michelle's speech last night knows she will be a great first lady for America.</p> <p>Americans are also fortunate that Joe Biden will be at Barack Obama's side. He is a strong leader and a good man. He understands both the economic stresses here at home and the strategic challenges abroad. He is pragmatic, tough and wise. And, of course, Joe will be supported by his wonderful wife, Jill.</p> <p>They will be a great team for our country.</p> <p>Now, John McCain is my colleague and my friend.</p> <p>He has served our country with honor and courage.</p> <p>But we don't need four more years ... of the last eight years.</p> <p>More economic stagnation \u2026 and less affordable healthcare.</p> <p>More high gas prices \u2026 and less alternative energy.</p> <p>More jobs getting shipped overseas \u2026 and fewer jobs created here.</p> <p>More skyrocketing debt ... home foreclosures \u2026 and mounting bills that are crushing our middle-class families.</p> <p>More war ... less diplomacy.</p> <p>More of a government where the privileged come first \u2026 and everyone else comes last.</p> <p>John McCain says the economy is fundamentally sound. John McCain doesn't think that 47m people without health insurance is a crisis. John McCain wants to privatise Social Security. And in 2008, he still thinks it's okay when women don't earn equal pay for equal work.</p> <p>With an agenda like that, it makes sense that George Bush and John McCain will be together next week in the Twin Cities. Because these days they're awfully hard to tell apart.</p> <p>America is still around after 232 years because we have risen to the challenge of every new time, changing to be faithful to our values of equal opportunity for all and the common good.</p> <p>And I know what that can mean for every man, woman and child in America. I'm a United States senator because in 1848 a group of courageous women and a few brave men gathered in Seneca Falls, New York, many traveling for days and nights, to participate in the first convention on women's rights in our history.</p> <p>And so dawned a struggle for the right to vote that would last 72 years, handed down by mother to daughter to granddaughter - and a few sons and grandsons along the way.</p> <p>These women and men looked into their daughters' eyes, imagined a fairer and freer world, and found the strength to fight. To rally and picket. To endure ridicule and harassment. To brave violence and jail.</p> <p>And after so many decades - 88 years ago on this very day - the 19th amendment guaranteeing women the right to vote would be forever enshrined in our Constitution.</p> <p>My mother was born before women could vote. But in this election my daughter got to vote for her mother for president.</p> <p>This is the story of America. Of women and men who defy the odds and never give up.</p> <p>How do we give this country back to them?</p> <p>By following the example of a brave New Yorker , a woman who risked her life to shepherd slaves along the Underground Railroad.</p> <p>And on that path to freedom, Harriett Tubman had one piece of advice.</p> <p>If you hear the dogs, keep going.</p> <p>If you see the torches in the woods, keep going.</p> <p>If they're shouting after you, keep going.</p> <p>Don't ever stop. Keep going.</p> <p>If you want a taste of freedom, keep going.</p> <p>Even in the darkest of moments, ordinary Americans have found the faith to keep going.</p> <p>I've seen it in you. I've seen it in our teachers and firefighters, nurses and police officers, small business owners and union workers, the men and women of our military - you always keep going.</p> <p>We are Americans. We're not big on quitting.</p> <p>But remember, before we can keep going, we have to get going by electing Barack Obama president.</p> <p>We don't have a moment to lose or a vote to spare.</p> <p>Nothing less than the fate of our nation and the future of our children hang in the balance.</p> <p>I want you to think about your children and grandchildren come election day. And think about the choices your parents and grandparents made that had such a big impact on your life and on the life of our nation.</p> <p>We've got to ensure that the choice we make in this election honours the sacrifices of all who came before us, and will fill the lives of our children with possibility and hope.</p> <p>That is our duty, to build that bright future, and to teach our children that in America there is no chasm too deep, no barrier too great - and no ceiling too high - for all who work hard, never back down, always keep going, have faith in God, in our country and in each other.</p> <p>Thank you so much. God bless America and Godspeed to you all.</p>"
