  "<p>This presidential race has generated a high level of excitement and today's election promises to have a record turnout of voters. This is a combination of a huge number of new voters, most registered by the Obama campaign and its allies, and predicted participation of 80-90% of all voters. Unfortunately, the planning and logistics to handle this voter flood has been inadequate, and voters in many places are going to suffer through multi-hour waits. This has already happened in <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/10/24/voting.problems/\">early voting in Florida and other states</a>. <br> Long lines might seem like a mere inconvenience, but in fact they seriously undermine democracy. Many voters cannot wait for hours. They are forced by personal circumstances to leave without voting, and are thereby disenfranchised. This group would include, for example, people who must get to work and try to vote early in the morning, those who can only take off a short time from work to vote, parents or other caregivers taking care of children and the disabled. It is readily apparent that less affluent workers who have least control of their lives will be affected first and most. Rachel Maddow, on her <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26315908/\">MSNBC programme</a> on Monday night, called long voting lines the modern version of the poll tax, an infamous (and now illegal) ploy in the US south to charge voters for the privilege of voting, and thereby suppress voting by poor and minorities.<br> The formation of long queues at polling places is very similar to highway congestion. As traffic increases, flow slows until a critical density is reached at which traffic locks up and lines form that may take hours to clear. This behaviour is governed by the mathematics of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queueing_theory\">queuing theory</a>, which we have used to examine the circumstances that cause voter lines to form.<br> For example, the average Maryland voting precinct has about 2,000 registered voters and 10 computer touch-screen voting machines. If 1,500 voters show up, then <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.5577\">computer simulation of the voting process</a> predicts that taking longer than five minutes each to vote will result in waits of over one hour at 10% of polling places. Six-minute voting times will produce greater than two-hour waits in the majority of precincts. The incidence and length of queues is a highly nonlinear \u2013 and in real life, unpredictable \u2013 function of voter density.<br> Therefore, it is critically important to have ample excess capacity of voting means in order to stay well clear of any conditions that would cause long voter queues. Unfortunately, computerised touch-screen voting systems (alias DREs, for \"Direct Recording Electronic\") are not flexible enough to deal with sudden fluctuations in voter numbers, whereas voting based on paper ballots can be quickly scaled to avoid long lines. Touch-screen voting machines cost over $3,000 each, so it is prohibitively expensive (and logistically impractical) to change voting machine numbers even with several months notice. About 1/3 of American voters will be using these DRE machines in this election, so we are in grave danger of having many venues with long lines. An alternative to touch-screen voting machines is hand-marked paper ballots tallied by scanners. These will be used by over 55% of Americans in this election. The traffic choke point for paper ballot/scanner system is the number of voters who can simultaneously mark ballots. This is usually done with inexpensive \"privacy booths\" that cost $100 to $200, as compared to the $3,000 for touch-screen voting machines noted above. In a pinch, however, cardboard \"privacy screens\" costing a few dollars each can be quickly taped to tables, or voters can be sent to chairs in different parts of a room, in order to instantaneously expand capacity. Maryland voting is presently done using touch-screen voting machines. Colleagues from <a href=\"http://saveourvotes.org/\">Save Our Votes</a> (a Maryland voting-integrity organisation) and I have made a concerted effort to get the Maryland election administration and state board of elections to specify the use of emergency paper ballots in case lines get long. These ballots are already at the polling places, so it would only be necessary to decide when waits are excessive and give voters a choice of using the voting machines or a paper ballot.<br> The secretary of state of Ohio has established this exact policy in order to prevent lines. Unfortunately, Maryland officials have refused to allow this possibility. In the city of Baltimore where I live, the ballot will have the presidential election, a congressional election, two statewide ballot propositions and 16 local ballot propositions. I would guess that this ballot will take voters several minutes to process. It is going to be a long, hard day for everyone.</p>",
  "<p>Doesn't it seem odd that it'll soon be over -- this insane, historic, aggravating, stirring, inspiring, profoundly moving and ridiculous thing that's been a part of our lives for so many months? But the final rallies have taken place, and in a few hours, barring the completely unforeseen, it really will end, amid guaranteed scenes of intense emotion. More than enough has already been written and said about the momentous nature of the choice America faces in this election, and the decision that all the polls suggest it's going to make, so I won't add to that for now. I'll just say this: I'll be liveblogging right here in a short while (at <strong>6pm eastern, 11pm UK time</strong>), bringing you all the presidential results and highlights of the congressional elections as they happen, along with reports from our team in Chicago, Phoenix and elsewhere, and I hope you'll join me.</p> <p><strong>The basics</strong></p> <p>Daniel Nasaw's most excellent guide to the evening is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/nov/04/us-president-election-guide\">here</a>, and I added some thoughts about when and how we can expect the various states to be called tonight <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/oliverburkemanblog/2008/nov/04/uselections2008-barackobama5\">here</a>. Oh -- and I just remembered that CNN will be <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/oliverburkemanblog/2008/oct/30/uselections2008\">interviewing holograms</a>; on any other evening this would surely be the most exciting thing imaginable.</p> <p><strong>Paths to victory</strong></p> <p>The simplest way to look at where we stand tonight is probably this: Barack Obama should win all the states John Kerry won in 2004, despite John McCain's efforts to grab Pennsylvania and (a longer shot) New Hampshire. If he does win the Kerry states, he needs only Florida or Ohio and he's won 270 electoral votes. But before we hear results from those states, we'll almost certainly hear from Virginia: if Obama wins there, he doesn't need Florida or Ohio so long as he gets one of the other battlegrounds -- Colorado, Indiana, Missouri, Iowa, New Mexico, Nevada or North Carolina. (We won't know for sure that he's won, of course, until the Kerry states come in for the Democrats, so the networks will definitely wait for Pennsylvania and New Hampshire, and maybe the others -- not that McCain is going to win California in any remotely credible universe.) If Obama wins none of Florida, Ohio and Virginia, he can certainly still win, but he'll need a combination of those other battlegrounds as well. </p> <p><strong>When will we know?</strong></p> <p>The big problem in constructing any kind of timetable for the night is that we don't know the gap between the closing of polls in a given state, and the calling by the networks: a state closing first doesn't mean it'll be called first, and Florida, especially, will probably keep us waiting. But here's a rough idea of the first half of the evening. At <strong>6pm/11pm</strong>, polls begin to close in <strong>Kentucky and Indiana</strong> (though not in the whole state till <strong>7pm/midnight</strong>); then at 7pm/midnight polls close in <strong>Virginia, Georgia</strong>, and most of <strong>Florida</strong> and <strong>New Hampshire</strong>. Kentucky's a shoo-in for McCain, but Obama is only trailing slightly now in Indiana and Georgia. If either state isn't quickly called for McCain, he's in for a very bad night; should Obama win Indiana, he's in for a landslide. (Results from the west of the state, which is Obama territory near Chicago, will arrive later than in the Republican east.) If Obama wins Virginia alone among all these early states, McCain is going to need to do very well among the tossups, or seize Pennsylvania. </p> <p>At <strong>7.30pm/12.30am</strong> polls close in <strong>Ohio</strong> and <strong>North Carolina</strong>. An Ohio win effectively hands Obama the election, though you'd want to wait for <strong>Pennsyvlania</strong> to be sure; polls close there at <strong>8pm</strong> as they do in 17 other states plus Washington DC, including the swing state of <strong>Missouri</strong>. </p> <p>Got all that? If McCain doesn't win Pennsylvania, and the polls suggest he won't, he'd have to win every single tossup state in order to squeak to victory. So it's perfectly likely this will all be over by about <strong>9pm/2am</strong>. But some people probably said something similar in 2000...<br> <strong>House, Senate, governors</strong></p> <p>I'll bring you highlights of these, at least until we know the identity of the president. Democrats, who lead in the Senate 51-49 (relying on Joe the Lieberman), might get 60 seats -- a filibuster-proof majority, making a Democratic president's work much easier -- for the first time in a generation. They control the House 235-199; if they make gains of 20 or more, we can call that a landslide. Eleven governorships are up for grabs, but it's only North Carolina and Washington where things are close. Democrats currently hold them both.</p> <p><strong>Join in</strong> </p> <p>I want to know where you are, how you're marking tonight, what you're eating and drinking, how you're feeling, what your gut's telling you -- all that stuff. And you might as well tell me, in the comments, because I'm certainly going to be telling you. (I also have fantasies that somebody's following this blog from Vanuatu, or Antarctica, or Pitcairn, so can you please pretend that you are even if you're not?) In an emotional return to the beer consumed during the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/oliverburkemanblog/2008/sep/27/uselections2008.barackobama\">first presidential debate liveblog</a>, all those weeks ago, my choice tonight is <a href=\"http://www.sierranevada.com/\">Sierra Nevada</a>. History, plus beer, here in a little while. </p> <p><strong>6.15pm</strong> (all times eastern from now on): So, polls in most of Indiana and half of Kentucky have closed. In the earliest national exit poll data, which has been dribbling out for a little while now, more than 60% said the economy was their main voting issue. 67% worry about being able to afford healthcare. It's all very different from the \"values\" focus of 2004. <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/11/04/election.president/index.html\">Here's more.</a> Karl Rove is burbling away on Fox at the moment; he says it's the first time since he was 18 years old that he hasn't been directly involved in a presidential election...</p> <p><strong>6.21pm</strong> From the comments: nice to know we're being read in the San Francisco Obama phonebank headquarters, while commenter <strong>evalgoiavot</strong> notes: \"I just watched three epidsodes of battlestar galactica back to back to relieve the tension. I DEMAND CERTAINTY! and also more whisky.\"]</p> <p><strong>6.29pm</strong> For ceremonial reasons, let's mark the first results of the election, even though they're completely meaningless: with fewer than one per cent of votes in, Obama leads McCain 55%-44% in Indiana, while McCain, amazingly enough, leads in Kentucky.</p> <p><strong>6.47pm</strong> OK, back after brief technical issues. Apologies. 13 minutes until polls close in Florida, Georgia, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Vermont and Virginia. Many fantastic comments. </p> <p><strong>6.55pm</strong> The first state exit polls, which are leaking in various places, look a fair bit tighter than some of the polls. Leads of 4%, 2%, 1% and 1% respectively for Obama in PA, VA, FL and OH. But we know there are <a href=\"http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2008/11/ten-reasons-why-you-should-ignore-exit.html\">lots of reasons to distrust exit polls</a>, right?</p> <p><strong>6.56pm</strong> Judging by the comments, almost all of you have better food and drink than me tonight. Thanks for that. Also, where are CNN's holograms -- huh?</p> <p><strong>7.00pm</strong> Polls close in Florida, Georgia, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Vermont and Virginia. <a href=\"http://thepage.time.com/steve-schmidt-remarks-on-straight-talk-air/?xid=rss-page\">Here</a> are the final words on the McCain campaign from McCain's senior strategist Steve Schmidt, although to be honest I'm not sure what the heck they mean. \"Crossing the finish line head up\"? </p> <p><strong>7.01pm</strong> CNN and others call <strong>Vermont</strong> for Obama and <strong>Kentucky</strong> for McCain. Entirely unsurprising! So we begin our electoral college vote count:</p> <p><strong>Obama 3 McCain 8</strong></p> <p><strong>7.10pm</strong> MSNBC predicts a House composition of Dem 261 Rep 174 -- a Democratic landslide -- though there's a significant margin of error to that. Meanwhile: the fact that we don't yet have a call on Indiana is surely a sign that it's going to damn close, isn't it? (Oh -- yes, indeed, the networks and AP agree that it's \"too close to call\", as opposed to simply too early to call. So much for my astonishing Punditry Insight.) Mark Warner, the Democrat, is expected to win the Virginia senate seat he's contesting against Jim Gilmore, which makes a Senate net gain of one.</p> <p><strong>Senate Dem net gain +1</strong></p> <p><strong>7.14pm</strong> Let the record show that Wolf Blitzer is, now, finally, talking to holograms on CNN. They look like slightly worse versions of the holograms in Star Wars, and while they probably look amazing to Wolf they just look like superimposed images to everyone else. Money well spent, CNN!</p> <p><strong>7.23pm</strong> Crowds have begun streaming into Grant Park, Chicago, from where I expect soon to hear from Jonathan Freedland; everybody's running madly for a front-row position. I wonder if any of them <a href=\"http://current.com/items/89474691_will_trade_sex_for_obama_tickets\">got them on Craiglist in highly suspicious circumstances</a>? McCain leads 53% to 46% with 2% of precincts in; McCain leading 51% to 48% in Indiana with 12% in. Mike Tomasky <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2008/nov/05/uselections2008-indiana\">has thoughts</a> on the Indiana situation...</p> <p><strong>7.29pm</strong> OK, real news. Official demographic exit polls, extrapolated to the statewide vote -- a very unreliable exercise -- put Obama at 54%-45% in Virginia and 52%-46% in Indiana. Remember, in 04 the exits said Kerry had won...</p> <p><strong>7.30pm</strong> Polls close in North Carolina, Ohio and West Virginia; Fox calls <strong>West Virginia</strong> for McCain, which would be Obama 3 McCain 13 -- nobody else is following suit yet.</p> <p><strong>7.35pm</strong> Dan Glaister checks in from outside the Frank Lloyd Wright Ballroom of the Biltmore Hotel in Phoenix, where McCain will hold his election night party (although not necessarily attend it, oddly). Two cleaners just left the ballroom. \"Where are all the people, then?\" one said. \"I thought there'd be lots more people than this,\" the other replied. A thrilling atmosphere of excitement, then.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell's seat in Kentucky is too close to call -- a bad sign for the Republicans, and a hint that the Democrats might be in with a shot of their 60-majority goal.</p> <p><strong>7.41pm</strong> Obama;'s at 57%-42% with 80% of precincts reporting, in \"the most bellwether county in the country,\" Vigo County, Indiana, which apparently <a href=\"http://tpmelectioncentral.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/11/indiana_dems_taking_comfort_fr.php\">has only gone against the national result twice since 1892</a>. Make of it what you will. I'm opening my first beer, but not in a celebratory or commiseratory fashion -- anyway, I'm neutral and unbiased, right? -- but because... well, just because. </p> <p><strong>7.45pm</strong> Networks project <strong>McCain to win South Carolina</strong>. [Clarification: for the purposes of the running total, I'll count as called a state that's called by two of the main networks or by a main network and AP, and of course I'll keep you up to date with conflicting opinions, as with Fox on WV.]</p> <p><strong>Obama 3, McCain 16</strong></p> <p><strong>7.51pm</strong>: Some analysis of exit polls from Ohio and North Carolina, <a href=\"http://marcambinder.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/11/north_carolina_and_ohio_exit_p.php\">courtesy of Marc Ambinder</a>: \"In Ohio -- more than 85% say they're worried about the economy; only 16% of Clinton voters are supporting McCain; The share of the black turnout is higher than in 2004; Obama's getting 98% of them. White men and white women are backing McCain -- but very narrowly -- only by three to four points in the exit polls. Obama lost non-college white males by nine points -- that's an improvement over John Kerry's performance.\"</p> <p><strong>8pm</strong>: Polls close in Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, DC, Alabama, Kansas, Mississippi, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, and Missouri. Pennsyvlania's the big question, of course, while Missouri is the other to watch. Stand by for a whole bunch of easy calls. </p> <p><strong>8.01pm</strong>: <strong>Massachusetts, Illinois, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, DC called for Obama, Oklahoma and Tennessee to McCain. ME, which splits its votes, Obama 3 McCain 1 (CNN)</strong></p> <p>which makes it...</p> <p><strong>Obama 77 McCain 34</strong></p> <p>NBC calls Pennsylvania and New Hampshire for Obama, too, making it 103 - 34, and marking the failure of McCain's efforts to make Pennsylvania the centrepiece of his last-ditch campaigning in recent weeks. Oh, and now AP too:</p> <p><strong>Obama 103 McCain 34</strong> Obama takes Pennsylvania. Given the fact that we have essentially none of the precincts reporting, this is indicative of a very big win. </p> <p>And Alabama is too close to call? Wow.</p> <p><strong>8.13pm</strong>: In Phoenix, some Young People are singing a song, while wearing blazers. It's all very nice and very Republican. Joe Biden, meanwhile, has been elected senator for Delaware, which is going to be slightly awkward if he becomes vice-president too. Still, he has a fallback, I suppose. And Jeanne Shaheen, the former New Hampshire governor, seems to have won her race against the incumbent John Sununu, who was always incredibly vulnerable. </p> <p><strong>Senate Dem net gain +2</strong></p> <p><strong>8.22pm</strong>: Ezra Klein <a href=\"http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/ezraklein_archive?month=11&amp;year=2008&amp;base_name=pennsylvania_goes_for_obama_al#110645\">has some exit polls</a> I haven't seen, projecting crazy wins for Obama in Florida, Ohio and Virginia. As he points out, they're probably wildly inflated, if remotely accurate at all...</p> <p><strong>8.25pm</strong>: Ah, <em>marvellous</em>: problems with voting in West Palm Beach, Florida, where absentee ballots, at any rate, appear to require voters to join two boxes together by drawing another box, which is more like a Mensa puzzle than a ballot paper. </p> <p><strong>8.30pm</strong>: Slightly late with this, sorry, but the networks are projecting that Elizabeth Dole, who spent the last part of her campaign accusing Democratic challenger Kay Hagan of being <a href=\"http://tpmelectioncentral.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/11/atheist-baiter_dole_didnt_have.php\">on the side of the evil godless atheists</a>, has been seriously defeated in North Carolina.</p> <p>Polls are closing in Arkansas, which McCain's going to win. </p> <p><strong>8.35pm</strong>: Arkansas, Alabama for McCain...</p> <p><strong>Obama 103, McCain 49</strong></p> <p>...and hints that Georgia is about to go to McCain, too.</p> <p>OK, I'm <strong>moving to a new thread</strong>: please go <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/oliverburkemanblog/2008/nov/05/uselections2008-barackobama\">here.</a></p>",
  "<p>Following Gordon Brown's admission that the government could not guarantee the security of personal data, David Davis <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/nov/03/idcards-civilliberties\">concluded</a> on Comment is Free this week that far from protecting us from identity theft 'the grandiose projects of the British state may prove to be its greatest facilitator.\" </p> <p>This is right, and Davis's message should be understood by far more MPs than is currently the case. He is one of the few in Parliament who has grasped the nature of the threat and the speed at which it approaches us. </p> <p>Yet it is not just security breaches and lapses that we have to worry about. The government is clearly committed to a course of selling our personal data to cover its costs and in some cases, like the ID card's <a href=\"http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts2006/ukpga_20060015_en_1\">National Identity Register</a>, a big commercial operation is envisaged</p> <p>The model for this activity is seen at the <a href=\"http://www.dvla.gov.uk/\">DVLA</a>, which <a href=\"http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/01/17/dvla_data_giveaway/\">sells details</a> of vehicles and drivers for a fee of between \u00a32.50 and \u00a35. For \u00a33,000 a \"reputable user\" \u2013 in other words, a supermarket or security firm - can buy a link to the DVLA database although they still pay the same fee for driver's details on top of that. </p> <p>Although the DVLA insists that it is not a making a profit on the 1.64 million sales per annum, which is hard to believe, the fact remains that a government agency is selling information about us to third parties who may have rather doubtful motives \u2013 like the Parking Eye company which sent an \u00a380 penalty notice to a <a href=\"http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/s/1066954_80_nightmare_for_tired_driver?rss=yes?rss=yes\">driver </a> who broke her late night journey on the M6 to take a nap in her car at Lymm services rather than continue and fall asleep at the wheel.</p> <p>But is not just the DVLA. In the summer the police <a href=\"http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/07/30/commercial_access_dna_database/\">admitted</a> that samples from the national DNA database had been used for unspecified research. How much money changed hands, and what was the purpose of the research, are not known but this is the clearest indication that once the state acquires information \u2013 and here we are talking about the biological essence of thousands of people \u2013 it comes to think of it as its own, to do with it what it likes. </p> <p>The vast databases that are being hastily built before the public realises what it is losing represent an enormous commercial prize. The only people who will not benefit from the sale of our information are us, even though we will be supplying it \u2013 often under duress \u2013 to the government. We'll be soon be in the ridiculous position of giving up every important piece of information about ourselves, together with the right of access to that information, while commercial enterprise will purchase access for their own gain. It is a stark reminder how rapidly the relationship between state and individual has changed in the last decade.</p> <p>Who owns our personal information, what use they make of it, and what access the public should be allowed to its own data \u2013 to correct and formally withdraw it from the database - are issues which are hardly ever discussed by Davis's colleagues, who unthinkingly go along with the idea that possession is ninth-tenths of the law. </p> <p>But there is another route, which starts with each one of us declaring that our personal information is precisely that. It belongs to us and we should have control over it, wherever possible. What we need, but hear little suggestion of in Parliament, is a privacy law that entrenches these rights in the environment of a new Bill of Rights. For if there is one clear message to absorb about current situation in which the state plunders what it likes from our personal lives it is that the section that guarantees privacy in the Human Rights Act is a complete joke, and has in fact been the context in which this gross attack on all our privacy has taken place.</p>",
  "<p>When it comes to human rights, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/nov/03/george-bush-legacy-dubya\">legacy of the Bush years</a> is inevitably going to be dominated by the fall-out from the so-called \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/terrorism\">war on terror</a>\". And, just as inevitably, I'm afraid, this legacy is going to be overwhelmingly negative.</p> <p>Undoubtedly George W Bush and his administration were presented with one of the most acute challenges imaginable after those passenger planes were flown into skyscrapers in New York's financial district in September 2001. This catastrophic atrocity, clearly a huge and monstrous crime, had to be dealt with. Those responsible had to be brought to justice. Anything less would have been an abrogation of responsibility, a breach of human rights responsibilities owed to the victims and their families.</p> <p>But, time and time again, what we have actually seen is a travesty of that aim. The invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq (whatever their justifications) have brought with them wave after wave of dreadful human rights abuses \u2013 from shocking prisoner abuse scandals at Abu Ghraib and Kabul, to reckless missile strikes that have killed countless civilians (not least in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/04/pakistan-us-foreign-policy\">Pakistan</a> in recent weeks).</p> <p>Yes, some people have been apprehended and the Taliban, al-Qaida and other groups have been put to flight in some locations. But the conduct of US military forces has often been questionable and on some occasions has veered into illegality. </p> <p>Most visibly, and most provocatively, the interning of hundreds of people in a military prison at Guant\u00e1namo Bay has thrown down a gauntlet to the rest of the world. The message appears to have been: established norms of international law don't apply to this situation. </p> <p>Guant\u00e1namo is particularly damaging because of its flagrancy. The White House has, when pressed, sought to defend other utterly indefensible practices \u2013 kidnapping and transporting suspects in CIA \"rendition\" operations, holding prisoners in secret \"black site\" jails, or the mistreatment of prisoners, including by \"waterboarding\" torture \u2013 but the warehousing of hundreds of detainees at Guant\u00e1namo has been carried out under the glare of international publicity and had been defended with the full force of the administration's legal armoury.</p> <p>However, in sketching out this quick overview of some of the familiar charges laid against Bush's presidency, my aim is not to damn these eight years as some uniquely lost period where the United States deserted human rights.</p> <p>In fact, <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org.uk/\">Amnesty International</a> and a host of other observers have been criticising the US on human rights grounds back to the time of George Bush Snr's presidency and beyond. America's stance on the death penalty (now the only major executioner in the Western hemisphere), hostility to the International Criminal Court and resistance to controls over the international arms trade (Zimbabwe and the US were the only two countries to vote against a UN resolution on this last week), all go back years. Even \"extraordinary rendition\", probably thought of by most people as a quintessentially Bush II-era phenomenon, has its origins in the Clinton presidency. Over the formulation of new international treaties and safeguards, the US has often been on the wrong side of the argument, siding with countries that themselves had extremely poor human rights records.</p> <p>Meanwhile, on the other hand, the last years have also seen the US being strongly critical (rightly) of Burma and China on human rights grounds. There have been vocal voices within the present administration for international action over Darfur. (Ironically, though, the US's tarnished record in the \"war on terror\" has almost certainly weakened its ability to hold forth on topics where it has actually been in the right).</p> <p>Meanwhile, some of the more egregious aspects of America's own implementation of capital punishment (its use against child offenders or those with serious mental health problems) have been curtailed by the Supreme Court, with the government refraining from challenging these decisions. Again, just last week a federal court in the state of Florida convicted <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/31/liberia-us-emmanuel-trial\">Chuckie Taylor</a>, the son of Charles Taylor, Liberia's erstwhile president, for committing acts of torture in Liberia during the late 1990s. Like Taylor senior, currently awaiting trial for war crimes at the Hague, Chuckie faced justice according to the principle of \"international jurisdiction\", a principle once opposed by the US government but now apparently tacitly accepted in some instances. </p> <p>The United States, in other words, has \u2013 like dozens and dozens of other countries \u2013 a decidedly chequered history when it comes to human rights. Indeed, like our own, it has been highly selective about what to speak out about and what to turn a blind eye towards. </p> <p>Articulating these points has nothing to do with supposed anti-Americanism, the knee-jerk charge of those who would apparently hear nothing against the US. Instead, it is surely secret detention, torture and unfair trial that are contrary to the best traditions of America's founding fathers, its slavery abolitionists, civil rights activists and proud proponents of free speech and liberty.</p> <p>Whether the new president will stand up for these traditions in the next four years obviously remains to be seen.

In some areas of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/virginia\">Virginia</a> lines were forming from 4am, two hours before the polls opened.</p> <p>The Election Protection Coalition, an alliance of several voting-rights groups, collected reports of scattered difficulties at polling stations across the US. Tales of broken ballot scanners and touch-screen voting machines were particularly notable in the swing states of Virginia, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/pennsylvania\">Pennsylvania</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/ohio\">Ohio</a>.</p> <p>In Virginia, Ohio, and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/indiana\">Indiana</a>, legal skirmishes erupted over the method of counting provisional and absentee ballots, which could determine the margin of victory if the race remains close into the night.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama</a> began his day in Indiana, a once reliably <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/republicans\">Republican</a> state, where he is running neck and neck with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/johnmccain\">John McCain</a>. \"I think we can win in Indiana, otherwise I wouldn't be in Indiana,\" the Democrat said upon his arrival there.</p> <p>He told reporters that voting with his family \"was a big deal\", adding a quip: \"I noticed that Michelle took a long time, though. I had to check to see who she was voting for.\"</p> <p>In a bizarre twist, reporters waiting for Obama to appear at his local polling station instead spotted <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/oct/14/john-mccain-barack-obama-ayers-debate\">Bill Ayers</a>, the 1960s radical whose service on an education board with the Democrat has drawn relentless attacks from McCain. Now a college professor, Ayers lives in the same Chicago neighbourhood as Obama. He declined to answer questions about his vote.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/barackobama\">Obama</a> made <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/nov/04/uselections2008-barackobama\">his final appeal last night to a Virginia crowd</a> estimated at 90,000, while <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/johnmccain\">McCain</a> ended his election-eve sprint <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/nov/04/uselections2008-johnmccain\">in his home state of Arizona</a> at 3am.</p> <p>McCain appeared jubilant at an afternoon rally in Colorado, where he told supporters, \"Nothing is inevitable here. I feel momentum. I feel it, you feel it, and we are going to win this election.\"</p> <p>Most <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/interactive/2008/oct/03/uselections.polltracker.obama.mccain\">national and state polls</a> show the Democratic candidate poised for a decisive victory in the race to capture 270 of the 538 electoral votes required to take the White House.</p> <p>But Obama was making no confident predictions last night as he bade farewell to the reporters who have travelled with him for the past 22 months.</p> <p>\"OK, guys, let's go home. It will be fun to see how the story ends,\" Obama told the gathered press.</p> <p>McCain appeared comfortable with his <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/nov/04/mccain-obama-negative-campaigning\">underdog status</a>, insisting to CBS news this morning that there is \"a good scenario\" for him to snatch a shock victory. Yet that scenario would require the Republican to hold all the states won by George Bush in 2004 while unseating Obama in several where the Democrat currently leads.</p> <p>Republican vice-presidential candidate <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/sarahpalin\">Sarah Palin</a> returned to her hometown of Wasilla, Alaska, to cast her vote. \"I hope, pray, believe I will be able to wake up as vice-president-elect,\" she told reporters at her local polling station.</p> <p>Palin raised some eyebrows by declining to reveal whether she voted for Ted Stevens, her home-state Republican senator, who was convicted of criminal corruption last month and faces a likely defeat today. \"I don't have to tell anybody who I vote for,\" Palin said. \"Nobody does, and that's really cool about America, also.\"</p> <p>Her Democratic counterpart, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/joebiden\">Joe Biden</a>, voted near his Delaware home with his wife, Jill, before travelling to the battleground city of Richmond, Virginia.</p> <p>Obama plans to play a game of basketball, keeping to a voting-day tradition he began during the gruelling Democratic primary race, before joining Biden and their families for - if all goes to plan - a raucous victory party tonight in Chicago's Grant Park. McCain and his Republican team will watch the voters' verdict arrive from their home base in Phoenix.</p> <p>Officials are prepared for a record voter turnout, expecting as many as 140 million Americans to come out for Obama and McCain. The previous turnout high was 121 million voters, reached four years ago.</p> <p>Among the crowds casting votes in the New York suburbs were Hillary and Bill Clinton, who have enthusiastically campaigned for Obama this autumn after weeks of tension following the former first lady's Democratic primary loss.</p> <p>\"Our party tomorrow will wake up with an enormous opportunity but an enormous responsibility,\" the former president Bill Clinton told reporters outside his local polling station.</p> <p>Clinton claimed the presidency 16 years ago without reaching the 50% majority that most major polls have predicted Obama is poised to hit today. The last Democrat to achieve a 50% result was Jimmy Carter in 1976.</p> <p>One factor working in the electorate's favour was the weather, with most regions of the nation forecasting balmy temperatures that make queuing to vote a less unpleasant experience. The first polls in swing states close early evening in America, raising the possibility that the winner could be known before 2am GMT.</p> <p>Even in the capital city of Washington, where Obama could win as much as 90% of the vote, hundreds of people crowded the streets clutching cups of coffee as they waited to participate.</p>",
  "<p>When the ANC president, <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/d3e0a3da-a9f3-11dd-958b-000077b07658.html\">Jacob Zuma</a>,addressed a packed 20,000 crowd in Soweto on Saturday one of the preachers present evoked murmurs of assent when he said that \"Zuma has not been selected by the people only. Anyone who fights him is fighting Nkulunkulu (the Supreme Being) personally.\" </p> <p>In fact, Zuma's rally was one of a whole series of ANC gambits aimed at drawing attention away from the national convention organised in Johannesburg at the weekend by the ANC dissidents, led by Terror Lekota and Sam Shilowa, who are intent on launching a new party <a href=\"http://africa.reuters.com/wire/news/usnLN141839.html\">to compete with the ANC</a> in next April's general election. </p> <p>But the gambits failed: some 5,000 delegates packed the convention which was shrouded in one-nation euphoria as speakers from all races and parties were given a rapturous reception and the media gave it blanket coverage, all claiming that it had \"changed South African politics forever\".</p> <p>In the weeks before the convention, the various front organisations of the Communist party (the SACP) and in particular the various constituent unions of the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) has rained down denunciations of Lekota, Shilowa and anyone likely to support them, but this was merely an index of how thoroughly the SACP has colonised the Cosatu unions and the ANC itself \u2013 the SACP chairman, Gwede Mantashe, is now the ANC Secretary-General and the party's most forceful and frequent spokesman. But although the ANC is the party in possession \u2013 it has power, patronage, the symbols and history, the long-faithful voters \u2013 it has clearly been taken aback by the speed and degree to which the breakaway faction is developing. </p> <p>Lekota and his supporters now challenge the party head on in a way it is simply not used to: what is wrong with being middle class, Lekota asks? Do we all have to do what an SACP of only 20,000 members tells us ? Moreover, to Cosatu's considerable alarm, Willie Madisha, the former Cosatu chairman expelled for his refusal to back Zuma, is deep in talks to set up a new non-political labour federation which will doubtless entice many members away from Cosatu.</p> <p>South African politics has always been ethnic and regional. The convention's organisers showed their hand when they allocated 500 delegates each to the East, West and Northern Cape, the NorthWest and the Free State, for it is in these five provinces that they feel most confident of their support \u2013 indeed Lekota predicted to me that the ANC could no longer win any of them.<br> Only 300 delegates each were allocated to Mpumalanga, Limpopo and Gauteng (which includes Johannesburg) and only 200 to Zuma's home province of KwaZulu-Natal. Already, there are strong mutterings that Zuma's Zulu followers will make the latter a no-go area for the dissidents.</p> <p>What no one is saying is that the breakaway can only gain serious traction if it exploits tribal lines of cleavage. These are already evident: the three Cape provinces are predominantly Xhosa and it is clear that the dissidents will draw their principal support from this group, which feels dispossessed by the sight of a Xhosa President, Thabo Mbeki, being thrown out by a Zulu. Lekota himself is a South Sotho from the Free State and the Tswanas who populate the NorthWest are essentially just Western Sotho. At the convention Lekota spoke in English, Afrikaans \u2013 and Xhosa, for they were the dominant group: over a thousand delegates arrived from the Eastern Cape alone (despite the quota). This is the province where most Xhosas live and where the most confident predictions of dissident success are being made.</p> <p>Similarly, the key fact about Zuma's Soweto rally was that he spoke almost exclusively in Zulu: doubtless the language of most of the audience. Zulus are passionate about the notion that after three successive Xhosas \u2013 Tambo, Mandela and Mbeki \u2013 the Zulus, the biggest tribe, must provide the next ANC leader. It is this passionate enthusiasm which explains the invocations of the Almighty on Zuma's side.</p> <p>But this means massive violence, especially in ethnically mixed areas like Gauteng, for there is little doubt that the parties will seek to control \"their\" communities. No one is saying this yet. But we could well be in for a return to civil strife on a scale not witnessed since the early 1990s.</p>",
  "<p>In July 2007, the government set out its plans for 3m new homes by 2020 in the green paper <a href=\"http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/homesforfuture\">Homes for the future: more affordable, more sustainable</a>. In its latest report <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm/cmenvaud.htm\">Greener homes for the future?</a> the <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/parliamentary_committees/environmental_audit_committee.cfm\">Environmental Audit Committee</a> questioned whether the assumptions underpinning the targets, announced over 15 months ago, were still valid. The latest <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/nov/04/construction-housingmarket\">economic projections</a>, fundamental changes in the mortgage market, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/oct/31/house-prices-drop\">falling house prices</a> mean the government <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/nov/03/greenbuilding-ecotowns\">should urgently review</a> the assumptions on which the target was based. The government should ask the <a href=\"http://www.theccc.org.uk/\">Committee on Climate Change</a> to assess the impact housebuilding could have on carbon reduction targets. In reviewing its targets, the government must not dilute its environmental ambitions, but should invest in the skills and supply chains needed to deliver a step change in environmental construction standards.</p> <p>The government now has the opportunity to strengthen the environmental credentials of its housing policy. For example, the government's target for 3m new homes is split; 2m homes are to be built before the zero carbon target comes into effect in 2016, and 1m are to be built afterwards. Changing the balance, so that more homes are built after the zero carbon target comes into effect, could help to limit emissions from a growth in housing. The government could also accelerate the development of district renewable energy sources to ensure that new developments can source their heat and power from renewable sources. Instead of rating homes against the <a href=\"http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/england/professionals/en/1115314116927.html\">Code for Sustainable Homes</a>, the government could make it mandatory to build to aspects of the code from 2010 onwards. The government could place greater emphasis on energy efficiency and sustainability within the building control regime, and introduce higher penalties for developers who fail to meet energy efficiency standards.</p> <p>Good progress has been made on brownfield development, but pressure on greenfield sites is growing. Current policy, combined with high national housebuilding targets and current regional plans, could make it impossible for local authorities to prevent planning permission being granted for development on land that, because of the current economic situation, is not actually needed. Presented with an excess of available land, developers might develop greenfield sites in preference to brownfield sites. The government should ensure that an excess of land is not made available to developers and a clear sequential test in favour of brownfield development should be reintroduced into planning policy. </p> <p>The environmental tests used for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/ecotowns\">ecotowns</a> should be applied to all major housing developments from 2016. The government must ensure proposals for ecotowns have good public transport links, and are located close to commercial centres and employment opportunities. The government has recently devoted considerable attention to delivering the infrastructure for sustainable new communities. The government should ensure that minimum standards for public transport and green infrastructure apply to all new developments, not just ecotowns. </p> <p>The current economic crisis, with the implications it is likely to have for house prices and access to credit, means that a re-evaluation of housebuilding plans is urgently needed. This re-evaluation is an opportunity to make housing policy greener and move us along the path towards a low-carbon future.</p>",
  "<p>Promising action on youth violence is a home banker for a politician. Most of the electorate will agree that it sounds like a good idea. Most of them will also have their own ideas about what needs to be done. As an issue it has an immediacy and relevance that, say, tackling industrial waste or addressing health and safety breaches do not always have. Boris Johnson's new <a href=\"http://www.london.gov.uk/view_press_release.jsp?releaseid=19536\">action plan</a> on youth violence will therefore attract headlines and attention that an action plan on potholes or defective street lighting would never do.</p> <p>London is often compared with New York, not least because it is claimed to have the kind of effective policing that London apparently lacks. Yet in 2007 there were nearly 500 murder victims in New York, compared with 160 in London. The number of <a href=\"http://www.met.police.uk/crimefigures/index.php\">homicides in London</a> has also fallen in recent years, from a peak of over 200 in 2003. It is, in other words, important to keep the problem of violence in London in perspective.</p> <p>But it is also important not to dismiss the problem of violence out of hand. Admissions to accident and emergency wards for injuries caused by sharp implements rose nationally by 30% between 1997 and 2005, for instance. The number of young victims of homicide have also been rising in London. In 2007 over 30 children under the age of 17 were killed in London, around double the number for the preceeding two years. Overall, homicides in London are very unevenly spread across the capital. Lambeth, Southwark and Newham accounted for 46 alone in 2007. In Harrow, Richmond and Merton, by comparison, not a single murder was recorded.</p> <p>The rise in youth homicide in London, and the concentration of homicide in certain areas, against the background of falling overall homicide rates is therefore worrying. It means that some Londoners benefit from much greater levels of safety than others. In particular, those living in the capital's poorer neighbourhoods appear to be at much greater risk of homicide than those living in its leafier, richer, suburbs.</p> <p>In response to this problem the mayor is proposing a variety of initiatives with suitably portentous names. Project Daedalus will aim to improve education for young first-timers in prison while Project Brodie will tackle truancy. Project Titan will apparently build \"character\" by, if necessary, compelling young people to get involved in initiatives such as the Scouts, Army Cadets or the Duke of Edinburgh's Award scheme. Project Oracle will audit and evaluate charitable delivery in London.</p> <p>One suspects that the mayor's office spent almost as much time coming up with the buzzwords as they did with the content. There is little in the plan that is genuinely new or innovative. And though it acknowledges that \"child poverty is one of the fundamental issues at the heart of youth violence\", the plan completely ignores the implications of this observation. Perhaps the most breathtaking illustration of this comes in the mayor's foreword: \"There is more child poverty in London than anywhere else in Britain. But the real poverty is spiritual, emotional and intellectual\".</p>",

  "<p>More than 50 Labour MPs have issued a statement calling for a public debate on US plans to push ahead with a missile defence system using bases in the UK and Europe.</p> <p>The politicians, including Jon Cruddas and the former defence minister Peter Kilfoyle, issued the notice following a new poll that shows almost two thirds of people in the UK think the system would make the country less secure.</p> <p>According to the US military, the \"Son of Star Wars\" programme will create a defensive shield capable of shooting incoming missiles out of the sky, protecting the US and Europe from so-called \"rogue states\". </p> <p>However, critics say it is an unproven and aggressive military project that will destabilise international relations and create a new arms race.</p> <p>Kate Hudson, who chairs the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, said: \"Driving Europe into this throwback from the 1980s will give no security from the actual threats we face.

  "<p><strong>WENGER'S UNHAPPY FINISH IN SPECIAL SPA</strong></p> <p>The Fiver was reasonably surprised when, after Aaron Lennon scored Tottenham's fourth goal in that ridiculous shambles of a match at the Emirates last Wednesday, the normally emotional Arsene Wenger didn't run out of the stadium in tears, zigzagging down the Holloway Road windmilling his fists at innocent passers-by and putting the occasional shop window through. \"I am a bit angry,\" he instead simply sniffed, before walking off very slowly to a quiet dark room, closing the door gently, curling up into a ball and rocking back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. Mmmm, Arsene always feels relaxed in Arsene's Special Spa. Arsene loves it in Arsene's SpecAAARRRRGGGGHHial SpCLICHYYOUINEPTBASTaggghhhhh.</p> <p>Then a similar thing happened at the weekend, when Arsenal decided not to bother with the championship any more midway through a game at Stoke, and to add injury to injury, Theo Walcott and Emmanuel Adebayor both picked up body knack.

All the players have been injured deliberately.\" Arsene then went on to list all the other players he believes have been deliberately laid low by anti-aesthetes - Diaby, Rosicky, Eduardo, Sagna - before Pat Rice led him away to his Special Spa and advised him to stop thinking and do some rocking.</p> <p><em>Join Barry Glendenning for the Big Cup jamboree that is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/nov/04/championsleague-liverpool\">Liverpool 2-1 Atletico Madrid (with a late goal from $tevie Mbe)</a> at 7.15pm, when Rob Smyth will be cracking his knuckles ahead of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/nov/04/roma-chelsea-championsleague-mbmreport\">Chelsea's 1-0 win at Roma</a></em>.</p> <p>*********************</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"I am a Neapolitan and, as I have said several times, I'd like to return one day to Naples and finish my career there.

  "<p>Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the Iranian president, suffered a serious blow today when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/iran\">Iran</a>'s parliament sacked his interior minister after he was caught out with a badly faked law degree from Oxford University.</p> <p>Ali Kordan, a powerful figure on Iran's complex political scene, was told by the Iranian parliament, the Majlis, that he must face impeachment after he also admitted trying to bribe MPs not to proceed against him.</p> <p>The president's backing for the beleaguered minister until the eve of the vote has tarnished his reputation as a fighter against corruption.</p> <p>\"This is a serious setback to Ahmadinejad and a triumph for parliament,\" Sadegh Zibakalam, a Tehran University political scientist, told the Guardian. \"In the past he has treated this Majlis with contempt, or as a rubber stamp. This is a boost to its morale.\"</p> <p>Kordan's job included domestic security as well as organising next summer's presidential elections, when the hardline Ahmadinejad is expected to stand for a second term. The vote suggests the president's chances of winning again may be diminishing.</p> <p>Ali Larijani, the parliamentary speaker, said 188 deputies among the 247 present in the 290-member assembly voted to sack Kordan. \"The impeachment was approved by parliament and he cannot be interior minister from now on,\" he added.</p> <p>Kordan, a former revolutionary guard, accused the media of a smear campaign by portraying him as a \"terrorist,\" naming Israel Radio and Persian-language media based outside Iran. </p> <p>The Kordan saga began in August when parliament, which vets ministerial appointments, voted on his confirmation. When MPs questioned his eligibility he produced a certificate purporting to be an \"honorary doctorate of law\" from Oxford University and was approved by a slim margin.</p> <p>Within days Iranian journalists were following up claims that the degree was bogus. Kordan released a copy of the document to quell speculation. <br>But Alef, a website associated with one of Ahmadinejad's critics, pointed to typing errors, garbled English and misspellings, purportedly signed by three Oxford professors.</p> <p>The certificate commended Kordan for \"preparing educational materials\" and for \"research in the domain of comparative law that has opened a new chapter not only in our university but, to our knowledge, this country\". Alef passed the certificate to Oxford, which disavowed it. The Iranian government then blocked Alef's website from the internet.</p> <p>It also transpired later that Kordan did not receive a bachelor's degree or master's degree from Iran's Open University, as he had claimed.</p> <p>Ahmadinejad defended him by saying he should not be judged on a \"piece of torn paper\", a phrase he has used to dismiss UN resolutions against Iran's nuclear programme.</p> <p>One MP commented that the president could have won millions of votes by simply dismissing Kordan and that his support for the minister would cost him those votes next summer.</p> <p>\"Ahmadinejad is becoming more and more vulnerable,\" said commentator Saeed Leylaz. \"The vote showed that the prospect of winning the next election is dim for him.\" </p> <p>Ahmadinejad, president since 2005, is notorious in the west for his comments on Israel and the Nazi Holocaust. But most Iranians care more about the economic incompetence he has demonstrated in recent months.</p> <p>Declining oil revenues have exposed his populist spending plans and left the state coffers all but empty. In July he predicted oil prices would never fall below $100 per barrel. Prices today were around $63 a barrel. </p> <p>Last week the Tehran stock market plunged 12% to its lowest close in years. Inflation is estimated at 27% or more. </p> <p>Analysts and diplomats say a key question over the coming months will be the attitude of Iran's unelected supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who sits at the apex of the political system and has so far backed the president.</p> <h2>Ali Kordan joke box</h2> <p>A spoof \"Oxford\" dictionary circulating among Tehran university students lists the following entries:</p> <p><strong>Kordanize (v)</strong><br>1. To get a PhD without having a Bsc<br>2. To become an important person (eg. minister) by presenting fake certificate or documents</p> <p><strong>Kordanification (n)</strong><br>1.

  "<p>Remember the original Grand Theft Auto games on PC? Remember how the quaint top-down visuals somehow made the psychotic violence all the more shocking, like seeing Mario pull a shotgun on Luigi? Mobile developer <a href=\"http://www.tag-games.com/\">Tag Games</a> does, because Car Jack Streets is old skool GTA on a mobile handset. And actually Tag don't just remember GTA 1 and 2, they were there \u2013 the company's founders were mission designers at DMA Design, quitting during the 3D renaissance of the series. So this is authentic stuff \u2013 unlike the gamut of similar mini-GTA wannabes that have troubled the mobile sector over the past three or four years. </p> <p>Here's a <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=tZGwk-vnqEg\">YouTube trailer</a> to set the scene...<br><br>The narrative premise is simple: you're an inveterate gambler in debt to mafia hardnut, Frankie, to the tune of one million dollars. He wants his money back in daily installments and the only way you're going to get it is \u2013 ta da \u2013 by carrying out various missions for the city's criminal fraternity. One day that'll mean driving the getaway car at a bank job, the next it'll be hosing a rival gang with bullets or gatecrashing a major drug deal. And as usual, you can jack any passing vehicle you fancy from sports cars to buses and family saloons. There are only about five or six different vehicle types in the game, but you get used to it, and it sort of adds to the miniaturised charm.</p> <p>At the start of the game, you pick up a GPS device that guides you to each mission location via a teeny red arrow. This is sort of where things start going pear-shaped. There's no map display for proper route planning, and the section of road visible onscreen is pretty limited, so you'll often find yourself accelerating down dead ends. Controls are tricky too, especially in reverse, and the collision detection is horribly unforgiving so mission after mission will time out as you struggle with basic navigation and interface issues. Not a good game design feature.</p> <p>The roads are also incredibly narrow, allowing little margin for error when bombing from one mission to the next. And of course, with every squished pedestrian your criminal-o-meter rises, so you'll have cop cars whizzing after you, adding yet more pressure. It took me a whole flight from London to Rome to complete just one successful mission \u2013 and that was delivering a pizza. Yep, between criminal jobs it's possible to earn an honest wage driving busses and taxis and making deliveries. It's not thrilling, but hey, at least it doesn't involve you having to get out of the car and shoot at indiscriminate sprites that may or may not represent gangster enemies, passing pedestrian, police officers or the people you're meant to be protecting. </p> <p>There is one brilliant feature though. The game ties in with your real phone clock, so if you're given a mission that starts at 7pm, that means the real 7pm \u2013 if you're in an important meeting, or getting married, you'll need to make your excuses and leave. The visuals are also quite stylish, with lots of neat little features like the ability to knock fire hydrants over so they spray water everywhere, or to leave skid marks on pristine lawns. </p> <p>Car Jack Streets is an intermittently entertaining game, managing to produce the odd flash of true GTA anarchy, despite a control system that could reduce a saint to foul-mouthed frustration in less than ten minutes. It's interesting for its DMA/Rockstar heritage, especially to fans of the original Grand Theft Auto titles, but it's a little too flawed in execution to capture the imagination of occasional mobile gamers.</p> <p><em>Published by <a href=\"http://www.iplay.com/index.aspx?GEO=ROTW\">I-Play</a>.

  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Preamble:</strong> See that fresh-faced young whippersnapper hunkering down on his mark beside the scythe-wielding skeleton in the black cowl? That's Liverpool striker Fernando Torres, who's in a race against Time to be fit for Liverpool's encounter with his former team at Anfield tonight after suffering the customary bout of hamstring-twang that befalls him whenever he embarks on international duty for Spain. I hope he lines up for no other reason than that I like watching him play; there are few enough reasons to look forward to Champions League matches in the first group stages, what with Group D being just one of many in the competition that's as good as decided with three games to go.</p> <p>One man who'll definitely sit out tonight's encounter is Atletico coach Javier Aguirre, who begins a two-match touchline ban for some indiscretion or other. \"We want to play against a fully fit Fernando Torres so we can measure ourselves to see how we do against a full-strength Liverpool,\" he said. \"We have taken this competition so seriously and we have done very well up to now, but we can't appraise our success until the six games of the first phase have been completed.\" Atletico currently sit joint top of their group with Liverpool on seven points after three games, PSV are next with three, while Marseille have none.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Team news:</strong> The scythe-wielding skeleton in the black cowl breasted the tape first - Torres isn't even on the bench. </p> <p><strong>Liverpool:</strong> Reina, Arbeloa, Carragher, Agger, Aurelio,<br>Mascherano, Alonso, Kuyt, Gerrard, Riera, Keane. <br><strong>Subs:</strong> Cavalieri, Dossena, Benayoun, Babel, Leiva Lucas, Ngog, Degen.</p> <p><strong>Atletico Madrid: </strong>Franco, Antonio Lopez, Perea, Heitinga,<br>Pernia, Raul Garcia, Paulo Assuncao, Maniche, Maxi, Forlan, Simao. <br><strong>Subs:</strong> Coupet, Luis Garcia, Aguero, Sinama Pongolle,<br>Banega, Pablo, Camacho.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>1 min:</strong> The teams emerge from the dug-out, with by far and away the majority of them exchanging pleasantries in Spanish considering all the Spaniards, Argentinians, Uruguayans and what not involved. Despite Fernando Torres' absence, Liverpool's team contains more actual Spaniards than Atletico's, with Robbie Keane being the lone English-speaker in both sides. The funny thing is that his native language is actually Irish. Confused? Good. <br>Atletico, who have left Sergio Aguera on their bench in order to facilitate an extra midfielder, kick off.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>2 min:</strong> A corner for Liverpool results in a close shave for Atletico - Agger appeals for a penalty after being denied a clean shot on goal by Simao. He thought he'd been fouled, but the referee didn't agree.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>3 min:</strong> Pernia attempts to cross from the left for Diego Forlan, but his effort is blocked. Moments later, Maxi Rodriguez tries to cross from the other flank, but his delivery is headed clear. This match has started at a cracking pace.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>5 min:</strong> Replays of that incident where Agger thought he should have got a penalty are inconclusive. The camera pans to Fernando Torres, who is sitting in the stand with an open-necked shirt, pullover and anorak type thing. Flash git!</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>7 mins:</strong> \"Dear Fiver and tonight's MBMers,\" writes Tom Chivers. \"Regarding your always-amusing 'Follow Chelsea's laboured 1-0 win over whomever etc' lines in the Fiver: I've always wondered whether, if one consistently put money on your tips, one would actually turn a profit. To that end I've stuck a fiver (appropriately enough) on each of tonight's MBMs - a 2-1 win for the Pool and 0-1 for Chelsea, as augured. In the spirit of scientific enquiry I'm setting up a time-limited experiment - I'll do this to the end of the group stages on all the English teams' games (total \u00a360) and see whether I'm plus or minus on the deal. My financial future is now in your hands.\" </p> <p>Well, far be it from me to tell you how to spend your money, Tom, but do the words \"credit\" and \"crunch\" mean anything to you? That said, it's probably less risky giving your money to the money-grabbing gits at Ladbroke's or Coral than the even more avaricious ones at Bradford &amp; Bingley or Lloyds.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>11 min:</strong> Liverpool win a corner, which Steven Gerrard sends in to the box. Atletico's Argentinian goalkeeper Leo Franco clears with a less than inspired punch.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>13 min:</strong> \"Granted he wielded a scythe, but Old Father Time is usually portrayed as a genial old fellow rather than the cowled skellington of Death,\" writes Steve Gaw. \"But rather than being pedantic and after casting my vote for Obama this morning, I have much more important issues to follow on this historic day: two hours of meaningless Group D action interspersed with high-class banter from Gary Naylor.\"</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>14 min:</strong> Robbie Keane controls a wonderful 50-yard diagonal ball pass from Xabi Alonso with his chest, then shoots into the side-netting from 20 yards. Excellent pass, excellent control and a good effort.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>16 min:</strong> Robbie Keane is not the only person on the Liverpool team who speaks English as his first language,\" writes Chad Biedle-Baker in New York. \"What about Steven Gerrard and Jamie Carra ... oh.\"</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>18 min:</strong> With the home fans booing with the kind of self-righteous sanctimony that they do so well, Atletico embark on a lightning-fast counter-attack while a Liveprool player goes to ground with a minor injury after a rather blatant Atletico handball. The ball is crossed from the left to Simao, who blasts it high over the cross-bar from seven or eight yards with only the goalkeeper, Reina, to beat. His reaction is one of acute embarrassment and rightfully so.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>22 min:</strong> \"Regarding Tom Chivers's email at seven minutes: is this the first time someone has had the same email published in two MBMs at the same time?\" asks Philip Smith, who appears to be labouring under the delusion that I read minute-by-minute reports that I'm not writing. \"Also, am I correct in saying that you're getting considerably more emails than Rob Smyth, who was able to print Tom's missive before his match had even started? Or is it just because you don't read your emails as much?\"</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>24 min:</strong> Xabi Alonso pings an inch-perfect diagonal pass towards the far post, where Riera just fails to make decent contact under pressure from Antonio Lopez.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>26 min:</strong> \"I can go down to the fitness center and ask them to switch to ESPN2 (from some meaningless early election coverage on CNN) so I can watch the match, or I can stay in my office pretending to work and follow the match via MBM,\" writes Joe Pearson. \"Your recommendation?\" </p> <p>If you're sitting in the office when you don't have to be there, my recommendation is that you go out for a drink or go home. It doesn't matter who wins this match because both teams are going to go through to the second round whatever the outcome tonight. I remember a time, many years ago, when exciting European Cup matches were the rule, not the exception.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>28 min:</strong> Liverpool midfielder Javier Mascherano curls a cross into the penalty area which Dirk Kuyt flings himself at headfirst and misses.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>30 min:</strong> \"According to today's <a href=\"http://football.theguardian.com/fiver/0,,415657,00.html\">Fiver</a>, Modena have employed a Benedictine monk to banish their poor form withy an exorcism,\" writes Justin Kavanagh. \"Why can't Liverpool get an exorcist to lift their league curse? They already have a rotating head coach and at least two local lads speakin' in tongues, la?!\"</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>32 min:</strong> It's all Liverpool here. Riera sends a marvellous delivery into the Atletico box, Steven Gerrard controls well and is denied what looks a certain goal by the crucial intervention of Luis Perea. Moments later, Robbie Keane is foiled in his attempts to put Liverpool one up by some good goalkeeping when Leo Franco rushes off his line to intercept a through-ball which the Irishman was attempting to latch on to.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>34 min:</strong> Liverpool turn the screw. Mascherano crosses from the right, but Atletico left-back Perea hoofs clear.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Liverpool 0 - 1 Atletico Madrid (Maxi 37)</strong> That's a cracking goal on the counter-attack. Atletico centre-back Hettinga sent a long ball up towards the right wing, where gallloping full-back Antonio Lopez picked it up. He cut inside and played a short pass to Maxi, who pushed the ball past a defender with his first touch and rifled an unstoppable diagonal drive across the face of goal and inside the far post with his second.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>41 min:</strong> Interestingly, when the goal went in, the camera they're using to monitor Atletico old boy Fernando Torres in the stands showed him leaping to his feet and throwing his arms around his not unattractive lady companion before flicking Vs at the occupants of the Kop and ripping open his parka to reveal an Atletico Madrid shirt*.</p> <p>*None of the above is true. He remained completley impassive.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>44 min:</strong> Steven Gerrard tries several shots from distance, none of which come within an ass's roar of troubling the goalkeeper.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>45 min:</strong> There have been no injuries or substitutions in what was a half of football played at a very high tempo, but that hasn't stopped the fourth official holding up an electronic board with a big orange '1' on it.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>Half-time</strong></p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>Tom Chivers credit crunch gambling update:</strong> \"Roma 1-0 Chelsea. Well, that's not ideal, is it?\" he says. \"I may be staring at a life of debasing myself for the entertainment of German businessmen in exchange for food.\" May be? You almost certainly will be, Tom, once the Fiver starts predicting prepoterous 156-75 scorelines for the remaining matches involving English teams in the Champions League group stages, just to see you lose your hard-earned cash. Still, if one of them actually comes in, you'll never have to debase yourself in front of German businessmen again.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>Oh dear:</strong> Despite the efforts of in-no-way made-up reader Chad Biedle-Baker taking the trouble to explain my opening joke about the number of English speakers in the Liverpool team, this has come in from Tom, whose surname I've decided not to include in order to spare his embarrassment. \"So Jamie Carragher and Stevie Gerrard are Scousers and not native English speakers?\" he asks, probably indignantly.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>45 min:</strong> Tip, tap, roll, hoof! Liverpool get the second half under way. They're playing into the Kop end in the second half, which is how they like it.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>48 min:</strong> Alonso dinks the ball into the edge of the six-yard box, where Robbie Keane is waiting to swivel and volley it goalwards. Hettinga does well to get back and make a nuisance of himself by getting in the way.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>49 min:</strong> It's all going pear-shaped for Chelsea and Tom Chivers. The defending runners-up are 2-0 down against a terrible Roma side.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>49 min:</strong> Robbie Keane and thousands of Koppites appeal for a penalty when Perea handles inside the six-yard box. The referee was blindsided and couldn't see the baltant handball and the linesman didn't flag to drasw his attention to it. It should have been a penalty, but Atletico Madrid get away with it.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>51 min:</strong> It's all Liverpool in this half, much as it was in the first. With the ball at his feet just outside the penalty area, Xabi Alonso moves to dink the ball over the defence, but with several of his team-mates standing in offside positions, his options are very limited. Atletico clear.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>53 min:</strong> Atletico defender Perea must have signed some sort of Faustian pact with the devil before tonight's game*. He's playing out of his skin and should have conceded a penalty but didn't. Now the ball quite clearly goes out off his foot for a corner and the referee signals for a goal-kick. Liverpool are getting well and truly mugged here.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>55 min:</strong> Liverpool win a free-kick for handball in the Atletico left-back position, even though the ball hit Pernia on the chest. Gerrard curls the ball into the penalty area, where Daniel Agger heads over the bar.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>57 min:</strong> \"Are the minute-by-minute reports only read by people living in the United States?\" asks Scott White. \"I'm an English guy stuck in an office in New York and it seems I'm not alone.\" Well Scott, it's hardly surprising everyone in the US is reading my report, because it's not as if there's much else of interest going on in the United States tonight.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>60 min:</strong> Before Tom whose surname I won't include in a bid to spare him embarrassment writes in to set me straight, I should add that I am aware there is a US presidential election on tonight. I hope that Dubya, who has done a marvellous job as leader of the free world, gets elected for a third term, if only to see how much gas there is left in that particular explosion.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>65 min:</strong> Liverpool appear to have gone close through Gerrard, Agger and Kuyt, but I'd be lying I said my head hadn't been turned, literally to the left, by the sight of Chelsea going 3-0 against Roma. Back in the match I'm supposed to be watching, Steven Gerrard has a pop from distance that fizzes wide.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>66 min:</strong> Corner for Liverpool, who are dominating proceedings but continue to look vulnerable to the counter-attacks. Nothing comes of it and Atletico clear. A few minutes ago, Liverpool brought on Babel for Riera. Shortly afterwards, Maniche picked up the first yellow card of the night for a clumsy challenge.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>70 min:</strong> Spellbinding play from Liverpool in general and Steven Gerrard in particular, who eviscerate the Atletico defence with a series of mesmerising one-twos, leaving Gerrard with a clear sight of goal from about 10 yards. Instead of smashing the ball padt Franco, he attempts to place it and sidefoots wide. Liverpool substitution: a most displeased Robbie Keane off, Ngog on. Atletico Madrid substitution: Sergio \"Kun\" Aguero on, Diego Forlan off. Elsewhere in this group, Marseille are beating PSV 3-0, which means that if Atletico can hold on here tonight, they'll be through to the last 16 with two matches still to play. That's a ridiculous state of affairs - the format of this tournament needs to be changed.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>75 min:</strong> Great block from Jamie Carragher , who blocks a low Maniche cross that was heading straight for the waiting Kun. Maniche appealed for a penalty after the ball struck the defender's arm, but it was very much ball to arm, off his knee, so there was no foul there. </p> <p>\"Barry, I'm also stuck in an office in the US, and the fact that Chelsea are losing 3-0 is giving me almost as much pleasure as the thought of the Republicans losing tonight,\" writes Nathan Smith. \"Every single American I know over here, without exception, is voting for Obama. Who said they were stupid?\" </p> <p>You mean every single American you know over there <em>says</em> they're voting for Obama, writes your cynical minute-by-minute reporter. Whether they actually do or not remains to be seen. While I'm raining on your parade, I should probably tell you that Chelsea have pulled a goal back.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>82 min:</strong> Great skill from Ngog, who does brilliantly to keep the ball from going wide while simultaneously beating a defender with a rinky-dink soft-shoe shuffle on the goal-line. From an impossible angle, he attempts to beat Leo Franco at his near post when he should have crossed for Kuyt. Corner for Liverpool, from which Agger should have scored with a header, but somehow contrived to put wide.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>84 min:</strong> Agger falls under a challenge from Maniche, dislocates his finger and jogs over to the sideline where the physio yanks it back into place. Ouch!</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>85 min:</strong> Liverpool have five minutes to avoid their first European defeat at Anfield since Marseille beat them 13 months ago. The last time they lost any sort of competitive match was against Barnsley in last season's FA Cup. Jamie Carragher, of all people, tries a shot from distance, which brings a smart save out of Franco. Stat attack: shots on target: Liverpool 17 - 6 Atletico Madrid. This is like Saturday's game against Spurs all over again - Liverpool are mullering their opposition but still on the verge of defeat.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>87 min:</strong> \"Time for heroes,\" says ITV commentator Peter Drury. Quite how he thinks an American science fiction television drama series created by Tim Kring, which premiered on NBC on September 25, 2006 is going to help Liverpool's cause is anyone's guess. Atletico substitution: Simao off, Liverpool old boy Luis Garcia on to warm applause.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>90 min:</strong> From deep, Gerrard curls a marvellous ball from right to left across the edge of the six-yard box. Ngog makes a fairly half-hearted attempt to get on the end of it, but seems cowed by Hettinga's challenge. Atletico clear.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>90+3min:</strong> You couldn't make it up. Steven Gerrard jumps into Pernia to contest a header, falls to the ground, twisting theatrically on his way, and is awarded a penalty.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Liverpool 1-1 Atletico Madrid (Gerrard 90+5pen)</strong> Gerrard places the ball and blasts it past Franco, who dives the wrong way. It's one of the strangest decisions I've ever seen - if anyone should have been penalised it was Gerrard, for jumping into the back of Pernia, but he ended up winning a penalty and the Atletico defender got booked. Yet another referee bottles it in front of the Kop, giving its occupants a reason to feel even more pleased with themselves than usual.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>90+7 min:</strong> Atletico show no inclination to kick off after the goal. Hettinga gets booked for complaining about the penalty, then stands with his hands on his hips nodding slowly and repeatedly at the referee as he's shown the yellow card. He is <em>oozing</em> contempt for the official. Seconds later, Aguera gets booked for booting the ball over the bar from the spot in centre-circle by way of a kick-off. Is that even a foul? I don't think so.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>90+8 min:</strong> The referee, who is mentally unravelling before our very eyes, awards a free-kick to Liverpool on the halfway line, lets them take it and then brings the game to a close. Liverpool have got away with a draw after winning a penalty they did not deserve. However, seeing as they were denied one they did deserve earlier in the game, it's probably a fair result.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>Group D:</strong> With each team having played four games in Group D, Liverpool and Atletico both have eight points. Marseille and PSV have three each after the Dutch side lost 3-0 at the hands of their French hosts. Barring some astonishing results, both Liverpool and Atletico Madrid will get through to the last 16.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>Last word tonight </strong>goes to Becky Barrett, who is very happy. \"I'm also an American following the MBM, and I actually <em>did</em> vote for Obama this morning after standing in line for 90 minutes. I only prayed for two things this week ... for Chelsea to be spanked and McCain to lose in embarassing fashion. One down, one to go ...\"</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>Actually it goes to me. </strong>Y ou <em>say</em> you pulled the lever with the big picture of Obama on it, Becky, but how do you know the vote didn't actually go to McCain? This is Amercia, we're talking about, after all. Jesus, if you live in Florida your vote could have gone anywhere.</p>",

  "<p>Ministers fear that a defeat for Labour in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/glenrothes\">Glenrothes byelection</a> on Thursday will \"encourage\" David Cameron to believe the government's resurgence is over, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/harrietharman\">Harriet Harman</a> has told the Guardian.</p> <p>The leader of the Commons was campaigning in the Fife constituency today as Labour made a last-ditch effort to rally supporters and voters, but she was guarded about Labour's chances of retaining the seat.</p> <p>With bookies and pundits now suggesting the Scottish National party is edging closer to victory on Thursday, Harman insisted that Labour was fighting a very strong campaign.</p> <p>However, she played down the significance of a second SNP byelection win over Labour this year, after the nationalists overturned a 13,500-vote majority to take Glasgow East in July. </p> <p>Labour's chief concern was not doing something \"which will encourage David Cameron,\" she said. \"Obviously the SNP won't form the next government, so we don't want any satisfaction delivered to David Cameron with the result here.\"</p> <p>She said she had experienced \"quite a lot of positive tribal loyalty and local loyalty\" for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/gordonbrown\">Gordon Brown</a>. There had been \"quite a lot of support for Gordon, but I think it's too close to call really.\"</p> <p>David Mundell, the Conservative shadow secretary of state for Scotland, said Harman's remarks confirmed his belief that voters were turning to a \"resurgent\" Tory party under Cameron.</p> <p>\"There's no doubt Labour are struggling on the doorsteps. This is a reality check for them that Gordon Brown isn't some form of Superman,\" he said.</p> <p>\"People are still very unhappy with the government over its performance on the economy, over issues like post office closures and transport in Fife. It's clear that Thursday's result isn't going to be a ringing endorsement of the Labour government.\"</p> <p>The SNP were initially strong favourites to win the seat, held by Labour with a 10,664 majority in 2005, but Labour ministers believe the \"Brown bounce\" following the prime minister's strong performance during the financial crisis has left the contest neck and neck.</p> <p>The bookmakers have shortened the odds on a victory for the SNP, who have redeployed their \"yes we can\" slogan from the 1997 general election campaign, and senior Labour figures are understood to be increasingly nervous about holding the seat.</p> <p>John Prescott, now effectively retired from frontline politics after stepping down as deputy prime minister, is due in the constituency tomorrow.</p> <p>The SNP are continuing to focus on rising energy prices and living costs, and benefiting from anxieties in the constituency over the threat of 20,000 job losses with the merger of HBOS with Lloyds TSB and possible post office branch closures.</p> <p>Yesterday's decision to grant US businessman Donald Trump permission for his \u00a31bn golf resort near Aberdeen, which Alex Salmond claims will create up to 6,000 jobs, may also have boosted the SNP's standing.</p> <p>Harman, who was the deputy Labour leader until the last reshuffle, confirmed that voters were \"really concerned\" about their job prospects and fuel costs, but said they knew Brown was the strongest and most effective leader the country had. </p> <p>\"They want someone who sorts the situation out,\" she said. \"I think there's a strong sense in the parliamentary Labour party now that Gordon is a round peg in a round hole,\" she said. \"We're in a difficult situation and thank goodness we know what's he's doing in charge. That's the way people are thinking.\" </p> <p>Harman said Labour's candidate, Lindsay Roy, the widely-respected headteacher of Brown's old high school in Kirkcaldy, was proving himself to be very popular on the doorstep. Roy is \"something of a local celebrity himself, there's no doubt about that,\" she said.</p>",

Or Barcelona, Arsenal and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mf-od48IfkI)\">Gabriel Batitstuta</a> a year later?), the first and now only Champions League group stage really is a complete waste of space: a mind-numbing combination of familiarity and formality. For Chelsea in particular, it has become no more demanding than being asked to write their name on the sheet for the last 16.</p> <p>Here's how easy the Champions League group stages are for Chelsea. They haven't conceded a goal for 711 minutes, since David Villa scored in the Mestralia in October 2007; they've only conceded one home goal since September 2004; and they haven't lost a truly live game since November 2005*. </p> <p>If they win tonight \u2013 and they should against a Roma side who have lost five in a row - they will qualify for the knockout stages.

It has been pouring down in Rome, to the point where there were genuine doubts over whether the match would start, but it's okay for now. It's stopped raining, but conditions are seriously slippy-sloppy.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>2 min</strong> No incidents of note thus far. \"The first goal could be so important tonight,\" says Clive Tyldesley, dealing unusually in inanity.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>4 min</strong> Some decent possession for Roma but it amounts to mild pleasantries rather than an attempt to engage and then overpower Chelsea in conversation.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>6 min</strong> \"After the US elections are over, Champions League group stages are what will get me through two hours a day at work,\" says productivity's Andrew Corcoran. \"Instead of constantly refreshing political websites, two days a week for two weeks I get to refresh minute-by-minute reports of games.

It's been a remarkably low-key start, either cagey, apathetic or both, and barely distinguishable from a pre-season friendly.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>9 min</strong> \"Hey, Rob, it's me, Damien,\" says Damien Neva, ominously. \"Have you listened to any of the GLC today? I haven't, but if EBJT scores tonight, then I'm going to crank up 'Half Man etc &amp; So On'.\" I think of that song every time I watch an almost context-free CL group game. What does it mean, what does it meaaaaan?</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>10 min</strong> That's better. Deco zig-zags infield and slaps one almost absent-mindedly towards the bottom-left corner from 25 yards. Doni dives to his right to palm it wide.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>12 min</strong> Roma are hopeless. They're not helped by a palpably nervous atmosphere, but they can barely string two passes together. This is Chelsea's as and when they want it.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>14 min</strong> Smart effort from Vucinic. There was some pinball on the edge of the box, and then he took it on his chest and hooked a volley over Cech but also a few yards over the bar.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>15 min</strong> \"Hey,\" heys Grant Newdick, \"can you say hi to my mate Nick Yiannoutsos? He's sitting across the room for me busy at work while we're both logged in to MBM in NZ. It's 8.57 here in New Zealand! Although he's a Norwich fan he does have money on Chelsea.\" Hello Nick.

He takes one touch to control as he opens his body up and then crunches it low towards the near post. I think it was going a fraction wide, but Doni made sure anyway.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>24 min</strong> Worst. Pun. Ever. From. Jeremy.

Oh.\" What, did he Tango-slap you or something?</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>33 min</strong> Deco is booked for a needlessly cynical trip on Totti just clear of the centre-circle.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Roma 1-0 Chelsea (Panucci 34)</strong> What a preposterously simple goal. Roma had a free-kick 45 yards out; Pizarro passed it wide to the unmarked Cicinho, and he just whipped it across the face for Panucci to sidefoot past Cech with all of Chelsea's defenders just standing still eight yards out. Maybe they were as bored as the rest of us, but that really was staggeringly negligent defending, and - and you'll like this - it looks like it was John Terry who let Panucci run off him.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>37 min</strong> That really was a weird goal, the sort where you expect a whistle when you see the defenders stop. But there was absolutely no issue of offside, because Panucci came from well behind the cross.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>39 min</strong> Inevitably the goal changes the mood, as much in the stands as anything, and Roma have fed off that to enjoy a decent spell of mild pressure. But it's still a seriously listless contest.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>40 min</strong> Liverpool are 1-0 down at home to Atletico Madrid, thanks to Maxi Rodriguez. These results aren't without significance: Liverpool and Chelsea are still going through - there's nowt surer - but at this rate they won't be going through tonight, which means they won't be able to rest players for the fifth game.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>41 min</strong> A simply majestic first-time pass from Mikel allows Malouda to charge down the inside-left channel on the counter. He runs 40 yards to the edge of the box but then, with Cole and Lampard in good positions, whizzes one high and wide of the near post. Pathetic.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>42 min</strong> \"Roma 1-0 Chelsea: well, that's not ideal, is it?\" says Tom Chivers, showing a delicious grasp of the bleedin' obvious. \"I may be staring at a life of debasing myself for the entertainment of German businessmen in exchange for food.\"</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>44 min</strong> Joe Cole comes within a stud's end of conceding a pointless penalty. Pizarro gave Cole a taste of his own medicine with a trick on the left corner of the box and Cole, sticking out a foot, scraped <em>this</em> much of a stud on the ball as Pizarro went over. The appeals were surprisingly muted, and the referee hardly gave it a second look, but on balance I think we got the correct decision in the end.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>Half time: Roma 1-0 Chelsea</strong> A desperate, listless half, illuminated only by a vaguely shambolic goal for Panucci. Chelsea have been the better team, but the fact that they don't <em>need</em> to win has been all too obvious in their mincing around in the final third. See you in 15 minutes.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>46 min</strong> Chelsea have made a double substitution - Belletti and Drogba on for Malouda and Joe Cole - which suggests a possible Scolari funk, and a tactical switch to 4-4-2.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>47 min</strong> \"Are the MBMs only read by people living in the US?\" asks Scott White. \"I'm an English guy stuck in an office in New York and it seems I'm not alone.\" It's a pleasant surprise to hear that they're read by <em>anyone</em>, so I'm certainly not going to complain about them only being read in the <em>fourth most important country in the world</em>.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>47 min 02 secs</strong> Deco has gone to the left and Belletti right in an orthodox 4-4-2, although you suspect Deco will float like a butterfly when the mood takes. Decent start for Chelsea, possession-wise, and I'm putting all of Tom Chivers' pennies on the fact that they took a hairdryer at half-time.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Roma 2-0 Chelsea (Vucinic 48)</strong> That's a lovely goal. Brighi danced almost daintily infield from the left and then, with a load of bodies around him on the edge of the box, just touched it a few yards across the face of the box for Vucinic, who hit right through it, sending it swooshing sweetly away from Cech and into the far right corner.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>50 min</strong> \"A largely meaningless match, played out purely for money in front of a billionaire owner on an ego trip, to a largely indifferent television audience who aren't sure if \"their\" team represent England or not,\" dotdotdots Gary Naylor. \"Not last Saturday's Stanford match, tonight's Chelsea match.\"</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>52 min</strong> Chelsea have paid the price for what was an understandable if ultimately unacceptable lack of oomph at a time when the game was there for the taking. \"Scott White is not alone,\" says Justin Kavanagh. \"I'm reading the MBM in Washington D.C., where half my office hasn't even shown up for work today.

Deco hits the wall.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Roma 3-0 Chelsea (Vucinic 58)</strong> How on earth has this happened? Mikel lost the ball halfway inside the Roma half to Vucinic, who simply bustled all the way down the inside-left channel - not especially quickly, either - held off Mikel's retaliatory challenge on the edge of the box, and sidefooted it past Cech at the near post.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>60 min</strong> \"Thanks for clearing that one (52 min) up, Rob, and I thought Americans lacked irony!\" says Justin Kavanagh, emphatically getting the joke.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>61 min</strong> There's a wee bt of crowd trouble apparently. In Roma? With their police? Who knew?!</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>62 min</strong> Deco, already on a yellow card, gets away with a putting a foot malevolently between Pizarro's legs. There's absolutely no question that he should have walked for that.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>63 min</strong> With the game won, Julio Baptista comes on for Totti.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>64 min</strong> Chelsea substitution: Kalou for Bosingwa, which means Belletti to right back and Kalou to right wing.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>65 min</strong> Chelsea are still having all the possession, but that absolutely suits Roma, who can just sit in and work them on the counter. What a bizarre game this has been: for 30 minutes Roma were laid bare, awaiting their punishment. But Chelsea showed a strange reluctance to move in for the kill, and then Roma got an Andrex-soft goal. After that, the game changed completely.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>66 min</strong> Scolari's Chelsea are flat-track bullies. Discuss.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>67 min</strong> Drogba coaxes a free-kick straight into Doni's arms. Since Kalou's introduction Chelsea have gone back to 4-3-3, with Kalou (right) and Anelka (left) flanking Drogba and the usual suspects in midfield: Mikel, Deco and Lampard.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>70 min</strong> \"Would <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/apr/12/championsleague200607.championsleague1\">7-1</a> be too much to ask for...?\" wonders Ian McLeish. I think that's unrealistic: there's no way Chelsea are going to score here.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>71 min</strong>Drogba, justly flagged offside, goes round Doni and hits the post anyway. Chelsea really have made an unbelievable balls-up of this through what really amounts to a lack of professionalism. It was all tippy-tappy around the Roma box at a stage in the game when Roma were mentally so vulnerable.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>73 min</strong> Roma substitution: Taddei on for Stoke-on-Trent's finest: the Potteries Shopping Cent- sorryu, I mean Simone Perrotta.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>74 min</strong> Roma, in a sense, are as guiltily of sloppiness now as Chelsea were in the first half. If they really, really concentrated on the counter-attack, they could get four or five here. But they don't need to and it shows in the imprecision of their final pass.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Roma 3-1 Chelsea (Terry 75)</strong> John Terry continues his unhappy habit of scoring in <em>every Champions League game except the final</em>. It came from a corner on the left. Deco burst infield and cracked it towards goal. It hit Terry six yards out, probably on the arm, and prompted a fine save from Doni. The ball came back to Terry, who stood and thought about things for a few seconds before deciding - why the eff not - to dump the ball in the open net.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>77 min</strong> Here's Scott Dustan. \"12 min 'Roma are hopeless. They're not helped by a palpably nervous atmosphere, but they can barely string two passes together. This is Chelsea's as and when they want it'; 70 min ...'there's no way Chelsea are going to score here'. Are you on medication for your split personality...?\" Yes. Booze. The absurd thing is is that both were correct.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>79 min</strong> \"Flat-track bullies is a little harsh, I feel,\" says Dave Bell. \"Against better-than-average opposition and in the formations they favour, Chelsea are going to sorely miss Essien - Mikel is a good player but nowhere near the same class. In other news, did you Atletico were at 5-1 earlier on today to beat Liverpool this evening?\" No <em>way</em>. I agree, incidentally, that Essien (and also Drogba) make them a much better side, and one capable of coping on all terrains.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>80 min: DECO SENT OFF FOR TAKING A FREE-KICK</strong> An utter farce. Seriously. Deco, on a yellow card, took a quick free-kick down the right, and he got a second yellow for the heinous crime of trying to show imagination and take advantage of an offence committed against his side. Deco actually should have gone earlier but two wrongs don't make a right and that is an utter, sorry, sick joke.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>83 min</strong> Roma were starting to lose their nerve a bit at 1-3, 11-11, but now they have eased themselves back into the box seat, even though a justly piqued Chelsea continue to have all the ball.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>84 min</strong> \"We will be relocating to our new office at 55 Baker Street on Monday 24th November,\" says Tim Collyer. \"Gull details coming soon.\" He also made a point about Chelsea not being flat-track bullies but tactically na\u00efve and the squad never rotated. But I preferred the first bit.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>86 min</strong> Good chance for De Rossi on the counter. It was made by a lovely first-time pass from Julio Baptista, in behind the defence on the right for Cicinho. He clipped a cross to the near post where De Rossi, unmarked but on the stretch, couldn't control his volley.</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>88 min</strong> De Rossi lifts a lazy ball in behind the defence and Vucinic, one on one at the corner of the six-yard box, is denied by a sprawling save from Cech. That's his last contribution: he's replaced by John Arne Riise. Insert your own joke here.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>89 min</strong> \"Deco? Ha!\" says Gary Naylor. \"A walking red card in a beaten side. For every one he does get, there's half a dozen he should get but doesn't. He's 31 and should grow up.\" I'm 32 but I take your poi- oh hang on, yeah exactly. Great point.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>Full time: Roma 3-1 Chelsea</strong> A really peculiar game of football. Chelsea were so, so comfortable at the start against an angst-ridden Roma, but they were <em>too</em> comfortable and gifted a cheap goal to give Roma belief and impetus. Two from the excellent Vucinic just after half-time made it 3-0 and, despite a dodgy goal from John Terry, Chelsea never looked likely to get back into it, not least because Deco was sent off in farcical circumstances. Chelsea suddenly have a slight battle on to qualify from this group. Who knew?</p>",
  "<p>The activities of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc\">BBC</a>'s commercial arm, BBC Worldwide, came in for criticism from rival media companies today, with one executive branding it an \"out-of-control juggernaut\".</p> <p>MPs on the House of Commons culture, media and sport select committee heard executives from the BBC's commercial rivals claim BBC Worldwide was moving into areas not covered by its remit and calling for it to come under closer scrutiny.</p> <p>Lyn Hughes, the editor and publisher of independent travel magazine Wanderlust, questioned BBC Worldwide's plans to launch a Lonely Planet travel magazines in a time of economic downturn when travel companies are going to the wall.</p> <p>The BBC bought a stake in Lonely Planet last year for \u00a389.9m and plans to launch a travel magazine in the coming weeks.</p> <p>Hughes also accused the corporation of deliberately targeting her advertisers and said that BBC Worldwide was an \"out-of-control juggernaut\".</p> <p>\"Why is the BBC launching one at the worst possible time? I can only think they're smug. They don't need to make money,\" she added.</p> <p>The Time Out chairman, Tony Elliott, criticised moves by BBC Worldwide into areas that he believed fell outside its public service remit.</p> <p>\"When they take quantum leaps into areas which have nothing to do with the BBC as a broadcasting entity, you have to ask yourself what's going on here,\" he told MPs.</p> <p>\"They are the co-publishers of Hello magazine, which they license in India.

  "<p>Five letters to strike fear into the heart of even the most well-remunerated of basketballers: DNP-CD.</p> <p>It's the ultimate measure of disgrace and disenchantment when your contribution to the box score statistic is illustrated, not by points, rebounds or assistants, but instead with confirmation that (you) Did Not Play - Coach's Decision. That you sat, unused and unwanted at the end of the bench, in that netherworld known as the doghouse. The best you can hope for is the occasional TV appearance in a time-out, listening to instructions which you will never have to carry out.</p> <p>Welcome to the world of Stephon Marbury, now officially the NBA's highest-paid cheerleader. Twelve years in the league. Twice an All-Star. <a href=\"http://www.nba.com/playerfile/stephon_marbury/\" title=\"\">Career averages of a shade under 20 points and eight assists</a>. And now an outcast in his hometown of New York, the fall guy as the Knicks clean house and attempt to rid themselves of all traces of their sordid and ignominious recent past.</p> <p>To use a Big Apple-ism, they've sucked. For several years, the league's highest payroll has bought nothing but embarrassment. Ever since their Patrick Ewing-inspired <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_NBA_Finals\" title=\"\">run to the Finals over a decade ago</a>, it's been downhill all the way at Madison Square Garden. Bankrolled limitlessly by James Dolan, a wealthy cable magnate, coaches have come and gone, so-called stars have arrived and immediately lost their veneer, and boos have out-weighed the cheers at the ultimate mecca of American sport.</p> <p>But this season is where Mike D'Antoni draws the line. There's a new sheriff in town, charged with weeding out the trouble-makers, and the Knicks' new coach has made his intentions clear by leaving Marbury out in the cold. The point guard has repeatedly signalled his disinclination to accept a buy-out of his gargantuan $21m-a-year deal, a financial millstone bequeathed by Isiah Thomas, one of many <a href=\"http://ballhype.com/story/isiah_thomas_bans_stephon_marbury_from_msg/\" title=\"\">past coaches and team-mates with whom he has feuded</a>. Dysfunction was the hallmark of Thomas's calamitous reign, but under D'Antoni and new general manager Donnie Walsh the ghosts will be ruthlessly buried, Marbury included.</p> <p>D'Antoni's reputation was forged during his long stint in charge of the Phoenix Suns, where his run 'n' gun philosophy won hearts, if not championships. It's just what New York needs. With their current roster, and the immediate limitation of the salary cap, the play-offs are an unlikely destination this season, and probably next. All they can offer their unforgiving public in the interim is entertainment and, averaging 98 points from their opening three games, the offense-first philosophy is clear.</p> <p>It is, curiously, one made for a playground-schooled shooter like Marbury. Except in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/feedarticle/7977929\" title=\"\">consecutive losses to Philadelphia and Milwaukee</a>, his attire was suit rather than jersey and shorts, sat closer to Spike Lee than the parquet. Having DNP-CDed in the opening-night win over Miami when some fans chanted \"We Want Steph\", the inactive list beckons and there is no telling when, or if, the Legend of Coney Island will come off it again.</p> <p>Officially, at least, D'Antoni will leave the door ajar. \"He does make a lot of money and you never know what happens,\" he said. \"Obviously we went into a different direction but at the same time we owe him money and if an injury happens I wouldn't hesitate putting him back in.\"</p> <p>In truth, the most naturally gifted player at his disposal will play no role in the revolution. His contract, the second highest in the NBA, means it will be impossible to trade Marbury away, even though, at 31, he still has miles left in his tank. Likewise, if he is waived, the Knicks will have to cough up his full salary. \"I signed the contract,\" he pointed out, \"and in the contract it says this is how much money I'm going to make this year.\" Hence his options are limited to seeing spirits sag in the DNP Club, or take a boatload of cash and let both parties move amicably on.</p> <p>General manager Donnie Walsh plans to step in to try and break the deadlock to end this sorry sideshow. He can ask his outcast again how much it would take him to make leave quietly via the side door. Or hand him a pair of pom-poms to wave, and keep him well out of potential harm's way. The Knicks might still suck but the coach's decision looks final. Allowing Marbury to infect the rejuvenation treatment is just a risk too far.</p> <p><strong>Offensive rebounds</strong></p> <p>\u2022 The team-work experiment is over. Monday's unexpected trade which sees <a href=\"http://www.nba.com/video/channels/nba_tv/2008/11/03/nba_det_20081103_curry_intv.nba/\" title=\"\">Allen Iverson arrive in Detroit and Chauncey Billups and Antonio McDyess head to Denver</a> signals the effective end of the Pistons' 2004 Championship squad, a group which broke the recent mould by lifting a title without a single major star. After losing in the last three Eastern Conference Finals, Detroit GM Joe Dumars said all summer that change was needed. By acquiring an ageing Iverson in the last year of his contract, re-building is now the aim. But you have to wonder when, or if, we'll see the likes of that admirable Pistons squad again.</p> <p>\u2022 With Great Britain set to learn the identity of their opponents for next summer's Eurobasket finals in Saturday's draw, it is a good sign when Londoner Pops Mensah-Bonsu gets <a href=\"http://www.basketball247.co.uk/news/archives/00000225.shtml\" title=\"\">named as the Euroleague's Most Valuable Player of the week</a> for his club, Joventut Badalona. Yet NBA commissioner David Stern doesn't think Euro teams are a real threat to his league because top players won't want to play in front of a few thousand spectators. \"It's not something that we spent a lot of time on,\" he said last week. However, failing to attract the likes of Mensah-Bonsu - who rebuffed the Minnesota Timberwolves in the summer - will seriously weaken NBA benches, chipping away at the overall health of Stern's product. Ignore Europe's rich owners at your peril.</p>",

  "<p>The BBC is returning to a semblance of normality after last week's Sachsgate rumpus but the internal rumblings apparently continue, with a number of scores waiting to be settled. For starters, <strong>BBC News</strong> executives are hopping mad at the BBC's corporate press office. Monkey hears that as the story broke, the BBC press office was spinning its own news outlets, telling them at first that it was not a story, then that they were overplaying it - and ought to be more helpful. \"But if we had gone soft, the Daily Mail would have crucified us. And anyway, our viewers and listeners were telling us it was a story,\" said one senior BBC News insider. \"The problem was that no one with a journalism background was around at a senior level, and Helen Boaden, the director of BBC News, could offer advice - but it was not taken [by management].\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, Monkey was just one of many observers baffled by how slow the BBC was at getting its act together to tackle Sachsgate issue and put an end to it. The BBC's response was said to have been hampered because a number of senior executives were off on half-term holiday, however, Monkey understands that BBC director of audio and music, <strong>Tim Davie</strong>, and deputy director general <strong>Mark Byford</strong> were at least keeping close tabs on Russell Brand. Last Sunday night, after the Mail on Sunday had splashed on Brand and Jonathan Ross's offending Radio 2 broadcast, Davie and Byford were apparently enjoying BBC corporate hospitality at the Electric Proms Oasis gig in London's Roundhouse. Along with BBC talent including Chris Moyles - and Russell Brand. Couldn't you just have had a quiet word in his ear or something, lads? </p>",
  "<p>The BBC's plans for local online video news services came under renewed attack today, as the chief executives of Guardian Media Group and Trinity Mirror told a House of Commons select committee that the proposals could put regional newspapers out of business.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/carolynmccall\">Carolyn McCall</a>, the chief executive of GMG, which publishes MediaGuardian.co.uk, and the Trinity Mirror chief executive, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/slybailey\">Sly Bailey</a>, also both questioned the role of the BBC Trust in deciding whether the corporation's local online news plans should be allowed to proceed.</p> <p>McCall said her group's flagship regional newspaper title, the Manchester Evening News, was fighting for survival in the advertising downturn.</p> <p>She added that if regional newspapers are put out of business \"you end up with a very strong BBC and nothing else\" when it comes to providing local news.</p> <p>Bailey painted an equally grim picture of the regional newspaper business, saying her company had closed 44 local and titles this year because of the advertising downturn and the industry's structural move to multimedia publishing.</p> <p>McCall told MPs on the Commons culture, media and sport select committee: \"The Manchester Evening News is fighting to survive - that's not a dramatic phrase. Margins in the regional press are being squeezed very hard and the issue for me is significant, not just for me because I'm a publisher but because I think this is a danger to plurality, diversity and democracy.</p> <p>\"I think if you start losing local newspaper local websites you end up with a very strong BBC and nothing else.\"</p> <p>McCall also questioned the BBC Trust's role in deciding the fate of the corporation's local online video news plans. The BBC Trust is conducting a public value test over proposals by the corporation to spend up to \u00a323m a year to create video-based news websites in 60 regions of the UK.</p> <p>\"The trust has made it clear to management that it's a strategic imperative to enter local,\" she said.</p> <p>\"When we then engage with the trust and say we have a real problem with local video, who are we talking to - the regulator or someone championing the BBC? A regulator should be unambiguously a regulator,\" McCall added.</p> <p>Bailey told the committee that any BBC local online video service, regardless of limits placed on it, would draw an audience away from local services offered by commercial rivals.</p> <p>\"The BBC has lost sight of its strategy, it has lost sight of its purpose, it's using public money to compete in public areas where it simply doesn't need to be. All organisations need parameters and targets,\" Bailey told the committee.</p> <p>\"The problem with the BBC right now is that in its quest to serve all audiences it is clearly without parameters, as a result of that I would say to you that the management are out of control and the trust are not in control.\"</p> <p>McCall said the development of rival services by the BBC could have a detrimental impact on the fledgling digital services of regional and local newspapers across the country as it did not have to justify developments commercially.</p> <p>\"You can't have a local website without video; it has taken local publishers a long time to get the investment to do video and to actually do video on a return-on-investment basis,\" McCall added.</p> <p>\"We are having to go to quite a lot of pain to justify the capital expenditure required to put video on websites, because at the moment websites don't have return on investment commercially, so you have to take risks. </p> <p>\"The BBC would be able to do local video much more quickly with much more deeper pockets and they would be able to leapfrog the regional press in terms of what they can do and that is going to be unbelievably damaging for local media that might not be able to survive that kind of onslaught.\"</p> <p><em><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857.

  "<p>Eli Sanders at The Stranger <a href=\"http://slog.thestranger.com/2008/11/will_marilyn_dunhams_vote_count\">wondered</a>: Will Madelyn Dunham's vote count? She'd voted absentee some time ago.

Some weird stuff happened in France this weekend but a lot of things were comfortingly familiar: Karim Benzema scored another cracker to rescue Lyon, Bordeaux's inconsistency once again proved their undoing, while Saint-Etienne and Paris Saint-Germain both lost to leave their owners talking balls.</p> <p>France's new golden boy of tennis <a href=\"http://www.theage.com.au/ffximage/2008/01/23/wbTENNIStsonga3_narrowweb__300x394,0.jpg\" title=\"\">Jo-Wilfried Tsonga</a> comes from Le Mans, but his local team failed to live up to Ligue 1's best away record - unbeaten in five with 13 goals scored - as they barely troubled Lyon in a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIsCVvW89U8\">2-0 loss</a> at the Stade Gerland. Coach Yves Bertucci's decision to drop winger Gervinho and top scorer Thorstein Helstad to the bench didn't help, but it's not easy to stop Benzema on current form. He followed up a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhJXjx4fL9A\">screamer </a>in last week's win over Sochaux with an <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1nPg2wIFks\">even better effort</a> for his eighth goal of the season.</p> <p>Benzema is reacting well to the first moments of pressure in his career. He has been criticised since Euro 2008 for not repeating his Lyon performances for Les Bleus, not getting on with Thierry Henry on the pitch, and even passing too much to Franck Rib\u00e9ry. Zinedine Zidane sparked a minor spat when he suggested that Benzema did not look at ease in the France set-up. Benzema responded by telling TV show Le Grand Journal: \"I wouldn't pay to play alongside Zidane, why would I do that? I've learnt that when you're at the top of the pile, there are people who will try and bring you down, so I have to be more careful with what I say.\" Zidane, in an <a href=\"http://www.lesdessousdusport.fr/daniel-bravo-consultant-pour-le-10-sport-1777\" title=\"\">interview with ex-PSG star Daniel Bravo</a> in Le 10 Sport, backtracked: \"Anything I say is for his benefit and he mustn't think I am criticising. I want Karim to be aware that he can be an extraordinary player, and I admire his qualities.\"</p> <p>He is not alone. Luis Fern\u00e1ndez has nicknamed him \"Benzemax\" and put him a level above the rest of the league. \"It's so easy for him to lose his markers and he always shoots on target. With his control, ease on the ball and technique, I would compare him to Enzo Francescoli.\" The irony of his comparison is not lost on those who know that the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbzpj7m7zzw\">Uruguayan forward</a> was Zidane's hero, and the player after whom he <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIbDypWKmNw\">named his son</a>.</p> <p>Benzemax (let's try and run with it, for Luis's sake) is certainly responding well to Claude Puel's management - which L'Equipe described as <a href=\"http://www.lequipe.fr/Football/L1_20082009_12J_Lyon_1.html\" title=\"\">\"juggling\"</a> due to his switches between 4-4-2 and 4-3-3 formations, trust in youngsters and experiments with Kim Kallstrom and John Mensah at left-back. Until Mathieu Bodmer returns from injury, Lyon will still look dodgy at the back, as Cris is some way off his best form and Jean-Alain Boumsong has been rubbish all season. But Benzemax, with 45% of Lyon's goals this season, can be relied upon to bail them out at the other end.</p> <p>Laurent Blanc's rotation system at Bordeaux is not quite as successful: he made six changes before the 4-0 midweek win over Le Havre briefly put them level with Lyon and top of the table, but another four changes did not help them in a 1-0 defeat at struggling Nancy, for whom Youssouf Hadji came up with this <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4vgylmsQkk\">excellent winner</a>. \"They had one shot and scored, and if that's the way they want to play football what can you do?\" said Blanc after the game. \"It's not the way I see football.\" Five days after topping the pile, Bordeaux are now six points behind Lyon.</p> <p>Marseille are two points ahead of Bordeaux after last week's enfant terrible, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2008/oct/28/ligue-1-paris-st-germain-marseille\" title=\"\">Hatem Ben Arfa</a>, made amends by setting up two goals and scoring one in a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8pELIl4iEQ\">3-1 win over Saint-Etienne</a>. After Marseille coach Eric Gerets had said, \"I've got the players I want and if we don't do well this season it will be down to me,\" he has now decided L'OM need a penalty-box \"killer\" and named Fred and Steve Savidan <a href=\"http://www.francefootball.fr/FF/breves2008/20081030_142627_gerets-parle-de-savidan-et-fred_Dev.html\" title=\"\">as his targets</a>. L'Equipe has added Lens' <a href=\"http://www.becks-and-vic.fr/\" title=\"\">fashion-boutique</a> owner Toifilou Maoulida to that list while Le 10 Sport included Sochaux youngster and Arsenal target Mevlut Erding. No one has mentioned Saint-Etienne's hero of last season, Baf\u00e9timbi Gomis, despite him scoring his <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_TJeexlwKA\">third goal in five games </a>at the V\u00e9lodrome. Gomis has stuggled since Pascal Feindouno left for Qatar and was unhappy when vice-president Roland Romeyer claimed \"the players are not pulling their weight and Gomis has had a big head ever since his France call-up. Former Saint\u00e9 hero Jean-Michel Larqu\u00e9 told Romeyer to shut up. \"Telling everyone they should have sold Gomis just weakens the manager, and nobody wins,\" he said. \"He's shooting himself in the foot.\"</p> <p>Charles Villeneuve is another owner whose words may come back to haunt him. The PSG boss has seen his side follow up last week's 4-2 win over Marseille with dismal 1-0 defeats to first Toulouse and now <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqv1lede9ow\">Nice</a>. \"Paul Le Guen and I are in perfect harmony, and not even a hair's shadow separates us,\" he told <a href=\"http://www.leparisien.fr/sports/villeneuve-l-objectif-est-de-finir-la-saison-avec-le-guen-03-11-2008-297666.php\" title=\"\">Le Parisien</a>. Le Guen told his players to show more aggression and commitment at half-time, but got little response. \"He asked them to show certain parts of their genitals to get them to wake up,\" added Villeneuve. \"I liked what he said and I have the feeling that the players don't love winning as much as we both do. Our goal is to finish the season with Le Guen.\" As votes of confidence go, it's more touchy-feely than most. Don't say you weren't warned, Paul.</p> <p>He'd have had more fun at one of his former clubs Rennes this weekend. <a href=\"http://www.salma-hayek.net/\" title=\"\">Salma Hayek</a> was in France's Wild Wild West to give the players a pre-match dressing-room pep-talk - her ex-fianc\u00e9 Fran\u00e7ois-Henri Pinault is the son of the owner - and was presented with a Hayek No 10 shirt, which she wore to greet the fans before kick-off. There was nothing Desperado about the players' response: Jimmy Briand, the player Le Guen wanted (but was not able) to sign, scored a first-minute penalty and After the Sunset Rennes were up to sixth place. Hayek's appearance came soon after <a href=\"http://kakashikoshi.blogspot.com/2008/06/eva-langoria-aime-nancy.html\" title=\"\">Eva Longoria</a> was spotted at a Nancy basketball match.

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/tradeunions\">Trade unions</a> will tonight seek to overturn some of Lady Thatcher's restrictive industrial laws that Labour has refused to repeal since Tony Blair won the 1997 general election.</p> <p>Thirty-six rebel Labour MPs are backing a campaign coordinated by the TUC to <a href=\"http://www.tuc.org.uk/law/tuc-15515-f0.cfm\">amend the employment bill</a>, which is going through Parliament and comes up for debate tonight.</p> <p>The legislation will simplify balloting laws, close a legal loophole that allows employers to use agencies to break strikes, give greater protection to individuals following the taking of industrial action and allow unions to expel fascists from unions.</p> <p>As well as many members of the left-wing <a href=\"http://www.scgn.org.uk/\">Campaign Group</a>, the rebels include Jon Cruddas, the former Labour deputy leadership candidate whom Gordon Brown toyed with giving a ministerial job, ex-minister Kate Hoey, Andrew Dismore, who chairs the joint human rights committee, Michael Connarty, MP for Linlithgow and East Falkirk, Gordon Prentice, MP for Pendle, Dennis Skinner, MP for Bolsover and Eric Illsley, MP for Barnsley Central.</p> <p>The move has the backing of more than a dozen unions and follows a three-year campaign for a trade union freedom bill, which was talked out by ministers earlier this year.</p> <p>Unite, Unison, GMB, the Communications Workers union, Public and Commercial Services union, the RMT, Fire Brigades union, Prison Officers' Association, the Bakers' union, Aslef, National Association of Prison Officers and the National Union of Mineworkers are all supporting the TUC campaign.</p> <p>The most successful amendment - which the government is likely to back - proposes changing the law to expel British National party (BNP) members from unions. Ministers are under pressure from the European Commission to amend the law.</p> <p>Labour MPs and the anti-fascist campaign group Searchlight want to change amendments to the bill made during its Lords' stages, saying they must be overturned because they prevent unions from expelling people for membership of a political party.</p> <p>The issue was highlighted when the train drivers' union, Aslef, fought for, but lost, the right to expel a BNP activist. The union had to pay the member compensation and costs.</p> <p>Jon Cruddas, the MP for Dagenham, said: \"It is incomprehensible that, while the threat to our communities posed by the BNP grows, the very law which should support unions as they seek to protect themselves from the far right could be seriously weakened. This is not the time or place to give in to those who do not understand the central role unions play in bringing our communities and workplaces together. We must not open up our unions to the politics of division.\"</p> <p>John McDonnell, the MP for Hayes and Harlington, said: \"It is wrong that workers should have to pay for corporate greed with their jobs, homes and livelihoods. Having stood by the bankers, the government now needs to stand by the workers.</p> <p>\"Ever since we came to power, Labour party members and supporters have demanded that the government at least make some move to repeal the worst of Thatcher's anti-union laws. Now, at long last, MPs will be allowed to vote on what is commonly regarded as some of the most backward legislation on employee rights in Europe.\"</p> <p>The Tories are likely to join with Labour to defeat many of the amendments - the main embarrassment the government could suffer from the size of the rebellion is that Tories will be able to claim they have saved ministers from trade union demands they did not want to accept.</p>",

  "<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/premierfoods\">Premier Foods</a></strong> - the Hovis and Branston Pickle group - has had a rocky time with its share price recently. Last month it fell sharply on concerns about its debt, before reassuring investors it expected to meet its banking covenants.</p> <p>Today the shares have jumped 44% to 41p, on reasonable volumes of 6m shares traded so far. Part of this appeared to be short-sellers covering their positions, but analysts also suggested there was a read across from results announcements today from Marks &amp; Spencer and Associated British Foods.</p> <p>M&amp;S - although food sales fell 5.3% on a like-for-like basis - said it saw opportunities to grow market share over the long term. Around 10% of Premier's business is supplying own label products to M&amp;S.</p> <p>And ABF's grocery division - a similar operation to Premier - produced annual profits of \u00a39m, ahead of expectations according to Investec's Martin Deboo.</p> <p>Overall, with US futures seemingly showing the Obama effect and indicating a 267-point opening on Wall Street, the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> is near its best level of the day, up 117.05 points at 4560.33.</p> <p>News that <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/reedelsevier\">Reed Elsevier</a></strong>, up 15.5p at 564.5p, has <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/nov/04/pressandpublishing-mediabusiness\">appointed Ian Smith, formerly of Taylor Wimpey, as its new chief executive </a>has prompted renewed speculation the publisher might bid for European rival Wolters Kluwer.</p> <p>Gareth Thomas at Collins Stewart said: \"Smith was chief executive of housebuilder Taylor Woodrow for seven months last year, arranged the merger with George Wimpey, then left just before the credit crunch (excellent timing).

  "<p>China and Taiwan moved closer to overcoming six decades of hostilities today, as they signed deals drastically expanding direct flights and allowing shipping links across the Formosa strait.</p> <p>The agreement follows a dramatic thaw in relations over the last six months, since the election of Taiwan's new president, Ma Ying-jeou. The island broke away from the mainland at the end of the civil war in 1949.</p> <p>Beijing and Taipei have agreed to set aside contentious political issues to work on improving economic links - important to both at a time of worldwide gloom.</p> <p>Thousands of demonstrators led by the opposition Democratic People's party spent a night on the streets of central Taipei, using loudspeakers to condemn the visit of Chen Yunlin - the most senior Chinese official to visit the island in 60 years - and accuse Ma of selling out to Beijing.</p> <p>But today Chen enjoyed a warmer welcome as he sipped champagne with his Taiwanese counterpart, Chiang Pin-kung. The two men posed for photographers holding a piece of framed calligraphy reading: \"Peaceful negotiation creates a win-win situation.\"</p> <p>Chiang told reporters that direct shipping would shave 16 hours and up to 30% in costs off voyages, helping Taiwan to become an Asian transport hub and explore the mainland market.</p> <p>This summer saw the first regular direct flights across the 100-mile strait since the civil war, but Andrew Yang, the secretary general of the Chinese Council for Advanced Policy Studies think tank in Taipei, said today's deal, which also tripled the number of flights, was a major advance on that symbolic change.</p> <p>\"Now it's more substantial,\" he said. \"Direct cargo links also means Taiwan's hi-tech products can be directly shipped to the mainland, which should boost the confidence of local people ... Hopefully more robust cross-Straits economic ties will help to stabilize the economic situation.\"</p> <p>Yang said it was too early to judge how Ma's slumping poll ratings would be affected by the agreement.</p> <p>The agreement also includes measures for greater cooperation on food safety, enabling faster recalls of substandard products and better exchange of information.</p> <p>The two sides agreed to hold talks every six months and focus on closer financial ties in the next round of discussions. Taiwan's negotiator suggested joint criminal law enforcement could also be on the agenda.</p> <p>Taiwan has enjoyed effective independence since the end of the civil war in 1949, but Beijing has warned it would take military action if the island attempts to formalise its status.</p>",
  "<p>Bangladesh and Burma, two of the world's poorest nations, have sent warships into the Bay of Bengal amid escalating tensions over a vast disputed gas find.</p> <p>Bangladesh said today it had sent a British-made frigate, the BNS Kopothakka, to join three other warships some 30 miles south of Saint Martin Island, a palm fringed smudge of sand. The Burmese authorities estimate that 14 trillion cubic feet of gas lies beneath the sea floor.</p> <p>The military-backed government in Dhaka, which is preparing to transfer power through elections, has said it will take \"all possible measures\" to protect its nation's assets. The country is also sending its top foreign civil servant to meet with the military junta in Burma.</p> <p>The row was sparked by the appearance of a Burmese exploration ship escorted by a flotilla of naval boats that skirted the edge of the island last week.</p> <p>Bangladesh insists the disputed waters fall within its territory and has demanded the Burmese ships withdraw until a maritime boundary can be established through talks.</p> <p>This is the same argument used by the junta in Rangoon to defend its ships. The senior official from Burma's foreign ministry told Reuters: \"We have no reason to stop the exploration activities since these blocks are located in our exclusive economic zone. We will go ahead with it.\"</p> <p>Analysts say the two impoverished nations both want to control as much of the energy rich Bay of Bengal as possible. However, Burma's regime has come to view hydrocarbon wealth as essential for its survival \u2013 making a looming clash with Bangladesh a potentially dangerous flashpoint.</p> <p>In the last year, Burma earned $2.6bn from selling gas. Not only can the military generals buy off bigger neighbours such as China and India, the exports insulate the country from western sanctions.</p> <p>A report by the Asian Development Bank earlier this year, warned sales of natural gas were creating growing trade surpluses and a valuable buffer for Burma's ruling generals.</p>",
  "<p>The driver of the underground train on which Jean Charles de Menezes was killed believed the police who shot dead the young Brazilian were terrorists, an inquest heard today.</p> <p>Quincy Akpesiri Oji ran across live tracks into a tunnel to escape from the police, who he believed were \"fanatics\" shooting at passengers.</p> <p>\"I got to the Stockwell tube station just before 10am,\" Akpesiri Oji said in a statement read to the inquest into de Menezes's death. \"When I got there the light was red. This was unusual.</p> <p>\"I then heard people screaming and I looked at the monitor at the front of the train. I heard gunshots. There were about 15 of them. I think there were about 15 shots.</p> <p>\"I saw one of the men with a large gun shooting and I thought they were fanatics and they were shooting at people on the carriage. I have run into the dark tunnel.\"</p> <p>The driver spoke of his fear, saying that the tracks were live and trains were approaching nearby.</p> <p>He added: \"I stood there with my back against the wall for about 20 seconds. Someone flashed a light into the tunnel. I said, 'Please do not shoot - I am the driver.'\"</p> <p>De Menezes was shot seven times in the head shortly after he got onto the train at Stockwell station in south London early on July 22, 2005. </p> <p>Police killed the 27-year-old, mistakenly believing he was Hussein Osman, one of a group of would-be suicide bombers who had attempted to set off bombs on a number of tube trains and a bus the previous day.</p> <p>Police involved in the operation have told the inquest \u2013 being held at Oval cricket ground, near Stockwell - that they had shouted warnings to de Menezes, identifying themselves. One officer said the Brazilian then stood up and walked towards them, prompting fears he was about to detonate a bomb.</p> <p>However, a series of passengers travelling on the carriage where de Menezes was shot have contradicted this account, saying they heard no warnings and that de Menezes gave no significant reaction to the policemen's arrival.</p> <p>One passenger, Anna Dunwoodie, said yesterday that the young electrician appeared calm as a gun was held to his head. She was \"very, very clear\" officers did not shout any warnings before shooting him dead.</p> <p>Later, the inquest heard from a scientific expert who said de Menezes had taken cocaine less than 12 hours before his death but added that it was impossible to know whether this might have affected his behaviour.</p> <p>Explaining the possible effect of trace amounts of cocaine in de Menezes's system, Graham Mould, a drugs expert at Royal Surrey County Hospital, said the Brazilian could have been in a state of \"dysphoria\", meaning depressed or anxious.<br> \"There may have been an element of agitation as well,\" he said. \"Whether this would lead to unusual behaviour which caused the police to act as they did, I would suggest, is difficult to say.\"</p> <p>Another expert, Dr Franco Tomei, explained that tests showed de Menezes was killed as he was pinned down to his seat.</p> <p>\"When the shots were first sustained, Jean Charles was probably pushed over on his left side. His head would have been horizontal,\" he said, adding that a single bullet would have been enough to incapacitate him in that position.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> London. <br> <strong>The lineup:</strong> Andy B and Neil C. <br> <strong>The background:</strong> Deadfisch are an odd fisch. There's nothing strange about the self-styled music/art project's timing: they've chosen today as the historic date for the release of their double A-side single Hey Mister President/God Bless America, but we're not sure what it is they're trying to tell us about the election or the nation on the brink of major, seismic change. <br> They're not American, so they sing about the place with wry dispassion and humorous concern. No, they're quintessential Brit eccentrics - God Bless America features, on banjo and fiddle, one Wild Willy Barrett, who briefly achieved notoriety, as the bearded caveman half of Otway and Barrett, with that weird one-off punk-era hit, Really Free. The track also features the Sheffield Socialist Choir on backing vocals, although they sound like they're from South Carolina not South Yorkshire, possibly due to the fact that the song includes soundbites from that bloke Oliver Stone has just made a biopic about (George W something) while the music resembles the Duelling Banjos theme from the movie Deliverance meets Cotton Eye Joe by Rednex, that terminally infectious novelty country'n'disco hoedown from the mid-90s.  They're big on cameos and guest stints (\"world-famous\" opera singer Ursula Ferri appears - either in a real sense or in sampled form, we can't tell - on a track of theirs called Das Lied Von Der Erde), but Deadfisch are a duo. The brains of the operation is Andy B, formerly an Art Director at Saatchi's who has exhibited at the National Portrait Gallery - fans of his work include Billy Bragg, who played a Deadfisch-designed guitar on the Southbank last year. Then there's Neil C, who used to be in Marillion, on keyboards.  The bit about them being a \"music/art project\" is a relief \u2013 it lends meaning and playful purpose to what otherwise would be rock ordinaire with the occasional sampled voice or electronic effect. So they're auctioning off a Deadfisch-designed surfboard for the charity Military Families Against War, and they're about to issue an anti-war concept album titled Collateral Damage which apparently \"encompasses an eclectic range of styles from club to rock to opera and follows the story of one young soldier\".  Which is all well and good. We just wish they'd used the opportunity to make their songs as intriguing as their extracurricular ventures and as powerful as the themes they explore in their music, which is mostly an unfocused, bombastic mess. Hey Mister President is the sort of blue-collar anthem a US President might use as a campaign rally rabble-rouser and hold up as an example of middle-American vigour, a Springsteen or Mellencamp of a pedal-to-the-metal freeway stomper. God Bless America is like a C&amp;W version of Two Tribes, with air-raid sirens, gunfire, pounding beats and a gently pummelling bassline, with Dubya quotes over the artillery, a screechy guitar solo and crowd roars, plus a burst of reggae in the middle before it goes all dosey-do again. Maybe the muddled mix is a deliberate attempt to mirror the mess of the Bush administration.  They've got one other track, Extraordinary Rendition, which sounds like a pub full of revellers wailing drunkenly along with a ramshackle version of the Star Spangled Banner (plus some Monty Python daft-old-lady voices at the end). What Deadfisch are commenting on or protesting about remains unclear, and as with the Oliver Stone movie it's a bit like closing the stable door after the horse has bolted, but there is something vaguely righteous about the project, even if it does lack radical intent/content.  <strong>The buzz:</strong> \"The politics are handled with humour; no po-faces were present.\"<br> <strong>The truth:</strong> Why so (mildly) caustic and (seemingly) critical? Obama is coming! <br> <strong>Most likely to:</strong> Put a dampener on proceedings. <br> <strong>Least likely to:</strong> Be played on Bush's iPod as he packs and leaves the White House. <br> <strong>What to buy:</strong> Hey Mister President/God Bless America is available today from iTunes, with the album Collateral Damage to follow.<br> <strong>File next to:</strong> Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band, Mothers of Invention, Rednex, Medicine Head. <br> <strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/deadfisch\">www.myspace.com/deadfisch</a> </p> <p><strong>Tomorrow's new band:</strong> Jay Jay Pistolet</p>",
  "<p>Tehran taxi drivers might not know where the US embassy used to be, especially if they weren't around when the Islamic Revolution took place in 1979. But ask for the \"nest of spies\" and they will head as fast as the permanently gridlocked traffic allows to Taleghani Avenue, where slogans and murals on a long brick wall proclaim a historic victory over \"global arrogance\".</p> <p>Americans remember the compound as the scene where their diplomats were held hostage for 444 days until finally being freed in January 1981 as a gesture to Ronald Reagan, the incoming Republican president. </p> <p>Reagan's predecessor, Jimmy Carter - the Democrat who had urged Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi to make concessions to the opposition - ended his term with another stinging humiliation from the man who removed Pahlavi from the Peacock Throne, Ayatollah Khomeini.</p> <p>It was a coincidence that this year's anniversary of the storming of the embassy yesterday fell so close to the American presidential election, providing a vivid and timely reminder of the tortured relationship between the US and Iran .</p> <p>The speeches to mark the anniversary from the podium outside what was once called Roosevelt gate were predictably fiery. Familiar slogans - \"Death to America\" \"Death to Israel\" and \"Death to Zionism\" - were chanted in Farsi, Arabic and finally English to ensure maximum impact. Young Basij volunteers in camouflage gear and green Imam Hussein headbands sang sweetly of sacrifice and martyrdom. War veterans in wheelchairs were given place of honour on carpets rolled out in the street.</p> <p>Iranians say that the turnout at such set-piece official events is in decline and only kept up by bussing in soldiers, militiamen and children who are given the day off school to carry placards, wave banners, and burn the odd flag. The embassy rally has the ritualistic, symbolic quality of something that is done because it has been done for years, not because it means that much any more.</p> <p>Massoud, a 15-year-old Tehran schoolboy, posed happily with a \"Death to the USA\" poster, oblivious to the irony of his Colorado Rockies sweatshirt, jeans and trainers. \"I hate the US government, not the people,\" he explained. \"And especially not those who love justice and don't want to dominate the world.\"</p> <p>Only the teenage girls, some in black chadors though many with headscarves draped loosely over carefully-arranged hair, looked any different from their American counterparts.</p> <p>\"If the US embassy re-opened and started issuing visas to Iranians again, a lot of these people would be queuing up to get one,\" quipped Hussein, a teacher and trenchant critic of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. </p> <p>\"Many of my friends are thinking of leaving the country if they can because they are so unhappy with the way the government is running things.\"</p> <p>Officially, there is little interest here in the outcome of the US election. Ayatollah Khamenei, the supreme leader, has spoken of \"deep-seated differences\" between the two countries, apparently seeking to squash speculation about any sudden change, or at least ensuring that he will control it if there is. </p> <p>\"Obama and McCain have differences over tactics, not strategy,\" argued Hamidreza Taraghi of the Islamic Coalition party, an Ahmadinejad ally. \"Anyway they are both sponsored by the Zionists so we can't expect they won't be influenced by them.\"</p> <p>Jamal, a middle-aged driver, wanted to see John McCain in the White House because \"he will attack Iran and set us free\". Yet he also wants Iran to develop nuclear weapons (the government insists, to widespread scepticism abroad, that its only motive in developing nuclear technology is to generate power). \"We are threatened by the US and Israel. If the Jews have the atomic bomb, why shouldn't we?\"</p> <p>Voices in the reformist camp are more nuanced about the prospects of an Obama win. Hossein Adeli, head of the Ravand Foundation, the country's only non-official NGO, predicts that positive gestures from Washington will be met by greater Iranian cooperation over Iraq and Afghanistan. \"If Obama wants to change the image of America in the world Iran is one area were he can demonstrate it,\" he said. \"It would give him the edge over his predecessors.\"</p> <p>With so much at stake it is natural that the world is focused on the drama of the race for the White House. But, the Iranian reformists suggest, it may be that their own presidential election next June will prove almost as crucial. </p> <p>Ahmadinejad's rhetoric about Israel and the Holocaust - the latter at least an embarrassment to many here - will likely be a serious barrier to any rapprochement. But if Obama makes it to the Oval Office he could expect to find an easier interlocutor in Mohamed Khatemi, the former president who oversaw a partial thaw in US-Iranian relations until George Bush's \"axis of evil\" speech and the subsequent focus on Iran's nuclear ambitions. Reformists hope Khatemi will stand again, pointing to reliable polling that shows his popularity ratings more than double those of Ahmadinejad.</p> <p>But it is highly uncertain whether he will stand, and unlikely that he or any other reformist could actually win.</p> <p>\"For Iranians, the election in the US is not important,\" said Mohammed Ali Abtahi, a cleric and former vice-president under Khatemi. \"What is important is what happens here.\"</p> <p>Farnaz, a 22-year-old animator, was born years after the drama of Tehran's \"nest of spies\" and barely glances at the angry slogans on Taleghani Avenue. Farnaz prefers Obama to McCain or Bush. But for her, too, Iran's biggest problems lie closer to home - and their solution in the hands of her compatriots. \"If Ahmadinejad goes and is replaced by someone else,\" she smiled, \"then I'm sure things can get better here.\"</p>",
  "<p>Martin Johnson has named four debutants - Delon Armitage, Ugo Monye, Riki Flutey and Nick Kennedy - in the England team to start against the Pacific Islanders on Saturday.

He will start in the second row alongside captain Steve Borthwick after being preferred to the Wasps pair Tom Palmer and Simon Shaw. Armitage will start at full-back with Monye, who has been inspirational for Harlequins this season, on the left wing and Flutey at inside centre.</p> <p>Flutey, the former Junior All Black and New Zealand Maori, qualified to play for England on residency grounds in September and has been promoted straight into the team. Jamie Noon will start on Flutey's right shoulder at outside centre, while Danny Cipriani and Danny Care link up in the half-backs.</p> <p>The new arrivals leave England light on experience in the back division, with only Jamie Noon and Paul Sackey boasting a caps total in double figures. On top of the three debutants, Danny Care only made his Test debut in the summer while Cipriani has started just one game for England.</p> <p>\"There are lots of new caps and new faces around but there is also some experience,\" Johnson said. \"We are happy with the guys we have picked. Monye and Armitage have been very impressive all season and in camp over the last 10 days. There are some new caps in there and it is exciting.\"</p> <p>Up front, Harlequins' Nick Easter has returned to the side at No8 with dynamic Leicester flanker Tom Croft preferred to James Haskell on the blindside. In the front row, Bath tight-head prop Matt Stevens has kept out former captain Phil Vickery while Lee Mears retained the hooker's jersey despite competition from Hartley.</p> <p>\"These guys are bursting to get out on the field,\" Johnson said. \"It is an exciting back line.

  "<p>The Legal Services Commission (LSC) is the government body responsible for providing legal representation to people who cannot afford to pay for it themselves. It currently employs around 1,700 staff in its London headquarters, 12 regional offices in England and one office in Wales, and provides legal aid to more than two million people each year. </p> <p>Part of the Ministry of Justice, the LSC provides two services; one for people bringing civil cases, such as family law, housing and immigration matters, and another for defendants in criminal cases. </p> <p>The LSC has been under intense financial pressure in recent months. Following a review of the legal aid system by Lord Carter in 2006, it began moving towards a \"market-based system\" that involved stringent budget cuts. The LSC has been stating repeatedly since 2006 that its spending levels were unsustainable and that \"fundamental reform\" would be necessary if the organisation were to cope with its role of delivering legal aid in future. </p> <p>One of the most controversial areas of reform has been a system of fixed and graduated fees for lawyers doing legal aid work. There were fears earlier this year that proposed fee cuts for barristers, which caused criminal barristers to strike, would put high-profile cases such as the Rhys Jones trial in jeopardy. The government last month retreated on those proposals, raising fees again by 5%.</p>",
  "<p>The Iranian interior minister, Ali Kordan, has been sacked for deception, following an impeachment hearing for faking a degree from Oxford University.</p> <p>A total of 188 MPs out of the 247 present voted to impeach Kordan, who claimed he had been awarded an honorary doctorate of law by Oxford, while 14 were against the motion and 45 abstained.</p> <p>The bogus degree was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2008/aug/13/ali.kordan.oxford\">uncovered in August</a>, when MPs questioned the authenticity of Kordan's qualifications shortly after his appointment to the post of interior minister.</p> <p>Kordan produced the degree, dated June 2000, but its poor grammar only inflamed the controversy, as did the fact that none of the signatories had ever worked in law at Oxford.</p> <p>The university said it had \"no record of Mr Ali Kordan receiving an honorary doctorate or any other degree from the university.</p> <p>\"Professor Edmund Rolls, Professor Peter Bryant and Professor Alan Cowey have all at some stage held posts at the University of Oxford.

  "<h2>First blood to Obama</h2> <p>And so here we are. In accordance with tradition, voting opened at midnight eastern time, or 5am UK time, in Dixville Notch, New Hampshire today, and closed moments later, after the village's residents had gathered to cast their ballots in the ballroom of a local hotel. They voted overwhelmingly for Obama - by 15 votes to six. </p> <p>By the time the rest of America has voted, election officials expect <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/04/uselections2008-barackobama2\">the biggest turnout in the nation's history</a> -130-140 million voters, compared with 121 million in 2004, Ewen MacAskill writes in the Guardian today, bringing this gripping and unprecedented campaign to a close at last. Obama is well ahead in all the major polls, and there seems little doubt he will gain the 270 electoral college votes required to win. The question more frequently asked is whether he'll win by a landslide.</p> <p>The Democrats also seem on track to gain seven or eight more seats in the Senate, where they already hold 51 - a victory that could make governing effectively far easier for Obama than for some of his predecessors. Whatever happens tonight, the election campaign \"<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/04/us/politics/04memo.html\">has rewritten the rules</a> on how to reach voters, raise money, organize supporters, manage the news media, track and mould public opinion, and wage - and withstand - political attacks,\" writes Adam Nagourney in the New York Times The day brought sadness for Obama, though, in the midst of his rising confidence. His paternal grandmother, Madelyn Dunham, who raised him from the age of 10, died of cancer in Honolulu, a day before the nation voted on her grandson's candidacy. </p> <h2>What to watch for</h2> <p>A light day of campaigning.

  "<p>The kids on Myatts Field housing estate in Brixton never bought the government's line that violent crime has been falling for a decade. The shootings, stabbings and casual flashing of weaponry told them it was much higher, and it looks like they were right. </p> <p>Last month, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/oct/24/ukcrime-police\"> home office admitted</a> that a significant amount of serious violent crime had been downgraded in police reports for longer than anyone knows. Some police forces have been recording an attempt to kill or injure as \"serious violence against a person\" but others had decided that if the attacker didn't succeed, it wasn't so serious. The newly recalibrated figures show a 22% year-on-year increase in incidents of serious violence with intent to harm.</p> <p>There are also other question marks hanging over the statistics. A former home office crime consultant told the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7685908.stm\"> BBC</a> the government had been \"hiding behind\" its changes in the crime counting rules. Considering Labour made crime fighting a key promise during the 1997 election, it's no surprise to find that the government and opposition are arguing about what the figures really mean. </p> <p>But the argument is as pointless as the statistics are useless. While politicians sling and dodge mud, they waste the best opportunity in decades to address inner city crime. Whichever side of the political divide you sit on, there is no question that there is a major problem in inner cities. </p> <p>I spent a couple of months around various housing estates in London. Teenagers sitting in takeaways described another world where \"crews\" were involved in feuds and non-gang members were described as \"civilians\". I would ask about recently reported stabbings, or even murders, in the local area and be given a detailed description of what the victim had done to deserve his \"punishment\" or whether he was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. The catalogue of tit-for-tat violence resembles feuds in Pakistan's tribal areas. </p> <p>On Green Hills Estate in North London I met about 15 teenagers. All of them knew a victim of knife crime, many knew someone who had been killed, and all of them could help me find a gun. On Myatts Field Estate and in Angell Town in Brixton I met 14 and 15-year-olds who were \"youngers\" in the local gangs. They took orders from \"elders\" to hold up shops and attack rival gang members with knives, baseball bats and guns. </p> <p>They were too young to say whether their lives were surrounded by more violence than a decade ago, but they did think the cycle of violence in their neighbourhoods grew deadlier every few weeks. Even three years ago, one 15-year-old told me, a stabbing was serious. Now, you could get \"shanked\" for \"dissing\" someone's trainers or holding a stare a second too long. </p> <p>I met youngsters from different backgrounds. Some were black, some white, some from Pakistani families and others the children of refugees from Somalia and Iraq. All were intelligent and articulate, even if they couldn't read. They complained they had no youth clubs or sports centres. They had no faith that their constantly changing stand-by teachers could impart anything useful. </p> <p>They knew their lives were different from other teenagers who planned to go to university and take up \"suit jobs\". But instead of feeling envy, they took their disadvantages and infused them with a little ghetto romance. </p> <p>They took pride in, and even played up, the grottiness of their \"ends\" (areas) so they could compare them with the Bronx in New York or <a href=\"http://www.streetgangs.com/maps/southla_turf.html\">South Los Angeles</a>. Three 14-year-olds in West Norwood told me they expected to die before they were 20. The last place I heard such talk from teenagers was in the Palestinian Territories. But like the Palestinians, I don't think they understood what they were saying. They were just words that helped burnish the self-image that made their lives more livable. </p> <p>The social policies of the last couple of decades have failed Britain's inner cities. Young upwardly mobile professionals have bought homes in places like Brixton but their presence has done little for the children of the original residents apart from create low-paid, part-time jobs waiting tables in trendy cafes.</p> <p>The only remaining option is large-scale investment in educational as well as social infrastructure. And it looks like the coming recession could provide an opportunity for just that. </p> <p>The chancellor and prime minister have said the government will undertake <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financetopics/financialcrisis/3224890/Financial-crisis-Alistair-Darling-will-spend-his-way-out-of-recession.html\">large scale public spending</a> to counter the recession. But just throwing money around is not the answer. The families of these inner city communities need support and their local economies need to be rebuilt. </p> <p>Many of the youngsters I met referred to abusive family members with drink or drug problems, or parents with serious illness. Others talked about families that didn't speak English and had no idea of the tightrope their children walked to earn acceptance in today's street culture. </p> <p>All of the teenagers thought well-paying jobs could be found in the City, but they weren't for people like them. \"Rich people guard those jobs for their kids.\" But, they saw the trappings of luxury and were all agreed their only route to similar lifestyles would be through crime. </p> <p>As the economy recovers and the government looks at changing our previous economic model, which relied on financial services to power job and wealth creation, it might be worth helping small businesses in inner cities create meaningful employment that offers a livable wage. </p> <p>Properly paid and supported teachers, career advisors and social workers should be able to help youngsters understand and unlock the employment and educational opportunities that remained closed to their parents and older siblings. </p> <p>It's going to cost a lot of money. But if it looks like the government is going to spend it anyway, it's worth spending it on parts of the country that have needed it for a long time.</p>",

Photograph: Stephen Chernin/Getty</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephen Chernin/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Starbucks. Scourge of the left, succour of the commuter. Since it sprang into existence in Britain a decade ago, few companies have elicited such adoration, hatred and bemusement. For some, it's saved us from instant coffee and provided a bit of sophistication to the dreariest high street and for others it's the middle class face of McGlobalisation. The rest just wonder why glorified warm milk costs so much. <br><br>Starbucks are aware that they don't hold a special place in everyone's heart and are doing their best to make us all fall in love again. As <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/jul/01/starbucks.useconomy\">600 stores</a> prepare to close, Starbucks is in a vulnerable position. As belts tighten and purses remain closed, their luxury offerings are at risk.</p> <p>And so, while it may not make economic sense to go to Starbucks, the company want it to make social and environmental sense. It's all part of <a href=\"http://www.starbucks.com/sharedplanet/index.aspx new viral ad - http://www.facebook.com/video/video.php?v=104421780472\">Shared Planet</a>, the Starbucks initiative launched last week to show how good they are. \"It's our commitment to doing business in ways that are good to the earth and to each other\", they simper. A collection of goals, by 2015 they promise to have all their coffee ethically sourced and all their cups recyclable. Community is at the centre of Shared Planet, with pledges to contribute a million hours of community service and, again by 2015, to \"engage 50,000 social entrepreneurs to innovate and take action\". As with the names of their coffee, nothing is ever simple in Starbucks-speak. </p> <p>The launch of Shared Planet ties in nicely with the American election. With \"change\" America's watchword, Starbucks is keen to align itself with this message of renewal and hope. \"What if we all cared enough to vote?\" asks Starbucks new viral ad. Their answer: a better community, a better country, a better world. Their incentive: a free cup of coffee for every voter. \"It's bigger than coffee\", the advert ends. </p> <p>Britain also gets the free coffee, albeit in conjunction with vouchers printed in The Guardian rather than after exercising its democratic right. </p> <p>Of course, when you're as big as Starbucks, your problems can't just be solved with a well-timed coffee promotion and the company is hoping to go <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/30/business/30starbucks.html?ref=business\">back to its roots</a>, or at least as much as a multinational with 15,000 outlets can. Starbucks founder Howard Schultz was tempted back as Chairman and CEO in January and in turn persuaded retail expert Arthur Rubinfeld to return. Rubinfeld was previously in charge of d\u00e9cor and locations and will be remodelling exist stores to bring a bit of authenticity and nostalgia back to Starbucks interiors. </p> <p>A bit of redecorating is easy but its green makeover will be harder to convince people of. Grand rhetoric aside, the goals it has set itself aren't particularly lofty; does it really take seven years to introduce recyclable cups? And why has Starbucks dragged its feet over ethically-produced coffee for so long? Just last year Oxfam accused the coffee behemoth of \"bullying the poor\" when it came to buying <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2007/may/04/globalisation.ethicalliving\">coffee in Ethiopia</a>. Next month's<a href=\"http://www.starbucks.com/red/default.asp\"> link up with (RED)</a> seems particularly disingenuous considering the company's reputation. </p> <p>Aside from this, there's the matter of the company's dirty little habits. Last month <a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/article1771553.ece\">The Sun revealed</a> Starbucks' policy of keeping their taps running all day, wasting some 23m litres of water a day. It suggests that it might take more than <a href=\"http://www.starbucks.com/sharedplanet/index.aspx\">433 people pledging</a> to bring their own mugs to Starbucks if they want to change their practices, their image and people's minds.</p> <p><strong>Update: 14:00GMT</strong><br>Starbucks' great coffee giveaway has hit a snag. It's apparently <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&amp;sid=aIBd9wa0Xh7U&amp;refer=us\">illegal to offer any incentives for voting</a>. Still, <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hkZDug9EuV1uHWF1h8Rn1Wy4IagAD947QH1G0\">it hasn't deterred other companies</a> such as Krispy Kreme and Ben and Jerry's giving out freebies to voters. <a href=\"http://twitter.com/Starbucks/statuses/988526875\">Starbucks, meanwhile, have said</a>: \"To ensure that we are in compliance with election law, we are extending our offer to all customers who request a tall brewed drip.\" Free coffee for everyone. Yay for violations of election law.</p>",
  "<p>Cartoonists and photo librarians are already printing their farewell selections on George W Bush, and the Guardian's G2 has been giving him one last bashing or three \u2013 though the famous US presidential transition means Dubya still has three months to serve.</p> <p>But how bad a president has he been in the larger scheme of things? Who was the worst and indeed the best of the 43 elected since that remarkable constitution (unlike the EU's wordy jargon, it can be both read and understood in 20 minutes) was painstakingly constructed at Philadelphia in 1787? </p> <p>My views of the No 1 are pretty conventional, I'm afraid. I'm an Abraham Lincoln (1861-65) man, though George Washington (1789-97), wise and unflashy founding president of the republic, commands a good case. Eight years is enough for anyone, he realised, an enduring precedent, which even Vladimir Putin had to respect (sort of).</p> <p>Up there too is the man who breached it in exceptional circumstances: Franklin D Roosevelt (1933-45). He never gets enough credit, says me, for being the greatest political figure of the 20th century, the leader who mastered both the depression and global war against fearsome enemies without resort to tyranny or barbarism.</p> <p>But we can all play this game. As with sporting heroes, great movies and much else there are people who devote huge amounts of time to \"best of'' lists, as any Google search confirms. What I call <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_rankings_of_United_States_Presidents \">Wikipedia University</a> confirms that my trio usually takes the top three places, with Thomas Jefferson and Theodore Roosevelt \u2013 he wouldn't have cut those Wall St bankers so much slack \u2013 just behind them. That's cool with me too.</p> <p><a href=\" http://www.karemar.com/blog/top-10-united-states-presidents-all-time \">Here's another</a> I found easily, one which includes useful summaries of achievement and stirring quotes. JFK (1961-63) doesn't make the top 10, nor should he, but the compiler includes him as a \"personal favourite\". That's nice, but it's also a warning that \u2013 as with movies where recent duds often outshine enduring classics \u2013 we can all be misled by our own perspective.</p> <p>The Times \u2013 London, not New York - <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/us_elections/article5055404.ece\">took a crack at this one the other day</a>. A panel of Times pundits ranked all 42 (not 43 because Grover Cleveland got elected for two separate terms) with what I thought were some perverse results, especially in the back half.</p> <p>As Times posters were quick to protest, you can't put Richard Nixon (1969-74) at No 37. Yes, he was a seriously flawed man, paranoid and vengeful (a US chum says McCain would be the same), and driven from office for shocking misconduct, the only such president.</p> <p>But he was also a brilliant man who drew isolated China back into the international sphere and ended the Vietnam war. That had been messed up by Lyndon Johnson (1963-69) who makes the cut at No 12 for his domestic achievements, anti-poverty programmes, but above all the civil rights legislation, which has allowed Barack Obama to be where he is today. </p> <p>In doing so Johnson, the supreme political manipulator, admitted that the Democrats would \"lose the south for a generation\". True, though they may be about to get them back. But Johnson too was a flawed political genius for whom Bill Shakespeare would have got out his Olivetti, as he would for Nixon but few others among the 41-plus-Grover-and Grover. Most were fairly unremarkable men upon whom varying degrees of greatness were thrust.</p> <p>That's why Harry Truman (1945-53) usually comes out well. No one expected much of FDR's deputy, but he rose to the challenges he inherited. Yes, I know he dropped the atom bomb of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. Did it save many Japanese as well as American lives? I have always felt so, but others disagree.</p> <p>What about the bad guys? The Times puts James Buchanan (1857-61), the Democrat who dithered and drifted towards the bloody civil war that nearly destroyed the union, as No 42, a verdict echoed by other even weightier surveys. Franklin Pierce, his predecessor (1853-57), a drunk and incompetent, was placed second worst.</p> <p>Myself, I think Rutherford Hayes (1877-81), a Republican elected after a \"hanging chads\" kind of scandal in Florida, has a lot to answer for. As part of the deal which let him win the disputed election he pulled federal troops out of the occupied south and allowed racist Jim Crow laws to be re-established for the next 80 years.</p> <p>So does Warren Harding (1921-23) who presided over a post-war boom, marred by red-baiting attacks on civil liberties and spectacular corruption. </p> <p>Ulysses S Grant (1869-77) also tolerated the \"robber baron\" era and a depression. Being a great war-winning general was not enough, though another such, Dwight Eisenhower (1953-61), comes out better: a decent man who hated war and warned against the emergence of an over-powerful military-industrial complex. </p> <p>Under a weak president like Dubya it has become one of the greatest threats to American liberties \u2013 and by extension to our own. So how is George W Bush likely to fare at the hands of history?</p> <p>As with Ronald Reagan (No 8 in the Times list) and Bill Clinton (slapped down to No 23) it's all too soon to be clear. Reagan was very likeable, and his supporters claim he \"won\" the cold war against the USSR, which first crumbled on his watch. How significant was that? We don't yet know.</p> <p>Clinton, a man of great potential, was a disappointment. Yet he presided over a successful economy, unencumbered by the huge public debt, which both Bushes helped create. The Lewinsky affair was deplorable, but some of his tormentors in Congress were exposed for hypocrisy on a far bigger scale.</p> <p>George W Bush has particular problems. History's verdict on his Iraq war depends on how the Middle East evolves over the next 20 years and beyond. If more stable and successful states emerge, their citizens healthier, wealthier and happier, then the Bushites may claim some credit. </p> <p>And vice-versa. As for the post 9/11 \"war on terror\" it was misconceived and overblown. Domestic civil liberties suffered \u2013 most conspicuously at Guant\u00e1namo Bay \u2013 taking America's \"soft power\" reputation down around the world. The courts will one day declare the policy to have been unconstitutional.</p> <p>It's Bush's domestic economic record which may push him close to the bottom of the league \u2013 where many Americans already put him, albeit prematurely. He was dominated by highly ideological officials who slashed the wrong taxes for the wrong people (rich ones), allowed a budget surplus to become a huge deficit and spent like drunken sailors. </p> <p>Worse, an unsustainable boom turned into the past year's dramatic bust. Rightwing free market theorists have been forced to nationalise banks. If that all wasn't enough there was the shameful neglect of Hurricane Katrina: another avoidable bust which destroyed much of the great American city that was New Orleans.</p> <p>So President Obama or President McCain \u2013 my caution persists until the votes are all counted - will inherit a heavy burden, with expectations on the frontrunner recklessly high. George W has been hidden throughout much of the campaign. You could almost feel sorry for him.</p> <p>But hey's this is America. So let's end as Americans try to do, on an optimistic note. Lincoln was the country's greatest president because he was a leader who combined low political cunning, the ability to master men and events, with heady rhetoric and a moral vision expressed in simple, stirring English, the language of the King James Bible, Shakespeare and the founding fathers. He saved the union \u2013 what he called 'the last, best hope of mankind\".</p> <p>If you haven't read Lincoln's <a href=\"http://showcase.netins.net/web/creative/lincoln/speeches/gettysburg.htm\">Gettysburg Address lately, here it is</a>, delivered in 1863 on the site of a bloody, recent battlefield where the confederacy's last attempt to split the union north of Washington. Just 272 words, mocked (by the London Times!) as inadequate at the time, it's what we'd now call a pretty good Victorian soundbite. </p> <p>I like to think that Honest Abe, up there on his cloud, will be watching the count tonight, along with the countless million ghosts of the Atlantic slave trade. Who'd have thought it, eh?</p>",
  "<p>This week, as ever, it's one step forward and two steps back for the recording industry's anti-piracy legislation. Even as France seems poised to pass a new \"three strikes\" law against filesharers, lobbyists in Denmark have given up on the chance of passing similar legislation.</p> <p>On Monday, the French senate voted 297 to 15 in favour of a law that penalises illegal filesharers by cutting off their internet access. Under the legislation, internet providers would be forced to act as watchdogs, monitoring their customers' internet traffic for signs of copyright infringement. Anyone caught illegally sharing music, movies or games would receive two warnings before having their account terminated.</p> <p>When the law was first proposed by President Nicolas Sarkozy in 2007, he called it \"a decisive moment for the future of a civilised internet\". It now passes to the French National Assembly for final approval.</p> <p>The French senate decision runs contrary to the greater European trend. This spring, MEPs voted against such \"three strikes\" legislation, calling it a violation of \"civil liberties and human rights\". And while Sweden is following France's lead and considering harsher anti-piracy laws, Denmark has gone the other way. For all the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry's [IFPI] lobbying efforts, Danish politicians seem close to an outright rejection. \"We have to deal with the political reality that there will be no 'three strikes' [law in Denmark],\" an IFPI representative admitted to Comon magazine this week. </p> <p>Pirates meanwhile are continuing to hoist the Jolly Roger. Users of Pirate Bay, the world's largest public BitTorrent tracker, are at an all-time high. Pirate Bay now tracks more than 20m unique peers, according to TorrentFreak, including many thousands of Danes, Swedes and French people. Maybe the IFPI ought to switch sides.</p>",

In Hart's Location they voted 17 to 10 in Obama's favour, with two voters going for the libertarian candidate, Ron Paul. The Independent candidate, Ralph Nader, got no votes in either village.</p> <p>The village also identified the very first voter in the election to be Tanner Nelson Tillotson, after his name was drawn out of a bowl. He said he voted for Obama and \"wasn't surprised\" by the candidate's win.</p> <p>Dixville Notch had only voted for a Democratic candidate once before. In 1968 it bucked the national trend by voting for Hubert Humphrey rather than the Republican Richard Nixon, who went on to win the election.</p> <p>The villages take pride in getting every voter to the polls at midnight on election day. Each voter gets an individual booth so there are no queues.</p> <p>While New Hampshire law requires polls to open at 11am at the latest, the state allows towns to open polls earlier and then close once all registered and eligible voters have cast their ballots.</p> <p>Dixville Notch has been the first to announce its votes since 1948.</p> <p>Hart's Location grew weary of the publicity of early voting and ended the tradition in 1964, but brought it back again in 1996.</p> <p>The tradition began so as to allow railway workers to vote before their early morning shifts.</p>",
  "<p>Bon Jovi may be the most sued band in the world. Mere weeks after a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/oct/14/job-bon-jovi-sued\">$400bn copyright suit</a> was brought against the group by a Boston songwriter, a Milton Keynes woman is now suing them for injuries suffered when a crew member ran over her with a golf buggy.</p> <p>Sarah Allen alleges that she was working as a security supervisor at the National Bowl, Buckinghamshire, during a Bon Jovi concert in 2006. When a fire broke out in the VIP zone, Allen was deployed as part of a security cordon preventing backstage access. Kevin McDonnell, a member of Bon Jovi's personal security team, approached, demanded access, and then drove his golf buggy straight over her right leg.</p> <p>According to documents presented at court, Allen suffered a fractured knee, ligament damage and severe internal injuries. She spent almost a week in hospital and has been unable to work since the incident. But the buggy's impact was more than just physical \u2013 Allen claims that the injuries destroyed her sex life, undermined her marriage, threw her into depression and made her nearly lose her home. </p> <p>Now she is holding the entire band accountable, suing Jon Bon Jovi, David Bryan, Richie Sambora and Tico Torres in papers filed at Oxford County Court. Allen blames the New Jersey hair-rockers for failing to train or control McDonnell - and demands \u00a3250,000 in compensation and damages.</p> <p>\"I don't care about your emergency situation,\" McDonnell allegedly said to her. \"Get out of my way, you fucking whore.\"</p> <p>Allen approached Thames Valley Police at the time of the 2006 episode, but McDonnell had apparently already left the US, making it difficult for Allen's legal team to trace him. Though she tried to make her case in America, a court there ruled that they had no jurisdiction over the English incident.</p> <p>\"But if we found out that [McDonnell] was back in this country,\" the investigating officer told the Daily Telegraph, \"there is nothing to stop us arresting him and interviewing him about the alleged attack.\"</p> <p>Bon Jovi's representatives dismissed her allegations. \"None of the band members were present when she blocked the pathway of a crew member, nor were they aware of any disturbance at the time,\" they said in a statement. \"Mrs Allen's claim in England follows a claim she attempted to file in the United States, which was rejected.\"</p> <p>The case will be heard next year.</p>",
  "<p>We were expecting it, but the deafening noise of the first sound bomb still came as a shock. The cry went up, \"gas, gas\", and blue-white smoke hissed out from a tear gas grenade.</p> <p>\"No violence. No violence,\" someone shouted. \"Hold your hands in the air.\" But the gesture was not reciprocated. The grenades kept coming, perhaps 20 in all. Fortunately the wind carried most of the gas away across the fields.</p> <p>Standing in the clear air between two spouting grenades I pressed a European Union flag against the fence and shouted to the soldiers: \"This is Palestinian land. You are breaking international law. How can you hope for peace and security if you steal the land of the Palestinians?\" A gate was opened and Israeli troops came through, pointing guns, barging and shoving the 100 or so protestors, forcing them backwards down the gravel path.

The European Commission reports that the population of the settlements has grown by 5% since January alone. Military fortifications, impassable fences, and new connecting roads are separating Palestinian communities and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jan/18/westbankbantustan\">turning them into bantustans</a> (but even white South Africans never forbade blacks from using the roads). A Soviet-style system of identity passes restricts movement and prevents families from meeting.</p> <p>Britain and the European Union criticise all these Israeli actions. But words are cheap: we take no steps to enforce our views. Instead we salve our consciences by contributing money to keep the Palestinian Authority functioning. Taxes from European citizens are being used to pick up the tab for expenses that are wholly the responsibility of the Israeli occupying power. By providing a salve we help to perpetuate the injustice.</p> <p>What does Israel really want in the long term? The Israeli extreme right are open in their desire for \"ethnic cleansing\", but no Palestinian believes that even Israelis like prime ministerial candidate <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/18/israelandthepalestinians.middleeast1\">Tzipi Livni</a>, who talk of a two-state solution, envisage co-existing alongside a genuinely independent and viable Palestinian entity.</p> <p>Two days after the protests at Bil'in I took my seat in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/aug/22/israel.artsnews\">Ramallah Cultural Palace</a>, a 736-seat auditorium that reminded me of the Philharmonic Hall in Liverpool. It was presentation night for the Palestine Awards for Excellence and Creativity. Talented young musicians entertained us between the applause for business people and innovators, for teachers and sports competitors, and for individuals whose achievements against the odds set an example for all.</p> <p>It was not the sort of occasion that people across the world have come to associate with Palestine. It reminded me that the heartfelt wish of most Palestinians is simply to say to the Israelis: \"Please go away, leave us the land that was ours in 1967, and just let us get on with our lives.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Republican vice presidential candidate, Sarah Palin, has been cleared of wrong-doing in the \"troopergate\" controversy by a report released on the eve of the US election.</p> <p>Palin did not apply improper pressure to try to dismiss a state trooper who was her former brother-in-law, and did not violate state ethics laws in the firing of her state public safety commissioner, according to the report by the Alaska Personnel Board.</p> <p>The report contradicts a separate inquiry by a bipartisan legislative panel, which concluded that she abused her office.</p> <p>The personnel board's report said it found \"no probable cause to believe that the governor, or any other state official\", violated Alaska's executive ethics laws.</p> <p>Palin's lawyer, Thomas Van Flein, said in a statement that she was pleased the board had concluded that she acted properly in the \"reassignment\" of Walt Monegan, Alaska's former public safety commissioner.</p> <p>Monegan said he felt pressure from Palin, her husband and her staff to fire a state trooper who had gone through a nasty divorce from Palin's sister. Palin denied the claim, and said Monegan was fired last July because she wanted the department to head in a new direction.</p> <p>Monegan told the Associated Press that he was \"perplexed and disappointed\" by the report.-</p> <p>\"It conflicts with the first investigation and then casts doubts on both of them. So, it doesn't really resolve anything,\" he said. \"If it did, then I could walk away. It does seem to fly in the face of circumstantial evidence.\"</p> <p>The earlier investigation by the Legislative Council concluded that Palin abused her office by allowing her husband and staffers to pressure Monegan to fire the trooper, Mike Wooten. </p> <p>The latest report was prepared by Timothy Petumenos, an independent investigator for the Alaska Personnel Board.</p> <p>Petumenos said his conclusions differ from the report by the legislative panel's investigator, former prosecutor Stephen Branchflower, because the earlier probe assumed facts without having all relevant data at hand. He said Branchflower used a wrong statute as the basis for his conclusions, misconstrued the available evidence and did not consider or obtain all the material evidence to reach a proper finding.</p> <p>Petumenos said the personnel board's investigation included much more data, including additional emails from state personnel, including Palin. And while some of Palin's personal emails were obtained, he said, it was impossible to know if any had been deleted.</p> <p>The report recommends that the state addresses the issue of personal email use to conduct state business.</p> <p>\"Also absent from the evidence reviewed is any assertion that the governor directed anyone in the Department of Public Safety to terminate Trooper Wooten, or directed anyone on her staff to seek the termination of Trooper Wooten,\" the report said.</p> <p>State senator Kim Elton, chairman of the Legislative Council that conducted the earlier investigation, said the personnel board report omitted a lot of context in the matter. </p> <p>Elton added: \"I think we have two lawyers who reached different conclusions on the law.\"</p> <p>Alaska Personnel Board investigations are normally secret, but the three-member panel decided to release this report, citing public interest in the issue.</p>",
  "<p>If the United States today elects an African American man to the presidency, that event will mark a turning point in US history and culture. It will genuinely represent a triumph of hope over fear - all the more so because Barack Obama for the most part ran a dignified and inclusive campaign, in the face of the hateful and divisive rhetoric of John McCain. It's significance cannot be overstated, Yet, as Ken Silverstein of Harpers observes, an Obama victory is \"not about politics but about the man.\" Ironically, Obama may transform the face and spirit of a nation, without dramatically changing the substance of its policies.</p> <p>As everyone knows, Obama is a cautious politician. He doesn't look like a leader who is ready to launch anything as bold as FDR's New Deal. But then, Roosevelt didn't initially look like that kind of leader, either. Perhaps if Obama wins the White House he will be emboldened by the remarkable groundswell of support that put him there. Perhaps he will be one of those men who has greatness thrust upon him, and will become fully worthy of the faith and optimism that so many millions have invested in him.<br> But in the humdrum world of political reality, what happens in the coming years will depend a great deal upon the behind-the-scenes workings of Congress, without which significant change cannot take place. All the polls indicate the Democrats will increase their majorities in both the House and Senate, but whether the character and direction of Congress changes is hard to predict. Since they gained control of Congress in 2006, the Democrats have been careful and conservative. Although they ran against the war in 2006, congressional Democrats voted to continue the war. Despite perennial calls for healthcare reform, the only program that actually materialized came from Republicans, in the highly compromised form of Medicare drug subsidies for the elderly. The Democrats promised to root out corruption and malfeasance, and while much has been exposed under the leadership of Henry Waxman and a few others, the exposure so far has resulted in few real consequences and little change. Social welfare programs have been cut back and state government budgets have continued haemorrhaging. As for the roots of the current financial crisis, the Democrats, if the truth be told, largely stood by while the financial regulatory structure established during the New Deal was dismantled. Some, like those in Bill Clinton's treasury department, were in fact all too eager to lend a hand.</p> <p>Some of these facts can be blamed on the presence of a rightwing Republican in the White House and a Democratic congressional majority too slim to survive a Senate filibuster, much less a presidential veto. Others, mostly likely, have deeper causes. What obstacles to real change would remain with a Democratic president and a stronger majority in Congress?</p> <p>\u2022 In Iraq, it means mustering a sizeable coalition that can implement a policy to bring the troops home. But does that mean leaving Iraq altogether? Probably not. The key to Iraq has always been oil, and we still need the oil. One way or another, obtaining that oil will depend on divvying up what were under Saddam nationalized reserves and putting them into the hands of the international oil companies, returning essentially to the days at the beginning of the 20th century when those companies created a cartel. The US military already has set down a long-term policy of maintaining permanent bases in the region. That is unlikely to change any time soon, although meaningful changes in energy policy could begin to gradually have their effect. As for Afghanistan, the west has tried without success to dominate the place for centuries. A stalemate is likely to continue indefinitely.</p> <p>\u2022 The debate over universal healthcare has been carried on nonstop since before Medicare was enacted in the 1960s. Everyone in Washington knows the clear course here: improve and extend Medicare to everyone. To make that work, the government must reign in the drug prices and eliminate the participation of the insurance industry. But the unwritten deal on Capitol Hill is that token reforms - getting rid of the gap in Medicare Part D, for example, or negotiating better drug prices - can be discussed, but only if everyone agrees to the participation of the insurance and pharmaceutical companies. Only the most incremental changes, therefore, are even remotely possible.</p> <p>\u2022 The financial mess requires direct government participation in reorganising defaulting mortgages with public financing if need be. It requires reinstatement in one form or another of the New Deal Glass Steagall Act that separated investment banking from banking. And most of all it requires a drastic reform in the Federal Reserve System, the central bank that is run not by Congress but by the banking industry. Wall Street is unlikely to stand for any of these changes - and a Congress and a president with campaigns so lavishly financed by the finance industry is unlikely to force them through. The Democrats will undoubtedly pursue some modest regulatory improvements, but nothing like what $700bn ought to buy.</p> <p>\u2022 Finally, creating a fairer and sounder tax system would mean taking on the formidable bloc of conservative Democrats in the House. These fiscal conservatives can be counted on to join with conservative Republicans to fight for fiscal conservative measures which in the past often end up as cuts to the social welfare programs.</p> <p>What might happen under an Obama presidency is certainly a preferable alternative to the warmongering free-market free-for-all promised by John McCain. But the promised change, when it boils down to policy, will be modest, slow, and hard-won - and no doubt disappointing to some who expected more of the new world they worked so hard to create.</p>",
  "<p><strong>November 3 session</strong></p> <p><strong>Quentin Davies</strong><br>Defence equipment minister Quentin Davies apologised for any offence caused after he appeared to dismiss concerns raised by a resigning SAS officer. He told MPs he had said sorry to Des Feely, father of corporal Sarah Bryant, the first female soldier to be killed in Afghanistan, after Feely accused him of insulting the memory of those who have fallen in the conflict.</p> <p>Davies had previously described Major Sebastian Morley's accusation that the MoD was guilty of \"gross negligence\" for failing to supply better kit as a \"travesty\". He also said casualties sometimes resulted after commanders chose the wrong kit for operations.</p> <p>The shadow defence secretary, Liam Fox, labelled the comments as a \"disgrace\" which amounted to an \"arrogant dismissal of a loyal and committed officer\".</p> <p><strong>Snatch Vixen vehicles in Afghanistan</strong><br>The more heavily-armoured replacement for Snatch Land Rovers will still be hit by fatal roadside bombs, armed forces minister Bob Ainsworth predicted. He said insurgents in Afghanistan would come up with explosives that would be able to overpower the new Snatch Vixen. It was impossible to \"entirely remove the risk\" from active theatre.</p> <p><strong>Iraq</strong><br>Britain's \"enduring defence relationship\" with Iraq is likely to be based around training the country's officers and helping nurture its navy, the defence secretary, John Hutton, said. He told MPs he was confident of a \"very significant change\" in mission but that there would \"certainly\" be a role to play in supporting the Iraqi armed forces after that.</p> <p><strong>Nuclear weapons</strong><br>Hutton denied the atomic weapons establishment in Aldermaston was being used for the development of new nuclear weapons. But he said it was \"vitally necessary\" for Britain to maintain the \"minimum nuclear deterrent\".</p> <p><strong>Congo crisis</strong><br>The foreign secretary, David Miliband, was urged to make a Commons statement on the crisis in the Congo. Labour's Jeremy Corbyn (Islington N) said a number of MPs had raised concerns about the \"horror going on in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo\" at the present time.<br>But Speaker Michael Martin said it was not a matter for him and up to ministers whether a statement was made or not.</p> <p>The government is \"holding in reserve\" the possibility of sending UK troops to the DRC as part of a European peacekeeping force, Foreign Office minister Lord Malloch-Brown said.</p> <p><strong>Military security passes</strong><br>Almost 10,000 military security passes were lost or stolen in the last year, Ainsworth disclosed. He said the service identity cards, which are used to gain access to MoD sites, were reported missing between September 1, 2007 and September 30 this year. Ainsworth said 9,667 of the cards issued to service personnel were lost or stolen.</p> <p><strong>Laser surgery for short-sighted troops</strong><br>Short-sighted troops fighting on the front line should be given free laser eye surgery, Nick Harvey, for the Liberal Democrats, urged. He said the government should follow the US lead. Hutton promised to look into the matter but said ministers took advice from the surgeon general on such issues.</p> <p><strong>Afghanistan</strong><br>Labour MPs demanded that ministers reveal how much of Afghanistan is under the control of the Afghan government and its British and Nato allies. Labour's Paul Flynn (Newport W) said more British soldiers had now been killed than were in the Charge of the Light Brigade in a conflict that had lasted longer than both world wars.</p> <p>Ainsworth said the mission in Afghanistan was a counter-insurgency operation and was not \"straightforward\". He added: \"It is about winning the hearts and minds of the people and controlling territory is only part of that.\"</p> <p><strong>Dormant bank accounts</strong><br>There is still \"uncertainty\" about how a government scheme to use money from dormant bank accounts to fund good causes will operate, Tory spokesman Mark Hoban claimed. He called for a series of reviews into how the plan works once it is set up under the dormant banks and building society accounts bill.</p> <p>The Treasury economic secretary, Ian Pearson, said the government had been persuaded that a \"comprehensive\" review was necessary. A new clause to the bill commits ministers to review the scheme within three years and will cover \"the effectiveness of the money inside the scheme\" including banks' efforts to reunite people with their cash before accounts become dormant.</p> <p><strong>Inquiry into alleged leak of banks rescue package</strong><br>Claims that the government's banks rescue package was leaked in advance of the chancellor's statement last month, prompting further falls in bank shares, should be investigated by the Financial Services Authority, the Treasury financial services secretary, Lord Myners, said. He rejected calls for a government inquiry, telling Tory ex-cabinet minister Lord Forsyth of Drumlean: \"This is not an issue on which I can comment. It is a matter for the FSA.\"</p> <p><strong>Social networking sites and hate crimes</strong><br>Social networking sites are to be used by the government to encourage people to report hate crimes, the Home Office signalled. Junior minister Alan Campbell revealed that the head of the government's Race For Justice programme Superintendent Paul Giannasi was \"urgently\" meeting with the Metropolitan police about the scheme. A report on the feasibility and cost of the new reporting mechanism would then be considered by police minister Vernon Coaker.</p>",
  "<p>Women in the Netherlands who are deemed by the state to be unfit mothers should be sentenced to take contraception for a prescribed period of two years, according to a <a href=\"http://www.telegraaf.nl/vrouw/actueel/article2323628.ece?cid=rss\">draft bill</a> before the Dutch parliament.</p> <p>The proposed legislation would further punish parents who defied it by taking away their newborn infant. \"It targets people who have been the subject of judicial intervention because of their bad parenting,\" explained the author of the bill <a href=\"http://www.marjovandijken.pvda.nl/\">Marjo Van Dijken</a> of the socialist <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(Netherlands)\">PvDA</a>. \"If someone refuses the contraception and becomes pregnant, the child must be taken away directly after birth.\"</p> <p>When I see how some parents treat their children and come across adults who wish they'd never been born because of the abuse they endured as kids, I get some idea of where Van Dijken is coming from, but her proposed solution strikes me as far too draconian.</p> <p>In fact, I have serious misgivings about the implications of this proposed law, and it raises a torrent of questions in my mind. Is it really the state's role to protect the unborn and does it have the right to control people's bodies in such a way and to deprive them of the basic right to procreate? Whatever happened to the presumption of innocence? Just because a parent was bad with one child, does it mean (s)he will repeat the offence? </p> <p>Have we got the right to exercise pre-emptive \"justice\" \u2013 and could this be the first step towards a \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_Report_(film)\">minority report</a>\" approach to parental \"precrime\"? And, perhaps, given the Dutch penchant for social engineering, this could prove to be the prelude for the professionalisation of parenting, where in the distant future only certified and trained \"fathers\" and \"mothers\" would be allowed to raise children in special facilities.</p> <p>Less fantastically, could this not be the first step down a slippery slope? This government may have all the best intentions, but what's to guarantee that a future government doesn't use the law, or an amendment of it, to target \"undesirable\" groups, such as Roma, gays, religious minorities and immigrants?</p> <p>More immediately, there's the question of how we would define the \"unfit parents\" who should be deprived from the right to bear children. Should the law apply only to parents who pose a clear and present danger to potential offspring or could it be more loosely interpreted to apply to those of whose parenting style the state disapproves? </p> <p>Even if the law does save legions of notional children the trauma of neglectful parenting and abuse, how about all those parents it unfairly condemns? Surely, not all people who have ill-treated their children will raise their future offspring badly. Some will learn from their mistakes or be prompted by remorse to do better. Others will have mistreated their children because of temporary factors, such as depression or a nervous breakdown, the break-up of a relationship, or the loss of a job and other social deprivations.</p> <p>\"I find this is going way too far,\" <a href=\"http://zwanger.blog.nl/politiek/2008/10/29/wanneer-ben-je-een-falende-moeder-verplicht-prikpil-van-dijken-wetsvoorstel\">exclaimed</a> one Dutch blogger. \"That's may be because I experienced how my own sister could not take care of her son as a consequence of postnatal depression\u2026 Was she such a bad mother that, in the future, she can't determine for herself whether or not to have another child?\"</p> <p>I must admit that it shocked me that this law was the brainchild of a socialist. As a confounded psychiatrist friend who deals with troubled children put it, this bill is vaguely reminiscent of the eugenics and sterilisation programmes of the fascist era.</p> <p>Rather than the altruistic goal of protecting children, one friend thinks that this legislative proposal, which is likely to be defeated, is an attempt to steal the populist thunder of the far right in a society that has veered significantly rightwards in recent years. Another hidden objective could be to reduce the cost to the state of caring for abused children.</p> <p>Luckily, this ill-conceived law, according to legal experts, contravenes the Dutch constitution and the European Charter of Fundamental Rights, and will hopefully be defeated on the floor of the parliament.</p>",
  "<p>Has social mobility increased under a Labour government? Reading <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/nov/03/socialexclusion-gordonbrown-social-mobility-labour\">recent headlines</a> you would think that we are finally emerging into a new more fluid society, where individual talents rather than family background dictate how people get on in life. The truth, however, is much less exciting. <br> As far as we can tell the prospects of mobility for Labour's true children \u2013 born just after the millennium \u2013 are about the same as those born a generation ago. These are the youngsters who have lived their entire lives under New Labour. In fact, the rather depressing picture painted by the vast majority of research, looking at social class differences or earnings over a number of years, is of a world of unchanging, stagnant social mobility.  Today's claims of rising mobility are based on one study of children born in 1990 who took their GCSEs in 2006. The researchers suggest that the income of the children's parents is less important in predicting success in GCSEs than for a previous generation born in 1970. However, what the research will not be able to say is whether this trend was due to what happened during the children's lives up to age seven (under a Conservative government), or after age seven (under a Labour government). This highlights one of the fundamental problems when social mobility research collides with the world of political debate. Political parties are, understandably, keen to show that their policies are helping people to climb the social ladder and get on in life. It is just that conclusive facts are extremely hard to come by quickly.  We will only know for sure whether mobility increased under Labour in a generation's time \u2013 when we can track what happens to adults born during this decade. And even then, the vast majority of research can only speculate on the actual causes or drivers of mobility. Just to confuse matters further, we will never know what would have happened to mobility if the government hadn't introduced particular policies or programmes (what researchers call the \"counter-factual\"). The <a href=\"http://www.suttontrust.com/index.asp\">Sutton Trust</a> argues that mobility could, and should be higher in this country. International comparisons of mobility show that the UK is among the worst performers in the world. For example, in England, a child's test score is more strongly predicted by their parents' educational achievements than in any other country for which data are available. Other studies on adult outcomes suggest that we lag behind more mobile nations such as Sweden or Canada.<br> And most compellingly of all, the research points to a huge wastage of talent in the country. We know that those same millennium children from low-income backgrounds who performed so well in tests at age two are, by age six or seven, overtaken in the cognitive rankings by previously less able children from higher-income families.  It is surely good that social mobility has become one of the key political battlegrounds because, at its core, it is about the value we place on fairness in society. But no one should be fooled into thinking there can be any quick fixes. Improving mobility is a monumental challenge to be won or lost, not over a few parliamentary terms, but over a lifetime. The genuine champions of a more fluid, dynamic society must put aside short-term political gains, and be in it for the long haul.</p>",

  "<p>Canvassing for Obama in the Florida Keys: Conch Harbour, Pecan Lane, Rose Lane, Hurricane Alley \u2013 every street I canvass I get the same story. For instance: I ask for James \"Two Star\" Scott, a name on the list of registered voters given to me by the Obama campaign office. And I am told: \"He comes and goes.\" Finally out of exasperation I ask: \"Comes and goes! What do you mean he comes and goes?\"</p> <p>Turns out that all these guys are boat captains who come and go: to Bermuda, Bahama, Key Largo. I am in Key West and the references are all Caribbean. I am 80 miles from Havana and 124 miles from mainland America. To get here we drove over miles of ocean linked by Keys, the spectacular archipelago of islands off southern Florida: Sugarloaf Key, Duck Key, No Name Key, where anti-Cuban guerrillas trained in the 60s.</p> <p>The pace for volunteers here isn't as hectic as in the mainland offices but there is a sense of urgency. We are told that we need to deliver the Keys for Obama in order to balance the Republican vote in the northern I-4 corridor of Florida that stretches from Tampa to Orlando.</p> <p>Hence the days spent walking up and down the island to ensure every registered Democrat votes. Fifty per cent have already done so under the early voting scheme and the numbers so far are favouring Obama approximately 60-40 in the Upper Keys; in the Lower Keys it is reversed to McCain 60-40. The scales could tip either way. </p> <p>Part of the reason Florida is in play at all is because of the campaign's tremendous field-based effort to build voter lists through the \"Votebuilder\" data-bank, and because of the Democratic national committee's <a href=\"http://www.democrats.org/a/party/a_50_state_strategy/\">50-state strategy</a> under Howard Dean's leadership. In addition to the GOTV effort, the Obama campaign is taking no chances on election day: lawyers are being sent to every polling station to make sure there are no dirty tricks this time around.</p> <p>Though in Key West, the <a href=\"http://www.keysnet.com/news/story/29904.html\">hanky panky</a> seems to be of a different sort. The Sheriff has just been outed for doing \"nooners\" with his secretary; someone running for a district Mosquito Board turns out to have been <a href=\"http://www.kwtn-blue.com/2008/10/jailed-bug-board.html\">a porn star</a>; constitutional amendment No 2 takes away healthcare benefits and other protections for unmarried partners but has been misleadingly worded as the \"Florida Marriage Protection\" amendment.</p> <p>The reason any of this is relevant is because all these issues are on the ballot list, where in the Keys, in addition to picking the president, you also get to voice your opinion on eight constitutional amendments and on candidates running for everything from the Mosquito Board to sheriff, circuit judge to Congress.</p> <p>I am not having much luck with my list of voters. The next one I meet tells me that he can't vote because he has a felony for laying out crab traps. I think he must be pulling my leg, so I ring up the Obama office to check. Turns out that in Florida even once you have served your time you have to apply to the governor to have your rights reinstated. Without that permission you can't vote, among other things.</p> <p>There seem to be quite a few people just out of prison here. Along with a vibrant gay community, Cubans, Jews, a lot of retirees, an old Bahamanian community of blacks and whites who have been here for over 150 years, and other \"conchs\" (islanders who have been here here for generations).</p> <p>In the midst of my canvassing, I naughtily sneak in a 20-minute break to check out the 19th century house of one such conch, <a href=\"http://www.heritagehousemuseum.org/html/jessie.htm\">Miss Jessie Porter</a>, famous for her dinner parties with guests such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tallulah_Bankhead\">Tallulah Bankhead</a>, <a href=\"http://www.imagi-nation.com/moonstruck/clsc9.htm\">Tennessee Williams</a>, <a href=\"http://www.timelesshemingway.com/faq/faq1.shtml#briefbio\">Ernest Hemingway</a> and Robert Frost. Key West is a great place to relax. The streets are lined with palms, banyans, bougainvilleas and hibiscus, the clapboard houses have southern-colonial style wrap-around lace porches, elaborate confections in pastel pinks, violets and pistachios. Laid back during the day and a carnivale atmosphere in the evenings, pina coladas and Key Lime pies.</p> <p>We are very spoilt volunteers. An Obama supporter who owns a hotel, appropriately named Eden House, is putting us up. In this Floridian Art Deco hotel from the 1920s, we have a hammock outside our room, a book on Buddhism on our bedside table, palm trees and an azure sky to admire. People see us with our Obama signs and beckon us into their shops to chat about politics. Mr Johnson of the Johnson Grocery Store, a Bahamanian in his 50s whose family has been here for generations, gives me a postcard on which he writes: \"Nur, god bless you.\" On Duval Street, a teenager who is too young to vote and is working at an ice cream parlour gives me a vanilla custard ice-cream in support of Obama.</p> <p>What will we do once the election is over? It has been a gift outright to see America in this way. These words are in my mind, as I have just read <a href=\"http://www.poemhunter.com/poem/the-gift-outright/\">The Gift Outright</a>, the poem that Robert Frost wrote at Miss Jessie's house and recited at John F Kennedy's inauguration. Now, so as not to end on some soppy note, back to knocking doors for Obama.</p>",
  "<p>Most people will be too carried away by the relentless action in the latest Bond film to notice the background, but design-minded viewers will find it more exciting than most. It's unlikely to go down as the best Bond ever, but <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/122628/quantum.of.solace\">Quantum of Solace</a> wins hands down when it comes to best architecture. </p> <p>Perhaps it's because he's Swiss, but director Marc Forster certainly has an eye for a good building, usually a piece of hard-edged European modernism with a conveniently flat roof. A key location, for example, is the <a href=\"http://www.truevenue.com/en/locations/detail.php?id=973\"> Festival House Bregenz</a>, in Austria - a dauntingly sophisticated ensemble of steel cladding and huge glass windows that opens out on to a spectacular open-air amphitheatre facing the lake, with the stage in the middle of the water. Designed by Austrian architect <a href=\"http://www.dietrich.untertrifaller.com/project.php?id=161&amp;type=KULTUR&amp;lang=en\"> Dietrich Untertrifaller</a>, it's the perfect venue for a covert mid-opera meeting of arch-villains. It's also great for crane shots, tuxedo-clad shootouts, and the odd rooftop punch-up. Forster seems to have passed up on another local landmark, mind you: the <a href=\"http://www.kunsthaus-bregenz.at\"> Kunsthaus Bregenz</a>, designed by his revered compatriot Peter Zumthor. Perhaps it just didn't have enough places to plug in a Klieg light. </p> <p>Elsewhere we get a precarious chase over the terracotta tiled roofscape of Siena, a brief tour of London's Barbican, some grand colonial buildings in Panama, even a car chase through Italy's Carrara marble quarry - birthplace of Rome's Pantheon, among others. Topping the bill, though, is the <a href=\"http://www.eso.org/public/outreach/bond/Residencia.html\"> ESO Paranal Residencia</a> in Chile, where the traditional climactic rendezvous between Bond and his nemesis takes place. In reality, this stunning building is a hostel for astronomers at the European Organisation for Astronomical Research in the Southern Hemisphere. Designed by German architects Auer and Weber it's a fine choice: a long rectangular strip of a building, sunk into the barren landscape that contains a splendid indoor garden and swimming pool lit by a 35-metre glass dome. Being situated in the middle of the Atacama desert, 2,400 metres above sea level, it's a place very few of us are likely to ever see inside for real, so here's your chance. Be dazzled by the rhythmic concrete facades! Thrill to the earth-toned interiors! Swoon over the long internal perspectives. Salivate over the minimal detailing! Then watch it all get blown to smithereens!</p> <p>Yes, almost inevitably, the building does not survive its encounter with Bond, and as he saunters away from its smoking ruins, it occurred to me that few buildings ever do. Bond movies invariably end like Quantum: with 007 single-handedly trashing not only the plans of would-be world dominators but also their hideouts, which is a pity because most of them are rather splendid. Think of the stupendous submersible lair of Stromberg in the Spy Who Loved Me with its circular underwater windows and 2001-style furniture, the hollowed-out volcano in <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062512/\">You Only Live Twice</a>, the vertiginous control room in Moonraker, the elegant, if structurally unfeasible, ice palace in Die Another Day, and so forth. Some of the low-rent Bond baddies settle for oil rigs and such, but whatever the villain's crib of choice, you can guarantee it's going to get exploded. Those villains tend to put a great deal of effort into their bachelor pads, recruiting tasteful but evil architects, contractors, interior designers etc - it can't be easy. Then along comes Bond. The villains are the creators; Bond is the destroyer. He's basically an enemy of architecture. </p> <p>Even beyond the villains' lairs, Bond is a menace to the built environment. Think back to Casino Royale. For once there was no hideout at the end, so what does Bond do? He demolishes a priceless Venetian palazzo instead, not just smashing it up but actually sinking it into the lagoon. That seemed like an awful lot of damage to inflict in the name of a $150m theft, or whatever it was. How much would it cost to repair that building? Probably more. It's a similar story when it comes to historic cityscapes in Quantum of Solace. The chase across the rooftops of Siena leaves plenty of tiles in need of replacement, and culminates in Bond and his quarry crashing through a skylight, swinging about on pulleys and knocking over statues inside some antiquated chamber. </p> <p>If Bond has a problem with architecture it can probably be traced back to his creator, Ian Fleming, who was certainly no fan of modernism. He even went as far as to name one of his best baddies after the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2005/jun/03/film.hayfestival2005\"> Erno Goldfinger</a>, architect of London's Trellick Tower among others. Goldfinger the architect was apparently a neighbour of Fleming's in Hampstead, and the conservation-minded author was incensed when he demolished two Victorian houses to build his now-classic modern villas on <a href=\"http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-2willowroad\">Willow Road</a>. So he returned the insult by lending Goldfinger's name to his fictional gold-loving megalomaniac. Another, less-controversial version of the story has it that Fleming played golf with Goldfinger's wife's cousin, but either way, poor Erno tried and failed to stop Fleming appropriating his name, and had to bear the association for the rest of his life.</p> <p>Fleming's views on Le Corbusier were equally scathing, according to associates. In fact, on closer inspection, what is the archetypal Bond villain if not a modern architect? He is usually on a mission to \"improve\" humanity by wiping out the messy status quo and replacing it with some orderly, rational utopia of his own design. In Moonraker it's Hugo Drax who wants to start civilisation afresh in space. In the Spy Who Loved Me, it's Stromberg, who tries to wipe out the world's cities and create his own underwater world of Atlantis. \"The only hope for the future of mankind,\" he says, echoing Le Corbusier. \"We all have our dreams,\" responds Bond, resolving to ensure Stromberg's scorched-earth vision remains just that - a dream.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-339281535\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/gallery/2008/11/03/elrod1.jpg\" alt=\"James Bond: Elrod House which was featured in Diamonds Are Forever.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The archetypal villain interior ... Elrod House, which was featured in Diamonds Are Forever. Photograph: Alan Weintraub/Arcaid/Corbis</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The association between evil and modernism runs through many Bond movies. In Diamonds Are Forever, Sean Connery is taught a lesson by Bambi and Thumper in John Lautner's beautiful Elrod House in Palm Springs - all futuristic concrete domes, dynamic diagonals and circular furniture. Villain interiors are often modelled on similar modernists. <a href=\"http://www.jamesbondwiki.com/page/Osato's+Office?t=anon\">Osato's spacious office</a> in You Only Live Twice is rather Corbusier in Japan. Goldfinger's \"rumpus room\" is distinctly Frank Lloyd Wright, as is Hugo Drax's behind-the-waterfall lair in Moonraker, whose Mayan-patterned relief panels resemble those of <a href=\"http://www.ennishouse.org/\"> Wright's Ennis House</a>. The association continues in Quantum of Solace. When they find a mole within MI6, where do you think he lives? London's Barbican centre, of course. What kind of house does Bond himself live in, I wonder? Does he even have one?</p> <p>If Bond is the scourge of modern architecture, the movies at least have a champion in the form of Ken Adam, production designer extraordinaire. He was the man behind most of the classic Bond villain headquarters - from Dr No to Moonraker, and he designed and furnished them with great skill and devotion, as a <a href=\"http://www.thamesandhudson.com/en/1/9780500514146.mxs?5fe86a50875617acbcdaad9d1d171810&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\"> new book from Thames and Hudson</a> details. Adam studied architecture in London before the second world war, and he deserves to be considered one. Inarguably, he created some of the most memorable spaces of the modern era. Usually, we look at buildings in a city and wonder what they look like inside. Adam's spectacular interiors do the opposite, inviting us to wonder what the buildings look like on the outside. In reality of course, most of them were just flimsy sets in Pinewood studios whose ultimate fate was to be dismantled or blown up (like the Venetian palazzo in Casino Royale, and the interior of the Paranal Residencia in Quantum of Solace), but Adam's designs have been as influential as any \"real\" pieces of architecture.</p> <p>Bond might deploy his licence to trash with worrying abandon, but his motive should be seen less as a grudge against modern architecture and more an extreme form of criticism. He makes a mockery of buildings' functions and pricks the pomposity of their designers. Flat rooftops become platforms from which to dangle henchmen by their neckties; tall chimneys are there to drop wheelchair-bound villains down; corridors become racetracks, balconies vantage points, buildings as a whole turned into giant climbing frames, their carefully designed details relegated to mere footholds and escape routes. Perhaps that's just fanciful thinking on the part of someone who writes about architecture for a living, but as I loosen my bowtie, unholster my revolver and mix a stiff vodka martini, I can't help but identify with him.</p>",
  "<p>Shareholder groups want Britain's biggest multinational firms to make disclosures to investors about the extent of their involvement in US election campaign financing. </p> <p>Sixteen FTSE 100 firms sponsor employee contribution vehicles, known as political action committees (PACs). Ten of the 16 FTSE 100 firms make no reference - explicit or implicit - to employee donation vehicles in their annual reports. </p> <p>Karina Litvack, head of governance and sustainable investment at F&amp;C Asset Management, said she had repeatedly made it clear F&amp;C was \"uncomfortable\" with corporate political donations and PAC activities. \"Many companies explain to us: 'The game is what it is in the US; you have to pay to be involved.' We recognise it's difficult to go cold turkey, but at the very least companies should disclose their positions clearly to shareholders.\"</p> <p>Corporate PACs receive donations direct from the payroll of eligible US staff - usually senior executives. They are pooled under the control of a PAC board, which selects political candidates to support. The companies are not supposed to say where the cash goes, but candidates well placed or sympathetic to their commercial interests are likely to benefit.</p> <p>Employee donation vehicles connected to British multinationals have been far the most active overseas-sponsored PACs in the past two years. According to the Centre for Responsive Politics, the US electoral transparency campaign group, five of the eight most active foreign-sponsored PACs are connected to FTSE 100 firms.</p> <p>F&amp;C has called on firms to develop and publish a code of conduct outlining the policies for collecting PAC contributions and selecting candidates to back. Specifically, F&amp;C has called for a code to \"detail mechanisms protecting from undue pressure to make contributions\".</p> <p>Donors and recipients are disclosed in filings to the federal election commission, but in practice they are almost impossible to track and aggregate. For example, the Centre for Responsive Politics identifies GlaxoSmithKline as the most active UK-sponsored PAC, calculating it has donated $702,670 (\u00a3442,000) in the current two-year electoral cycle - $409,300 to Republican candidates and $293,370 to Democrats. GSK, one of the few firms to make PAC disclosures in its annual report, has indicated the true figure is much higher. For 2007, GSK PAC gave \u00a3522,172. </p> <p>The 16 FTSE 100 firms that sponsor PACs are GSK, BAE Systems, HSBC, AstraZeneca, Experian, Rolls-Royce, SABMiller, Royal Bank of Scotland, BP, WPP, Diageo, Shell, Prudential, National Grid, Intercontinental Hotels and Rio Tinto.</p>",
  "<p>Jack Straw, the justice secretary, is facing a cabinet-level revolt over his plans for a British bill of rights and responsibilities, and has sent his justice minister, Michael Wills, on a mission to re-explain the proposals to sceptical Whitehall departments.</p> <p>Some cabinet ministers believe there is no demand for such a complex constitutional development and it will be regarded as irrelevant in times of economic stress or, at worst, be highly unpopular.</p> <p>Despite a hostile response from within the cabinet, the green paper on a bill of rights and responsibilities is due to be published before Christmas, justice department sources insisted.</p> <p>Andrew Dismore, the chairman of the all-party joint human rights select committee, said he had been promised the green paper would be published next week. \"If that is not now happening, and there is yet more delay, my committee will have something to say,\" Dismore said.</p> <p>Straw is arguing that it is worth bringing together British rights and duties in one document to build on the existing controversial Human Rights Act, the legislation passed a decade ago which incorporates the European convention on human rights into British law.</p> <p>Straw would also like to introduce the concept of welfare-based or economic rights, especially in the field of education and health. They might also cover areas such as rights to a clean environment.</p> <p>Last week's cabinet discussion was ordered by Gordon Brown, who first set out his support in principle for a British bill of rights and duties in a governance of Britain green paper when he became prime minister in 2007.</p> <p>But Straw faced hostility from ministers led by the home secretary, Jacqui Smith, who are warning a British bill of rights will strengthen the hand of the judiciary over parliament, leading to further public alienation from the concept of human rights.</p> <p>One minister said: \"The opposition to all this came from right across the cabinet. The politics of this has not been thought through.\"</p> <p>Smith is being backed by Home Office lawyers who feel they have a hard enough time trying to protect their decisions from the impact of the Human Rights Act. Straw remains convinced he has the backing of Brown, although Downing Street may be shaken by the cabinet criticism.</p> <p>Straw believes that Britain's unpopular human rights law could be made more palatable if a new bill balanced the existing emphasis on rights with a new emphasis on duties and responsibilities.</p> <p>He has also been told by some ministers that proposals to give citizens new economic rights will be a recipe for confusion, since they are unlikely in the first instance to be enforceable in the UK courts. Many of these proposed economic rights are not contained in the European convention, but have been included in the more recent EU charter of fundamental rights, a charter that is not applicable in British law.</p> <p>It is also being said by some ministers that the Human Rights Act, 10 years old this weekend, is still too new and too unpopular to justify a fresh round of new rights-based legislation.</p>",
  "<p>Born in the early 1990s, the majority of today's students have grown up in an era of economic prosperity, educational opportunities and technological innovation. Something they have yet to encounter is a full-blown economic recession. So how is today's generation shaping up to its first major challenge?</p> <p>For many undergraduates, summer must feel like a long time ago. Not only has the temperature outside grown colder, but the economic climate has dropped a notch or two, sending cold winds chasing through the once sunny uplands of the graduate job market.</p> <p>In July, the Association of Graduate Recruiters, which represents many of the country's leading recruiters, predicted an 11% increase in job vacancies. At the time, this seemed modest: vacancies in 2007 had grown by 16%, and many were expecting similar levels of growth in 2008.</p> <p>Then, in September, came the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Suddenly these figures looked optimistic.</p> <p>The problem is the extent to which the graduate job market is dependent on jobs created by the financial services sector. At the start of this year's recruitment cycle, the top 100 graduate recruiters advertised 19,956 vacancies. Of these, 46% were in jobs related to finance. This has been the pattern for a number of years. Between 2003 and 2008, graduate vacancies in accountancy grew by 80%. Jobs in City investment banks grew by 100%.</p> <p>But as banks are nationalised and confidence in the sector evaporates, the risks of this dependency culture are becoming clear. For the first time since 2003, the number of total vacancies advertised by the top 100 recruiters is lower than recorded in the previous year. Even vacancies in accountancy are down by 3%.</p> <p>But not all employers in the financial services sector are having a hard time - at least not yet. In some sectors, recruitment targets are broadly in line with those of 2007. PricewaterhouseCoopers, the UK's biggest graduate recruiter, still plans to recruit 1,200 graduates this year; Deloitte, 1,000; KPMG, 1,000; and Ernst &amp; Young, 750.</p> <p>Some high-street banks are also boldly pressing ahead with their graduate intake. This may be because they have learned from previous recessions that pulling out of one year's graduate recruitment can have longer-term repercussions, particularly when the economy picks up.</p> <p>Richard Freeborn, recruitment manager at HSBC, says: \"We always look at our graduate recruitment numbers from the point of view of our needs for future senior managers, six or eight years down the line.\"</p> <p>Freeborn recognises that graduate recruitment is both time-consuming and expensive, but is adamant that graduates are central to his organisation's future strategy. \"It's really dangerous, although for some organisations very tempting, to undertake a kneejerk reaction and reduce their numbers,\" he says. \"It will cause problems in their talent strategy later on.\"</p> <p>So if employers are determined to see through the credit crunch, how are students responding?</p> <p>\"Recession\" is not a word familiar to many students, apart from those studying economics. This may be about to change. Research by student representative officers at the University of Liverpool's guild of students found that around a quarter of those polled were concerned that the downturn might have a negative impact on the value of their qualifications, and 16% said the current economic conditions made them more likely to consider a postgraduate course.</p> <p>Such attitudes were, however, in the minority. Most of those questioned were confident that the credit crunch would have no impact on the long-term value of their qualifications. Bullishly, 17% believed the downturn would enhance the value of their qualification.</p> <p>But this could be wishful thinking. Among careers officers, there is concern that too few students have grasped the implications of a recession.</p> <p>\"I see some evidence of naivety among students,\" says Nick Keely, director of the careers service at the University of Newcastle. \"Some are still fully expecting to secure roles in investment banks or in property. Some don't really seem to have cottoned on to the fact that the crunch is affecting some sectors very hard.\" Keely believes that students need to be aware that in a downturn, employers expect more from applicants. </p> <p>\"I can only suggest that this is likely to be a marketplace for students who not only demonstrate all of the normal employer expectations of graduate skills and achievement, but who also demonstrate lots of personal enterprise and a real sense of adaptability in their career planning and direction. This is not a time for rigid thinking.\"</p> <p>There are signs that growing numbers of students are heeding this advice. Attendance at campus careers fairs is noticeably higher than in previous years. Earlier this month, twice as many students attended the Liverpool graduate careers festival as in 2007, and a part-time job fair attracted 700 students in its first two hours.</p> <p>But what else can students do to counteract the effects of the credit crunch?</p> <p>\"Higher education will continue to open doors for graduates, but with the economic downturn, there will be an even greater focus on those who attend university, as the market concentrates on graduates to become its future leaders,\" stresses Danielle Grufferty, president of Liverpool's guild of students.</p> <p>She acknowledges, however, that as competition for jobs increases, employability skills and extracurricular activities will become more important than ever. \"Employers will be looking for confident, motivated and well-rounded graduates in what is already a competitive marketplace,\" she says. \"University presents an opportunity to develop, but now more than ever, this development should not be limited to academic ability.\"</p> <p>Prior to the fall of Lehman Brothers, competition for graduate jobs was approximately 50 applicants for every job vacancy. This autumn, the ratio will increase. Faced with a volatile economy, final-year students will need more than just a good degree result to stand a chance in a credit-crunched marketplace.</p> <p>\u2022 Dr Paul Redmond is head of the careers and employability service at the University of Liverpool</p> <h2> Raise your game</h2> <p><strong>Apply early</strong> Deadlines for jobs with 2009 start dates are very early this year. Even if a company doesn't specify a closing date, make sure your application reaches them in the next few weeks. That way you can be sure that you give yourself a chance of making it to the first cut.</p> <p><strong>Focus on quality not quantity</strong> Recruiters are taking on fewer graduates in 2009, so their expectations will be higher. Expect online applications to face increased levels of scrutiny. Spelling mistakes, poor grammar and lack of punctuation will incur automatic rejection. Avoid the scattergun approach and concentrate on a few high-quality applications to well-chosen, appropriate vacancies.</p> <p><strong>Get involved</strong> Nothing separates winners from losers as much as relevant, marketable experience. Universities offer countless opportunities for developing skills: clubs, societies, teams and extracurricular activities. There are also lots of opportunities for boosting your CV by volunteering.</p> <p><strong>Get out more</strong> In today's job market, contacts and access to networks are essential. University offers lots of opportunities for meeting with employers and finding out what they are really looking for. Find out what's happening at your university this autumn.</p> <p><strong>Use your careers service</strong> All students - particularly those preparing to enter the job market in 2009 - should be regular visitors to their careers services. Whether you need to arrange work experience, explore vacancies, talk to an adviser, review your options or have an expert check over your application, the careers service should always be your first point of contact.</p>",
  "<p>Roy Jones Jr has gone down into the darkness so many times that he carries the look of a man about to return to his most familiar place on earth. He might never have really loved the murky risk and raw violence but, having won over a hundred million dollars between the ropes and also been knocked cold and senseless, Jones approaches his fight against Joe Calzaghe at Madison Square Garden on Saturday night with a profound understanding of boxing. The once brilliant but now faded virtuoso of the ring knows how much this savage old business retains its capacity to reward or maim in equal measure.</p> <p>\"I'm a realist,\" the 39-year-old drawls with a sly little twitch of his lips which is too cool to be called a smile, \"and so I really don't know what is going to happen between me and Joe. I don't know what tomorrow holds. None of us do. We got to wait and see what God has planned.\"</p> <p>Jones has always boasted of his religious serenity before fights; and it is a claim he now bolsters further by stressing the significance of Calzaghe and him seizing promotional control of their lucrative contest. \"That's the beautiful thing about this fight,\" he exclaims. \"Joe is the first fighter I'm facing that don't have a promoter. He got rid of Frank Warren and so this is the first time two super fighters have got together and put on an event this special with not a single promoter in sight. There ain't no Warren here, no Don King, no Bob Arum, none of them guys. That's a huge victory for both me and Joe. </p> <p>\"So I don't know what will be the bigger accomplishment - me winning and handing Joe his first loss or the fact that we changed boxing history by promoting it ourselves. Which is the bigger story? And what might God have planned for me? Do I get one or two victories? I just know me and Joe already got one big win each by making this fight.\"</p> <p>As a further example of the way in which boxers have tried to take charge of their careers, following the lead of Oscar De La Hoya, who is America's most famous current fighter and the head of its new promotional powerhouse, the Jones-Calzaghe extravaganza provides another intriguing landmark.</p> <p>\"Joe is a whole lot easier to deal with than Don King,\" Jones chuckles. \"From the start we said we split it down the middle, 50-50. He gets his half, I get mine. Never had to play hardball with Joe. We just started texting each other, saying let's make this fight. We made sure we put together a real good fight and a real good situation for both of us.</p> <p>\"That's why there's no reason to talk bad or start swearing at each other. Why be hateful to a guy you're going to make more money with than anyone else in your career? Of course you want to beat him but I don't want to say I hate Joe's sons - and I sure don't want my sons to hate Joe. Why should they? Joe's a great fighter and a pretty good guy.\"</p> <p>Yet beyond the shift in promotional power the grim old dangers of boxing remain. Calzaghe, a grizzled veteran himself at 36 and still undefeated after 45 bouts, is too smart to be seduced by Jones's friendly fa\u00e7ade. </p> <p>He has already suggested that, for all the warm words, Jones will \"want to rip my face off\" in the ring. Calzaghe, in turn, promises another troubling night for a fighter who once legitimately called himself the best in the world - especially in March 2003 when Jones completed his dizzying rise from being an outrageously skilled middleweight to becoming the WBA world heavyweight champion by outclassing a far bigger man in John Ruiz.</p> <p>\"I know it's going to be tough,\" Jones concedes. \"Joe's got 32 KOs so I know what he can do. Don't worry - I'm no fool.\"</p> <p>Anyone who saw Jones being knocked out by Antonio Tarver, or left stretched on the canvas for a distressing five minutes after taking a withering punch from Glen Johnson, will not need any prompting to feel some concern for an ageing fighter. He might have suffered only four defeats in 56 fights but memories of those two shocking nights, coming within a few months of each other in 2004, cannot be easily shaken.</p> <p>\"I know why you keep talking about those two defeats but I'd just come through all the devastation of moving back down from heavyweight, of losing all that weight. And one-punch knock-outs can happen to anyone. Tarver got lucky. He never beat me up or nothing.\"</p> <p>And yet Johnson, a hardened pro rather than a boxing genius, doled out a painful beating for nine rounds - before smashing Jones into unconsciousness. \"I was done,\" Jones grunts. \"The doctor afterwards said I was so dehydrated. I had taken so much out of my body to make the weight I had nothing left. But the interesting thing about that fight is that I have an aunt in Pensacola [the Florida town where Jones has lived all his life] and I talk to her more than most people. I told her before that fight that I wouldn't be surprised if I got knocked out. I never felt that before or since. But God sometimes brings turmoil down on you to test your faith. I felt that happening then.\"</p> <p>Jones has won his last three fights, the most recent being an easy victory early this year over the hopelessly outgunned Felix Trinidad - who used to be an outstanding welterweight in the late 1990s. That lopsided win meant little, as even Jones admits. \"I loved it but Trinidad wasn't even a legitimate middleweight - so how could he face Roy at light-heavy? C'mon!\" </p> <p>Logic suggests that Calzaghe should win comfortably but a more insidious feeling persists that Jones could yet dredge up some of his old ferocious dazzle. He still carries a hard edge, despite his effusive praise for Calzaghe, which harks back to the trauma of his childhood.</p> <p>Jones once showed me the patch of ground in Pensacola where his father, Roy Sr, who trained him throughout his early career, \"used to whup me with a plastic pipe or a water-hose, sometimes a belt, to make me fight back, always asking, 'Well, boy, you a kingpin or a participant?' I always said the same, 'Kingpin...' \" </p> <p>At least he and his father, after their infamous break-up when Big Roy shot Little Roy's pit-bull more than 15 years ago, are speaking again. \"I had to leave my dad then. Once God said 'Go', I headed for the woods but that's a long time ago. Things are cool now.\"</p> <p>And what about those notorious training sessions his father made him endure as a young boy? \"I thank him for it,\" Jones says, \"because that made me the person I am. I wouldn't want to go through it again but it made me strong. My dad sacrificed his relationship with me so I'd be stronger for it. But I could never do it to my kids - I like to have a happy relationship with them. If I could I have a relationship with my dad like Joe has with Enzo [Calzaghe] it would be great - but me and my dad don't work that way. And we never will.\"</p> <p>Jones looks at me with an unblinking gaze that transcends regret. And suddenly it becomes possible to believe some of that past darkness might yet drive him on to one last supreme effort against Calzaghe. It also makes it seem ludicrous that his shaven-headed, bull-necked manager should then threaten me after Jones and I have discussed his more pained reaction to the fact that cock-fighting has now been banned in neighbouring Louisiana. </p> <p>\"They've made it a felon to drive from Florida to Louisiana with any fighting birds,\" Jones sighs, \"so I've had to get rid of most of my chickens. I only got about a hundred left now, which I just keep for colour and breeding. I love those birds as much as anything. I don't fight them no more but people don't understand fighting is in the nature of those chickens. I think it's ridiculous but I have to move on.\"</p> <p>Jones is a law-abiding citizen who has abandoned cock-fighting for good - but two of his management team come down hard on me after our interview has ended. All kinds of trials and tribulations are promised should I even mention that Jones and I had discussed his enduring love of watching one rooster do battle with another. It is mildly bemusing for Jones has argued throughout his career that he has learnt more about boxing by studying his strutting birds than watching grainy footage of any great pugilist from the past. Jones himself is blissfully oblivious to the heavy-handed exchange and he continues talking about his beloved chickens in an adjoining room. </p> <p>He does not sound much like a man in need of protection; for a cold and dark fighting heart still beats inside him. And so, against all odds, Jones looks set to give Calzaghe a long and brutally searching night at the grand but bloody Garden. <br><em><br>Joe Calzaghe v Roy Jones Jr is exclusively live on Setanta Sports 1.

  "<p>It was already going to be an exciting week for black communities across the world, but when a team of West Indian cricketers won the Stanford cricket match, and then, 10 seconds before the finish line, Lewis Hamilton made his move on Timo Glock, Dotun Adebayo, presenting his BBC London radio show, couldn't help himself. Would this be, he asked, \"the beginning of the greatest week ever in black history\"?</p> <p>The issue of role models is, of course, a perennial debate within and outside the black community - who are they? And where are they, when they are so urgently needed? Will this week prove a kind of tipping point? Simon Woolley, director and co-founder of Operation Black Vote, who was a guest on Adebayo's show, sincerely hopes so - and believes he has reason to. For one thing, he is emotionally exhausted by the drama of Hamilton's win - because, \"it's like watching your child race, such an emotional rollercoaster - that's the emotional investment we've got\". For him, and everybody else who recognised themselves in the young mixed-race man from Stevenage, the win was particularly piquant because, \"it's about winning against adversity. Yes, because he's a young black man we're proud. But we've watched him face the most wretched racist abuse. Our journey to sucess is always peppered by obstacles of racism. So when we do succeed, particularly with great dignity ... \"</p> <p>For another, he has been seeing the effect of Obama's candidacy, from day to day, and is bowled over by it. A couple of weeks ago, he ran an event in Brixton, called Equanomics, a project that looks at political and economic empowerment for black communities. \"We would have been happy if 50 showed up - but we got 300, many under 25. Look, we've got a black man who could be the most powerful person in the world. He's speaking our language, he looks like us - our organisation is riding the crest of an Obama wave. It's the dawn of a new era.\" </p> <p>For nine months, Operation Black Vote has been running a political mentoring scheme they have been calling the Barack Obama Generation, in which established politicians, mostly in the Welsh Assembly, have agreed to mentor young political hopefuls from minorities. Nine people stepped up, and three - all political novices - are already in positions where they might be elected: Mari Rees has been selected as a Labour candidate for the winnable seat of Pembrokeshire (if she won, she would be the first black politician to be elected in Wales); Elizabeth Musa has been nominated to stand for election to the Welsh Assembly in four years' time; and Shazia Awan has been shortlisted for a Tory seat.</p> <p>But the effect need not be this direct. \"The thing about Lewis Hamilton, and to a big extent Barack Obama,\" says Diane Abbott, MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington, \"is that they are running counter to stereotype. They're not sportsmen - obviously formula one motor racing is a sport, but it's not a physical sport. There's this idea that black men have physical prowess, which is not, in itself, unremarkable. Where it's about how fast you can run and how strong you are, you will get black champions. What is interesting about Hamilton, and to a lesser extent Tiger Woods, is that we're talking now about very cerebral sports.\" </p> <p>She has also been interested to see, in the US media, mentions of African-American men \"generally carrying themselves with more pride. Because you've got this black man who could become president, and in any event has been centre-stage in this campaign. I think it does have an effect - we're in a society, both in America and Britain, where black men are demonised and vilified. I mean most weeks you can pick up a newspaper and unless they're a sportsman it means they've killed someone or they're mad. So it's a very good thing to see a positive image of a black man. And more important, in a way, with Barack Obama, a black family. For Americans, the </p> <p>First family is a bit like the royal family for us. So with Barack we're going to have a black family that's a symbol of nationhood, and I think that's quite profound.\"</p> <p>Woolley agrees with this, too. \"On a very basic level, on a daily basis, we see ourselves portrayed in the media as villains. But we can look at this dynamic young black kid, and think, with a bit of luck my child could follow in his success.\" Woolley's partner is Spanish, so they have mixed-race children, and looking at Hamilton and Obama, \"we can say to our children - they look like you. Unless you've got a black child or a mixed-race child the profundity of having such role models would be difficult to grasp.\" </p> <p>Which is all true, but others caution that their achievements are so huge, and so specific and arcane, that the effect, while galvanising in a general sort of way, may not trickle down to, say, a teenager struggling with her GCSEs in Leeds. As Michael Eboda, who for years was editor of the New Nation newspaper, and is now CEO of Powerful Media, which has just published a list of Britain's 100 most influential black people, points out, \"You have to have a particular set of circumstances to do what Hamilton has done: you have to be quite small, be able to raise a lot of money, and be ultra-talented - most kids know that's not what they're going to be.\" </p> <p>He argues that if what Lewis and Obama have done inspires other people, that's brilliant, \"but we shouldn't lose sight of the fact that there are lots of other people who are a lot more accessible.\" He often takes the list into schools, and shows it to young black men, in particular. </p> <p>Stereotypes come in all shapes and sizes, and so people assume, for example, the black \"youth\" would be particularly interested in footballers or rappers. But there are only two sportsmen on it. \"They're far, far, far more impressed by a guy like Michael Prest, one of our panellists, whose business turns over a billion a year. They find that far more impressive. It's what they really want to do - a lot of them are interested in music and stuff but a hell of lot of them say they want to be a CEO, or run a company. Or they say they want to be a lawyer, a doctor. You meet the odd one who wants to be a footballer. But they know that either you're good at it or you're not.\" They're interested in Tidjane Thiam, the group finance director for Prudential, who's being groomed to be CEO; they're interested in the most influential person on the list, Dr Mo Ibrahim, who started off working at BT, set up his own company, sold it for for $3.4bn, and now runs a foundation dedicated to promoting good governance in Africa - these they see as possible paths. As for Obama in particular, \"I think we kind of have to look at ourselves and say what are we doing over here? There are a lot of people in very powerful positions here, and they're the ones we in Britain have to look to. I'm not a great fan always looking at America.\" </p> <p>And in the end, the ideal, the hope, is that something more complex and much greater can be achieved; that what the British actor and playwright Kwame Kwei-Armah calls \"a new narrative\" can begin. \"In the past I have been reluctant to accept the mantle of role model but whether you accept it or not, you are,\" says Patricia Scotland, Baroness Scotland of Asthal and now attorney general for England and Wales. In 1991, she became the youngest person to take silk since William Pitt the Younger, and the first black woman to be made a QC. She says she was particularly moved during that year by a father who told her that his nine-year-old daughter had clipped a picture of her out of a newspaper and announced: \"I'm going to do that.\" She now has a degree in law and has been called to the bar. She doesn't tell me what colour this nine-year-old was because, for her, that is not the only point. </p> <p>Of course there is a long way to go, and the website that received a barrage of racist taunts about Hamilton is yet another example. \"But,\" says Baroness Scotland, \"I would say to all young people, not just black young people, 'You can achieve!' Irrespective of your background, your ethnicity, you faith, or your sexual orientation. I think it's a good time for people and not just black people. It's very important for all our children of whatever colour and whatever faith to try and see individuals as that - as individuals who have huge potential to achieve. And I would love us to finally get to the stage when each of our children will look at their own talents as being the final arbiter of what they will do, and not an outward manifestation, or a sexual or other orientation. So they won't say I can't do this, because I am white, or black, or Jewish or Christian or Muslim, or I'm gay or I am straight. That they are able just to say, I am a person of talent. We need to create an environment where that talent is released.\" And to that we can only say amen.</p> <h2>'If Obama gets in, I'm moving to America'</h2> <p><strong>Young black British men on the role models that give them hope</strong></p> <p><strong>Anthony Lawrence, 20, student</strong></p> <p>To know that there might be a black president and to see Hamilton winning makes me feel happy inside, man, because I'm black. There aren't enough role models for the younger generation. Me, I never had a father, and my mum died when I was young. I never had anyone except for my grandma. I wouldn't listen to her, I was always on the street doing what I wanted to do. As soon as Barack Obama came on the scene, I listened to everything he says. He speaks to me, he makes me think that there is another way out of this wartorn world. One of my friends died the other day. He got stabbed. He was 16. I cried, man. It made me feel like I'm the next one to go. </p> <p><strong>Peter Okeowo, 22, student</strong></p> <p>I was watching the race, and I thought Lewis was going to lose - when he won I was really relieved. I felt so proud. He did well despite criticism and I was really happy for him. Now </p> <p>I want Obama to win. I was discussing with my friends whether one day in this country will we have a black prime minister. Most people were saying never. But hopefully it will happen. </p> <p><strong>Moboshir Ali, 19, currently looking for work</strong></p> <p>Lewis Hamilton? Brilliant. Brilliant. Brilliant. Now he's in the history books. It was so good. I don't care about Obama, though. I give up on politics. I really don't think it will change my life. Politicians don't represent me. I can't do grand-prix racing because I'm no good at driving, but maybe I will get into IT.</p> <p><strong>Joshua Ellison, 17, student</strong></p> <p>Hackney is my hometown, it's easy to blend in - but if Obama gets in, I'm moving to America, bwoy! I'm excited about Lewis Hamilton, too, and really happy for him. If there are black people achieving, it's there in the history books and will live on and on.</p> <p>I want to move to America where there are more opportunities. We all talk about it in class. Some of the kids I know, all they talk about is guns, and if they have someone to look up to, it gives them another option. </p> <p><strong>Duane Mayers, 20, chef</strong></p> <p>It would be great to have a black president. He's grown up the way we've grown up. I've heard about his background and family. He's had that childhood and knows how we live so he will know how to change that. Lewis Hamilton is all right but not such a role model as Obama. </p> <p><strong>Kenny Julian, 18, student</strong></p> <p>I'm not a politics person but it's good to give black people a shot at being president. Give them a chance to prove themselves. </p> <p><strong>Sile Entee, 21, student</strong></p> <p>It's hopeful, but if he turns president, they're going to assassinate him. America's going to have a civil war.</p> <p><strong>Michael Morris, 24, student</strong></p> <p>I rate Barack Obama. He's stronger than the other people. Lewis Hamilton? I rate him too. I'm Jamaican and English, mixed-race. I'm proud to have those mixed-race role models.</p> <p><strong>Rennal Edwards, 15, school student</strong></p> <p>Lewis and Obama, although they're doing different jobs, they're linked. They must both have struggled to be where they are. They've shown it is possible - that dreams do come true.</p> <p>Obama's already shown how we've got a much more modern society, a multicultural society that allows everyone to have an opportunity to be in power, not just one race. And to rule America - that's pretty significant. It means a lot to the world, and to me. The States tends to be followed by the rest of the world. They've let people come into America from all backgrounds and show that they can do well, not just in politics but in all sorts of things, in everything.</p> <p>Lewis Hamilton, now - he's come from not such a high-status background, which makes him a really good role model for people such as myself. I'm going through the experiences he went though when he was a kid. Their success will cut down a lot on racism in the world. Obama, especially, has shown us the way to a better place.</p> <p><strong>Arron Thompson, 16, school student</strong></p> <p>Great to see Lewis Hamilton in the headlines. It'll be a shame if Obama doesn't get there - he's gone so far. His mum's white, maybe that helps. Maybe it helps stop white people getting jealous.</p> <p><strong>Julius Soares, 19, engineering student</strong></p> <p>A black man being president! It makes me feel that in the future I can be whatever I want to be. He's inspired me, definitely. Obama really will make a difference if he becomes president. The fact that his mum's white makes no difference. He's black and he says he's black and that's how it is. Lewis Hamilton too, he also shows that if you just believe, you can achieve whatever you want to achieve. He said that he believed, and that was what counts.<br><strong>Interviews by Anita Sethi and Martin Wainwright</strong></p> <p>\u2022 The inside track: Gemma Briggs speaks to the people behind Lewis Hamilton's success <a href=\"http://theguardian.com/sport\">theguardian.com/sport</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Thursday November 6 2008.

  "<p>Racist, homophobic and physical bullying are not considered harmless fun or accepted in schools. We recognise these forms of bullying and rightly view them as abhorrent. But sexual or sexist bullying is equally ubiquitous - so why is calling a girl or woman a slag or a ho not afforded the same gravity?</p> <p>One problem is that, as with all things sexual, the boundaries are blurred. A mass of hormonal adolescents getting to grips with their sexual identities is bound to bring up misunderstandings about appropriate behaviour and wanted or unwanted attention. Sexual bullying is different from other forms of bullying because it is seen as \"ordinary, expected and public\", as Nan Stein, a leading US expert, points out in her book Classrooms and Courtrooms: Facing Sexual Harassment in K-12 Schools.</p> <p>Name-calling is so common it's hardly noticed. Girls can be slags, slappers, sluts, bitches, whores and hos for what they wear, for flirting, cheating or experimenting with their sexuality. The age-old double standard remains. \"Girls get called slag and tart because they flirt with guys and they wear revealing clothes,\" says Jess, 15. \"This is to hurt their feelings, or maybe because they are jealous. But they really are a slag if they sleep around.\"</p> <p>I ask a teacher I know about incidents of sexual bullying at her secondary school. She lists a boy aggressively telling a girl he wants to finger her, a boy pulling down a girl's skirt in front of other students, boys flicking girls' skirts up, making fun of their weight and clothes, and calling them slags and whores. Damian Carnell, of Nottinghamshire Domestic Violence Forum (NDVF), says: \"One incident in a school we work in involved a boy who grabbed hold of a girl in the school corridor and gave her a love bite. Female youth workers talk about situations in which boys play chatline messages to them from their mobile phones, point porn images at them from their phones or draw porn images on paper that they've just been looking at on the computer, even in the school library. So this is sexual bullying or harassment of staff as well as pupils.\"<br><strong><br>Revealing figures</strong></p> <p>Finn Mackay is an anti-bullying coordinator in north London, where she manages the Home Safe: Domestic Violence Prevention Project for Schools. \"Like most forms of bullying, sexual bullying is based on unequal power relations,\" she says. \"In the borough I work in, we have zero tolerance of sexual bullying, precisely because if it goes unchallenged, it sends a message that sexual violence is to be expected in life and society.\"</p> <p>This continuum from sexual bullying to violence against women is keenly recognised by Tender, an educational charity that works with 13- to 18-year-olds in 85 secondary schools and pupil referral units in greater London. Its project, Trust, uses creative arts to challenge tolerance of violence. \"Although young people initially agreed male violence towards women is wrong,\" says artistic director Tamsin Larby, \"scratching under the surface revealed both sexes felt that physical or sexual violence is acceptable in certain situations.\" Tender conducted a survey with 288 young Londoners about their attitudes towards domestic and sexual violence. Twenty-nine per cent of male and female students felt it was sometimes OK for a man to hit a woman if she'd slept with someone else; 80% thought that girls and women sometimes encourage violence and abuse by the way they dress, and 76% thought a woman encourages violence by not treating men with respect.</p> <p>On questionnaires asking students why they think a girl might be responsible for violence, one boy wrote: \"If a woman is unfaithful, but not a proper beating, just a slap.\" Girls, worryingly, often blame themselves. This comment - \"Sometimes they can provoke the person or give them false hope. Because some girls dress like sluts and they act all flirty, so then obviously boys will rape them or whatever\" - was from a girl.</p> <p>While the furore over the behaviour of broadcasters Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross continues, another BBC DJ, Radio 1's Chris Moyles, continues to be rewarded for sharing his worldview of women with the nation's youth. Moyles has called a female news presenter a \"slut\", Victoria Beckham \"a whore\" and some female listeners \"dirty whores\". In newspaper interviews he has commented: \"Which woman is going to argue that Jodie Marsh isn't a fucking slapper?\" and \"I do hate it when a bitch lets herself slide.\" Girls Aloud's Nicola Roberts accused Moyles of bullying her after he constantly criticised her on air (he said, among other comments, she had \"a face like a slapped arse\").</p> <p>Carnell says: \"It's not surprising that sexual bullying exists and may be getting worse. Music videos present individual men possessing a group of sexualised young women; gadgets and entertainment for boys and young men demand that the player objectify, sexually attack and kill women. So-called heroes that many boys and young men look up to, especially in sport, sexually abuse young women, get away with it and keep their celebrity status. Sexual humiliation is seen as hilarious in pro-wrestling and by DJs.\"</p> <p>Set against this cultural backdrop are the hard facts on adolescent male sexual violence. In the UK, girls under 16 made up 31% of reported rape victims in 2004-05; in London, almost half of all reported rapes come from under-18s. An ICM survey commissioned by the End Violence Against Women campaign found that 42% of young people know girls whose boyfriends have hit them, and 40% know girls whose boyfriends have coerced or pressurised them to have sex. And that's just the statistics we hear about. The NSPCC and police say that 95% of crimes committed against children are not reported.</p> <p>Unchallenged, sexual bullying, whether bum pinching or coercion in teen relationships, sets up patterns of behaviour in which control is accepted. Clearly, there is a need for open discussion about attraction, objectification and abuse. \"When running healthy relationships workshops for boys from the age of 12 and young men, they often make jokes about and humourise rape and other sexual violence against women and girls, think it's OK to do so, and back up their behaviour,\" says Carnell. \"These workshops are very much the first time their attitudes, ignorance and behaviour get challenged.\"</p> <p><strong>Challenging stereotypes</strong></p> <p>The charity Womankind Worldwide works with schools and local authorities, giving them resources to develop a \"stop sexual bullying campaign\". Its programme, Challenging Violence, Changing Lives, has been piloted in secondary schools as part of personal, social and health education (PSHE) and citizenship classes.</p> <p>\"It helps pupils understand how gender stereotypes limit their lives and relationships, how socialisation processes reinforced by media and popular culture raise us to believe that violence and aggression are acceptable,\" explains the organisation's UK education programme manager, Hannah White. \"Time and again in schools, we hear that it is so normalised it is ignored.\"</p> <p>With the help of young people, Womankind has drafted a code of practice to define sexual bullying. \"We'd like to see schools adopting this code and an anti-sexual bullying policy agreed by students and staff, addressing sexual bullying through work in lessons and assemblies, including looking at the way men, women and sexuality are presented in the school, in the press, on television and in computer games,\" says White.</p> <p>While anti-bullying work is being carried out across the country, not all definitions of bullying used by schools include sexual bullying. \"Gender\" was only recently included in the part of the PSHE curriculum at key stage 3 and 4 that deals with diversity and prejudice. While the government has announced plans to make PSHE classes - which include sex and relationships education - compulsory, campaigners argue that positive relationships education should also include gender violence prevention and combat harmful gender stereotypes.</p> <p>\"PSHE should be a compulsory part of the curriculum, because it is within this subject that great work is being done to challenge stereotypes and to encourage equality, respect and safe relationships for all,\" says Mackay. \"A lot of good work is being done to challenge gender stereotypes, in part of normal PSHE and citizenship. And there is work on consent issues and safe relationships being done in some sex and relationships education.\"</p> <p>More work is clearly needed. \"Did you hear about the case of three 14-year-old boys who gang raped an 11-year-old girl, filmed the rapes on a mobile phone and sent it round the whole school?\" asks White. \"This is terrifying. The normalisation of girls being called a slut or being subjected to abuse and not taking it seriously has to be challenged.\" </p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.tender.org.uk/trust\">www.tender.org.uk/trust</a></p>",
  "<p>Today's election is poised to end the Republican era in American politics - an era that began in reaction to Lyndon Johnson's Great Society, the Vietnam war and the civil rights revolution, was pioneered by Richard Nixon, consolidated by Ronald Reagan, and wrecked by George W Bush.</p> <p>Almost every aspect of the Republican ascendancy has been discredited and lies in tatters - its policies, politics, and even its version of patriotism - down to the rock-bottom notion that progressive taxation itself, initiated by a Republican president, Theodore Roosevelt, who John McCain hails as his personal icon, is unpatriotic.</p> <p>McCain's own chronic helplessness in establishing rapport, prompting him to latch on to mediums from Sarah Palin to Joe the Plumber, is aggravated by his party's decay. He is an ironic character to make the last stand on behalf of a party he has been at odds with for virtually his whole career. </p> <p>McCain is less a victim of age than of the age - the end of the age of Reagan. Realignments in American party politics are the consequence of catastrophe. The coming of the civil war produced the Republican party that more or less ruled until the Great Depression brought about the New Deal. The modern Republican era began with the fragmentation of the liberal Democratic consensus in 1968 over Vietnam, civil rights and urban mayhem. Southerners and the urban ethnic working and middle classes shifted allegiance, forging a coalition that delivered 49 states first to Nixon in 1972 and then to Reagan in 1984.</p> <p>The strange death of Republican America has been a long time in the making. As early as 1988, the Reagan coalition threatened to unravel. Only when the Republican candidate, George HW Bush, resorted to a vicious campaign - conjuring the pledge of allegiance to the flag and an African-American rapist named Willie Horton, against a worthy and weak Democratic candidate, Michael Dukakis - was the hold on power preserved.</p> <p>In 1992, Bill Clinton won back the white working class and parts of the South, but Republicans fiercely resisted his efforts to restore the authority of progressive government. They shut down the federal government twice and impeached him in the struggle for power. Then in 2000, when his vice-president, Al Gore, ran to succeed him, the conservative majority of the supreme court, by a five to four decision, ordered that votes in Florida not be counted and handed the presidency to George W Bush.</p> <p>Bush was surrounded by the aura of illegitimacy until September 11 granted him what the election had not. But even before this, he acted as if he had won office with a commanding mandate, radicalising the unfulfilled agendas of Nixon and Reagan. Two figures whose origins lay in the Nixon operation, his vice-president Dick Cheney and chief political strategist Karl Rove, provided the grand designs for an imperial presidency and a permanent Republican majority. Just as Reagan was a more radical version of Nixon, Bush was a radicalisation of Reagan. After nearly two terms, his experiment has resulted in worldwide disaster.</p> <p>McCain, Bush's bitter rival in 2000, won the Republican nomination only because conservatives were too fractured to unify behind a single candidate. Bush had shattered them and his influence in choosing a successor was nil. McCain's choice of Governor Sarah Palin of Alaska as his running mate was a symptom of his simultaneous disdain for his party and his need to patch over its divisions. </p> <p>Despite Bush's unprecedented unpopularity and the general disgrace of the Republicans, two weeks after the Republican convention McCain led in the polls and the key swing states. He appeared to be defying political gravity. Obama, still an uncertainty, was sliding. His advisers held panicked emergency meetings.</p> <p>Then came the crushing blow of the economic crisis. The sub-prime mortgage problem and widespread housing foreclosures was already an issue in the early spring. But few predicted the collapse of great financial houses just eight weeks before voters were due to go to the polls. Never before in US history had such a sudden and profound shock to the system struck so close to an election.</p> <p>The crisis brought out the greatest vulnerabilities of the Republicans. Even former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan testified that he had been blinkered by ideology. With Reaganite conservatism dishonoured, McCain was cornered into half-denying his beliefs.</p> <p>During the congressional debate over the bail-out of the banks, Obama adopted a posture of dignified caution. McCain, however, threw himself into the maelstrom without any plan. The rightwing members of the House of Representatives, contemptuous of McCain and tired of making excuses for the Bush White House, voted it down - demolishing McCain's claim to experience, stability and effectiveness. The bail-out was eventually passed, but he did not recover.</p> <p>McCain desperately elevated Joe the Plumber as the voice of the people against Obama's \"socialism\". Joe was a ghost of Republican campaigns past, the stalwart member of Nixon's \"silent majority\", the \"Reagan Democrat\". But the symbol was an atavism; the reality was a guy on the make seeking to own a business and avoid taxes. Once the spotlight focused on him, he hired an agent to hustle commercial endorsements and a book deal. Just as McCain's campaign has been an extended seance trying to call forth Reagan, he found himself at a rally summoning Joe the Plumber, who wasn't there. \"You're all Joe the Plumber!\" yelled McCain in frustration.</p> <p>McCain long despised Bush, then embraced him and, by the campaign's end, condemned him. One thing he has not done is to reflect on his own incoherence and whether it represents more than the vicissitudes of ambition. Bush, too, envisioned himself as Reagan's true son. In his campaign McCain has acted as though he had only to repeat magical phrases and symbols that lifted Republicans into the White House to restore the natural order.</p> <p>Now, certain factors that have dominated US politics for 40 years seem destined to recede to the far corners. In economics, supply-side panaceas and deregulation created the worst crisis since the Great Depression, requiring a conservative Republican administration to part-nationalise banks, something unimaginable under any Democratic administration. In foreign policy, neoconservatism led to the morass in Iraq and Afghanistan while undermining the western alliance. In social policy, the evangelical right battered science, the separation of church and state, and the right to privacy. Finally, the conservative principle of limited government has become a watchword for incompetence, cronyism, corruption, hypocrisy, and contempt for the rule of law.</p> <p>Obama may still be a largely unknown quantity, but the judgment will be made about the known.

  "<p>I may have picked the wrong game to watch Ross McCormack as he missed a penalty and also had three good chances, none of which he managed to get on target, much less score. On the plus side he is the Championship's top scorer and I absolutely refuse to believe that he won't be one of the finds of the season even though he did his best to convince me otherwise. Although he clearly wasn't at his best, I saw enough to make such a bold statement.</p> <p>He has the fortunate knack of being in the right place at the right time and he kept hunting out opportunities. But he is not a player who works only in the penalty box, as I saw a willing runner from balls played deep into the channels and someone who is happy to provide an option for team-mates to bounce the ball off in and around the 18-yard area.</p> <p>His hold-up and link play were good, although his eagerness on occasion to turn and face his marker meant he needed to settle a little more when initially receiving the ball so he was set and the ball was under control.</p> <p>He was, for the main part, the one who came short for the ball but never switched off when he had been bypassed in a move. He also got himself into good positions whenever the ball had been worked wide.</p> <p>The big-man-little-man partnership he has with Jay Bothroyd forces him to work the near post. But when, for once, Bothroyd couldn't get round the back, McCormack quickly spotted this and intelligently engineered a chance at the far post.</p> <p>His authority in the team is already established despite his youth and he took most of the free-kicks. One thing that really stood out, and something I particularly like and look for in centre-forwards, was his excellent judgment when weighing up his options when his winger got the ball wide. </p> <p>This was highlighted on one occasion when his wide man was closed down and could not get any distance on the cross. McCormack raced past the near post, got in front of the defender and held the ball up on the byline - a very unselfish move as the position he found himself in was clearly not a goalscoring one.</p> <p>This was not an easy game to play in for him either as Watford took an early 2-0 lead and sat deep. When Cardiff had the ball they were rarely able to break the defensive line and Watford's back four remained in position to defend crosses. Consequently he had little space in the penalty box to exploit.</p> <p>He was pushed wide after 70 minutes and played the role well, carving out another good opportunity for himself and getting the balance between coming inside to create a problem for his marker and retaining some width just right.</p> <p>I am not surprised he could not stop scoring before I saw him and they have kept coming since. Even on the evidence of this performance there were plenty of positives and I can honestly say I have reported on someone who scored a hat-trick and I was less convinced about him than I am about Ross McCormack. </p> <h2>How he rates</h2> <p><strong>Age </strong>22</p> <p><strong>Born</strong> Glasgow</p> <p><strong>Position </strong>Striker</p> <p><strong>Height </strong>5ft 9in </p> <p><strong>Weight</strong> 11st 10lb</p> <p><strong>From </strong>Motherwell</p> <p><strong>Awareness </strong>7/10 </p> <p><strong>Heading </strong>8/10</p> <p><strong>Pace </strong>8/10</p> <p><strong>Shooting </strong>9/10</p> <p><strong>Team responsibility</strong> 9/10</p> <p><strong>Valuation </strong>\u00a31.2m</p>",
  "<h2>Ed Pilkington in Brooklyn, New York</h2> <p>A collective fever, marked by flu-like symptoms ranging from clammy palms to night sweats and a permanent low-level nausea, seems to have settled over liberal America and it shows no sign of dissipating unless and until Barack Obama's victory is beyond the slightest doubt.</p> <p>The outbreak of shared agony is on vivid display outside the food co-op in Park Slope, Brooklyn. If New York city epitomises liberal America; and if Park Slope, a neighbourhood of Brooklyn heavily peopled by writers, artists and other creative souls, epitomises left-leaning New York; then the co-op epitomises left-leaning Park Slope.</p> <p>The supermarket is owned entirely by its customers: to shop there you have to belong to the management cooperative. Every customer pledges to work unpaid for three hours a month, running the tills, stocking the shelves, doing the inventory. In return they all have a stake in the company and are able to buy environmentally-sound, organic produce grown locally and for a fraction of the price charged by the big chains.</p> <p>With such a rationale, it is hardly surprising that Republicans and John McCain supporters are conspicuous by their absence. This is aisle-to-aisle Obama country.</p> <p>Alex Holt had just completed his shift on the checkout counter. \"I was wearing an Obama badge on my jacket, and I wondered to myself what would happen if I put on a McCain pin. I was tempted to do it as a social experiment,\" he said.</p> <p>Most shoppers/workers described their state as being somewhere between excitement that Obama might be about to win, and uncontrollable anxiety that the Democratic cause was about to be ravaged once again.</p> <p>\"Everyone's saying it's fine, but I'm still worried,\" said Tamara. \"I'm worried about all the ignorant people - I don't mean that pejoratively, I mean uninformed people - who are out there and who will swing it away from Obama.\"</p> <p>Lascelles Aboagye, who moved a few years ago from Park Slope out to Long Island and now travels 20 miles to shop at the co-op, sees possible trickery ahead. \"I don't take anything for granted - anything can happen. This is America: people can steal the election even if you win it fair and square.\"</p> <p>A similar combination of apprehension and bitter resignation has been reported in liberal population centres across the US, from the coastal bastions of New York and California to oases such as Ann Arbor in Michigan and Austin in Texas. The experience of winning the popular vote but losing the election in 2000, amid the surreal dispute over Florida's hanging chads and the casting vote of the conservative-dominated supreme court judges, left many liberals shellshocked.</p> <p>Then when John Kerry lost in 2004, amid a close result in Ohio which many left-leaning Americans are convinced was manipulated, the sense of disbelief hardened into cynicism. \"I remember painfully vividly what it was like sitting through election night in 2000,\" said Josh Rabinowitz, a music director in Park Slope. \"Going through that whole craziness was traumatic, then Kerry happened and that reinforced a sense of hopelessness.\"</p> <p>This year people tell Rabinowitz they feel optimistic about an Obama victory, but that doesn't make him feel less queasy. He soothes himself by obsessive monitoring of the left-inclined cable news channel, MSNBC, and by eating and drinking. \"Every time I get stressed out I eat my kids' Halloween candy.\"</p> <p>Exceptional times create exceptional coping mechanisms. One Park Slope food co-op member said a man in her block of apartments had stopped shaving until victory day; his beard was already long and bushy. Elsewhere across the liberal heartlands, a woman from Denver was reported to have put her love life on hold until the Colorado result came in, while a psychotherapist from Manhattan's Upper West Side said about 90% of her patients were raising electoral fears in their therapy sessions.</p> <p>Park Slope's backing for Obama was first evidenced in the primaries, when the neighbourhood bucked the local trend and voted 55% for the senator for Illinois to 45% for New York's Hillary Clinton. The area boasts an unnaturally high quotient of artists, which perhaps helps explain the tendency. The novelist couples Paul Auster and Siri Hustvedt and Jonathan Safran Foer and Nicole Krauss live here, as do actors Paul Bettany and Maggie Gyllenhaal.</p> <p>Republican supporters are so rare in the Slope that when one couple put McCain 08 placards in their garden, they attracted such attention that the New York Times were drawn to publish an article on them under the headline: \"An outpost in the blue sea of Brooklyn.\"</p> <p>Local clothes stores have placed Obama masks over all their mannequins. One Park Slope hair salon offers \"Updos for Obama\" - hair-styling in the fashion of Sarah Palin, but with all proceeds from the $75 groom going to the Democratic candidate's campaign.</p> <p>With nervous energy running so high, volunteering for the Obama cause is at record levels. Rabinowitz had never participated in or contributed towards a political campaign in his life. \"I've been pretty apathetic in terms of politics,\" he said. But last month he gathered a team of friends and organised a fundraiser that generated $153,000 for the Obama campaign. This weekend he and his family were in Pennsylvania knocking on doors to help get out the vote in that battleground state.</p> <p>Jason D'Angelo, walking home with his weekly shopping from the food co-op, is another Park Slope resident who has found himself becoming politically active for the first time. He was preparing to spend the afternoon phone banking from his living room. \"If you are doing something about it, you feel a lot better,\" he said. \"The worse thing would be to wake up on Wednesday morning and realise the horror has happened all over again.\"</p> <h2>Paul Harris in Orange, Texas</h2> <p>The man did not want to stop and chat or give his name. But he was willing to explain the one, simple reason why he was planning to cast his vote for John McCain. \"I am not for socialism. Let's just put it at that way,\" he snapped and then stalked angrily into the local Wal-Mart in the small town of Orange, deep in the heart of Red State America.</p> <p>Such sentiments are not uncommon on the streets of Texas's suburbs and small towns. As America - if polls are to be believed - stands on the edge of electing Barack Obama, the mood of the Republican heartland is not a good one. There is anger and some fear at the end of eight years of Republican control of the White House. </p> <p>Much of that is stoked by conservative talk radio. Yesterday morning the Texan airwaves were full of ultra-conservative pundits predicting a socialist takeover of America, the \"nationalisation\" of the healthcare industry and warning that American business would be legislated and unionised to death. \"It's going to be a different world,\" warned talkshow host Glenn Beck on one broadcast. </p> <p>Despite the prospect of America's first black president, the talk is far more about economics than race. For many Republicans, especially in diehard areas such as Texas, much of that debate has been framed around the old buzzwords of socialism and even Marxism. The traditional Republican attacks of portraying Democrats as too willing to spend and too eager to tax are dominating the discussion. </p> <p>That message certainly seems to have struck a chord in Orange. Tucked away in the far south-eastern corner of the state, Orange is solidly Republican when it comes to picking presidents. In 2004 it voted for President George Bush over Democratic challenger John Kerry by 64% to 36%. Even in the wildest dreams of Democratic strategists, Obama is not going to overcome that 28% gap.</p> <p>Standing next to his pick-up truck construction business worker Will Clarke, 52, said he feared Obama would raise his taxes. He saw Obama as an old fashioned liberal Democrat who wanted to take money out of wallets and put it to use in government projects. </p> <p>\"I am worried. Yes, I am. What he wants to do does sound a little like socialism to me,\" he said. \"Obama is one of those politicians who wants to increase government spending. Joe the plumber got it right.\"</p> <p>There is little doubt that \"Joe the plumber\" is a famous name here, fulfilling the McCain campaign's fervent hope. The Ohio plumber, Joe Wurzelbacher, has been adopted as a campaign totem by the Republicans after publicly confronting Obama, taking him to task over his tax policy on a campaign swing through his home state. </p> <p>Now Wurzelbacher campaigns on the stump with McCain. He is meant to symbolise the \"ordinary Joe\" of America's heartland. And in Orange, the Texas version of Joe in the shape of Clarke is solidly for McCain, even as he understands that Obama will likely be the next resident of the White House. \"I am voting for McCain. I have no doubt about that,\" he said.</p> <p>But much of the Republican anger was directed at President Bush not Obama. \"Bush is just about the sorriest president that we ever had. Bush has ruined this country,\" said RC Fletcher as he shopped for groceries. Fletcher, an elderly white veteran of the Korean war, said he hoped McCain beats Obama. \"I like McCain. I want him to edge it,\" he said. But he added that he had no real problems if that did not happen. \"I think Obama is a smart guy. How could he mess it up more than Bush?\"</p> <p>The other main line of attack in recent weeks from the McCain campaign has been to lambast Obama as lacking experience in foreign affairs. He has been shown as too willing to talk to America's enemies and sit down with potentially hostile governments such as Iran, Cuba and Venezuela. Among many Republicans those arguments have resonated. Texas is a place where a muscular sense of patriotism comes with the territory. It is the home of the cowboy, and even the Bush presidency has not entirely tarnished the idea of translating those ideals into the White House. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Obama, a Chicago liberal with an academic style of lofty rhetoric, is seen as someone who will make America weak. \"He's just a talker. He talks real well but that is not enough. I think he could make America a lot weaker with other countries,\" said Kenneth Brashears, 75.</p> <p>Brashears was always likely to vote for McCain. He served with a relative of McCain's in the navy during Vietnam, and both were under the command of McCain's father. \"McCain policy. He's got more experience. He's got the guts for it,\" he said. </p> <p>That sentiment was echoed by Clarke. He felt that Obama would reduce American power. That is a powerful image at a moment of national crisis. Though America remains the world's only superpower, the prospect of a rising China is on everyone's minds, even in far-flung rural Texas. \"America will be weaker in the world under Obama. He won't look after America's interests. Or at least not like McCain would,\" said Clarke.</p> <p>There is little doubt which way Orange will vote on election day. McCain will win big here. But, among some Republicans, there are signs that Obama might do better than Kerry did. Cradling her child as she shopped at Wal-Mart, Teresa Young, a 36-year-old housewife, said she was probably going to vote for Obama. </p> <p>\"I like him. That is very unusual for me and my family to like a Democrat,\" she said. </p> <p>Her main concern was the struggle to make ends meet. To her ears increasing government spending and universal healthcare sounded like a lifeline, not the spectre of a socialist takeover. \"We would usually vote for McCain, I guess. But right now Obama is more in tune with the issues I care about.\"</p>",
  "<p>From four-year-olds being bundled off to pre-school to freshers embarking on their undergraduate studies, autumn has traditionally been the start of the academic year. But is there any reason why it should be?</p> <p>Seemingly not. Plenty of universities - though primarily the newer ones - now offer dual- or even triple-entry start dates for undergraduate courses, and students seem to appreciate the benefits.</p> <p>But first, a bit of history: what prompted the original September/October start?</p> <p>\"It could well be that the start of the Michaelmas term reflected the needs of an agricultural economy,\" says John Clarke, professor of history at the University of Buckingham, which operates three undergraduate start dates and uses the traditional long summer break as a fourth term.</p> <p>\"Obviously, harvest was the time when demand for labour was greatest. Without modern machinery it was essential to use every hand available to get the crops in before the weather broke. This explanation is open to the objection that those going up to Oxford or Cambridge would have been of a social status incompatible with manual labour of any kind. This may have been true from the late 17th century to around world war two, but in earlier times the proportion of undergraduates from quite humble origins was rather higher.\"</p> <p>The other explanation, he continues, concerned the need to avoid contact with disease. \"Most epidemics, particularly plague, tended to occur in the summer months, and towns were especially vulnerable.\" Hence the long vacation away from centres of learning in July, August and September.</p> <p>However, back to the present day, and these rationales for the old-style academic year have disappeared. There are many advantages to being able to start a course at different points in the year.</p> <p>Finding accommodation more easily is one advantage. For hayfever sufferers who start their degree courses in the new year rather than in autumn, big exams - particularly finals - will take place outside of the problem months. Trivial though this may sound, for those seriously affected, the befuddlement of a prolonged allergic reaction throughout the revision period as well as during exams could impact badly on their final result.</p> <p>There is also the argument of convenience. If you're a mature student who is perhaps considering a degree after a period in work, why would you want to wait months to get going? The option of two or three entry dates is also often welcomed by employers who may want to sponsor an employee.</p> <p>For someone who starts a degree course that doesn't work out, the chance to begin another course that same year can mean the difference between retrieving a tricky situation and having to cope with a potentially career-wrecking disaster.</p> <p>For Lauren Cohen, 19, now studying for a BA in business management at Anglia Ruskin, rushing into a degree at one university meant she hated her course and left before the Christmas of her first term.</p> <p>\"I did think I'd have to start again in September, but being able to start here in the new year meant I didn't have to lose nine months,\" she explains. \"I would have had to get a job in the meantime, and might have got used to the money and not carried on with doing a degree.\"</p> <p>On degrees that require work placements, students who end up in smaller cohorts because the year's intake is split over two or three start dates may also find they get a better experience at an academic, practical and pastoral level.</p> <p>\"If you're starting in a smaller group, then not only the nursing staff who are supervising you on placement, but also your tutors, have a chance to get to know and understand your motivation in a more detailed way,\" explains Gemma Rooke, 27, who started her adult nursing degree at City University last January.</p> <p>It has meant, she says, that tutors can advise her on securing placements that have stimulated her interests.</p> <p>\"At my request, I've been lucky enough to get to spend some time with a clinical nurse specialist, and if there were more of you descending on a ward all at once you might not get that so easily,\" Rooke says. \"There's certainly an advantage to being one or just two students on a ward at a time, as the nursing staff you're shadowing have more time to explain what's going on.\"</p> <p>Overseas students wishing to study in the UK can discover that dual- or triple-entry start dates make courses more accessible, says Alan Cain, marketing director for Anglia Ruskin university. \"The standard October start reflects the British education timetable. For international students whose academic years may be different, the option to start in January, February or March as we do can be very useful.\" International students may also need to complete an English course before starting on their degree, he points out, so a new year start date for their degree can dovetail nicely.</p> <p>At Napier University, which offers a new year entry as well as an autumn start, Ted Finch, head of customised programmes, points out that international students can also have trouble getting their visas, so being flexible about when a course kicks off means that the UK doesn't lose these students to other countries.</p> <p><strong>Financial sense</strong></p> <p>The University of Buckingham only recently inaugurated an October intake, explains Gerry Loftus, head of English. The degrees beginning in January are three months shorter than if a student starts in the autumn, and for undergraduates who are tight on cash, such as 29-year-old </p> <p>Raymond Sarr from the Gambia, who is studying economics, business and law, being able to gain a BA by working intensively for two years rather than the more standard and leisurely three makes much better financial sense.</p> <p>For the third year running, Buckingham has just come top for student satisfaction in the National Student Survey run by the Higher Education Funding Council for England, so it appears that the flexible approach to start dates is exactly what some students want. Given the competition for undergraduate bums on lecture theatre seats - and the funding that accompanies them - maybe other, more traditional universities will soon be following suit.</p>",
  "<p>Family doctors are to be paid \u00a3100 a time for carrying out an annual health check on people with learning disabilities, after an official inquiry warned that they were suffering avoidable ill health and even premature death because their needs were being ignored.</p> <p>The health secretary, Alan Johnson, has instructed the NHS to make improving healthcare for people with learning disabilities a priority and has admitted they have been the victims of \"horrific health services failures\".</p> <p>But the British Medical Association has demanded that its GP members be paid extra for the annual health checks - and ministers have conceded. They have set aside \u00a344m for special payments to doctors across England over the next two years.</p> <p>The move comes just weeks after the Commons public accounts committee criticised \"eyewatering\" pay increases for GPs under a new contract that saw their salaries rise by an average 58% over three years while their working hours were reduced. The average annual salary of GPs is about \u00a3113,000.</p> <p>Under the Disability Discrimination Act, businesses are required to arrange and pay for \"reasonable adjustments\" to their services to make them suitable for disabled people. As independent contractors to the NHS, GPs are bound by the act. However, the BMA has refused to agree to annual health checks without payment.</p> <p>A BMA spokeswoman said: \"This is over and above what is provided for in the national contract and a recognition that GPs will be doing more work for patients with a learning disability.\"</p> <p>The inquiry into the healthcare of people with learning disabilities was published in July. Its chair, Sir Jonathan Michael, said local NHS primary care trusts should be directed to introduce annual health checks as a means of ensuring that reasonable adjustments were made.</p> <p>In a pilot scheme in Wales, health checks among people with learning disabilities identified previously undetected conditions including diabetes, hypertension and asthma.</p> <p>The checks in England will apply to an estimated 240,000 people. GP practices will be paid \u00a350 upfront for each one and a further \u00a350 after it has been carried out.</p> <p>Learning disability charities welcomed the agreement. David Congdon, policy director of Mencap, said: \"The view was that if \u00a320m a year was all we were talking about to oil the wheels - in the context of \u00a3100bn spending on the NHS - then it was a price worth paying to win significant health gains.\"</p>",
  "<p>Jimmy Carl Black, who has died of cancer aged 70, was drummer and sometimes lead vocalist with Frank Zappa's Mothers of Invention between 1965 and the group's bitter break-up in 1970. The Mothers created concerts and albums that mixed pop-Dada, 1950s doo-wop, jazz, schmaltz, Stravinsky, Var\u00e8se and Webern. Black was to the fore as Lonesome Cowboy Burt, a highlight of Zappa's 200 Motels movie (1971). He was the man who introduced himself as \"the Indian of the group\" on the band's album, We're Only in It for the Money (1968), and was a central figure in If We'd All Been Living in California, a dialogue on corporate finances on Uncle Meat (1969).</p> <p>Black, who inherited Cheyenne blood from his mother, was born in El Paso, Texas, but grew up in nearby Anthony on the New Mexican border. He was a soloist in his high school band's brass section, \"but I realised that there was no chance in rock'n'roll for a trumpeter, after Elvis Presley appeared at El Paso Coliseum in 1955. When I saw the effect he had on those women, I thought, 'Man. That's what I want to do!'\"</p> <p>Though he could strum a guitar and had had piano lessons, Black bought a drum kit and practised by playing along mostly to black rhythm and blues records. While serving in the US air force, he joined a country and western trio, Them Three Guys, and, following demobilisation in 1958, played mainstream pop with the Surfs and then the Keys - with whom Black recorded Stretch Pants (1962).</p> <p>Two years later, he moved to Los Angeles, and formed the Soul Giants, who played LA dance halls. When the guitarist was drafted into the army, he was replaced by Zappa, who told the band, according to Black, that \"if you guys learn my music, I'll make you rich and famous\".</p> <p>\"He took care of half of that promise,\" said Black, \"because I'm damn sure I didn't get rich.\" Renamed the Mothers of Invention, the group followed Zappa's masterplan to a qualified prosperity via concerts and, later, albums. \"Frank made me aware of modern classical stuff,\" said Black, \"and very patiently taught me all those complex rhythms and time signatures.\"</p> <p>But Black became increasingly unhappy about Zappa's control. He resented the enlistment of a second drummer, and Zappa claiming authorship of tracks such as If We'd All Been Living in California. \"I never knew he'd taped it at a band meeting,\" he complained. \"I wasn't credited. Everything was 'written, arranged and produced by Frank Zappa'. Then a week after a successful tour, he called us together and said, 'I've decided to break up the band. Your salaries have stopped as from last week.' It was a big shock. I had five kids to feed.\"</p> <p>Postscripts to Black's tenure with Zappa embraced his role in 200 Motels, and an exhumation in 1981 of his character in it, Lonesome Cowboy Burt, for Harder Than Your Husband on Zappa's You Are What You Is album.</p> <p>In 1972 Black had success with two albums as leader of Geronimo Black, named after his youngest son. But by 1974 a Melody Maker interview was conducted in Winebel's Donuts, where he was, indeed, making doughnuts.</p> <p> He then moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico, released a solo album, Clearly Classic, which achieved minimal circulation, and joined a Captain Beefheart and his Magic Band world tour.</p> <p>Black then settled in Austin, Texas, where he established the Gentlemen of Colour, a building-and-decorating business with Arthur Brown, the English star of the 1960s Crazy World of Arthur Brown. The firm flourished for 10 years - as did an artistic liaison which was to culminate in an album of R&amp;B standards, Brown, Black and Blue (1980). Black was also performing with Eugene Chadbourne - \"the free-est form guitar player I've ever met\" - and the Grandmothers, initially, former Mothers band members fronted by the Italian guitarist and Frank Zappa lookalike Sandro Oliva. Their CDs included a concert recorded in 1998 at London's Astoria theatre.</p> <p>Increasing success in Europe led Black to move to Vicenza, Italy with his then wife, a schoolteacher with the US army. After her death, he moved to Germany, home of his second wife Monika. In 1995 he began playing with the Muffin Men, the best British interpreters of the work of Zappa and Beefheart. Black was on the road with the group as recently as 2007. Assisted by Roddie Gilliard of the Muffin Men, he was working on an autobiography, For Mother's Sake.</p> <p>He is survived by Monika, three sons and two daughters.</p> <p>\u2022 James Carl Inkanish Black, drummer and singer, born February 1 1938; died November 1 2008</p>",

  "<p>I grew up in Lozells, Birmingham, which is notorious for drugs, prostitution and gang culture. There were occasions when I had to carry a knife just to protect myself. I'm lucky not to have been shot or stabbed. But I did come close. I'd get caught up in fights with the friends I hung around with and things could get ugly. One time, I had my arm slashed in a fight. Another time, I almost got shot - a car pulled up alongside me and someone pointed a gun in my face. It was a case of mistaken identity. </p> <p>I left school at 16 and got a job in a warehouse. I was earning good money and life was OK. Things went wrong after my arm was slashed. I needed months of physiotherapy, so I had to sign on. I was really low, and it was then that the drinking started. I was living in a hostel - my parents had got fed up with the police coming round.</p> <p>Everything seemed to go wrong at once: my girlfriend had a miscarriage, a friend was shot dead on his birthday, then another friend, two weeks later. All my anger built up and I attacked someone at the hostel. I was warned that if I didn't sort myself out, I'd have to leave.</p> <p>They put me in touch with the charity Fairbridge, which supports young people not in education or training. I got involved with a media project that involved shooting a film about life in Lozells, which was brilliant. At the London Imax screening I gave a speech to 300 people working in the media and appealed for work experience. </p> <p>A few months later, the Media Trust asked if I'd like to be part of a youth mentoring programme, which would involve a trip to Germany for the G8 summit. I was paired with Philip Webster, the political editor at the Times. It was an amazing experience. There I was, a young guy from Lozells, sitting 15 feet away from George Bush and Tony Blair. </p> <p>While I was out there, I kept a video diary for the community TV channel and wrote a feature for Times Online. I was interviewed on Richard and Judy, ITV's On The Couch and various radio stations. The experience gave me a taste for journalism. I'd had the idea that politics had nothing to do with people in deprived communities like Lozells. It has everything to do with them. </p> <p>I wanted a career in journalism, and I found out that the National Council for the Training of Journalists has a diversity fund. I passed the pre-entry examination for the year-long NCTJ course at Harlow College, Essex, and was awarded a bursary. I started in September.

  "<p>The government yesterday warned banks it will keep a close eye on the \u00a337bn of taxpayer funds used to rescue the industry after it announced an \"arm's length company\" to manage the cash.</p> <p>The Treasury said it wanted to protect investments in Lloyds TSB, HBOS and Royal Bank of Scotland and \"create value\" for taxpayers without harming the industry and restricting competition.</p> <p>Northern Rock and Bradford &amp; Bingley, which the government nationalised this year, will also come under the control of the government-owned company, UK Financial Investments Ltd (UKFI).</p> <p>The chancellor, Alistair Darling, confirmed Sir Philip Hampton as chairman of the new body and Treasury official John Kingman as chief executive. Hampton is a former finance director of Lloyds TSB and most recently chairman of supermarket group J Sainsbury, while Kingman, who played a central role in the rescue of Northern Rock, is the second-most senior civil servant at the finance ministry.</p> <p>Top of the agenda for Hampton and Kingman will be persuading banks to use government funds to help individual homeowners struggling with mortgages and small businesses in need of loans. </p> <p>They will also be given the task of ending the \"rewards for excessive risk\" culture in the City widely considered to be a major factor in the financial crisis.</p> <p>The Treasury said: \"The company will work to ensure management incentives for banks are based on maximising long-term value and restricting the potential for rewarding failure. </p> <p>\"It will also oversee the conditions of the recapitalisation fund, including maintaining, over the next three years, the availability and active marketing of competitively priced lending to homeowners and small businesses at 2007 levels.\"</p> <p>The Treasury said the company's board will include another three non-executive, private sector members and a second, as yet unnamed, Treasury official. It said: \"These roles will be filled by individuals of relevant commercial skill and experience to enable UKFI to best meet its objectives, which will be to protect and create value for the taxpayer as shareholders, with due regard to financial stability and acting in a way that promotes competition.\" </p> <p>The Liberal Democrat party was concerned ministers might recruit private sector managers with little experience of recession and the decisions that must be made during an economic downturn. Lord Oakeshott, Lib Dem Treasury spokesman, wanted to see non-executives who have \"been round the block a few times\". He said they should be at least 60 years old to justify the faith of taxpayers, whose funds would in effect be in their hands.</p> <p>He also warned it was evident banks were seeking to escape government strictures on their activities. Oakeshott said the UKFI \"would have its work cut out bringing a more realistic bonus structure and lending policies into force. For this to be put into action you need experienced hands at the helm\".</p> <h2>Rock star</h2> <p><strong>John Kingman</strong>, regarded inside the civil service as affable and highly intelligent, was promoted to number two at the Treasury in October 2007 at the age of 38. The son of Sir John Kingman, former vice-chancellor of Bristol University, he was tipped for the top from early in his career, taking time out as a <strong>Lex writer </strong>at the <strong>Financial Times</strong> to gain much needed business experience. </p> <p>He was at the heart of discussions over the fate of <strong>Northern Rock</strong> when as managing director of the Treasury's public service and growth directorate he was in charge of sorting out the future of the Newcastle-based mortgage lender when it came close to collapse last September.</p> <p>He has reportedly told friends the Northern Rock rescue was the most difficult issue he had ever had to deal with. He favoured <strong>nationalisation</strong> from early in the process - the option which the government eventually plumped for. </p> <p>He reprised his emergency banking rescue role in the run-up to the latest bank rescue when he was drafted in to support his colleague <strong>Tom Scholar.</strong> Kingman was tasked with implementing the plan, and Scholar given the job of trying to persuade other EU countries to adopt the British proposals.</p>",
  "<p>The confidence of the public and the courts in the use of community sentences is being undermined by a lack of information about their effectiveness, according to a Commons committee report today.</p> <p>The MPs' report claims the Ministry of Justice does not have basic information on the 120,000 community orders issued each year, including whether offenders actually complete them or the reasons why they fail to finish them.</p> <p>Community sentences were introduced under 2003 legislation to provide a credible alternative to jail. Judges and magistrates can impose 12 possible \"requirements\" on offenders, including anger management courses, drug and alcohol treatment, and unpaid work in the community.</p> <p>But the report by the Commons public accounts committee says the use of these requirements to tackle the underlying causes of crime has been disappointing, with wide variations around the country. In particular, the use of drug and alcohol treatment courses is low.</p> <p>The report says the justice ministry collects national data on the total number of requirements completed by each offender, but not the completion rates for the individual requirements, or for community sentences as a whole.</p> <p>Edward Leigh, chairman of the public accounts committee, said: \"It does nothing for confidence ... in community orders, among both sentencers and the public, if no one knows how many have been completed by offenders.\"</p>",

  "<p>The HIV/Aids epidemic will spiral out of control unless more money and effort is devoted to stopping its spread, the UK's development minister, Gareth Thomas, will warn a meeting of scientists and experts convened by the government in London today.</p> <p>Although UN statistics show an apparent slow-down in the growth of the epidemic, and drugs to keep people alive are now at least partly available in heavily affected parts of the developing world, Thomas will stress that all the progress will be in vain unless a means is found to stop the spread of infection.</p> <p>\"The reality is that the spread of HIV is set to spiral out of control unless we act now,\" he will say. \"Five people are infected with HIV every minute. We must increase our efforts - and increase them now.\"</p> <p>The message is backed by a new UK \u00a3220m fund for research into technological solutions to halt the spread, such as vaccines and microbicide gels, which women could use during sex.</p> <p>Five more people are infected for every two who are put on life-saving drugs, 33 million people now live with the virus and 15 million children have been orphaned. </p> <p>The government's warning is a departure from recent international rhetoric about the progress being made against Aids. The latest UNAids report on the state of the pandemic, in July, said the epidemic was slowing and highlighted countries such as Rwanda and Zimbabwe, where warnings about more cautious sexual behaviour seemed to be gaining ground.</p> <p>Although the roll-out of Aids drugs is saving some lives, only around 3 million in the developing world have them. The focus has now switched to preventing infection, but there is a long way to go. Wider condom use has not taken off, for social and cultural reasons, and all efforts to develop a vaccine have failed, due to the propensity of the virus to mutate.</p> <p>The new \u00a3220m research fund is likely to go to scientists working on new technologies such as a vaccine, a microbicide or drugs based on those now used for treatment, which might be able to protect the partners of HIV sufferers.</p> <p>\"Only through research will we find ways to halt this epidemic,\" Thomas said. \"I hope this funding will help discover new life-saving technology.\"</p>",
  "<p>Paul Roy, the chairman of the British Horseracing Authority, said yesterday that he is \"hopeful\" that the latest knife-edge agreement on the betting levy will also be the last. Racing and the bookmakers agreed a new scheme on Friday, just hours before the deadline that would have forced a determination by the government, and both sides will now work to modernise and streamline the process ahead of next year's negotiations. </p> <p>In what seems to be an acknowledgement that racing's ambitions for a truly commercial funding arrangement are unlikely to be realised, Roy said that the Levy Board itself is now fully engaged in modernising the system. </p> <p>\"The whole process is pretty archaic and I think there is room for fundamental change,\" Roy said. \"What we want is a proper relationship between racing and the bookmakers, and we are all working with the same intention, which is to maximise profitability. The bookmaking industry is quite a broad church and you could say the same of racing, but Chris [Bell] of Ladbrokes managed to pull his side together and we managed to pull racing together and we have avoided a determination, which no-one wanted.\" </p> <p>An important part of Friday's deal was the BHA's agreement to re-instate racing on a number of Sundays early next year which had previously been left blank. </p> <p>\"This isn't intended to be a cheap political shot,\" Roy said, \"but the bookmakers have consistently talked about other products, whether it be virtual racing, FOBTs or whatever, and how racing is lessening in importance, but the interesting thing [in the negotiations] was their requirement very much to put on more racing.\" </p> <p>The key element of the deal from racing's point of view is that the BHA has maintained the \"headline rate of 10%\" of bookmakers' gross profits as the basis of their Levy payments. Roy, a City man for 30 years, believes this is particularly important in the current financial climate. </p> <p>\"I don't want to sound like a harbinger of doom,\" Roy said, \"but racing needs to have a reality check. In my first speech as BHA chairman [in 2007] I said my fear for racing was that it had not put on the poundage by growing its customer base and ownership and all those sort of things during a period of unprecedented wealth creation, and of what might happen when the economy entered a downturn.\" </p> <p>Roy's colours have been a familiar sight on British tracks in recent years. Even he, though, is cutting back on his bloodstock interests. \"In 30 years, I've never seen the sort of dislocation in the markets that we have now,\" he said. </p> <p>\"I've not been as active at the sales as I have been before,\" Roy said, \"and I've probably bought half as many horses as last year, though in part that is due to home-breds taking up the slack. I would expect that there will be a lot of people in the same boat.\"</p>",
  "<p>What happens to social mobility now depends on the depth of the recession, how many are unemployed, and for how long. If there are no jobs for young people leaving school, university or apprenticeships, there could be another lost generation. If the Tories take over, nothing they say now, as they mock Keynesian solutions, suggests they have learned from the last two recessions how to limit consequent social damage.</p> <p>But for now, until the blow strikes, the latest figures suggest Labour may be making real social progress. The Cabinet Office report yesterday drew together research on social mobility showing that since 2000, in education, jobs and low pay, things are getting a bit better. So they should be. Labour has toiled for 11 years at improving education and life chances. Now the green shoots of modest success are breaking through. Most striking, for the first time it seems parental income is having a diminishing impact on pupils' GCSE results. That is what a Labour government is for.</p> <p>Most of the report is a reminder, however, of how far there is to go, how far Britain is behind, and how much class still determines destiny. Here's the history: the 50s and 60s saw a surge in upward mobility - a sudden demand for more white-collar jobs, more skilled work and more managers saw a two-thirds manual working-class society transformed into a two-thirds white collar, home-owning, middle-class society. But in about 1970, that one-off surge stopped. Those who imagined this was ineluctable onward progress were disappointed. Between 1970 and 2000 there was no further upward mobility.</p> <p>Academics whose work is used in this report were cautious yesterday. True results in social mobility research take a generation, not a decade. But there are hopeful signs. More poor pupils are getting five good GCSEs, thereby outdoing their parents. But whether they will outdo them in later life depends on whether their relative position changes, or if they just stay in the same pecking order among a better educated generation. For that reason, the report emphasises the need for Britain to seize a higher proportion of the world's highly skilled jobs over the next generation - it's the number of high-quality jobs that help determine how many move up.</p> <p>The real social audit of the Labour era cannot be known for years. The party's impact will be strongest on the youngest children in the 3,000 Sure Start centres rolled out since 2000. If those at most risk of failing are helped before they reach school, that may be changing destinies. But don't expect clear results for two or three decades.</p> <p>A useful comparator is the US's High/Scope Perry scheme under Lyndon Johnson; it wasn't until the deprived children in that programme reached the age of 30 that it became clear how much they had benefited. Compared with a control group of similar children, those with two years of nursery schooling and family support were remarkably protected from danger: fewer ended up in prison, mental hospital or on social security, and more had jobs and owned a home. Already findings from Britain's Effectiveness Provision of Preschool Education research show how much better children do at the age of 10 in reading and maths if they have had high- or even medium-quality nursery education. If Sure Start grows and flourishes undamaged by future governments, here is Labour's best legacy.</p> <p>But there will be no scientific proof. If by 2030 social mobility has taken an upward swing, if crime keeps falling and schools keep turning out fewer unqualified children, there will be plenty of intervening governments to claim the credit for programmes of their own.</p> <p>Uncomfortable truths remain. Britain does badly on social mobility for the same old reason: cavernous pay inequality. Yesterday's report suggests low-paid men are doing slightly better - more secure in their jobs, and helped by tax credits and the minimum wage - but not low-paid women.</p> <p>A truth the government has never acknowledged is that it is almost impossible to have high social mobility, in which children rise and fall according to their own talents and character, unless a society itself is reasonably equal and fair. If the ladder is long and steep, few can climb it. Labour has nothing to say about the millions who will always be cleaners, carers, or caterers and who deserve to be paid enough to live with a respectable status, as they do in the Nordic countries that have the most mobility. Here's an example of double-think: when community activists London Citizens asked the Department for Children, Schools and Families to pay their cleaners the London living wage of \u00a37.45 an hour, they received the stock answer that it would \"distort labour markets\" and \"raise inflation expectations\". This was despite the department's own exhortations to other London employers to sign a pledge to pay the very same London living wage.</p> <p>However, Labour has tried hard. There are 600,000 fewer poor children, and spending on education has more than doubled, hugely improving the quality of teaching and schools - though there is much more to do. One thing is certain. If a future Conservative government spends less and squeezes resources again, these green shoots will wither. No doubt the Tories have good intentions. They, too, \"aspire\" to abolish child poverty and to keep social mobility moving upwards, but their priorities are different. \"Sharing the proceeds of growth\" means tax cuts come before improving children's prospects. Interviewed yesterday, shadow work and pensions secretary Chris Grayling clung to a bonus for \"robust marriage\" as the answer to social mobility, which holds out little hope. George Osborne says in a recession he would borrow only what was compulsory for paying unemployment benefits: that means cuts all round as tax receipts fall.</p> <p>At least much of Labour's legacy would survive: Sure Start, better schools, the minimum wage, some level of tax credits. As ever, Labour governments make social progress, followed by Conservative years of social stagnation. There will be deep regrets and recriminations that Labour didn't do more in the good times; it never tried to shift Britain's culture of profound inequality. As a result Labour's successes may not be given due recognition - until the day comes when we get a rude reminder of the alternative.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:polly.toynbee@theguardian.com\">polly.toynbee@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Chicago is bracing itself for a huge and possibly chaotic street party as more than a million people are expected to descend on the city centre tonight in anticipation of a victory for Democratic presidential hopeful, Barack Obama.</p> <p>Obama, who lives in the city, has planned a public party in Grant Park which is in the downtown area. The campaign issued more than 70,000 tickets for the event but they were sold out in a matter of hours. Nonetheless, huge numbers are expected to come into the city anyway, prompting a security clampdown, concern about public safety and some businesses to send employees home early.</p> <p>\"It's going to be surprising,\" mayor Richard Daley told the Chicago Tribune. \"There are going to be a lot of people who want to come down to celebrate. We hope it's a million or more - that's realistic. It's going to be wonderful. Only the private event is ticket[ed]. You can be in the park and around it ... You think I'm nuts? You think I'm not going to invite people down? The mayor's not going to tell anybody not to come to this celebration. It's a historic event. If they want to be there, they should.\"</p> <p>Republican contender John McCain is scheduled to hold a far more low-key affair in his home state of Arizona at the Biltmore resort and spa, where he's expected to address roughly 2,000 people.</p> <p>The scale of Obama's event in Chicago is causing a logistical nightmare for the local law enforcement. Last Friday police superintendent Jody Weis warned: \"We can't have foolishness. We can't have mischief.\" </p> <p>Last week helicopters flew low over Hutchinson Field, the part of Grant Park where the rally will take place, while police scoured rooftops on downtown buildings. All Chicago police officers have had leave cancelled for the night and firefighters have been asked to have their personal equipment handy at home. </p> <p>\"We expect a good, supportive crowd, and we expect it to be a happy occasion,\" Obama's campaign manager, David Axelrod, said. \"Whatever the result, we don't expect trouble.\"</p> <p>Even the coastguard will patrol in Burnham Harbor and on Lake Michigan, which borders the park. With traffic expected to be snarled and parking banned in large areas of the city, the decision to stage an event of this scale has proved controversial. A Chicago Tribune website poll asking whether the rally is a good idea showed the city split, with 52% in favour and 48% opposed.</p> <p>McCain's operatives have ridiculed Obama's event as typically ostentatious and self-aggrandising. \"I don't know if he is planning another Berlin moment, but we're having what will be a great victory night celebration with a lot of supporters,\" said campaign spokesman Brian Rogers, referring to the throngs that turned up to greet Obama in when he visited Europe in July.</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-339274038\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1898265898_campaign-analysis-2-16x9.flv\"/> </video>   <p>Sometimes it felt as if this day would never come. But today, the 21 long months of the 2008 presidential campaign, a saga packed with higher drama than any contest in living memory, finally comes down to a straight choice. By tonight, perhaps as many as 140 million Americans will have stepped inside a polling both, pulled back the curtain and made a quiet, private decision that will determine the course of the United States - and so the world - for the next four years.</p> <p>The two candidates have tried to frame that choice in their own terms. For Barack Obama, it has been the same, perennial pitch that challengers have made since the dawn of democratic politics: the future versus the past, change versus more of the same.</p> <p>Those were the battle lines he drew first against Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primaries, and the lines he was drawing even in the final lap of campaigning yesterday, as he tried to absorb the news of his grandmother's death and go ahead with rallies in Florida, North Carolina and Virginia: that the US could choose a new path with him, or a continuation of the Bush era with John McCain.</p> <p>McCain's pitch has never been quite as clear. At first, he suggested that Americans would be deciding between an experienced warrior and an unseasoned novice. But experience became a hard message to sell once McCain had picked Sarah Palin, governor of Alaska for just 20 months, as his running mate. So he fell back on the traditional Republican arguments: weak vs strong abroad, big vs small government at home.</p> <p>But those lines have grown blurred, not least because McCain has been the standard bearer of the party that blurred them. It's not easy to preach the message of small government when a Republican president has just spent $700bn on a partial nationalisation of the US banking system.</p> <p>McCain fuzzed the lines himself, too, with a daily barrage of different messages cumulatively suggesting that the choice was between an all-American war hero and a strange, unrooted, quasi-celebrity socialist with dodgy friends and dubious loyalties.</p> <p>In the final push, hitting seven cities in seven states yesterday, McCain found a focus at last. As if taking a leaf from the Tory playbook of 1992, he warned of a tax bombshell about to land on hard-working Americans. At every stop he has been invoking his human prop, Joe the Plumber, the everyman who, he warns, would pay more tax under Obama.</p> <p>But the choice today is not only as the candidates have framed it, even in their final 30-second TV ads: one from Obama taunting McCain for winning the endorsement of Dick Cheney (\"Boy, did he earn it\") and a Republican ad featuring the Democratic candidate's former pastor, Jeremiah Wright, bellowing \"God Damn America\". The choice is also made up of elements the candidates don't always articulate explicitly. For these two men have fundamentally different attitudes to the rest of the world.</p> <p>Obama urges engagement and dialogue \"with our enemies as well as our friends\". He stresses the importance of restoring America's standing abroad. McCain does not say so directly, but he casts the rest of the world as an essentially hostile arena, a vast \"Out There\", full of menaces that America has to stare down. In a spirited stump speech - \"The Mac is back!\" - delivered in Springfield, Virginia at the weekend, the only references to the world beyond US shores were to dictators, and to Obama's refusal to use the word \"victory\" when discussing American involvement in Iraq.</p> <p>And so McCain inadvertently confirms Obama's presentation of him as the would-be bringer of a third Bush term. For McCain reveals no difference from the president in his view of the world. In his choice of advisers, in his disdain for diplomacy - always dismissed as glorified appeasement - he makes clear that, when it comes to foreign policy, today's choice really is between change and more of the same.</p> <p>Obama says that's true of economics too, that McCain represents a continuation of the same \"on-your-own\" philosophy that has prevailed these last eight years. McCain insists that is unfair, that he has criticised Bush for letting spending get too high. But he does not offer a substantial alternative. In a late night rally at a high-school sports ground in Glen Allen, Virginia, Palin won cheers when she promised a \"pro-growth plan\" - but she never explained what this plan might include.</p> <p>So, though they could not admit it during these tough times, the Republicans are indeed offering the same Bush formula of low taxes and unfettered free markets. On Saturday, Palin even repeated the old Reagan bromide, that \"government is the problem, not the solution\". Today Americans will have to decide whether that's true - or whether they are desperate for government to role up its sleeves and help them out.</p> <p>Of course, there are other choices on offer, including one between America's demographic future and its past. Obama is the product of a mixed background, like increasing numbers of Americans. The US future, says one analyst, is not black or white, but brown, and Obama embodies that. McCain and party, meanwhile, still look - Palin apart - like a country club: old guys in blazers at the top, and white faces all around.</p> <p>Finally, Americans can see in today's vote a choice between two different ways of doing politics - and not only between the sleek efficiency of the Obama machine and the often chaotic performance of the McCain team. For it is, in part, a referendum on a style of electioneering that has dominated ever since Richard Nixon ran for Congress in 1946 suggesting his opponent was not \"one of us\". McCain, who once disdained this brand of cultural warfare, in which any Democrat is cast as unpatriotic, elitist and less than a true American, has embraced it in 2008.</p> <p>Whether it's his allies stressing Obama's middle name of Hussein, or Palin praising \"pro-America\" parts of the country, or McCain himself closing his speeches by declaring \"I'm an American\", as if his opponent is not, this year's Republican effort has been every bit as dirty as those of the past.</p> <p>If voters reject McCain today they will also be rejecting that McCarthyite brand of politics, embracing Obama's insistence that, at a time when the problems facing America are so big, it makes no sense that its politics are so small.</p> <p>This is what stands before Americans today. They can decide to see the world in a new light, full of potential partners as well as enemies, or remain in the Bush crouch of permanent warfare. They can decide it's time to address the gravest questions, or run from them, retreating into the same cultural spats that have dominated for at least 40 years. After 21 months of candidates debating and pundits yammering, it's time for the American people to speak.</p>",
  "<p>Democrats are increasingly confident that the US congressional election today will see them extend their majority in the House of Representatives and reduce the Republicans in the Senate to an ineffective rump. Polls yesterday suggest that the Democrats stand to take not only the White House, but will win seven or eight more seats in the Senate, where they already hold 51 of the 100 seats.</p> <p>A Congressional victory on that scale would help Barack Obama to avoid the fate of some of his predecessors, whose legislative plans have often been blocked by hostile Republicans.</p> <p>The Democrats, fighting the congressional race with almost as much intensity as the White House battle, poured millions of dollars into the campaign at the weekend. Obama diverted some of his funds into key Senate and House races in places such as Georgia. Democrats in Senate races had spent more than $67m, against $33.7m by the Republican candidates, as of the end of last week.</p> <p>Despite Congress reaching levels of unpopularity that rival that of President George Bush, voters surveyed by pollsters blamed the economic crisis on Republicans, rather than Democrats, who seem likely to hang on to the gains they achieved in the 2006 mid-term elections. The Democrats may fall just short of the 60 Senate seats needed to prevent the Republicans mounting legislation-blocking tactics such as filibustering.</p> <p>Larry Sabato, director of the centre for politics at the University of Virginia, said the Democrats should not become hung up on the 60 figure, and that it would not matter if they failed to reach it. \"The Republicans who are left are going to be irrelevant for the first year of the Obama administration. The Republicans will not have a major role to play,\" he said.</p> <p>He said the concentration on reaching the 60 mark was overdone, because some moderate Republican senators would probably vote with the Democrats, or face trouble being re-elected.</p> <p>Another potential problem facing a Republican rump, according to the political scientists Keith Poole and Howard Rosenthal, is that it could be more conservative than the existing Republican Senate group. According to their analysis, the Republicans most at risk of losing their seat are mainly those on the more moderate wing. A more rightwing Senate grouping might find it harder to attract voters from the centre ground in the congressional mid-term elections in 2010.</p> <p>The three Senate seats most likely to switch from the Republicans to the Democrats today are Virginia, New Mexico and Colorado. Others the Democrats hope to take include Alaska, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Oregon.</p> <p>One of the biggest victims of a Democratic rout in the Senate could be Elizabeth Dole, the conservative senator for North Carolina. Norm Coleman, the Republican incumbent in Minnesota who famously clashed with the British parliamentarian George Galloway at a Senate hearing on Iraq, is facing a close race against the Democratic candidate, the comedian Al Franken.</p> <p>To reach the filibuster-proof 60 seats in the Senate, the Democrats will need to take Georgia, Kentucky or Mississippi. That is mainly why Obama announced last Friday that he would begin advertising in Georgia. The state may prove beyond him, but the big turn-out of African-Americans in the state, attracted by his candidacy, offers an outside chance of a Senate upset.</p> <p>In the races for the House of Representatives, where the Democrats have held control since 2006, the party is expecting to extend its lead by a further 25-plus seats.</p>",
  "<p>This autumn Richard Alston celebrates both his 60th birthday and his 40th anniversary as a choreographer. Bespectacled, he radiates a vaguely professorial air; he appears serenely successful but says he takes nothing for granted. \"I feel I've been amazingly lucky. There have been moments when I've been through great waves of insecurity - feeling that I'm a has-been, that I'm finished. But I'm still here, and I'm still making dance.\" </p> <p>It is hard to put Alston's work into a single stylistic camp. Much of it is abstract, in the sense that it is about the fundamental elements of dance as an art form: space, energy and line. But it is also profoundly emotional, with a lyricism and romanticism that come from his early love of ballet. He counts Merce Cunningham as his greatest mentor, but doesn't share his absolute belief in separating dance from music. Mozart, jazz, Peter Maxwell Davies, Britten - Alston's tastes are eclectic, and whether it's the laidback songs of Hoagy Carmichael accompanying Shuffle It Right, or the splintered darkness of Heiner Goebbels creating the landscape of Red Run, music is always his prime inspiration. </p> <p>If Alston now ranks as one of the great survivors in British modern dance, he was once one of its original rebels. He came to dance late: he was 17 before he saw his first ballet, and there was no dance in his background (he was a schoolboy at Eton, and his father worked with MI6). But his timing was good. As one of the first students at the London Contemporary Dance School in the late 1960s, and then one of the first members of the London Contemporary Dance Theatre, he embarked on his career just as the modern dance scene was getting underway. He was asked to make his first work for LCDT aged just 21. </p> <p>It would have been easy for Alston to secure his future at the company, but at that age he was too restless. In 1972 he left to form the experimental collective Strider, and to \"make lots of very rigorous work which we performed in garages and gyms and art galleries\". After three years, however, Strider began to feel constrictive. \"We were doing rather well,\" Alston recalls, \"and the Arts Council invited us to become regular funded clients. I was fiercely independent and the idea was terrifying. I felt it was time to stop before I found myself in a situation that I couldn't get out of.\"</p> <p>He left London for New York. \"It was one of the best times of my life,\" he says. \"I lived in the Lower East Side, which was crowded with Chinese, Ukrainian and Jewish communities and Puerto Rican drag queens. I took class every day with Merce [Cunningham], who was the most brilliant teacher I'd ever studied with. And I went to as much dance as I could. I soaked it all up.\"</p> <p>Alston returned to London in 1977, and began to settle down. \"I've never had a strategy,\" he says. Shortly after founding his own small troupe, he was invited to choreograph a work for Ballet Rambert. He became the company's resident choreographer, and then, in 1986, its artistic director. In 1994, he ended up back at the Place Theatre, the home of his original school and company, where he formed a replacement ensemble for the London Contemporary Dance Theatre, which he has been directing and choreographing ever since. \"I never planned for any of this to happen,\" Alston says, with an expression of slightly bemused gratitude. \"Maybe there is a larger pattern here.\"</p> <p>The pattern lies in Alston's enthusiasm for his art. He remembers being a teenager at village barn dances, \"learning complicated reels very quickly and wanting to organise everybody\". Seeing his first ballet was a revelation. \"It was the Royal Ballet Touring Company and I queued up to see every performance. This was 1965 and Margot Fonteyn was dancing with Rudolf Nureyev. Margot especially knocked me for six. Then at the end of the week I saw Ashton's Fille Mal Gard\u00e9e and I thought, 'This is wonderful. I would love to make something like this.' I took my parents on the last night and said to them, 'This is what I want to do.'\"</p> <p>Alston was due to start at art college. His mother \"went crazy\", but he stood firm. He enrolled in ballet and modern dance classes, and went to see every company that came to London. Those years, in which he studied art, listened to music and learned about different kinds of dance, made Alston the choreographer he is today.</p> <p>What has marked Alston out from many of his peers is his indifference to changing fashions in dance. He has seen successive generations of choreographers pioneering different trends, from strident, issue-driven dance theatre to experiments with digital technology. At times Alston, the purist, admits he has felt \"like a dinosaur\" among them. But he also believes that it is his commitment to \"digging deeper and deeper into the core of dance\" that has made him a survivor. \"I've never wanted to make loud statements,\" he says.\"What I believe in is the amazing power and complexity of the human body in steps, in rhythm and music. And that doesn't change.\" </p> <p>He doesn't fear the prospect of diminishing energy. \"I've always loved the endgame scenario - the late quartets of Shostakovich, the late plays of Shakespeare and of course the work that Merce is still making at 89. If I thought I had made my best piece, I would stop. But I don't think I have.\" </p> <p>\u2022 The <strong>Richard Alston Dance Company</strong> perform 40/60 at the Northcott theatre, Exeter, today and tomorrow, then touring.

  "<p>Some weeks ago, when we were up in the Mendips, west of Frome, searching for relics of a Victorian canal, we came by chance to one of those spots that open up a view so striking that you simply stop and stare. So now we went back, up to the top of Holcombe, past the terraces of one-time coal-miners' cottages that line the long climb of the main street, and out towards open fields where a path signed \"old church only\" leads past stone barns and through the yard of Moore's Farm, leased to William Moore in 1674. </p> <p>And there was the view. You would need a wide-angle lens to take in the whole sweep of it, from high ground to the left, across the field straight ahead, and round to where it opens out on the right into a broad plain that spreads into Wiltshire. But it is the winding stone track ahead of you that attracts the eye and leads it down across the empty field to the small church that stands in the corner. Autumn sun and shade sharpened its edges and angles so that the square tower stood out as a focal point. The background was dark, shadowy woods, and above the tree line, some distance off at Stratton-on-the-Fosse, the top of Downside Abbey's tower, tall and gothic, completed the composition. </p> <p>Beside the low stone wall of the graveyard, a parson, evidently out for his Sunday afternoon walk, motioned to the surrounding empty spaces and said this was the site of a plague village, destroyed like many others by the black death. St Andrew's Church, with its zig-zag Norman arch over the porch, was all that was left. Some say that the new coal-mining industry combined with plague to destroy the community. Our way home took us through another ancient village, Doulting, where St Aldhelm died in 709. But Doulting survived the plague, and its quarrying industry (soft, workable Doulting stone built much of Wells Cathedral and Glastonbury Abbey) survives into the present time.</p>",
  "<p>More than one in two state schools are breaching admissions laws, according to the schools adjudicator, who yesterday revealed a widespread failure to properly implement laws designed to prevent the covert selection of pupils.</p> <p>Sir Philip Hunter insisted that the breaches were being urgently corrected, but said it was \"too late\" for parents who felt their child unfairly lost a place this year.</p> <p>Hunter employed a team of barristers to review compliance in every local authority in England and in 3,000 faith schools on the orders of the schools secretary, Ed Balls, earlier this year.</p> <p>The review found widespread technical failures to communicate the rules to parents, and the potential to discriminate against children in care. One in five faith schools were asking improper questions on application forms, including about parents' jobs.</p> <p>However, the adjudicator cleared schools of asking for cash as a condition of entry, a problem highlighted by Balls in April after that was found to be the case in a handful of Jewish schools in Barnet, north London.</p> <p>Hunter acknowledged that the majority of individual breaches of the code were by faith schools. He said he did not believe that schools broke the law on purpose, but some pupils would have unfairly lost a place this year. Asked what recourse parents had, he said: \"It's too late.\"</p> <p>He said it was in schools' interests to meet the code to avoid litigation from angry parents. \"What this exercise was about was protecting schools from challenges from parents and others, many of which now involve the use of lawyers. What we're saying is, if you get your admissions arrangements in place and make them lawyer-proof, then it will help you in the long run,\" he said.</p> <p>The findings were published alongside the Office of the School Adjudicator's annual report. It found an unprecedented doubling of the number of official complaints against schools' admissions rules, including a significant rise in complaints from parents challenging procedures.</p> <p>Hunter said: \"There's no possibility ever of all parents getting their first choice, even if every school everywhere in the world was absolutely perfect. Even if every school had 100% exam results and test results, good Ofsted reports, and was in beautiful buildings, some schools would still be more popular than others.\"</p> <p>However, Balls said yesterday that parents should have a choice in their child's education. \"We have got a tough code and it's really important the law is properly applied in every school. Every parent should have the right to send their child to the school of their choice - if they can get in on fair criteria.</p> <p>\"It should not be about schools choosing which parent or which children to have. The code is clear for schools to follow and the adjudicator will make sure it's properly implemented in every community in our country. It needs to be every school abiding by the law, so that every parent has a fair choice.\"</p> <p>Hunter issued a series of recommendations to ministers suggesting national guidelines on the code and on what faith schools can ask on their supplementary application forms.</p> <p>The report also criticises the process by which parents can appeal, saying it lacks independence from the school. One school even held appeals in the headteacher's study. Hunter said schools were also being forced by law to hear appeals for infants' places when separate regulations meant they could not expand numbers when the appeal was successful.</p>",

  "<p>The news that inflation reached 5% in September could not have come at a worse time for universities already licking their wounds after investing more than \u00a377m in collapsed Icelandic banks. As the final instalment of a three-year pay deal, universities had committed to increase pay from October by the same amount as the retail price index for September 2008 or 2.5%, whichever was greater. With RPI at 5%, this means higher education institutions are facing much higher than expected wage bills. The latest rise means pay will have increased by 15% since 2006.</p> <p>Some universities are already feeling the pinch. \"The magnitude of the October pay increase will stretch the finances of all higher education institutions and some may be forced to phase or defer payment,\" says Jocelyn Prudence, chief executive of the Universities and Colleges Employers Association (Ucea). \"However, the rise will still be applied, albeit in stages, prior to August 2009. Institutions will need to make difficult adjustments to their planned budgets to meet these new costs and minimise job losses.\"</p> <p>Universities can defer the pay rise by up to 11 months if they are in \"serious financial difficulty\". Already Bolton and Swansea universities have said they will defer October's rise. Peter Marsh, deputy vice-chancellor at Bolton University, says the decision is necessary. \"In the interests of job security, we need to be assured that it is both affordable and sustainable, without putting our interests into serious financial difficulty,\" he says. Staff will get 2% now and the rest by September 2009. Swansea, meanwhile, concerned that the rise represents a \"significant departure\" from its salaries budget, will not pay the 5% until it is ratified by the university's finance committee on December 1. In the interim, it will pay 2.5%. </p> <p>Others have yet to decide, and although the Russell Group of universities says its members will honour the pay rise in full, it is concerned. \"The deal agreed in 2006 was already at the limit of affordability for many higher education institutions and this final phase, linked to the extraordinarily high retail price index, will place a considerable strain on already stretched university finances,\" the group says. \"When combined with other financial pressures, this will inevitably impact on future pay and pension negotiations.\" But the University and College Union, which represents academic staff, says the universities have had ample time to budget for the rise. \"I am completely confident that every university employer will have the finances to pay this,\" says the general secretary, Sally Hunt.</p> <p>So far, it seems, the combined financial pressures of pay rises and the recession have had minimal impact on recruitment and retention. A forthcoming survey by Ucea, the Higher Education Funding Council for England (Hefce), Universities UK and GuildHE during August and September 2008 found no significant change in the job market for higher education since the last study in 2005. \"Early indicators from the latest research show that there has been little change in recruitment and retention difficulties for institutions,\" says Prudence. \"Even where recruitment difficulties are present, there appear to be few problems with retention of staff once they are employed.\"</p> <p>However, the recession is likely to exacerbate problems in finding enough academic staff in specialist subjects as fears over job security increase and people look to retrain. The Training and Development Agency for Schools has already seen a sharp rise in inquiries related to teaching, while others are seeking to boost their job prospects with formal professional qualifications in areas such as law, accountancy and business administration, all of which were highlighted in the Ucea survey as major areas of recruitment difficulty.</p> <p><strong>Redundancy fears</strong></p> <p>But many believe the financial downturn is likely to improve retention. Staff in related disciplines may be less likely to leave academia for a career in the City. In other disciplines, however, redundancies are on the cards. Plymouth has announced around 200 job losses and Queen Margaret's, Fife, has said it will make some staff redundant because it cannot afford the 5% pay rise. \"There is certainly some evidence that a number of institutions, if they weren't contemplating redundancies, are contemplating them now,\" says Phil Harding, chairman of the British Universities Finance Directors Group.</p> <p>Some are concerned that the credit crunch could see undergraduate numbers suffer amid concerns about student fees. \"It will be interesting to see how student numbers hold up because of anxieties about debt,\" says Hunt. These fears could be exacerbated, if there were any change to eligibility for grants. And if industry cuts back on research contracts - from which Hefce reported universities earned \u00a32.6bn last year - more job losses may follow.</p>",
  "<p>Giving a presentation is all about sharing your knowledge and enthusiasm - unless you don't know much and don't care. Then it is all about looking as if you do. So the first thing you need to think about in a presentation is presentation. Bear in mind that your audience will decide whether or not you know what you're talking about within the first few seconds (less if they've been in your seminar group all term). You therefore need to adopt an air of authority. Wear something in which you feel confident yet comfortable, smile, think about what you are going to do with your hands, and don't drink so much pre-performance caffeine that you can't coordinate taking notes out of a ring binder.</p> <p>It would be even better if you could dispense with the notes altogether. And don't, whatever you do, try to read them out. There's no surer way to bore your audience. If you feel safer with a prompt, jot down a few sentences on cards, and put the cards in a trouser pocket. Make sure they're in the right order - and make sure you're wearing the right trousers.</p> <p>It is a good idea to start by finding out what topic you are supposed to address, how much time you have, and who will be listening. Knowing your audience is the key to keeping them happy.</p> <p>Sometimes this means giving them a few laughs, but be careful. Although you may have had half of them in hysterics with your risque jokes on open mic night, they may not respond in the same way in a seminar room. Don't over-rehearse and remember that laughing at your own jokes doesn't prove that you're funny.</p> <p>Do maintain eye contact with your audience; it keeps them involved and allows you to check whether or not they've dropped off to sleep. This is not the same as gazing obsessively at the blonde in the front row.</p> <p>If you plan to use computer or audiovisual equipment, read the instruction manual more than 10 minutes before your presentation is due to begin, and check that the equipment is actually there. Resist getting over-excited at the PowerPoint graphics available, and don't try to put too many words on a single slide, or too many slides in a single talk. Use large type, simple colours and lower-case letters, otherwise it looks as though you're shouting. Double-check your spelling and use of apostrophes, and don't block the audience's view - unless you've spotted a spelling howler.</p> <p>Above all, rehearse your presentation as much as possible, ideally in front of a friend who won't giggle.</p> <p>When it comes to questions, it is much better to say that you don't know the answer than to waffle. This is less true if you don't know the answer to any of them.</p>",
  "<p>Nothing creates such political passions as the question of who goes to university. For the right, attempts to increase the proportion from lower socioeconomic backgrounds suggest social engineering and dilution of academic standards. For the left, middle-class dominance of universities - or at least the elite ones, including Oxford, Cambridge and some other members of the 20-strong Russell Group - is an indefensible example of social injustice, passing privilege down the generations. State schools complain that posh universities turn their pupils down because they've got the wrong accents; fee-charging schools complain that their kids are rejected for applicants with inferior qualifications.</p> <p>It is class warfare in its rawest form. As the current term began, it was stirred by Lord (Chris) Patten, chancellor of Oxford and a former Tory minister, who said the university was \"not a social security office\"; John Denham, the universities secretary, replied that Patten was defending social elitism.</p> <p>It is the kind of thing that needs a UN peacekeeping force. That is roughly the role assigned to Professor Sir Martin Harris, head of the Office for Fair Access (Offa). I first met Harris nearly 30 years ago, when he was at Salford University, which had just been hit by severe funding cuts. He struck me then as lean, hungry and very, very angry. Now, at 64, after two university vice-chancellorships, he is thicker set, better fed and much calmer. Some wish he'd be less calm and, as the Americans say, kick a bit of ass. \"His heart is in the right place, but he's not the most incisive individual in the world,\" was the assessment of one recent (non-Russell Group) vice-chancellor. \"He hasn't disturbed the scorers.\"</p> <p>Offa was the price Labour backbenchers extracted for supporting the legislation introducing top-up fees, and was widely known as Oftoff - though, as Harris rather huffily points out, nobody calls it that now. His appointment didn't please either side in the class struggle. The left hoped for somebody more independent than an insider from the academic bureaucracy who was chairman of the committee of vice-chancellors and principals (now Universities UK). The right's view was summed up by Tory MP John Maples, who described Harris as \"a real, old, hoary left-winger\" whom the government had found in \"some intellectual Jurassic Park\".</p> <p>Harris, a Labour election agent in the 1960s, who left the party only when he became vice-chancellor of Essex in 1987 (because the local MPs were Tories, he says), had indeed quoted a senior civil servant who described him as \"resolutely old Labour\". In the same speech, he said \"class underlies almost all the inequalities and unfairnesses in our system\". The Labour party is in his blood, his maternal grandparents being Christian socialists, his father a Welsh socialist. He remains a vehement opponent of the 11-plus and sent his children to Manchester comprehensives. Nobody who knows him doubts his commitment to social justice. </p> <p>So why is there a feeling in some quarters that Offa hasn't been tough enough, that, as a current (again non-Russell Group) vice-chancellor put it, Harris \"has done what was required and nothing else\"? Why do working-class students still account for fewer than 30% of the total, and state school entry to Oxbridge for less than 60%? Why is Oxford likely to miss its target to take 62% from state schools by 2011? Why, although it can impose financial sanctions (or ask the Higher Education Funding Council to do so), has Offa not even issued a final warning to a single university, even though Harris says \"we are in dialogue from time to time\"?</p> <p>Charles Clarke, the education secretary who appointed Harris, says he \"didn't expect dramatic change, but material change over five to seven years\". He wanted somebody trusted within academia, but also committed to widening access to elite universities. \"I didn't look for a campaigner or an advocate,\" Clarke says. \"Rather, I wanted a systems person, somebody who would take a pragmatic rather than a declaratory approach. My impression is that Martin has dealt with the issues of process and procedure. My question - and I'm looking at this from the outside now - is whether this has led to a tick-box approach rather than changing the culture. I think many universities still don't get it. They regard the whole access thing as an imposition by a politically correct government.\"</p> <p>If Harris agrees, he's not letting on. When we meet, I start by quoting another passage from the speech that offended Maples. He had recalled how, from a humble background in Plymouth and a state grammar school, he got to Queen's College, Cambridge, the first member of his family to attend university. \"To be blunt,\" he had said, \"the chance ... would not necessarily be available to a boy or girl of comparable income and from a comparable neighbourhood today.\"<br><strong><br>Improving chances</strong></p> <p>What, at Offa, has he done about it? He doesn't immediately answer but goes back to what he says was his original brief, to ensure top-up fees didn't deter students from impecunious homes. \"The fear that finance alone might discourage the lower income groups has been disproved,\" he says. Government grants and loans, plus bursaries offered by universities from increased fee income, have worked. Harris talks about this at length, implying he saw his role as primarily a defensive one - which, Clarke made clear to me, was not at all how he saw it.</p> <p>Harris continues: \"Now we are left with the much more difficult issue: how do you increase aspiration among families with no experience of higher education? And the issue that has really come to the fore in the last two years is that getting them into university is not good enough. We've got to get them into certain universities, the highly selective ones.\"</p> <p>Harris argues there are many important factors \"not under universities' control\". For example: \"I know an Oxbridge college which spent time and effort trying to recruit in the far north-east. It made six offers, but, in the end, they all went to Durham or Newcastle. Roughly speaking, the further north you go, the more difficult it is to get a young person, no matter how talented, to apply to a university in the south. Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield can pull southerners north, but Exeter can't get applications from Sunderland.\"</p> <p>Another example: a minority of state school pupils in cities attend 11-18 schools. \"The highly selective universities concentrate on subjects such as sciences and modern languages. Look at an 11-16 school in a not particularly favoured area and ask yourself if three sciences or a range of languages are likely to be available.\"</p> <p>This, I suggest to Harris, won't do. Everything depends on what we mean by \"fair access\". Is it fair to compare an applicant who has three Bs at A-level from an inner-city comprehensive with one who has three As from a fee-charging school, having enjoyed home advantages plus intensive school coaching? If the northern working classes shy away from Oxford and Cambridge, is it because they've been told it's fantastically difficult to get in and think these universities are full of toffs? After all, Sutton Trust research showed a third of Oxbridge entrants come from just 100 schools. So perhaps the elite universities should change their definition of \"highly qualified\" and use some kind of quota system - for example, by creating the \"pool of applicants\" from the top 2% or 3% in each school, providing they have B grades at least.</p> <p>Harris listens to all this politely, without quite agreeing or disagreeing. He simply says: \"We are dealing with very complex social factors\", and adds: \"Would it be wise to encourage young people who want to go to a perfectly good local university to go somewhere where they may be less happy and, therefore, do less well? That takes us into talking about the whole nature of British society.\" A quota system, he says, would introduce unfairness in other ways. \"But if you said, should a fixed proportion from each school be motivated to aim for top university entry, then I'm with you.\"</p> <p>When we talk later about Salford, Harris shows he's well aware of what's at stake. He was pro vice-chancellor when, at the height of the early 1980s recession, the Tory government demanded 15% cuts across the university sector. The funding body, then the University Grants Committee (UGC), hardly touched the more established universities, while Salford, with more than 40% cuts, was the most extreme example of what happened to non-traditional, vocational, new universities.</p> <p>\"The cuts,\" says Harris, \"were made in those universities and departments which took people with the weakest A-levels. They were based on input rather than output measures, which was terribly unjust. Some of those who came with weak A-levels did very well. What students achieve at A-level doesn't necessarily tell you what they're going to achieve later.\"</p> <p><strong>Frustrated politician</strong></p> <p>The Salford cuts and the eloquence of Harris's protests were the making of him. He had originally aimed for a political career and, at Cambridge, became Labour club chairman with the intention of building the right base. But marriage and parenthood came early, and he decided politics was incompatible with family life. Having got a first in modern languages, he went instead into university teaching and research, starting with a doctorate in French linguistics and then writing books with titles such as The Evolution of French Syntax. \"So here,\" he says, \"was a frustrated politician and, if you were one of that small minority who actually wanted to go on the faculty board, people would say: yes, please do. There were elections, but I was always unopposed.\"</p> <p>Salford projected him into national academic politics. He was invited to join the UGC because, as Sir Peter Swinnerton-Dyer, then the chairman, recalls, \"we needed a representative of those universities that had been clobbered\". He went on to become vice-chancellor of Essex, then Manchester. His crowning achievement was to prepare the merger of Manchester with its neighbour Umist, creating a northern super-university fit, as some see it, to rival Imperial College in London. He remains in demand for running things and sitting on committees. He has just become president of Clare Hall, Cambridge (which he says doesn't compromise his Offa role because it doesn't have undergraduates), alongside other roles on, for example, the Northwest Development Agency. The Commons public accounts committee, questioning him last month, wondered if this was too many jobs. In fact, the Offa chairmanship is now only two days a week, which was Harris's decision because, he says, \"universities weren't being recalcitrant\".</p> <p>Well, that's his view and perhaps what his critics see as a laidback approach will work. It's too early to tell, but there are some encouraging signs: Cambridge's state school entry was up to 59% from 55% this autumn and total applications for next year are up 12%. Moreover, Denham has now told all universities to give Offa a full account of their admissions policies, though Harris is adamant this doesn't mean - contrary to what Patten thinks - that he, still less the government, will control admissions.</p> <p>\"I haven't worked in the sector for 40 years,\" Harris says, \"without learning that universities have to be persuaded to change their ways. Am I satisfied that those universities that are constantly talked about in the media are making pretty serious efforts with summer schools and so on? Yes, I am. Am I confident they will overcome that complex of social factors we talked about? That is uncertain.\"</p>",
  "<p>Let's take a hypothetical scenario. The Browns, from Norwich, have three sons: Robert, 17, Luke, 18, and Johnny, 19. When Johnny started university last year, the government only allowed him a maintenance grant to help with his rent and living costs if Angela Brown and her husband Steve earned less than \u00a338,045. When Luke started his degree this September, a year later, the upper limit for the grants had shot up to \u00a360,000.</p> <p>Last week it changed again.

He now won't qualify for a maintenance grant, although he's one of six children. \"This means I and many others will face the prospect of working so many hours to earn money to make up for the grant cuts that my degree will suffer,\" he says.</p> <p>And it's by no means a given that a child from a middle-income family will receive financial support from their parents. </p> <p>Jennifer, 18, will not be eligible for a grant now because her parents earn more than the new threshold. But they have told her they won't give her a penny when she starts university next year. \"It's stupid to assume that because someone's parents can help them, they will,\" she says. \"I am expecting to be very, very broke throughout uni.\"</p> <p>Alfie, 18, from Cornwall, says: \"Some students have already sent off university applications and are now worrying about whether they can afford to go or not.\"</p> <p>The University of Leicester's student finance adviser, Julie Boggon, says she often hears from students in middle-income families in financial difficulty.</p> <p>\"They frequently find themselves just outside the funding thresholds that would allow them to receive extra government or university help,\" she says.</p> <p>\"Their parents have their own essential costs to meet, and struggle to assist. When they are in real financial difficulty, we offer short-term loans and approach external agencies, such as charities and trust funds.\" In the current financial climate, more are likely to go to their student finance office cap in hand.</p> <p>Some people's sympathies will be limited: these aren't the poorest students. But this could inadvertently dissuade students from the lowest-income families from applying, says Stephen Sheedy, principal of Queen Mary's college for 16- to 19-year-olds, in Hampshire.</p> <p>\"It's another change, and sends out the message that there is less money to help students get through university,\" he says. \"The poorest students may be psychologically affected by this, even if they aren't financially penalised. The government has to be very careful about how it handles the messages about student financial support.\"</p> <p>\"Each year the system changes,\" says Jane Fitzwalter, student funding manager at Bristol University. \"It adds to the confusion for parents and students. The overall effect is that students aren't clear what they can get.\"</p> <p>Denham has managed to annoy university leaders, too. At the same time as he announced the grant cuts, he delivered a double whammy by revealing that the expected number of university places next year would be reduced. There will be 5,000 fewer places because the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills underestimated the popularity of degree courses and needs to save money.</p> <p>There will still be 10,000 more places than this year. But factor in the boom in students of university age, and teenagers applying to university now for next year are going to face record competition. Oxford and Cambridge universities, which set the earliest deadlines, have already reported a 12% hike in applications this year.</p> <p><strong>Missed targets</strong></p> <p>Dr David Law, pro vice-chancellor of Edge Hill University, says he views this with \"serious concern\". It throws into doubt the government's drive to give \"towards 50%\" of the population a university education, he says.</p> <p>\"The restrictions on growth indicate a clear signal that the 50% participation target is no longer government policy,\" he says. \"With the economy entering recession, the country needs a thriving university sector to ensure high levels of productivity and competitiveness.\"</p> <p>Professor Les Ebdon, vice-chancellor of the University of Bedfordshire, says he is going to have to scale down plans to recruit students from the most under-represented groups in higher education.</p> <p>\"Now would have been the ideal time to expand student numbers,\" he says. \"We are entering a recession and people are being made redundant. It's a marvellous opportunity to retrain the workforce.\"</p> <p>Not everyone is worried. Roderick Smith, director of admissions at the University of Birmingham, says universities at the \"top of the pecking order\" will have no problem filling their places.</p> <p>As for student grant cuts, Smith says that when the government brought in \u00a31,000 tuition fees in 1997 and \u00a33,000 fees in 2006, the number of students slightly fell and then quickly recovered.</p> <p>\"Students aren't that worried by the money,\" he says. But try telling that to the students and their parents under present circumstances.</p>",
  "<p>Picture a primary school in a deprived area of Manchester, where a third of the 450 pupils are considered \"at risk\". Add to that a tragedy involving children from the school, followed by the removal into immigration custody of a nine-year-old boy, at a time when teachers say he was showing signs of recovering from the trauma of his life in the country of his birth.</p> <p>You might imagine such a school to be sombre. From the outside at least, Gorton Mount primary creates that impression - but after a day spent with staff and pupils, it is clear that this is a happy place.</p> <p>Manchester is known as the asbo capital of the UK, and Gorton, where the Channel 4 series Shameless was filmed, has more than its share of problems. Staff say they are as likely to give advice to parents on debt management and nutrition as on academic progress.</p> <p>Carol Powell has been head of Gorton Mount since 2002. In August, when we first spoke, Powell was embroiled in consultations with lawyers and activists, trying to prevent the removal to Iran of a nine-year-old pupil who, along with his mother, brother and sister, had been placed in a detention centre. (The family is now free and the boy is back in class.) Two weeks before, Powell had attended the funeral of a Gorton parent, who had died under a train. The head was also involved in several child protection cases.</p> <p>When Powell took over Gorton Mount, she became the seventh head in six years and the school was in special measures; 66% of pupils are entitled to free school meals. Then, as now, more than 40 languages were spoken and pupil mobility is high. One boy had been to 17 primary schools before arriving at Gorton Mount, because his mother was running away from an abusive partner.</p> <p>Powell oversaw 20 changes of teaching staff in the first two years and now cannot speak highly enough of the team she has around her. Describing them as \"super professionals, inside and outside school\", she says they \"put their own needs on hold in favour of the needs of the children\".</p> <p>According to Hew-ting Yuen, who has taught there for five years: \"All learning starts with the child's emotions. We offer them trust and constant support, and my door is still open to children I taught last year and the year before.\"</p> <p>Steve Williams is a learning mentor. At 42, it is his first job in education. He left school with no qualifications, but says his own experiences (he is African-Caribbean, brought up in a tough, mainly white, area of Manchester) helps him to guide children through similar minefields. He is full of praise for the head, saying she \"orchestrates the ethos of caring that runs throughout the school\".</p> <p>Powell says her team includes every member of staff, including the caretaker and lunchtime organisers. Two of the latter, both local women, have been promoted to learning mentors. One, Dee Malloch, 35, is now studying for a Open University degree and says she is \"learning along with the children\".</p> <p>The other, Sharon Egan, lives on a council estate that borders the school and often acts as a go-between if problems arise with parents. Egan specialises in attendance problems, and tells of visiting the home of one pupil who was not in school. \"The landlord wanted the family out, so he took all the windows out, there was a hole in the bathroom wall and the place was freezing,\" she says.</p> <p>This is where the school can step in. The play therapy room is a pivotal point of Gorton Mount. Two days a week, Christine Taylor, a childcare consultant and therapist, treats children who have suffered trauma. A bright, jumbled room, it is littered with toys and, says Taylor, the child is in \"charge of the play\".</p> <p>Although she does not speak of individual cases, the playroom was crucial in picking up the pieces of a catastrophic episode in the life of Gorton Mount.</p> <p>In April last year, a 12-year-old girl, a former pupil, was shot dead by her 16-year-old brother. The killing was a terrible accident; the boy had found a gun hidden in the family's garden and had been playing with it, close to his sister and eight-year-old twin sisters, when it went off. The twins attended Gorton Mount and, before being imprisoned for three years after pleading guilty to possessing the weapon, the dead girl's mother told the Guardian that the twins had received play therapy at the school and described the staff as \"brilliant\".</p> <p>I suggest to the head that critics might say the emphasis on emotional needs is at the expense of academic achievement. Powell points out that children who lead chaotic lives are usually too anxious to be taught and need an ordered atmosphere before they can start to learn. </p> <p>I joined pupils for lunch in the dining hall. Two eight-year-old boys, Brendan and Connor, were swapping stories about their weekend. Connor who wants to be a mechanic, thinks the school is \"mint\", while Brendan says the teachers are nice and friendly. Asked if she likes school, seven-year-old Kierra declares she \"loves it\". Ten-year-old Kaylum thinks the gardening and piano lessons are the best, and I ask him to name his favourite piece of music. He thinks for a moment. \"Ode to Joy. That's by Beethoven, you know.\"</p>",
  "<p>The billionaire property developer Donald Trump has won permission to build \"the world's greatest golf course\", complete with high-rise timeshare flats and eight-storey hotel, on a rare and ecologically sensitive stretch of dunes overlooking the North Sea.</p> <p>The New York-based businessman said he was \"greatly honoured\" after Scottish ministers in Edinburgh confirmed that his dream of creating one of golf's most northerly resorts had been approved, despite vociferous opposition from environmentalists and many local residents.</p> <p>His most famous opponent, Michael Forbes, the fisherman and quarry worker who earned abuse from Trump last year after refusing repeatedly to sell his home, which is on the land, still intends to stay put. \"They reckon the construction will last 10 years, but I'll never ever sell to that loudmouth bully,\" Forbes said last night.</p> <p>The \u00a31bn coastal resort north of Aberdeen, which covers 2,000 acres (809 hectares), is to have two 18-hole championship courses, four blocks of 950 timeshare flats, 500 \"exclusive\" homes, 36 villas, a golf academy, and housing for 400 staff. There will also be a coast road, named Trump Boulevard.</p> <p>Yesterday's outline planning approval legally binds Trump to agree to environmental checks and controls giving Aberdeenshire council and the Scottish government's environment agency, Scottish Natural Heritage, oversight to ensure the remaining wildlife is protected. </p> <p>Trump will be also required to build a 225-pupil primary school, shops, 98 low-cost houses and 50 starter homes (on land provided free by the council) in return for the 500-home estate, chalets and timeshares that will fund the development.</p> <p>The decision was welcomed by the local constituency MSP, the first minister and leader of the Scottish National party, Alex Salmond, and numerous business and tourism groups which regard it as a boost to the regional economy.</p> <p>Salmond, whose party faces a crucial byelection on Thursday in Glenrothes, Fife, said he had not influenced the decision. \"In tough economic times, substantial investment of this kind is at a premium - 6,000 jobs, including 1,400 which will be local and permanent, is a powerful argument. It is entirely right and proper that the resources of the country are harnessed to boost one of our great industries, and tourism is a great Scottish industry.\"</p> <p>Trump said: \"It will be a tremendous asset and source of pride for both Aberdeenshire and Scotland for many generations ... because of the quality of the land we are given to work with, we will build the greatest golf course in the world.\"</p> <p>Conservationists were furious when ministers agreed to override legal protection for part of the Foveran links, a legally protected system of naturally shifting sand dunes. It is designated a site of special scientific interest under EU legislation - but it is also central to Trump's vision. The plan is for the \"back nine\" holes of the main 18-hole course to be built over about a 10th of the dunes, despite the protests from Trump's own ecologists and Scottish Natural Heritage that this is unnecessarily destructive. Trump has refused to move that section of the course, and overruled his own environmental experts, telling the planning inquiry in June that he didn't do \"half-assed\" - it had to be all or nothing, he told the inspectors. The inspectors ruled that the damage to the dunes was outweighed by the resort's substantial value to the economy.</p> <p>This judgment was challenged by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. \"It appears that the desires of one high-profile overseas developer, who refused to compromise one inch, have been allowed to override the legal protection of this important site,\" said Aedan Smith, RSPB Scotland's head of planning. </p> <p>Martin Ford, the Liberal Democrat councillor whose casting vote against the development forced Scottish ministers to call in the plans, said: \"This is a very, very, bad precedent indeed and sends out a bad message about the protection in Scotland of our natural heritage sites. It appears to me to be a vanity project. I don't think we can claim this is a nationally important development, and it certainly did not need to be built on this site.\"</p> <p>Critics of Trump's proposals, which also breach Aberdeenshire's local development plan with house construction on the green belt, believe ministers have been overawed by the tycoon's reputation. </p> <p>Trump, owner of the Miss World beauty pageants, has been told he can only begin building the high-rise timeshare blocks - dubbed \"the Benidorms\" by angry residents - in stages, after some of the affordable homes are finished. He must also ensure, under Scotland's strict right to roam laws - rules he was unaware of until questioned by the Ramblers Association at the planning inquiry - that visitors still have unimpeded access to the dunes.</p> <h2>'I'll never, ever sell to him'</h2> <p>It is the ramshackle eyesore standing in the way of Donald Trump's great dream: a 23-acre spread of rambling farm buildings and rusting tractors sitting beside the future site of the world's greatest golf course. But despite offers as high as \u00a3450,000 from Trump for their home at Mill of Menie, and now the threat of living in a \u00a31bn construction site, Michael Forbes and his wife Sheila are refusing to sell. </p> <p>\"They reckon the construction will last 10 years, but I'll never, ever sell to that loudmouth bully,\" Forbes said last night. </p> <p>\"As I said before, I would rather give my land away to travelling people than sell to Trump, if it comes to that.\"</p> <p>Yesterday's decision by Scottish ministers to approve Trump's resort made him feel \"sick\", he added. Once a Scottish National party voter, he would never be one again. \"I used to be proud to be a Scotsman, but I'm going to take both of my kilts out and burn them after this,\" he said.</p> <p>Forbes, a salmon fisherman and quarryman, shot to global fame last October - echoing the film Local Hero, in which an elderly beachcomber blocks Burt Lancaster's planned refinery - after Trump branded his land \"disgusting\". </p> <p>Trump claimed Forbes's land was in \"total disrepair ... Rusty tractors, rusty oil cans - I actually asked him, 'Are you doing this on purpose to try and make it look bad, so I have to pay some more money?'\"</p> <p>Forbes said Trump would just have to build around him now. \"His biggest mistake was having a rant about me and calling me names on the TV,\" he said.</p>"
