  "<p>Chris White is a nice guy and a fine referee, which is why I hope I can talk about one of his recent games without anyone taking offence. He's respected. As a former player and official with more than 40 internationals behind him, he has a good understanding of the game and what players are trying to do, legally or illegally.</p> <p>His inclination is to be sympathetic and his reputation is that of a referee who lets games flow where possible.</p> <p>Last week, however, he whistled 35 times in one match - Northampton v Wasps. As close as makes no difference, that's one stoppage every two minutes, whereas last season he would probably have blown up about 19 times.</p> <p>About the same time, two other respected rugby men - the coaches Dean Richards of Harlequins and Dean Ryan of Gloucester - were getting stuck into each other at Kingsholm. Richards - Harlequins just having lost their unbeaten record - cried foul suggesting that Ryan had leaned on the referee <br>Rob Debney at half-time to such an extent that Gloucester - well behind on penalty count as well as the scoreboard - played the second 40 minutes without being penalised.</p> <p>Ryan denied haranguing the referee, insisting that he was merely seeking clarity around the tackle and ruck areas, and Richards' insistence that he'd given up talking to referees, because it was now forbidden, came unstuck when Debney said he'd been spoken to by both coaches during his walk from the pitch to the changing room. Both, said Debney, were polite but that's not the point. Referees and touch judges should be left alone. But then again, I can understand why such things happen.</p> <p>It's a cliche to say that you don't notice good referees, but it's true. In the past, guys like Chris White have been at the heart of good games without outwardly appearing to influence them. Now they don't get the chance of blending into the background. Like it or lump it, the referee too often becomes the focus of the game because the rule makers have taken away the licence to interpret the rules.</p> <p>Alongside the introduction of the 13 'experimental laws' came the 'protocols' which replaced interpretation with instruction. These have been reinforced with two- or three-hour conference calls instructing referees what they must do.</p> <p>The result: 35 penalties in one match. I sense that's not the way most referees want it to be and have a feeling that we are shooting ourselves in the foot. By common consent, the Guinness Premiership appeared to have got it right last season and crowd figures reflected this.</p> <p>I also had a lot of good feedback, the most satisfying from rugby league friends who liked what union was doing and said so. This season, with so much kicking, so much stop-start and lack of continuity, I don't know.</p> <p>Part of what appealed to those league guys was the pressure that built with the phases of play. Now, with referees so hot on the whistle, repeatedly taking the ball into contact has become a big risk - too big a risk when it comes to running the ball out of defence. It's easier to use the boot, play aerial ping-pong if you like, move up the field, wait for mistakes or only attack from well within opposition territory.</p> <p>What that means to potential converts to union I'm still to find out, but some coaches already detect a fall in attendances.</p> <p>It may be that fans are short of money like everyone else, but any dip in gates will obviously be part of the agenda when the new laws and their workings, are reviewed by club coaches in a couple of weeks. </p> <p>However, in the gloom there is a flicker of light. Alarmed at having to chop and change ahead of the Lions' tour next year, South Africa want to drop those Experimental Law Variations not being implemented here which make most offences punishable by free kicks rather than penalties while punishing the side that takes the ball into a ruck or maul but then fails to clear it.</p> <p>Understandably, players, fans and even referees are said to be confused at having to switch for Tests against northern hemisphere sides.</p> <p>These laws have been used in the Tri-Nations and Super 14, with Australia and New Zealand pushing for them to be part of the global game, but with South Africa wanting to rejoin the rest of the rugby-playing world it seems the worst excesses of change will go away and that northern hemisphere rugby - and referees - will be spared further.</p>",
  "<p>West Ham United are facing a fresh legal challenge over the Carlos Tevez affair as up to a dozen players relegated with Sheffield United in 2007 consider suing the London club for loss of earnings.</p> <p>At least 10 players, including the captain Chris Morgan, have sought legal advice since an independent tribunal ruled in favour of Sheffield United's claim that Tevez should not have been allowed to play such an influential role in West Ham's escape from relegation last year. The Bramall Lane club have submitted a claim for \u00a330m in loss of revenue, and players directly involved in demotion to the Championship hope to follow suit with a separate action.</p> <p>Sheffield United's players would have been entitled to a substantial bonus for keeping the club in the Premier League in the 2006-07 season and, in line with many contracts, some suffered pay cuts of between 30% and 50% when they were relegated. The affected players, through the Manchester-based sports law specialists IPS Law, are seeking to recoup those losses from West Ham.</p> <p>Given the various cuts to bonuses and pay negotiated in the individual contracts it is not known what the total claim against West Ham from the players would be, but it would be a significant addition to the fine of up to \u00a330m that the Hammers will have to pay Sheffield United. If the players go ahead West Ham will have to go to arbitration once again. Paul Fletcher, of IPS Law, said: \"All clubs, players and agents are governed by the rules of the Football Association and, in the event of any dispute between these parties, the appropriate forum is for the aggrieved party to bring a claim under rule K of the FA rules. This leads to arbitration proceedings and would be heard in front of a panel of one or three experienced arbitrators.\"</p> <p>West Ham intend to go to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in an attempt to overturn the latest ruling over the Tevez affair but their hopes of success appeared to be dashed yesterday when Matthieu Reeb, the court's secretary general, said it would not hear a case referred by only one party in this dispute because Football Association rules officially preclude an appeal to CAS. \"If there is nothing in the rules, it is mandatory that both parties agree in writing to go to the CAS,\" he said. West Ham are expected to put their case regardless.</p>",
  "<p>This British piano virtuoso runs a sublime, somewhat Brad Mehldau-inspired trio - but he is a fearsome unaccompanied player, too. These two albums of contrapuntal improvisations may bring Keith Jarrett's K\u00f6ln Concert to mind. However, devotees of classical piano may be drawn by Law's elegiac and flawlessly stroked slow explorations of chord voicings. He doesn't hide the years of detailed preparation that have gone into his music, so you don't get Mehldau's deceptively lazy, slow-burn restraint, or a loose deployment of the left-hand ostinatos that Law tends to keep remorselessly tight. But the Englishman can still be light and playful - as on the rocking Zero-G, which suggests early, hard-swinging Abdullah Ibrahim. The Last Dance gently explores twangy prepared-piano; Fair Weather Friend features a boogie feel, Monkish chordal jolts and swing-style trills; and the three-part Little Suite is a lovely display of Law's classically immaculate sense of form and contrast. There is little to choose between the albums, though volume two might just clinch it for variety.<br></p>",
  "<p>Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi is no stranger to public scrutiny. The Sunni Muslim preacher is the star of his own highly popular show on al-Jazeera TV, which is watched by millions for his advice on sharia law. But he may have miscalculated when he warned recently that \"heretical\" Shia Muslims were \"invading\" Sunni countries.</p> <p>The row raging in Arabic newspapers and on websites shows that Qaradawi touched a very raw nerve, triggering angry responses from senior Shia clergy in Iran and Lebanon \u2014 and warnings that this divisive controversy will only benefit the enemies of the Muslim \"ummah\" or nation.</p> <p>Intriguingly, at the same time, anonymous computer hackers calling themselves \"group XP\" \u2014 apparently Sunnis based in the United Arab Emirates \u2014 have been defacing and blocking the website of Iraq's grand ayatollah, Ali Sistani of Najaf, the Shia world's leading religious authority, as well as many other Shia sites. One Iranian website even linked this action to Qaradawi's \"smears\", describing him as \"an extremist of Egyptian origin\". Shia lawyers have filed a lawsuit against him and demanded his expulsion from Qatar, where he now lives.</p> <p>Tensions between Sunnis - who make up 85% of all Muslims - and Shias date back to the early days of Islam. The two communities have long diverged over prayer, practice and some key aspects of belief. In recent years, and especially since Ayatollah Khomeini took power in Iran in1979, their differences have taken on a highly political edge, pitting Persians against Arabs and the western-backed, conservative Sunni regimes against anti-American and Shia Iran. Sectarian killings in post-Saddam, Shia-dominated Iraq and Iran's backing for the Lebanese Shia movement Hizbullah have both been sources of bitter discord. Arab Gulf states worry about Iran's nuclear ambitions, regional influence and \"sleeper cells\". The Shia minority in Saudi Arabia's Eastern Province suffers discrimination, as does the Shia majority in Sunni-ruled Bahrain.</p> <p>King Abdullah of Jordan caught the anxious mood and made waves in 2004 when he complained of the emergence of a \"Shia crescent\" stretching from Beirut to Tehran and cutting through the Sunni-dominated Middle East. The Palestinian Islamists of Hamas are supported by Iran and its only Arab ally, Syria. Their rivals in the Palestinian Authority are backed by the Sunnis, the west and Israel.</p> <p>That is the background to what one commentator has called \"a byzantine debate between the public and men of religion\".</p> <p>The sharpest response to Qaradawi came from Grand Ayatollah Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, Lebanon's leading religious scholar, who openly accused the Egyptian-born cleric of inciting \"fitna\" \u2014 sedition or internal strife \u2014 as bad as it gets in this kind of discourse. Iran's Ayatollah Mohammad Ali Tashkiri pitched in with a similar counter-blast.</p> <p>The row began earlier this month when Qaradawi gave an outspoken interview to an Egyptian newspaper. \"Shia are Muslims but they are heretics and their danger comes from their attempt to invade Sunni society,\" he told al-Masri al-Yom. \"They are able to do that because of their billions [of dollars] and trained cadres of Shia proselytising in Sunni countries.\"</p> <p>There was some surprise since he had previously spoken of the need to bridge differences between the two communities. Still, observers suggested that Qaradawi did have a point about an increase in conversions to Shi'ism in his native land \u2014 though absolute numbers are small. And Qaradawi, who prizes his independence (and as such declined to lead Egypt's powerful Muslim Brotherhood), is free to speak out in a way that is not possible for Cairo's al-Azhar university, the fount of contemporary Sunni thinking, and the state religious establishment.</p> <p>Qaradawi himself has sounded baffled by the row, insisting that there is nothing new or unusual about his objection to Shia practices \u2014 such as the way they mark the anniversary of the martyrdom of Hussein, the grandson of the prophet Muhammad, as well as the infallibility of the imams. \"All the Sunni scholars condemn such heresies,\" he retorted. \"I have always been against extremists everywhere. In all my sermons, books and studies I was always calling on Muslims to seek a moderate line and be united irrespective of the school of thought they embrace. As long as a Muslim bears witness that there is no God but Allah and Muhammad is the prophet of Allah, then he is a Muslim.\"</p> <p>But there has been criticism from the Sunni heartlands too. Tariq al-Homayed, the editor of the Saudi-owned Sharq al-Awsat newspaper, warned that Qaradawi and the Iranians were playing with \"a ball of sectarian and political fire\". This, he also pointed out, was the cleric \u2014 controversially embraced by Ken Livingstone, the former mayor of London \u2014 who had sanctioned the continuation of suicide bombings by (Sunni) Palestinians fighting Israel. \"We told him back then, who can guarantee that we won't see terrorist attacks of that kind on our soil, too? And indeed, that is what happened.\"</p> <p>Another commentator, Abdul Rahman al-Rashed of al-Arabiyya television, was even more blunt in defining what this furious spat is really all about. \"Despite what is said and done, the conflict is basically political not religious,\" he wrote. \"In reality, there is no Shia-Sunni problem; there are only differences between governments.\"</p>",
  "<p>The design of the UK's new identity card - to be issued from November, initially to foreign nationals - was revealed by the home secretary yesterday.</p> <p>Brandishing an example of the baby pink and pale blue polycarbonate document, Jacqui Smith promised it would combat identity theft, help prevent illegal immigration and enable people to prove their identity more easily.</p> <p>More than 50,000 cards are expected to be handed out to foreign nationals from outside Europe between November and March as they extend their visas and register marriages or civil partnerships. </p> <p>From next year ID cards will be given first to those in security-sensitive roles and by 2010 the aim will be to encourage young people to enrol. They will not be compulsory for the general population.</p> <p>The size of a credit card, each ID card bears a digital image of the holder, their name, the place and date of the card's issue, a signature and a unique identity number. For foreign nationals there is also a \"type of permit\" section showing the person's visa category as well as a \"valid until\" date showing how long the holder has permission to stay in the UK.</p> <p>On the reverse, the card carries an electronic chip recording biometric details including fingerprints. The holder's gender, date and place of birth and nationality are recorded above a section entitled Remarks that lists entitlements.</p> <p>One embedded background symbol is a royal crest, rather than the union flag; the other is a bull meant to depict the form the Greek god Zeus took when he abducted Europa - a nod to the EU. </p> <p>There are numerous security features, incorporating raised numbers, optically variable ink which changes colour as the cards is tilted and a raised plant stem from which the UK's national flowers - rose, thistle, daffodil and shamrock - grow. The final design of the ID card for UK citizens will be broadly similar but is likely to be in a different colour, may not have the EU bull motif and will dispense with several of the information categories specific to foreign nationals.</p> <p>Explaining the absence of the union flag, Smith said that no other ID card in the EU carried the design of a national flag. She did not expect that airport workers would refuse to accept ID cards and therefore lose their jobs. </p> <p>David Davis, the former shadow home secretary who resigned over what he alleged was the creation of a \"database state\", said: \"It is typical of this government to kickstart their misguided and intrusive ID scheme with students and foreigners - those who have no choice but to accept the cards - and it marks the start of the introduction of compulsory ID cards for all by stealth.\"</p> <p>Chris Huhne, the Lib Dem home affairs spokesman, said ID cards would \"prove to be a laminated poll tax\".</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337991444\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2008/09/25/ID-CARD_2609-.gif\" alt=\"ID-CARD_2609-.gif\" width=\"471\" height=\"695\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>",
  "<p>They showed us the American high school was a hotbed of class war and identity crisis; they allowed teenagers to be articulate and sensitive on screen; they introduced us to the Brat Pack ... but the John Hughes high-school movies weren't all bad. With the six teen films he released between 1984 and 1987, John Hughes stunned Hollywood by demonstrating that the film industry's most despised genre could spawn its own auteur. The titles are a roll-call of surging hormones and frustrated adolescence: Sixteen Candles, The Breakfast Club, Weird Science, Pretty in Pink, Ferris Bueller's Day Off and Some Kind of Wonderful. Hughes wrote all of them, but for two (Pink and Wonderful) handed over the director's reins to Howard Deutch. </p> <p>By the late 1980s, Hughes had lost interest in teens, moving back down the age range with Home Alone and Baby's Day Out. Nevertheless, his high school movies all remain classics of their kind, riven with codes, tics and motifs that distinguish them from lesser works. Here's a short guide:</p> <p><strong>Check the hair</strong></p> <p>High-school hunk Jake Ryan is gawking at classmate Samantha Baker in Sixteen Candles: \"There's somethin' about her,\" he mumbles. Preppie rich kid Blane McDonagh is discussing hard-up student Andie Walsh in Pretty in Pink: \"You really don't think she's got something?\" he asks. Just what is it that Sam and Andie have? How come a pair of high-status alpha males fixate on a way-below-their-league Molly Ringwald? It's the hair. Ringwald was the first authentic red-headed Hollywood female star since the Technicolor era. It finessed that air of awkward vulnerability she specialised in, and ensured she stood out from the crowd without any brassy tactics. Any doubts over where Hughes stood on the subject of red hair should be demolished by taking a look at Some Kind of Wonderful: Hughes has switched the gender of his romantic lead and, yes, it was the scarlet-bonced Eric Stoltz who got the role.</p> <p><strong>Pump up the volume</strong></p> <p>Nothing sets out Hughes' intentions more explicitly than the quote that flashes up on the screen as The Breakfast Club begins: \"... and these children that you spit on/ as they try to change their worlds are/ immune to your consultations./ They're quite aware of what they're going through.\" It's from David Bowie's Changes, and treating Bowie's cryptic utterances as if they're Shakespeare or Aristotle demonstrates the seriousness with which Hughes takes his teen characters. He made the largely British new-wave music of the 70s and 80s an essential component of his dramatic art. Pretty in Pink is named after the Psychedelic Furs song that became a hit when it was featured in the movie, and Hughes pretty much transformed the career of Simple Minds by making Don't You (Forget About Me) the film's main theme. Hughes also recognised the value of the still-novel MTV channel, where music promos acted as thinly disguised movie trailers: when they hear Pretty in Pink, for example, a generation of thirtysomethings imagines not gaunt Psychedelic Furs singer Richard Butler, but the fresh-faced Ringwald. His final great musical coup was putting Yello's Oh Yeah over the car scenes in Ferris. He was the first to get hold of it, and it's remained the gold-standard for expressing consumerist cupidity ever since.</p> <p><strong>Where are mom and dad?</strong></p> <p>Everyone knows Hughes' greatest line, from The Breakfast Club: \"When you grow up, your heart dies.\" But Hughes didn't just despise parents; he did his utmost to abolish their purpose. In Sixteen Candles, Sam Baker's mum and dad barely notice she exists, let alone remember her birthday. The only authority figure we even glimpse in The Breakfast Club is the crypto-fascist head teacher Paul Gleason. Ferris Bueller's parents are credulous fools, present only to be the butt of Ferris's gift for whip-smart deception. In Pretty in Pink, Andie's dad is around for significant chunks of running time, but he's more childlike than his daughter - a vacuum as much as a presence. And when Hughes left the teen genre, he had his biggest hit with a movie whose entire subject was the absence of parents: Home Alone. </p> <p><strong>My kind of town</strong></p> <p>The Hughes movies gain their special flavour from their location: Hughes is the laureate of Chicago suburbia, specifically the township of Northbrook, Illinois, where he grew up. Northbrook was fictionalised as Shermer in The Breakfast Club and Weird Science, and the films were shot largely in neighbouring suburbs. And, unlikely as it may seem, Ferris Bueller's Day Off (above) is the most Chicago movie since Little Caesar. Hughes's boosting of Chicago now looks like a symbolic act: neither east nor west, it's an uninflected canvas against which the primal emotions of his teens can play out. Other 80s Brat-Pack movies took their cue from him: Class, About Last Night... and Risky Business were all set in the same geographical area. And in later years, John Cusack, a Hughes protege and a native of yet another Chicago suburb, Evanston, would use his clout to have High Fidelity relocated to the city.</p> <p><strong>Three's not a crowd</strong></p> <p>Hughes loved a triangle. Structurally speaking, that is: three-way love triangles dominate his scripts. In Sixteen Candles, Samantha yearns after Jake but is hassled by Ted. Pretty in Pink replicates that more gently: Andie is fixated on Blane, but has to deal gently with Duckie's adoration. And, perhaps sensing his difficulties over the ending of Pretty in Pink (Hughes initially didn't want Andie to get together with the snooty Blane, but realised the momentum was unstoppable), he simply reversed the gender equation in Some Kind of Wonderful (above). Eric Stoltz's Keith is the Ringwald figure, caught between the Duckie-ish Watts and the Blane-esque Amanda. This time, though, Hughes has his favoured pair walking off into the sunset together.</p>",
  "<p>In your report on government plans to amend legislation governing the succession to the throne (End of the Anglican crown - 300 year bar to be lifted, September 25) you suggest that this would require \"the consent of member nations of the Commonwealth\". This is slightly misleading. There is general agreement that it would only be necessary to obtain the consent of the 15 other \"Commonwealth realms\" - members that retain the Queen as their head of state. Nevertheless, the requirements for unanimity across the Commonwealth realms, and for any changes to be legislated for in each of these states, are significant obstacles to reform.</p> <p>The passage of such legislation is likely to provide a focus for broader debates about the future of a largely absentee monarchy. It is also bound to revive interest in the quite separate issue of whether it is any longer appropriate for the British monarch to be \"head of the Commonwealth\". In previous decades British policymakers have shied away from this sort of reform precisely because it was likely to raise more profound questions about the whole bizarre system. Indeed, one wonders whether, on further consideration, they might once again simply decide to \"let sleeping dogs lie\".<br><strong>Philip Murphy</strong><br>Professor of British and Commonwealth history, <br>University of Reading </p> <p>The new constitutional reform plans drafted for Gordon Brown by Chris Bryant MP are very worthy as far as they go. In principle no one should be discriminated against on a basis of gender or faith, including over succession to the throne. But there is a myriad of more pressing problems with the way the UK is governed, affecting many more people, which need urgently to be addressed. Chris Bryant appears to have hit on one of them at least: the privy council. It seems the role of the council in arbitrating on devolution issues is likely to be focused upon, certainly an area ripe for reform. But the council is also an executive and law-making organ through which much important governance, both domestically and elsewhere, is conducted, usually subject to little or no democratic scrutiny. </p> <p>If Gordon Brown is to show he is serious about constitutional renewal in a prospective fourth term, he must pledge himself to placing the privy council as a whole and the royal prerogative powers associated on a statutory basis, accountable to parliament, within the framework of a fully codified UK constitution.<br><strong>Dr Andrew Blick</strong><br>Research officer, Democratic Audit, <br>University of Essex </p> <p>While it is \"nice\" that Catholics or women could become monarchs, the retention of the primogeniture rule is just silly. Common sense dictates that the eldest child is not necessarily better than the others, and English royal history certainly suggests this is the case. Even more silly is the belief that one family is somehow royal and better and so is the nominal head of the country. Far better to have a head of state elected by the people for a fixed term - and ejectable after that. Perhaps the Labour party may wish to look at the more radical idea of a republic for the future if it wishes to generate real change rather than puddling at the constitutional edges of relevance.<br><strong>Philip Durham</strong><br>Surrey Hills, Victoria, <br>Australia </p> <p>Advocates of changes to the succession of the crown like Geoffrey Robertson show their motivation, and it is not tenderness for Roman Catholics. They do not wish to revive the monarchy for a new generation; they hope to unpick the institution by degrees. An honest full-frontal attack would be vastly unpopular, so they are reduced to republicanism by stealth.<br><strong>Richard Cross</strong><br>London </p> <p>I don't care which member of that bloody family ends up as our monarch - still less about their gender or religion. The biggest human rights violation here is that we do not have the right to vote for our own choice as our head of state.<br><strong>Peter Evans</strong><br>Walton-on-Thames, Surrey </p> <p>I hope that this is not the start of a Blairite plot to make him king.<br><strong>Jim Waight</strong><br>Hertford</p>",
  "<p>Robert Mugabe cast himself into the glare of media attention at the UN general assembly in New York yesterday, taking the opportunity to lash out at Britain and America, which he accused of inflicting untold suffering on the people of Zimbabwe.</p> <p>The president of Zimbabwe was centre stage at the UN building when his turn came round to deliberate before the assembly about the state of the world through his eyes. He did not refer to the elections and the violence his regime unleashed against the opposition led by Morgan Tsvangirai until their power-sharing deal, choosing instead to focus on the food crisis which he blamed on western sanctions.</p> <p>\"Those who falsely accuse us of these violations are themselves international perpetrators of genocide, acts of aggression and mass destruction,\" he said.</p> <p>He appealed to the assembly floor, which was notable for the absence of any US delegation, to \"apply pressure for the immediate removal of these sanctions by Britain, the United States and their allies, which have brought untold suffering to our people\".</p> <p>Mugabe also blamed global warming for the widespread scarcity of food in his country. Droughts and floods over the past seven years had disrupted the food supply, he said, implicitly rejecting the widespread view that it stems from the economic disruption that followed his state seizure of large farms owned by whites, and the crippling inflation rate of at least 11m% and rising.</p> <p>In an interview with Associated Press in advance of his UN address, Mugabe further taunted the British and US governments. \"They are waiting for a day when this man, this evil man, called Robert Mugabe is no longer in control. And I don't know when that day is coming.\"</p> <p>He said he had no thoughts of resigning. Nor \"any thought of dying\".</p>",
  "<p>The government is to propose changing planning law to disperse student populations and end the \"studentification\" of university towns.</p> <p>The housing and planning minister, Caroline Flint, will today publish a report that suggests ways to reduce the clustering of student houses in one area which then empties during student holidays. The ideas are likely to be put to parliament in a housing green paper due for publication later this year.</p> <p>The recent growth of the UK's student population to almost 2.5 million has led to residents finding themselves priced out of the low-cost housing market and schools and churches closing through under-use. </p> <p>In Belfast, students from Queen's University live within a mile of campus and make up more than half of all households in the area. </p> <p>Flint will say: \"It is not acceptable that current rental practices allow unplanned student enclaves to evolve to such an extent that local communities are left living as ghost towns following the summer student exodus. Today's report has identified a series of proven steps councils and universities can take to reduce the dramatic effects of 'studentification', where houses of multiple occupation (HMOs) cluster too closely together.\"</p> <p>The government will propose making planning laws stricter, enabling councils to define an HMO as \"any dwelling of three or more people from two or more households\" and determine their frequency in any area, something that has been done in Northern Ireland. </p> <p>Wes Streeting, president of the National Union of Students, said he was alarmed at the prospect of students being displaced in the middle of a housing crisis. He said: \"We are also worried that added bureaucracy will discourage landlords from the HMO market.\"</p>",
  "<p>Glenda Hoffman has an answer for the thieves, should they choose to return to her home in Desert Hot Springs, California. \"I have a shotgun right next to the bed and a .22 under my pillow.\"</p> <p>Hoffman was the victim of a theft that one industry professional has dubbed \"the crime of the future\". Another observer has come up with the term \"grand theft solar\" to describe the spate of recent burglaries in sunny California.</p> <p>In May Hoffman lost 16 solar panels from her roof in three separate burglaries, one while she slept below. Happily for Hoffman her insurers have agreed to pay the $95,000 (\u00a348,000) cost of replacing the panels. But as energy prices soar, and solar power takes off - at least in California - so opportunistic thieves have turned to the lucrative, and complicated, business of dismantling solar panels. </p> <p>\"I wouldn't say it's pervasive, but it's going on,\" California Solar Energy Industries Association executive director Sue Kateley told the Valley Times. </p> <p>California is the leader for solar installations, with 33,000 across the state. Unsurprisingly, it is also the market leader for thefts of solar installations, although figures are hard to come by.</p> <p>\"The solar panel thing is pretty new,\" said Contra Costa county sheriff's office spokesman Jimmy Lee. \"We're seeing an increasing number of cases.\" </p> <p>One night in late August, 26 solar panels with a value of $20,000 were stolen from California's first certified organic farm, Star Route Farms in Bolinas, 20 miles up the coast from San Francisco. </p> <p>\"It's probably easier to steal a $20,000 car,\" Rob Erlichman, president of Sunlight Electric, which sold the panels to the farm in 2006, told the Point Reyes Light. \"To steal that many panels you need a truck and you need guys.\"</p> <p>A few miles inland, in Lafayette, a truck and some guys is just what the thieves had. A resident came home during the day to find three men on the roof of his house and five of his solar panels in the back of a rented truck. The men fled, leaving behind the truck and the panels.</p> <p>Ken Martin, who runs a real estate company in Santa Rosa, California, found one day this spring that thieves had removed 58 panels with a value of $75,000 from an office building he owns. His proposed solution is to paint his solar panels bright pink. \"At least if someone comes across them and they're painted, they'll know that's my colour,\" he said.</p> <p>Law enforcement and the solar industry suggest other approaches to crime prevention.</p> <p>Many companies now sell secure fastenings for solar panels, while some police departments are urging solar power users to inscribe their driving licence number on the panels.</p> <p>But some warn that the thieves are too sophisticated to be troubled by such primitive deterrents. Tom McCalmont, who runs Regrid Power in Campbell, close to California's Silicon Valley, said that the sophistication shown by thieves suggests that industry insiders are behind many of the thefts, a suspicion bolstered by supply difficulties with new solar panels.</p> <p>McCalmont has experience of solar panel thefts: his own company lost $30,000-worth of panels to burglars this summer. \"They knew which wires to cut, which not to cut,\" he said. \"This showed a level of expertise that indicated that whoever did it was from the solar industry.\"</p>",
  "<p>Dozens of flights were cancelled and hundreds more delayed at airports across south-east England yesterday after a computer glitch at Britain's main air traffic control centre.</p> <p>More than 10,000 passengers were stranded after at least 88 flights were scrapped at London's main airports, with services at Cardiff International and Manchester also affected. Cancellations and delays are expected to run into this morning at Heathrow following a system failure at the centre in Swanwick, Hampshire.</p> <p>Nats, Britain's biggest air traffic controller, said the system had returned to normal by yesterday evening. It said a computer failure had affected the monitoring of flights when they reach a higher altitude, meaning that no planes could pass across the south-east at more than 24,000 feet. Planes flying below 24,000 feet could continue because they were being handled by a separate system.</p> <p>Nats added that radar screens did not go blank while technicians scrambled to fix the glitch as air traffic controllers increased the distance between flights and entered flight data manually. For a 40-minute period yesterday there were no departures, and a limited number of arrivals, at all airports in south-east England.</p> <p>Heathrow was badly affected as the world's busiest international airport once again demonstrated the fragility of its operations when delays occur. </p> <p>British Airways said it cancelled \"dozens\" of short-haul flights and warned cancellations would run into today because aircraft were parked at the wrong airports. \"We have cancelled short-haul services but they are multiple-frequency so it will enable us to rebook customers on to alternative services.\"</p> <p>Nats is part-owned by a consortium of airlines including BA. One of the biggest investors in Nats, easyJet, was far from amused last night after cancelling 53 flights at Gatwick, Luton and Stansted. \"We apologise to passengers for events that were out of our control and we will be asking, along with other airlines, why this happened on the scale that it did,\" said an easyJet spokesman.</p> <p>EasyJet passengers at Gatwick complained that they were given no information about cancellations. Eamon McGee, a 36-year-old construction consultant from Derry, said passengers were \"queuing around like a big snake\". \"There's a queue of about 100 people waiting to speak to someone,\" he said. \"They've closed the check-in desk, that's not a good sign. There's no one to ask what's happening.\"</p> <p>BAA, the UK's biggest airport owner, said the glitch had resulted in \"a lot of congestion on the airfield at Heathrow\". </p> <p>A spokeswoman for Luton airport said that cancellations were possible but \"this is not a blanket cancellation of all flights\". She added: \"We are suffering delays due to the restrictions placed on flights by Nats.\" Cardiff International said it had cancelled two services, while some flights from Manchester airport were diverted because they could not fly over the south-east.</p> <p>This is not the first time that the \u00a3623m air traffic control centre has caused problems. It was blighted by computer glitches after it opened in 2002, with air traffic controllers at one point being forced to rely on handwritten slips of paper for the call sign and route of each aircraft. </p> <p>The West Drayton centre suffered another failure in June 2004, with Gatwick services particularly badly hit.</p> <p>Swanwick unveiled a \u00a350m system upgrade in March last year, but the run-up to its launch was marred by complaints from some controllers that the new system was difficult to handle.</p>",
  "<p>Sir Victor Blank is clearly pleased with himself. The City grandee with an enviable contact book that spans the worlds of finance, media, politics and show business will soon be at the helm of the biggest high-street bank in Britain - assuming the rescue takeover of mortgage lender HBOS goes as planned.</p> <p>The Lloyds TSB chairman, a fantastic raconteur even in the most ordinary of times, tells the remarkable story that paved the way to the historic deal as if it were a fast-paced thriller. It is a rollcall of the City's great and good, \"aggressive\" share price moves, and the intervention of his friend Gordon Brown.</p> <p>Sitting in his office overlooking St Paul's in the heart of the City, and surrounded by photos of him in various poses with celebrities, sportsmen, politicians and royalty, Blank insists the two sides first talked two years ago but threw in the towel because competition issues would almost certainly have blocked the ambitious deal.</p> <p>Six weeks ago, though, the picture started to change. HBOS shares were being pummelled over repeated concerns about its ability to keep raising funds on the money markets. There were concerns that savers would start to lose confidence in the bank. Blank recalls that Eric Daniels, the understated Lloyds chief executive, and Andy Hornby, the energetic HBOS chief executive, had a quiet drink. \"They came to the conclusion that there was a lot to be said for a deal and that maybe we should push it along,\" said Blank.</p> <p>Blank kept a back seat, letting the executive teams do the negotiating. But behind the scenes Blank was working his contact book. \"I was with a business delegation that went to Israel and Palestine with the prime minister. On the plane back we were talking about the economy, the banking sector and so on, and I put to him that if there was a need for consolidation or a major rescue ... that we couldn't have a bank like Northern Rock that was sitting becalmed for nine months while the competition investigation went on,\" Blank recalls.</p> <p>The PM and his officials were already on alert and shortly afterwards Sir Callum McCarthy, outgoing chairman of the Financial Services Authority, contacted Blank to discuss the same issues. With the tripartite authorities - the FSA, the Treasury and the Bank of England - working in the background, the HBOS and Lloyds TSB staff kept working steadily.</p> <p>Northern Rock, which Lloyds nearly bailed out a year ago, had been nationalised; Bradford &amp; Bingley's rights issue had been under-written by the big six high-street banks, and Alliance &amp; Leicester taken over by Santander, owner of Abbey. \"The next one people were talking about was HBOS,\" said Blank bluntly. </p> <p>Last week the talks were accelerated. HBOS's shares were enduring a steep decline on the stockmarket, after the collapse of the investment bank Lehman Brothers sent shock waves round the world. On Monday night last week, Blank attended a dinner where Brown was also a guest. The PM brought up the subject. \"He said, 'if you think you want to advance on this, we will deal with the competition issues',\" Blank recalls. </p> <p><strong>Assault</strong></p> <p>It was a crucial moment. Daniels was also at the dinner but before either man could take action, Blank's phone rang at 7.30am on Tuesday - ahead of the stockmarket opening that signalled another punishing assault on HBOS. It was McCarthy. \"The tripartite authorities must have talked about it as indeed they should,\" said Blank. </p> <p>Daniels and Hornby agreed to meet on Tuesday. They wanted to get a deal done that day, by Wednesday at the latest. But before they could announce their hastily arranged marriage, the BBC broadcast it to the world on Wednesday morning - helping arrest a slide in the HBOS shares that now smacked of panic. </p> <p>The teams had a few rows over what Lloyds should pay - eventually agreeing on a 44% to 56% split in the combined business between HBOS and Lloyds TSB - and then had to deal with a demand from Downing Street to keep lending in the frozen mortgage market.</p> <p>Blank insists that the controversial pledge to keep Scottish jobs was not requested by Labour, which is facing defeat in the Glenrothes byelection on November 6. The two management teams were simply trying to display the bank's sensitivities towards Scotland, where they both have large scale operations. \"It was not a mistake to make the statement about Scotland but a mistake to make a statement only about Scotland.\" Estimates of 40,000 job cuts from a combined workforce of 140,000 are dismissed, but no alternative number offered.</p> <p>He said Lloyds shareholders had been supportive of the transaction and acknowledged concerns that the combined bank might be weakened by HBOS. The share prices of the two banks show some doubts still remain that the deal will be done. </p> <p>Blank said capital would be preserved by paying dividends in shares and selling off non-core businesses such as HBOS's BankWest.</p> <p>Does he think short-sellers are to blame for the demise of HBOS? \"I don't know if it was a victim of short-selling but it does seem to have been the victim of the most extraordinary market speculation, which didn't help them.\" </p> <p>Answering his own questions, Blank said: \"Would the deal have happened anyway? We'd have wanted it to. Why did the government and the authorities feel it was important? Because they saw a prospective draining of confidence and felt that it had to be stopped. Was that down to market movements? No, but was that a factor? Yes.</p> <p>\"The government, to be fair to them, behaved very speedily and with perception,\" said Blank, who would not have said the same a year ago when Lloyds was being asked to take over Northern Rock. And despite all the concerns about the financial system, he insists the \"high-street banking system is safe\", citing the government guarantee of the first \u00a335,000 of savings.</p> <p>The enormous deal that has now been sanctioned by the authorities will create a national banking champion that was unthinkable until the credit crunch wreaked its havoc on the world markets. \"There'll be two or three years of really hard work,\" said Blank. \"We intend to be good for customers; we'll be bigger, stronger, and in a few years we can look [for expansion] geographically.\" </p> <p>Just in time, then, for Lloyds to use its \u00a380m sponsorship of the London Olympics to maximum effect. Did Brown lean on his friend to back the games? \"Don't think so,\" he said, pausing momentarily before laying the blame on Lord Coe, the front-man for the games.</p> <p>Blank's political tentacles extend not just to Gordon and Sarah Brown, whom he calls his friends, but to Alastair Campbell and Tony Blair, and also to Sir John Major, the former Conservative prime minister whose friendship caused some controversy in Labour ranks when Blank was chairman of the publisher Trinity Mirror.</p> <p>\"I think I'm probably as centrist as you can be. Having been in a service business for a number of years, it's terribly important for the people you look after to get access in the political world.\"</p> <p>He hopes his legacy for the 2012 games will be that young people play more sport. \"We want to help people in communities and help them to do more sport. There's lots of evidence that if they do more sport they drink less and misbehave in the streets less.\" </p> <p><strong>Passion</strong></p> <p>Cricket is his real passion. Every year his Oxford manor house hosts a cricket tournament attended by the great and the good to raise funds for the Wellbeing women's charity, which is close to his heart after the death of his mother, when he was 12, from ovarian cancer.</p> <p>Brought up by his father - the son of a Ukrainian immigrant - in Stockport, Blank went to Oxford before becoming a partner at a City law firm aged 26. He co-wrote the definitive guide on how to do deals and eventually went on to the boutique bank Charterhouse, where he made his fortune after masterminding the buyout of Woolworths.</p> <p>Despite his own wealth, he is critical of pay in the City. \"It's absolutely crucial that we scrutinise the way people are being paid so that their interests cannot be out of kilter with the interests of the institutions and its customers. It does look as if in some places we've got that wrong. It's time for a debate about it.\"</p> <p>Time then for Blank to step in and use his sense of duty to lead a rumoured government review? \"Fortunately not,\" laughs Blank, thankful that he has the excuse of needing to focus on creating a bank for Britain.</p> <h2>The CV</h2> <p><strong>Born:</strong> November 9, 1942</p> <p><strong>Education:</strong> Stockport Grammar School; Modern History at St Catherine's College, Oxford </p> <p><strong>Career:</strong> Former partner at Clifford Turner (now Clifford Chance), 1969-81; chairman and chief executive of Charterhouse investment bank until 1997; director of Royal Bank of Scotland, 1985-93; GUS, 1993-2006 (chairman from 2000).

  "<p>MEPs yesterday put the European parliament on a collision course with Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel, and its powerful car lobby by rejecting Berlin's campaign to water down European proposals for slashing greenhouse gases from road traffic.</p> <p>In a move that stunned the car industry and green campaigners, the parliament's environment committee voted by a sweeping majority to force car manufacturers to reduce the carbon dioxide emissions of new vehicles by 2012 and to maintain stringent fines on those that fail to do so. </p> <p>The MEPs threw out amendments that the car lobby had introduced which would have eased the costs to industry and delayed the measures. By voting them down, the MEPs rejected a Franco-German pact hatched by Merkel and France's president, Nicolas Sarkozy, in June.</p> <p>As part of its drive to lead the world in tackling climate change, the European commission last year proposed that all new cars would have to cut their CO2 emissions to 130 grammes per kilometre by 2012, roughly a 17% reduction on average emission levels. The German auto industry, a world leader in the large car sector, cried foul and mounted ferocious lobbying to dilute the proposals.</p> <p>Merkel has fought energetically for months to get the proposed regime weakened. At a summit in June with Sarkozy (who is currently chairing the EU and responsible for steering the climate- change package into law by the end of the year), both leaders agreed that the original commission proposals should be weakened by staggering the cuts until 2015, and halving the proposed fines levied on car firms for each offending vehicle they produced from \u20ac95 (\u00a375) per excess gramme/kilometre to \u20ac50.</p> <p>The environment committee yesterday rejected both compromise measures, backing the commission's initial proposals and stipulating that CO2 emissions should come down further, to 95g/km by 2020. The parliament's industry committee had already caved in to pressure and supported the diluted proposals.</p> <p>\"The parliament appears to have stood up to the demands of the car industry and four or five car-producing member states, and has sent a strong signal that Europeans need fuel-efficient cars now, not in five or 10 years,\" said Jos Tings, of the Transport and Environment pressure group.</p> <p>\"The lobby from the car industry lost,\" said Chris Davies, the Liberal Democrats' environment spokesman. \"MEPs today stood up for tougher measures to combat global warming and sent a strong message to corporate lobbyists to back off. A good day for democracy.\"</p> <p>The result was all the more surprising since, under intense car industry pressure, the two biggest caucuses in the parliament, the centre-right European People's party and the socialists, had tabled amendments in line with the Merkel-Sarkozy deal. But in the end the committee's vote was 46-19.</p> <p>The CO2 emissions of cars make up about 14% of such emissions in Europe. The commission proposals are a key part of the overall climate-change package to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 - proposals that need to be turned into law by the end of the year if the EU is to maintain its credibility as a world leader in the fight against global warming. The overall package has to be agreed by the commission, the parliament and the 27 EU governments, meaning there is now likely to be a showdown between Berlin and the parliament before Christmas.</p> <p>\"This was a big surprise,\" said the German Green MEP Rebecca Harms. \"There was a big fight with industry and governments, and the Germans and French were adding a lot of pressure.\"</p> <p>European leaders have endorsed the broad aims of the commission proposals and proclaimed themselves world leaders in tackling global warming, but the real battles - about dividing the burden between nations and sectors of industry - are now breaking out.</p> <h2>Backstory</h2> <p>A summit of European leaders agreed in March last year to cut <strong>greenhouse gases </strong>by a minimum of <strong>20% </strong>by 2020. A month earlier the commission had proposed to compel the car industry to cut CO2 emissions from new cars and vans to <strong>130g/km</strong>. The commission refined its proposals last December. But <strong>Merkel</strong>, a former environment minister who presided over the March summit and was hailed as a hero, railed against the <strong>costs to industry</strong>. In March this year she broached the topic with <strong>Sarkozy</strong>,<strong> </strong>who was preparing to assume the EU presidency and steer the climate change package into law. At a bilateral summit in June, the two agreed to <strong>water down </strong>the proposals.</p>",
  "<p>Last season's Guinness Premiership was widely considered to be the most entertaining on record, adventure and daring replacing the caution and attrition that had previously blighted the tournament. But after three rounds this season, clubs are concerned that spectators will turn their backs on the game as a refereeing crackdown on the tackle area leads to a surfeit of penalties and kick-and-chase rugby.</p> <p>If a few months ago coaches were concerned at the impact the Experimental Law Variations would have on the game, their preoccupation now is the International Rugby Board directive to referees to police the tackle area and rucks in accordance with written laws. Transgressions, however minor, are being blown up and the effect is like a blitz on motorway speeding, treating those travelling at 71mph the same as ton-up merchants.</p> <p>The aim of the directive is to ensure a contest for possession at the breakdown. IRB figures showed a continuity rate of 96% before the start of this season; that has already come down to 85%, but sides have become so concerned about being blown up after a tackle, or turned over, that they have resorted to kicking out of hand more, especially in their own territory.</p> <p>Coaches believe that one of the six guidelines issued by the IRB, which stresses that the tackler must be the referee's first priority and that he/she must immediately release the tackled player and get up or move away, is not being observed. \"Defences have become very cute,\" said Bristol's head coach, Richard Hill. \"They are forcing attackers to seal off because the tackled player is not being penalised for not rolling away and you face losing your ball. Referees have to look at the tackler closely.</p> <p>\"Another concern of mine is that players are being penalised for peripheral indiscretions. Mariano Sambucetti was penalised for us against Sale last week - he went over a ruck, kept his head and knees up and put his hands on the floor. He did not seal the ball off but was in a bridge position. That was harsh, and lesser offences are being picked up. I thought things would settle down after four or five rounds of the Premiership but it is going to take longer and, in the meantime, other offences such as encroaching behind are not being detected.\"</p> <p>The IRB is convening a meeting of referees on the international panel in London before the start of the November internationals. It remains unrepentant about the directive but has also warned assistant referees, as touch judges are now called, that they should be more vigilant in spotting offences away from the breakdown and informing match referees.</p> <p>\"I believe that the referees are looking so hard at the Experimental Law Variations that they are finding it difficult to see the other laws,\" said Saracens' director of rugby, Eddie Jones. \"The lineout has become a difficult area and there is great indecision about what is allowed at the tackle area.\"</p> <p>Wasps, the champions, have yet to win a game this season and their director of rugby, Ian McGeechan, believes the directive and the law variations are a disincentive to play attacking rugby. \"It seems to me that a strong kicking game and a decent chase are now enough to win you a match, while anything more imaginative stands every chance of losing you one,\" he said. \"It might boil down to coaches trying to stop good players playing. I watched a couple of Tri Nations Tests during the summer and all I saw was good players not playing rugby. I'm not sure this is what we really want for the sport.\"</p> <p>Players are equally vexed. \"The new laws were designed to speed up the game but they have merely led to more kicking,\" said the Leicester captain, Martin Corry. \"You can penalise either side at any breakdown.\"</p> <p>Northampton's captain, Bruce Reihana, concurred. \"There is a lot of frustration at the moment because of the penalties being given away at the breakdown, which seem to vary from week to week. We like to play with speed but we are going to have to adapt.\"</p> <p>The Rugby Football Union's head of elite referee development, Ed Morrison, said that players had to adapt to the directive. \"The breakdown is a complex area and that is why we made around 30 visits to Premiership clubs in the summer to get some uniformity and understanding by everyone. I am a big supporter of the tackle area being a fair and reasonable contest. To enable that to take place we have to have people on their feet and one of the weaknesses of the game over the last few years is that more and more players have been going to ground. Players, coaches and referees have a responsibility to operate within the framework of the law. Providing that we all buy into that process to ensure people stay on their feet then we will have a better game.\"</p>",
  "<h2>Pakistani troops fire at US helicopters near border</h2> <p>Pakistani troops fired at US reconnaissance helicopters patrolling the Afghan-Pakistan border yesterday, but there was no damage to aircraft or crew, American officials said. A US military spokesman, Sgt Kevin Wallace, said the two helicopters were on a routine patrol in the eastern Afghan province of Khost. \"They did not cross the border and did not fire back,\" he said. US forces and Pakistan's military \"are working together to resolve the matter\", a Nato statement said. Pakistan's military spokesman, Maj Gen Athar Abbas, said Pakistani units had \"very clear\" orders not to fire across the border. <br><strong>Associated Press in Kabul</strong></p> <h2>Father abandons nine children under new law</h2> <p>Nine children were left at a hospital by their father under Nebraska's new \"safe haven\" law. The father, who was not identified, left the children aged one to 17 as the law, which came into effect in July, allows carers to abandon children at any state-licensed hospital without fear of prosecution. It was initially intended to protect infants, like similar laws in other states ... but was amended to include older children and teenagers. At least four children between 11 and 15 have been abandoned by parents since the law took effect. Nebraska was the last state in the nation to adopt a safe-haven law. <br><strong>Associated Press in Omaha </strong></p> <h2>Man convicted of plotting to behead prime minister</h2> <p>A Canadian aged 20 was found guilty yesterday of knowingly participating in a terrorist group accused of plotting to storm Canada's parliament and behead the prime minister.

The young man is the first person to be found guilty of a terrorist offence in Canada since the country enacted anti-terrorism laws in 2001.

  "<p>In a review of My Cousin Vinny for this newspaper in 1992, I praised Joe Pesci for his performance in GoodFellas, claiming that one of the most satisfying things about Scorsese's gangster picture was \"discovering\" Pesci in it. I wrote: \"It was the kind of performance which made you want to get out Raging Bull, Once Upon a Time in America and Lethal Weapon 2 on video, wondering why you failed to take much notice of him first time round.\"</p> <p>Sixteen years later, I know enough about the film-making process never to write a review like that again. To credit Pesci with being the author of his \"performance\" - to imagine that he is primarily responsible for the fact that he leaps out of the screen in GoodFellas - is woefully naive. It is precisely the sort of mistake that a critic who had never set foot on a movie set would make.</p> <p>I've just finished co-producing How to Lose Friends &amp; Alienate People, the forthcoming film based on my book of the same name, but that is not the only experience that has upended my whole critical perspective. I wrote a picture for Warner Bros in 2003, and I have worked on screenplays and treatments for half a dozen other films, some of which have sold. More importantly, I have spent the past 15 years or so hanging out with directors, producers, writers, actors, editors, distributors - even studio heads - and used that access to try and learn as much as I can about the movie business. I am constantly struck by how often their answers have challenged my preconceptions as a critic.</p> <p>For instance, there was the time I sat next to one of the producers of The Queen at a dinner party. I praised the film for presenting her as an essentially vulnerable figure and singled out the scene towards the end in which she tells Tony Blair that she was \"just a girl\" when she ascended to the throne. \"Peter Morgan's such a great writer,\" I said. \"Actually, Scott Rudin came up with that,\" he said.</p> <p>As a reviewer, I always accepted that film is a collaborative medium, but until I started spending time with film-makers I had no idea just how true that is. It is most obvious when it comes to the screenplay. It is fairly well known that the officially credited writers of a film are rarely, if ever, the only authors of the shooting script, but I was still shocked when a famous screenwriter confided he'd been Oscar-nominated for a film he hadn't written a single word of.</p> <p>But it's not just the screenwriter who is a largely fictional construct. The word director can also be very misleading, with the control they exert varying enormously from film to film. If it is a low-budget, independent picture that the director in question has written and produced, then, obviously, it will be his or her baby. But the role of the person calling the shots on a film like that will be so different from the role of, say, Christopher Nolan on The Dark Knight, that it's ludicrous to use the same word to describe what they do. (\"Traffic cop\" was the phrase that the director of one of the biggest blockbusters of last summer used.) On the whole, directors hate making these big-budget popcorn movies precisely because they have so little room to manoeuvre. Like the actors, they do it for the money - which isn't to say the pictures necessarily turn out badly. In fact, they are often better than the low-budget \"passion projects\" that the same directors pour their hearts and souls into.</p> <p>I now realise that describing someone as the \"director\" - or \"screenwriter\" or \"producer\" - is completely misleading, in that there are no clearly circumscribed areas of responsibility on a film set. Those official titles are, at best, starting points, guideposts that sometimes point you in the right direction, but equally often lead you astray. Film-making is a fluid, mercurial process in which power is constantly changing hands, not just between individuals, but between groups of individuals, creating makeshift alliances that can dissolve at any second.</p> <p>In fact, visiting a film set is a lot like taking a tour of the House of Commons, with little cabals of conspirators everywhere. Who's in charge? Who's in and who's out? People's official titles are the equivalent of what Walter Bagehot called the \"dignified\" part of the English constitution. The \"efficient\" part - where power really lies - is concealed beneath that facade.</p> <p>To give just one example, Mike Figgis told me that when he was making Mr Jones, Mike Medavoy, then chairman of TriStar Pictures, invited him to see the trailer that the studio had cut of the film without Figgis's knowledge. \"It'll give you an idea of the film you should be making,\" said Medavoy.</p> <p>Almost every aspect of the film-making process can become a battleground, but the most common place for conflict is the cutting room. As a fledgling critic, I hadn't realised the extent to which films are created \"in the edit\". I'm not just talking about obvious things like the shape of any given scene, but whether that scene is funny or not. Alexander Mackendrick, the director of Whisky Galore and Sweet Smell of Success, pointed out that you can always make a scene funnier by shaving a little bit off the beginning and the end. That is profoundly true - and there are many disastrous comedies that have been saved by skilled editors. </p> <p>Perhaps the biggest surprise is how an editor can make an actor who has \"phoned in\" his performance look like he's been immersed in the role for months. What the director sends over in the can is just paint on the editor's palette. If any member of a film's crew deserves to be called an artist it is the editor, but, of course, they are rarely allowed to exercise their craft without a host of power-crazed egomaniacs breathing down their necks. Typically, the director, writer and producer will all have their own ideas about how the film should be cut, and the finished article is frequently some bizarre mishmash. It is hardly surprising that how a movie turns out is largely dependent on luck.</p> <p>Pauline Kael, the New Yorker's celebrated movie critic, worked for Paramount between 1979 and 1980 and concluded that Hollywood studios produce many terrible pictures because the people calling the shots know nothing about film-making and are only interested in making money.</p> <p>Like most critics, I took that as gospel, but I've now come to the opposite conclusion. The reason so many pictures turn out badly, in my experience, is because the so-called \"artists\" - particularly the directors - behave like prima donnas, imagining they can wrest control over the entire process, while the \"suits\" have to battle to be heard. And this, in spite of the fact they often know more about movie-making than the people they employ to make them. In general, the attitude of the people on the business side is more mature than those on the creative side. Rather than see themselves locked in a struggle between art and commerce, they recognise that the two are inseparable, that for a film to \"work\" it has to succeed both artistically and commercially.</p> <p>Towards the end of Kael's life I asked her about her sojourn in Hollywood. She wouldn't tell me which movies she'd worked on, but she did say that when the makers of the pictures in question had taken her advice they'd worked out well, and when they hadn't, the films had turned out badly. She overlooked the fact she had offered this advice in her capacity as a studio executive, not as an independent critic. It was true in 1980 and it remains true today: when film-makers listen to the \"suits\", their movies turn out better.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>How to Lose Friends and Alienate People is released on October 3</p>",
  "<p>Neville Armstrong, who has died aged 94, was one of the last of the gentlemen publishers who produced books mirroring their own whims and tastes in a form of cottage industry. In Neville's case, he published between five and six hundred books over 40 years, covering such subjects as flying saucers, the occult, wrestling, reincarnation, spiritualism, spies, sex, cooking, chess and Spain. </p> <p>He was also the publisher of the English-language edition of Jean-Paul Sartre's Intimacy, No Mean City by A McArthur and H Kingsley-Long and The Ginger Man by JP Donleavy. I worked for him for many years, and we remained close friends.</p> <p>Neville was born on his father's tea plantation in Sri Lanka but, at the age of five, was given to his maiden aunt to bring up in England, leaving behind his parents, two brothers and a sister. Amazingly, he was later to say that this was a successful arrangement. He left public school without passing an exam and, endowed with good looks and a sweet voice, went on to Rada. Then, after four years of struggle, he left the theatre or, as Margaret Rutherford put it to him: \"You mean, dear boy, the theatre left you.\"</p> <p>In 1940 Neville joined the army and spent two years as a clerk in the western desert - until it was realised he came from Sri Lanka. He was promptly promoted to second lieutenant in an Indian regiment, the Rajputana Rifles, and put in charge of a bren gun carrier platoon, although he was unable to speak a word of Urdu. After taking part in the battle of Monte Cassino in Italy, he was sent to Delhi, where he was seconded to the Intelligence Corps.</p> <p>On demobilisation he became an impresario at the Bolton's Theatre in South Kensington, London. This being \"great fun\", rather than profitable, he eventually gave it up to become a literary agent for magazine stories, a job that evolved into book publishing. At first he teamed up with John Calder to form Spearman Calder, then with Peter Owen to form Peter Nevill. In 1955 he began his own imprint, Neville Spearman Publishers, based in London until he moved to Suffolk in the late 1970s.</p> <p>Neville and his wife Peggy had separated by 1958, when Lili Munk came into his life. He and Lili lived together for more than 30 years before marrying on a gloriously sunny day in 1999 in a Buddhist ceremony on the lawn of their house at Great Waldingfield, Suffolk.</p> <p>Shortly after his mother committed suicide in 1964, Neville had become a Samaritan, No 650, trained by the founder, Chad Varah. He was a man with enormous energy and enthusiasm, with an innate curiosity. Lili survives him, as does Simon, the son of his first marriage.</p>",

On television, she appeared as Ruth Anderson in the 1976 BBC series Survivors and played opposite Sam Neill in Reilly: Ace of Spies in 1983. </p> <p>Her copious TV work also included Hammer House of Horror, The Professionals, Bergerac, Tales of the Unexpected, Ruth Rendell Mysteries and The Casebook of Sherlock Holmes, with Jeremy Brett in the title role. Her films included Agatha (1979), with Dustin Hoffman and Vanessa Redgrave, The Inside Man (1984), with Dennis Hopper, and Peter Greenaway's The Baby of M\u00e2con (1993), her last film role.</p> <p>We first met Celia when we joined the Tyneside Theatre Company, Newcastle in 1973. For us, fresh from our respective drama schools, Celia seemed the \"seasoned pro\", having by then completed a season at Lancaster rep. When she walked into the room on our first day, all heads turned. Celia radiated beauty effortlessly, inside and out. Hers was a sensual beauty not unlike Ava Gardner's, with dancing eyes, and an earthy, naughty laugh.</p> <p>She was born in London but her parents divorced and her mother remarried, to a German industrialist, so she grew up in Switzerland, Germany and Holland. She learned German, French, Portuguese and Italian. As well as her two sisters, she gained three stepbrothers who had been raised in Brazil. Their love of all things Latin inspired Celia's guitar-playing and wonderful singing. </p> <p>She and her sisters were sent to boarding school at Moira House in Eastbourne, Sussex. Celia went to finishing school in Italy before training at Studio 68 drama school in London. Despite her privileged background, she loved the freedom of the actor's life and the company of creative people. She was equally comfortable dining at the Ivy or picnicking in the rain. </p> <p>She seemed to us so exotic and such a woman of the world, with innate elegance and taste. She loved the fine things in life and always dressed with great flair, half jet-set and half Gypsy. Friends had to be careful not to admire something Celia was wearing because she would take it off there and then and hand it over. Her heart was huge and her generosity was boundless, qualities that suffused her acting roles. </p> <p>She was not a technical actor; her brilliance was born out of raw intelligence, understanding of people and an appetite for life. She possessed that rare quality, stage presence. During our year in Newcastle, she played Masha in The Three Sisters with insight and experience beyond her 24 years, and her Gertrude to Jack Shepherd's Hamlet was maternal and passionate.</p> <p>After marrying Keith Bender and having two children, Charles in 1984 and Peter in 1987, Celia continued to work occasionally until 1993, when she chose to devote more time to her family. Family meant everything to her. Christmas at her home followed the German tradition of being celebrated on Christmas Eve, and even if times were lean, she would lay a beautiful table with the family linen and silver, gather her loved ones around her and pamper everyone. The evening would usually end with her playing her guitar and belting out her beloved Brazilian songs.</p> <p>She is survived by her sons, her sisters Leyla and Yvonne, and her brothers, Klaus, Uli and Andreas. Her marriage ended in divorce.</p> <p><strong>Jan Sargent writes ... </strong>From the very first time I worked with Celia, it was her ability to transform that impressed, from the plaintive, funny, innocent and complex Jo in A Taste of Honey, to the ravishing, passionate Masha in The Three Sisters, devouring Vershinin with a glance. She was incapable of false delivery and lived every part as if it were her last.</p> <p>She became my muse as a director, and when I moved to TV, whether it was the mother of a lost child in the Ruth Rendell Mysteries, a sophisticated fraudster in Perfect Scoundrels or other parts in Casualty or Juliet Bravo, she was always my first choice. Her translucent beauty, loved by the camera, her grace on stage and her husky voice remain vivid, and the generosity she lavished on her friends was, like her talent, wholehearted and uncompromising.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Celia Christine Gregory, actor, born September 23 1949; died September 8 2008</p>",
  "<p>A prominent Israeli professor and peace advocate was injured yesterday when a pipe bomb blew up outside his house in what police believe was an attack by right-wing Jewish extremists.</p> <p>Zeev Sternhell, a political scientist at Hebrew University, was wounded in the leg when the bomb exploded as he stepped out of his front door to close the garden gate in Jerusalem. </p> <p>Police found posters in the area offering a reward of around \u00a3170,000 to anyone who kills a member of Peace Now, a well-known Israeli group which campaigns against the occupation. Sternhell has long been a Peace Now supporter.</p> <p>Tzipi Livni, who is forming a coalition to become the next prime minister, said the attack was \"intolerable\".</p> <p>Sternhell, a respected academic and Holocaust survivor who studied the history of fascism, has publicly criticised the Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank. He was awarded the Israel Prize this year, although some settlers petitioned the supreme court to try to prevent him receiving the award. He had reportedly received threats in the past.</p> <p>If the attack is proven to come from a rightwing group it would mark a rare display of Jewish extremist violence within Israel. There are frequently violent clashes between hardline ideological settlers and soldiers on patrol in the West Bank: some of the most extreme settlers attack soldiers involved in any attempt to take down or remove settlement outposts.</p> <p>Those attacks have grown more common and more violent in recent months, apparently deterring the Israeli government from any serious effort to remove the settlements, all of which are illegal under international law.</p> <p>The most significant rightwing attack in recent Israeli history was the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister who signed the Oslo peace accords and was gunned down as he left a large rally in Tel Aviv in 1995.</p>",
  "<p>One of Britain's most senior counter-terrorism officers was yesterday accused of making a string of blunders that led to the killing of Jean Charles de Menezes by police at Stockwell tube station.</p> <p>Some of the surveillance officers sent to a south London address to try to identify a terrorist suspect were not given a picture of the man they were hunting for, an inquest jury heard.</p> <p>It was also alleged that officers who had an image of the suspect only had a poor quality picture, despite the fact that better quality images were available to police hours before they were sent to the scene.</p> <p>The innocent Brazilian electrician was killed on July 22 2005, the day after four attempted bomb attacks on London's transport system.</p> <p>Police believed Hussain Osman, one of the July 21 bombers, lived at the same block of flats as De Menezes. They were led to the address by a gym card found in a rucksack carrying the bomb that only partially went off at Shepherd's Bush underground station.</p> <p>The jury heard that three photographs had been recovered from a gym bag found at the scene of the bombing with clearer images of Osman. But they were never issued to officers.</p> <p>Scotland Yard officer John McDowall, who was in charge of the hunt for the failed 21/7 bombers, faced questioning yesterday by Michael Mansfield QC, representing the De Menezes family. Since the shooting, McDowall has been promoted to deputy assistant commissioner and is the national coordinator for counter-terrorism investigations.</p> <p>The jury watched as Mansfield said: \"I'm going to suggest to you, there is quite a lot that didn't occur to you that night ... quite a lot didn't occur to you that led to the death of this innocent man.\"</p> <p>\"I do not accept that,\" McDowall replied.</p> <p>\"Were you aware that in fact, some of [the police officers] were on patrol ... without a photograph at all?\"</p> <p>McDowall replied: \"No I wasn't,\" before agreeing it was not \"best practice\".</p> <p>Mansfield said the clear pictures of Osman were available to police by 4am. They had been found torn up, but had been put back together by detectives.</p> <p>Mansfield said a senior officer knew about the pictures when he held a meeting with McDowall at 4.20am.</p> <p>Mansfield asked: \"Can you explain why the photographs weren't used?\" </p> <p>\"No,\" McDowall replied.</p> <p>Just before 5am, McDowall had ordered officers to the Scotia Road address. Special branch officers were to monitor who went in and out, while an elite firearms team was to stop people away from the address to see if they were the suspect. McDowall based his strategy on the belief that 21 Scotia Road was a single home, when in fact it was a block of nine flats with one communal entrance. </p> <p>Mansfield asked why McDowall had not studied a map of the area or address, adding: \"These are pretty straightforward issues, aren't they?\" </p> <p>McDowall replied: \"I was led to understand it was one address.\"</p> <p>He said the hunt for Osman was one of several he was overseeing that day: \"We don't expect people to be superhuman,\" he said, adding that it would have been impossible to \"have retained that grasp of detail on everything\".</p> <p>The inquest continues.</p>",
  "<p>It was the golden age of Hollywood, a time when movies defined who we were and what we did. But it was also the golden age of tobacco sponsorship, a time when tobacco companies paid stars thousands of dollars - as well as a year's supply of cigarettes - to promote their products on and off-screen.</p> <p>A new report shows just how lucrative the tie-up was for some of the biggest stars of the era. In 1937-8, actors including Gary Cooper, Joan Crawford, Clark Gable and Spencer Tracy, were each paid $10,000 (the equivalent to $146,000, or \u00a380,000, in today's money) by American Tobacco to promote its Lucky Strike brand. That year, the cigarette company paid film stars $218,750 - more than $3m at today's prices.</p> <p>The report, published in the journal Tobacco Control, says almost 200 stars, including two-thirds of the top box-office actors of the late 1930s and 1940s, were contracted to tobacco companies.</p> <p>The relationship between cigarettes and the movies, started with the advent of the talkies. In 1927, Al Jolson, star of The Jazz Singer, pitched for Lucky Strike and his studio, Warner Bros. </p> <p>\"Talking pictures demand a clear voice,\" the star was quoted as saying in a newspaper advert lauding the \"toasting\" process used in Lucky Strikes. \"Toasting kills off all the irritants, so my voice is clear as a bell in every scene. Folks, let me tell you, the good old flavour of Luckies is as sweet and soothing as the best 'Mammy' song ever written.\"</p> <p>That campaign was the subject of an inquiry by the Federal Trade Commission that concluded that American Tobacco's advertising was misleading.</p> <p>But others followed suit. The same year, director King Vidor said: \"It is wonderful to find a cigarette that relaxes your nerves, and at the same time insures you against throat irritation - a condition from which film directors are bound to suffer.\"</p> <p>The promotion of cigarettes as sophisticated and healthy was a task that might have been created for the acting profession. In 1937, Carole Lombard was paid to say: \"In making Swing High, Swing Low there was an unusual strain on my throat ... I could smoke Luckies all day without throat irritation. Most others on the set also prefer them.\"</p> <p>The notion of Luckies as the tobacco of choice among film stars was one that American worked hard to create.</p> <p>\"It's always easy for me to get a Lucky from Joan Crawford or Clark Gable,\" Myrna Loy wrote in a signed testimonial in 1937, \"or even from most of the newcomers to the studio.\"</p> <p>By the 1940s, the tobacco companies were sponsoring radio shows featuring the stars relaxing on set and talking about subjects as diverse as their new film and their favourite brand.</p> <p>\"You know Lauren, that cigarette I gave you is a Lucky Strike,\" Jack Benny told Lauren Bacall, the guest on his radio show in the first week of 1947, during the filming of To Have and Have Not.</p> <p>\"I know, and it's my favourite brand, too,\" replies Bacall. \"They're so round ... so firm ... so fully packed ... so free and easy on the draw.\"</p> <p>Advertisers worked to ensure smoking was integral to film-making, and that smoke in a film was seen as evidence of artistic endeavour. The truth, argues the report, is that the relationship was created by commercial convenience.</p> <p>\"The legacy of cross-promotion during the golden age of Hollywood ... continues to be used to rationalise smoking as integral to the art of film-making. Evidence suggests that this integration was a commercial collaboration 'signed, sealed and delivered' by the tobacco companies, major studios and many of the era's best-remembered stars.\"</p> <p>By the early 1950s the tobacco industry switched its attention to TV. But by 1980, smoking on screen was making a comeback, despite increased knowledge of the dangers to health.</p> <p>The controversy over smoking on screen continues today, but the report dismisses opponents of efforts to give films that include smoking an \"R\" or 18 rating.</p> <p>\"The presumption,\" says the report, \"is that mainstream motion pictures are an art form into which social agendas should not intrude. The pattern of close cooperation between the film and tobacco industries ... suggests instead that the motion picture industry was always ready to cater to the tobacco industry's commercial agenda.\"</p>",
  "<p>When Natalie Cole released her album, Unforgettable ... With Love, in 1991, many in the music industry suspected she had gone mad. This was the era of grunge and gangsta rap, and the idea of a pop singer releasing a collection of American jazz standards was unheard of. \"My record company thought I was crazy,\" she says. \"They were like, 'It'll never sell.'\" So they were in for another shock when the album rocketed towards sales of 14m copies. \"It was a lot of fun watching people panic,\" she laughs. \"The radio programmers, the record labels, the stores. They were reporting, 'People are buying this who haven't bought a record in 20 years!'\"</p> <p>The collection featured a duet with her late father, Nat King Cole, and set a benchmark for the American standards movement; since then, everyone from Rod Stewart to Robbie Williams has crooned their way through the classics. Seventeen years later, Cole is delving into the songbook again with Still Unforgettable, wrapping her vocals around classics such as Come Rain Or Come Shine and Something's Gotta Give. Why did it take so long for her to do a follow-up? \"It takes a long time to chase greatness,\" she says simply.</p> <p>At 58, Cole is a mix of quite jaw-dropping confidence and a hint of vulnerability. Having sung with Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett and Ray Charles, she receives a lot of requests to do duets with \"Joe Schmoe\". \"No thank you,\" she says in a mock-polite voice. \"I've sung with the best ... so I don't wanna sing with just anybody.\" But she admits that it has taken until her 21st studio album to feel comfortable producing her own record. \"I have really been doing it most of my career,\" she says, \"but I was just paying someone else to do it while I looked over their shoulder. I always felt I needed someone telling me what to do. Turns out that I didn't need that at all.\"</p> <p>Cole bristles as she reflects on the inequities of the music business, in which women's private lives are constantly monitored, and \"it's not so much about their talent, it's about their visual\". She thinks that there is a lot more pressure on female artists than when she started. \"Women are required to look good 24 hours a day. Oh my God. Sheryl Crow's about the only one who gets away with wearing jeans. That takes a lot of time. You'd rather be spending time on your work, your craft, and you have to spend three or four hours in makeup for a show that might last 45 minutes! \" </p> <p>She is more than happy to call herself a feminist. \"I believe that a woman should be paid the same amount as a man if she does the same job. I think that we're extraordinary creatures who can run a company and a house ... \" </p> <p>Growing up, the fame of Cole's father inevitably led to insecurities about her own talent. Nat King Cole became a major mainstream black icon in the 40s and 50s after hits such as Mona Lisa and When I Fall In Love, and always refused to play segregated venues. In 1956 he became one of the first African-Americans to host a network TV show. Despite ratings success, NBC quickly dropped the programme because sponsors were nervous about backing a black artist - Cole famously quipped that, \"Madison Avenue is afraid of the dark.\"</p> <p>Natalie Cole was just 15 when her father died of lung cancer in 1965, and his death had a profound effect. \"When you lose a parent in your early teens, it's like you're still a child. I never got to make that transition from little girl to young woman . . . and that really screws you up.\" She dealt with the grief by trying to distance herself from the memory of her father. For a long time, she says, \"I hated my name, I thought it was horrible. It was too much pressure. Well, whose daughter are you? Duh! I didn't feel like I was an individual.\"</p> <p>Cole grew up in a wealthy white enclave of Los Angeles, and, attending the University of Massachusetts in the late 1960s, she reacted against her upbringing by growing an afro and joining the Black Panthers. She was also at the forefront of the anti-Vietnam war demonstrations. \"My mother goes to me, 'I didn't send you to school to do that,'\" says Cole. \"But you don't sit at the side and discourse - you get in there! I was part of a generation of people who tried to make a difference, and I'm proud of that. I was raised in a very protected environment and didn't have a lot of black friends as a child. When I went to college I realised I was a black person too. It was a great eye-opener for me, which is why I got involved.\" </p> <p>How does she feel now about the prospect of a black president? \"I would love to see Obama in the White House,\" she says. \"My country is in such disrepair, morally and financially, that we need his ideals and integrity. The fact that he's black makes me proud, but even if he wasn't, I'd still want him to be president.\" </p> <p>Cole may have inherited her father's idealism, but as a performer in the early 70s she was keen to forge a distinct musical identity, and flung herself headlong into funk and R&amp;B. In 1975 she had her first No 1 single with This Will Be (An Everlasting Love) and won a Grammy award for her debut album, Inseparable. At the same time, her personal life was careering out of control. She had developed an addiction to heroin and crack cocaine that was so serious that she crashed her car while high and her young son, Robert, nearly drowned in the family pool when she was on a drug binge. Cole hit rock bottom when she refused to leave a burning building because she needed to score. In her 2000 autobiography, Angel on My Shoulder, she writes: \"Smoke poured under the door to my hotel suite. It was so thick that it was getting hard to breathe.\" She was trapped in the room with her bodyguard, and, in the belief that they were doomed, he suggested they have sex. Cole had other ideas. \"No thanks,' I said, 'If I'm going to go, I'm not going straight.' I fished my freebase kit out of my purse and started cooking cocaine.'\" </p> <p>When they were rescued, Cole realised it was time to address her addiction. She went into rehab in 1983. \"I literally lay my life in their hands, not knowing if there was a career left for me, not knowing if I could keep custody of my son. At some point everything starts disintegrating around you, and you have to make a choice. That one commitment to do whatever it takes means exactly what it says. It's not easy.\"</p> <p>By the late 80s Cole was off drugs and released Dangerous, her first \"sober album\". \"I was very vulnerable,\" she says now. </p> <p>\"I didn't know what was gonna happen. I had to believe that talent was going to make the difference. Luckily, it did.\" Dangerous yielded several Top 10 hits, including a version of Bruce Springsteen's Pink Cadillac. </p> <p>From then on, Cole steadily rebuilt her career until she reached a place of relative harmony; with two marriages and one annulment behind her, it has been hard-won. That is why she reacted instinctively when she saw Amy Winehouse perform at the Grammy Awards earlier this year. At a party afterwards Cole told journalists, \"I don't agree with the Grammys giving [Amy] those nods. I think it sends the wrong message.\" The next day her comments were headline news, and she was accused of being unkind to Winehouse. </p> <p>Cole is unrepentant. \"Her behaviour was being glorified. I was upset with the Grammys ... They took advantage of a young girl who's very ill. How can you tell someone they are sick and reward them at the same time?\"</p> <p>She reflects on the vilification that young female artists such as Britney Spears and Winehouse have received at the hands of the press. \"I remember what it was like to be under the microscope, I had some tabloid scrutiny, but I didn't have paparazzi stalking me.\" She thinks it would have hindered her recovery if she had. </p> <p>Cole is well aware of the long-term effects of addiction. In July she was diagnosed with hepatitis C, a potentially life-threatening virus caused by sharing needles decades ago. A strong dose of interferon has eradicated the virus for now, but she has to maintain the treatment.</p> <p>Over the years, Cole has moved closer and closer to the cool jazz sound immortalised by her father. Listening to his music used to be painful for her, but now it simply brings back fond memories. When she mixes her vocals with his - as she does again on this latest album - she finds it \"very gratifying. It feels like a tribute to a great man ... His phrasing is unique. It takes a minute to capture that, I had to study it. But what made me feel good is that I've inherited some of that ability. </p> <p>And I feel fortunate that he's left me so much great music.\" She gives a mischievous grin. These days, it seems, Cole is happy to be her father's daughter.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Still Unforgettable is released on Monday on Rhino/WEA.</p>",
  "<p>Hannah Lazenby, 29, a maternity nurse from Harrogate, has looked after dozens of babies over the past 10 years, usually from the day of their birth. She believes a simple black and white image can soothe any crying baby: \"It gives them something to concentrate on when they're bombarded by so many different images after the calm of the womb. This is something very simple that they're transfixed by - they can't take their eyes off it. I have had children who have been fractious or had colic and found myself thinking, 'You poor thing, I don't know what else to do, I'll give you this to look at.' And it does seem to work.\"</p> <p>This is not just guesswork on her part. There is apparently only one thing newborn babies would rather look at than these black and white pictures - the human face. So when they gaze at these pictures, what exactly are they looking at? We can't be sure, but most neuroscientists agree that they are transfixed by contrast. One theory is that this differentiation mimics the white-meets-colour effect of the thing the baby most wants to seek out: the eyes and mouth of the person who is going to feed them.</p> <p>For the past 20 years, experiments by neuroscientists have shown that babies do indeed home in on this type of image. The preference lasts from birth until about seven months. \"While babies can see from birth, their visual acuity is poor and they have problems changing their focus to near or far objects,\" explains Professor Mark Johnson of Birkbeck College's Centre for Brain and Cognitive Development in London, who has studied infant brains for two decades. \"This means that if something is not at an optimal distance for them - about 50cm - it will appear fuzzy and de-focused for the first few months. The limitations in babies' vision makes simple bold patterns with high-contrast boundaries more visible.\" By the time they are one year old, vision in babies is approximately similar to that of adults, he adds.</p> <p>Neuroscientists know babies seek out these images from simple preference experiments. They show babies pictures and note which ones their eyes are drawn to. Professor Usha Goswami, director of the Centre for Neuroscience in Education at Cambridge University, explains: \"Anything with very obvious contrast - such as black and white edges and lines - is an optimal stimulant for the visual system,\" she says. \"This type of stimulation basically gets the system up and running - but all images do this to a degree, not just black and white ones.\" We do not know yet whether babies see the same (whole) picture that adults see or whether they just focus on these lines and edges. Babies would be most likely to respond to any image that resembles a face, says Goswami,\"especially when the image is an actual human or a symmetric depiction.\"</p> <p>There is an evolutionary reason why they need to distinguish edges, says Dr Miriam Stoppard, author of Complete Baby and Childcare: \"Babies are born with the ability to see the face that is going to bring them food. They need to see a human face because that face is attached to the milk supply. They focus on the edges of the eyes and the mouth where there is a difference in contrast. And they learn to recognise their mother from other people because of the shape of where the hairline meets the forehead.\"</p> <p>Before I had children I had heard about this idea that babies are strangely drawn to contrast images. I dismissed it as a form of hot-housing as well as another lucrative opportunity for toy manufacturers to exploit. When my first child was born, I was given a mobile to hang above his cot with strange geometric black and white markings (and, come to think of it, some simplistic face pictures that Julian Opie's lawyers might be interested in). I thought it was ugly and useless. One day, in desperation when the baby was crying inconsolably, I held it above him. He fixated on the patterns, rapt and becalmed, as if they contained the meaning of the universe. Other objects did not have the same effect, so it was not just about distraction. It was definitely the freaky black and white pictures that did it.</p> <p>This is exactly the quasi-hypnotic effect Lazenby has observed repeatedly. One of her charges was the now three-year-old son of a contemporary art collector who has Opie's Sara Walking (a 2003 video installation of a black and white figure walking) on her kitchen wall. The baby was mesmerised by this artwork, she says: \"He was aware of it from the moment he came out of hospital at three days old. He was just always looking at it.\"</p> <p>Lazenby's views have inspired her art-collector employer, Yana Peel, the 34-year-old co-director of arts foundation Outset, to put together a book of images by artists including Kazimir Malevich, Bridget Riley, Josef Albers, Gary Hume and Takashi Murakami. Art for Baby is published next week and comes complete with a frieze to hang in the nursery. The collection includes Opie's Natasha (2000), a woman's face with two full stops for eyes, and Damien Hirst's Hypovase Prazosin Hydrochloride (1992), a grid of dots.</p> <p>\"Of course, we don't know what a baby is going to make of something like that,\" says Stoppard, \"but we do know that babies pick up very small details, particularly if you point them out and help them. Anything that encourages that instinct is good.\"</p> <p>While the science about contrast images is well-known, any long-term effect on babies of being exposed to these black and white images is untested. Lazenby says it has definitely furthered an interest in books and pictures in the babies she has looked after: \"You sit down in a cosy situation with your baby, sharing the book, and it turns into an experience they want to recreate. You're helping them learn to concentrate. I know toddlers who still look at these black and white images and like telling stories about them.\"</p> <p>Johnson adds: \"What scientific evidence does show is that babies are naturally attracted to look at and listen to things that benefit their own further brain development. Most parents naturally and spontaneously provide the right kinds of stimulation for their babies. One example is 'motherese' - the natural tendency to use sing-song and repetitive language when speaking to babies.\"</p> <p>Black and white picture books for newborns have been around for years - Lazenby always gives them to new parents as a present (\"They say, 'Where's the cute teddy bear?'\") - but this is the first time anyone has suggested babies might enjoy contemporary art. Although the project has a tongue-in-cheek feel (and is surely designed less for babies than for parents who want to get up to speed on contemporary art), as Stoppard puts it: \"If you are going to introduce images to your baby, why not introduce very good ones?\" Indeed, if you are going to put pictures up in the nursery, then why not a challenging Opie image instead of a hideous Teletubbies frieze? Perhaps putting a Malevich above the cot is no more pretentious than some faux vintage Babar poster. However, the project has limits, says Stoppard: \"Will it encourage an artistic temperament? No. That is going way too far.\"</p> <p>You have to wonder, meanwhile, exactly how flattering it is for these artists to discover that the people who might most profoundly understand their work are under the age of one. One art critic I spoke to, himself a parent, declined to comment on the project and refused to believe that babies could see any picture clearly before the age of eight months, let alone \"appreciate\" contemporary art. Opie does not seem to mind, though: \"Vision is, to a large extent, a learned thing,\" he says, \"and babies go through an important phase of looking and touching and learning to 'read' visually.\"</p> <p>One of the images in the book is Untitled, a giant white carrot on a black background by David Shrigley, the Glaswegian artist and cartoonist. He is delighted to have a new, young audience for his work. It's just a shame, he jokes, that the DVD of his latest animation, Who I Am and What I Want, is certificated 18. \"I'm not a parent but most of my friends have kids. Babies respond to really weird things in my experience. You can rattle your keys at them and they seem to find it entertaining. I'm not precious about my images. If very young eyes appreciate them, one should be flattered.\" </p> <p>Lazenby adds: \"Nothing can replace human interaction, and a smiley face and different facial expressions are still the best thing for a baby to see. But I really think these pictures also give them some kind of pleasure.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Art for Baby is published on October 2 by Templar, price \u00a314.99 (\u00a31.50 from each sale goes to the NSPCC).</p>",
  "<p>A good way to measure a thinktank's progress is by its premises. Between the 1950s and the 1970s, as the Institute of Economic Affairs built the intellectual foundations for Thatcherism in Britain, it moved across London from a basement in noisy Victoria to a few rooms in gracious Belgravia - to an entire Georgian house next to the power centres of Westminster. In recent years, the Conservatives and their associated thinkers have again been on an upward trajectory. One of the places this revival of the right is most obvious is at the offices of Policy Exchange.</p> <p>The thinktank closest to the government-in-waiting of David Cameron, a hothouse for many of its likely personnel, and the deviser of much of what the Conservatives are likely to do in office, Policy Exchange has for the six years of its short life been based in the same handsome street just off Parliament Square. Policy Exchange began with fewer than a dozen staff. But now it has three dozen: mostly eager young men in shirt-sleeves, deck shoes and cardigans; perennial Tory fashions mixed with something closer-fitting and more modern. They sit at banks of desks, tight together, typing fast even in the late afternoon on a Friday. The room is large and high-ceilinged, not a typical Westminster garret at all. Westminster Abbey glows through the long windows in the autumn sunshine.</p> <p>\"Policy Exchange have been very effective,\" says David Goodhart, editor of the political magazine Prospect. \"They have been really quite important in the Tory revival. They've helped to make the Tories sort of cool again intellectually.\" Geoff Mulgan, who co-founded the once equally potent thinktank Demos and did much of the early thinking for New Labour, says: \"They're quite lively, fresh, willing to take risks.\" The thinktank's website and frequent confident publications come with admiring quotes from senior Conservatives such as George Osborne (\"Policy Exchange has been a wellspring of new ideas\") and Oliver Letwin (\"Policy Exchange has become one of the seminal influences on political debate in Britain\").</p> <p>Anthony Browne, the thinktank's outgoing director, is a fast-talking, digressive man in a striped shirt. \"We keep being asked by civil servants to brief them on our reports,\" he says. He half-suppresses a smile: \"Until about a year ago it had never happened.\" Why does he think it is happening now? \"It might be that they think we're a proxy for the incoming government.\"</p> <p>In fact, a striking number of Policy Exchange people already are part of a new ruling elite. Next month Browne himself starts work as head of policy for the new Conservative mayor of London Boris Johnson. Nicholas Boles, Browne's predecessor as Policy Exchange director, is the Conservative candidate for Grantham and the head of the party's semi-secret Implementation Unit, which is drawing up the strategy for Cameron's first moves in government. Michael Gove, the shadow schools secretary, British neoconservative and another important ally of the Tory leader, was the thinktank's founding chairman. Francis Maude, the shadow cabinet office minister and influential Tory \"moderniser\", was also one of the thinktank's founders. James O'Shaughnessy, the Conservatives' director of policy and research, used to be the thinktank's head of research. Munira Mirza, Johnson's director of culture, and a prominent critic of what she calls the \"race relations industry\", was until recently one of the thinktank's writers. </p> <p>Beyond these much remarked-upon connections are a host of others. </p> <p>Cameron launched his campaign for the Tory leadership at Policy Exchange in 2005. Rachel Whetstone, the well-connected Conservative and partner of Steve Hilton, Cameron's strategist, is one of the thinktank's trustees. Even Policy Exchange's head of public relations, James Bethell, is a prospective Conservative parliamentary candidate.</p> <p>\"Policy Exchange is almost like the waiting room for the next Tory government,\" says a well-informed Conservative blogger and activist. \"Rightwing thinktanks do it in America during Democratic administrations. Look after personnel. Wait for a Republican government. Individuals can be tested at a thinktank who are not ready yet for a public role inside the party.\" A former Policy Exchange researcher is blunter: \"While I was there, a number of people arrived at Policy Exchange wanting to work for the Tories.\"</p> <p>Yet, even in these not very ideological times, a successful thinktank is about more than networking. It is also about ideas: having them, borrowing them, honing them, popularising them. In its publications and public statements, Policy Exchange has argued that business should run parts of the welfare state; that planning laws should be radically relaxed in favour of developers; that more power should be devolved to local communities; and that the Routemaster bus should return to the streets of London. It has suggested \"a doubling in size of the current motorway network\" and the lowering of fuel and road taxes. (Not exactly the green revolution the Tories have been promising recently.) It has celebrated Cameron-style \"compassionate conservatism\"; and condemned Labour's economic policies in exactly the same terms as Osborne, as \"more mirage than miracle\". It has called for the abolition of childcare tax credits. It has attacked the level of stamp duty paid by first-time housebuyers. It has doggedly criticised Ken Livingstone's record as mayor of London. And, most significantly perhaps for the overall direction of a Cameron government, it has advocated the free market as the answer to nearly everything, even now. </p> <p>Many of these stances have already become Conservative, and quite often Labour, orthodoxies over the last few years. \"James Purnell [the work and pensions secretary] came up to me at a CBI dinner,\" remembers Browne happily, \"and said, 'Anthony, Anthony, that was a really good report you did on welfare reform.'\" Browne's successor as Policy Exchange director, Neil O'Brien, is even keener to emphasise the thinktank's credentials as a supplier of what he calls \"centre-right\" ideas to politicians of all parties. </p> <p>During our interview he praises Tony Blair more than any other figure. </p> <p>Both O'Brien and Browne insist that the success of Policy Exchange is mainly down to the seriousness and conscientiousness of its output. From Policy Exchange's studiedly neutral, academic-sounding name, to the length of some of its pamphlets - 100 pages or more - to the muted, slightly technical language most of them are written in, with footnotes, graphics and bibliographies, the thinktank has worked strenuously to appear rational and moderate. </p> <p>But is it really? In August, Policy Exchange published a report on \"making urban regeneration work\", which claimed it would be \"desirable\" if large numbers of people left \"struggling\" northern English cities such as Bradford and Liverpool and moved to places in the south \"that offer better prospects\". The ensuing row lasted almost a week and drew in outraged northern newspapers and MPs and even Cameron himself, who that week was on a vote-seeking tour of the north of England and condemned the report as \"insane\" and \"rubbish from start to finish\".</p> <p>Browne still defends the pamphlet and its timing, but with a selection of not completely compatible arguments. \"It was published unwittingly on the day Cameron was going to start his tour,\" he begins. He frowns: \"We actually had an outside PR agency dealing with publication ...\" Then his frown disappears: \"That's what thinktanks are there to do - stir things up.\"</p> <p>The thinktank's relationship with the Conservatives did not suffer lasting damage. But in another policy area, to which Policy Exchange has repeatedly returned, there has been more protracted and serious controversy.</p> <p>Starting in July 2006, the first anniversary of the 7/7 bombings, Policy Exchange has published a series of pamphlets on the \"extremist\" strands of Islam and the threats it says they pose. In tone, these reports have been more aggressive than the thinktank's usual output. They have warned about Islamic \"reactionaries\", about \"the hijacking of British Islam\", about the \"subverting [of] mosques\". Since 7/7 and 9/11, such talk has become common in western countries, among some liberals as well as those on the right. Nevertheless, Policy Exchange's contributions to the debate have alarmed the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) and almost all Muslim groups and commentators. \"Policy Exchange is more than just a thinktank,\" says the MCB's spokesman Inayat Bunglawala. \"It is a clearly agenda-driven, anti-Muslim organization. It has consistently tried to promote an apolitical version of Islam. And it clearly does have influence. Anthony Browne being appointed as Boris Johnson's policy adviser was a tremendously alarming move.\"</p> <p>Another aspect of Policy Exchange's interest in Islam that concerns the MCB and others is that it has been overseen by Dean Godson, the thinktank's research director for \"terrorism and security\" and \"international\" subjects. His politics are considerably more hard-edged and dogmatic than those usually associated with Cameron's Conservatism. </p> <p>He is the son of Joseph Godson, a hawkish US diplomat and behind-the-scenes cold war player, and the brother of Roy Godson, the head of a rightwing Washington thinktank, prominent American conservative, and authority on political \"dirty tricks\" and \"black propaganda\". During the 1980s, both Roy and Dean Godson worked for Republican administrations in Washington. Afterwards, Dean became chief leader writer for the Daily Telegraph during its most pungently rightwing phase under the ownership of Conrad Black. Since joining Policy Exchange, Godson has continued to write polemics for British newspapers, often about Islam and often echoing the arguments of American neoconservatives.</p> <p>At the thinktank, he is a large presence. \"Dean's not fantastically easy to work with,\" says someone who worked there until recently. \"He talks very loudly in the open-plan. He calls you at 3am. He's very demanding. But he knows everyone in the UK and the US. He brings in a lot of donations. And he has lots of Muslim contacts on the ground.\" Browne says Godson is an independent and unpredictable operator: \"You can't tell Dean what to do. We've got three more reports coming up on Muslim subjects. One on the Bangladeshi community in the UK, which is very supportive. One on Muslim soldiers in the army, very supportive. One on Muslim women. All supervised by Dean Godson.\"</p> <p>Yet during 2006 and 2007 Godson oversaw a much more contentious Policy Exchange investigation, into the availability of \"extremist literature\" in British mosques. The report, published last October, alleged that such texts had been found by the thinktank's researchers at one mosque in every four. The revelation became a huge story - Policy Exchange has always been very good at publicity - including calls for a police investigation and David Cameron confronting King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, then on a visit to Britain, over his country's alleged sponsorship of much of the contentious material.</p> <p>But the reliability of the report's findings was quickly challenged. The BBC programme Newsnight, which had been planning to make a film about the report in collaboration with Policy Exchange, did some checks first and found that some of the mosques in question denied selling the literature. In addition, forensic research commissioned by Newsnight found that several of the receipts the Policy Exchange researchers claimed to have received for the literature appeared to have been forged. After a series of increasingly tense meetings between Newsnight and the thinktank - one of which was attended by a watchful senior aide of David Cameron's, Dougie Smith - Newsnight decided not to broadcast their film supporting the Policy Exchange report. Instead, the programme showed a long item laying out the doubts about the thinktank's report, and invited Godson to face Jeremy Paxman.</p> <p>Godson defended the report in its entirety, with a fierceness - he accused Newsnight of \"bottling out\", and Paxman of not being \"in command of the facts\" - that was either justified or very misjudged. Policy Exchange threatened legal action against Newsnight. In a letter to the BBC, the thinktank warned that it would \"pursue such litigation relentlessly to trial or capitulation by the corporation\".</p> <p>A year on, no such litigation has been forthcoming. Instead, this month, one of the mosques accused in the Policy Exchange report, the North London Central Mosque in Finsbury Park, has issued a claim against the thinktank for defamation and malicious falsehood. Policy Exchange has hired Princess Diana's former solicitors, Mishcon de Reya, to contest the claim which, if there is no settlement first, will come to court next year. In the meantime the thinktank, whose senior staff and trustees have until now defended the report, have been advised by their lawyers to make no further comment. </p> <p>Such dramas were probably not anticipated when Policy Exchange was founded in 2002. It began as a refuge for modernising Tories, soon after their first great hope, Michael Portillo, was defeated in his bid to become party leader in 2001. That summer, Portillo's campaign manager Francis Maude and another high-profile Tory moderniser, Archie Norman, announced they were setting up a \"thinktank with attitude\". Others saw it as a base for plotting against the party leadership. Either way, the organisation made an uncertain start, in keeping with the jittery mood of British Conservatism at the time. In its first few months the thinktank changed its name from Conservatives for Change to C-Change, to XChange, and finally Policy Exchange.</p> <p>The Tories were still deeply unpopular, and British rightwing thinktanks were not fashionable. Instead Policy Exchange took as its model the left-leaning Institute of Public Policy Research (IPPR). The IPPR had been set up when Labour was at a low ebb and had drawn astutely on sympathetic City and business donors. Its influential pamphlets were light on rhetoric and full of weighty-looking research, and its staff - including a young David Miliband - had gone on to greater things. The IPPR was also a charity, with all the financial advantages that implied. \"We basically borrowed the IPPR's claim for charitable status,\" says Browne, \"and changed the words 'centre-left' to 'centre-right'.\"</p> <p>Between 2002 and 2005, with Nicholas Boles as its director, Policy Exchange began to make a name for itself in the cloistered world of Westminster thinktanks. It dealt with subjects that the British right usually ignored except to make political capital, such as unemployment and life in prison. \"If you don't look at those problems, the solutions offered come from the left only,\" says O'Brien. </p> <p>At the same time Policy Exchange remained a place for Tory modernisers to gather, to learn and network, to make speeches and converts. Yet until well into 2005 the whole enterprise felt quite fragile. At times \"PX\", as the thinktank's staff and allies call it, \"felt kind of depressed,\" says someone who joined after the Conservatives had lost the 2005 general election. \"When Cameron launched his campaign at PX, there was a palpable sense that he had no chance at all. And that if he loses the Tories are fucked, and Policy Exchange is fucked.\"</p> <p>But he didn't lose, and Policy Exchange truly began to prosper. In the financial year 2004-5 its income was \u00a3584,000, according to accounts submitted to the Charity Commission. In 2006-7 it was \u00a31,585,000. Money comes in from trusts and foundations, from companies such as Microsoft, and from wealthy individuals. Unlike large donations to political parties, large donations to thinktanks, even one with close links to a particular party, are still allowed to be anonymous. </p> <p>\"We have a lot of connections in the City,\" says Browne. One trustee, George Robinson, is the cofounder of Sloane Robinson, one of Britain's most profitable hedge funds. In 2006-7 the area of research which attracted the most money was one of Dean Godson's specialities: \"security\".</p> <p>As a result of this healthy stream of donations, Policy Exchange researchers, hired soon after university, typically earn \u00a330,000 a year, compared with \u00a320,000 at other thinktanks. The thinktank also often uses outside specialists from academia. Browne is keen to mention that Professor Julian Le Grand of the London School of Economics, recently a guru to New Labour on \"choice\" in state services, is working with Policy Exchange on an upcoming report on education funding.</p> <p>Yet, in reality, the thinktank is a less scholarly operation than it likes to make out. Researchers largely \"learn on the job\", says a former one. Staff turnover is fast. As I am interviewing Browne and O'Brien at their boardoom table, there is a burst of applause from the next room. \"What's that?\" says Browne to O'Brien. O'Brien, who is slightly less donnish and distracted in his manner, says that someone is leaving. \"I didn't know that,\" Browne mutters to himself. Policy Exchange publications have a mixed reputation among public policy professionals. \"They seem to lack something in the quality control department,\" says a public health expert who has attended their seminars. \"They seem to swing between making reasonably sensible analyses and some completely barmy, ill-thought-out ideas which would have been best left on the editing-room floor.\"</p> <p>Dr Marie Breen-Smyth, director of the Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Contemporary Political Violence at Aberystwyth University, is also critical of Policy Exchange's research on Islam, and their methodology in general. \"I have some concerns about the robustness of the work,\" she says. \"They are not professional researchers. A proper academic would have to put their technical data, their methodology, in the public domain. Policy Exchange don't. They can't have it both ways. Either they are professional researchers, with ethical responsibilities. Or they are political pundits.\"</p> <p>Browne strongly defends the quality of Policy Exchange's output: \"We have a lot of top professors phoning up asking to work for us. We are not just doing some pamphleteering nonsense.\" </p> <p>Another criticism of Policy Exchange comes from Richard Cockett, author of Thinking the Unthinkable, an acclaimed history of the crusading postwar Thatcherite thinktanks such as the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA) and the Centre for Policy Studies (CPS). \"You could say Policy Exchange are not bold enough,\" he says. \"The IEA and the CPS were set up by a bunch of mavericks. They really were trying to change the world. They were at war with the Conservative party hierarchy. It's very different with Policy Exchange. These guys are all quite young. They want to make a career in politics. They move smoothly into the party.\"</p> <p>As with Cameron's Conservatives, the conventionally rightwing nature of many of Policy Exchange's ideas, for all its recent political momentum and smart presentation, may leave the thinktank vulnerable to changing times. I interviewed Browne and O'Brien a week ago, amid the stock market chaos, as George Bush's once fiercely free-market government was making its panicky preparations to regulate and nationalise. I asked them if what had been happening on Wall Street and in the City had made think again at all about the free market. Browne looked slightly uncomprehending. \"Financial services are quite heavily regulated already,\" he said. \"You don't need to bury the financial services industry under a mountain of regulation.\" But didn't the failure of the banks have wider implications for deregulated capitalism? \"Just because there's been a crisis in the financial sector doesn't mean it's any less of a good thing to have competitive markets in welfare provision.\" The Conservatives have reacted to the crisis in a similar way so far.</p> <p> Over its six-year existence Policy Exchange has published little on economics, not even in the year since the start of the credit crunch. \"They and the other rightwing thinktanks seem stuck in a traditional, pro-market, pro-business stance,\" says Mulgan. </p> <p>\"I don't think they've had anything to say about sub-prime.\" </p> <p>O'Brien will be 29 when he takes over at Policy Exchange next month. He has a background in City PR and in running a small Eurosceptic thinktank, Open Europe. He was not even a teenager the last time there was a recession. He is more of a listener than his predecessor, and slightly less bullish about the prospects for the British right. \"I don't think a Tory government is a given,\" he says carefully. But if there is one, he'll probably need to hire some more staff.</p> <h2>Five ideas from Policy Exchange</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Encourage people to abandon struggling northern cities </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Bring back the Routemaster bus in London</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Attack Ken Livingstone and get Boris Johnson elected as mayor of London</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Let the public nominate ugly buildings for demolition</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Cut up the green belt</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Monday September 29 2008.

  "<p>It doesn't cost much to snap up a house these days in the down-at-heel motor city of Detroit. Agents advertise two-bedroom properties for as little as $1,500 (\u00a3800). \"It's a phenomenon that's unreal that's going on at the moment,\" said Lolita Haley, owner of Prime Financial Plus Realty in suburban Detroit. \"Foreclosed homes are constantly coming on to the market.\"</p> <p>In cities throughout America's heartland, the crisis-stricken housing market is worsening by the day as struggling families abandon property because they are unable to keep up mortgage payments. </p> <p>Some 6.41% of US home loans are in arrears - the highest figure since records began in 1979 - according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. More than 2 million Americans lost their homes to foreclosure last year and the figure is set to be far higher in 2008. Last month alone, repossession papers were filed on 303,879 properties.</p> <p>As politicians in Congress thrashed out the details of the Bush administration's $700bn bailout plan for the banking industry, homeowners protested outside congressional offices yesterday.</p> <p>The Neighbourhood Assistance Corporation of America, which helps people to negotiate with lenders, has derided the rescue package as the \"leave no banker behind\" plan, and is demanding a moratorium on repossessions.</p> <p>\"Washington is about to reward Wall Street and predatory lenders for their greed and irresponsible lending tactics which created the mortgage crisis,\" said Naca's chief executive, Bruce Marks. \"We cannot let this pass without help for the millions of homeowners at risk of foreclosures.\"</p> <p>The worst-hit regions in the crisis fall into two categories. There are states that were already economically deprived, such as Mississippi, Michigan and Ohio, where job losses have made it tough for people to keep up mortgage repayments. Then there are relatively well-off areas in Florida, Nevada and California where a particularly aggressive housing boom collapsed catastrophically, leaving millions of people with mortgages far higher than the value of their homes.</p> <p>In several cities, foreclosure bus tours do a steady trade, taking sightseers and potential investors to gawp at bank-owned properties. A Boston estate agent, John Pace, operates a bus tour every other weekend. \"It's a tough situation. You'd rather see someone living in these houses than them vacant,\" he said.</p> <p>In parts of California, more than half of all home sales are of bank-owned property. East of San Francisco, the city of Stockton has the highest foreclosure rate in the US. City authorities are struggling to cope with vandalism and neglect, as hundreds of homes are abandoned every month. </p> <p>There are fears that the West Nile virus could spread aggressively as mosquitoes breed in the stagnant water of swimming pools at bank-owned homes. In San Diego, pest control officers have seen a surge in calls to deal with bees and wasps which are nesting undisturbed in vacant houses.</p> <p>One sign of hope, according to some, is that the monthly increase in foreclosures has slowed. Filings last month were only up 27% year-on-year, compared with rises of 60% to 65% in previous months, said RealtyTrac, which compiles a national database. But the fall is largely due to legislation in many states which has made eviction a longer process, rather than any reflection of a genuine market improvement. In worst-hit regions, courts are struggling to keep up with a backlog of foreclosure paperwork.</p> <p>Those on the ground doubt that the Bush administration's banking bailout will chime agreeably with struggling families. Drew Sygit, a property consultant at The Lending Edge in Detroit, said: \"I don't know if anyone in the Detroit area cares, or can see that this package is supposed to be in their best interests. For many people, it's a case of, 'Hey, I lost my house and some of the people who put us in this situation are being bailed out',\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>Russia launched an investigation yesterday into the assassination on Wednesday night of Ruslan Yamadayev, a former MP and bitter rival of Chechnya's pro-Kremlin president Ramzan Kadyrov.</p> <p>He was shot dead early in the evening outside the British embassy in central Moscow. His Mercedes had stopped at a red traffic light when his assailant opened fire from an Audi car. Yamadayev, 46, died instantly and his passenger, a former military commander in Chechnya, Sergei Kizyun, was seriously wounded. The killer escaped, driving off along the river embankment and past the White House.</p> <p>Yamadayav's extended family has been involved in a bitter clan feud with Kadyrov, and represented one of the few sources of genuine opposition to the president inside the unstable Caucasus republic. </p> <p>His brother, Sulim Yamadayev, a former Chechen rebel, was involved in a standoff with Kadyrov in April when his convoy refused to yield when the president tried to drive past. Several people were reportedly killed in an ensuing gun battle. The president issued a warrant for his arrest, accusing him and his family of murder, torture and other crimes.</p> <p>Yesterday another Yamadayev brother alleged that the Chechen president was behind Wednesday's night's assassination in Moscow. Isa Yamadayev told the newspaper Kommersant: \"Our family has information that he [Kadyrov] was preparing a reprisal.\" Kadyrov denied involvement. A spokeswoman, Lema Gudayev, told Interfax: \"He was shocked to learn about this. It is well known that Kadyrov's position was that a court should find out what crimes the brothers have committed and make a decision on their responsibility.\"</p> <p>Kadyrov, who became Chechen president in February 2007, has previously been accused of the murder of the campaigning journalist Anna Politkovskaya. Politkovskaya, an outspoken critic of his, was shot dead outside her Moscow apartment in October 2006. </p> <p>According to Russian media reports, investigators are examining several theories. These include that Ruslan was the victim of a mistaken identity, and that the real target was Sulim. They are also examining whether the killing may have been linked to his casino business in Moscow.</p> <p>Ruslan Yamadayev fought against the Russian army during Chechnya's separatist war in the 1990s, but defected to the Kremlin side during the second war, which began in 1999. President Vladimir Putin rewarded his loyalty with a \"hero of Russia\" award in 2004. Yamadayev was also made a member of the Duma and served until 2007 as a member of Putin's United Russia party.</p>",
  "<p>It was as if the launch of Oh Boy! in September 1958 was timed as my treat at the end of a testing first week at grammar school. A reluctantly short-trousered 11-year-old, I owned the beginnings of a record collection - Little Richard and Lonnie Donegan 78s; Crickets, Fats Domino, and Everly Brothers EPs - and had already intuited that if Tommy Steele was Britain's answer to Elvis Presley, then, as some wag put it, we must have misheard the question.</p> <p>I'd seen Steele on Saturday evening's 6.5 Special and sensed something equally hokey about the BBC's flagship teen show: the cable-knit jollity of a church youth club, with hosts Pete Murray and Jo Douglas as the would-be with-it vicar and his wife, both blithely clueless as to what appealed to young people. All we wanted was rock'n'roll, not a hotchpotch of jazz, skiffle, classical, choirs and crooners, never mind the comedy, sport and eggy interview slots.</p> <p>More than three years on from Rock Around the Clock, the music fanfared by that record had fallen short of undisputed pre-eminence and, through the months leading to Oh Boy!'s launch, the pop papers bristled with articles bashing the big beat. Melody Maker's curmudgeonly Steve Race was not alone in railing against \"that particular kind of infantile and often suggestive chanting known as 'rock'n'roll'\", while the Methodist minister Donald Soper, deploring \"the undue emphasis on sex in so many songs\" and calling for censorship to shore up artistic and moral standards, claimed, \"I watch 6.5 Special sometimes - as a penance. I'm perplexed. I can't understand how intelligent people can derive any sort of satisfaction from something which is emotionally embarrassing and intellectually ridiculous.\" He could have been having a dig at 6.5 Special producer Jack Good, whose intelligence, vouched by an Oxford degree, had not blinded him to the effervescent glory of rock'n'roll.</p> <p>In fact, Good had quit the programme - and the frustrations of the BBC - early in 1958 and begun almost at once to plan a music show for the rival commercial network, unencumbered by the baggage that too often slowed 6.5 Special to a stumble. This was to be his masterpiece: a spell-binding visualisation - through movement, camerawork and lighting - of rock'n'roll.</p> <p>Good, then 27, played a part in the birth of British rock'n'roll that was more than that of a TV impresario. He was mentor to Marty Wilde, who had appeared on 6.5 Special. It was Good who introduced Wilde to the American singer Jody Reynolds' Endless Sleep, Wilde's cover of which brought him his first hit in July 1958 and remained a top five fixture the week Oh Boy! began.</p> <p>Good could spot homegrown hits, too, inking Cliff Richard for the opening show the moment he flipped the 17-year-old's first single and heard Move It. \"This disc could sell 50,000 copies on its first eight bars alone,\" he enthused in his Disc column in August 1958. \"Even as I play it over again for the hundred and first time, I still can't believe it. That this disc comes from Britain and not the States is fantastic - absurd. If this is not a hit, I have never heard one.\"</p> <p>While I was finding my feet in class 2C, Cliff Richard, Marty Wilde and the regulars recruited for Oh Boy! - house band Lord Rockingham's XI, wide-eyed Cherry Wainer with her upholstered Hammond organ, Leicester doo-woppers the Dallas Boys, and the leggy Vernons Girls - were rehearsing at an Islington club, where every movement, every look was minutely observed through the producer's owlish lenses. Richard, clearly in the thrall of Elvis, wore sideboards and an acoustic guitar slung across his chest. Shaping his hands in front of his face to approximate a TV screen, Good studied the young singer, and made a note to have a word with him.</p> <p>The next day, Keith Goodwin interviewed the debutant for the NME. Richard, he reported, \"set about telling me of his sudden attack of nerves. 'It's wonderful to be going on TV for the first time, but I feel so nervous that I don't know what to do. I mean, I only turned professional five weeks ago, and before that I was working as a clerk and only playing at local dances and things in my spare time. I wore sideburns then, but I shaved them off last night - Jack thought it would make me look more original. I think he's right.'\" </p> <p>\"Make no mistake,\" Richard insists 50 years later, \"Jack Good was the boss. He was totally in control, always. Unless he permitted it, you couldn't do it! I've said many times that it was Jack who created the beginnings of Cliff Richard. He didn't want an Elvis lookalike, so off came the sideburns, away went the guitar, and in came the sneer, the curled lip, and that sultry look up at the camera. I was 100% directed by him but, oh boy, did he know what he was doing.\"</p> <p>Oh Boy! was screened live, with a five-minute start on 6.5 Special, from the Hackney Empire in east London, whose stage was overhung with spotlights to generate dazzling chiaroscuro effects: circles of stark white light across which danced angular black shadows cast by the singers, each gyration mirrored in negative monochrome, intensifying the screams - already whipped to crescendo during Good's frenetic warm-up - from the teeming balcony.</p> <p>There was a host - Tony Hall one week, Jimmy Henney the next - but no waffle; songs chased songs relentlessly, many condensed into medleys to maximise the output. And he scale of Good's production was cinematic. Performers were backed by as many as 30 supporting musicians and singers, the ensemble urged on from the wings by the inexhaustible producer.</p> <p>Good's preparation was never less than meticulous, as Marty Wilde confirms. \"I don't know anyone else who would have spent the time that he did. He would rehearse for hours and hours and hours to get things right, and it really paid off. He produced, he directed, and people like myself, Cliff and Billy Fury would have gone to the ends of the earth for him. If he'd have said, 'Boys, at the weekend we're jumping from the cliffs of Dover,' we'd have gone, and we'd have jumped, because we believed in him totally.\"</p> <p>When he wasn't framing shots with his hands, Good was plotting sequences on paper. \"He would have a pencil and a board,\" Wilde explains, \"and he would draw a square, shade it in and say, 'I'm going to shoot under your jaw here, and this is what it'll look like, then here, I want you to look slightly to your right, and the camera will be there, and I want you to look down.' He would tell you where the camera was going to be and what he planned to do with it.\"</p> <p>\"Television was just black-and-white in those days, of course,\" Richard points out, \"but the dramatic effect you could achieve with white light stabbing through the blackness was stunning. Frantic, fast-moving camera shots reinforced the excitement, which produced something totally new for the small screen. Nothing had been done like it before - and again it was entirely Jack Good's doing.\"</p> <p>Vernons Girl Joyce Baker, who would become Joyce Wilde when she married Marty in 1959, and later Kim's mum, highlights another aspect of Good's production: \"Jack would have some marvellous idea about a hit song someone had sent from America, and he'd get the girls to do dance routines around that song. He'd pick a couple of girls out to do an Everly Brothers number or whatever, and the others would be like a backdrop.\" Marty Wilde agrees: \"Jack would often pick up songs that weren't high in the American charts, he'd just pick out something that he really liked. He had amazing foresight in that direction really. He would pick out a song and say, 'This is going to be great.'\" So, on the opening show, Wilde sang the Leiber-Stoller rocker, Baby I Don't Care, Ricky Nelson's new UK hit, Poor Little Fool, and Buddy Knox's Somebody Touched Me.</p> <p>\"What we did was, in essence, very simple: we presented the charts to people,\" says Richard. \"The UK couldn't get Elvis or Jerry Lee or Conway Twitty, so we did their music for them - and everyone was a winner. The fans happily accepted covers of US hits from their favourite UK pin-ups, music publishers were thrilled to have their material promoted here, and there were certainly no complaints from the original American stars, who saw their record royalties increase on the back of soaring UK popularity.\"</p> <p>By November, the show's nationwide popularity, which would soon prompt the BBC to drop 6.5 Special for the brazen Oh Boy! clone, Dig This!, was confirmed when Lord Rockingham's XI's Hoots Mon topped the charts, but the protectors of public morality continued to keep watch. \"Producer Jack Good must be held responsible for permitting the most crude exhibitionism ever seen on British TV - by Cliff Richard last Saturday,\" harrumphed the NME's Alley Cat columnist in December. \"His violent hip-swinging during an obvious attempt to copy Elvis Presley was revolting - hardly the kind of performance any parent could wish their children to witness.\" In unapologetic protest that this show had been singled out, the singer claimed cheekily, \"After all, I'm always sexy,\" while Good's response was to book him as often as he could, and it was inevitable that Oh Boy!'s most sensational discovery should perform the closing number - a duet with Marty Wilde - of the 38th and final show on May 30 1959.</p> <p>A second series was anticipated in September 1959, but by then both name and format had changed. Although Boy Meets Girls disappointingly abandoned the breathless pace and brio of Oh Boy!, it didn't stop Good making British heroes of Eddie Cochran and Gene Vincent, a cheery Southerner whom he spectacularly transformed into a brooding, leather-clad Richard III.</p> <p>Wham! followed in 1960, but the upbeat exclamation mark could not disguise the truth that pop was in the doldrums, and in 1962 Good moved to the States \"for a year\" that stretched to many more.</p> <p>Time crawled through my teens, and it seemed a lifetime later that I saw the Rolling Stones in the back room of a Windsor pub, and yet it was less than four years on from Oh Boy! This was British R&amp;B, a new beginning, and by August 1963 it had spawned its own music show, which I watched across the ironing board as I pressed my tab-collar shirt and John Stephen strides before heading into an amphetamine-fuelled night, but not even the iconic Ready Steady Go! could surpass the feverish excitement of Oh Boy!</p> <p>Richard says: 'Make no mistake, it was Jack who created the beginnings of Cliff Richard'</p>",
  "<p>Professor Roger Matthews is Britain's leading academic expert on street prostitution, so his views should be listened to with respect (Letters, September 24). But Jacqui Smith's proposed new measures to make men take responsibility for the huge increase in women being coerced to have paid-for sex with men do not challenge his argument or proposals. Rather they begin to address the problem of the 18,000 women, often young girls, trafficked into Britain as sex slaves. </p> <p>It has always been a puzzle why so many men (and, to be fair, some women) reject the idea of controlling the growing demand side of sex-slave trafficking or the abuse of prostituted women. In a Commons debate in the summer, it was curious to hear the Conservative party speakers say they rejected action to curb or control demand. I am all for measures to disrupt the trafficking of sex slaves, but until men accept or are made to accept some responsibility for the sex they believe they have a human right to obtain via payment, it is hard to see any reduction in the number of prostituted women and the abuse, including terrible violence, that many suffer. I wish the home secretary had gone further, but she has been brave in facing down Whitehall opposition.<br><strong>Denis MacShane MP</strong><br>Lab, Rotherham</p>",
  "<p><strong>What is this bailout?</strong></p> <p>The US authorities, led by treasury secretary Henry Paulson, want to put up $700bn of taxpayers' money to buy toxic sub-prime mortgage debt from troubled banks in order to get them lending to each other and ordinary Americans again. They hope this will in turn prevent further bank failures.</p> <p><strong>When was it proposed?</strong></p> <p>The plan was put forward a week ago after the tumultuous few days which saw Lehman collapse and insurance giant AIG rescued by the government because it was considered too big to fail. But the bailout got bogged down in Congress, where the Democrats control both houses. Paulson had told congressmen they must approve the deal by today because Congress rises until after the presidential election in November.</p> <p><strong>Why has the process been so slow?</strong></p> <p>Many Democrats are wary of throwing another huge dollop of public money to bail out rich bankers, especially as the government has already used huge sums to nationalise mortgage giants Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, and AIG. Democrats wanted the plan altered. One demand, for example, was that the government would take a stake in each bank in which it bought toxic assets, enabling it to share in any future profits in an upturn and to keep a lid on executive pay at those institutions. Some Republicans were also against it on the grounds that public intervention in free markets is a bad thing.</p> <p><strong>What would happen if it fails? </strong></p> <p>In all likelihood, more bank collapses and further piles of public money spent nationalising institutions which the treasury and Federal Reserve think are crucial to the economy. </p> <p><strong>Why not just let shareholders in banks take the hit?</strong></p> <p>US taxpayers are caught between a rock and a hard place. Many shareholdings in banks are the pension funds of ordinary Americans. So if people save money as taxpayers by a bank being allowed to fail, they may well lose value in their pensions. There is no painless solution to this.</p> <p><strong>Will the bailout help the economy? </strong></p> <p>Yes, it should, to some extent. But it is not guaranteed. The problems in the US banking system are deep and, while $700bn sounds a lot of money, it pales into insignificance as a percentage of the US economy. Everything depends upon how it affects confidence in the system.</p> <p><strong>How bad is the American economy?</strong></p> <p>Bad, and getting worse. Yesterday saw more bad news, especially from the housing market. Falling US house prices are at the root of the whole sub-prime crisis. New home sales crashed 11.5% in August to a 17-year low of 460,000. The bailout could earn banks a breather, but the housing market remains in a terrible state, which will continue to have knock-on effects on consumer spending and confidence. Other data out yesterday was equally grim. So-called \"durable goods\" orders to American factories last month suffered their biggest fall since December 2002. And weekly jobless claims rose to their highest level since just after September 11 2001. Economists say that now the effect of the Bush tax cuts is fading, the US economy is likely heading into recession.</p>",
  "<p>This year's soggy summer has been especially dispiriting for Londoner Patrick Kane. For whenever it rained, his television, broadband and telephone services packed up. Only during the rare glimmers of sunshine could he watch a football match or phone his elderly mother in Scotland. Over the past 18 months Kane has been trying to persuade Virgin Media, which provides the combined services, to take an interest in his plight, but, although a technician did eventually fix the broadband, Kane still had to check the weather forecast to plan his phoning and viewing. Kane estimates that he has spent more than 100 hours calling Virgin's premium-rate technical support line and customer services without ever having received a return call. \"In June we had a medical emergency. It was raining, so no dial tone,\" he says. \"Nor was there a signal on my Virgin mobile. One of the most disturbing things is that they cannot divert my incoming calls to my mobile unless my landline is working, which it isn't, whereas with BT this is a standard procedure.\" </p> <p>Technicians came and went, but always on sunny days when the line was working. I contact Virgin's press office in August and am told that Kane's problem has been sorted to his satisfaction. However, it's not until the following day that Kane receives his first ever call from the company, and it's a further couple of days before the fault is actually diagnosed and repaired. He has now accepted a \u00a355 refund for his line rental and a written apology. \"All Virgin customers should keep their own records because Virgin's record-keeping is shoddy,\" he says. \"I've had to initiate contact and actively manage the repairs. They are not very good at communication - their engineers turn up without spares, instructions, equipment or willingness to do the job; their customer services are robotic in their response. The first time they ever contacted me was after the Guardian's call, so we should raise a cheer for a free press!\"</p>",
  "<p>I am often asked if I have ever been in a film that I believe changed people's lives. Away From Her did, maybe - but the one I am sure about is The Animals Film, which I narrated for its director, Victor Schonfeld, more than 25 years ago, and which revealed on film for the first time all the different ways in which we abuse animals.</p> <p>It's hard to quantify the impact the film had at the time. The late Alan Brien, in his review in the Sunday Times, wrote: \"I do not know when I have come out of a screening so moved by the power of the cinema as a medium to transform the entire sensibility of an audience.\" It was applauded when it was shown at the London film festival, and Channel 4 outbid the BBC to have it shown in its first week of broadcasting. Since then, it has been shown around the world, sometimes leading to changes in law. Many people who watched it became vegetarian. Many more, myself included, completely changed their consuming habits, according to whether their purchases involved animal testing or not.</p> <p>Because the message of the film was so powerful, there is a tendency to forget the film-making skill it involved. Victor realised that you could not present unmitigated horror for two hours, so he interspersed the remarkable expos\u00e9s of factory farming and animal experimentation with cartoons and vox pops, while Robert Wyatt and David Byrne lent their wonderful music to it. Twenty-five years later, it stands up as a major documentary, in the tradition of films such as Harlan County USA, the 1977 documentary directed by Barbara Kopple about the plight of American miners. Victor's film really was a breakthrough for this kind of documentary-making. Like the best documentaries - like the best films of any kind - it was illuminating.</p> <p>But what long-term effect did the film have? Since it was made, some things have changed in Britain, through campaign pressure, public opinion, education and legislation. Many of these changes stem, I am sure, from the film's exposure of the extent to which animal cruelty is involved in all aspects of our lives. For instance, in the early 1980s when the film was made, you would have been lucky to lay your hands on free-range eggs or meat; and never, ever would you have imagined that, owing to public demand, supermarkets would stock humanely reared dairy products. The cruelty-free movement has grown to such an extent, and its lobbying become so effective, that the testing of cosmetic products on animals is now banned in the UK - a big step forward.</p> <p>However, horrific animal cruelty is still part of the foundation on which we build our comfortable lives in the west, and will be so as long as we continue to demand massive quantities of cheap meat. Only through factory farming can this craving be satisfied, and the issue has tended to slip from view since the film was made. Thank goodness for the emergence of a new kind of animal-rights campaigning - personality- and television-driven, to suit our times - exemplified by the efforts of people such as Jamie Oliver and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall. People are again being reminded that the chicken we eat is not actually born on a polystyrene tray wrapped in clingfilm. As with everything, education is the key - we learned about Corn Belts and Rice Bowls at school, but never how the animals we eat reach our plates. It suits the agricultural industries to keep us ignorant, and as long as corporations pursue profit at any cost and human beings refuse to recognise the sensibilities of all species, we have a very, very long way to go. Victor's film reminds us of the journey made so far - and encourages us to continue on it.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Animals Film is released on DVD on September 29</p>",
  "<p>I wouldn't normally discourage people from reading this column, but anyone suffering cold feet as they contemplate their imminent wedding, or starting to wonder whether marriage was a mistake, should look away now. Pop music has a freakish ability to infect our moods and pierce our souls: songs buoy us when love is new and life seems joyful, then gnaw at our deepest fears about a relationship, making problems seem irremediable. And while not all songs about marriage ooze cynicism and disillusionment, this playlist does.</p> <p>It's hard not to wax cynical when real life instructs that romantic visions of conjugal bliss cannot be trusted. The shimmering optimism of the Dixie Cups' Chapel of Love, for instance, is undercut by the knowledge that the marriage between the song's writers, Jeff Barry and Ellie Greenwich, lasted three years. Similarly, Shania Twain's celebration of everlasting love, You're Still the One, soured when she and her husband separated earlier this year.</p> <p>Still, all marriages - and playlists on the subject - must start with hope, preferably tempered by realism. Such is the mood of We've Only Just Begun, an exquisite picture of a young couple excited by the future yet aware how much work a marriage requires. Peggy Lee is even more restrained as she quietly dreams of the house, children and companionship to come.</p> <p>Sadly, with the house comes the mortgage, with children comes merciless responsibility: spouses must fight to survive life's numbing banalities. Amy Rigby's character may want love to be stronger than the \"diaper pails\", \"doctor bills\" and \"tired jokes\", yet divorce looms inexorably on the song's horizon. (Unsurprisingly, Rigby had divorced not long before writing it.) In six devastating lines comparing married and single life, the Carter Family deliver an irrefutable argument for never settling down. Desaparecidos' depressing picture of a disintegrating couple opens, tellingly, with the despondent woman trying to look like she did \"when I was single\".</p> <p>What is the secret of the couples who do last? Using the metaphor of a tattered shirt, Mary Chapin Carpenter suggests it is the tiny triumphs over adversity, and even the irritations and disappointments that are forgiven and resolved, that glue people together. Chuck Berry winningly reminds us that a shared love of \"rock, rhythm and jazz\" never goes amiss. Abasing yourself as a blind fool, as Nick Cave does, may help. Whether a woman as magnanimous as that in Gangsta Wife actually exists is moot, but the profuse apologies for disgraceful behaviour that hip-hop duo Dirty lay at her feet could possibly keep her around.</p> <p>Ultimately, marriage - how it works, why it doesn't - is one of life's great mysteries. There's only one thing certain: you marry, you acquire new relations - potentially more annoying than your own. Ernie K-Doe's Mother-in-Law is an archetypal monster; mine, I hasten to add, is nothing like her.</p> <h2>This week's playlist</h2> <p><strong>1.

  "<p>This issue/episode/whatevs of Lost in Showbiz shall be a solemn meditation on the subject of What Else Can Your Celebrity Do? Because it's not good enough, is it, for them just to do whatever it is they became famous for. Dance for me, loser, dance! </p> <p>Celebrities want you to know that they don't \"just\" act, they don't \"just\" model: there is so much more depth beneath those shallow pools. Those who lack the foreign policy nous of Middle East diplomat Jude Law hire underlings to design clothing ranges because they've always been - self-deprecating chuckle - obsessed with fashion. Others go on reality TV shows where they will do such extraordinary things as wear no makeup and cry and be stuck in a room with Sue Perkins for a while. And then some celebrities turn to the internet.</p> <p>MySpace has, of course, served as a most excellent forum for celebrities to get their all-too-often stifled voices out into the world, with Lindsay Lohan and Lily Allen being probably the most frequently heard, although Leonardo DiCaprio's page (\"I am an actor and an environmental activist\") is occasionally worth checking out, too. </p> <p>One really needs to go to tomcruise.com in person to see a true messiah complex in action, and also, of course, to read the \"message from Tom\" (\"There are so many more stories to be told\" - oh Tom, aren't there just.)</p> <p>But a new standard has been set this week by Gwyneth Paltrow and the launch of her website, <a href=\"http://www.Goop.com\">Goop.com</a>.</p> <p>To give you a bit of recent Paltrow context, Lost in Showbiz was privileged - nay, blessed - to watch her on Oprah Winfrey last week. Admittedly the descriptions of her daily workouts with a personal trainer were just fascinating but I think the most thrilling moment was when Gwyneth discussed her friendship with Madonna, which Lost in Showbiz always hoped might develop into a kind of Thelma and Louise scenario. Anyway, Madonna \"has an amazing dichotomy\" (huh, shouldn't she get a cream for that?) and is \"such an intelligent person\". How intelligent, Gwyneth? \"She really rearranged my molecules.\" Blow me, even those idiots at Cern couldn't manage that one. Oh, and Madonna's kids are \"just phenomenal\". How so? \"Well, they're just really polite.\"</p> <p>And now, via the medium of the interweb, Gwyneth has, to her extraordinary credit, found a way to be even more annoying. This is not some poxy \"here's my CV\" website. No, Gwynnie wants to help you - you dumpy, gross, animal-fat-injesting freaks - be more pure like her. Excited already! </p> <p>Launching this week, the intriguingly named Goop.com will teach you how to \"nourish what is real\". Learn from Gwyneth, is the motto here, and who wouldn't want to? Why, in her mission statement she assures us, \"I love being in spaces that are clean and feel nice.\" It's like sitting at the knee of Thomas Aquinas. </p> <p>Best of all is the promise that Gwyneth will share \"some thoughts from one of my sages\". Gwyneth's sages! And people say the internet is just full of half-assed crap. Obviously, Lost in Showbiz has already signed up for the newsletter because if there's any woman who can help this column \"nourish the inner aspect\", then you just know it's going to be a woman who had to be hospitalised this year while it was reported that she was on a five-day fast. Oh, how my inner aspect feels so nourished already.</p>",
  "<p>\"You can't beat the market.\" That one slogan epitomises the conventional wisdom that has prevailed since the 1970s. This week, however, the US government convinced Congress that it was right, and the market was wrong. The treasury secretary, Henry Paulson, pleaded with representatives to hand over $700bn to buy securities that private investors have decided are worthless in the hope of rescuing banks saddled with the toxic assets. Charged with throwing good money after bad, the authorities insisted that market prices were wrong, arguing that taxpayers can expect to turn a profit when prices return to an appropriate value.</p> <p>Only days ago this pitch would have been treated as dangerous heresy, dismissed as reflecting the delusion that the bureaucracy knows best. The times, however, are a-changing. After the collapse of one bank and the fire-sale of others, the real delusion turns out to be blind faith in laissez-faire. On Wednesday the US president took to the airwaves to warn that avoiding economic Armageddon relied on securing the scheme. There are moments, in the words of one acute observer of capitalism, when all that is solid melts into air. Previously entrenched ideas are now evaporating fast, and the signs last night were that Congress had bought the deal - but only after much horse trading which had further diluted the purity of America's free-market system.</p> <p>Conservatives represented one half of the unholy Congressional alliance that initially frustrated the plan. The rightwing senator Richard Shelby complained that it took the US down the road of dirigiste France. Progressives populated another flank of resistance. They were reluctant to write blank cheques for the rich; a reluctance reinforced by news that the bankruptcy courts had released $2.5bn to secure Lehman Brothers bonus payments at a time when savers are still losing out. But the opportunity cost of the bail-out was the biggest sticking point. The $700bn bill represents a quarter of a full year's federal revenue, a vast outlay which will constrain the capacity of a potential Barack Obama presidency to deliver on priorities such as healthcare. Mr Obama and his Republican rival, John McCain, yesterday held a joint meeting with President Bush to project a united response to the economic peril. But Mr Obama was quite right to reject Mr McCain's calls to postpone planned debates between them until the financial deal was brokered. Its brokering was, quite properly, a highly political business.</p> <p>Despite yesterday's surge in shares, this week's record interbank lending rates are a reminder that finance is beset by a perilous lack of confidence. The system could come crashing down and, if it did, cleaners and cooks would feel the pain as much as wealthy bankers. But a great deal turns on the emerging small print of the deal. Hand in hand with help for holders of bad mortgage debt, there must be assistance for mortgage borrowers facing foreclosure. The fantastically vague Paulson scheme needed fleshing out to ensure it did not exempt reckless financial managers from punishment. After all, as the US economist Allan Meltzer has argued, capitalism without failure has no more bite than religion without sin. To ensure taxpayers share rewards as well as risks, the scheme must give them an equity stake in every bank supported. The package must also get a grip on fat-cat bonuses. A year ago the US administration rejected even the anaemic shareholder discipline on pay found in the UK. But this week, even before last night, Mr Paulson, himself a former bonus beneficiary, had acknowledged that popular anger about top pay must be answered with legislation.</p> <p>Mr Paulson was right to argue that something big needs to happen. Size isn't everything, though. His plan tackles a pressing financial problem. But it falls to Congress to ensure that it does not become a riot of the rich.</p>",
  "<p>The titles of two artistic memoirs offer useful slogans for the central struggles in current politics. For a book in which he looked back on a spell of divorce, dental reconstruction and bereavement, Martin Amis chose the title Experience, wryly invoking the popular theory that it is an advantage to writers to have suffered some events. Meanwhile, the late BBC cultural commissar Sir John Drummond labelled his recollections Tainted by Experience, a phrase allegedly used by a reforming director general to explain why Drummond's vision for the BBC was not to be trusted.</p> <p>These literary references book-end the dilemma of Gordon Brown and John McCain. In rejecting the alternative offered by whippersnapper politicians, each states experience as if it were a virtue in itself. Opponents argue that these experiences have tainted them.</p> <p>All political campaigns must strike a balance between past achievement and future potential. A leader who seems all yesterday is vulnerable to the charge of having stayed too long; but one who projects only tomorrow equally risks the allegation of having run too soon.</p> <p>The UK's two most recent PMs offer contrasting examples. Because our system has recently tended towards long stretches of single-party rule, Tony Blair gained power with no previous cabinet office, as David Cameron, if elected, will also be forced to do. Brown, though, boasted 10 years in the second most significant ministry, a de facto British vice-presidency. The political fates of the two men suggest that external factors - televisual chemistry, economic and political cycles - matter rather more than internal familiarity with sitting at big desks.</p> <p>Even so, the belief that experience matters has still shaped the present White House race, despite the fact that either outcome will result in the first leader without executive experience since the elevation of Senator Kennedy in 1960. In dashing back to Washington, with the promise of using his long-accumulated influence on Capitol Hill to achieve a financial rescue package, the veteran Arizona senator aims to pull political rank over the junior member from Illinois. The manoeuvre, though, is dangerous because playing this card invalidates McCain's already ambitious claim to be an outsider running against Washington business-as-usual.</p> <p>This is a perfect example of the trap that comes from running on experience: the more you promote what you know, people are directed to what you did. This is the same snare that snaps at Brown's ankles. His application to be kept in his job depends almost wholly on his Treasury experience, but it's an impossible proposition that his actions as chancellor resulted only in the good times while having no responsibility for the bad. Emergency economic circumstances have left McCain and Brown both advancing the riskiest of all political pitches: that the guy who dug you into the hole is the guy to dig you out.</p> <p>The problem for voters is that the ideal leader is someone who is fire-tested but not burnt out. Yet the political cycle tends to throw up candidates who have either taken much less or much more heat than that. And so, lacking the perfect option, an electorate may conclude that raw meat is preferable to that which is past its sell-by.</p> <p>To borrow a phrase from another branch of daylight robbery, the difficulty for both Brown and McCain is that they have too much previous. Were they running against a Kenneth Clarke or a John Kerry, such baggage would be neutralised on the scales. But the threat from younger contenders promising new starts has forced them to keep waving their suitcases of stale legislation and yellowed speeches. But as Amis and Drummond discovered, in asserting that a long past merits a future, they are getting ahead of themselves.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>David Walker, in his article discussing the role that thinktanks play in influencing debate, and the question of how \"independent\" such research institutes can be when some appear to have distinct ideologies, mentioned the Charity Commission's interest in these issues (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/sep/17/policy.thinktanks\">Caught in the tank trap</a>, September 17).</p> <p>\"The Charity Commission has struggled to define what is and isn't political, as if that vital ingredient in competitive democracy were a bad thing,\" he suggested, adding: \"The Charity Commission, unfairly, now applies much tighter criteria of non-partisanship to would-be charitable thinktanks than to existing organisations.\" This is not true.</p> <p>Walker has missed a really fundamental point. As the charity regulator, our interest in thinktanks extends only to those which are charities - often established as research charities with educational purposes. As such, they must abide by charity law in return for generous tax breaks and other advantages.</p> <p>This means that they have more to consider in their work than their non-charity peers, because in law charities cannot have political purposes and cannot directly support a party political agenda. There is still plenty of scope for charities to be active in the political arena: they can campaign, lobby, write to and meet MPs to further their charitable work; but they cannot under any circumstances serve a political party.</p> <p>Charities also need to guard their independence when working in a political environment and be aware of any perceptions of bias that may arise that could bring their independence into question. In other words, if a thinktank wants to be a charity, it must behave like a charity.</p> <p>Walker says our commission \"spent months trawling over the activities of the Smith Institute, manually counting the number of 'political references' in transcripts of its seminars, on the grounds that a thinktank named for a former Labour party leader might be biased\". In this particular case we found that the trustees did not adequately manage the risks posed to the institute's independence, and it was vulnerable to the perception that it was involved directly in party politics - never acceptable for a charity. </p> <p>We used our powers to require the trustees to put this right, and they will need to report back to us in six months. We also looked into two other charitable thinktanks, Policy Exchange and Reform, and identified wider lessons from these cases for other charities.</p> <p>We have been very clear about what is or isn't acceptable activity. The rules are the same for all charities, and we are certainly not applying \"tighter criteria\" to charity thinktanks. </p> <p>Of course we accept that thinktanks operate close to the political environment - but the law requires, and the public expects, those which are charities to be independent and never engage in any form of party political activity. It is the responsibility of the trustees of charitable thinktanks to ensure this and to make sure that any involvement their charity has with political parties is balanced.</p> <p>\u2022 Suzi Leather is chair of the Charity Commission <a href=\"mailto:chair@charitycommission.gsi.gov.uk\">chair@charitycommission.gsi.gov.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Way back in the last century, when I was a novice writer working on a collection of coming-of-age stories called Bad Haircut, I developed a lot of what I considered boldly contrarian opinions on the portrayal of teen characters in books and movies. If you'd known me back then, you wouldn't have even had to buy me a beer to learn the following:</p> <p>I couldn't stand The Catcher in the Rye.</p> <p>I hated hated hated The Breakfast Club.</p> <p>The first case was fairly straightforward. Holden Caulfield simply seemed unreal to me. Though he was celebrated as a Teenage Everyman, Salinger's finicky prep school hero didn't bear the slightest resemblance to anyone I'd known growing up in a working-class New Jersey suburb during the sour, pot-addled aftermath of Watergate and the Vietnam war. Literate and suspiciously refined, Holden struck me as little more than wishful thinking on the part of adults, a middle-aged librarian's fondest fantasy of youthful male rebellion. How pleasant it would have been to have a school full of clean-cut aesthetes quoting Robert Burns and wondering where the ducks went when it got cold, rather a legion of glassy-eyed freaks in Pink Floyd T-shirts nodding off in math class and Neanderthal jocks feeling up cheerleaders in the hallway.</p> <p>My problem with The Breakfast Club was a little more complicated. In some ways, John Hughes's landmark 1985 film - Entertainment Weekly magazine recently named it the top high school movie of all time - was right up my alley. Unlike Salinger, Hughes was clearly interested in capturing the texture of adolescence as most kids experienced it. Anyone who'd spent time in suburban America in the second half of the 20th century would have recognised the characters right away. Sure, they were stereotypes - the Brain and the Athlete and the Basket Case and the Princess and the Criminal, as the voiceover helpfully informs us - but at least Hughes's taxonomy was firmly rooted in reality. Not only that, the film was well-paced, often funny, and occasionally revelatory. </p> <p>But it was precisely those virtues that left me unprepared for the sentimental sucker punch of the ending, the teary crescendo of confessions, reconciliations, and budding romances that culminates in the unforgivable makeover inflicted on poor Ally Sheedy. With that one cheap move, I thought, Hughes had betrayed his entire film, taking away everything real that he'd given his audience, replacing it with the fool's gold of a Hollywood ending. I left the theatre fuming, feeling like a friend had stabbed me in the back. (In my defence, let me remind you that I was young and took my movies a lot more seriously than I do now. A few years earlier, I'd come perilously close to dumping an otherwise excellent girlfriend after she professed her admiration for An Officer and a Gentleman.)</p> <p>For more than 20 years now, The Breakfast Club has occupied a place of honour on the list of Movies I Love to Hate, right up there with Jerry Maguire, another overrated film that commits crowd-pleasing moral hara-kiri in the third act. But 20 years is a long time to despise something that most other people claim to enjoy, and the release of a new DVD box set - John Hughes High School Year Book: Sixteen Candles/Weird Science/The Breakfast Club - gave me a good excuse to revisit my old nemesis and find out if one of us had changed.</p> <p>There are a couple of things I can say with certainty after my second viewing of the film. The first is that the editors of Entertainment Weekly must have been high when they compiled their list. There is no way in hell that The Breakfast Club comes close to deserving the title of best high school movie of all time. It shouldn't even be mentioned in the same breath as Richard Linklater's Dazed and Confused, for example, which is funnier and more perceptive, far more authentic and alive, and much more interesting as both social history and cinema. To claim that Hughes's film is somehow superior to Fast Times at Ridgemont High, American Graffiti or Superbad, among others, borders on wilful perversity. The second thing I can say is that I no longer hate The Breakfast Club. </p> <p>It's helpful to watch the film in the context of the new box set, if only because the weaknesses of the other films serve to illuminate the virtues of The Breakfast Club. Weird Science, a high-concept throwaway about a couple of horny nerds who \"create\" their ideal woman by feeding pictures of Albert Einstein and Playboy centrefolds into a powerful computer, is a plodding, unsexy comedy, dangerously close to unwatchable (check out the first 15 minutes if you don't believe me). Sixteen Candles has its moments - Molly Ringwald is adorably pouty as the girl whose birthday passes unnoticed - but the film is maddeningly uneven, a bittersweet romantic comedy weighed down by a heavy-handed soundtrack and leaden attempts at slapstick. The running gag about a giggly Chinese exchange student named Long Duk Dong - aka \"The Donger\" - makes you remember why political correctness was invented in the first place. After all, if a guy with a thick Chinese accent and phallic name isn't funny enough, why not bang a gong every time he appears? Why not have him shout \"Bonzai!\" before tumbling out of a tree at a drunken party? Why not have him say things like, \"No more yankee wankee! The Donger need food!\"</p> <p>As these lesser movies reveal in a hundred different ways, Hughes was not a great believer in restraint, so the solid construction and disciplined storytelling he brought to The Breakfast Club seem are both surprising and refreshing. Entertainment Weekly goes so far as to compare the film to No Exit - \"John Hughes is the genre's Sartre\" - and there's a grain of truth in the hyperbole, if only on the structural level. For better and worse, the movie feels more suited to the stage than the screen, with the bulk of the action taking place in the school library, where the five main characters suffer through nine hours of Saturday detention. With the exception of a momentarily liberating excursion through the empty corridors, a few scenes in the principal's office, and a couple of obligatory dance sequences, the entire film consists of conversations and confrontations between and among the detained students, who assume at first that they have very little in common. What begins as hostile banter slowly turns into a party game that morphs into a group therapy session, resulting in a series of new friendships and two incipient romances.</p> <p>Like Judd Apatow, Hughes worked repeatedly with a small group of actors, and the cast list of The Breakfast Club reads like a Brat Pack honour roll - not only Ringwald (the Princess) and the ubiquitous Hall (the Brain), but Emilio Estevez (the Athlete), Ally Sheedy (the Basket Case), and Judd Nelson (the Criminal). They form a peculiar ensemble, to say the least. Ringwald and Hall, still teenagers at the time of filming, bring a fresh-faced, understated verisimilitude to the party. Estevez (22 years old) and Nelson (a whopping 25) work on an entirely different level of intensity, competing to see who can out-De Niro the other. Sheedy (also 22) is more plausible as a high-school student, and she seems to be having the most fun; there's a nutty gleam in her eyes that cuts through the fog of earnestness emanating from the other actors. The main adult character is Principal \"Dick\" Vernon, a vain bully played by Paul Gleason.</p> <p>Judd Nelson's performance is noteworthy for being completely riveting and utterly unconvincing at the same time. Even though he's billed as as the Criminal - he's in detention for pulling a fire alarm - his character is far more comic than threatening, despite his piercing gaze and outlandish greaser regalia. Even when he pulls out a switchblade after a brief tussle with Estevez, neither the viewer nor the other characters experience the slightest twinge of unease. Nelson dominates the first half of the film, browbeating his detention mates - \"Hey, why don't you close that door and we'll get the prom queen impregnated\" - with a sophisticated vocabulary and theatrical flair that belie his thuggish exterior. \"Screws fall out all the time,\" he tells the principal, who's wondering about a broken door. \"The world's an imperfect place.\" His big dramatic moment, in which he impersonates his brutal father and reveals the abusive home life that lies behind his rebellion, feels more like an improv exercise than a heartbreaking confession.</p> <p>Sheedy strikes a more successful balance as the Basket Case, the artsy neo-goth girl who hides beneath her hair and bulky parka and seems incapable of speech for the first half-hour of the film. Once she does join the group, however, she turns out to be the most perceptive and self-aware of the bunch, not so much participating in the action as providing a mischievous commentary on it. As if mocking the epidemic of self-revelation gripping her comrades, she repeatedly makes shocking proclamations - \"I drink vodka ... Tons!\"; \"I'm a nymphomaniac!\" - only to take them back (\"I'm not a nymphomaniac, I'm a compulsive liar!\"). In the best scene in the film, she goads a worried Estevez into eliciting the dark secret of her family life. \"Is it bad? Real bad?\" he asks in a hushed voice, clearly expecting a confession of sexual abuse. \"Parents? ... What did they did to you?\" She stares at him for a long time before uttering the deadpan reply: \"They ignore me.\" Similarly, after all the others have owned up to the transgressions that have led them to the hell of this Saturday detention, she drops this subversive bombshell: \"I had nothing else to do.\" It's as if Sheedy's character is the only one who's been let in on the real secret: the sadness of being young isn't necessarily the product of abusive or controlling parents, or thick-headed teachers, or too much academic or social pressure, as the rest of the film seems to insist. It just comes with the territory of adolescence, and all you can do is wait it out, making the best of it any way you can. And besides, maybe all you'll find once you're liberated is the sadness of being an adult, and you'll just have to figure out some way to muddle through that, too. </p> <p>Sheedy's character is the most hopeful of the bunch - she's only one who seems to see through and beyond the claustrophobic limits of the immediate situation - which is why her third-act transformation into a normal girl seems so wrong-headed. Hughes wants to treat the makeover as a triumph - just get the hair out of her face and put on a little makeup, and wouldn't you know it, she's cute enough for a jock to kiss! - but in 1985 it struck me not just as a false step but an insult, the negation of everything that was smart and insightful about the film, implying as it did that her withdrawal was the result of a failure to measure up to the standards of high school, rather than a clear-eyed rejection of those standards. For some reason - maybe because I knew it was coming - it didn't bother me so much the second time around. Two decades of increasingly cynical Hollywood endings made this one seem pretty tame by comparison. I also took heart from the discomfort in Sheedy's eyes as she left the school, as if she too realised that she'd made a mistake, that she'd looked a whole lot better with her hair in her face.</p> <p>Sure, The Breakfast Club is schematic, sentimental and a bit too earnest for its good. All you have to do is watch Freaks and Geeks - to my mind, the best treatment of American adolescence ever done in any medium - to see a lot of the same material explored in a more fluid, touching and psychologically persuasive manner. In Freaks and Geeks, the adults aren't simply buffoons and bullies - sometimes they love you and actually understand what you're going through, which creates a whole other set of problems - and the kids are always bigger and more complicated that the stereotypes others use to define them. In other words, Freaks and Geeks starts where The Breakfast Club left off, and gets to places its predecessor couldn't even have dreamed of. But whatever else you might say about John Hughes, you have to give him this - he got there first, and showed everybody else the way. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>John Hughes' High School Year Book is out now on DVD.

  "<p>Kgalema Motlanthe was sworn in as South Africa's president yesterday, putting allies of Jacob Zuma firmly in control of the government after they toppled Thabo Mbeki at the weekend. </p> <p>After a week of the most dramatic political upheaval since the collapse of apartheid, which saw a sitting president swept out of power in a matter of days, Motlanthe sought to reassure South Africans and the financial markets that there would be no dramatic policy changes. </p> <p>The new president pledged to maintain Mbeki's business-oriented economic strategy which has been criticised by many of Zuma's backers, including the unions and Communist party, potentially opening the way for further strife within the ruling African National Congress. </p> <p>\"Mine is not the desire to deviate from what is working. It is not for me to reinvent policy. Nor do I intend to reshape either cabinet or the public service,\" Motlanthe told parliament after his inauguration. \"In a turbulent global economy, we will remain true to the policies that have kept South Africa steady, and that have ensured sustained growth.\"</p> <p>That assurance was reflected in Motlanthe's cabinet which retained many former ministers including Trevor Manuel as finance minister. His resignation after Mbeki was removed sent the Johannesburg stock exchange and rand plummeting as investors feared the loss of the world's longest-serving finance minister, who has overseen continuous economic growth. </p> <p>Manuel said he had merely offered his resignation to allow the president flexibility in choosing his cabinet. But others saw the move as a warning against any significant policy change, despite the pressure from the left, that appears to have been responded to in Motlanthe's speech. </p> <p>Perhaps the most important cabinet change was the removal of Manto Tshabalala-Msimang as health minister. She fronted Mbeki's heavily criticised HIV/Aids policies, blocking the distribution of life-saving drugs in public hospitals and drawing derision at international conferences by suggesting garlic and lemon as a suitable treatment. </p> <p>The leaders of other political parties praised Motlanthe as a man of integrity, humble and hardworking. Pieter Mulder of the mostly Afrikaner Freedom Front-Plus, alluded to the possibility that Motlanthe could supplant Zuma, who is the ANC president, as the party's candidate for president in May's general election. He told parliament a story of two Afrikaner voortrekkers who harness their oxen in the dark only to discover in the morning that they had also harnessed a lion. </p> <p>Their problem, said Mulder turning towards the new president, was that having harnessed the lion they now had to find a way to let it go. The story provoked much laughter and a smile from Zuma who could hardly have missed Mulder's point. </p> <p>Some of the forces that coalesced around Zuma largely regarded him as a vehicle to drive Mbeki out. The unions and the Communist party in particular were seeking to pull Zuma to the left of where the outgoing government was. But their support falls behind Motlanthe more naturally as he is a former leader of the National Union of Mineworkers and trade union confederation stalwart. </p> <p>Motlanthe says he has no presidential ambitions but he would be an attractive presidential candidate for the ANC in May if Zuma's legal problems continue. </p> <p>There are already questions over the degree of Zuma's authority as party president. He publicly opposed removing Mbeki from office so either he was duplicitous or was unable to influence other ANC leaders. But if Motlanthe does not shift economic policy to the left, there is a strong possibility the ANC will split.</p> <p>Amid all the praise for Motlanthe, there was little for Mbeki. Tony Leon, foreign affairs spokesman for the opposition Democratic Alliance, compared his downfall to several Shakespearean tragedies. \"His presidency and the forces behind its collapse seem to combine the ambitions of Lady Macbeth, the jealously of Othello, the backstabbing of Iago and, ultimately in its last act, the impotent rage of King Lear,\" he said. But Robert Mugabe, Zimbabwe's president, described Mbeki's removal from office as \"devastating\".</p>",
  "<p>'Not all of our songs are about death,\" says White Lies' bassist, Charles Cave. Sitting with his bandmates in a west London beer garden, the trio's chief songwriter is disputing a claim he read in the group's Wikipedia entry. \"It's definitely not true. I can only count one ... two. Oh, three. Four ... \" The band's drummer, Jack Brown, changes the subject before Cave can remember any more.</p> <p>In fairness, nobody has yet heard the whole of White Lies' debut album, due in January, so it may yet prove to contain several saucy jigs. But, judging by the six or seven tracks to have surfaced so far, that's unlikely. Death hangs over the band's work like a thick fog.</p> <p>Dressed from head to toe in black, with a store of glowering songs about murder, kidnappings, mental illness and funerals, White Lies are the latest pretenders to Joy Division's gloom-pop throne. And, because the well-spoken Chiswick trio drape their dark, literate tales around skyscraping hooks and galloping, radio-friendly choruses, they are definite contenders for big-league success in 2009.</p> <p>When the band signed to the Universal offshoot Fiction in March following a classic A&amp;R scrum, the label's managing director, Jim Chancellor, declared himself to be \"over the fucking moon\". Nothing the band have done since will have dampened his enthusiasm. They have impressed on Later ... With Jools Holland, played several well-received festival slots, found their way on to Radio 1's daytime playlist and had Mark Ronson, Nick Cave (no relation to Charles) and Morrissey turn up to see them live. Music journalists, meanwhile, have been making glowing comparisons to Echo and the Bunnymen and The Teardrop Explodes (though Cave cites Interpol, Secret Machines and, oddly, Iron Maiden as his influences).</p> <p>If the expectations are increasingly lofty, then the band seem to be taking it all in their stride. When singer Harry McVeigh tells me that \"people have been saying we're potentially an arena band\", there's no arrogance in his voice, but there isn't much doubt either.</p> <p>What makes this all the more remarkable is that just 12 months ago, White Lies didn't exist. In September 2007, the main thing on the then 19-year-olds' minds was whether they should go to university or take a second gap year to pursue their dreams of making it in the music business.</p> <p>The three childhood friends had spent the year after their A-levels flogging the ailing horse that was their previous incarnation, the indie-pop band Fear of Flying. Though Cave describes that band as \"a weekend project\", they got as far as securing management, releasing a couple of singles on the fashionable London indie label Young and Lost Club, and playing support gigs with the Maccabees, Jamie T and Laura Marling.</p> <p>But by this time last year, Fear of Flying seemed unlikely to make it beyond the bottom rung of the pop ladder. \"Fear of Flying was like musical puberty,\" says Cave. \"We were so impressionable when we formed the band [at the age of 15] that we were always worried about what sort of music we should be making. We weren't really being true to ourselves. And I felt as though I couldn't write about anything personal, so I would make up semi-comical stories that weren't really important to anyone, not even me. By the end, we were starting to feel a little embarrassed about certain songs and certain things we'd done.\"</p> <p>Trawl the internet for Fear of Flying leftovers and you'll begin to understand why. There are various photos showing the band in wacky clothes and poses, while the few surviving audio clips sound lightweight and throwaway compared with White Lies' richer, more emotionally charged music.</p> <p>With just two weeks until they were due at their respective universities, the three friends called a band meeting. \"We were clutching at straws at that time,\" admits Cave, \"but we'd just written some new material which we all felt really confident and excited about. It felt like we'd finally found our feet, musically and lyrically. So we agreed to take one last gap year.\"</p> <p>They also decided their new sound was worthy of a new name. \"We wanted a clean slate,\" says Brown. \"We were desperate to make sure that people gave the new songs the kind of respect we felt they deserved, without any preconceptions.\" An announcement was duly posted on Fear of Flying's MySpace site, declaring: \"Fear of Flying is DEAD ... White Lies is alive!\"</p> <p>To some, the trio's miraculous transformation into a much better band, with smarter ideas and stronger songs, seemed a little suspicious. Particularly when it was revealed they had joined the roster of Supervision management - home to Franz Ferdinand and Kaiser Chiefs - within weeks of that MySpace announcement. But they don't miss a beat at the suggestion that they might be the puppets of a pop svengali. \"I don't think we'd accept decisions that other people had made for us,\" says Brown, who also co-founded the hip Chess Club night and record label. \"We're pretty strong-willed and confident in who we are. I think we just grew up.\"</p> <p>As White Lies tell it, they served a useful rock apprenticeship with Fear of Flying, which enabled them to take more control this time around. \"It was extremely helpful,\" says Brown. \"We're much more savvy about the way things work. For instance, we realised that, as a new band, the worst thing you can do is try to force yourself on people. So we were much more restrained in the way we did it. We wanted things to progress naturally.\"</p> <p>In that spirit, the band posted nothing on their MySpace profile but the striking new songs that had prompted their reinvention. \"And that's where it all started to build from,\" says Brown. \"No one knew what we looked like or where we were from, which meant they didn't make any decisions about our image or characters. There was hype around us quite quickly, but that excitement was strictly about the music. It felt like it had solid foundations.\"</p> <p>In fact, the industry buzz around the band began long before they made their live debut, at east London's Hoxton Bar and Grill in February. \"I don't mind admitting that we spent two months rehearsing for that,\" says Brown. \"We wanted to make sure our first show was memorable.\" Not too many paying punters were there to see it, but the roomful of A&amp;Rs went away enthused. Within days, the band had signed their record deal.</p> <p>The show also marked the debut of White Lies' black outfits; they now wear the colour all the time. It was another decision, says McVeigh, that was made to keep the attention on the music, \"because we didn't want people to judge us on what we were wearing.\" \"Plus,\" adds Cave, \"there's no denying that wearing black suits the style of our music.\"</p> <p>Ah yes, the gloom. Even if the band's sudden leap in quality can be put down to maturing, that doesn't explain why Cave went from writing witty ditties about buses and pets to the bleak, moody songs he now provides for McVeigh to sing. Did something unfortunate happen to expose his tortured soul? \"Not really,\" says Cave. \"My songs are definitely more personal than they were before, but I'm not sure tortured soul is the right term.\"</p> <p>Instead, Cave says that White Lies lyrics simply chart one side of his personality - the pessimistic, overthinking side. As a child he often worried about dying, and still fosters a fascination (\"as opposed to involvement\") with religion. </p> <p>But, in person, that's all hidden away, and the effusive songwriter is noticeably lacking in dark intensity. Instead, the whole band come across as enthusiastic, well-balanced individuals, always polite and careful not to say anything too contentious. It's no great surprise to learn that they all still live with their parents.</p> <p>Of course, if all goes to plan, White Lies should soon be soundtracking the bedroom strops of teenagers everywhere, and the three 20-year-olds' worlds will be turned upside down. \"We're definitely in the calm before the storm right now,\" agrees McVeigh. This week, the band released their first single on Fiction - called, naturally, Death - and have embarked on a string of dates that will take them across the UK and America. \"This is when we'll see if people actually want to check us out,\" says Brown. \"We're under no illusions that success is assured.\"</p> <p>It is, though, desired. McVeigh may talk airily of White Lies' ambition being simply to \"connect with people, whether it be a huge number or a relatively small number\", but they admit they would be extremely disappointed if they have just a few dozen enthusiastic followers this time next year.</p> <p>\"Our sound suits big venues,\" says Cave. \"We do want to be successful,\" agrees Brown. \"I don't think we'd ever put a ceiling on what we wanted to achieve as a band.\"</p> <p>For the first time today, the fervour that fuels Cave's songwriting flashes to the surface. \"Yeah,\" he exclaims, \"we should headline Judgment Day!\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Death is out now on Fiction. White Lies play the Leadmill, Sheffield, tonight, then tour</p>",
  "<p>World leaders yesterday announced an ambitious plan to end all malaria deaths by 2015, backed by unprecedented funding of nearly $3bn (\u00a31.6bn) from donors, including the World Bank and the Gates Foundation.</p> <p>A key part of the strategy is the introduction of a vaccine against the deadly disease, which is now just entering the final stage of trials. Although the vaccine is expected to be only partially effective, it will still save thousands of lives.</p> <p>A donation of $168.7m from Bill Gates today ensures that scientists will go on to develop further vaccines in the hope, eventually, of being able to give total immunity to all babies in affected countries soon after birth.</p> <p>Yesterday's announcements at a UN special summit on the millennium development goals in New York, attended by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, together with the presidents of Rwanda and Tanzania, Gordon Brown and other leaders, sets the bar in the fight against malaria higher than ever before.</p> <p>With tools that are now proven to work, such as long-lasting, insecticide-impregnated bed nets, indoor spraying against malarial mosquitoes, and new drugs as well as the expected vaccine, it is now hoped not only to bring malaria under control by 2010 but to eliminate deaths from the disease.</p> <p>Brown called the strategy launch \"a real and vital turning point\" which \"brings together a new coalition of forces - government, the private sector and NGOs - to ensure we all rise to the challenge of eradicating malaria deaths by 2015\". One million people die every year of malaria, most of them in Africa. </p> <p>The largest slice of the new money comes from the Global Fund, a body which finances the fight against Aids, tuberculosis and malaria, which has approved $1.62bn in country grants over two years and then the World Bank, which is putting $1.1bn into Africa over three years. </p> <p>The Bank is focusing on the Democratic Republic of Congo and Nigeria, where 30%-40% of all malaria deaths occur. Group president Robert Zoellick said endemic malaria also had serious financial consequences for families. </p> <p>\"Malaria preys on the poor and keeps them poor. Poverty prevents people from buying bed nets to prevent malaria and medicine to cure it,\" he said. \"When people are struck by the disease, parents miss work, children miss school and malaria emergencies plunge families into debt from which they can't recover.\"</p> <p>Bed nets, sprays and artemisinin drugs, derived from the Chinese wormwood plant, have all helped bring malaria rates down in some smaller countries, but a vaccine could have the biggest impact. </p> <p>The one about to enter final trials, which is being tested on 16,000 babies aged five to 17 months in a number of countries, seven of them in Africa, is the result of a public/private partnership by GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals with the backing of the Path Malaria Vaccine Initiative (MVI). It has been shown to reduce malaria cases by 30% and halve the numbers of children getting severe malaria.</p> <p>Christian Loucq, director of MVI, said the new vaccine, currently known only as RTS,S, could be available by 2013, if it is swiftly approved by the European licensing authority and then the World Health Organisation, as seems likely. But the money from the Gates Foundation is a recognition of MVI's plans to engage researchers on the development of an even better vaccine.</p> <p>\"I'm very hopeful that the malaria vaccine currently in advanced testing will be proven effective, but that will just be the first step,\" said Bill Gates. \"Now it's time to develop a new generation of vaccines that could someday eradicate malaria altogether.\"</p>",
  "<p>Residents of the planned eco towns in England could face strict monitoring of their travel habits, home insulation and even wasted food, to ensure they are truly living a \"green\" lifestyle.</p> <p>Experts advising the government on its plans to build up to 10 eco towns by 2020, yesterday called for ministers to toughen environmental standards for the developments with monitoring to ensure their carbon footprint is three times smaller than the British average.</p> <p>The recommendation is that there should be detailed scrutiny of the number of trips residents make by car, and the types of waste produced by households and businesses. Thermographic cameras should be used to check which homes lose heat, according to the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (Cabe).</p> <p>The monitoring plans are part of the proposed standards for the government's flagship housing programme, which has been criticised for failing to demand the highest levels of sustainability.</p> <p>Cabe and Bioregional, the company that initiated the low-energy BedZed housing estate in south London, want the government to ensure that the carbon footprint of eco towns is no larger than allowed under principles of \"one-planet living\". </p> <p>At present, the average Briton is responsible for almost 12 tonnes of CO2 each year and if everyone in the world consumed as much, three planets would be required to support the human population. The average Chinese person is thought to live a \"one-planet\" lifestyle.</p> <p>\"If eco towns are to have a fundamental purpose, it must be to show us how we can all achieve one-planet living,\" said Richard Simmons, chief executive of Cabe. \"Eco towns should show us, in a real and measured way, what our sustainable future will look like.\"</p> <p>Cabe's proposed rules are stricter than the latest government guidance on eco towns and come in advance of the publication next month of draft planning policy setting out the levels of sustainability and environmental soundness of the new developments.</p> <p>Techniques for monitoring residents could include checking the ecological footprint of the diet of 100 randomly selected residents, and calculating CO2 emissions from transport movements.</p> <p>Opponents of eco towns, who have argued that the developments would be little more than standard housing estates, said the proposals would create a \"Big Brother\" environment.</p> <p>\"We are supposed to be free to live how we want and we don't need the authorities counting the miles we drive or taking thermal images of the draughts in our house,\" said David Bliss, chairman of Bard, the campaign against the Middle Quinton eco town in Warwickshire. \"We have talked about these places becoming like gulags and now we have the monitoring to match.\"</p> <p>Cabe is also calling for all homes to be powered by renewable energy with gas supply only available as a backup. It said there should be at least 50 dwellings per hectare (2.5 acres) rising to 100 in the centre, and retailers should provide plenty of products with a low meat and dairy content, in line with studies that showed a significant reduction in animal product meals could cut the ecological footprint of food by 60%. \"Consumer goods account for 14% of an individual's ecological footprint and the target should be to halve the impact from this,\" the report said.</p>",
  "<p>Professor Brian Bercusson, who has died aged 60, was one of the brightest stars of the Cambridge school of labour lawyers nurtured by Bob Hepple and Paul O'Higgins in the 1960s and 70s. He played a prominent part in the development of European labour law, on which he became a pre-eminent authority; and was a key adviser to the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC), where he was held in the highest regard.</p> <p>Brian studied law at the LSE before moving to Cambridge, where he wrote an outstanding PhD thesis on what is now called public procurement. By the time this was published - as Fair Wages Resolutions - in 1978, he had already earned a formidable reputation, having written superbly about the Labour government's employment protection legislation. A spell as research fellow at Christ's College, Cambridge, was followed by academic appointments at Brunel University, and Queen Mary College, London University, before a move to the European University Institute in Florence as a professor in 1986.</p> <p>While cementing his reputation as an original and independent thinker, in these early years Brian combined scholarship with a range of other activities, and was notably active in the cause of trade union education (about which he remained passionate all his life). He developed shop steward and branch officer courses for the public service workers' union Nalgo, as it then was, and presented classes at Ruskin College, Oxford, before subsequently extending his reach to trade unionists throughout Europe. He was a highly popular teacher, effective in making the law accessible to non-lawyers.</p> <p>Brian's time in Florence coincided with an emerging optimism within the Labour movement about the European social model, famously presented to the TUC by Jacques Delors in 1988. In establishing himself as a leading figure in the discipline, Brian produced European Labour Law in 1996. This seminal text is the most comprehensive treatment of the subject he helped to create. Although many have written on European labour law before and since, it is no disrespect to any of them to say that none has done so with the same depth, flair or imagination revealed in that volume, a much-anticipated second edition of which Brian completed before his death.</p> <p>In 1994, Brian returned to a chair in European law at Manchester, before becoming professor of European social and labour law at King's College London in 2000. He was retained as a consultant by Thompsons, the trade union solicitors, and as an expert by the European parliament's employment and social affairs committee. With the ETUC, he played a key role in developing the intellectual foundations for a social Europe, while advising on a wide range of issues from the EU charter of rights, to the British opt-out from the Lisbon treaty in 2007, on which he heaped scorn in great measure. His work on the charter was published in eight languages.</p> <p>Brian was greatly optimistic about the potential of the European social model, and recent decisions of the European court of justice in its now infamous Viking and Laval judgments were a great disappointment. Delivered within the last 12 months, these decisions impose serious restrictions on trade union rights. But disappointed though he may have been, Brian never lost his optimism or combative spirit, leading the way with the ETUC, the TUC, and with bodies including the Institute of Employment Rights (of which he was an active and distinguished member) to develop strategies on how to minimise the impact of the decisions.</p> <p>In recent years, Brian had worked closely with the networks of European labour lawyers that he helped to create and maintain. He formed strong intellectual bonds with leading continental scholars including Alain Supiot and Ulrich M\u00fcckenberger, and enjoyed working with Niklas Bruun at the Swedish Institute for Working Life, before it was closed down by the government last year. He also collaborated with leading scholars in the United States, most notably Bill Gould, of Stanford University, who had been Bill Clinton's appointee as chairman of the US national labor relations board.</p> <p>Brian was born in Montreal, the second of seven children. He was educated in Canada and Israel, and entered the LSE as an undergraduate on the advice of his father, who had been inspired by Harold Laski. Brian's love of European culture was well known, and many speak warmly of visits to the family home at Rignana, south of Florence. His extraordinary talent, infectious enthusiasm and positive outlook won him countless friends and admirers.

  "<p>It is always difficult meeting an actor from a TV show; yes, yes, he might look like the character he plays, but you have to remind yourself that this doesn't mean he is like the character. Interviewing Rainn Wilson, who plays the very nerdy but ever so slightly scary office suck-up Dwight K Schrute on the US version of The Office, presents a somewhat unexpected problem. Weirdly, he doesn't physically resemble the character at all - he is much softer, perhaps a little podgier, than he appears on TV, and Dwight's eternal scowl is swapped for a permanent expression of ironic bemusement. </p> <p>But talking to him is a decidedly Dwight-ish experience, which is to say it's a little bit unnerving, often hilarious and very, very weird. In the two hours we spend together, conversation moves blithely from sci-fi to imperialism to how religion controls his life. He talks in Dwight's slow, drawling monotone, with unexpected bursts into emphases and a very dry humour. When he finds something funny, instead of laughing he simply says \"That's hilarious,\" with the facial expression most would adopt when announcing an impending apocalypse.</p> <p>He finds my name fascinating and utters it as often and as emphatically as possible (\"Have some tea, HADLEY\", \"That's an interesting question, HADLEY\") and while I'm quite used to people finding my name hilarious, it does seem a bit rich coming from someone called Rainn, whose wife is called Holiday Reinhorn.</p> <p>Despite his obvious intelligence, he has that very American (and I say that as an American), and somewhat Dwightish, gauche belief that there is nothing foreigners find funnier than being mocked to their faces. Each time the slightly starstruck waitress comes by to check if we're enjoying our \"Wimbledon tea\" (chocolate dipped strawberries, tarts, tea and cream), he replies in a British accent that would make Dick van Dyke weep.</p> <p>We meet in an anonymous London hotel, where he is promoting The Rocker - basically an even sillier version of School of Rock. Wilson stars as Fish, a frustrated thirtysomething whose ejection from a metal band as a teenager has caused a lifetime of resentment, exacerbated by the band's subsequent worldwide domination. Through plot machinations that need not be examined too closely, he joins his teenage nephew's band and gets a second chance at musical fame.</p> <p>But if the plot is vaguely familiar, then the other faces are, too: alongside Wilson are Christina Applegate, Emma Stone and Jane Lynch, all of whom have appeared in movies directed or produced by Judd Apatow, the current king of Hollywood comedy. So is Wilson part of Apatow's clique? \"I don't really know if I'm part of any group, to be honest,\" he says, in one of his few genuine moments in the interview. \"But hopefully we'll all be working together one day.\"</p> <p>Although Wilson is not yet a movie star, he is very much at the heart of The Office: An American Workplace, in the role taken in Britain by Mackenzie Crook. After some initial shakiness (\"The pilot was pretty dreadful\"), the show has achieved a success comparable to Ricky Gervais's original in the US. Although there are structural similarities between the two shows - there is a smarmy boss, a pretty receptionist, a lovelorn worker and his nemesis the office suck-up - it is actually very different from, and much better than, the UK version. For a start, it's much more generous: all of the characters have interesting storylines and inner lives. Dwight even gets to have a little office romance with the uptight and very Christian Angela - \"Oh yeah, that was a good time\" - which Gareth certainly didn't. But it is also a far bigger proposition than the British version: whereas the latter made only a dozen episodes, the Americans have made more than five times that many and the show is still going. </p> <p>Yet it's clear that Wilson, after only a few days in London, is tired of defending his version to the Ricky Gervais fans.</p> <p>\"Being in London's been really interesting. I was looking around the other day and I thought, how did these odd, snaggle-toothed, pasty, eccentric, red-faced, pot-bellied weirdos control the world? I mean, you guys once dominated everywhere! But then you talk to British fans of the British show, there is this persistence and pride in it, like real British bulldogs, and I was like, 'Oh, I get it!' If you took that pride over the English Office and applied it to imperialism again, you would conquer the whole world, from corner to corner.\"</p> <p>Wilson was born \"possibly on a houseboat\" and raised in Seattle, Washington. \"No brothers, no sisters. What a lonely life I led,\" he says mournfully. However, he had plenty of entertainment from his parents: his father worked as an abstract painter, a science fiction writer (mainly unpublished) and a sewage worker. His mother was a performance artist and had a penchant for painting her body blue and running around naked on stage. Would he describe them as weird? \"Yes,\" he replies instantly. \"They're still pretty weird, though they probably think they're really normal now because they've learned how to pay rent occasionally.\" His father has just finished his latest science fiction book, The Zombies of Gog (\"I told him he needs to change that title as soon as possible\") which Wilson describes as \"pretty nifty\". </p> <p>His parents were, he adds superfluously, \"weird bohemian types\". So is his name a reflection of their hippy leanings? \"Yeah. Although I guess Rain with just one N was too hippyish even for them. I tell everyone the extra N is for extra nookie.\" It must have been a terrible name to have at school. \"Oh yeah. Teased, bullied, beat up, everything. And from that crucible of pain,\" he concludes with a dramatic lowering of his eyes, \"I emerged, the sad clown that you see today.\" </p> <p>In fact, his name wasn't an expression of his parents' love for nature, but rather in honour of Rainer Maria Rilke, making him probably the only person on American TV named after a modern German poet. And really, it was a lucky escape: his mother wanted to name him Thucydides.</p> <p>His family was, he mentions several times, very poor, but every week when he was a child his father would take him to the university bookstore and say, \"Go, buy as many books as you like.\" Wilson would come back with about 20 books, which his father would buy without a blink. Mainly he was into sci-fi then, influenced by his father, and to this day he has a huge collection of sci-fi paperbacks - \"many of which are collectibles,\" he says, with Dwightish pride. These days, though, his reading tastes have moved on a little: \"Yeah, not too much sci-fi. Mainly just fi.\"</p> <p>When Wilson was a teenager, he and his family moved to Chicago where his parents ran a Bah\u00e1'\u00ed centre. The Bah\u00e1'\u00ed faith - in essence, a belief in the unity of all religions - holds a huge amount of importance in Wilson's life, and for only the second time in our two hours together he talks without any irony. \"It's a long story, but I abandoned it all when I was younger. And then about eight years ago I went on a spiritual journey that led me ultimately back to the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed faith as it was the only one that made sense to me,\" he says. Does it affect his work choices? \"Absolutely! Often I get sent things that I find morally reprehensible, and this is coming from a guy promoting a movie in which he shows his ass crack throughout. But there's some stuff that is just wrong, such as violence or humour that is grotesque or mean-spirited or really sexist. It doesn't make the world a better place.\" </p> <p>He first started acting at school in Chicago. He was cast as the lead in his school play and then that epiphanical event happened that has put so many actors on to the path to stardom: \"Girls started liking me. Before then, I'd never had any interest from the ladies. So really, my course was clear.\"</p> <p>Clear, if not exactly in the fast lane. For the next 20 years, Wilson struggled from bit part to bit part. He ran a removals company in New York (\"I was the guy who could fit the futon down any staircase\") before finally getting cast as an undertaker in Six Feet Under and then The Office when he was 39. </p> <p>He is clearly enjoying late success. He's already made several other movies and is writing a film about a ninja, which he and Jason Reitman (Juno) plan to start filming next summer. But the biggest accolade was being voted one of People magazine's 50 Sexiest People. How did that feel? \"Pretty sexy. I knew I'd arrived,\" he says, with no small amount of satisfaction. And how did his wife feel? \"She was so excited she told me to clean out the garage.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>The Rocker is released on October 17</p>",
  "<p>We've all been children, we all know a parent or parent-figure. This makes us all potential writers of children's books. I think of children's books as not so much for children, but as the filling that goes between the child world and the adult world. One way or another, all children's books have to negotiate that space, whether it's thinking about how the text of a picture book will sound when read aloud, or how the child views him or herself in a world run by adults. And before it reaches the hand, eye or ear of a child there are many adults to deal with: editors, illustrators, publicists, marketing people, the buying adults. And of course, more than likely, you're an adult reading this, so the moment you think about writing something for children, you'll be handling something or other from your own childhood. This may be something you read, experiences of being read to, pleasurable or painful experiences from when you were young. </p> <p>There is also an interesting line between the child you once were and the children you know now. If you want to write a book for children, you will find yourself travelling to and fro along this line, wondering one moment about what kind of child you were, why you had those particular tastes and interests, what depressed or excited you, what you were afraid of, what you yearned for; the next, looking, listening and thinking about the children you know or meet. Are there big differences, or is there some core child-ness that is unchanged? Is the culture and background you came from, similar or different to the kinds of children you know and meet now? If so, how does your writing reach them? </p> <p>So you know you want to write something. As you'll read in the rest of this booklet, children's literature has very specific forms or genres. It may sometimes seem to you that editors can only think inside specific boxes, whereas a book you liked, The Little Prince, say, defied such boxes. So you'll hear from editors, comments like: \"There's no point in writing a picture book text that's longer than a couple of hundred words\", \"That story is too 'old' for a picture book audience\", \"Your story is too short\" and so on. Bafflingly, if you go to the library and pick up a pile of books, you may well find some that seem to defy such boundaries. Nearly always, that's because it's a famous author who's been granted leeway to write what they want - Roald Dahl's The Minpins is an example of that. Or you've got in your hand a book produced by an independent company, a firm like Tamarind, Frances Lincoln or Barefoot Books. </p> <p>What this means is that any of us who write for children have to do homework. We have to be very aware of both what is being published and how people are telling stories these days. The writer Morris Gleitzman told me that he sets himself one golden rule when he writes for children: \"Start any scene as 'late' into the action or dialogue as you can.\" In other words, don't hang about. That's his perception of today's audience. </p> <p>If you're serious about writing, you'll need some kind of axiom (or several) like that so that you put yourself in control of what you're putting down on the page. </p> <p>We also have to spend time in bookshops, libraries, nurseries, schools and with reading children, seeing how the books work with the audiences. You are of course the first audience for what you write, but you want to make yourself the kind of reader who can pretend to be the reading child. You've got to build in a sense of your audience as part of the way in which you're tough with yourself about what you're writing. Part of that reading child will inevitably be the reading child you once were. That's no bad thing, but quite often, I would suggest, this is not sufficient. You also need to get that child who is now the age of your target audience into your head too. </p> <p>The world of children's books is a very friendly, decent place to be. It's full of people who are desperate to enlighten, interest and excite children in ideas, imaginary worlds and contemporary issues. Everywhere you look in this world, you'll find very committed, low-paid people, who will go the extra mile if it means reaching a child who might not otherwise come across a book. There are a whole host of organisations trying to foster a love of reading and the moment you've got something written and published, no matter how modest, there are all sorts of places that will be interested in inviting you to share what your book with some children. A very important part of writing for children is appearing at book festivals, and in libraries and schools. An important part of becoming a writer for children is seeing what published writers do and say when they appear. Writing children's books may be as lonely as any other kind of writing, but there is a big social element in how the books are taken to the readers. There are thousands of people out there doing this - parents, librarians and teachers mostly - so part of being a writer for children is being among these people at the events they organise. If you get the balance right, this will be part of what motivates you to go back into the cell and write some more! </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Michael Rosen is the Children's Laureate.

  "<p>Opening pages are so important. You can capture a reader's interest, or immediately lose it. (And before you have any chance of reaching readers, your work must catch an editor's interest.) Where does your story begin? Why there? Is there a decisive moment - a phone call, a meeting, a discovery - that sparks off the whole thing? </p> <p>It is advisable to get into the story quickly, rather than loading your opening pages with explanations and information. The unpacking of relevant background can be done bit by bit as the story moves on; and you may not need as much of this as you think.</p> <p>Let's look at some openings to novels for children and teenagers. See if you agree with me that these first paragraphs are written with a confidence and authority that make you want more:</p> <p>\"Her delicate skeleton was lifted from the stand on which it had hung for longer than anyone could remember. The leg and arm bones made hollow, musical sounds as they knocked against each other gently. Like bamboo wind chimes in a breeze. For a moment she seemed to be dancing. Her legs moving, her arms lifting and her body swaying to some strange music only she could hear.</p> <p>She was dancing again after being still for so long.</p> <p>At least, that's how I imagined it had happened, even though the photograph showed nothing of this.\"<br><strong>Fish Notes and Star Songs, by Dianne Hofmeyr</strong></p> <p>\"I have been in love with Titus Oates for quite a while now - which is ridiculous, since he's been dead for ninety years. But look at it this way. In ninety years I'll be dead, too, and then the age difference won't matter.</p> <p>Besides, he isn't dead inside my head. We talk about all kinds of things.\"<br><strong>The White Darkness by Geraldine McCaughrean</strong></p> <p>\"When the Dead Man got Rachel I was sitting in the back of a wrecked Mercedes wondering if the rain was going to stop. I didn't want it to stop. I was just wondering.</p> <p>It was late, almost midnight.\"<br><strong>The Road of the Dead by Kevin Brooks</strong></p> <p>\"Remember? I can still smell it. I met her in the Aldwych Underground Station, at half past six in the morning, when people were still busily rolling up their bedding, and climbing out to see how much of the street was left standing. There were no lavatories down there, and with houses going down like ninepins every night there was a shortage of baths in London just then, and the stench of the Underground was appalling. I noticed, as I lurked around, trying to keep inconspicuous, that there was someone else doing the same. I was lurking because I wanted to stay in the warm for as long as possible, without being one of the very last out, in case any busybody asked me tricky questions. And there was this girl, as clearly as anything, lurking too.\"<br><strong>Fireweed by Jill Paton Walsh</strong></p> <p>What marks out good writing is hard to define. To me, it says: \"I know what I'm doing. Come with me. I won't let you down.\" It's not trying to show off, but it has an energy that is unmistakable, and a sense of living in the moment. </p> <h2>Exercise: first page</h2> <p>Pick some books at random from the children's or teenagers' shelves in the library. Read just the first page of each. Which ones catch your attention and make you want more? How? Which ones don't work so well, and why?</p> <p>Now look at your own first page in the same way.</p>",
  "<p>This is an essential part of writing, and should be enjoyable. You'll only improve your writing if you're self-critical; if you develop a sense of the best writing, and tune your ear. This is the time to make significant changes to your work. You're not facing the pressure of finishing the end of the story; it's all there, and everything you do now will be an improvement.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Is the story as good as it can be? </p> <p>Don't be in too much hurry to send your work to a publisher or agent. The euphoria of reaching the end can be misleading; you're too close to the work to judge its quality. Leave it for a while - a week, a month, longer if possible. Then read it, trying to forget that you're the author. This will help you to notice problems of pacing, scene-setting, etc and also you'll appreciate which parts of the story work well.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Are my opening pages engaging? </p> <p>Are you expecting your reader to plod through stodgy explanations before the story really begins? If you're opening pages are cluttered with information, consider ditching that chapter altogether. Bits of background can be dropped in later.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Would the writing be stronger with fewer words? </p> <p>Cutting is an important part of revising. Don't patronise your reader by spelling everything out. Use adverbs sparingly; they're often not needed, particularly when applied to speech. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Read your work aloud. </p> <p>And don't rush it - spread the reading over several days, if necessary. This way, you'll notice clumsy repetitions, nonsensical sentences, accidental rhyming or a phrase that's difficult to get your tongue round, and you'll get a sense of whether or not your dialogue sounds convincing. It helps develop your ear for rhythm, too because rhythm is just as important in prose as it is in poetry. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Do key events carry enough weight? </p> <p>Inexperienced writers sometimes rush through the most dramatic events, which has the effect of making them seem ordinary. Allow for pauses in conversations and, in action sequences, the moments when time seems to go into slow-motion. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Is the tension sustained? </p> <p>There will be rises and dips, but don't let the tension fall away altogether, or there's no reason for the reader to continue. Plotting this as a graph, chapter by chapter, will show you the shape of your story.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> I'd like an opinion of my work. Who shall I give it to? </p> <p>It can be tempting to show your work to your friends, or to various members of your family, but don't try to please everyone. If you have a trusted friend whose opinion you value, it's more productive than getting vague or half-hearted responses from people who don't know what to say.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Make it happen</p> <p>Finally: many people have a dream of writing a novel. It's not going to write itself; you'll have to make it happen. </p> <h2>What makes good writing stand out?</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> \"The kind of writing that catches my attention is clear, uncluttered prose, with pace and momentum.\" <br><strong>Jon Appleton, editor, Orion Children's Books</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> \"A young, contemporary outlook.

  "<p>With his head high, British designer Matthew Williamson took his final bow as artistic director of the Florentine print label Pucci as Milan fashion week drew to a close yesterday.</p> <p>Williamson has held the position for the past three years in addition to designing his own London-based eponymous line, but from October 1, when his contract comes to an end, Peter Dundas - a relatively unknown Norwegian designer - will step into his shoes. </p> <p>At first the Pucci/Williamson coupling seemed liked the ideal marriage, he being a lover of prints and bright colour, both hallmarks of the 60-year-old label. Williamson quickly established a formula of resort dressing for the exceedingly rich. From Gstaad to Capri, Williamson had the wealthy holiday wardrobe sorted. </p> <p>But recently there have been criticisms that the label was starting to look more like the designer's signature line. Indeed, yesterday, although there were brightly printed swimsuits to please the Pucci faithful, a bold tiger and jungle design on a mesh jumpsuit was a look only one of Williamson's famous Ibizan party-circuit friends could pull off.</p> <p>There have been rumours that the Pucci bosses were unhappy with Williamson's multitasking and travelling, particularly as he is in the process of expanding his business in the US. In a recent interview, Laudomia Pucci, daughter of the company's founder, Emilio, stated how important it is that Dundas will be based in Florence. He has a strong print background and although he is currently collaborating with a Parisian furrier, he will no doubt have fewer distractions than Williamson.</p> <p>Later in the day, Dolce &amp; Gabbana returned to their origins: albeit the label's Sicilian roots rather than its \"molto sexy\" ones. The designers produced a collection that could only be described as three parts rich baroque, two parts men's silk pyjamas. It might sound ridiculous but it was beautiful. There was a focus on geometric shapes - circles, rectangles and pentagons formed the shoulders of many of the elegantly cut duchesse satin dresses. Best of all was a jumpsuit made from silk pyjama fabric that was tie-belted at the waist. A departure for this label, and a welcome one.</p>",
  "<p>Constitutional experts and minority parties yesterday rallied behind proposals to repeal the 300-year bar to Catholics succeeding to the throne and end male precedence in the royal succession.</p> <p>Following the Guardian's report yesterday that plans drawn up by the Labour backbencher Chris Bryant have gone to Downing Street, reformers agreed that the 1701 Act of Settlement barring Papists from the throne, passed after the Glorious Revolution, is outdated.</p> <p>Lynne Featherstone, the Lib Dems' spokeswoman on equalities issues, said: \"This is an overdue but welcome move. Whilst the hereditary principle itself is obviously still a bit dodgy, at least this modernisation ends the outrageous discrimination against Catholics and women.\"</p> <p>Alex Salmond, the Scottish first minister, said: \"I welcome these moves. The Act of Settlement is an 18th-century anachronism that has no place in a modern 21st-century constitution. The SNP first raised the issue over a decade ago, the Scottish parliament united in 1999 to call for this long overdue reform, and I hope the prime minister follows through in early course.\"</p> <p>Jeffrey Jowell QC, a constitutional expert, added: \"The law is incompatible with the present culture of equality, [which] is in itself a much stronger constitutional principle, though unwritten. That justifies the removal of those aspects of the Act of Settlement which offend the principle of equality.\"</p> <p>A Downing Street spokesman stressed the range of constitutional changes that could be required to change the law. \"To bring about changes to the law on succession would be a complex undertaking involving amendment or repeal of a number of items of required legislation, as well as requiring the consent of legislatures of member nations of the Commonwealth ... we are of course aware of the concerns felt by many and we are always ready to consider the arguments in this complex area.\"</p> <p>Nick Herbert, the shadow constitutional affairs spokesman, questioned why the issue was being raised now.</p> <p>\"If [Gordon Brown] really believes change is justified, the government should publish a consultative document so that the issues can be debated properly and the Anglican church and others consulted.\"</p> <p>The Church of England was itself dismissive of the move, fearing the consequences for its constitutional status as the established church. A spokesman told the Guardian: \"We cannot comment on everything. These are one person's thoughts. The church carries on and waits for something real to happen.\"</p> <p>Church sources stressed that any government proposals from the Bryant report would depend on Labour winning a fourth term and would relate to a constitutional situation which might not arise for many decades: a close heir to the throne eventually wishing to marry a Catholic without relinquishing their right of succession, or having a female first child prepared to demand a right of primogeniture, which in current circumstances could be half a century or more away.</p> <p>Senior church figures insist that having a head of state who is not a member of the Church of England would inevitably lead to disestablishment and the unravelling of a complicated ball of sometimes ancient legislation, with attendant arcane property disputes - a process which would take up considerable parliamentary time for a Labour government which took seven years to abolish fox hunting.</p> <p>Professor Robert Hazell, of the constitution unit at University College London, said: \"It is quite seriously complex. There are at least seven separate pieces of legislation that would require to be amended or repealed and 15 other countries with the sovereign as head of state, each with different political circumstances and priorities that would need to be consulted. It is not something Britain can do unilaterally and I suspect Labour MPs and their constituents might not think it a priority in current circumstances.\"</p> <h2>View from Scotland</h2> <p>Downing Street's proposals were welcomed by Scotland's most senior Catholic, Cardinal Keith O'Brien, the church's most prominent critic of the 300-year-old law. In the past he has branded the bar as \"state-sponsored sectarianism\". A spokesman for the cardinal said: \"This is an anachronistic law; if it were to abolish this legislation the government would be upholding the principle of fairness, not just towards Catholics but all UK residents. Sadly, however, talk of repeal has hit the headlines many times in recent years - it has yet to be followed with action.\" </p> <p>Pressure for reform has been at its most intense in Scotland, largely because of greater social tensions between Catholics and Protestants and pressure from nationalists for wider constitutional reform. The proposals would dilute a source of grievance for nationalists. </p> <p>The Catholic church in England has failed to support O'Brien's complaints in the past, insisting that issues such as abortion, gay marriages and social justice were far more pressing and relevant. Senior Labour politicians, including prominent Catholics such as Des Browne, the defence secretary and Scottish secretary, shared those reservations. Browne told the Guardian this year that removing the historic bar would be legally extremely complex.<br><strong>Severin Carrell</strong></p>",
  "<p>A British artist walked free yesterday after being cleared of insulting Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Turkish prime minister, by portraying him as a dog in a case seen as a test of Turkey's tolerance of free speech.</p> <p>A Turkish court acquitted Michael Dickinson of criminal charges despite citing \"some insulting elements\" in his depiction of Erdogan as a dog attached to a leash in the colours of the US flag. But the court ruled that the artwork was \"within the limits of criticism\".</p> <p>Dickinson, 58, who has lived in Turkey for 20 years, was charged with \"insulting the prime minister's dignity\" in September and could have faced up to two years in jail if convicted. He was arrested after unfurling the picture at a court hearing of an art exhibition organiser, who had been charged with insulting behaviour for displaying another of Dickinson's works. The earlier picture depicted Erdogan as a dog being presented with a rosette by George Bush. His acquittal may ease some pressure on Turkey from the EU, which called on Ankara to improve its record on human rights and freedom of speech issues as a condition of entry.</p> <p>Dickinson, a member of the Stuckist art movement, voiced relief at his acquittal but warned that other artists still faced legal pressure for expressing dissenting views. \"I am lucky to be acquitted. There are still artists in Turkey facing prosecution and being sentenced for their opinions,\" he told AP.</p> <p>The verdict ended a saga which has included four court hearings and seen Dickinson's fellow Stuckists calling first on Tony Blair and then Gordon Brown to intervene.</p> <p>Charges were pressed against Dickinson after he displayed his poster of Erdogan on a leash, which he called Good Boy, at the trial of Erkan Kara, organiser of an exhibition staged by the Global Peace and Justice Coalition, a campaign opposed to the US-led occupation of Iraq. Kara had been prosecuted after the exhibition showed Dickinson's earlier poster.</p> <p>Dickinson was forced to leave Turkey after his residence permit was cancelled but was charged when he returned on a tourist visa. After his arrest he spent 10 days in police detention during which an attempted escape was foiled when a pursuing police officer fired a gun at him.</p> <p>Dickinson, who was born in Durham, is not the first artist to have been prosecuted for allegedly insulting Erdogan. In 2005 the prime minister successfully sued a cartoonist who portrayed him as a cat tangled up in a ball of wool. Dickinson had earlier gained notoriety when his website was blanked by the host server for displaying a poster which showed Bush with a swastika on his right buttock and a cruise missile coming out of his rear.</p>",
  "<p>In the wake of the latest tragic shooting in Finland (Gunman kills 10 at Finnish college, September 24), EU member states must urgently implement the EU law on the control of the acquisition and possession of weapons. This law would ensure that firearms are only licensed to people who do not represent a threat to public safety. This requires a background check and assessment to ensure someone seeking a licence is not mentally unstable and has not committed or been convicted of a violent crime. </p> <p>Citizens will rightly demand to know why it takes two tragic shootings and the deaths of many children for legislators in Finland to take action and tighten their lax gun laws (Comment, September 25). The importance of gun control is clear in a country with over 1.8m guns in circulation in a population of 5 million people. It is inconceivable that police interviewed the shooter due to concerns about images of him on YouTube firing a gun and did not remove his firearm. My committee recognised these risks and legislated for tougher provisions on access to weapons. These proved to be among the most difficult areas to get agreement on, especially with those member states which have a tradition of hunting and shooting clubs. They have now proved to be the most essential to put in place to protect innocent, law-abiding citizens.<br><strong>Arlene McCarthy MEP</strong><br>Chair, consumer protection committee</p>",

In the interests of transparency, the OFT has written to all parties, providing an update on the investigation.\"</p> <p>However, the watchdog said it was \"inappropriate to give any further detail at this stage\" and one supermarket executive who had seen the letter dismissed it as \"standard issue\".</p> <p>None of the companies has been accused of breaking the law but, if it is eventually concluded that a cartel has been operating, the companies involved could be fined up to 10% of annual turnover. </p> <p>It is the biggest cartel inquiry undertaken by the OFT and was prompted by Asda, which uncovered information when going through internal email records last summer. The supermarket's examination of its email trail was ordered by the Competition Commission, which was seeking evidence of suppliers being badly treated by grocers as part of its investigation into the grocery sector.</p> <p>In the wake of Asda's alert, the OFT raided Tesco, Sainsbury's, Morrisons, Asda and Procter &amp; Gamble. P&amp;G, whose brands include Duracell, Gillette and Pampers , is the world's biggest consumer goods firm. At the time of the raids, in April, P&amp;G said it was company policy \"to fully abide by the letter and spirit of the law\".</p> <p>The supermarkets also said they would cooperate fully. </p> <p>The watchdog demanded information from other companies, including Reckitt Benckiser, GlaxoSmithKline, Nestl\u00e9, Mars, Coca-Cola, Unilever and Cadbury. Unilever's product portfolio includes Dove soap, Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream and Domestos. Reckitt Benckiser counts Cillit Bang, Dettol and Clearasil among its brands.</p> <p>It is understood the inquiry is focused on whether the information-sharing broke the same laws that led to sportswear suppliers and retailers being hit with multimillion-pound fines over the pricing of replica football kits. That inquiry was also prompted by an internal whistleblower: Sports Direct billionaire and Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley.</p> <p>The inquiry into supermarkets and their suppliers covers a range of products, such as pasta sauce, toothpaste, tea and moisturising cream.</p> <p>The OFT's raids sparked an angry reaction from the supermarket industry, which said it was being unfairly targeted by watchdogs. One senior food retailer accused the regulator of embarking on a \"fishing expedition\" as it had asked for such a wide range of information.</p> <p>The raids came a day after the OFT had apologised, and paid \u00a3100,000 plus costs, to Morrisons to settle a defamation suit. The regulator admitted it had been wrong to accuse the company of fixing the price of butter and cheese.</p> <p>However, several grocers and dairy suppliers, including Sainsbury's, Arla, Dairy Crest and Robert Wiseman, have paid some \u00a3120m in fines after admitting involvement in milk market price fixing.</p> <p>Another OFT inquiry, into collaboration between supermarkets and tobacco firms on cigarette prices, is still ongoing.</p>",
  "<p>The government's plan, reported yesterday, to end the exclusion of Roman Catholics from the British throne and put women on an equal footing with men in the line of succession is a victory for the Guardian, which has been advocating these reforms since the turn of the millennium. And in principle the Guardian is right. Whether or not the 1701 Act of Settlement is found to be in conflict with the Human Rights Act, it feels quite wrong in today's climate that anybody should be barred from any office by reason of sex or religion (even though, as it so happens, the dominant and longest-serving monarchs of the past two centuries have been women, Victoria and Elizabeth II). </p> <p>But it seems that, while the government and the Guardian agree that these constitutional changes are needed, their motives are different. The government has given no indication of wanting to abolish the monarchy, whereas the Guardian has argued that the monarchy's value is questionable and should at some stage be openly debated and determined by the will of the people. And to make the point again, Geoffrey Robertson QC, the lawyer who has been representing this paper in matters monarchical, said yesterday that \"the next stage\" would be for the government to challenge the notion of a hereditary head of state. So it would appear that the government's aim is to modernise the monarchy with a view to its perpetuation, while the Guardian's is gently to foster the growth of republican sentiment.</p> <p>And though, as I say, the proposed reforms are right in principle, their effects in the short term would be more likely than not to serve the Guardian's purposes. They would mean, for example, that the ecumenically minded Prince Charles could convert to Catholicism or any of the other faiths he aspires to defend without sacrificing his position as heir to the throne, however unpopular that might make him. And they could revive the claims of German princelings whose Catholicism has hitherto excluded them from the succession. In fact, there are those who believe that our rightful next king should be neither Prince Charles nor any of his close relations but a 75-year-old Bavarian duke, Franz von Bayern, who is the closest blood descendant of King Charles I. The resurrection of a bunch of unknown German claimants would hardly raise the monarchy in public esteem, which the Guardian must have known eight years ago when it advertised in a German newspaper to invite their support for its legal challenge to the Act of Settlement. </p> <p>I think it is right, and probably inevitable, that at some stage, after the Queen dies, the future of the monarchy will be determined by the people in a referendum. But it will be bad luck on our battered royal family if a sensible reform turns out to make the monarchy look even more ridiculous than it has often looked during the past 30 years.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>It is the height of poignancy that Jean Charles de Menezes should have felt so well-disposed towards the British police. Giving evidence at his inquest this week, a member of his family said that he had always found British police officers \"very polite\"; and that, although they had stopped him for no obvious reason on four occasions before shooting him dead on a London Underground train on July 22 2005, he had never resented this. \"We come from Brazil and it is very common for police to stop people there,\" his cousin, Alex Pereira, told the coroner's court. </p> <p>De Menezes realised that his looks might expose him to suspicion after the London terrorist bombings, and he didn't even resent that. He told a cousin that they should \"pray and hope not to be in the wrong place at the wrong time\", which, in the event, was exactly what happened to him. But despite such fears, he was \"very happy in England\" and probably intended to stay here permanently, according to Pereira.</p> <p>Most people's reaction to being stopped in the street by a police officer would be one of fear or anxiety, but there are immigrants such as De Menezes who come here from tougher societies and see such treatment as routine. He seems to have regarded Britain, in contrast to Brazil, as a humane and tolerant place. This makes his death even sadder.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>David Miliband's overheard Heseltine reference at the Labour party conference, when he is alleged to have said that he had toned down his speech to avoid a \"Heseltine moment\", was not, if true, his first. He later denied it, but he clearly has Heseltine on his mind. Only a few days earlier, in a magazine interview, he cited the great Tory showman. Asked if he saw himself becoming Labour leader one day, he replied that he didn't know. \"I've not done a Michael Heseltine and written my life-course on an envelope,\" he said, referring to the story that Heseltine, while still a student, had predicted his future with the words \"millionaire 25, cabinet member 35, party leader 45, prime minister 55\". Heseltine did achieve the first two of these objectives, but was stymied on the last two by Margaret Thatcher and John Major. He was never to become either party leader or prime minister.</p> <p>That he should talk about him at all seems to me surprising and indicative that he is actually very serious about succeeding Gordon Brown as leader of the Labour party. Heseltine would not be his role model but an example of how not to achieve his ambition. Never forget how Hezza blew it, is perhaps <br>his guiding principle.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>This week Alexander greatly enjoyed Eileen Atkins' wicked portrayal of Germaine Greer in Joanna Murray-Smith's comedy, The Female of the Species. He also went to English National Opera to see Cavalleria Rusticana and Pagliacci: \"Both musically delightful, but setting the tragedy of the jealous clown in 1970s Britain led to many unnecessary anomalies.\"</p>",
  "<p>In his later years, Charlie Chaplin made a film called Limelight that belatedly teamed him up with Buster Keaton. It bowed out with a poignant musical number in which the two old rivals took to the stage, stoking the embers of past glories and stirring memories of the way they were. I was reminded of this scene while watching Righteous Kill, a leaden police procedural thriller that's notable only for the fact that it stars Robert De Niro and Al Pacino - two titans of the American Method school, together at last. They deserved a better showcase than this. </p> <p>De Niro and Pacino play Turk and Rooster, a pair of jaded New York cops on the trail of a serial killer. The killer appears to be targeting pimps and child abusers - the urban scumbags who beat the system. Suspicion eventually falls on the curmudgeonly Turk, much to the horror of Rooster, who regards his partner as a role model. There are stand-offs and shoot-outs, stake-outs and fist fights. But the plot feels perfunctory, as though it was penned in haste after the players signed on. The inevitable gun-toting finale is not so much a twist as a kind of arthritic waddle, a sloughing off of awkward baggage.</p> <p>These two actors performed separately (split by a generation) in The Godfather: Part II and then squared off briefly over coffee in Michael Mann's Heat. But Righteous Kill is the first film to feature them as a double act- and don't think it doesn't know it. Significantly, director Jon Avnet chooses to open with an extended, swooning montage that pits his players in macho competition. We watch them duelling on the shooting range, pumping iron on adjacent benches, and tussling tight-lipped over a chessboard. Were it not for the demands of that pesky plot, this montage would have probably gone on ad infinitum, and Avnet would have had them arm-wrestling, racing on bicycles and working out who can spit the furthest. </p> <p>All of this is fine, so far as it goes. There is a certain residual pleasure to be had from watching these heavyweights going toe-to-toe; seeing how one man's style matches up against the others. Despite their similar backgrounds, their parallel career paths, they remain very different beasts. Righteous Kill gives us the geyser versus the pressure cooker. Throughout it all, Pacino's flamboyant, declamatory aggression struggles to find a chink in his rival's coiled and watchful defence. </p> <p>And so it goes, the contest swinging first one way and then the other while Avnet accommodates them like a weak referee. At the end, our combatants pause for breath and take stock of their situation. \"We did good,\" murmurs Pacino and De Niro echoes him: \"Yeah, we did good.\" But they sound as though they are trying to convince themselves. They require a bigger stage, a sharper script and a more rigorous director. Without these, the long-awaited De Niro/Pacino show amounts to nothing so much as a novelty bout, a celebrity sparring session. Its sound and fury signifies very little.</p>",
  "<p>The full weight of European law looks set to bear down on agents as the European Union strives to eliminate the risks of child trafficking and money-laundering that taint the transfer market. Last week the European Commission invited tenders for what will be the most influential information-gathering exercise on the activities of sports' middlemen. The winning bid will have the opportunity to shape the future of the commission's approach to rogue agents, with the possibility of new laws to govern them not ruled out. </p> <p>The study into agents' activities, one of the key objectives of the European white paper on sport, comes as the commission and its member states recognise the inefficacy of Fifa rules governing player agents.</p> <p>\"The study must, without fail, determine whether there are problems with the application of the existing rules,\" said the terms of reference of the invitation to tender. \"If so, explain what these problems are, how significant they are (e.g. number of cases), which member states are concerned and what sports are concerned.\" That will surely lead to specific investigation of the approach of football's governing body. One man who is certain to offer his opinions on the issue is Michel Platini. The Uefa president has been outspoken about the risks sport faces and the perception is that rogue agents facilitate much of football's vices. </p> <p>\"Society has passed scourges on to the world of sport: money-laundering, match-fixing, illegal betting, racism and xenophobia, doping and child trafficking,\" he has said.</p> <h2>Eastern promise</h2> <p>Poland and Ukraine will today be granted a reprieve over their Euro 2012 ambitions, despite the dissolution of Ukraine's government and presidential allegations of sabotage of the nation's efforts to build the showpiece stadium to host the final. Two high-level Uefa delegations to Ukraine and Poland highlighted the alarming infrastructure challenges those nations face but the hands of the tournament organiser seem tied. Fears of hooliganism preclude Italy hosting the competition, and England's ambitions to hold the 2018 World Cup mean the Football Association will not offer itself as a fall-back.</p> <h2>Kaiser's slip</h2> <p>Franz Beckenbauer's concentration could never be faulted on the football field but his ability to focus throughout eight hours of procedural debate is not quite the same. The Kaiser emerged from yesterday's Uefa executive-committee meeting to confirm to German television that a decision had been reached on the expansion of the Euro 2016 tournament to 24 teams. Reporters approached one of Uefa's most senior executives to clarify the decision and were asked: \"Which meeting was he in?\" The vote is point 6 on the meeting's agenda: yesterday's discussions reached only point 5.8, although the motion will certainly be passed today.</p> <h2>Race time</h2> <p>One item that might now be added to the any-other-business section of today's agenda is Fifa's disgraceful indifference to the racism of Croatia fans towards Emile Heskey in this month's World Cup qualifier. Croatia's federation - after its third such offence - was fined \u20ac18,800 (\u00a314,950), even though Uefa's zero-tolerance procedures allow for the expulsion from tournaments of teams whose fans commit racist offences. Uefa hopes now to embody mandatory expulsions for offending clubs through its club-licensing provisions. </p> <h2>Capello pays homage</h2> <p>Fabio Capello, below, might be England's capo di tutti capi but there is one man to whom even he defers. The England manager attended the international coaches' conference in Vienna on Wednesday and paid tribute to Uefa's technical director, Andy Roxburgh, who was coordinating the affair. Capello and the Scot, whom he called \"the Professor\", have stayed in touch since the early 1980s when Roxburgh, then the Scottish Football Association's technical director, acted as his host during a fact-finding visit to Clyde.</p>",
  "<p>As someone who doesn't have the time to watch much television back home in Britain, I have been attempting to profit from my stay in the US, a country where television is, to quote an early 1990s hip-hop lyric, the drug of the nation. As a result, I have a newfound passion for channel surfing. But other than an attack of tendonitis in my thumb and index finger, I have to confess that I have gleaned little else from the experience - save for a sense of disillusionment at the paucity of decent media coverage of the US election.</p> <p>At first sight, there appears to be a smorgasbord of coverage on offer in the US, a profusion of political stances to captivate the attention and acumen of the average viewer. <em>Quot homines, tot sententiae</em>, from NBC to BET, via ABC and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WBLS\">WBLS</a>. Or so I thought. But on closer inspection, it soon becomes evident that what we really have here is limited to a tedious and stifling binary opposition.</p> <p>In the red corner, there is the truly execrable <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/oreilly/index.html\">Bill O'Reilly</a> (who makes Britain's Jeremy Clarkson look like a dulcet cherub) with the eponymous O'Reilly Factor on Fox News - the unofficial Republican party mouthpiece that moonlights as a TV channel. In fact, Fox's reportage was deemed so racist by rap superstar Nas that he denounced and subsequently <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2008/07/23/nas-delivers-petition-to-fox-news-says-network-is-scared/\">delivered a petition</a> to their offices, citing the instances of the onscreen graphic that referred to Michelle Obama as the senator's \"baby mama\", Bill O'Reilly using the phrase \"lynching party\" to refer to attacks on the senator's wife and referring to the couple's famous touching of fists as a \"terrorist fist jab\". </p> <p>And in the blue corner, <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3036677/\">Keith Olbermann</a> is the bruised face of the liberal, left-leaning MSNBC, a channel which unashamedly possesses a clear Obama bias. Add to that the Huffington Post and the Daily Kos blogs respectively as the towel and cut men, and the Democrat corner is complete. And somewhere in the middle of the ring, shuffling laboriously about between the bloodied pugilists, stopping occasionally to check its timepiece, is the ostensibly neutral, bumbling referee, <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/\">CNN</a>.</p> <p>US media coverage of the election seems to work on the principal of Manichean polarity \u2013 which is fitting for such a vehemently religious culture. But who is the St Augustine we need to save us from this dualistic peril? To label the election coverage here as simplistic is to insult simplicity. It is essentially both facile and reductive. Nothing, not even following a cue ball in Harlem, can ever be this black and white. </p> <p>Where, I find myself asking forlornly, is the witty repartee and the ineluctable tension derived from an agonistic bout of cerebral jousting in an interview with the likes of John Humphries on BBC Radio 4's Today program? Where is the delectable schadenfreude to be had from witnessing the sneering, sardonic Jeremy Paxman intellectually mauling an interlocutor on Newsnight? Where is the brio and vim of incisive reportage which injects excitement into even the most mundane and quotidian of British political contests?</p> <p>Instead, here in the US I have been watching coverage which at best can be described as worryingly dichromatic, and at worse meretricious, a coverage which is of course indicative of the shibboleths of American society at large. </p> <p>This, it has to be said, is not a culture which is known for its deft use of nuance, let alone for a concerted and meaningful level of sophistication when it comes to political analysis. It is a culture which, on so many levels, genuflects before the altar of the shallow and the superficial. It is a culture which obsesses over fripperies and fetishises the aesthetic over and above the cerebral. Can you imagine as many column inches being devoted to the size of Gordon Brown's expanding waistline or the way David Cameron cuts his hair as to those expended on whether <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/08/01/wsj-obama-may-be-too-thin_n_116266.html\">Obama is too thin to be president</a> or the significance of <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=5725791\">Sarah Palin's dress sense?</a> (As if any of these factors are in any way indicative of their ability to run the country). Even the recent disingenuous linguistic manipulation which resulted in the \"lipstick on a pig\" controversy highlights where the emphasis of the coverage is being placed.</p> <p>Balance, equality and (most conspicuously) nuance have all been left at the door and refused entry to the party. Instead, strident but essentially vacuous comment and heavily partisan, intellectually vapid reportage lewdly gyrate together in the middle of the dance floor. Over here in the US, style is everything, and substance is nothing. Back home in the UK, we understand the importance of that famous classical adage <em>ars est celare artem</em>. Over here in the US, I am not sure they possess the skill, let alone the skill to hide the skill.</p> <p>The delicate sensibilities of political hermeneutics as evidenced in the UK are all but lost on Americans, where to be honest there is no mass market culture of refined, equitable socio-political exegesis. With their faux tans, well-fitting suits deliberately flattering their rotund girths and de rigeur black- framed glasses which are worn to help cultivate a conscious air of gravitas, political commentators as plasticy as their rictus smiles pour forth verbiage with a disconcerting tedium, imperiously hectoring their audiences one way or the other. If British commentators have been known to write with quills, their American counterparts write with sledgehammers.</p> <p>Come back Auntie BBC \u2013 all is forgiven. Yes, even the risible waste of licence fee payer's money you spend on retaining the services of the remarkably pedestrian Jonathan Ross and the spectacularly odious Jeremy Clarkson! Vive the Beeb, where the closest we get to theatrical affectation invading the reportage is the sight of Andrew Marr raising an eyebrow or the harmless swingometer of Peter Snow.</p> <p>I do wonder what Jeremy Paxman would make of it all? Although clearly guilty of being, in that memorable phrase of Quintillian, \"too much a lover of his own cleverness\", he would at least, one feels, rise to this auspicious occasion. \"Yeeeeeeeeeeeesssssssssss \u2026\"</p> <p>I can hear the trademark sardonic sneer ringing in my ears now. And in the case of this election coverage, it would be wholly deserving.</p>",
  "<p>Hong Kong's <a href=\"http://www.cfs.gov.hk/english/whatsnew/whatsnew_fstr/whatsnew_fstr_Melamine_in_Mainland_Milk_Powder_Incident.html\">Centre for Food Safety</a> has found <a href=\"http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2008-09/21/content_7045016.htm\">traces of melamine</a> in Nestle's 1kg packs of milk supplied to the local catering industry. The products, made in Qingdao, China, were recalled by Nestle, which expressed regret in causing anxieties among the public. However, <a href=\"http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jI1PeFM988pC3bbnaUsdAf6tPdRg\">AFP reported on Monday</a> that Nestle had released a statement claming its Chinese products are free from adulteration with melamine. Nestle also said the level of melamine found is lower than the new food safety standard and safe to consume. </p> <p>Technically speaking, the Nestle milk is safe to drink. The Hong Kong government believes the level of melamine is low, while still advising against its use by small children. Meanwhile, health officials pointed out that melamine exists in the human food chain anyway. For example, pesticides often contain melamine. Cows or pigs fed with pesticide-treated grass will have melamine residue in their bodies. It is impossible to reach zero-level melamine. </p> <p>Despite this explanation, the government has passed emergency legislation that will impose an even stricter regime on the industry. Under the new law, manufacturers and importers will face prosecution if melamine levels are found to be higher than the allowed level. </p> <p>The question is, if zero melamine is impossible, why is it only found in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/23/china.milk.scandal\">some dairy products</a>? Among Nestle's products, why is melamine only found in those dairy products made in mainland China? And if the source of the melamine is in the milk, then can we say this is a consequence of the use of cheap raw materials? </p> <p>Multinationals come to China to take advantage of its cheap labour and materials, and at the same time, to reach the large domestic market. Most of the multinationals have gone through the process of sourcing the materials locally for the local market. In such cases, whether a multinational can maintain its usual high standards is a challenge for the company's management, and even a test of its morality. </p> <p>About six months ago, I discussed the phenomenon that when looking at the products made in China for international brands, one can find a gap in quality and price between those made for the Chinese market and those for the overseas market. Many Chinese consumers have noticed the difference. It is curious to see many Chinese people coming back from an overseas trip, bringing with them things made in China, which can also be bought in China. It looks like only those made in China but sold abroad represent real good value. </p> <p>Now it looks like the same is happening in the dairy industry. Multinationals will always make revenue the top priority. That's business. However, because the legislation in China still has many loopholes, multinationals often use different standards when they deal with their business in China. A report published by Greenpeace in April revealed that among 100 companies surveyed, 28 had opened plants in China, but only half of them released the pollution information of these China-based plants. </p> <p>According to the official investigation, the Sanlu Group received its first complaint about its dairy products last December. Melamine was identified in June. During the first eight months of this year, Sanlu Group neither reported the case nor rectified the problem. New Zealand prime minister Helen Clark this week revealed the slow reaction of Fonterra, a New Zealand company and minority shareholder of Sanlu Group. Fonterra informally contacted New Zealand's embassy in Beijing on August 14, and eight days later formally asked Chinese authorities to recall the products through its diplomatic channel. Clark was only told the news on September 5. </p> <p>Checking carefully the timeline, one should ask, as a shareholder with 43% shares and three representatives sitting on the board, when Fonterra first knew about the problem? If Sanlu Group deliberately covered up evidence then whether Fonterra and its three board members should take any responsibility is a question that has to be answered in front of a judge. </p> <p>In a broader sense, this incident reminds multinationals that if they think they can use double standards in China in order to maximise revenues, they will have to face the consequences one day.</p> <p><em>This article has been cross-posted and appears here for the first time in English.

  "<p>A $700bn bail-out for Wall Street appeared to have stalled last night after an acrimonious White House summit attended by the two presidential candidates, John McCain and Barack Obama, to resolve the crisis.</p> <p>Wall Street stocks surged as investors anticipated that a deal would ultimately emerge. But after markets closed, George Bush met congressional leaders as well as the two presidential candidates for talks that failed to clinch the deal.</p> <p>Speaking at the start of the summit held to break the congressional deadlock, Bush said: \"We are in a serious economic crisis in the country if we don't pass a piece of legislation ... My hope is that we can reach an agreement very shortly.\"</p> <p>He was reflecting optimism earlier in the day when Democratic and Republican leaders in the Senate and House of Representatives agreed in principle to Bush's bail-out plan.</p> <p>But by the time Bush held his summit hours later much of that goodwill had dissipated. The Democrats blamed the disruption on the intervention of McCain.</p> <p>The Republican candidate wrested the political agenda from Obama on Wednesday by suspending his campaign and saying he would fly to Washington to help end the stalemate. He also called for tonight's presidential debate against Obama in Oxford, Mississippi, to be postponed.</p> <p>Last night, McCain said he was still optimistic that a deal could be concluded in time for him to attend the debate today. Obama too said he thought a deal would still be reached. \"I think eventually we are going to get a deal. There is still work to be done.\" Criticising McCain, he said presidential politics should not be interjected into delicate negotiations. Other Democrats were even more scathing of McCain's manoeuvres. \"What this looked like to me was a rescue plan for John McCain,\" Christopher Dodd told CNN.</p> <p>The need for urgency in tackling the financial crisis was reinforced by more dire news from the US, with unemployment at its highest level for seven years, house sales at their lowest level since 1991 and one of the biggest corporate names in America, General Electric, issuing a profits warning because of \"unprecedented weakness and volatility in the financial services market\". Nonetheless, the Dow Jones industrial average jumped almost 2% to close at 11,022, reflecting expectations of a deal.</p> <p>The deal agreed in principle earlier in the day included restrictions on million-dollar payouts for bankers forced out of their jobs. There is also a mechanism for the government to take an equity stake in some firms, so taxpayers have a chance to profit if the bail-out plan works.</p> <p>With the US turmoil impacting on economies around the world, the prime minister, Gordon Brown, is due to make an unscheduled visit to Washington today to discuss the economy. He is likely to meet Bush for about 40 minutes, and is also expected to use the hastily arranged meeting to discuss the US request for extra British troops in Afghanistan.</p> <p>A White House summit between a president and the two candidates seeking to replace him is rare. Bush was flanked by congressional leaders at the meeting, as well as Obama and McCain, who sat at opposite ends of the cabinet table.</p> <p>Obama and McCain, having flown to Washington from the campaign trail, arrived at the White House at roughly the same time in motorcades, complete with their own press pools.</p>",
  "<p>It was known as the Golden Age of Hollywood, a time when movies defined who we were and what we did. But it was also the golden age of tobacco sponsorship of the movies, a time when the tobacco companies paid the stars of the day thousands of dollars - as well as a year's supply of cigarettes - to promote their products, on and off-screen.</p> <p>A new report shows that in 1937-8 Hollywood's brightest stars, including Gary Cooper, Joan Crawford, Clark Gable and Spencer Tracy, were each paid $10,000 - the equivalent of $146,000 in today's money - by American Tobacco to promote its Lucky Strike cigarette brand. That year alone, American paid $218,750 - more than $3m at today's prices - to film stars.</p> <p>The report published in the journal Tobacco Control says that almost 200 stars, including two-thirds of the top box office actors from the late 1930s and 1940s, were contracted to tobacco companies.</p> <p>The relationship, described in the report as a \"deliberately fostered association\" between cigarettes and the movies started with the advent of the talkies. </p> <p>In 1927 Al Jolson, star of The Jazz Singer pitched for Lucky Strike and his studio, Warner Bros.</p> <p>\"Talking pictures demand a clear voice,\" the star was quoted as saying in a newspaper advertisement lauding the \"toasting\" process used in making Lucky Strikes. \"Toasting kills off all the irritants, so my voice is clear as a bell in every scene. Folks, let me tell you, the good old flavour of Luckies is as sweet and soothing as the best 'Mammy' song ever written.\"</p> <p>That campaign was subsequently the subject of an inquiry by the US federal trade commission that concluded that American Tobacco's advertising was misleading.</p> <p>Others followed suit. The same year director King Vidor opined that, \"It is wonderful to find a cigarette that relaxes your nerves, and at the same time insures you against throat irritation - a condition from which film directors are bound to suffer.\"</p> <p>The promotion of cigarettes as sophisticated and healthy was a task that might have been created for the acting profession. </p> <p>Demonstrating the mutually beneficial relationship struck between studios and tobacco companies, in 1937 Carole Lombard was paid to say: \"In making Swing High, Swing Low there was an unusual strain on my throat ... I could smoke Luckies all day without the slightest throat irritation. Most others on the set also prefer them.\"</p> <p>The notion of Luckies as the tobacco of choice among film stars was one that American worked hard to create.</p> <p>\"It's always easy for me to get a Lucky from Joan Crawford or Clark Gable,\" Myrna Loy wrote in a signed testimonial in 1937, \"or even from most of the newcomers to the studio\".</p> <p>By the 1940s, the tobacco companies were sponsoring popular radio shows featuring the stars relaxing on set and talking about subjects as diverse as their new film and their favourite brand of cigarettes.</p> <p>\"You know Lauren, that cigarette I gave you is a Lucky Strike,\" Jack Benny told Lauren Bacall, the guest on his radio show in the first week of 1947, during the filming of To Have and Have Not.</p> <p>\"I know and it's my favourite brand, too,\" replies Bacall. \"They're so round ... so firm ... so fully packed ... so free and easy on the draw.\"</p> <p>Advertisers, says the report, worked hard to ensure that smoking was integral to film-making, and that smoke in a film came to be seen as evidence of artistic endeavour. The truth, argues the report, is that the relationship was created by commercial convenience.</p> <p>\"The legacy of cross-promotion during the Golden Age of Hollywood ... continues to be used to rationalise smoking as integral to the art of film-making. Evidence suggests that this integration was a commercial collaboration 'signed, sealed and delivered' by the tobacco companies, major studios and many of the era's best remembered stars.\"</p> <p>By the early 1950, with federal regulators closing in on advertisers, the tobacco industry switched its attention to the new mass medium of television to sell its products.</p> <p>But after a lull, says the report, by 1980 smoking on screen was making a comeback, despite increased knowledge of the dangers to health associated with smoking.</p> <p>The controversy over smoking on screen continues today, with the major studios involved in a patchwork of different approaches to the problem of how to regulate something that has become so bound up with notions of classic cinema.</p> <p>The report dismisses opponents of efforts to give films that include smoking an \"R\" or 18 rating.</p> <p>\"The presumption,\" says the report, \"is that mainstream motion pictures are an art form into which social agendas should not intrude. The pattern of close cooperation between the film and tobacco industries ... suggests instead that the motion picture industry was always ready to cater to the tobacco industry's commercial agenda.\"</p>",
  "<p>Amid the sound and fury and frightening price tag surrounding the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/25/wallstreet.useconomy\">proposed Wall Street bailout</a>, US government rescuers can take a simple step that would fight runaway corporate greed at the root of the crisis. This single reform would rein in excesses including obscene executive salaries and unreasonable risk to forestall future crises. </p> <p>Best of all, this reform won't need a cent of taxpayer money, and once enacted will reduce government regulation. The reform relies on a mechanism familiar to most members of the US Congress, at least in theory: grassroots democracy.</p> <p>One of the most effective and cheapest ways to regulate corporations is to let the owners to do it themselves. In the US, shareholders are supposed supervise the companies they own through elected boards of directors, but corporate trickery endorsed under the current rules puts management, not investors, in control of corporate boards. Clearing out these roadblocks to democracy will empower shareholders to supervise the companies they own. And owners won't stand for their money being squandered on $6,000 shower curtains or $46m golden parachutes. </p> <p>Anyone with enough money can buy a stock. But as John McCain's economic adviser <a href=\"http://voices.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2008/09/16/fiorina_palin_lacks_experience.html\">Carly Fiorina noted last week</a>, not everyone can run a major corporation. (Her work at Lucent and Hewlett Packard makes Fiorina an expert on the subject.) So owners hire specialists \u2013 executives \u2013 to operate the business for them. The system gives executives control of assets that don't belong to them. </p> <p>To address this situation, known in management science as the agency problem, US shareholders elect boards of directors to supervise company managers. Directors are legally bound to protect shareholder interests. They leave day-to-day operations to executives but provide broad oversight - approving strategic goals and directions, deciding ownership issues including mergers and acquisitions, hiring and firing the chief executive officer and setting executive compensation.</p> <p>Annual board elections are supposed to ensure that directors continue to represent shareholder interests. Shareholders receive a ballot, known as a proxy card, to vote for directors. Investors send back their proxy card (or, in most cases, don't), the votes are counted and elected directors ensure that managers take good care of the shareholders' property. </p> <p>That's how it's supposed to work. In practice, the inmates are running the asylum. Management, not shareholders, controls director elections and has turned boards of directors from watchdogs for investors into lapdogs for executive whims. Management seized power with the help of arcane and antiquated rules to establish a <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB115828645964263952.html?mod=todays_us_opinion\">Soviet-style election system</a> that perpetuates its grip. </p> <p>Under present rules, company executives, not shareholders, determine the nominees whose names appear on the company election ballot. Executives offer one nominee per slot, so nomination is tantamount to election. That makes directors beholden to the entrenched executives nominating them, not the shareholders ratifying them. </p> <p>To ensure management's nominees always win, only its choices appear on the company ballot sent to shareholders at company expense. If shareholders want to have a choice in the election, they have to send out their own ballot, at their own expense, a costly process that companies can load with hazards and hindrances, including expending shareholder money from the corporate treasury to mount lawsuits. Since director elections rarely present real choice, dissidents that clear the initial hurdles must spend thousands more to let shareholders know they are contesting the election. Such challenges rarely succeed.</p> <p>Directors effectively selected by management and owing their positions to management protect and respond to management, not shareholders. They rubber stamp massive executives pay packages and don't vigorously challenge strategic decisions. Having company CEOs routinely serving directors, often chairing the board, where their primary mission is to supervise themselves, vividly illustrates that most boards are performing a parody of their intended function. Lack of ownership oversight as well as government regulation enabled the corporate excesses and errors at the root of the present financial crisis. </p> <p>\"We've always said that excessively high levels of CEO compensation is a symptom of failed corporate governance that would come back to haunt us,\" said Rich Ferlauto, director of pension investment policy for the <a href=\"http://www.afscme.org/\">American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees</a>. \"And we were right.\"</p> <p>Congress can end this madness by enabling free and fair elections that let investors freely choose boards of directors that really represent them. The easy fix is to open the corporate ballot to shareholder nominees on equal terms with management's. That would give shareholders a meaningful role in choosing who supervises their investments. It would make directors accountable to shareholders, either spurring them to fulfil their obligation to protect investor interests or facilitating their replacement with directors that will. </p> <p>This simple reform is <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/managing/content/mar2008/ca20080313_866458.htm?chan=careers_managing+your+board+page_corporate+governance\">\"the holy grail\" of corporate governance reform</a>, according to AFSCME's Ferlauto. In 2003, after compliant corporate boards enabled the Enron, WorldCom, Tyco and other debacles, the US securities and exchange commission (SEC) proposed opening the company ballot to one or two large shareholder nominees. Investors would get a choice between candidates on a single ballot, and at least some directors would need votes from shareholders and be motivated to protect investor interests. </p> <p>That nod toward free and fair elections didn't satisfy investor rights advocates, but it scared the hell out of corporate executives. They realised that losing absolute control of the board would make them accountable to shareholders. They mounted a desperate public and private effort to defeat the measure. Their most ludicrous argument was that contested elections would open board membership to \"special interests\". Calling the owners of the company \"special interests\" underscores executives' conviction that companies belong to them, not shareholders. It also demonstrates fear that most management nominees couldn't win a fair vote. <br> Even though the proposal generated the largest volume of public comment, nearly all of it favourable, in SEC history, corporate lobbyists (paid with shareholders' money) managed to kill the measure. But AFSCME, whose members have billions in pension funds invested in the stock market, didn't give up. The government workers' union filed resolutions for votes at companies where they believed poor director oversight was putting investors' equity at risk, including current crisis stars AIG and Bear Stearns. </p> <p>AFSCME's efforts prompted a court decision that <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2007/nov/29/business/fi-shareholders29\">forced the SEC to vote last November</a>. The commission's three Republican members outvoted the single Democrat (one Democratic seat was vacant) to bar shareholder access to the ballot. AFSCME <a href=\"http://www.afscme.org/press/17494.cfm\">refiled its proposal</a> this year at Bear Stearns, and when the SEC staff allowed Bear to knock it off the ballot, the union sued. \"We were on the way to court that Monday when Bear Stearns went under,\" Ferlauto recalled.</p> <p>Now the union is pursuing the reform in Congress, and Wall Street's crisis presents an opportunity to speed the process. According to Ferlauto, the first draft of the rescue bill from the House financial services committee chaired by Democrat Barney Frank would require companies receiving bailout funds to <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSN2150844420080921\">limit executive pay</a> and open the company ballot to directors nominated by shareholders representing 3% of the company. </p> <p>\"This is the foot in the door,\" Ferlauto said. He envisions Congress including opening the company ballot for all corporations as part of a broader regulatory reform package early next year. </p> <p>Executives certainly won't give up their ludicrous pay packets and excessive power without a fight. As happened with the Enron-era scandals, corporations and their lobbyists will lay low until the furore subsides, then do their best to scuttle reform. They'll say it's socialist and un-American to give shareholders real power to supervise the companies they own. </p> <p>But investor oversight is a cornerstone of American shareholder capitalism the way it's supposed to operate. This crisis presents Congress with an opportunity to make corporate America an offer it can't refuse.</p>",
  "<p>Congressional leaders closed in today on a deal to inject $700bn into the flagging US financial markets after getting a political jolt from the two presidential candidates' arrival in Washington.</p> <p>The outlines of a bail-out agreement emerged hours before a White House meeting that was orchestrated to give John McCain and Barack Obama a chance to weigh in on the nation's economic crisis.</p> <p>The prospect of both candidates appearing during bail-out talks \u2013 an infusion of presidential politics that McCain called for yesterday \u2013 appears to have spurred congressional negotiators toward a quicker-than-anticipated consensus. </p> <p>Chris Dodd, the Democratic chairman of the Senate banking committee, told reporters that a \"fundamental agreement\" had been reached, although he cautioned that specific legislative language was not yet finalised.</p> <p>\"We believe we are prepared to act expeditiously ... and send a message to the markets,\" Dodd said.</p> <p>The markets responded in kind, as Wall Street opened sharply higher than yesterday and by 5pm BST was up more than 2.1%, or 225 points. The FTSE 100 posted a similar pattern, closing 101.5 points higher at 5197, for a rise of 2%.</p> <p>Democrats, following on Obama remarks yesterday, conceded one of their original goals for the bail-out by agreeing not to allow US bankruptcy judges to modify the terms of primary mortgages.</p> <p>The omission of that bankruptcy provision could push liberals to vote against the bail-out when it comes up for a vote, perhaps as soon as tomorrow. </p> <p>Conservatives remain equally reticent, decrying the financial rescue as an abdication of capitalism, but the plan can still pass while losing votes on the left and right.</p> <p>Democratic and Republican leaders are agreed on shepherding the bail-out deal into law, although both sides are eager to twist the outcome as much as possible to help their respective presidential candidates.</p> <p>John Boehner, leading Republican in the House of Representatives, gave McCain credit for jump-starting the process by urging a delay in the presidential debate and asking Obama to return to Washington for a meeting with George Bush.</p> <p>\"John McCain's call to suspend the campaign to come back here \u2026 will, in fact, help speed up the process,\" Boehner told reporters today. \"It clearly lays more urgency on the Congress to act.\"</p> <p>Senior Democrats such as Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader, were equally adamant that McCain's leap into the bail-out fray had hurt their efforts to reach consensus.</p> <p>\"If we lose progress on this because of one person, that's John McCain,\" Reid told reporters today. \"He's standing in the way.\"</p> <p>The emergence of a pact, even if only in principle, clears the way for McCain and Obama to claim the mantle of leadership at their White House meeting, scheduled for 9pm BST. </p> <p>But if Congress is already beginning to debate a bail-out agreement by tomorrow, the path is also cleared for the debate to continue as planned, in an undeniable setback for McCain.</p>",
  "<p>Israel gave serious thought this spring to launching a military strike on Iran's nuclear sites but was told by President George W Bush that he would not support it and did not expect to revise that view for the rest of his presidency, senior European diplomatic sources have told the Guardian. </p> <p>The then prime minister, Ehud Olmert, used the occasion of Bush's trip to Israel for the 60th anniversary of the state's founding to raise the issue in a one-on-one meeting on May 14, the sources said. \"He took it [the refusal of a US green light] as where they were at the moment, and that the US position was unlikely to change as long as Bush was in office\", they added.</p> <p> The sources work for a European head of government who met the Israeli leader some time after the Bush visit. Their talks were so sensitive that no note-takers attended, but the European leader subsequently divulged to his officials the highly sensitive contents of what Olmert had told him of Bush's position.</p> <p> Bush's decision to refuse to offer any support for a strike on Iran appeared to be based on two factors, the sources said. One was US concern over Iran's likely retaliation, which would probably include a wave of attacks on US military and other personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as on shipping in the Persian Gulf. </p> <p>The other was US anxiety that Israel would not succeed in disabling Iran's nuclear facilities in a single assault even with the use of dozens of aircraft. It could not mount a series of attacks over several days without risking full-scale war. So the benefits would not outweigh the costs. </p> <p>Iran has repeatedly said it would react with force to any attack. Some western government analysts believe this could include asking Lebanon's Shia movement Hizbollah to strike at the US. </p> <p>\"It's over ten years since Hizbollah's last terror strike outside Israel, when it hit an Argentine-Israel association building in Buenos Aires [killing 85 people]\", said one official. \"There is a large Lebanese diaspora in Canada which must include some Hizbollah supporters. They could slip into the United States and take action\". </p> <p>Even if Israel were to launch an attack on Iran without US approval its planes could not reach their targets without the US becoming aware of their flightpath and having time to ask them to abandon their mission. </p> <p>\"The shortest route to Natanz lies across Iraq and the US has total control of Iraqi airspace\", the official said. Natanz, about 100 miles north of Isfahan, is the site of an uranium enrichment plant. </p> <p>In this context Iran would be bound to assume Bush had approved it, even if the White House denied fore-knowledge, raising the prospect of an attack against the US. <br> Several high-level Israeli officials have hinted over the last two years that Israel might strike Iran's nuclear facilities to prevent them being developed to provide sufficient weapons-grade uranium to make a nuclear bomb. Iran has always denied having such plans. </p> <p>Olmert himself raised the possibility of an attack at a press conference during a visit to London last November, when he said sanctions were not enough to block Iran's nuclear programme. </p> <p>\"Economic sanctions are effective. They have an important impact already, but they are not sufficient. So there should be more. Up to where? Up until Iran will stop its nuclear programme,\" he said.</p> <p>The revelation that Olmert was not merely sabre-rattling to try to frighten Iran but considered the option seriously enough to discuss it with Bush shows how concerned Israeli officials had become. </p> <p>Bush's refusal to support an attack, and the strong suggestion he would not change his mind, is likely to end speculation that Washington might be preparing an \"October surprise\" before the US presidential election. Some analysts have argued that Bush would back an Israeli attack in an effort to help John McCain's campaign by creating an eve-of-poll security crisis. </p> <p>Others have said that in the case of an Obama victory, the vice-president, Dick Cheney, the main White House hawk, would want to cripple Iran's nuclear programme in the dying weeks of Bush's term.</p> <p>During Saddam Hussein's rule in 1981, Israeli aircraft successfully destroyed Iraq's nuclear reactor at Osirak shortly before it was due to start operating. </p> <p>Last September they knocked out a buildings complex in northern Syria, which US officials later said had been a partly constructed nuclear reactor based on a North Korean design. Syria said the building was a military complex but had no links to a nuclear programme. </p> <p>In contrast, Iran's nuclear facilities, which are officially described as intended only for civilian purposes, are dispersed around the country and some are in fortified bunkers underground.</p> <p>In public, Bush gave no hint of his view that the military option had to be excluded. In a speech to the Knesset the following day he confined himself to telling Israel's parliament: \"America stands with you in firmly opposing Iran's nuclear weapons ambitions. Permitting the world's leading sponsor of terror to possess the world's deadliest weapon would be an unforgivable betrayal of future generations. For the sake of peace, the world must not allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon.''</p> <p>Mark Regev, Olmert's spokesman, tonight reacted to the Guardian's story saying: \"The need to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons is raised at every meeting between the prime minister and foreign leaders. Israel prefers a diplomatic solution to this issue but all options must remain on the table. Your unnamed European source attributed words to the prime minister that were not spoken in any working meeting with foreign guests\". </p> <p>Three weeks after Bush's red light, on June 2, Israel mounted a massive air exercise covering several hundred miles in the eastern Mediterranean. It involved dozens of warplanes, including F-15s, F-16s and aerial refueling tankers. </p> <p>The size and scope of the exercise ensured that the US and other nations in the region saw it, said a US official, who estimated the distance was about the same as from Israel to Natanz. </p> <p>A few days later, Israel's deputy prime minister, Shaul Mofaz, told the paper Yediot Ahronot: \"If Iran continues its programme to develop nuclear weapons, we will attack it. The window of opportunity has closed. The sanctions are not effective. There will be no alternative but to attack Iran in order to stop the Iranian nuclear programme.\" </p> <p>The exercise and Mofaz's comments may have been designed to boost the Israeli government and military's own morale as well, perhaps, to persuade Bush to reconsider his veto. Last week Mofaz narrowly lost a primary within the ruling Kadima party to become Israel's next prime minister. Tzipi Livni, who won the contest, takes a less hawkish position. </p> <p>The US announced two weeks ago that it would sell Israel 1,000 bunker-busting bombs. The move was interpreted by some analysts as a consolation prize for Israel after Bush told Olmert of his opposition to an attack on Iran. But it could also enhance Israel's attack options in case the next US president revives the military option. </p> <p>The guided bomb unit-39 (GBU-39) has a penetration capacity equivalent to a one-tonne bomb. Israel already has some bunker-busters.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337989061\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2008/09/25/26.09.08.Iran.nuclear.gif\" alt=\"Iran nuclear map\" width=\"468\" height=\"340\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Map showing nuclear activity in Iran</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graphic</span> </figcaption> </figure>",
  "<p>Yes! I've waited a long time for this, but at last, at long, long last, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/25/anglicanism.catholicism1\">I can be Queen</a>! I shall be beautiful and terrible as the dawn! All shall love me, and despair! </p> <p>For most of my life the only upside to being Catholic (albeit phenomenally lapsed) was the certainty that I wouldn't burn in hell like some ghastly Protestant. Well, that and being allowed to drink wine from the age of seven. </p> <p>But now, now I have the chance, however faint, of joining the royal succession, with all its benefits like \u2026 like \u2026 well ... um \u2026 wearing a shiny hat and having two birthdays \u2026 oh, and I'd get my own telly show. Only once a year, initially, but you've got to start somewhere, and a Christmas special would do. I'd probably make it more fun than just a boring old speech though. More like <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-zxi_Y4Xu8\">Hole in the Wall</a>. I could call it \"The One Show\".</p> <p>Other things one will do when one is Queen will include eating a swan, meeting Helen Mirren and playing practical jokes on royal correspondent and certified pompous oaf James Whitaker. It's going to be brilliant.</p> <p>The downside of course will be hanging out at Boujis, dealing with an even weirder family than I do already, and having to take my own loo seat everywhere (according to my friend Sue whose Dad used to be Dean of Christchurch, Oxford so definitely knows definitely). But I'd cope. It would be my royal duty.</p> <p>That still leaves some things that as, technically, a Catholic, I can't be. A mason, for example, or free of the nagging sense that I'm disappointing someone. But it's a step forward nevertheless.</p> <p>What is this terror of Papism? JFK had to deal with anti-Catholic prejudice in the 1960 election, which I think mostly consisted of Richard Nixon saying, \"He's a Catholic, ya know\", and then making spooky noises during the debates. But then, white, posh, handsome, Harvard-educated man Kennedy triumphed over such discrimination to win. You've got to love an underdog.</p> <p>I suppose the worry is that if the monarch was Catholic, they'd take advice from the Pope, and we couldn't have a German running the country, could we? Oh no, hang on \u2026</p> <p>The argument for abolishing these bits of the Act of Settlement is of course that discriminating on the grounds of religion and gender is not very 21st century. Which is true, but with the whole <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/25/monarchy.constitution1\">choosing-your-head-of-state-based-on-whose-womb-they-happen-to-come-out-of</a> still in place, I can't help feeling it may be missing the bigger picture. </p> <p>And on the other hand, I find it slightly worrying news. For two principal reasons. 1. Tony Blair and 2. Cherie Blair. Tony's probably fancying his chances of weasling in to Windsor Castle now that he's weasled his way into the Roman Church. I don't want to undermine his commitment to the church, but most Catholics feel guilty without any reason to, and he's very much bucking that trend. If I were Gordon Brown, and I wouldn't be, I'd scupper the legislation for that reason alone. Just listen to William Hague's brilliant <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1w1Gu015R0\">description</a> of Blair becoming EU president and think how much worse it would be if Brown had to call him \"your majesty\".</p> <p>Puts a new spin on Ruth Kelly's resignation, doesn't it? And with that desperately creepy thought, I'm off to get myself to get myself a corgi.</p>",

  "<p>World leaders today announced an ambitious plan to end all malaria deaths by 2015, backed by unprecedented funding of nearly $3bn (\u00a31.6bn) from donors including the World Bank and the Gates Foundation.</p> <p>A key part of the strategy is the introduction of a vaccine against the deadly disease, which is now just entering the final stage of trials. Although the vaccine is expected to be only partially effective, it will still save thousands of lives.</p> <p>A donation of $168.7m from Bill Gates ensures that scientists will go on to develop further vaccines in the hope, eventually, of being able to give total immunity to all babies in affected countries soon after birth.</p> <p>The announcement at a UN special summit on the millennium development goals in New York attended by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, together with the presidents of Rwanda and Tanzania, prime minister Gordon Brown and other leaders, sets the bar in the fight against malaria higher than ever before. </p> <p>With tools that are now proven to work, such as long-lasting insecticide-impregnated bed nets, indoor spraying against malarial mosquitoes and new drugs as well as the expected vaccine, it is now hoped not only to bring malaria under control by 2010 but to eliminate deaths.</p> <p>Gordon Brown called the strategy launch \"a real and vital turning point\" which \"brings together a new coalition of forces - government, the private sector and NGOs - to ensure we all rise to the challenge of eradicating malaria deaths by 2015.\" </p> <p>One million people, mainly children under five and pregnant women, die every year of malaria, most of them in Africa. </p> <p>The largest slice of the new money comes from the Global Fund to fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria, which has approved $1.62bn in country grants over two years and then the World Bank, which is putting $1.1bn into Africa over three years. </p> <p>The Bank is focusing especially on Democratic Republic of Congo and Nigeria, where 30-40% of all malaria deaths take place. Group president Robert B Zoellick said that endemic malaria also has serious financial consequences for families. </p> <p>\"Malaria preys on the poor and keeps them poor. Poverty prevents people from buying bed nets to prevent malaria and medicine to cure it,\" he said. </p> <p>\"When people are struck by the disease, parents miss work, children miss school and malaria emergencies plunge families into debt from which they can't recover.\"</p> <p>Bed nets, sprays and artimisinin drugs, derived from the Chinese wormwood plant, have all helped bring malaria rates down in some smaller countries, but a vaccine could have the biggest impact. </p> <p>The one about to enter final trials in 16,000 babies aged 5 to 17 months in a number of countries, seven of them in Africa, is the result of a public/private partnership by GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals with the backing of the PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative (MVI). It has been shown to reduce malaria cases by 30% and halve the numbers of children getting severe malaria.</p> <p>Christian Loucq, director of MVI, said the new vaccine, currently known only as RTS,S, could be available by 2013, if it is swiftly approved by the European licensing authority and then the World Health Organisation, as seems likely. </p> <p>But the new money from the Gates Foundation is a recognition of MVI's plans to engage researchers on the development of an even better vaccine. </p> <p>\"I'm very hopeful that the malaria vaccine currently in advanced testing will be proven effective, but that will just be the first step,\" said Bill Gates. \"Now it's time to develop a new generation of vaccines that are even more effective and could someday eradicate malaria altogether.\"</p>",
  "<p>Nasa's top achievement in Congress this year boils down to a single sentence - one line in a huge spending bill that would allow Nasa to circumvent an arms-control law and purchase Russian-made Soyuz spacecraft.</p> <p>For Nasa administrator Michael Griffin, that might be enough to enable him to retire the space shuttle in 2010 and still get US astronauts to the international space station.</p> <p>Yesterday, the House approved a $630bn measure to fund the government through next year that includes a sentence allowing Nasa to purchase Soyuz until July 2016.</p> <p>For weeks, Griffin has told lawmakers that the Soyuz is the only reliable way to send American astronauts to the space station in the gap between the shuttle's retirement and the planned first mission of its replacement, now set for 2015. But he needed a waiver from the law banning high-tech purchases from Russia because of that country's sale of nuclear materials to Iran.</p> <p>Now it's up to the Senate, where a key panel approved the same waiver on Tuesday. Passage is considered likely because it is attached to the spending bill - \"must-pass\" legislation before Congress adjourns for the year.</p> <p>The tipping point may have come earlier this week when presidential candidate Barack Obama sent a letter to Democratic leaders in Congress urging them to OK the waiver.</p> <p>\"At the end of 2011, Nasa will no longer even have the legal authority to continue paying Russia for Soyuz flights, so unless we act immediately, the US will abandon its role in supporting, and benefiting from, missions to this amazing facility, leaving it to our international partners,\" he wrote.</p> <p>The House action dealt a sharp blow to Representative Dave Weldon, a Florida Republican who fought against the waiver. </p> <p>The retiring lawmaker wants Nasa and Congress to extend the shuttle program - and associated jobs at Kennedy Space Centre - rather than rely on the Russians.<br>\"It's a disappointment,\" said Weldon spokesman Derek Baker. \"We're still pushing for an extension to the shuttle. It's the right thing to do for Florida, national security and the space program.\"</p> <p>But Weldon has been unable to recruit allies, even in central Florida.</p> <p>Representative Tom Feeney, also a Republican from Florida, said he \"reluctantly\" supported the waiver. \"However, the use of the Russian Soyuz should be a last, rather than first, option to providing American astronauts access to the international space station,\" he said.</p> <p>Feeney said he would introduce legislation today that would pump $11bn more into Nasa so that the agency can continue to fly the shuttle through 2012 and accelerate development of its successor.</p> <p>But the measure has little chance of moving in the waning days of this Congress.</p>",
  "<p>Hello from Japan! There are just four races to go in my first season in MotoGP and we have travelled from Indianapolis to Motegi, moving swiftly from five hours behind GMT to eight hours in front. Trying to keep up with the date and time where you are, as well as at home, is actually one of the more challenging aspects of the job - and it is one that the formula one boys will have to deal with in Singapore this weekend.</p> <p>Lewis Hamilton has said he will eat dinner at 1am and go to bed at 3am to prepare his body ahead of the race on Sunday night. It reminds me of my first race this season, in Qatar, which started at 10pm. I adopted a rigorous training regime just to ensure my body was ready to race at that time of day, which I did by keeping very active until about one in the morning. I went out early to acclimatise and for about 10 days straight I found myself in the hotel gym at midnight with just the cleaner for company. I don't know what she thought of me, but I could tell from the looks she was giving me that she might have suspected I was a bit of a nutter.</p> <p>Keeping active is an integral part of acclimatising, and I've found myself exploring Japanese shopping malls at the time of day when my body has been telling me that it's ready for bed.</p> <p>The grand prix is also under floodlights for the first time, and having experienced it myself in Qatar I have to say that they are in for a fantastic time. One of the surprising by-products of racing under lights is that you can see into the driver's helmet as most prefer to wear clear visors to minimise any glare. So whereas everyone may look very calm under normal conditions maybe you will get to see some angry or scared faces in there.</p> <p>As for myself, I've been recovering from what was a poor race last time out at Indianapolis. I finished 18th and, to be honest, it was all my own fault. I simply chose the wrong tyre, banking on the fact that there would be rain during the race as the remnants of Hurricane Ike were sweeping through the area. It didn't happen, though, and your tyres wear away unbelievably quickly in that situation, which just ends up shooting you backwards down the field.</p> <p>Onwards and upwards, though, and I have to say I'm glad that Japan will be the last race where I'm learning the track from scratch. It's draining having to concentrate on that before every race, but I know the last three tracks well and I'm hoping for some really good results before the MotoGP season draws to a close and the circus goes into hibernation over the winter.</p> <p>I still find that I have to pinch myself when I realise that this is what I do for a living. There has never been any history of bike-loving in my family, and I owe my participation in this great sport to my step-dad Ken. When he met my mum he was really into his bikes and used to take me for rides on the back of his machine \u2013 much to my enjoyment, needless to say. I loved it, and when I was nine he got me my first bike, a TY80 Yamaha. Never in a million years would I have dreamt I would end up racing a Yamaha for a living.</p> <p>Getting that bike was a big step for me, and you have no idea how much my standing went up at school when everyone found out I'd got a bike for Christmas rather than a normal present. In terms of my reputation among my peers I don't think I could have done anything cooler.</p> <p>Ken is sadly no longer with us, but I can't forget the influence he had on me. He started taking me to race meetings when I was 10 as my mum wouldn't go - she was far too scared by the danger and what it would do to her little boy, not that I can blame her. She knew how much I loved it so she wouldn't stand it my way, and to be fair it kept me out of trouble a lot of the time. If you're heading off to race meetings every weekend then you don't have nearly as much time to misbehave or get into the normal scrapes that you'd expect a young lad to find himself in.</p> <p>So looking back I guess it served two purposes - it kept me out of trouble, and it gave me something to focus on. I owe Ken more than I really know, but I certainly wouldn't be here, racing motorbikes around the world, if it wasn't for him. I'll definitely be thinking of him when that first podium or that first MotoGP win does come along. And who's to say that might not be this weekend?</p>",
  "<p>Actor Sir Ian McKellen, best known for his role in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, has \"knighted\" a pair of children with Gandalf's sword as part of his work with equality charity Stonewall.</p> <p>McKellen is visiting schools around the UK as part of Stonewall's Education Champion Programme, which aims to address homophobia in schools by sending out representatives who can give advice and guidance to staff and students.</p> <p>Sir Ian told Attitude magazine: \"I've been to talk at quite a few schools recently.</p> <p>\"It is essential to talk to 12- and 13-year-olds because they absorb what's thrown at them, whether it be homophobia or tolerance, and we have to make sure it's the positive stuff.\"</p> <p>At a co-ed faith school in Harpenden, Hertfordshire, McKellen 'knighted' a pair of children Sir Minority and Dame Minority. \"It went very well,\" he said.</p> <p>The actor volunteered to help the programme when it launched at the start of this year.</p> <p>He first became involved with Stonewall in 1988, when the charity was formed in response to the government's controversial section 28 legislation, which forbade the \"promotion\" of homosexuality at school by teaching.</p> <p>Gary Nunn, spokesman for Stonewall, said that McKellan had been well received by youngsters as a \"positive role model\" for homosexuality.</p> <p>Several other celebrities including comedian Alan Carr and Dannii Minogue have been involved in Stonewall's wider Education for All campaign.</p> <p>Stonewall has signed up a five local authorities in Birmingham, Wigan and London to the scheme, with a focus on \"undoing all the harm of section 28 over the past 20 years.\"</p> <p>According to recent research commissioned by the charity, 30% of lesbian and gay pupils say that adults, namely teachers or support staff, are responsible for homophobic incidents in their school. </p> <p>The survey of 1,145 young people also highlights the consequences of bullying for gay pupils. Seven out of ten of those who have experienced it say it has adversely affected their schoolwork. Half of those bullied say they have missed school as a result.</p> <p>\"These deeply disturbing figures should serve as a wake-up call to everyone working in education,\" said Ben Summerskill, Stonewall chief executive. </p> <p>\"This remains one of the few sorts of bullying about which too many schools still take no action. It blights the lives not just of gay children but of thousands of pupils perceived to be lesbian or gay too.\"</p> <p>He added that local authorities have a \"critical role to play\" in ensuring that all schools in their area are equipped to tackle homophobic bullying.</p>",
  "<p>Too few of China's top political posts are held by women, despite them playing an active role at the local level, according to a senior Chinese official.</p> <p>Huang Qingyi, the vice-president of the All-China Women's Federation, said women were better represented than at any point in the country's history, but warned that their numbers still fell far short of male counterparts and that gender inequality persisted.</p> <p>\"There needs to be more female leaders in more senior positions in China,\" she told a press conference ahead of next month's tenth National Women's Congress. \"And that includes the very highest leadership.\"</p> <p>Currently, there are only eight women among the dozens of decision-makers at the national level in China, she said. Women accounted for just 21% of deputies at the National People's Congress this year, and 18% of members at the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.</p> <p>Yet, at the local level, women account for more than 48% of the members of urban residents' committees, and about 23% of villagers' committees, she said.</p> <p>\"It is not because there is a lack of good female cadres, it is just hard for them to reach the senior level,\" agreed Professor Lu Ying, of the Sun<br>Yat-Sen University school of law. She pointed to the relative glut of senior women leaders in Hong Kong and Taiwan.</p> <p>Male cadres often had more respect for other men and were more likely to help them onto the next rung of the party ladder, said Lu. Valuable changes were taking place, but the reform and opening-up process had halted some of the early advances made under Communist rule.</p> <p>\"In the 50s, after the liberation, there was the gender equality marriage law, and 20 to 30% of the base level leaders were women. But economic reform and development has forced the cultivation of 'golden eagles' [the elite] - but not women. It becomes detached from ordinary people, and civil society, and it will not help cultivate women [leaders],\" she said.</p> <p>Lu cited Wu Yi - China's internationally respected \"iron lady\", who retired as vice premier this year - as a good example of someone who had the ability to be premier but lacked the opportunity. Wu was renowned for her tough negotiating style and was lauded for the way she tackled the Sars cover-up.</p>",
  "<p>Colorado Democrats accused a Republican county clerk yesterday of falsely informing Colorado College that students from outside the state could not register to vote if their parents claimed them as a dependent on their tax returns.</p> <p>At a news conference in Colorado Springs, Democrats also criticized Robert Balink, the El Paso County clerk and recorder, who was a delegate to the Republican National Convention, for taking other steps they said would dampen voting by college students, who are expected to heavily favor Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama.</p> <p>\"When election officials spread false information about who is eligible to vote and remove, not add, polling places, we need to be concerned that eligible voters will be denied their right to vote,\" said Pat Waak, the chairwoman of the Colorado Democratic Party.</p> <p>Balink issued a statement saying his office had misinterpreted state law and \"mistakenly published information that was incorrect\".</p> <p>Balink's actions are the latest of several instances in which local election officials, including some in Virginia and South Carolina, have discouraged college students from voting in a year in which legions of students have thrown their energy behind Obama.</p> <p>Discovery of these restrictions comes as Democrats have increasingly accused Republicans of using an array of tactics to suppress the Democratic voter turnout in the November election.</p> <p>Liz Olson, the elections manager in Colorado's El Paso County, said that the office \"takes full responsibility for what's in that document. Nobody told us to put anything in there\".</p> <p>Martha Tierney, an attorney for the Colorado Democratic Party, said she obtained emails showing that Balink's office sent a misleading flier to the Colorado College president's office to provide students with voter-registration information and urged its circulation on campus.</p> <p>The flier stated: \"What this means is that if your parents still claim you on their income tax returns, and they file that return in a state other than Colorado, you are not eligible to register to vote or vote in Colorado.\"</p> <p>Voter residency requirements vary from state to state, but must meet the guarantees of the US Constitution, said Jon Greenbaum, a voting rights expert with the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. Greenbaum said that what states and counties can't do is adopt rules that treat one group of voters differently than others.</p> <p>Greenbaum noted that Virginia's elections board recently revised language on its website that discouraged students from registering after reports of a similar episode at Virginia Tech, in Blacksburg, Virginia. The New York Times reported on September 8 that a local registrar had issued two releases that incorrectly suggested dire consequences for the university's students who registered to vote there, including the possibility they no longer could be claimed as dependents on their parents' tax returns.</p> <p>Sujatha Jahagirdar, the program director of the Student Public Interest Research Group's New Voters Project in Washington, said she encountered similar problems when she posed as a college freshman last week and called registrar's offices in Greenville County, South Carolina, home to Furman University, and York County, South Carolina, where Winthrop University is located.</p> <p>Jahagirdar said a Greenville official asked if her parents listed her as a dependent, and when she replied in the affirmative, told her: \"You should vote where your parents live.\" She said a York County representative asked if she was in town for school, and when she said yes, stated flatly: \"You can't vote here.\"</p> <p>A caller yesterday got similar responses.</p> <p>Told of the information imparted by his staff, Conway Belangia, Greenville County's director of registration and elections, said that \"if a staff person made a statement like that, it was an error\".</p> <p>A York County official didn't respond to calls for comment.<br>Belangia said, however, that if a student lives in a dormitory, he must respond to a series of questions laid out in a 1974 federal court order covering voting registration in the county. He said students must demonstrate their \"intent to claim this locale as their home when they finish school\".</p> <p>Jahagirdar called the counties' policies \"intimidating\" and said they \"send a message that young voters are not welcome in our democracy\" just when they're first enjoying the right to vote.</p> <p>The flap over students' voting rights comes after Democrats last week filed a lawsuit in Michigan, seeking a court order barring Republicans from using lists of people facing mortgage foreclosure proceedings as a basis for challenging their voting eligibility. Michigan Republicans denied using foreclosure lists to cast doubt about voters' qualifications.</p> <p>And in Ohio, a pivotal state that was mired in allegations of voting irregularities in the 2004 presidential election, secretary of state Jennifer Brunner yesterday advised county election boards that foreclosure lists should not be considered proof that voters have changed residences.</p> <p>\"Ohioans faced with the pain and turmoil of a home foreclosure should not be targeted by the forces of disenfranchisement on election day,\" Brunner said.</p>",
  "<p>I'm confused about this whole Spore situation. Right now, there are lots of articles like <a href=\"http://blogs.zdnet.com/security/?p=1969\">this one</a> on ZDNet claiming that the backlash against the game's Draconian digital rights management may mean an end to the whole concept of DRM. If you've not kept up to date on all this, the game uses a pimped version of the SecuROM system, and among other 'features' limits the number of computers a purchaser can install the game on (originally to three, now five). It initially also required regular online validation, although EA later <a href=\"http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/52618\">conceded to public pressure</a> and amended the requirements, so that validation is only needed when downloading updates.</p> <p>The backlash has indeed been messy. There have been a lot of protest ratings on Amazon - seemingly the gamer's positive action of choice these days. There's also been a <a href=\"http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/54887\">class action lawsuit</a>, targeting EA's non-disclosure of the SecuROM installation. And more ironically, there have been a heck of a lot of illegal downloads - over 500,000 according to a <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/14/AR2008091400885.html\">recent piece in the Washington Post</a>, which may make it the most pirated game ever. So it would seem EA has lost on every front.<br><br>Except it hasn't. The publisher announced yesterday that it has sold over a million copies since the game's launch. Okay, that's not up there with GTA IV, but then Spore is a game about evolution and the nature of existence rather than about shooting people and running over hookers. There's been lots of bad PR, but it has mostly been contained within the hardcore fraternity. To most people invasive DRM is no different to the hundreds of other pop-ups and warning windows that arrive uninvited on their PC desktops every day, demanding updates, registrations, installations and passwords. Just another barrier to click through in order to get to the software itself. And of course, the whole music download industry has already turned us into zombie consumer cattle, slavishly accepting bizarre re-use restrictions on our MP3s. Wait a minute did I say <em>our</em> MP3s? Christ, what a naive Luddite. Ownership is so over.</p> <p>DRM is our fault, of course. We accept invasive registration and installation requirements, we have accepted the restrictive downloads foisted on us by music download sites, and, yep, we do love bittorrent. Regardless of the Spore, Mass Effect and Bioshock controversies, game publishers will probably take the PR hit because it doesn't affect the mainstream user - the one all the expensive ads are targeted at. Of course, the 500,000 illegal downloads might do more damage, but then will EA think 's**t everyone hates DRM, let's scrap it', or 's**t, our DRM's not good enough, let's make it tougher'? </p>",

  "<p>The former England manager Terry Venables will decide today whether to become interim manager of Newcastle United after holding talks yesterday about taking over at the beleaguered club. Venables is the latest name in the frame to take over since the departure of Kevin Keegan and the owner Mike Ashley's decision to put the club up for sale. </p> <p>\"I can confirm I met Newcastle representatives,\" Venables told The Sun. \"Those talks will continue in the morning [today] when, hopefully, I can give them a final decision.\"</p> <p>Venables is understood to have held talks with the Newcastle vice-president Tony Jimenez, the managing director Derek Llambias and the executive director Dennis Wise in London with a view to persuade the 65-year-old to take over control of first team affairs from Chris Hughton. Venables previously held talks with Newcastle in September 2004 when he was in discussion with the then chairman Freddy Shepherd to succeed the sacked Sir Bobby Robson, but the job eventually went to Graeme Souness.</p> <p>Should Venables reject the opportunity to return to the game, it is understood there is an alternative candidate with David O'Leary, Alan Curbishley, Kenny Dalglish and Glenn Hoddle also linked with the role.

  "<p>Three Chinese astronauts today blasted off on a mission to carry out the country's first spacewalk.</p> <p>Shengzhou 7 launched from the site in Jiuquan, north-west China, just after 9.10pm (2.10pm BST).</p> <p>Shortly after the launch the astronauts told the Beijing control centre they felt \"physically sound\".</p> <p>Depending on how well the astronauts acclimatise to weightlessness and the other physical demands of their environment, the spacewalk, which will only involve one of the astronauts actually leaving the orbit module, should take place on Friday or Saturday. They will then return to Earth.</p> <p>China's president, Hu Jintao, who watched the take-off from the launch centre, earlier told the astronauts: \"I believe you will have complete success in this glorious and sacred mission. The motherland and people are waiting for your triumphant return.\"</p> <p>The mission is China's third manned space venture since October 2003 when it joined Russia and the US as the only countries to have sent astronauts into orbit.</p> <p>A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, Liu Jianchao, emphasised today that the country's aspirations were simply to \"explore and make peaceful use of outer space\".</p> <p>Other nations are less sure, especially after China used a ballistic missile to shoot down one of its own defunct satellites in January this year. A few months later, a senior US general argued that Beijing was \"aggressively\" developing space weaponry technology.</p> <p>Today, Kevin Pollpeter, an expert on China's space programme from the Defence Group Inc in Washington DC, described the mission as \"a very outward show of Chinese power\".</p> <p>\"The eventual goal is to build a space station. For them, that's become one of the trappings of being a great power,\" he told Reuters.</p> <p>The three astronauts are Zhai Zhigang, Liu Boming and Jing Haipeng, all aged 42. Two of them will don spacesuits for the spacewalk, although the pair who will enter the orbit module have yet to be named.</p> <p>Their task will be to take samples for tests. The crew will also release a small monitoring satellite and trial another satellite during the mission.</p> <p>China has developed its own EVA (extra-vehicular activity) spacesuit, which cost 30 million yuan (\u00a32.37m), described by Hu as \"a great leap for China's space technology\".</p> <p>One astronaut taking part in the spacewalk will wear the Chinese Feitian suit while the other will wear a Russian suit.

If the party breaches the regulations again, it will now face criminal prosecution and an unlimited fine. </p> <p>The Lib Dems were accused of \"utter hypocrisy\" by the Scottish National party and Tories last week, since the party had complained about a very similar cold-calling campaign by the SNP in 2005 and demanded stricter legal controls on automated calls.</p> <p>The Lib Dems said they accepted the decision, and would not contest it.</p> <p>\"The Liberal Democrats will abide by the ruling from the information commissioner's office. We will not be appealing against the decision,\"<br>a spokesman said.</p> <p>Last week, Clegg had denied the calls would anger people trying to put children to bed or watch evening television. </p> <p>\"I rather hope it won't disturb. People don't have to pick up the phone if they don't like the time at which the call is made,\" he said last week.</p> <p>\"It's a great way, it seems to me, to first say publicly what we believe in and then get immediate feedback.\" However, the ICO said 26 members of the public complained about the calls. </p> <p>David Smith, the deputy information commissioner, said his office \"has consistently made clear that the promotion of a political party counts as marketing. We have previously issued detailed guidance to all major political parties on this subject. </p> <p>\"Many people find unsolicited automated calls particularly intrusive and annoying so it is important that any organisation making such calls ensures that individuals have given their consent before they are targeted.\" </p> <p>The SNP's MSP for Central Fife, Tricia Marwick, welcomed the commissioner's ruling but said his officials should have blocked the cold-calling campaign before it took place. </p> <p>The SNP's chief executive, Peter Murrell, wrote to Thomas's office to complain 12 hours before the calls were made. Thomas's officials had confirmed they contacted the Lib Dems on Wednesday morning about the proposed calls.</p> <p>\"It is disappointing that the commissioner did not act to stop the calls being made and the law being broken in the first place,\" she said. \"What point is there to an enforcement notice when the calls have already been made? I will be raising questions with the commissioner over this delay in acting.\"</p> <p>Marwick added: \"It has been clear since 2005 that this type of automated calling is prohibited. The hypocrisy of the Lib Dems in making these calls knows no bounds.</p> <p>\"Having reported other parties for making similar calls and having run a campaign against unwanted telesales calls themselves the Lib Dems were well aware of their actions.\"</p>",
  "<p>An opening jump on Wall Street has breathed a little life into the London market.</p> <p>With no news yet on the $700bn (\u00a3380bn) bank bail-out, US investors are nonetheless betting that the plan will receive the necessary approval from Congress. So the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up more than 130 points, which has helped lift the previously moribund <strong>FTSE 100</strong> by 39.7 points to 5135.3.</p> <p>Where we go from here if the plan is agreed is another matter, but it is probably a better place than if it collapses.</p> <p>Insurers - now a protected species of course, at least from-short sellers - are leading the way in the UK, with <strong>RSA Insurance</strong> up 12% to 160.7p.

  "<p>Any believer in religious tolerance and basic equality between the sexes<br>should surely cheer the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/25/anglicanism.catholicism1\">news</a> that the government is to overturn the 300-year-old rules which bar Catholics from succeeding to the throne, along with the primogeniture principle which automatically passes the crown to a male child, over the head of a sister born before him.</p> <p>As a Guardian writer, I should be especially chuffed \u2013 since it was this newspaper that raised the issue, launching a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/25/constitution.monarchy\">campaign</a> for a change in the Act of Settlement some eight years ago.</p> <p>And yet, I can't get too excited. First, Labour reportedly sees this as a task for a fourth term \u2013 a fourth term that might never come. </p> <p>Second, who have been the victims of this terribly unjust law? We read that, \"In recent years the Earl of St Andrews and Prince Michael of Kent lost the right of succession through marriage to Catholics.\" Now, I hope I'm a generous soul, but of all the many victims of human rights abuses in the world, somehow the Earl and the Prince don't strike me as those most in need of urgent help.</p> <p>Yes, of course it's appalling that such unvarnished religious bigotry, directed not only at Catholics, incidentally, but all non-Protestant faiths, should be enshrined and made sacred in the law of our land, just as it's wrong that such an overt example of gender discrimination \u2013 favouring the younger son over the older daughter \u2013 should be on the statute book.</p> <p>But we should not delude ourselves. Scrapping these rules will not make our constitution any fairer. It's not as if it will suddenly allow any Catholic or Muslim or Hindu or Jew or atheist to become our head of state. Of course it won't. Because our current rules don't just discriminate against Catholics or women. They discriminate against the entire British population bar a single family: the house of Windsor.</p> <p>Under our monarchical system, only members of that one clan are allowed to serve as our national figurehead. It discriminates against every single one of us who does not share the Windsor DNA, anybody who does not have the right blood in their veins.</p> <p>So, sure, it's good that this symbolic insult to Catholics is tidied away. But let's not pretend that our constitution \u2013 so long as it determines our<br>head of state by inheritance, not election \u2014 does not still insult everyone else in Britain, telling us that, from our very birth, we are not good enough to represent our nation to ourselves and to the world.</p>",

  "<p>Music forms the bulk of many a radio station's output; it defines their character and values, and is regulated to the point of suffocation. We tend to assume that because a radio presenter appears in control on air, they must have some say in the music they play. This is rarely the case.</p> <p>The new kid on the block is going about business differently. Absolute Radio - the national station due to replace Virgin Radio on Monday - is inviting listeners to come to their London studios and sit in on their weekly playlist meetings, where staff and presenters discuss what music should be played.</p> <p>The Absolute Radio chief operating officer, Clive Dickens, explains: \"Playlist meetings have always had a sheath of mystery around them ... our listeners are key to building the Absolute brand and knowing what they think about the music has always been one of our major objectives.\" </p> <p>Music testing by radio stations is the reason so many of the same songs are heard on different stations; asking hundreds of people their opinion establishes a middle-ground, where the peaks and troughs of individual taste are smoothed out. </p> <p>Somebody once hit the nail on the donkey by describing music testing as \"the equivalent of filling Wembley stadium with people, asking what their favourite food is, and then feeding them fish and chips for every meal\".</p> <p>In some radio stations the group programmer has the final decision on the new music. Weekly music testing still guides the decisions, but then another factor comes into play: record pluggers.</p> <p>The conduit between the music and radio industries, pluggers aim to ensure their label's releases receive airplay. </p> <p>Their job is the stuff that adages about mutual back-scratching were made for. The plugger has the content - the music, the interviews, the competition prizes, the exclusives. Radio has the audience, capable of lighting an artist's fuse and sending their career sky-rocketing.</p> <p>The net result is that deals are done to ensure everyone gets what they want. A group of stations may add a new artist to their playlist in return for an exclusive competition for listeners to meet a more famous artist. How many times the song is played may depend on what the station gets in return.</p> <p>And so the playlist meetings begin weaving their tangled web. Immediately, the justification for spending tens of thousands of pounds on music testing becomes null and void. Even if the song is disliked by listeners, it'll still be played several times a day.</p> <p>Then there's the matter of those stations who approach advertisers to sponsor artist appearances and competitions. Suddenly you're <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2006/nov/09/charlottechristie\">not a million miles away from payola</a>; radio stations play particular songs in return for events that generate revenue for the station.</p> <p>So how involved will Absolute Radio's listeners be in choosing the music? The decision to open up playlist meetings to the public has more than a whiff of gimmickry to it and ultimately it'll be staff that have the final say, not the great unwashed. </p> <p>But having met Clive Dickens, I know he's passionate in his belief that radio in this country can and should be done better, more so than any of the industry's other figureheads. </p> <p>Dickens wouldn't waste time trying something if he thought no good would come of it. Maybe Absolute Radio will sing a different song to the rest of the industry.</p>",
  "<p>John Travolta is the latest Hollywood A-lister to be seduced by Europacorp, the French company set up by Fifth Element director Luc Besson to churn out high octane action movies. He will appear in the thriller From Paris With Love which is shooting in a suburb of the French capital.</p> <p>Travolta plays an American secret agent who crosses path with a young embassy worker - to be played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers - while on a high-risk mission in the French capital, Variety <a href=\"http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117992789.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1\">reports</a>.</p> <p>Besson's firm has graduated in recent years from using actors such as Jason Statham (on the Transporter series) to bigger names. Most recently it produced the Liam Neeson revenge thriller Taken, about an ex special-ops agent who turns Paris upside down in his efforts to save his kidnapped daughter from being sold as a sex slave by evil Algerians. Pierre Morel, who directed that film, which hits UK cinemas tomorrow, will also take charge of From Paris With Love.</p> <p>It's all a long way from Besson's own The Fifth Element, his sprawling, supremely ambitious 1997 sci-fi epic starring Bruce Willis in stereotypical save-the-world mode. But the Frenchman said two years ago that he no longer wanted to direct, preferring to devote himself to civic projects instead.</p> <p>\"I want to take a little care of my fellow citizens,\" he said at the time. \"I want to take a little care of my planet. I want to act in favor of the inner cities, in favour of the environment. I want to do lots of things.\"</p> <p>One of those things, on current form, seems to be producing old-school balls-out action films set in France but starring Hollywood A-listers. Expect plenty more from Europacorp in the years to come.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> Manchester. <br> <strong>The lineup:</strong> Daniel Land (vocals, guitar), Graeme Meikle (guitar), Oisin Scarlett (guitar), Andrew Galpin (bass), Marcus Mayes (drums), Jason Magee (percussion).<br> <strong>The background:</strong> Barely 24 hours after announcing that this column was Going Metal following yesterday's excellent To the Bones hard rock band, we've found something we like almost as much, also from Manchester, but from the opposite end of the musical spectrum. Daniel Land &amp; the Modern Painters make music that is slow and stately, soporific and somnolent, like a sonic cathedral moving majestically through the icy fj\u00f6rds of the frozen north, or something. Yes, folks, we're in shoegazing territory, with a six-piece band signed to Sonic Cathedral, the label that celebrates itself and the early-90s era of effects pedals and gorgeously gauzy noise. If you used to genuflect before those groups that emerged in the slipstream of My Bloody Valentine like Slowdive and Chapterhouse, if you still keep a keen eye on developments in the area of echoey reverb-drenched experimental rock and artists such as Fennesz and Ulrich Schnauss - the latter, incidentally, recently reworked several DL&amp;TMP tracks - then you might feel like immersing yourself in this hazy, shimmering sound. <br> Daniel Land is gay. This may or may not be relevant. He frequents the clubs and bars of Manchester's notorious Canal Street but don't expect hi-NRG sex-disco from this character. Like Neil Halstead, who left Slowdive to form the country-rock outfit Mojave 3 and whom DL&amp;TMP are currently supporting on tour, he does, however, acknowledge the connection and join the dots between Cocteau Twins and country music, and you can imagine his songs being stripped down to become minimal, fuss-free, heartfelt laments. He's even written a country song, \"a musically simple but emotionally complex song about my boyfriend\" which he describes as \"probably the only country song written specifically about gay sex\". He loves three-minute pop and endless, abstract noise. \"There's a real softie in me that just wants to write the perfect pop song,\" he says, \"but it keeps coming out blurry and vague.\" </p> <p>Born in Devon but a student in Manchester, Land is a sensitive soul and, shall we say, not your typical Manc lad. His songs name-check the painter Chagall and the proto-feminist writer Virginia Woolf, and he cites as influences \"rainy Saturday mornings, Scott Walker, the paintings of Mark Rothko, driving around Exmoor with my father, the novels of Milan Kundera and Edmund White, Jane Siberry, winter walks on deserted beaches, comfortable silences and glamorous one-night-stands\". Although it's never going to win any awards on The X Factor, his voice is a subtly powerful instrument, an androgynous device of no fixed sex that merges with the four-guitar wall of noise only to occasionally soar across the ecclesiastically solemn soundscapes like the spawn of Liz Fraser and Antony Hegarty in space. This is the sort of thing Daniel Land &amp; the Modern Painters make you write. They should feel deeply ashamed. <br> <strong>The buzz:</strong> \"A magnificent, magical and monolithic slice of shoegaze beauty. Sounds like Slowdive reimagined by Phil Spector.\"</p> <p><strong>The truth:</strong> Slowdive were, we can now admit, the best of the post-MBV shoegazers, and if you like the idea of their songs like Morningrise and She Calls being sung by a choirboy, then you'll love this lot. <br> <strong>Most likely to:</strong> Float across a field of alabaster with your first heart-throb under your cloak. <br> <strong>Least likely to:</strong> Go slowly walking down the hall, faster than a cannonball. <br> <strong>What to buy:</strong> Within the Boundaries b/w Benjamin's Room is released by Sonic Cathedral on October 27. <br> <strong>File next to:</strong> Slowdive, Ride, Chapterhouse, Boo Radleys. <br> <strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/danielland\">www.myspace.com/danielland</a></p> <p><strong>Tomorrow's new band:</strong> Amazing Baby. </p>",
  "<p><strong>Goal one: Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger</strong></p> <p><strong>Aim:</strong> To halve the proportion of people living on less than a $1 a day, and to halve the proportion of people suffering from hunger, to achieve full and productive employment and ensure everyone has access to decent work, including women and young people.<br><strong>Progress:</strong> The UN is optimistic that halving the proportion of people living on less than a $1 a day can be achieved by 2015, although this is largely fuelled by the huge strides being made in Asia. Little progress has been made in reducing extreme poverty in sub-Saharan Africa. The latest estimates by the World Bank put the number of people living in extreme poverty in the developing world higher than previously thought, due to the new threshold to measure extreme poverty rising from $1 to $1.25 to account for purchasing power parity.</p> <p>The proportion of people suffering from malnutrition and hunger has fallen since the early 1990s, but rising food prices are having an adverse effect on the poor and the number of people without access to food is rising.</p> <p>Although many people now employed, wages are too low to lever them out of poverty. Microfinance initiatives have, however, made a significant impact. Agricultural programmes to improve food production, particularly rice in sub-Saharan Africa, have also proved successful.</p> <p><strong>Goal Two: to achieve universal primary education</strong></p> <p><strong>Aim:</strong> To ensure that all children, boys and girls, complete primary school<br><strong>Progress:</strong> The number of children of primary school age out of education has fallen from 103 million in 1999 to 73 million in 2006, which means some 570 million children are enrolled in school. In southern Asia enrolment rates stand at more than 90%, while in sub-Saharan Africa the figure has reached 71%. Girls, however, are still disproportionately out of school, as are those children from poorer households and living in rural areas. Some 58 countries are on track to miss the 2015 target. Despite an increase in aid for education, from $1.6bn in 1999 to $5bn in 2006, it is estimated that $11bn is needed annually to achieve this goal.</p> <p><strong>Goal three: to promote gender equality and empower women</strong></p> <p><strong>Aim:</strong> To eliminate gender disparity in primary and secondary education<br><strong>Progress:</strong> Despite missing the 2005 interim target for this goal, two out of three countries have achieved gender parity at primary school, with girls primary enrolment increasing more than boys in developing countries between 2001 and 2006. However, the slow progress being made in some areas, including sub-Saharan African and western Asia, means, at the current rate, this target is still unlikely to be achieved. Lack of good private sanitation at schools remains a barrier to girls attending.</p> <p>Women now have more income-earning opportunities, occupying almost 40% of all paid jobs outside agriculture, compared to 35% in 1990. But the majority of women work in what are considered \"vulnerable jobs\", in which they are self-employed or unpaid family workers.</p> <p>Over the past eight years, more women have gained parliamentary seats, but high positions in government remain elusive for most.</p> <p>The UN states that violence against women is an obstacle to meeting this target. Some developing countries have introduced laws against rape and domestic violence, but the implementation of them is often patchy.</p> <p><strong>Goal four: To reduce child mortality</strong></p> <p><strong>Aim:</strong> To reduce mortality rates for children under five by two thirds<br><strong>Progress:</strong> Over the past 40 years, child mortality rates have dropped, but millions of children still die each year from preventable illnesses. At the current rate, reducing the mortality rate of children under five by two thirds won't be met in 62 countries. According to the UN in 27 countries the rates have remained static or have got worse. Lack of decent healthcare, malnutrition and poor sanitation are partly to blame. Despite targeted aid for maternal, newborn and child healthcare increasing from $2.1bn in 2003 to $3.5bn in 2006, more money is needed to achieve the goal.</p> <p><strong>Goal five: improve maternal health</strong></p> <p><strong>Aim:</strong> To reduce by three quarters the number of women who die during pregnancy or in childbirth. <br><strong>Progress:</strong> Three years ago, estimates showed that every minute a woman died of complications related to pregnancy and childbirth, almost all live in developing countries. Achieving this goal remains a huge task and experts believe that an extra $5-6bn needs to be channelled into this area to meet the target.</p> <p><strong>Goal six: combat HIV/Aids, malaria and other diseases</strong></p> <p><strong>Aim:</strong> To provide universal access to treatment for HIV and Aids, and to halt and reverse the spread, to halt and reverse the spread of malaria and other major diseases<br><strong>Progress:</strong> Some progress has been made to control the spread of malaria, through the distribution of bed nets and availability of drugs, but the disease still kills at least 1 million people a year, most in sub-Saharan African. More money will be needed to provide anti-malaria nets across the whole of Africa. Incidences of TB are expected to be halted and to decline before the 2015 deadline.</p> <p>However, achieving universal access to treatment for HIV and Aids by 2010 and halting and reversing the spread of the disease by 2015 are proving particularly difficult, with most countries not on track to meet the targets.

  "<p>The government's plans to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/25/anglicanism.catholicism1\">update the monarchy</a> are welcome so far as they go, but they do not go very far. Removing the sex and religious discrimination embedded in the British constitution \u2013 the 1701 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/25/anglicanism.catholicism2\">Act of Settlement</a> \u2013 is long overdue. But the anomaly remains: why should an important public office, that of head of state, be filled, not on merit or by public election, but exclusively by the descendants of a 17th-century German princess?</p> <p>Under the British constitution, it is the Act of Settlement which determines upon whom the crown shall descend. It reads today as a blood curdling anti-catholic diatribe, providing that any monarch who holds communion with the Church of Rome or marries a papist shall be unthroned immediately. It creates for the UK a white Anglo-German protestant head of state \u2013 descending from the body of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophia_of_Hanover\">Princess Sophia of Hanover</a> according to the feudal principle of primogeniture, which requires inheritance down the male line. This is in blatant contravention of the Sex Discrimination Act whilst the requirement that the monarch be an Anglican amounts to discrimination on grounds of religion and is contrary to the Human Rights Act. Why would Charles be unfit to be king if he became a Methodist, or a Hindu or Muslim or Rastarfarian? It is wholly unacceptable to have this primitive bigotry embodied in the rules for choosing a head of state. The laws which define and protect the royal family breach at least four articles of the European convention on human rights. They are obsolete and obnoxious. </p> <p>There are many other laws relating to the royal family, most of which are merely silly (although the monarch's immunity from any legal action may not be amusing if you are run over by a royal motorcade): I do not really object to the law which vests property in every wild white swan in the realm in the Queen, nor to the fact that every whale, sturgeon or grampus landed in the kingdom belongs to her. Actually, the law states that the heads of what it terms \"the royal fish\" should belong to the King and their tails to the Queen. On vital matters like these, our constitution is very explicit.</p> <p>It is much less clear about trifling details such as which party gets to form the government in a hung parliament. But there you go. If you don't write down your rules, they will be invented or manipulated by those in power at the time. We have an Alice-in-Wonderland constitution which means what the prime minister wants it to mean.</p> <p>Instead of a written constitution, we have a patchwork quilt of ancient and outdated laws, supplemented by the conventions and traditions made up as we merrily and royally roll along. As a result we have no independent head of state. The monarch now accepts the advice \u2013 that's a euphemism for obeying the directions \u2013 of the government of the day. We lack an elected and respected figurehead, whose wisdom and integrity can provide moral leadership and independent political judgment in times of crisis. One inevitable result of choosing a head of state by inheritance rather than election is that in a crisis they may lack the confidence, popularity and independence needed to make any worthwhile contribution to the governance of Britain.</p> <p>That is a pity, if only because the concept of an independent elected head of state is useful in a modern constitution, as one check on the power of a government which has no other checks and balances, other than a judiciary to keep it straight at the edges and a press to yap at its more obvious blunders. It has no supreme court to pull it up short for violating the guarantees made to its citizens by a bill of rights.</p> <p>The head of state should be someone who embodies the outlook that most people want to see projected onto the world stage as representative of their nation: a figure available to serve as leader in cases of government crisis or collapse. Good luck apart, the British monarchy will not provide \u2013 by sexist, racist or religiously discriminatory descent \u2013 the calibre of leadership that can be provided by elections every seven years for head of state.</p> <p>The head of state is an important public office. Its occupant must be consulted by the prime minister and is required to advise and to warn the government of the day. In an emergency, the head of state's political savvy and street wisdom might prove crucial: in <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article653956.ece\">Trinidad in 1990</a>, for example, the president had to run the country for a week and deal with a crisis when the prime minister and cabinet were held as hostages in parliament by Islamic terrorists. Australians will never forget the historic misjudgement of their governor-general (and de facto head of state) in 1975, when in the name of the Queen he sacked the <a href=\"http://whitlamdismissal.com/\">Whitlam government</a>. What would the Queen do in such circumstances in Britain, or if an election resulted in a deadlock? It is demeaning to democracy to have this office filled by descent from one massively wealthy upper class family, and not by merit (eg a head of state elected by parliament) or preferably, elected by the people. It is also dangerous: no one could seriously expect the Queen herself to handle the sort of emergency that occurred in Trinidad.</p> <p>Tom Paine pointed out that a hereditary head of state was as ridiculous as a hereditary poet or a hereditary mathematician. He overlooked the entertainment potential in a hereditary royal family \u2013 one reason why every tabloid will fight to preserve ours. No government could envisage their abolition, at least in the Queen's lifetime, although the constitution could be rewritten to give the monarchy only a very small part of it. They could run castles, hold royal garden parties at Buckingham Palace, take overseas trips to maintain Commonwealth ties, and boost the trade in whisky, jam and boot polish that comes \"by royal appointment.\" The monarchy could, in other words, be stripped of its political status whilst retaining its symbolic position. The head of state would be a president, elected every seven years to advise the government, inspire the people and open (and if necessarily close) the parliament.</p> <p>If the monarchy is to have a fighting chance of playing a useful part in the governments of 21st century Britain, it will permit itself to be stripped of the Act of Settlement's sex and religious discrimination, and accept a secular and minimal role as custodians of its own history, a role which should be clearly defined in a written constitution.</p>",
  "<p>Firearms officers should have been waiting outside Jean Charles de Menezes' south London home to intercept possible terror suspects on the morning he was shot, a senior police officer told an inquest today.</p> <p>John McDowall, the Metropolitan police's deputy assistant commissioner, said he had wanted undercover C019 firearms officers in place as quickly as possible. It was their responsibility to stop anyone suspected of involvement in the failed July 21 suicide bombings if they left the block of flats where De Menezes lived in Scotia Road. </p> <p>The failure of firearms officers to head off the Brazilian electrician before he entered Stockwell tube station is expected to be one of the key issues of the 12-week inquest into his fatal shooting. </p> <p>Nicholas Hilliard QC, for the inquest, questioned McDowall on the tactical decisions he made as he coordinated the police manhunt in the early hours of July 22 2005. </p> <p>He said: \"Two hours or so after you had set the strategy at 7am you would have expected that firearms officers, a team, would have been there or in the vicinity, at least after two hours?\"</p> <p>McDowall replied: \"I would. As I have said I think I had asked for a firearms team, specialist firearms officers, to be deployed as quickly as possible. The exact time of when they would get there I was not clear about, but then I was not aware of the decisions that had been made about which teams to use and so on.\" </p> <p>McDowall admitted that only four of a possible six firearms teams were available because of annual leave and said officers were also needed at a second suspect address in north London.</p> <p>Under cross-examination by Michael Mansfield QC, who is representing the De Menezes family, McDowall acknowledged the fact that some of the surveillance officers involved did not have a photograph of the terrorist suspect Hussein Osman, and had only seen a passport-sized image on a gym card found in the failed bomber's rucksack. </p> <p>Mansfield accused the police officer of making strategic decisions in a vacuum, failing to ensure his strategy was clearly communicated and omitting to check key information. McDowall's claim that there were no tactical firearms advisers available at Scotland Yard in the early hours of July 22 was \"nonsense\".</p> <p>Mansfield asked: \"What went wrong, so wrong that a totally innocent man is dead?\"</p> <p>McDowall replied: \"It is my belief that there was a mistaken identification and then there was doubt about whether that identification was correct or not. I think that was instrumental in bringing about the tragic outcome that we know of.\"</p> <p>Mansfield said directions from McDowall about what officers watching the Scotia Road flats should do if anyone emerged were not \"clearly communicated\". He accused the assistant commissioner of not investigating whether 21 Scotia Road, where De Menezes lived, was a separate property or otherwise, despite the fact that maps and building plans were readily available.</p> <p>McDowall, he said, did not clearly appoint other more junior officers, leading to \"controversies and confusion, and failed to investigate surveillance pictures taken in Cumbria the previous year, which were later found to include Osman. </p> <p>Mansfield said: \"I am going to suggest to you, as we go through, it is quite a lot that did not occur to you that night. It is quite a lot that did not occur to you that eventually led to the death of this innocent man, do you follow? Has that ever occurred to you that, in fact, there are omissions by you that really, had you followed up - and a large number of things - the whole scenario might have been different?\"</p> <p>McDowall replied: \"I do not accept that. I think that, with benefit of hindsight, one does look back at what one has or has not done and, clearly, I think, there probably are things that I could have done, but for whatever reason, at that time, I did not think of it.\" </p> <p>McDowall admitted there were \"certain aspects\" that could have been done differently in preparing the manhunt strategy. </p> <p>Asked to give an example, he said: \"Well, we have discussed the time it took the firearms team to get to the briefing. Had I known that it was taking that long - I have had an explanation for why that is and I am not sure we could have shaved a huge amount of time off - but that is one of the things I have considered.\"</p>",

  "<p>Well done, ministers! By accident, design or sheer journalistic enterprise they have managed to get Guardian readers sparing some thought for constitutional reform this morning instead of fretting about cabinet splits.</p> <p>What reform exactly? Well, as diligent readers of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/25/anglicanism.catholicism1\">Patrick Wintour's report</a> already know, No 10 is backing a bill that would lift the bar on Catholics inheriting the throne and end the ancient rule of primogeniture which gives male heirs precedent over women.</p> <p>Geoffrey Robertson, the flamboyant Australian QC who has made previous legal challenges to the status quo, calls the plan \u2013 drafted by Chris Bryant MP \u2013 \"two small steps towards a more rational constitution\".</p> <p>I love that word \"rational\" (which of us is entirely so?), and note the adjective \"small\". </p> <p>Robertson goes on to complain that Muslims, Jews, Hindus and Rastafarians are excluded in favour of \"white Anglo-German Protestants.\" What he calls the \"next step\" is to challenge the notion that the head of state is hereditary.</p> <p>Gosh. That takes us quite quickly down the republican road, where one party or another will seek to curry favour with voters by putting up a Rastafarian candidate for president. Those crafty Tories, I wouldn't put it past them. President Benjamin Zephaniah - it has a ring to it.</p> <p>Much more important, as Wintour's article notes, any changes to the bundle of laws which followed the overthrow of James II in 1688 are likely to create enormous repercussions, which might dominate a Labour fourth term, when these changes are supposed to happen.</p> <p>The Guardian's editorial line has long been arguing that we need a stock-taking of many constitutional issues - the over-centralised state, the royal prerogatives - exercised by the government, which accumulated them as royal power waned \u2013 the House of Lords and so on.</p> <p>In fact, Labour has been actively tackling all of the above, albeit in a rather random fashion. Power has been significantly devolved back to Edinburgh, Cardiff and (touch wood) Belfast, as well as London. The rest of Britain needs it too, but a formula that wins popular support (regional government was rejected in the north east) is yet to be found.</p> <p>The Lords has undergone more reform since 1997 than in a century of failed chatter. As for the prerogative powers, they are being tidied up, brought to greater accountability by the courts and - in the case of war-making powers - being specifically remitted to a vote of the Commons, as happened de facto over Iraq in 2003. The fact that it's been combined with some illiberal reforms is a reminder that change carries risk too.</p> <p>Personally, I've nothing against giving women an equal shot at the crown, Rastafarian women included. Princess Anne has many qualities more impressive than her brother. But the fact is that Charlie Windsor is older and has two sons. So it's a hypothetical, though in fairness the British crown never embraced the medieval Salic Law which banned women kings entirely in, say, France. </p> <p>As for the Catholic question, it was pretty hot in the years after 1688. Catholic France had taken over from Catholic Spain in its attempts to dominate the continent in the name of an autocratic \"divine right\" model of government which emerged from the Hobbesian chaos of the 16th and early 17th centuries.</p> <p>Just in case anyone missed it - no 24/7 TV in those days - Catholic James II, who succeeded his crafty brother Charlie in 1685, was dumb enough to attempt a pro-Catholic constitutional coup. Judges, local JPs, Westminster politicians, army officers, university dons, key officials, bishops too, they were all purged while Catholics were promoted.</p> <p>All this just after Louis XIV had revoked the toleration granted to French Protestants under the Edict of Nantes, a piece of crass stupidity which greatly boosted the emerging British economy by way of skilled emigration.</p> <p>So the Catholic exclusion issue was far from abstract then and remained active well into our own times. As I have pointed out before, Paul Johnson's editorship of the New Statesman was made probationary for six months in 1965 because Leonard Woolf (widower of Virginia) objected to his Papism.</p> <p>In our largely Godless times it has ceased to resonate, though that may be temporary. Personally, I keep a wary eye on the church's idea of authority, but have no objections if the Windsors follow the Blairs and others back to Rome. They are only figureheads, after all.</p> <p>The larger point is \"Do we want to tackle all this stuff in these troubled times?\" always assuming - a pretty big \"if\" - that Labour will be around for a fourth term to tackle it.</p> <p>I regard Britain as a republic with a fairly harmless method of choosing its titular president: heredity. Eccentric it may now been seen as, but it's quite popular and many people value it as a disinterested apolitical focus for loyalty to the state. </p> <p>When and if the monarchy ceases to resonate in that way \u2013 and the post-Diana echo is again getting fainter, it will simply fall off the tree without help like overripe fruit. That's my hunch. But don't bet on it. Monarchy is an old idea and surprisingly resilient even in our own \"rational\" era.</p>",
  "<p>It's almost two weeks since the fire in the Channel Tunnel, and although part of the Tunnel is still out of action, Eurostar appear to be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/sep/13/transport.channeltunnel1\">shifting their passengers</a>, albeit with some delay using a temporary timetable. </p> <h2>So what's actually happened?</h2> <p>The Channel Tunnel consists of two large rail tunnels (plus a smaller non-rail service tunnel), linked by crossovers roughly one third and two thirds across the Channel. The crossovers allow trains to switch tunnels, although the northern tunnel is normally for France-bound traffic, the southern for trains heading for the UK. A lorry on a Folkestone-Calais freight shuttle overturned and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/sep/12/transport.france\">caught fire</a> in the final third of the northern tunnel towards the French end, and for some time this put the whole northern tunnel out of action. With all trains forced to use the southern tunnel in both directions for the whole crossing, Eurostar could initially only offer a very limited timetable, leading to long queues at St Pancras and Paris Nord. The first third of the northern tunnel has now been reopened at the UK end, allowing Eurostar to increase its temporary service to 15 out of a normal 18 departures to Paris, and 6 out of a normal 10 to Brussels. The journey is taking around 20 minutes longer than normal, as both southbound and northbound trains must still queue to use the southern tunnel for two-thirds of the Channel transit. </p> <h2>If you're already booked on Eurostar</h2> <p>Eurostar's first priority is to accommodate all their pre-booked passengers on the fewer trains running under their temporary timetable. The message is, if your journey isn't essential and you'd prefer to travel at a later date, they will re-book you at no extra cost, but if you want or need to travel, check in as normal and they're usually able to accommodate you on the next available train. Eurostar admit that might mean a bit of a wait, as there are some long gaps in the temporary timetable, for example from 09:25 to 13:22, so if you've got onwards connections in Paris you might need to travel earlier to maintain your connection. Also bear in mind that the last trains of the day will leave London, Paris and Brussels earlier than they normally do. </p> <p>You'll find a copy of the temporary Eurostar timetable at <a href=\"http://www.eurostar.com\">eurostar.com</a> together with advice on the latest situation. </p> <h2>Can you still buy Eurostar tickets?</h2> <p>Eurostar now has some spare capacity available and has re-opened bookings once again on most of the trains in their temporary timetable. However, availability may be more limited than normal. </p> <h2>When will Eurostar be back to normal?</h2> <p>\"We just don't know,\" was Eurostar's honest answer. A completely normal service requires the whole of the northern tunnel to be open, and based on experience following a similar <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/sep/12/transport.channeltunnel1\">lorry fire in 1996</a>, that's likely to be months rather than weeks away. However, Eurostar hope that when the middle third of the northern rail tunnel is re-opened, perhaps in early October, they can add more trains to their temporary timetable. </p> <p>Eurostar appear to be coping reasonably well under the circumstances, and are doing their best to look after their pre-booked passengers. </p> <p>From a personal viewpoint, it's certainly not putting me off using Eurostar - I'm going to Fes in Morocco by train in early October. What about you?</p>",
  "<p>Russia has launched a full-scale investigation into last night's \"audacious\" assassination of Ruslan Yamadayev, a former MP and bitter rival of Chechnya's pro-Kremlin president Ramzan Kadyrov.</p> <p>Yamadayev, 46, was shot dead early yesterday evening outside the British embassy in central Moscow. He had stopped his black Mercedes at a red traffic light when his assailant, sitting in an Audi, opened fire.</p> <p>Yamadayev died instantly. His passenger, a former military commander in Chechnya, Sergei Kizyun, was seriously wounded. The killer then escaped, driving off along Moscow's river embankment and past its White House.</p> <p>Yamadayev's extended family has been involved in a bitter clan feud with Kadyrov, and represented one of the few sources of genuine opposition towards the president inside the violence-plagued and unstable Caucasus republic. </p> <p>His brother Sulim Yamadayev, a former Chechen rebel, was involved in a standoff with Kadyrov in April, when his convoy refused to yield when the president tried to drive past. Several people were reportedly killed in an ensuing gun battle.</p> <p>Kadyrov angrily dismissed Yamadayev as commander of the Vostok battalion, a group of ex-Chechen militants who defected to Moscow in 2003. He also issued a warrant for Yamadayev's arrest, accusing him and his family of murder, torture and other crimes.</p> <p>Today, a brother of Ruslan and Sulim alleged Kadyrov was behind last night's well-planned execution. Isa Yamadayev told Kommersant newspaper: \"Our family has information that he [Kadyrov] was preparing a reprisal.\"</p> <p>Today, however, Kadyrov denied involvement. Lema Gudayev, a spokeswoman for Kadyrov, told Interfax: \"He was shocked to learn about this. It is well known that Kadyrov's principled position was that a court should find out what crimes the brothers Yamadayev have in fact committed, and make a decision on their responsibility.\"</p> <p>Kadyrov, who became Chechen president in February 2007, has previously been accused of the murder of the campaigning journalist Anna Politkovskaya. Politkovskaya, an outspoken Kadyrov critic, was shot dead outside her Moscow apartment in October 2006. </p> <p>This morning's Russian newspaper ran gruesome front-page photos of Ruslan Yamadayev slumped on the driver's seat of his luxury Mercedes S600, his white shirt and chest covered with blood. \"President Kadyrov has lost his biggest enemy,\" Kommersant noted.</p> <p>According to Russian media reports, investigators are now examining several theories. These include that Ruslan was the victim of a mistaken identity, and that the real target was his brother Sulim. They are also examining whether his killing may have been linked to Yamadayev's lucrative casino business in Moscow.</p> <p>Officials have rushed to rule out Kadyrov's involvement, suggesting the Yamadayev family's support inside Chechnya, based in their stronghold in the Chechen city of Gudermes, is now negligible. </p> <p>Yamadayev fought against the Russian army during Chechnya's separatist war in the 1990s, but then defected to the Kremlin side during the second Chechen war, which began in 1999. </p> <p>In 2004, the then president, Vladimir Putin, rewarded his loyalty with a hero of Russia award. Yamadayev was also made a deputy in Russia's state Duma, and served until 2007 as a member of Putin's United Russia party.</p>",

Simpson said he saw no guns in the hotel room and did not ask anyone to bring weapons.</p> <p>Alexander, the first witness to admit carrying a weapon into the Palace Station Casino hotel room, said that they were in Las Vegas for a wedding.

I'm licensed to carry a gun'.\" </p> <p>He said Simpson told them to bring the guns but not take them out. He described a chaotic scene inside the hotel room, with Simpson yelling at the memorabilia dealers, and a friend, Michael McClinton, waving the gun and telling everyone to freeze, with wedding planner Clarence Stewart frisking everyone. </p> <p>At one point, he said, Simpson told McClinton to put down the gun.</p> <p>Alexander said he quickly realised he was in trouble.</p> <p>\"I was involved in an armed robbery.

He has been charged \"with an act contrary to good sportsmanship under law 10.4k.\" He must now appear before a three-man RFU disciplinary panel chaired by His Honour Judge Jeff Blackett, assisted by Peter Budge and Jeff Probyn.</p> <p>The range of punishments for Best's alleged offence vary from a six-week ban to a maximum two years. Best's Northampton team-mate, hooker Dylan Hartley, received a six-month suspension last year after being found guilty on two counts of eye-gouging. The incidents also happened against Wasps, and also involved Haskell, together with Wasps flanker Johnny O'Connor. Hartley's suspension meant he was ruled out of contention for a place in England's 2007 World Cup squad.</p>",
  "<p>Seeing as how everyone from Roky Erickson to Luther Vandross has been the subject of a tribute album, it comes as little surprise to find that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/aug/01/popandrock.suicide\">Suicide</a> are next in line for a similar kind of treatment. To mark the occasion of Alan Vega's 70th birthday, Blast First are about to release a series of EPs featuring a diverse range of artists (Springsteen, Primal Scream, Klaxons, Vincent Gallo, Julian Cope \u2026 ) covering <a href=\"http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/51468-bruce-liars-spiritualized-grinderman-cover-suicide\">the work of Vega and Rev</a>. The only surprising thing about this is that it's taken so long to transpire. Tribute albums tend to work most effectively when the subjects reside at the cult end of the musical spectrum - Naked in the Afternoon: a Tribute to Jandek, More Oar: a Tribute to Alexander \"Skip\" Spence and <a href=\"http://www.hihowareyou.com/\">The Late Great Daniel Johnston</a> immediately spring to mind. Given that Suicide are the most cultish of cult bands, you'd think we'd be knee-deep in Vega/Rev tribute records by now.</p> <p>If we accept that the Velvet Underground have long since been accepted into the mainstream rock canon, there's also a case to be made for Suicide as the most influential of all remaining cult bands. From post-punk to the rash of synth-and-voice duos that proliferated in the 80s, from industrial rock to techno, Suicide's fingerprints are all over it all. In the 38 years of their existence, Vega and Rev have not caused pop chart compilers too many sleepless nights. But name-checking them among your favourites has always been one of the most effective short cuts to super-hip credibility. Unless, that is, you happen to be a man trying to impress a lady. In which case, at least in my experience, Suicide's music is a guaranteed kiss of death.</p> <p>Suicide have loomed monstrously large in the long-running debacle that has been my romantic life, starting in 1978 when I took my first girlfriend Lynda to see <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiVvA9YQpiI\">the Clash</a>, with Suicide in support. The phlegm rained down with vehement bite that night, all of it intended for Vega, a good gallon of it landing on the head of my date. She broke up with me during the train ride home, accusing me of having the worst musical taste of any man that ever walked the earth. That's simply not true. I know of a man in Bournemouth who has much worse taste than me.</p> <p>Still, I didn't learn my lesson where Suicide were concerned. I went on to court a girl called Frankie. Early on in our relationship I thought it would be a beezer idea to compile her a C90 tape exclusively made up of songs with the name \"Frank\" or \"Frankie\" in the title. With acres of tape left after I was done with the obvious numbers, I opted to include Suicide's Frankie Teardrop which tells the heart-warming story of a Vietnam vet who kills his entire family before turning the gun on himself. After handing the tape over, I never heard from her again. Who knows? Maybe it was <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juAmEb_r1NA\">Eno's Blank Frank </a>she objected to.</p> <p>Surely, though, it was no coincidence that Valerie decided to dump me halfway through an Alan Vega solo show in New York in 1985. I'm also prepared to accept that Melinda started to go off me when I chose Suicide's Dream Baby Dream to soundtrack our bedroom gymnastics. And I'm starting to realise that it was never the same between me and my most recent partner after I treated her to a fun-packed night out involving a double-bill of Suicide and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuDP7c3Zd8I\">Grinderman </a>at The Forum.</p> <p>Has anyone else's love life been similarly cursed by a single band? Or is there any couple out there whose love and passion are sustained by the undeniable beauty that resides at the heart of Suicide's atonal terror? If so, I'd very much like to hear from you.</p>",

  "<p>If I could eliminate one force for bad in the world, it would be procrastination. Not greed, or anger or selfishness or Tories, though all those things are unpleasant too. Before you scoff, just imagine a world where people set out to do something and did it, rather than pairing up their socks or checking their email instead. </p> <p>Think what Einstein might have achieved if he hadn't played the violin. Or how much sooner WW2 might have ended if Churchill hadn't been an avid painter. And how much more productive you would be if you didn't precede every task with making a cup of tea.</p> <p>I may not be the best-placed person to give advice on cracking down on procrastination, as I postponed writing this to cast an imaginary remake of Birds of a Feather as directed by Quentin Tarantino. I got as far as Darryl Hannah as the tall, miserable one before realising I had fallen victim to the very evil I was fighting against. So I will tackle this from the inside.</p> <p>Ideally, you should begin by turning your computer off, for there is no better tool for wasting time. Options range from checking whether Val Kilmer was in Willow on IMDb, to Googling your own name, to finding out exactly what Robert Palmer is saying in Addicted To Love. It's incredible. All those thousands of tiny thoughts that run through your mind can be turned into at least five minutes of faffing. </p> <p>But for many of us work requires a computer, so you simply cannot turn it off. And barring yourself from the internet doesn't work either - you need email most of the time, and it's just annoying to have to go back to a world where you can't check the spelling of pulchritudinous without actually opening a dictionary. (The last sentence was a test. If you had the urge to Google pulchritudinous, you've failed.)</p> <p>In any case, even when there is no internet available distractions are plentiful. I once went to a cabin in the middle of nowhere for purposes of focusing on a task. It had no computer, no phone reception and no TV or radio. Little did I know that the owners of said cabin would leave board games lying around to taunt me. </p> <p>I fought the urge for a day before setting up and playing a solo game of Jenga. So you also need to purge your workplace of any games. This includes minesweeper. And rubber bands (which can be flicked, or made into balls). And probably paperclips, and definitely Blu-Tack. And highlighters. And don't sit on a spinny chair because that can be fun too. You should also get rid of amusing colleagues, sunshine, food, drink, attractive people and belly button fluff. </p> <p>But you can't. The sad truth is that the only way to prevent procrastination is self-discipline. Imagine, if you will, that your entire collection of whatever it is that you collect - stamps, seashells, fine wines, ex-boyfriends - will be taken away unless you complete the task in front of you. It would certainly put a new spin on things, and make the manufacture and consumption of tea less of a priority than it is currently.</p>",
  "<p>I never thought I would find myself in agreement with George Bush. On Friday I did.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/19/wallstreet.georgebush\"><br>Speaking at the White House</a> on the large scale federal intervention in the financial markets he stated that \"government intervention is not only warranted, it is essential\u2026America's economy is facing unprecedented challenges. We're responding with unprecedented measures.\" </p> <p>What the US and British government interventions highlight are the limits of markets to operate in a stable fashion in times of acute financial crisis. Instead, what we have seen is mass panic, collapses and a downwards spin into a financial black hole which could have ended with widespread financial collapse.</p> <p>The market is a wonderful device when it works properly. But markets are prone to failures, to the mispricing of risk and to manipulation and abuse. There is also no guarantee that free markets will operate in the public interest as <a href=\"http://www.adamsmith.org/smith/won-index.htm\">Adam Smith realised 200 years ago</a>.</p> <p>Believers in the self-regulating power of the market and free enterprise delude themselves if they think that the free market can fix all problems. It can't, and from time to time it gets into major trouble as a result of market excesses such that the whole edifice is in danger of collapsing. We were at such a moment in the world financial markets last week.</p> <p>The magnitude of the collapse caused by ill-judged mortgage lending and over-complex derivatives, and intensified by speculators and short sellers, has come close to bringing the financial system to its knees. It is on such an occasion that it is necessary for central governments to step in and do what is necessary to keep the system in being. </p> <p>Left to its own devices, parts of the global capitalist system would have crashed in flames several times in the last 40 years without government intervention to pick up the pieces. It's no use saying let the discipline of the market work it out. The consequences would be too painful. The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savings_and_Loan_crisis\">savings and loan crisis</a> 25 years ago is a case in point. </p> <p>The US Treasury and the Federal Reserve have done very well to date in intervening to keep the whole system from breaking off its bearings and crashing to the ground. The organised takeover of Bear Sterns, the decision to effectively take over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the bail out of American Insurance Group were clearly not enough. Hence the measures announced on Thursday to hive off the toxic waste into a special vehicle and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/18/regulators.stockmarkets\">prohibit short selling</a> of financial stocks in the US and the UK.</p> <p>Free marketers seem to believe that the US and UK government are behaving irrationally or unfairly in imposing tight controls in a time of crisis. They seem to think that speculators should be allowed free rein to push down share prices as they see fit and that we should live with the consequences of market failure. This is unrealistic.</p> <p>Senator Jim Bunning of Kentucky, an ultra conservative, has stated that: \"The free market for all intents and purposes is dead in America\", adding that the Treasury proposal would \"take away the free market and institute socialism in America\". How wrong he is. </p> <p>The government measures are not acting against the interests of capitalism and the free market. On the contrary, they are acting to preserve its long term stability and existence. The relationship between the state and capital in capitalist societies is a close one, where the role of the state is to ensure the preservation of the capitalist system. This is what we are seeing right now. </p> <p>The financial free marketeers chasing maximum profits have shot themselves in the foot by permitting the excesses of the last few years. Arguably governments should have done much more to control the risks much earlier. They did not, and we are now paying the price of what Alan Greenspan termed \"irrational exuberance\" but did little to control.</p> <p>The Federal Reserve Bank, the Bank of England and the FSA eventually came to the rescue and the system is likely to live another day. </p> <p>There will undoubtedly be major financial aftershocks as the scale of the debt becomes clearer. There will be more bank failures and takeovers, and not a few hedge funds are likely to go down in flames in coming weeks, but that is the price to be paid when the market fails and government has to step in to clear up the mess. It should exact a high price from the banks for the bail out.</p>",

  "<p><strong>Update as of 16/10/08:</strong> Nokia have now responded to this blog. Please see below*</p> <p>When Nokia announced their Comes With Music programme last year it was touted as a scheme that would give subscribers a year of unlimited downloads from a huge catalogue of tunes. What's more, they would be able to keep those downloads even after the subscription ends.</p> <p>It sounded like an amazing deal for the consumer, but it surprised a lot of artists \u2013 and probably most record labels too. How would artists and labels possibly earn any money from the content that Nokia planned to give away? Well, I suspect that Nokia jumped the gun before realising they'd have to pay both the record labels and songwriters. </p> <p>As with most of these deals, the details have been shrouded in secrecy. And though <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/23/AR2008092302428.html\">Nokia's Comes With Music UK launch party</a> is due to take place in London next Thursday, the <a href=\"http://www.musicmanagersforum.co.uk/ \">Music Managers Forum (MMF)</a> \u2013 the people who represent the artists - only found out the details last week, when one of the major labels involved invited them for a briefing. </p> <p>MCPS-PRS, the organisation that represents and collects royalties for the composers, hasn't yet come to an agreement with Nokia regarding how much the writers will be paid. When I asked MCPS-PRS about it I was told: \"The deal will be done for launch!\" Hopefully, it will be more advantageous for the composers than the YouTube deal they struck, which so far seems to be bringing in the pennies. </p> <p>These are the details of the Nokia Comes With Music scheme \u2013 as they have been given to the MMF by Sony BMG: the handset will have a \"wholesale\" price of \u00a350, of which \u00a331 will be attributable to sound recordings (this does not include the songwriters' payments, which the MCPS-PRS is currently negotiating). Therefore, the consumer will not be able to download an unlimited number of free tracks as first touted, rather a maximum of 120 in a year. This is because the lowest price per download that the labels agreed on would be 25.8p. If the consumer wants more tracks they can buy them (the price of which is yet to be revealed).</p> <p>However, it seems the staff at PC World are still under the impression that the consumer will get <a href=\"http://blogs.pcworld.com/staffblog/archives/007646.html\">unlimited free downloads</a> with the Comes With Music Nokia phone. I contacted Nokia's press office to ask if you would be able to download unlimited free downloads. They replied: \"Yes [users] will be able to download as many tracks as they want to.\" When I asked them to clarify if these downloads would be free, there was no response. </p> <p>Of course, since no one can predict which tracks (or how many) will be downloaded in a year, the record labels will have to wait till the end of the subscription year to see what their share of the \u00a331 per handset will be. Then the record labels will have to account to the artists, which hopefully means that the money won't all disappear into the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2008/may/20/anastutebusinesssenseand\">Black Box</a>. </p> <p>What's interesting is that the amount paid per track by Nokia, depends on how many tracks each subscriber has downloaded in a year. In other words, if they only download one track in a year \u2013 that track will be worth \u00a331 to the label/artist who recorded it. </p> <p>The reason the result and details of this scheme are so important is that this is just the first of many similar projects being rolled out in the coming year. Sony Ericsson is rumoured to announce a similar scheme shortly. Nokia's Comes With Music will most likely set a precedent \u2013 even for how this particular scheme will work in other countries, since the UK is where it's first launching. </p> <p>And there are still many questions that remain. Will independent labels be included in this deal? A source suggests key indies are in negotiations, but the general feeling is that while the idea is promising, the early deals that Nokia made has emptied the cupboard so it appears that there is little left for the indies. As the majors are quick to grab a big part of the equity in forthcoming services like the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/jul/23/bskyb.musicindustry\">Sky ISP downloading deal</a> and <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-myspace3apr03,0,7496443.story\">MySpace Music</a>, the independent labels either don't get a look-in or are offered whatever scraps are left. The Nokia deal is considered straightforward compared to MySpace Music \u2013 a venture that has the independent labels up in arms and will merit its own dedicated blog, coming up in the next few weeks. </p> <p>How much will the songwriters get? Obviously, Nokia will want to make profits from their handsets, so after \u00a331 is deducted from \u00a350 the composers look set to make a lot less than the performers. </p> <p>Artists and songwriters welcome new ideas and ventures that make their music legally accessible to as many fans as possible. What is worrying is that most of these deals are being made without consulting them at all. Judging from the details that SonyBMG provided the MMF, it looks like the Nokia deal isn't too bad. I guess we won't know for sure until the subscription year is up.</p> <p>*Nokia have since responded to this blog with the following statement: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"Just wanted to confirm that Comes With Music means that when you buy a Nokia Comes With Music device like the Nokia 5310, you get unlimited access to the millions of tracks in the Nokia Music catalogue and, once downloaded, they are yours to keep. Once you have bought a Nokia Comes With Music device, there is no per track cost for these unlimited downloads and no maximum of 120 tracks per year as referenced in your blog.\" </p> </blockquote> <p><br>Neither Nokia nor any of the labels or managers we've spoken to are able to confirm at present how the artists will get paid.</p>",

In place of foreign occupation, the city's inhabitants now endure the terror of <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2007/aug/05/world/fg-iraqgay5\">fundamentalist militias and death squads</a>.</p> <p>Those who are deemed insufficiently devout and pure are liable to be assassinated. </p> <p>The death squads of the Badr organisation and the Mahdi army are targeting gays and lesbians, according to UN reports, in a systematic campaign of sexual cleansing. They proudly boast of their success, claiming that they have already exterminated all \"perverts and sodomites\" in many of the major cities. </p> <p>You can view photos of a few of the LGBT victims of these summary executions <br><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/outrage/sets/72157600042494571/\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/outrage/sets/72057594087304767/\">here</a>. </p> <p>My friends in Iraq have relayed to me the tragic story of five gay activists, who belonged to the underground gay rights movement, <a href=\"http://iraqilgbtuk.blogspot.com/\">Iraqi LGBT</a>. </p> <p>Eye-witnesses confirm that they saw the men being led out of a house at gunpoint by officers in police uniform. Yes, Iraqi police! Nothing has been heard of the five victims since then. In all probability, they have been executed by the police \u2013 or by Islamist death squads who have infiltrated the Iraqi police and who are using their uniforms to carry out so-called honour killings of gay people, unchaste women and many others. </p> <p>The arrested and disappeared men were Amjad 27, Rafid 29, Hassan 24, Ayman 19 and Ali 21. As members of Iraq's covert gay rights movement, for the previous few months they had been <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/id/155656\">documenting</a> the killing of lesbians and gays, relaying details of the murders to the outside world, and providing safe houses and support to other gay people fleeing the death squads. </p> <p>Their abduction is just one of many outrages by anti-gay death squads. lslamist killers burst into the home of two lesbian women in the city of Najaf. They shot them dead, slashed their throats, and also murdered a young child who the women had rescued from the sex trade. The two women, both in their mid-30s, were members of Iraqi LGBT. They were providing a safe house for gay men on the run from death squads. By sheer luck, none of the men who were being given shelter in the house were at home when the assassins struck. They have since fled to Baghdad, and are hiding in an Iraqi LGBT safe house there. </p> <p>Large parts of Iraq are now under the de facto control of the militias and their death squad units. They enforce a harsh interpretation of sharia law, summarily executing people for what they denounce as \"crimes against Islam\". These \"crimes\" include listening to western pop music, wearing shorts or jeans, drinking alcohol, selling videos, working in a barber's shop, homosexuality, dancing, having a Sunni name, adultery and, in the case of women, not being veiled or walking in the street unaccompanied by a male relative. </p> <p>Two militias are doing most of the killing. They are the armed wings of major parties in the Bush and Brown-backed Iraqi government. The Mahdi army is the militia of Moqtada al-Sadr, and the Badr organisation is the militia of the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI), which is the leading political force in Baghdad's governing coalition. Both militias want to establish an Iranian-style religious dictatorship. The allied occupation of Iraq is bad enough. But if the Mahdi or Badr militias gain in influence and strength, as seems likely in the long-term, it could result in a reign of religious terror many times worse. </p> <p>Saddam Hussein was a bloody tyrant. I campaigned against his blood-stained misrule for nearly 30 years. But while Saddam was president, there was certainly no danger of gay people being assassinated in their homes and in the street by religious fanatics. </p> <p>Since his overthrow, the violent persecution of lesbians and gays is <a href=\"http://iraqilgbtuk.blogspot.com/2007/08/for-gays-in-iraq-life-of-constant-fear.html\">much worse</a>. Even children suspected of being gay are abducted and later found <a href=\"http://gaycitynews.com/site/index.cfm?newsid=17008362&amp;BRD=2729&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=568864&amp;rfi=8\">shot in the head</a>.</p> <p>Lesbian and gay Iraqis cannot seek the protection of the police, since the police are heavily infiltrated by fundamentalists, especially the Badr militia. The death squads can kill with impunity. Pro-fundamentalist ministers in the Iraqi government are turning a blind eye to the killings, and helping to protect the killers. Some \"liberation\". </p> <p>Iraqi LGBT is appealing for funds to help the work of their members in Iraq.

  "<p>Hugh Griffiths, the law lord who sat in judgment of the latest instalment of the Carlos Tevez affair, has played first-class cricket but he clearly did not think of the sporting implications of his ruling on Tuesday.</p> <p>In seeking \u00a330m compensation from West Ham United after they dropped out of the Premier League, Sheffield United have - through Griffiths' precedent - opened a door to all clubs who want to litigate their way out of relegation. </p> <p>Had Kevin McCabe, Sheffield United's owner, played a different hand his club might now be in the top flight. Having seen West Ham plead guilty in April 2007 for the illegal registration of Tevez, and suffer a fine of \u00a35.5m, Sheffield United appealed to the Premier League in July of that year. That appeal failed, on the grounds that the first judgment, though flawed, was not \"irrational\" or \"perverse\". </p> <p>Rather than then engage in a futile and time-consuming challenge through the high court, McCabe might have headed to the Football Association, for his case to be heard before the close season was out. If Lord Griffiths' judgment is applied, West Ham would have retrospectively been deducted three points, handing back Sheffield United's top-flight status.</p> <p>It would be interesting to find out how Griffiths decided he had jurisdiction over a matter which had already been considered by two Premier League tribunals and for which West Ham had been fined \u00a35.5m. Apparently we will not know what his grounds were until the Daily Mail gives us the next chapter from its leaked copy of the judgment. </p> <p>We learn from that newspaper that Scott Duxbury, West Ham's chief executive, had misled the Premier League when he told it he would destroy all agreements with Tevez's economic owners. Instead he continued to operate under their terms. </p> <p>Was this the \"new and compelling evidence\" that under the norms of British justice is required for a higher court to ignore the 800-year-old concept of double jeopardy? Griffiths' office was unable to track him down yesterday to respond to the Guardian's email requests for a transcript of the hearing and his judgment.</p> <p>The notion that the FA's arbitrations process, the rule K that was invoked by Sheffield United, is a higher court gives rise to the suspicion that this is merely the latest episode in the power struggle between Soho Square and the Premier League. The League and its counsel repeatedly urged the FA not to facilitate the arbitration, pointing out that West Ham had been tried and punished under its own systems at a time when both were among its member clubs.</p> <p>The FA's rule K states that it \"shall not operate to provide an appeal against the decision of a disciplinary commission or appeal board and shall operate only as the forum and procedures for a legal challenge on the grounds of a breach of contract to any such decision\".</p> <p>The FA set up the arbitration after Sheffield United claimed West Ham had been in breach of the implied contract that exists between two members of a league. But the Premier League's rule B13 (\"In all matters and transactions relating to the league each club shall behave towards each other and the league with the utmost good faith\") had dealt with this issue.</p> <p>In the first hearing Simon Bourne-Arton QC declined to deduct points for seven reasons. Among them were West Ham's guilty plea; that the club had changed hands since the offence; and that the new ownership drew the League's attention to the illegal contracts. </p> <p>Bourne-Arton's judgment was flawed - the appeals court judge who presided over the second tribunal, Sir Philip Otton, said he would have dealt with the untruths of West Ham executives more severely. But that does not in itself justify the decision to pursue an arbitration whose verdict rocks the very foundations of football.</p>",
  "<p>This is the time of year for the obituaries on cricketing careers of real significance. First Graeme Hick, deprived by injury of a final Worcestershire bow and now the Dazzler, battered into submission by the demands of the job he did so steadfastly for a decade and a half, and similarly denied a playing send-off.</p> <p>It was only typical that Darren Gough's body gave out before his spirit ever did. This summer has been a physical battle for him and the gut-busting effort, against Somerset at Scarborough a week since, proved his last hurrah. So Yorkshire go into their final match of the season, and beyond that, without their totem. He was still good enough to take the wicket of Justin Langer with him at the end, though, an Aussie to boot and a keepsake to remind him of the good times and what it was that drove him on.</p> <p>His retirement closes the book not just on a magnificent cricketer, nor even a magnificent international cricketer in both forms of the game, but a great England cricketer with all that entails. It was said of Ken Barrington that when he went out to bat you could almost see the Union Jack fluttering behind him and that is always the impression one got of Gough, chest puffed out, ruddy faced, cheeks blowing, hurling himself into the fray, often where others feared to tread. In his going I can see Turner's wonderfully evocative painting of the Fighting Temeraire, battle deeds done, being towed to the breakers' yard in Rotherhithe (Gough as the ghostly Temeraire not the perky steam driven tugboat to the fore, although that has some resonance too).</p> <p>His was a heart of oak, absolutely indefatigable, at his finest with full sails billowing, not least in alien conditions abroad. He bowled fast (not as fast as he might have imagined and, at times, when first it came on the scene, he appeared to get distracted by the lure of the speed gun, but rapid enough), skidded the ball on, swung it late away and had absolute control of the inswinging yorker, natural or reversed. The bouncer when it came, was a skimmer and all the more dangerous for that, making the choice between avoidance and playing the ball that much more difficult. </p> <p>There were more variations on a theme than even Elgar could have managed. His habitual full length invited jousts, so that he traded punches, speculating to accumulate, any punishment accepted with equanimity, in the belief that his moment would come. It brought him 229 Test match wickets, which is considerable but does him scant justice placing him lower in the pantheon than he deserves: he was better than that, much better, his tally diluted by the matches missed because of the debilitating knee condition that blighted the last half a dozen years. You can bet that it still rankles that Andy Caddick, his England bowling partner for much of his career but also a great rival, managed more.</p> <p>It is five years since his Test career ended, his knee unable to take the strain any longer. That appeared to be that. So we wrote him off. It was not, knowing the nature of the fellow, a sensible thing to do. He researched, took himself off to an orthopaedic specialist in Germany - who lubricated his creaking joints - and spent hours in the gym, employing a personal trainer. If he was not rejuvenated, then he was rehabilitated to the extent that he regained his place in the England one-day side. And if that was more by default, a comment more on the quality of competition, then it was still one in the eye for those who thought they had seen the last of him.</p> <p>He raged against the dying of the light and quite right too. But if that light has gone out now, the stage lights have been switched on in their stead. What next? Panto? Game shows? Please God not more lycra. Come on down. He always said he'd be good at that. He'd want to be the best, mind.</p>"
