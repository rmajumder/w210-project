  "<p>It was Luiz Felipe Scolari's redeployment of Mikel John Obi that swung dominance Chelsea's way at Stamford Bridge after Manchester United had held the ascendancy in the early stages and taken the lead. </p> <p>The Chelsea manager asked Mikel to make a positive change of positioning after about half an hour, pushing him further forward to support Frank Lampard and Michael Ballack rather than protecting the back four. Chelsea wrested midfield control by overloading in that area and monopolising the ball and it gave Lampard and Ballack a chance to make their runs further forward.</p> <p>Significantly, it also forced Wayne Rooney deeper. It was Rooney's job to pick up Mikel when United lost forward possession so he had to track back and that left Dimitar Berbatov isolated. </p> <p>Rooney was his usual workaholic self but Berbatov strolled while United were under siege and the visitors' only line of attack after Paul Scholes went off was Cristiano Ronaldo's speedy counters. Salomon Kalou's equaliser was just reward for Chelsea.</p> <p>Ronaldo and Carlos Tevez had started on the bench, with Sir Alex Ferguson not tempted to overload his front talent. He selected the energy of Park Ji-sung, Darren Fletcher and Owen Hargreaves in midfield, his tactic being to play with control and restraint, using Hargreaves to contain the forward movement of Ashley Cole down Chelsea's left, and Park to match Jose Bosingwa's surges on the other flank. </p> <p>United had the better of the game to begin with, Berbatov's unhurried play giving Scholes and Rooney good opportunities to support. United's lead was deserved and owed as much to the touch of Berbatov and the vision of Rooney as the dash of Patrice Evra's run.</p> <p>Chelsea tried to respond but with Bosingwa and Ashley Cole pinned back, Florent Malouda looking a \"nearly man\" and Joe Cole failing to assert himself, it needed Scolari's repositioning of Mikel to bring Chelsea the upper hand.</p> <p>Mikel does not yet have the astuteness of Claude Makelele or the dynamism of Michael Essien but what powerful potential. Even then, with Nicolas Anelka's timing awry, it seemed Chelsea might miss out until Kalou earned them a point.</p>",
  "<p>Thabo Mbeki yesterday resigned as South Africa's president and said he will leave office on a date set by parliament, after he was toppled by his own party following a long and bitter power struggle with his former deputy, Jacob Zuma.</p> <p>Mbeki called an emergency meeting of his cabinet as many of his ministers threatened to resign in solidarity after the African National Congress on Saturday told the president to agree to step down or face being removed by parliament.</p> <p>Mbeki handed his resignation letter to the speaker of parliament yesterday and in an unusually humble speech broadcast on national TV broadcaster SABC said he had decided to quit out of loyalty to the party that is rejecting him. </p> <p>\"I have been a loyal member of the African National Congress for 52 years. I remain a member of the ANC and therefore respect its decisions. It is for this reason that I've taken the decision to resign as president of the republic,\" he said. </p> <p>But Mbeki \"categorically\" denied the central accusation against him that was the immediate cause of his forced resignation. </p> <p>ANC leaders moved against the president after prosecutors said they would appeal against a high court decision that threw out corruption charges against Zuma, and accused Mbeki and his officials of abusing the courts as part of the power struggle over control of the party.</p> <p>The president said he and his cabinet had not interfered in decisions as to who to prosecute. \"This applies equally to the painful matter relating to the court proceedings against the president of the ANC, comrade Jacob Zuma,\" he said. </p> <p>The constitution requires the deputy president, Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, to take over as acting president, or the cabinet to appoint one from among themselves as soon as Mbeki resigns. Within 30 days, parliament then selects an interim president to complete the rest of Mbeki's term before a general election in about nine months.</p> <p>The ANC is believed to favour a close Zuma ally for the role, the speaker of parliament and party chairperson, Baleka Mbete. </p> <p>Zuma, who won the leadership election against Mbeki for control of the ANC late last year, is not a member of parliament and therefore cannot be appointed. </p> <p>But it is clear that he and his faction will soon be in charge of the government, solidifying a shift in power that began when Mbeki was removed as party leader.</p> <p>It marks the end of nine years of Mbeki rule that began with the promise of South Africa leading an African renaissance, but ended with the humiliation of a president toppled by his alienation of much of his own party, in part because of policy differences with the left, but also because of his vindictive style of rule.</p> <p>But many South Africans also see Mbeki's downfall as principally intended to protect Zuma from prosecution for allegedly accepting bribes related to a multibillion-dollar arms deal. </p> <p>The outgoing president set out what he sees as his legacy in building the economy, bringing peace to parts of Africa and empowering women. </p> <p>However, Mbeki acknowledged that despite consistent economic growth, millions of South Africans remain mired in poverty. </p> <p>Mbeki's resignation was welcomed by many. Critics of the president's widely derided policies on Aids, such as Zackie Achmat, head of the Treatment Action Campaign, say he has abandoned hundreds of thousands of people in need of lifesaving treatment and should be called to account.</p> <p>\"This is long overdue,\" said Achmat. \"Personally, I would have liked to see him impeached for causing the deaths of many hundreds of thousands of people living with HIV; for the corruption of the arms deal; for the undermining of every independent state institution.\"</p> <p>The leader of the opposition Democratic Alliance, Helen Zille, accused the ANC of putting its own political battles ahead of the national interest. </p> <p>\"It is revenge, pure and simple. It has everything to do with the internal battles of the ANC and nothing to do with the interest of South Africa,\" she said.</p> <p>FW de Klerk, the last white president of South Africa, who negotiated an end to apartheid, was also critical of Mbeki's dismissal.</p> <p>\"All that I would like to say at the moment is that it is unfortunate that a sitting president should be forced from office before the end of his term,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>'Analysing comedy is like dissecting a frog. Nobody laughs and the frog dies.\" </p> <p>So claims the legendary Barry Cryer. Indeed, there is nothing more damaging to a joke than trying to explain it. It's like revealing how the lady is sawn in half or telling someone who hasn't seen the Sixth Sense that Bruce Willis is a ghost (sorry). But even in a cursory examination of writing comedy, I'm afraid some frogs are going to die. </p> <p>There are comedic rules and formulae and, while these tenets should be respected, especially by a newcomer, perversely you can still succeed by openly contradicting them. Because comedy is about breaking the rules. Even its own rules. Though, as with many disciplines, it is wise to master the basics before you attempt to subvert them.</p> <p>Comedy is also so subjective that a script that reduces one audience to tears of laughter, can leave another staring at you in threatening silence. </p> <p>So how do you even come up with a joke? Richard Pryor gave the excellent advice, \"Be truthful and funny will come.\" Though of course veracity is not enough on its own, it can often be extremely boring or depressing. Conversely many comics make a great living telling downright lies.</p> <p>Often ideas come from a subconscious flash of inspiration. Dara O'Briain discusses how Douglas Adams described how Arthur Dent learned to fly: \"apparently the way to do it is to fall and then get distracted. At which point you forget you've just fallen and take off. That essentially is the best description of writing jokes, you trigger yourself to not think about something and then something comes out.\"</p> <p>This epiphany can come from the collision of two idle thoughts, the juxtaposition of unlikely events, questioning conventional wisdom or by viewing society without preconceptions. It's why children so often say funny things, because they have not yet learnt about conformity and notice the hypocrisy that adults are too jaded to spot. So you always have to be primed to see the humour in the everyday life, but perversely not desperately be searching for it.</p> <p>How can you hurry the comedy along? Some writers use artificial stimulants such as alcohol or drugs. As a younger man I felt I wrote better after consuming a dangerous cocktail of chocolate and diet coke. Though booze can sometimes help you relax a little and hallucinogens can alter your perspective, on the whole you're better off staying clean. If logic breaks down, comedy doesn't usually follow. We all know that what appears funny when you're inebriated can seem embarrassing the morning after. </p> <p>A comic's mind usually retains some childishness (and not always in a pejorative sense). Perhaps there's some insanity in there too, but the comedian (usually) has control over their madness. </p> <p>Personally I find that deadlines are the best inspiration. I like leaving things to the last possible minute, then letting blind panic be my stimulus. </p> <p>Wasting time is part of the process. For me genius is \"1% inspiration and 99% procrastination.\" Graham Linehan says, \"It's the nature of writing, that you procrastinate and procrastinate until it gets to 4 o'clock and ... and then it's tea time.\" I will do anything but sit at my desk, but all the time, ideas are ruminating around in the back of my mind and then suddenly after six hours of Guitar Hero, something concrete emerges from the void.</p> <h2>About your tutor</h2> <p>Richard Herring is a comedian, writer and one half of Lee and Herring, from the cult BBC2 sketch shows Fist of Fun and This Morning With Richard Not Judy.

  "<p>In the early 90s I met Jimmy Tarbuck backstage at a show. I told him I was a struggling comic. \"Good luck!\" he said as he puffed on his cigar, \"comedy is the hardest job in the world!\"</p> <p>I don't agree with Tarbuck. It's not as hard as being a fireman or a brain surgeon or in the SAS or (given that you work for 20 minutes a night and then get drunk), as hard as working in an office. Still, most people would rather eat their own liver with some fava beans and a nice Chianti than perform stand-up comedy.</p> <p>At its best, stand-up comedy is the purest and most immediate medium for comedy and possibly even self-expression. What other outlet allows you to have an idea in the afternoon and then try it out that evening to an actual audience? </p> <p>The jokes, although important, are not in themselves enough. You need to be able to appear relaxed and confident, control the room, think on your feet, involve the audience without letting them steal focus from you, and adapt your style and material to dozens of different, difficult scenarios. The only way to gain these skills is to get up on stage and do gigs. As many nights a week as you can. Probably for at least five years. </p> <p>All those things will come to you, if you have the right stuff. So if you're starting out, then what you need to concentrate on is your material. Most clubs have an open spot where an unpaid wannabe can do five minutes. The audience will be quick to judge you and you're trying to get booked, so start small. Write a five-minute script (don't overrun), with a punchline every 30 seconds, with your best three jokes at the start and another belter at the end. Make sure that the jokes are original. Make sure you know exactly what you're going to say. Practice and be prepared for failure. </p> <p>Once you feel comfortable on stage you might have the confidence to try out stories or even to reveal your personal secrets. Be truthful and funny will come.</p> <p>You will also find that you do a lot of your \"writing\" on stage. When you are in the zone you find you can leave behind the script and just chat. Inspiration strikes and you discover new avenues, even in well trodden routines.</p> <h2>Josie Long on writing for stand-up</h2> <p>If you want to start writing stand-up, try not to feel like there are any conventions you have to subscribe to. There are no established rules as to what your show should contain.</p> <p>Try to find your own voice. Think about what you find funny and what you would want to see if you were watching. It's not helpful to second-guess the audience's tastes in advance. It's better to take risks and perform material that may not work if it is something you genuinely think is hilarious. Everyone has bad gigs and through them you will develop and evolve as a performer.</p> <p>All of that having been said, it's good to be economical with your material. Only use things you feel are essential. It's not just about enjoying yourself onstage, but about finding a way of conveying your sense of humour to other people.</p> <p>Try as many different ways of writing as you can, and try to write as much and as often as possible. Don't decide against trying a joke because it doesn't fit the style you've chosen for yourself. Include any ideas for jokes you have.</p> <p>Write at home on paper, steal your best conversations, do specific research, write by speaking out loud on your own, play writing games, take good ideas onstage then bat them around and improvise, note down things you see or are struck by ... you never know what will develop into a longer routine or piece.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Josie Long won the Edinburgh Festival's best newcomer award in 2006</p>",
  "<p>In sickness and in health, New Labour has always had a problem with the media. For the past year, even before the economy went into freefall, it has been open season against Gordon Brown. Was the falling out inevitable? And if so, who is to blame? </p> <p>The enemies, as Downing Street regards them, can be divided into four categories: the ideologically opposed, the masters' servants, the nihilists, and the jilted lovers. Group one might have flirted with the Blair brand in 1997, but reverted to type well before they were left out in the rain on millennium night. They belong to the rare breed that actually believes New Labour to have been dangerously left-wing.</p> <p>The second bunch comprises journalists who do as instructed by their editors and proprietors. They go easy, or stick the boot in, to order. The current fashion is to find fault in every action or utterance. However, in Brown's \"honeymoon\" last summer, these same journalists just as unquestioningly saw brilliance in his stumbling utterings as he arrived at No 10. </p> <p>Group three is the home for traditional journalists, who see the machinations of Westminster as an opportunity for a frolicking good story. Moderation or subtlety is frowned upon. Every unscripted remark is reduced to a \"gaffe\", each disagreement a \"row\".</p> <p>The final group are people on the left who vested in Brown an expectation that he would be unlike Blair, that he would actually stand for something and take on some vested interests on the right. With little self-criticism, the idol worshippers have become the undertakers. </p> <p>Brown has been able to count on only two types of journalist. The tribal supporters continue to believe, as one MP puts it, that \"the worst day of a Labour government is still better than the best day of a Tory one\". Then there is a group who believe the job of journalists is not to get above their station, and to show respect for elected representatives. Each group has dwindled to a tiny rump.</p> <p>Labour's media strategy has taken different forms over the years. It began with the Mandelson-Campbell philosophy that the feral beast could be tamed only through warfare. Difficult journalists were bullied or cajoled into the fold. After Hutton came the more subtle practices of David Hill and Tom Kelly. They acknowledged legitimate stories for what they were, and interfered less. Both approaches enjoyed limited strategic success. But at least these were professionals who followed the industry's basic rules - avoid diary clashes for important events and seek to ensure that interviewees produce a coherent argument.</p> <p>Brown's media team, led by the pugilistic Damian McBride, has been close to a shambles. In that respect it is no different to other parts of Downing Street. Yet it remains a mystery why the current prime minister, a man who obsessively reads the media, has allowed his media operation to slide so far so fast. The practices may have been poor, but some of the original intentions were laudable. Brown apparently encouraged cabinet ministers to be more candid, but the result (as with Alistair Darling's honest and correct assessment of the economy or other ministers' barbed remarks about their boss) has, to put it mildly, not been what he wanted.</p> <p>Whatever their complaints about their own treatment, Labour MPs are justified in one criticism. Most news organisations have given David Cameron an easy ride - papers' comment and news sections have both been lenient. Difficult stories tend to be glossed over. (For example, I struggled to see the follow-up to a recent Sunday Times story about Michael Ashcroft's finances). Assessments of Conservative policy have tended to adopt a generous tone.</p> <p>The same treatment was afforded Blair in the mid-1990s (and I don't recall Blair's spin doctors complaining then). One indulgence, however, does not justify the other. There is scope for considerably tougher reporting. Surprisingly, given the need for newspapers to stand out from the crowd, most political journalists still feel the urge to follow the herd. This, if only in commercial terms, appears to make little sense. </p> <p>For the most part, New Labour has been the author of its media misfortune. As many of us were telling them from the outset, and some of them now accept, the fraught relationship was less the cause, more the manifestation, of a deeper malaise - a lack of political courage. Any government that is frightened of standing up for its values, which would rather curry favour with its ideological opposites, will be at the mercy of forces beyond its control.</p>",
  "<p>In the back of a limo a boy rings a girl to tell her he won't be able to make their date. She looks down at the remains of the Chinese takeaway she's ordered in as a surprise for the two of them, and tells him it's fine, as though her heart isn't really breaking. In the background, LCD Soundsystem's mournful New York, I Love You, But You're Bringing Me Down plays on. </p> <p>The voiceover kicks in over shots of Manhattan and the credits roll. Then comes the kicker: \"Tonight's Gossip Girl featured music by the Pierces, the Fratellis, Seabear, Santogold and LCD Soundsystem. To download the music head to CWTV.com.\"</p> <p>Should you choose to follow those instructions you'd find further riches in store. Literally in store. For America's The CW channel, home of Gossip Girl, America's Next Top Model and the new 90210 remake among others, isn't just a television channel - here, the show you watch is linked to the fashion you buy or the music you download.</p> <p>\"Our target group, which is mainly women between the ages of 18 and 34, are the sort of people whose main interest lies in music and fashion,\" says The CW's head of marketing, Rick Haskins. \"They hear the music on the show and see the clothes and think, I wonder where I could get that dress that Leighton [Meester who plays Gossip Girl's Blair Waldorf] is wearing, or I love that tune and I'd like to download it now.\" In addition, Haskins says, CWTV.com functions as a place where people can discuss the music or clothes they are contemplating buying. </p> <p>In other words, The CW is an example of viral marketing at its best. Which brings, of course, financial rewards for the channel - the biggest of which is a multimillion-dollar deal with the phone company Verizon Wireless, which saw off fierce competition from AT&amp;T, Sprint and T-Mobile, and in exchange has a high product placement on Gossip Girl in addition to overseeing the music downloaded through the site. </p> <p>As for fashion, the website allows viewers to identify clothes from the programme and click to buy them. These transactions are handled by StarBrand Media, whose founder, Travis Schneider, admitted last year that 50% - close to 1m hits - of his site's traffic comes from Gossip Girl fans.</p> <p>There are other chances to buy too: on the Gossip Girl microsite you don't just find the music you've heard on that evening's episode, but also playlists for the various characters. And, while Gossip Girl remains the most interlinked of The CW's shows, you can also check out what the new kids in the 90210 remake are down with, download Smallville's background music or channel Dean from Supernatural's \"rebel with a demonic cause\" chic. \"The people we aim our shows at are what I would call the Now Generation,\" Haskins says. \"They see something or they hear something on a show and they want it now and that's what we're giving them.\"</p> <p>But what if that audience is younger than 18? Haskins and The CW's president of entertainment, Dawn Ostroff, are adamant that they are aiming for the 18-34 demographic, but both Gossip Girl and the new 90210 focus on and are watched by teenagers. </p> <p>\"To be honest, we take the view that that is the parents' responsibility,\" Haskins says. \"It's up to them whether or not they allow their child to use our site. We are providing a service - we're saying if you like the music from a show or the fashion of a show then you can come to our site, and it provides links to where to buy the clothes or download the music but no one is forcing you to.\" </p> <p>Last April, a provocative campaign featuring two of Gossip Girl's stars kissing with the words OMFG plastered over the top was condemned by the Parents Television Council, who complained that the programme was \"the most watched show among girls aged between 12 and 17 and glamorises casual sex and drug use among teens\". The ad campaign was subsequently rejected by a slew of American magazines including Entertainment Weekly, In Touch, TV Guide and People.</p> <p>This season's marketing? More provocative stills of the photogenic young cast with condemnatory quotes from sources including the New York Post, the Boston Herald and, naturally, the Parents Television Council plastered above them. Even Gossip Girl's creator, Josh Schwartz, claimed to be uncomfortable with it.</p> <p>Of course, even if The CW didn't plan to appeal directly to teens, under-18s are an increasingly lucrative market. Disney has always understood that - hence the success of Disney shows such as High School Musical and Hannah Montana. Thus Macy's stock a range of Hannah Montana clothing, while High School Musical has its own store offering everything from pink T-shirts to DVDs, posters and CDs. </p> <p>But those responsible say the marketing isn't just about profit, but also about helping programmes to stand out in a crowded market. \"The key to our shows' success can be seen in other ways, for example One Tree Hill has consistently broken new music. Look at [folk singer] Kate Voegele - she broke out into the mainstream after appearing on that show,\" says Ostroff. </p> <p>In addition, The CW says that the channel's web activity involves much more than shopping: \"We take web 2.0 really seriously at The CW,\" Haskins says. \"Our website is not just about being able to download the music or buy the clothes, it's about social networking and allowing our audience to interact with the show.\" </p> <p>In other words, according to The CW we shouldn't just watch our favourite shows, we should live our lives as our favourite characters live theirs, wearing their clothes (such as Blair's \u00a3160 Marc Jacobs pumps), playing their music and discussing their (imaginary) film choices. \"There is definitely a sense in which we want to create a whole lifestyle and culture at our network,\" says Ostroff. \"The aim is that people watch The CW because they are attuned to pop culture. If anything we want to be a few steps ahead of our audience, so that they watch us in order to find out what's new in music, fashion, art or even technology.\"</p> <p>But what does all this mean for television in the future? Is it all about producing the equivalent of a high-end magazine on screen? Ostroff remains sanguine. \"The bigger broadcast networks are not as bound towards niche-marketing, but we are a young network and that kind of programming is the best way for us to survive,\" she says. \"Those bigger networks do a fantastic job but I think we're going to see a real challenge in how you stay relevant and stand out in today's climate. Ultimately that's in our favour.\"</p>",
  "<p>The BBC has just achieved record ratings for its Paralympics coverage. But is that enough? We ask: how can TV improve its coverage and portrayal of disability?</p> <p><strong>Roger Mosey, director of sport, BBC (soon to take Olympic post)</strong><br>This sounds dangerously like a corporate mantra but I'm an advocate here of \"fewer, bigger, better\". When I came to BBC Sport there was a bit too much token squeezing of disability sports into odd slots on Grandstand - and I don't think that actually gave the proper profile. The Paralympics, to which we gave record amounts of airtime this year, worked because they were fantastically well staged; and you had large, passionate crowds watching elite-performance sport. </p> <p>If you think about some UK-based disability events, like the Paralympic World Cup, there's still great sport on show, but it was disappointing to see such sparse attendances in Manchester this year.</p> <p>So my lesson for the future would be to concentrate on a smaller number of disability events - but make them as big and as powerful as you can.</p> <p><strong>Richard McKerrow, creative director, Love Productions</strong><br>Disabled people are virtually invisible on mainstream British TV, in news or current affairs and especially in drama. Yes, you get the odd documentary, some news reports on disabled issues and characters in dramas who happen to suddenly develop a disability. But where, crucially, are the disabled reporters and presenters reporting on everyday events? Where are the characters, who just happen to be disabled, in our soaps and mainstream dramas? We need to take some lessons from US drama where there is a far better reflection of society. Until this happens we will remain afraid of disability and we will need to carry on trying to make provocative disabled series that challenge mainstream thinking, like our programme Britain's Missing Top Model.</p> <p><strong>Andrew Thompson, head of sport, Channel 4</strong><br>There's no doubt about it, the Beijing Paralympics have been a huge success, with some wonderful human stories - great characters, as well as great athletic performances. At Channel 4 we are about to screen the UK School Games, for the second year running. In our two programmes we integrate the athletes, so viewers can watch a 400m race, that is then followed by a race in wheelchairs, which is just as it happened in the event. I'm sure this is a positive step forward.</p> <p><strong>Bernie Corbett, general secretary, Writers' Guild of Great Britain</strong><br>Anyone might be disabled. Not just a key character in a drama or comedy. Not all disabled people occupy a wheelchair. How can TV get disability out of special treatment and into background radiation?

Tokenism won't work.</p> <p>Here's an idea. Get the list of characters, close your eyes and stab with a Biro.

  "<p>O Wasps, where is thy sting? Three straight defeats mark the champions' worst start to a Premiership campaign and next up is a trip to the leaders, Leicester, on Friday night. Wasps were fortunate to scrape a bonus point against a Northampton side more cohesive and united than the one which was relegated two seasons ago, and they face losing the forwards James Haskell and Richard Birkett, who tonight face charges for serious foul play after being cited following the defeat to Worcester last week.</p> <p>The Saints decided to kick Wasps while they were down, and the strategy yielded a return after 46 seconds. Bruce Reihana booted long from his own 25 and chased more in hope than expectation. Josh Lewsey misjudged the flight, the ball bounced over his head and, after he had retrieved it, took too long over his return punt and Reihana plundered a chargedown try.</p> <p>Lewsey had given away the try to Worcester when he had failed to deal with a garryowen, and when the imperious Carlos Spencer planted a high ball into the Wasps' 25 on 23 minutes, Lewsey waited while Neil Best leapt and flicked the ball into the arms of Chris Ashton. The hapless Lewsey, by then shunted to the wing, almost conceded a bonus try at the end when he failed to deal with a rolling kick to his line, but Ashton slipped with the line at his mercy.</p> <p>Lewsey's loss of form leaves England with a problem at full-back for November's internationals, but the player said: \"The reason Wasps have been successful for a number of years now is that we do not indulge in back-stabbing when things go wrong. We will stay tight, keep working hard and the tide will turn. We are paying for unforced errors and for getting turned over at the breakdown. I have made mistakes but we will battle out of this. That is what championship sides are made of.\"</p> <p>Wasps did not enjoy superiority in any area of the game, unless giving away penalties is taken into account. England's leading referee, Chris White, awarded 34 in all (one a free-kick), on an afternoon which again showed the absurdity of the International Rugby Board's directive to make the breakdown an offence-free zone. Officials have no option but to go along with the edict but they are showing their disdain for the measure by not sending offenders to the sin-bin, despite the high penalty counts.</p> <p>The shame was that both sides started with a positive attempt. The Saints, with Spencer at his impish best showing how much Wasps were missing Danny Cipriani, were prepared to run from deep but as the penalty count mounted both sides fell back into a kicking routine. The ball was kicked out of hand 49 times, the majority in the second period when earnest intent had been replaced by weary resignation. Both sides fashioned one try by moving the ball through hands, Stephen Myler's long pass for Sean Lamont's score probably the highlight of the afternoon, but the impact the law variations and directive have had can be seen in the muted role that Riki Flutey, so influential last season, is playing: he is hardly seeing the ball and the trend will soon be for boshers rather than creators, at inside-centre.</p> <p>Northampton's one concern was wasteful goal-kicking. Reihana missed four penalties which, when his side trailed 20-17 eight minutes from the end of normal time, looked like being costly, but the Saints held their nerve. \"I have been working very hard on my kicking,\" he said. \"This was a big win for us and we are a totally different side from the one which was in the Premiership last time. We have a different attitude. We are very much together now.\"</p> <p><strong>Northampton</strong> Reihana (capt); Ashton, Ansbro, Downey (Myler, 65), Lamont; Spencer, Dickson (Foden, 61); Tonga'uiha (Smith, 64), Hartley, Murray (Stewart, 64), Fern\u00e1ndez Lobbe (Rae, 65), Day, Best, Gray, Wilson.</p> <p><strong>Sin-bin</strong> Hartley 48.</p> <p><strong>Tries</strong> Reihana, Ashton, Lamont. <strong>Cons</strong> Reihana 2, Myler. <strong>Pen </strong>Reihana.</p> <p><strong>Wasps</strong> Lewsey; Sackey, Waldouck, Flutey, Voyce; Walder, Reddan (Robinson, 64); Payne (Barnard, h-t), Ward (Webber, 40), Vickery (capt), Birkett (Leo, 68), Palmer, Worsley, Haskell (Betsen, 74), Hart.</p> <p><strong>Sin-bin</strong> Webber 48.</p> <p><strong>Try</strong> Waldouck. <strong>Pens</strong> Walder 5.</p> <p><strong>Referee</strong> C White (Cheltenham). <strong>Attendance</strong> 13,021.</p>",
  "<p>The sin-binning of Robin Sowden-Taylor in the second half proved costly for Cardiff Blues as Munster turned their numerical advantage into 14 points and fought their way to victory to go top of the league. </p> <p>Too many breakdown offences had Sowden-Taylor banished to the sidelines in the 51st minute and the home side took full advantage to put Paul O'Connell and Niall Ronan over for converted tries. Having trailed 17-7 the European champions then crowned their comeback with a fourth try for a bonus point.</p> <p>Munster had made the best possible start when a neat grubber kick from Rua Tipoki was gobbled up by Ronan for a second-minute try, converted by Ronan O'Gara. But Ben Blair kicked a penalty from inside his own half as Cardiff began to settle. Aided by some forward grunt and clever direction from the fly-half, Ceri Sweeney, Cardiff kept Munster on the back foot and then released the wing Richard Mustoe, who stepped past Peter Stringer and Barry Murphy to score his first try for the Welsh club in the 34th minute.</p> <p>Leading 10-7 at half-time, the visitors continued to apply pressure and were rewarded for their good ball-retention when a huge up-and-under from Sweeney bounced off Denis Hurley's shoulder and Jamie Roberts carried on before unleashing Maama Molitika for the line. Blair added the conversion and Munster were suddenly staring at their third successive Magners League defeat to Cardiff here.</p> <p>But little by little the Irish side fought back and, after Sowden-Taylor incurred Peter Allan's wrath, O'Connell, the Munster captain, stretched over from a five-metre ruck for a galvanising seven-pointer and they went 21-17 ahead on the hour when Ronan crossed for his second try. </p> <p>Munster's No8, Justin Melck, sealed the victory with an easy try after Cardiff lost control of a lineout ball near their own line on 69 minutes. Although Blair reduced the margin to 28-20 with a penalty three minutes later the former All Black, who had broken Ulster hearts with his last-ditch kick last weekend, failed to secure a bonus point, slicing a straightforward penalty wide in the closing stages.</p> <p>The Munster manager, Tony McGahan, praised his team's resolve as they celebrated their ascent to the top of the league after recording three wins in their past three games. \"We're trying to play a positive, running brand of rugby,\" he said. \"It suits the players we have and has evolved with the introduction of the young guys we have.

  "<p>Nicklas Bendtner has not enjoyed the steepest of career trajectories. Sent off in his first league start against Everton last December, he earned further notoriety by scoring an own-goal in the Carling Cup game with Spurs and for good measure was seen to be headbutted by his team-mate Emmanuel Adebayor in the same match, none of which has made him quite his ascetic manager's cup of tea.</p> <p>That he has begun only nine Premier League games for Arsenal tells its own story, yet the young Danish striker's brand of cocky aggression could be the missing ingredient the Gunners need if their title assault is not to fizzle out into another season of what might have been.</p> <p>Arsenal have frequently been accused of being a soft touch for Bolton who, such is their commitment, have had six players sent off in their games against Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's side. But with Bendtner giving a fearless display of the centre-forward's art while ably supported by a livewire midfield, the Gunners had the muscle to deal with Bolton's hustle. Wenger was delighted with his team's application, insisting not only that youth would be no hindrance to their pursuit of honours but that experience could be an obstacle in itself. \"When you are 19 you are better at 20. When are 30 you are worse at 31, it's as simple as that,\" he said, with tongue not entirely removed from cheek.</p> <p>\"Look at my team today,\" he added. \"Denilson is 20, [Cesc] F\u00e1bregas is 21, [Alexandre] Song is 21, [Theo] Walcott is 19, Bendtner is 20. When you have players of that age and can still fight for the championship then it bodes well. You hope the year after they will be even better.</p> <p>\"What I like about this team is that they have a good attitude and share the same vision and express themselves well. We want to win first of all but, if it's possible, we want to win with style. We are a lot more robust than people think we are, we have shown that.\"</p> <p>He was echoed by F\u00e1bregas who said: \"We showed great character and if you are going to win the league you have to win these games. We don't want to stop here. We want to keep going.\" </p> <p>Nevertheless, the feeling persists that Arsenal still lack the sort of tough-tackling holding player that would put some bite into their midfield. Come the tiring pitches of winter, there is a real danger that their vibrant passing game will not be enough to see them through. Presumably Wenger suspects the same, which would explain why he was considering moves for Aston Villa's Gareth Barry or Liverpool's Xabi Alonso over the summer.</p> <p>In the absence of such, it was left to Bendtner to provide the bite. Having been stung into action by Kevin Davies' early headed goal, Arsenal gave notice of their intent when Bendtner sent through Adebayor who hit the post when he should have scored. Song then headed against the other post before Arsenal took the lead when Bendtner's flick was eased on by Adebayor and Emmanuel Ebou\u00e9 bagged his first league goal.</p> <p>Bendtner immediately slid in a second from Denilson's cross and Bolton were lucky not to concede more as Arsenal staged an exhibition match around the edge of their penalty area: \"a cakewalk,\" was how the Bolton manager, Gary Megson, described it. The home side fought back in the second half and were perhaps unlucky to concede a third at the end when the substitute Theo Walcott left six players floundering for Adebayor to set up Denilson, but they could hardly argue, with Arsenal enjoying 71% of possession.</p> <p>It was a pity Setanta implied a 45th-minute challenge from Davies that ended Ga\u00ebl Clichy's interest had been anything other than robust. An x-ray revealed Clichy had a bruised shin. Perhaps Wenger might want to consider why his full-back came out worse off in a tackle with a striker.</p> <p><strong>Man of the match</strong> Nicklas Bendtner<br>His movement, vision and deft first touch made him virtually unmarkable</p> <p><strong>Best moment</strong> His perfect through-ball to Emmanuel Adebayor in the 21st minute which his fellow striker did not have to control and should have scored from</p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown says he wants to \"clean up the City\" (Report, September 19). Yet again his actions inspire no confidence that he will address the seriousness with as much ruthlessness as it might require. Mr Brown's economic prowess evaporated with his 10p tax fiasco. </p> <p>The seeds of the current economic doom were clearly sown in Margaret Thatcher's time with the abolition of many regulations which had previously kept misbehaviour in check. It seems to be forgotten that many regulations were introduced precisely because of problems which have arisen. The economic catastrophe sucks the Labour party with it because it failed to redress Thatcher's unbalancing act in their first 10 years of office, most of the time when Brown was in a position to do so. The Halifax Building Society, founded in 1853, survived for longer than 100 years through prudence, but lasted only a decade after Thatcher's relaxing of the rules.</p> <p>Labour has a chance to address the situation. But will it now implement the changes people have been calling for over the last few years? Tax the rich for their fair contribution, stop the privatisation of the NHS, cease to allow any private industry access to personal details, stop post office closures, restore energy policy and utilities to national ownership, speed up the introduction of renewables ... the list goes on. This would be a dramatic action: to listen to the people instead of City dwellers. Don't hold your breath.<br><strong>JN Ellis</strong><br>Tavistock, Devon </p> <p>The government has a chance this week to tackle housing need, meet its own target and show it's listening (Government 'must step in' to hit deadline for 3m homes, September 19), but that depends on it dropping the dogma and investing in first-class council housing.</p> <p>Three consecutive Labour party conferences have voted for the \"fourth option\" of direct investment in council housing to enable local authorities to improve existing homes and estates and start building a new generation of first-class council homes. </p> <p>The case is stronger than ever, as private developers and lenders have all but shut up shop. Housing associations, while taking billions in public subsidies, have had their chance and failed to deliver too. Through a process of mergers and takeovers, the third sector is morphing into a few multibillion-pound businesses that are less and less accountable but, of course, paying ever-higher salaries to senior managers.</p> <p>If the public is going to put subsidies into housing then it makes sense for the outcome to be publicly owned. </p> <p>The Local Government Association predicts that council housing waiting lists, now at 1.67 million households, will rise to 2 million (5 million people) by 2010. Massive investment in first-class council housing, providing secure tenancies, low rents and an elected landlord that can be held to account, offers the only practical solution to housing need.<br><strong>Alan Walter</strong><br>Chair, Defend Council Housing </p> <p>Politicians and journalists are forever moaning about lack of public participation in the political process. Yet when I turn on BBC News 24 to see coverage of the substantial protest I know to be occurring outside the Labour conference, I find it's omitted and edited out of public consciousness. The massive \"steel fortress\" - reminiscent of second world war anti-tank emplacements - erected around the city centre is also omitted from coverage. Instead we get coverage of PR stunts - including JK Rowling's \u00a31m donation to the Labour party and the 20 MPs who have signed a letter of support for the PM. So the voices of 21 privileged individuals are elevated over those of the many thousands of grassroots Labour supporters proclaiming that this is no longer our party. This a sorry excuse for journalism and democracy.<br><strong>Gavin Lewis</strong><br>Manchester </p> <p>Polly Toynbee states that \"Brown is not a famous eater of his own mantras\" (As the storms roll in Brown is left politically naked, September 16). I would beg to differ. A reading of Gordon Brown's book Where There is Greed, published in 1989, would tend to suggest that he has done just that. For example, in the chapter Privatisation: Who Benefits? he states: \"Privatisation has been a costly experiment whose benefits have been at best dubious ... the losers have been the taxpayers, the winners undoubtedly the big institutions in the City and top management of the privatised companies.\"</p> <p>In the chapter on Unequal Britain: How the Rich Became Richer he queries: \"How is it that incentives for rich and poor are so very different? How can it be that for the rich the only stimulus to economic endeavour is that the rewards become increasingly lavish, while the poor are in continual need of the spur of their poverty?\"</p> <p>I could go on, but my post has just arrived. It contains an advice of payment on my teacher's pension, demonstrating absolutely clearly that I will pay \u00a350 per month more tax from October. I agree absolutely with Polly's comment that Gordon Brown is \"left politically naked, with the 10p tax fiasco being the most deadly factor of all\".<br><strong>Maggie Pearse</strong><br>Shipley, West Yorkshire</p> <p>Professor Anne Watson (Letters, September 20) identifies two policies - tax relief to the lowest-paid and spending taxpayers' money on new social housing - that she thinks could be described as socialism. These two policies are already espoused by the Liberal Democrats, who are often described as rightward-leaning. </p> <p>Meanwhile Gordon Brown takes the credit (Fairness is still our guide, September 20) for nationalising Northern Rock, a policy he and Alistair Darling resisted when it was suggested by Vince Cable, until they finally recognised that the Liberal Democrat shadow chancellor was right.

  "<p>Gianfranco Zola's priority at Upton Park is to produce not so much a winning team as a team with a winning smile to match his own. West Ham had just won two successive games 4-1 when Alan Curbishley resigned on a point of principle about managerial control of transfers but his sides tended to wear a worried frown. Curbishley's pragmatic approach served Charlton faithfully for years but did not always go down well north of the Thames.</p> <p>After Zola's new charges had beaten Newcastle on Saturday Carlton Cole, who had played a few games alongside the little Italian at Chelsea, confessed to his arrival being \"a bit of a culture shock.\" Certainly West Ham performed with a new sense of freedom although whether this was down to Zola or the generous amount of time and space they were allowed by the opposition was hard to tell; probably a bit of both.</p> <p>Either way, feelings of an Italian renaissance were strengthened by the fact that David Di Michele, a striker on loan from Torino, scored West Ham's first two goals and set up the third for Matthew Etherington. Di Michele is one of those fluttering footballers who are inclined to enthral one moment and infuriate the next. West Ham know the type. They had one not so long ago. Name of Paolo Di Canio. Yet if Di Michele was apt to overdo the feints and dragovers his was an alert attacking presence in the absence of Dean Ashton and Craig Bellamy. </p> <p>Di Michele's opening goal, after eight minutes, was aided by deflections off David Edgar and Steven Taylor which took the ball over Shay Given in a high loop. The second, eight minutes before half-time, owed much to the speed of his reaction after Given had blocked his first shot along with dull defending. First Taylor lunged in blindly, giving Di Michele an opportunity to turn past the challenge, flicking the ball with him as he did so. Fabricio Coloccini then turned his back as the forward prepared to shoot when he could have blocked the drive which beat Given at the near post.</p> <p>The low centre with which Di Michele set up Etherington to score eight minutes after half-time looked as if it might have been a miscued attempt at a shot but the Italian had done enough to earn the crowd's approval, although Cole's selfless running and willingness to take on defenders in batches were equally crucial to West Ham's victory.</p> <p>Zola was careful to mention this amid his praise for the win, the team, the performance, the crowd and life in general. \"Cole was occasionally up against two defenders today and he was unbelievable.\" he said. \"He started playing with me when I was at Chelsea and I feel he can become much better. There are things he can improve on but he has all the qualities to play for the national team.\" </p> <p>Of Di Michele he said: \"I wish he can do as well as [Paolo] Di Canio did, for these supporters. He has got everything in his bag to be a successful player for West Ham. We want players to become important for the club and successful. I told him he can do unbelievable things but he needs to improve his finishing - which after Saturday shows he listens to me.\" </p> <p>Fabio Capello, the England coach, was watching on Saturday although the presence of his physio, Gary Lewin, alongside him suggested he was there more to check on the match fitness of Michael Owen.</p> <p>The Newcastle striker obliged Capello with a well-taken goal just past the hour, side-stepping Lucas Neill before curling in a shot at the far post. Otherwise he still looked a fraction short, missing several chances that the old Owen would have taken without blinking.</p> <p>It was Zola's good fortune to enter Premier League management against Newcastle in their present plight: a rudderless hulk showing an early drift towards the reef of relegation and now in the bottom three. Their owner, Mike Ashley, wants to sell up and has been hoping for a buyer from the Middle East. </p> <p>On Saturday's evidence, however, it would be hard to swap Newcastle United for a set of dodgy postcards in a Cairo back street.</p> <p><strong>Man of the match</strong> David Di Michele (West Ham United)</p>",
  "<p>It is difficult to believe that Martin O'Neill has experienced a more satisfying week as Aston Villa manager. There was little comfort to be found in a schedule that demanded Villa visit White Hart Lane, Bulgaria and West Bromwich Albion within the space of seven days but victories on each occasion have made light of the workload. It was an achievement that appeared uppermost in O'Neill's mind as he headed for the travelling supporters rather than the tunnel at the final whistle to celebrate another three-point haul.</p> <p>Never one to try to hide his emotions, O'Neill punched the air with delight after Villa maintained their hex over Albion, stretching their unbeaten record against their West Midlands neighbours to 15 matches spanning more than 22 years. It was a sequence that never looked like being threatened when Villa scored twice in the space of two minutes just before the half-hour mark. James Morrison's goal seven minutes later revived Albion's hopes but there was already a sense that the damage had been done.</p> <p>With pre-match events conspiring against Tony Mowbray, the Albion manager, found defeat difficult to accept. Abdoulaye M\u00e9\u00eft\u00e9 had been expected to start in central defence but the Ivorian broke down with an ankle injury in the warm-up and the consequences for Albion proved to be severe. Leon Barnett, M\u00e9\u00eft\u00e9's replacement, was culpable for both Villa goals and generally looked like someone who was struggling to come to terms with the idea that he was playing after initially being told he would be dropped.</p> <p>Villa, in John Carew and Gabriel Agbonlahor, had the attacking personnel to capitalise on Albion's shortcomings. Absent from the trip to Litex Lovech in the Uefa Cup on Thursday night, Carew was a constant menace to the Albion defence as he headed his fourth goal of the season and also struck the post twice. \"I wouldn't swap him for anyone at the moment - except Pele,\" said Agbonlahor, who was perhaps a little overexcited after seizing his first goal since an opening-day hat-trick against Manchester City at Villa Park.</p> <p>\"The momentum is terrific,\" said O'Neill. \"Monday night was magnificent. We looked stodgy in the first half in Bulgaria but we were back playing in the Premiership today and, although we took a bit of time to get back into the game, we came into it with a vengeance. West Brom started very well. But our two-goal spurt in a moment or two was a big setback for them and a big confidence boost for us. We missed a couple of chances in the second half but I thought we deserved to win.\"</p> <p>While it was hard to disagree with that assessment, Mowbray was also entitled to claim that \"there wasn't a lot between the two teams\". That much was certainly true in the midfield department, where Jonathan Greening, Robert Koren and Borja Valero were in control for a period, but both up front and in central defence Villa were more much convincing, with Curtis Davies, booed throughout against his former club, and Martin Laursen enjoying a comfortable afternoon compared with the hapless Barnett and Jonas Olsson.</p> <p>\"I can't criticise the effort and the desire and, at times the quality, but there was some very poor defending and if you defend like that you are going to lose games,\" said Mowbray who, as a former centre-half, must have been watching through his fingers at times. \"It's been an achilles heel for a few years for us and we have got to eradicate it. It was disappointing that M\u00e9\u00eft\u00e9 got injured in the warm-up. It would be easy for me to say that if he hadn't got injured the goals hadn't happened, but you have got to have your quality on the pitch.\" </p> <p>Barnett's first blunder came when he allowed Carew to escape following Ashley Young's free-kick, the Norwegian sending a powerful header in off the near upright after earlier spurning a similar chance. Less than two minutes later Villa doubled their lead when Barnett intercepted Young's pass but inexplicably gifted possession to Agbonlahor. The invitation was too good to turn down, with Agbonlahor tearing clear before drilling an angled shot through Olsson's legs and across Scott Carson into the bottom corner.</p> <p>Albion's response was swift, and also aided by an error, when Brad Friedel spilled Koren's speculative shot and Morrison, reacting quicker than Nicky Shorey to the loose ball, prodded home from close range. Friedel, to his credit, atoned for that mistake on the stroke of half-time, when he produced a superb one-handed save to deny Kim Do-heon, but thereafter it was Villa, and in particular Carew, who struck the upright twice in as many second-half minutes, who always looked the more likely to score again.</p> <p><strong>Man of the match</strong> John Carew</p> <p>What the Norwegian lacks in mobility he more than makes up for with his aerial presence. Carew troubled the Albion rearguard throughout and, but for the width of the post, might have scored a hat-trick</p> <p><strong>Best moment</strong> The towering header he directed past Scott Carson and in off the upright after giving Leon Barnett the slip</p>",
  "<p>Democracy involves much more than throwing the old (white) rascals out. Democracy depends on what comes next - on the growth of a settled system that means governments can change amid constitutional calm. India long ago reached that point. Compare and contrast Zimbabwe. And, meanwhile, fear for South Africa. </p> <p>The ousting of Thabo Mbeki isn't some sudden convulsion. He was on his way out anyway. But the manner of his dispatch is altogether more menacing. A president made to pay for dirty dealing? It can be made to sound like some heroic African Watergate. But there's nothing heroic about the fratricide that grips the African National Congress now. It isn't just a case of who comes after Mbeki. We know that: Jacob Zuma. The real problem is what he brings with him.</p> <p>Not so long ago, Zuma was Mbeki's creature. Mbeki made him vice-president in 1999 not because he was qualified to succeed him but because he wasn't: no great intellect, no credibility, no threat. But, for a clever man, Mbeki is also incredibly stupid. He's remote, withdrawn, a chill control freak. So he left Zuma to do the meeting and greeting, the tub-thumping for true party believers, the link role in parliament. He turned his own puppet into a threat - and, when Zuma sank into a mire of corruption allegations, he slyly sought to push him under.</p> <p>It's those malign manoeuvres that a high court judge condemned last week, handing Mbeki's enemies on the ANC executive the chance to dump him. So now South Africa prepares for a turbulent hiatus before next year's elections give Zuma a seat in parliament and the presidency proper. In the short term, the problem is keeping enough cabinet heavy-hitters on board to avoid economic panic. In the long term, extreme apprehension - to give panic its posher name - may be simply unavoidable. </p> <p>For while Mbeki was wrong to try to ditch Zuma by twisting the law, he may also have been absolutely right: this succession is a disaster already happening. Can a President Zuma hold together the tribes, tongues and furious factions of the ANC? See growth, at 4% a year, keep pounding forward through a global credit crunch? Begin at last to trickle down wealth to the townships and villages? Or cut a crime rate that is bringing South Africa to its knees? </p> <p>The big question was always, \"After Mbeki, who?\" (A dusty book title on my highest shelf inquires plangently: After Nehru, Who?) And the ANC has at least four candidates. The difficulty - and the cause for fear - is that it hasn't the wit to offer any of them for office. Mbeki thought he could finish his two terms as president but get re-elected as ANC leader, a variant of the Putin gambit in which he succeeded himself. Bad thinking, and humiliation as Zuma won. But now, in what is still effectively a one-party state, the party apparatus drives Mbeki from government. The caucus still rules OK. The ultimate control freaks are calling the shots. </p> <p>It's too easy to set timbers shivering over Mbeki's HIV/Aids idiocies or Zuma's claim that he was fine sleeping with an HIV-positive woman because he took a shower afterwards: that's the stuff of cartoon tragedy. But there's a far direr challenge here. Without South Africa, there can be no \"African Renaissance\", no building of hope, no prospect of progress to erase the scars of Zimbabwe. And without the cleansing of settled democracy, change at the ballot box sweeping the new old rascals out, there's no true chance of that happening. </p> <p>Could a credible ANC loyalist - a Ramaphosa say - break ranks and challenge Zuma next year at an open election? \"Loyalty\" to the liberation still seems to rule that out. If so, the next big bad book writes itself. The one called After Mbeki, What?</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:p.preston@theguardian.com\">p.preston@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama is to head to Tampa, Florida, this week to spend three days preparing for the first of his three presidential debates with the Republican candidate, John McCain. The Democratic presidential candidate will conduct intensive rehearsals at a so-called debates camp, which includes a mock-up of the stage on which the debate will take place at the University of Mississippi on Friday. One of his advisers, Greg Craig, will stand in for McCain.</p> <p>The run-up to the first televised clash increases the tempo of a campaign that is already breaking all records. Funding figures released late on Saturday showed the two sides each spending an average of $3m a day.</p> <p>The format of the debates was released at the weekend after negotiations between the two camps and the neutral presidential debates commission. In contrast with a relatively free-wheeling format agreed by Obama and McCain, the Republican team won a series of restrictions to help McCain's running mate, Sarah Palin, in her vice-presidential debate with Obama's running mate, Joe Biden, in St Louis the following week, the biggest challenge she faces in the entire election.</p> <p>McCain's team is worried that Palin might be exposed by her lack of foreign policy experience. The team managed to insert time limits on topics for the debate. Time for her cross-examination by Biden, chairman of the Senate foreign affairs committee, has also been shortened. </p> <p>Although the campaign teams have been publicly focused on Wall Street, they have been gearing up behind the scenes for debates that could determine the outcome of the November 4 election. Many independent voters, who make up about 25% of the electorate, will only finally make their choice based on the performances in the debates.</p> <p>McCain and Obama have been rehearsing questions and answers with members of their campaign teams while flying about the country. Craig, Obama's sparring partner lined up for Tampa, was a stand-in for President George Bush while John Kerry prepared for the 2004 debates.</p> <p>While the presidential debates are potentially decisive, a poor showing by Palin in the sole vice-presidential one would resurrect doubts again about McCain's judgement in choosing her.</p> <p>Palin, on a crash course in foreign policy, is to meet foreign leaders in New York at the UN general assembly this week. Among those being lined up are Hamid Karzai, the Afghanistan president, and Alvaro Uribe, the Colombian president. She is also pencilled in to meet the former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger.</p> <p>Obama, seeing the polls shift slightly towards him as a result of the economic upheaval, was campaigning in North Carolina yesterday. He has accused McCain of \"panicking\" in the face of Wall Street events and has been reminding voters at every turn that McCain had long advocated deregulating Wall Street, blamed for the crisis. McCain replied that Obama was engaging in scare tactics. </p> <p>The two sides are so equally balanced in the polls that even a slight edge may decide the election outcome, and their spending reflects that.</p> <p>The campaign teams, as required by law, had to release a detailed breakdown of their spending for August by midnight on Saturday. This showed that the two teams spent $94.5m last month: $53.5m for Obama and $41m for McCain.</p> <p>The payrolls of both teams has jumped as more campaign staff have been recruited for the final election phase - $1.2m by McCain and $2.8m by Obama, but most of the spending was on advertising, concentrated in about a dozen battlefield states. McCain blew about $23m on advertising and Obama $33m. Obama spent $4.9m on travel to McCain's $3m.</p> <p>Despite the astonishing success of Obama's fundraising team in bringing in millions from small donors that has left him with $77m in the bank even after the record spending, McCain is well placed to match him. While Obama has been raising more than McCain, the Republican party's coffers are vast, with $76m, while the Democratic party is less well off, with $17m.</p> <p>The figures revealed the failed candidate for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton, is still burdened with $9m from her campaign.</p>",
  "<p>A leading fund manager and owner of a substantial Scottish grouse moor has been hit by the largest ever financial penalty under farming legislation after police found highly toxic and illegal pesticides on his estate.</p> <p>John Dodd, the multimillionaire owner of the Glenogil shooting estate, in Angus, Tayside, has had his farming subsidy cut by \u00a3107,000 by the Scottish executive because of suspicions that the discovered pesticides were used against birds of prey on his land.</p> <p>Dodd is the co-founder of the Edinburgh-based Artemis investment bank and hedge fund, which this summer sponsored the Scottish Game Fair, the Game and Wildlife Conservation Trust's prestigious annual country sports show.</p> <p>There has been a series of suspected cases of illegal persecution of rare birds of prey on the Glenogil estate but none has led to a successful prosecution. An investigation by the Guardian found that lethal pesticides were discovered on poisoned baits, game bags and soil and plant samples in 2006.</p> <p>Investigators from the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds found an illegal compound - a combination of carbofuran and isofenphos pesticides that has never been licensed for use in the UK - on a dead rabbit staked out on a hillside close to Glenogil in April 2006. That led to a raid organised by Tayside police involving 80 officers from several forces, alongside investigators from the RSPB and officials from the rural payments division of the Scottish executive.</p> <p>The police raid uncovered the same combination of pesticides on a dead pigeon laid out as bait on the estate, on game bags used by estate staff, and in soil and plant samples. A member of the Glenogil staff was sued after an illegal trap was discovered, but the case was later dropped by the prosecutors.</p> <p>As a direct result of these investigations, officials in the rural payments division of the Scottish executive in Edinburgh last month docked Dodd's large farming subsidies for 2006 by \u00a3107,650. </p> <p>It is the largest ever civil penalty imposed under strict EU \"cross-compliance\" legislation, which makes protection of wildlife a condition of the subsidy. </p> <p>These regulations make it an offence to have illegal pesticides such as carbofuran on the land, or commit offences against birds of prey including the use of illegal traps or poisons. </p> <p>The Wildlife and Countryside Act makes it a criminal offence - punishable by a six-month jail term and/or a \u00a35,000 fine - to kill or attempt to kill a bird of prey. Pesticide control regulations carry the same penalties for storing or using banned or unlicensed pesticides, such as carborfuran and isofenphos.</p> <p>The largest fine imposed by a court for a wildlife crime so far in the UK was the \u00a3125,000 imposed last year on a Malaysian man for illegally importing rare and endangered orchids. </p> <p>Glenogil was last year also implicated in the disappearance of a rare sea eagle, one of 15 birds that had just been released into the wild in eastern Scotland under a government-sponsored reintroduction programme. Witnesses suggest the bird may have been killed on the estate but the allegation remains unproven: neither the bird's body nor its satellite tag has been found. </p> <p>Dodd threatened Tayside police with legal action after the force issued an appeal for information that implicated the estate. The 47-year-old has insisted his staff are innocent. </p> <p>Over the past three years Dodd had received \u00a3829,664 in single farm payment subsidies for his farm at Glenogil. It is understood that Dodd, who is the third landowner in Scotland to have subsidies cut under the regulations, is contesting the Scottish executive's decision. He denies that there has been persecution of birds of prey on his estate but would not comment on the Scottish executive's penalties against his estate. </p> <p>The same illegal poisonous compound - which was withdrawn from sale as an insecticide in Ireland five years ago because of its toxicity - was also found on another grouse moor, the Leadhills estate, in southwest Scotland in the autumn of 2005. The estate, near Abingdon, was run at the time by Mark Osborne, one of the UK's most successful managers of moor shoots. Osborne runs estates and advises shooting moor owners across Scotland and northern England, including Glenogil. Four of those estates - Leadhills, Glenogil, plus Glenlochy on Speyside and Snilesworth, north Yorkshire - have been raided in the past two years by police investigating claims of birds of prey persecution. </p> <p>At the Snilesworth estate, near Northallerton, a head-keeper and two game keepers admitted illegally using traps baited with pigeons to catch protected birds of prey. The head-keeper was fined \u00a31,250. A keeper at Leadhills was convicted of shooting a short-eared owl in 2004 and fined \u00a3500; Osborne refused to comment yesterday.</p> <p>Dodd, the co-founder of the Artemis investment bank, which markets itself as \"the profit hunter\" and uses cartoons of hunters with shotguns and gundogs in its advertising, has become an influential figure in the Scottish shooting world and the local community since 2003 when he bought his 3,913-hectare (9,670-acre) estate for \u00a34.5m. Last month, Artemis was the chief sponsor for the annual Scottish game fair held at Scone palace, near Perth, 45 miles away from Glenogil. The fair was run by the Game and Wildlife Conservation Trust, (formerly the Game Conservancy Trust) which backs \"good shooting practice\" and sponsors research into game management.</p>",
  "<p>Way back in the mists of time, there was a Labour prime minister who said that a week is a long time in politics. As he prepares for his conference speech tomorrow, Gordon Brown knows exactly what Harold Wilson meant.</p> <p>Seven days ago, Brown was living on borrowed time. His authority almost visibly draining away, the prime minister faced a rebellious faction in his party growing stronger and more vociferous by the day. A week of mayhem in the financial markets has turned the dynamics of last year's Labour conference on its head. Last autumn, Brown blew what had looked like an unassailable political position; this year only an unimaginably inept performance will result in him failing to leave Manchester stronger.</p> <p>That is not because the objective facts have changed much, if at all. The economy is still in an absolutely dire state and will get much worse over the winter. Unemployment is rising rapidly as the big sources of job growth in recent years - financial services, construction and retailing - all suffer. By Christmas, it is likely that the claimant count measure of unemployment will be rising by 50,000 a month. Consumer confidence is at record lows in the face of falling house prices, higher inflation and weak real income growth; it is hard to believe that the traumatic events last week will lift the mood of deep apprehension. Indeed, it is probable that the emergency action to save HBOS, Britain's biggest mortgage lender, will make consumers even less likely to part with their cash, and since consumer spending accounts for about 70% of gross domestic product, the chances of 2009 being the first calendar year of falling output since 1991 are high.</p> <p>None of this is news to Brown or Alistair Darling. Each month, the Treasury releases figures showing the consensus forecasts of economists from the City, independent research bodies and employers' organisations. In July, their expectation was for growth of 1.1% in 2009. This month, the consensus is for 0.3% - and that looks optimistic.</p> <p>All of which illustrates Brown's folly in postponing the election last year, when he was still in his honeymoon phase and the economy had yet to be affected by the double whammy of the credit crunch and rocketing commodity prices. You didn't need to be an economic genius to work out in the autumn of 2007 that this was as good as it got for Labour. </p> <p>Brown sometimes resembles a tragic hero in a Hardy novel: an essentially good man brought down by one error of judgment. If his premiership does end disastrously, the election that never was will be the equivalent of the future Mayor of Casterbridge auctioning his wife for five guineas.</p> <p><strong>Wild excesses</strong></p> <p>Yesterday's poll in the Observer is an indication of the challenge that faces Labour - one made immensely more difficult not just by the state of the economy but by the fact that it was Brown who ran the show in his decade as chancellor and during that time did nothing to curb the wild excesses of the financial markets. On the contrary, London was actively marketed as the place where firms could sail close to the wind. The Conservatives were quick to say last week that the regulatory structure that failed so abysmally was put in place by Brown and Darling after Labour took power in 1997. Clearly, if there were an election now, David Cameron would win it by a landslide.</p> <p>Yet, the financial crisis has exposed big problems for the Opposition. The first is that financial deregulation has always been the agenda of the free-market right. Traditionally, it has been social democrats who have argued for monitoring markets, especially financial ones, and circumscribing their freedom by controls and regulations. Brown promised on Saturday he would do \"whatever it takes\" to clean up the City and while voters may take some convincing of that, given that such reforming zeal has lain dormant for the past 11 years, the same pledge would be meaningless from the Tories. Labour will play this card at every opportunity this week, contrasting the government's new-found willingness to rein in the speculators with the Conservative's fetish for free markets.</p> <p>Unusually, Cameron is going to have his policies held up to the light.</p> <p>The second problem the Opposition leader has is that his entire sales pitch relies on being in a position as prime minister to spend money. As one shadow cabinet minister put it last week: \"Dave is a politician for the good times but if we win the next election we will be faced with an economic problem that will take an entire parliament to clear up. It will be like Margaret Thatcher in 1979.\" Cameron, of course, is not marketing himself as the son of Thatcher but as the heir to Blair.</p> <p>Brown's strategy, therefore, is to depict Cameron as a frivolous, free-market lightweight at a time when the global crisis requires a serious reformer. So far, this approach has been a spectacular failure, but the sheer scale of the financial crisis and its inevitable knock-on effects on the economy now make it more plausible.</p> <p>By taking the fight to the Tories, Brown also leaves himself less exposed to dissenters within his own party. There were still those yesterday calling for a leadership challenge but the events of the past week have given the prime minister breathing space. In part, that's down to luck - plotting looks petty when the global financial system is close to meltdown, as it was last Thursday. In part, though, Brown and Darling made their own luck through effective crisis management. It was right to ride roughshod over competition law to permit the merger of Lloyds TSB and HBOS, and it was right to announce the moratorium on short-selling bank stock.</p> <p>Moreover, it is hard to see how a new leader, with an equally inexperienced chancellor, would improve the survival chances of Labour backbenchers. </p> <p>Even in normal times, markets do not respond well to a vacuum. Ousting Brown would lead to a catastrophic run on the pound that would force the Bank of England either to leave interest rates on hold or, more probably, to raise them. That is precisely what the economy does not need at the moment. </p> <p>There is an overwhelming case for the Bank of England to cut borrowing costs - not to re-inflate the credit bubble (we are a long, long way beyond that) but to help businesses with their cash flow and to provide cash-strapped consumers with a bit more disposable income. Anything that delays that process - as removing Brown and Darling would - runs the risk of driving the economy into an even more serious downturn.</p> <p>None of which means that Brown is secure. Even in the best-case scenario for Labour, the economy will go through a difficult winter before starting to emerge from recession in the second half of 2009. The short-term news on the economy will be dire, and that will be reflected in the opinion polls.</p> <p>But, just like the financial markets, it is hard to see how things could get worse for the prime minister than they were last week. They may bump along the bottom for a while, but shares in Brown now look cheap.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:larry.elliott@theguardian.com\">larry.elliott@theguardian.com</a></p>",

  "<p>Kerb-crawling and soliciting for prostitutes on the streets are to be outlawed as part of a wide-ranging tightening of the law, the home secretary, Jacqui Smith, annnounced yesterday.</p> <p>Warning of the \"blight\" of prostitution, Smith outlined a three-point plan at the Labour conference that will:</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Remove the requirement that only persistent kerb crawlers and men who solicit on the street can be prosecuted. An alternative requirement for kerb-crawlers - that they act \"in a manner that is likely to cause annoyance to people in the neighbourhood\" - is also to be removed. The changes will mean that kerb-crawlers and men soliciting sex on the street can be prosecuted after a first offence.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Give new powers to councils and the police to close down brothels for at least three months if prostitutes are being run by a pimp or have been trafficked. At the moment, police can only close brothels if there is anti-social behaviour and if Class-A drugs are involved.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Change the law so that men can be prosecuted if they pay for sex with women who are exploited - \"controlled for another person's gain\", as Smith said. Currently, police can only pursue a prosecution if they can prove that the women did not consent to sex, which means they have to compile evidence of rape.</p> <p>The home secretary also announced that communities will be given more say in lap-dancing clubs opening in their areas. Smith criticised the Tories for sending delegates to their conference in Birmingham next week a \u00a310 voucher to visit such a club. \"I want to know what the Tories have to say for themselves,\" she said.</p> <p>Smith announced the new measures on prostitution after a six-month government review into prostitution that focused on how Sweden and the Netherlands deal with the problem.</p> <p>\"We will do more to tackle the blight of street prostitution,\" Smith told the Labour conference in Manchester. \"At the moment only persistent kerb-crawling is outlawed. In my book, once around the block is once too many - and so we'll make kerb-crawling punishable as a first offence.\"</p> <p>The government will also toughen the law to prosecute men who pay for sex with women who are run by a pimp or who have been trafficked. Harriet Harman, Labour's deputy leader who is also equality minister, said: \"We must protect women from being victims of human trafficking - the modern slave trade. The trade only exists because men buy sex, so to protect women we must stop men buying sex from the victims of human trafficking.\"</p> <p>Labour focused the first full day of its conference on crime and the law. Jack Straw, the justice secretary, announced a crackdown on \"no win, no fee\" lawyers, who have ramped up their fees in recent years, and on legal aid solicitors.</p> <p>\"I am concerned about 'no win, no fee' arrangements,\" Straw said. \"It's claimed they have provided greater access to justice but the behaviour of some lawyers in ramping up their fees in these cases is nothing short of scandalous.\"</p> <p>Turning his attention to legal aid lawyers - more money is spent on legal aid in England and Wales than anywhere else in the world - Straw said: \"There are now three times as many lawyers in private practice but paid for by the taxpayer as there were three decades ago; the budget has grown faster than the health and education services.</p> <p>\"The challenge now is how better to spend these huge sums in the interests of justice; something I want to do with the legal profession and local government.\"</p> <p>Straw's crackdown on lawyers is part of a campaign to open up the justice system as he strives to lift the \"veil\" on justice. \"It's about a change of culture, of attitude, about lifting the veil which sometimes keeps justice from view,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>'Next time you come, it will be better, God willing,\" says Yasser Herbawi, the 76-year-old owner of the first and only Palestinian keffiyeh factory. It's hard to see how. Last year, the distinctive black-and-white checked scarves became a surprise global trend, knotted around the necks of the most fashion-savvy. At the same time, the family-run company that produces this symbol of the Palestinian national struggle has been slowly grinding to a halt. </p> <p>\"It's the Chinese imports,\" explains Yasser, sitting amid piles of keffiyehs at the Herbawi factory storeroom, just outside Hebron in the West Bank. \"In the 70s we could barely keep up with demand, but by the mid-90s cheap Chinese scarves started coming in, because of globalisation and Gatt.\" Yasser's sons Abdel Atheem, 50, and Judeh, 43, nod in agreement and curse the trade tariff-busting agreement. \"We were forced to lower our prices and today we are working to a fraction of our capacity because we cannot compete.\" The factory used to produce more than 1,000 scarves a day, but now makes less than 100 - and struggles to sell those. A shutdown seems almost inevitable. </p> <p>Needless to say, the Herbawi family isn't much enamoured with the cheap imports that first swamped and then stole their market. \"They are not the same quality,\" says Yasser as he picks up a keffiyeh and spreads it across his knees, reverently feeling the light, dimpled cotton between his fingers. \"Our product is better, much better. We take care of it and use only natural products, and it is beautiful.\" This textiles factory, which Yasser started 40 years ago, supplied the entire West Bank and Gaza - orders for scarves, robes and jackets, all fashioned from the same check, would also arrive from neighbouring Arab countries. Of course, the company creates much more than a specific cotton weave. \"We are making the symbol of Palestine,\" says Yasser. \"This scarf is the history and the heritage of our country.\" </p> <p>The black-and-white square keffiyeh is Syrian in origin and is the head garment of choice for traditional, rural Arab males of a certain age. It was the 1930s Arab revolt against the British Mandate and Zionist organisations in Palestine that first established the scarf as a resistance symbol: it was worn in solidarity, and to make it difficult for the authorities to weed out orchestrators of the rural-led uprising. By the 60s, the scarf became emblematic of the nascent Palestinian national movement - it was the favoured headwear of the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and habitually worn by other symbols of the Palestinian resistance such as Leila Khaled. Then a red-and-white Jordanian version surfaced, taken up by Palestinian Marxists to differentiate themselves within the wider nationalist movement. More recently, its meaning changed again: \"The Marxists in Palestine have all but disappeared and the ones who replaced them are the Islamists,\" explains Dr Samir Awad, political scientist at the West Bank's Bir Zeit university. \"Now it's the Hamas guys who put on the red-and-white, just because they don't want to be associated with Fatah.\" </p> <p>Around the Middle East, traditional, rural Arab men do still wear the keffiyeh, in the traditional way - as a headpiece, with the aqal ring holding it in place. But Awad says that these days, it is less widely used as a neckwear nationalist emblem by the younger generation of Palestinians. He provides one possible explanation: \"The image of the keffiyeh as a symbol of resistance was tarnished by events in Afghanistan and Iraq, where it is used by terrorists, by anyone who wants to hide their face,\" he says. \"It is very annoying, but there is no monopoly on the keffiyeh.\" The common appearance of the keffiyeh in suicide bomber videos has doubtless caused the two concepts to fuse in the minds of some observers.</p> <p>For some years now, the keffiyeh has carried activist-chic credentials for anti-war protesters and supporters of the Palestinian cause across several continents. But it is more recently that the scarves have gained their full fashion stripes. \"We noticed club kids were wearing them about a year and a half ago,\" says Melanie Rickey, fashion news director at Grazia magazine. \"They were dyeing them fluorescent colours, and it was seen as a bit risque.\" Picking up on the trend, Balenciaga brought out a designer keffiyeh last summer. \"What did they do, smother it with gold?\" asks Abdel Atheem at the Herbawi factory when he hears of its \u00a33,000 price tag. \"If I tried to sell the scarves for \u00a310, nobody would listen,\" says Yasser of the product, which gets a local market price of around \u00a33. \"And ours is the real thing.\"</p> <p>The designer endorsement was a bit like the Midas touch - high street stores such as Topshop and American Apparel were soon churning out \"black-and-white woven cotton\" scarves for roughly the same sum that Yasser laments would cause his customers to turn a deaf ear. \"After a while people just thought, 'These are nice scarves,'\" says Rickey, \"so that by this time last year, every teenage girl from London to Scotland had one.\" The keffiyeh as fashion item might now be on the wane, but Rickey thinks that the popular neckpiece started a paradigm-shifting trend - a retailer's dream scenario: it took the scarf out of a winter-wardrobe context and into the realm of all-year-round accessory. \"The fastest selling accessory is the summer scarf,\" she explains. \"Stores such as Oasis carry 30 to 40 different patterns - customers just can't get enough of them.\" </p> <p>The high street has moved on from the black-and-white weave; Rickey says the current hot stock is glitter-thread-shot hippy scarves. Such faddishness is what makes it tough to interpret the craze for keffiyehs as ideological expression or act of Palestinian solidarity - in fact, fashion scarf-wearers often confess to being clueless over the politics of the chequered fabric. Still, that didn't stop the trend being read as inflammatory and insulting in some quarters. Earlier this year, Urban Outfitters pulled its line of \"anti-war woven scarves\", which had been a bestseller, after receiving complaints. \"Due to the sensitive nature of this item, we will no longer offer it for sale,\" the company announced. \"We apologise if we offended anyone, this was by no means our intention.\" </p> <p>In May, Dunkin' Donuts pulled one of its online adverts because Rachael Ray, the celebrity chef that featured in it, was wearing a fashionably knotted keffiyeh. Slamming the scarves as \"Jihadi chic\" and \"hate couture\", popular American blogger and columnist, Michelle Malkin, one of the key campaigners against the black-and-white checks, wrote that, \"Fashion statements may seem insignificant, but when they lead to the mainstreaming of violence - unintentionally or not - they matter.\"</p> <p>Whatever the intention, the global surge in sales has had no impact on the fortunes of the ailing Herbawi factory. The textiles company does not export and, even at a local level, foreign competitors are holding sway. In the market stalls of Jerusalem's Old City, a Hebron factory-made keffiyeh is a rare sight among the scarves on sale to tourists. \"For sure, I prefer the local product,\" says market vendor Saleh abu Ghazela, who stocks the Herbawis' new line of pastel multi-coloured checks alongside Chinese versions of the traditional colour combination. \"But very few customers care about the quality or ask where the scarf comes from, and I have to cater to the market's demands.\" </p> <p>All of which explains why most of the looms aren't even switched on at the Herbawis' factory. Fifteen machines used to operate daily for 18 hours, but now only one section of the vast factory is lit and just four clacking looms turn giant reels of thread into long flats of cloth. A factory technician moves between them, snipping rogue strands and making constant adjustments to the weave. \"He has been our employee for 40 years,\" says Judeh Herbawi, of their last remaining staff member. \"It is because of him that we stay open.\" Beyond this square of light, rows of grand machinery emblazoned with the label \"Suzuki Loom\" stand silent in the shadows, swathed in thick, yellow factory dust. Old swatches of keffiyeh fabric are still stretched out upon these once industrious machines - and underneath the powdery dust, the distinctive pattern so symbolic of the Palestinian national cause has all but faded away.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Thursday September 25 2008. It was Urban Outfitters, rather than American Apparel as we originally said in the article above, that marketed the keffiyeh as an \"anti-war woven scarf\" but stopped selling it after protests. This has been corrected. </p>",
  "<p>On the outskirts of Rome, away from its ancient splendours and heaving piazzas, lies a gleaming new science facility dedicated to discovery, education and research.</p> <p>Set in 30 hectares, the Biomedical University campus comprises a teaching hospital and university. It has 28 laboratories - a number set to increase - 18 operating theatres, a heliport and 400 beds. It will eventually employ up to 300 researchers and there is fierce competition over its degree courses.</p> <p>Last year, more than 1,200 people applied for 80 places to study medicine.</p> <p>At the helm of this mission is Opus Dei - a global network of devout Catholics that has been the subject of negative publicity and mythology since its inception 80 years ago.</p> <p>Clergy and lay people accuse the group of being secretive, controlling, misogynist and ultra-conservative in its theology. It also had ties with authoritarian regimes, with some members attaining seniority in Franco's government.</p> <p>It shot to prominence in 2003 with the publication of The Da Vinci Code. Two characters were Opus Dei members, and both were sinister and devious, with one practising self-mortification, fuelling the idea that it was an extremist movement.</p> <p>Given the group's perceived reputation, campus staff play down affiliations with the movement, insisting there is no obligation to be members of Opus Dei or even Catholic, although the staff are expected to adopt and respect its values.</p> <p>Paolo Maria Rossini, director for scientific activity, is not a member, although the president of the board and a former papal spokesman, Joaquin Navarro Valls, is. Rossini said: \"We don't hide ourselves under the thumb. We are Catholic by declaration. Stem cell research will never be done here. But nobody is going to check how many hours you spend in church.\"</p> <p>Rossini's objective is to develop the research facility's capacity to rival secular scientific institutions, devoting enviable resources to neuroscience and oncology.</p> <p>\"When science is going very close to life and death we need good research to be able to compete with lay research,\" Rossini said. \"The impact of science and medicine is a multi-faceted challenge and one of many frontiers the church has to face.\"</p> <p>His mission bears a Vatican blessing. Tarcisio Cardinal Bertone, secretary of state and the second most senior official in the Roman curia, inaugurated the campus this year. He reminded assembled dignitaries of a key papal belief - that medical science must respect life - and told them: \"Here you must transmit the gospel through your professional work, aided by modern technology.</p> <p>\"You have to make your voices heard in the world of science without renouncing the non-negotiable values of the human patrimony.\"</p> <p>But Opus sceptics noted that Pope Benedict XVI did not attend the campus inauguration and interpreted his absence as a snub. There was also thinly disguised glee when the Vatican replaced Navarro Valls with a Jesuit priest as papal spokesman.</p> <p>It was seen as a blow to the privileged status enjoyed by the group under the papacy of John Paul II, who was so captivated by Opus Dei's aims of sanctifying secular activities that he called them a \"great ideal\" and canonised the founder, Saint Josemaria Escriva, in a manner deemed unusually rapid by Vatican standards. The late pontiff's enthusiasm was a root cause for resentment and suspicion. Under Joseph Ratzinger this emotional connection has cooled.</p> <p>The campus will help to fulfil Opus Dei's vision of creating a white-collar Catholic elite. Typically, members are intense, intelligent and highly motivated, said John Allen, from the National Catholic Reporter and author of a book on the movement.</p> <p>\"There is an ethos of excellence that is part of the culture. If you buy into the philosophy that your everyday work is a service to God then you will do that work really well.\"</p> <p>The group's ability to mould articulate, intelligent, successful individuals accounts for its profile and influence, which is disproportionate to its numbers yet allows it to punch above its weight.</p> <p>Allen says the campus is also a way to inject a note of calm over Opus Dei by providing opportunities for positive encounters with members. \"It has carved out a niche that appeals to people who want to live a serious religious life and have the same level of commitment as a priest or a nun.</p> <p>\"It is about evangelising the profession, bringing a spiritual depth to work. They are interested in bringing a Christian approach to law, politics, architecture, so it's no surprise they're doing it with this campus.\"</p> <p>But one former member, Monsignor Vladimir Felzmann, believes that Opus Dei has a covert agenda to its activities. He was a member for 22 years, joining in 1969, and was one of those closest to its founder. The group's overall aim is to recruit, he said. \"Covertly it's to have something to which you attract leading scientists and persuade them to join. But it's hard to know who belongs and who doesn't because they're encouraged not to tell you. You don't know what they're up to.\"</p> <p>Former members seek out Felzmann, a priest in the London diocese of Westminster, for pastoral care. He concedes that Opus Dei contributes positively in the fields of education and healthcare, yet remains concerned by its impact on individuals who break away.</p> <p>\"When you meet people who, as a result of Opus Dei, give up religion and don't want funeral prayers to be said, then that matters.\"</p> <p>He said he was saddened, rather than bitter, about the group. \"When Christianity and fascism embrace you get Opus Dei. It was born in a time of fascism. They don't teach respect and love for others.\"</p> <p>But Opus Dei continues to grow. Success in Spain, Italy and Latin America has emboldened it to embrace Russia, Kazakhstan, South Korea and Vietnam.</p> <p>Such ambition is not cheap - the campus cost around \u20ac30m (\u00a323.5m) - and Opus Dei receives funding from the European Union and the Italian state for some initiatives. It also has benefactors, sometimes non-members, who finance activities. One Jesuit priest argues the group is \"putting its money where its mouth is\" by wanting to excel in morally acceptable areas.</p> <p>Father John Paris, Walsh Professor of Bioethics at Boston College, said: \"They want to be leaders. They would love to win the Nobel prize. If you're working in cancer research and can choose where to go, you'll go to the best.</p> <p>\"Opus Dei is committed to having an impact on those they think will be influential and successful. Why do people go to Yale or Harvard? Build a bigger mousetrap and better people will come. They want to play with the big boys.\"</p>",
  "<p>Recently, I wrote a book called Bits of Me Are Falling Apart. The story takes place during a single day in my life, a particularly bad day in the summer of 2007. I tried to write down all the thoughts I'd had and the things I'd done on that particular day. It's a sort of black comedy. After I'd written it, my publishers sent me the manuscript so I could check it for mistakes. Then they sent me a copy of the cover. Finally, when I thought everything was done, my editor called again, asking if I thought I should have a blurb.</p> <p>\"A blurb?\"</p> <p>\"Yes. It would be nice to have a blurb.\"</p> <p>I'd forgotten about blurbs. But the process of getting blurbs - which the US journalist Rob Walker has termed \"blurb-harvesting\" - is thought, by some, to be a necessary part of modern book publishing. You send the manuscript of your book to another writer, hoping they'll like it, hoping they will give you a favourable comment to put on the cover. It's a weird transaction. No money changes hands. There is only one unspoken convention: if somebody blurbs your book, you should not blurb theirs. Not until a decent amount of time has elapsed, anyway. So you're asking somebody who is probably busy, and possibly even a rival, to do some work on your behalf, for nothing in return.</p> <p>Nothing, that is, beyond getting their name and comments on the cover of someone else's book. Which might just be good for the blurber, as well as the blurbee. A cynic might say that blurbing is, in a very subtle way, a route to advancement. It might also be good karma: sending positive thoughts out into the world that might eventually come back to you.</p> <p>There are two very definite schools of thought here. Alexander Waugh - son of Auberon, grandson of Evelyn, and whose book The House of Wittgenstein has just been published - hates blurbing: \"I don't want a blurb on the cover of my book. It's distasteful and rather sickening. And I don't think it makes any difference to sales. When I see a blurb - 'A marvellous book!' - my thought is, 'Are they friends?'\" Waugh thinks that being asked to give blurbs is \"like being asked to be a god-parent\". He says he wrote a letter to his editor \"saying the whole thing was boring and embarrassing\".</p> <p>Boring and embarrassing?</p> <p>\"No, I'd say something stronger. It's nauseating and demeaning. I don't believe for a second that people don't know what's going on.\"</p> <p>Waugh thinks blurbing doesn't fool anybody. But Matt Thorne, whose novel Tourist was blurbed by Julie Burchill (\"As sad as a Sunday and as sexy as a scar\"), is in favour of the practice. \"I'm always happy to give blurbs,\" he says. To Thorne, blurbing is about being a helpful part of the literary community. He thinks it's much less corrupt than people might think and can be useful. \"There are certain authors I'd pay attention to,\" he says. \"For instance, Bret Easton Ellis. I'd read anything that Ellis blurbed. Not necessarily because I like him as a writer. But he's got a good eye.\"</p> <p>So is there such a thing as blurbing karma? Let's see. Ellis, one of my favourite writers, was memorably blurbed for his first novel Less Than Zero by Richard Price, who found it \"filled with a languid comic terror\". Price, of course, has been blurbed for his novels: for instance, Dennis Lehane blurbed him as \"the greatest writer of dialogue, living or dead, this country has ever produced\". I love that unnecessary, yet resounding, \"living or dead\".</p> <p>So when Ellis said, of James Frey's memoir A Million Little Pieces, that it was \"a heartbreaking memoir - inspirational and essential\", an experienced bookshop browser would know, by following the trail of blurbs, that this wasn't just any recommendation, but a tip from a writer of languid comic terror (Ellis), defined as such by a great dialogue-writer (Price).</p> <p>Writers, then, mostly stay clear of blurbing their blurbers. But is there something more subtle going on? When Ellis called Frey's book \"a heartbreaking memoir\", was he making a reference to Dave Eggers' memoir A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius? Possibly not. But I'll come to Eggers' book in a moment: I think it's the most lavishly blurbed book I've ever seen. </p> <p>Anyway, I started reading the US essayist Chuck Klosterman's books, partly because of a blurb by Ellis (\"I can't think of a more sheerly likable writer than Chuck Klosterman\") and partly because of a blurb by Douglas Coupland (\"He's the real thing\"). And I read Coupland's Shampoo Planet partly because of a blurb by Nick Hornby (\"A rich, intelligent piece of work\"). And I definitely read Christopher Coake's book of short stories We're in Trouble because of a Hornby blurb. He said: \"Sometimes, when you're reading these stories, you forget to breathe.\" Which, for me, wasn't quite true. But they are terrific stories.</p> <p>Thinking about it, I've been influenced by blurbs the whole of my reading life. I picked up Michael Herr's Vietnam memoir Dispatches because of John Le Carr\u00e9's blurb (\"The best book I have ever read on men and war in our time\") and I loved it. Later, I read Tim O'Brien's Vietnam novel The Things They Carried because of Herr's blurb (\"A heartbreaking and healing masterpiece; time will make it a classic\"). Later still, I read Thom Jones' short stories because of a Herr blurb (\"A writer as brave as he is gifted\"). So when Thom Jones blurbed Richard Price's novel Samaritan (\"superlative\"), I was likely to take notice. And now, thinking of Price, who blurbed Ellis all those years ago, I can see how blurb karma might work.</p> <p>The economics writer Stephen Dubner, co-author of Freakonomics (\"Prepare to be dazzled\" - Malcolm Gladwell), has no truck with blurbs. \"Long ago,\" he says, \"I used to think they mattered a lot. Then I changed my mind, thinking that blurbs don't signal much about the quality of the book, but at least they signal something about the quality of the author's friends or acquaintances who were willing to blurb the book. Lately, I've come to believe that they really don't matter at all, since most readers see blurbs as having about the same level of integrity as a used car salesman's personal promise that the car you're about to buy is A-OK.\"</p> <p>I'm not sure it's as simple as that. Sure, something is going on. But it's definitely not about blurbing someone who's going to blurb you back. Sometimes you notice connections - for instance, Howard Jacobson blurbed Simon Gray, who was a friend of Harold Pinter, who blurbed Jacobson. But surely Pinter, a great writer who must be protective of his reputation, would only have blurbed Jacobson if he really meant it. If you blurb just for the sake of friendship, you're going to lose something in the end. </p> <p>What's going on, I think, is less like a love-in and more like a subtle dance, a sort of shadow-play. The blurber is flattered to be asked, and wants to score a tiny ad for himself on the blurbee's book. But they want it to be the right book. That's why, when Dave Eggers wrote A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius, clearly a brilliant work, the standard of blurbing was so good. \"This book does not need a blurb,\" said Rick Moody, which reminded me that there might be one or two Rick Moody books I hadn't read.</p> <p>So I think blurbing serves a purpose, if you know how to read it. Some blurbs are over the top, such as when a blurber feels flattered, or when he is unconsciously seeking good karma. But I don't think many people want to be blamed by readers for making them read bad books.</p> <p>I called my editor back. I said yes, a blurb would be a good idea. I wondered if maybe Jon Ronson would like the idea of a blackly comic work about a day in the life of a middle-aged man.</p>",

She was a passionate life member of the Eugenics Society, left significant sums to it at her death, and in her writing she detailed her position very clearly.

  "<p>BetFred, the bookie marooned outside the conference's ring of steel in downtown Manchester, is offering 10-1 on Gordon Brown being out a job by the end of the month - the same odds as Ladbrokes gives for leftwinger Jon Cruddas taking over. But who will Brown mention first by name when he makes his big speech in Central Hall, Ladbrokes wonders? For 33-1 you can waste your money on Tony Blair; Sarah Brown is 5-1 and the twin threats, Davids Miliband and Cameron, are both on 8-1. Oddly enough, the 2-1 favourite is Alistair Darling, Brown's loyal chancellor and partner on the storm-tossed seas of global finance. Frequently tipped for the sack, modest Darling may deserve more credit than he claims this week. He lives virtually next door in Edinburgh to former benefit claimant JK Rowling (pictured), who wrote Labour that \u00a31m cheque. Ladbrokes offers 50-1 on the first name-check being Comrade Harry Potter. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Wales's first minister, Rhodri Morgan, is missing his first conference in decades: duty in the shape of Ryder Cup golf detains him. But his fellow Welshman, Prestatyn-born John Prescott of \"fucking Taffs\" fame, turned up in Manchester to hug Charles Clarke on the BBC's Politics Show, not very successfully. Was this because he also dubbed Clarke neither Blairite, nor Brownite, but \"Bitterite\"? Prezza later joined Glenys Kinnock (who is standing down as an MEP) and Alastair Campbell to press \"Go 4th\" stickers - as in a fourth Labour win - on delegates. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Hardcore loyalists would have been even more upbeat if they had known alleged plotters were in disarray. Stephen Byers lost his vital black diary (containing what secrets, Steve?) in the Midland hotel and David Miliband's credit card was rejected in Starbucks, symbol of now-discredited global capitalism. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Bad news for Iain Duncan Smith, who was forced from the Tory leadership weeks after being given an eight-minute standing ovation at his party conference in 2003 (Ladbrokes is unkindly offering 5-2 on Gordon getting longer). IDS may be in no danger of losing his Chingford seat next time, but he may have to work harder. Labour's boisterous candidate Catherine Arakelian revealed the Tories have negotiated \"half-price entry into lap-dancing clubs\" for next week's conference in Brum. \"They are more interested in women being up poles than at the polls,\" she thundered. Applause. Labour gets few cheerful polls these days.</p>",
  "<p>Even if you haven't seen the new Hovis ad on television yet, you will almost certainly have read something about it recently. The commercial broke just over a week ago - but the PR attached to its launch has been spread across newspapers and websites. It's now not enough to just produce your ad and expect that to do the work - advertisers have caught on to the idea that they can gain a higher return from a new campaign by increasing PR around it. </p> <p>Take Honda's recent live parachute jump, for example; or the Marks &amp; Spencer campaigns that are photographed during filming, with the pictures distributed to the press in order to build awareness several weeks before the ads air. Recently the tabloids ran pictures of \"the girls\" - such as Myleene and Erin - cavorting in the snow while on location for the retailer's Christmas campaign. It made a mildly interesting picture story. And then there's Nestle - which released pictures from its Girls Aloud KitKat Senses ad, showing the stars shivering in dressing gowns between shots. Both the chocolate bar and its agency received plenty of press - including front pages - before the ad had even hit the screens. </p> <p>So what does this media interest in advertisments prove? That in spite of what is often considered the consensus, advertising is not widely despised and can still rely on public affection? Or that journalists are under pressure to fill more pages against a background of tighter budgets and competing media? Either way, it feels as if every time you open a newspaper, there is a snippet, story or feature hyping one ad or another. The increasing use of celebrities has made press coverage inevitable. The David Beckham poster ad for Calvin Klein in which he wore the brand's underwear, was almost immeasurable in PR terms. Hand on heart, I don't think I have ever actually seen it, but I know what it looked like, given the surrounding publicity.</p> <p>But ads that don't feature celebrities - and can therefore be harder to promote - still manage to bag those important column inches all the same. Brands often accompany PR briefings with little nuggets of information to capture the public's imagination: how many extras were used; what computer enhancements tricked us; a detailed description of how props were constructed; the length of time needed for the shoot. These are all used to sell an ad story. Occasionally, we are also informed how much it cost - although that sort of admission is rarer in times of financial uncertainty. And while these details may not necessarily sound inspiring, plenty of tabloids are happy to run features based on them, so long as the accompanying pictures grab attention. During the hype surrounding its recent much-lauded ad, Cadbury managed to sell an interview with the man in the gorilla suit.</p> <p>Some agencies can be exceptional when it comes to creating publicity for an ad - and Miles Calcraft Briginshaw Duffy's (MCBD) hype for Hovis has gone well beyond the call of duty. Mimicking a movie's DVD extras, MCBD released a \"behind-the-scenes\" film from the ad. The rise of the web, and brands' acknowledgement that they can reach out to consumers in different ways online, seem to explain these added extras. But they are often a waste of time - viewed by industry insiders, or individuals with an interest in film, but rarely sought out by consumers. The interest levels are just not there. But that has not stopped plenty of brands posting content on their websites.</p> <p>Hovis' original \"boy on the bike\" advertisement is one that is close to my heart - not just because at 35, it is as old as me, but also because it was filmed close to where I come from in Dorset. In remembrance of such a famous ad, Gold Hill in Shaftsbury still has a large loaf of bread at the top of it, and visitors to the town are invited to donate loose change for the upkeep of its famous cobbles. Through all the hype, Hovis will be hoping the new ad celebrating the rather odd anniversary of 122 years is equally well-remembered - even if it can't guarantee the same audience on TV it got in 1973, no matter how much hyping they do.</p> <p><strong>Lurpak cooks up a campaign to promote butter</strong></p> <p>Butter gets a rather bad press. Its high fat content has earned it an association with coronaries and obesity. But one brand, Lurpak, is on a mission to lure younger consumers away from pots of margarine. It ads are a great example of turning advertising on its head by not focusing on the product itself.</p> <p>Instead of showing cows eating green grass in lush meadows, Lurpak has gone after foodies. It shows how its product enhances simple food such crusty bread and grilled fish. Its latest campaign, created by Wieden &amp; Kennedy, champions the simple potato. It's brilliant. The Good Food Deserves Lurpak positioning has had considerable success. Flora, often considered healthier than butter, was the nation's favourite spread but last year Lurpak ousted it from this position. Not something you would expect in the current climate of health fears.</p> <p><strong>Golden wonders</strong></p> <p>The last 50 years have produced hundreds of new brands. Most of them have advertising to thank for their status. The Marketing Society is trying to collate what it calls \"50 golden brands\" to celebrate its half-century anniversary. The organisation has created a website to spark debate among the public about which of these brands are the most iconic. There are quite a few of these listed - including Virgin, Apple and PG Tips - but there are some omissions. Anyone can have a look at 50goldenbrands.com and help decide what should make the final cut.</p> <p>\u00b7 Lucy Barrett is the editor of Marketing</p>",
  "<p><strong>World</strong><br><strong>Dark Burmese days </strong><br>It is a year since a Burmese soldier shot Japanese photographer Kenji Nagai in the heart while he was covering Burma's saffron revolution for the Japanese agency APF News. Nagai's dying moments, spent lying on his back attempting to film his killer, who stood over him taking aim, were captured by another foreign journalist. Reuters photographer Adrees Latif was crouching on a bridge overhead. His image, which subsequently won a Pulitzer Prize, provoked a worldwide furore, exposing the junta's defence - that Nagai's death was caused by a stray bullet - as worthless.</p> <p>The killing of a foreign journalist was highly unusual in a country where reporters who slipped quietly into the country on tourist visas were rarely apprehended. I spent two weeks there earlier this year without any interference. Andrew Marshall, who covered the saffron revolution for Time, says: \"The main difficulty in Burma is reporting the story without endangering your interviewees or the people who help you meet them.\" </p> <p>For Burmese journalists, the situation is a little different. \"Getting caught can mean torture and imprisonment. It can even be a death sentence. They are the ones who run all the risks,\" says Nic Dunlop, a photographer who worked in Burma for more than a decade.</p> <p>Days after the September demonstrations were violently suppressed, after the foreign journalists had flown home, the junta rounded up local reporters and photojournalists. According to Reporters without Borders, 15 journalists were arrested and accused of sending information abroad at this time. The hunt for photojournalists was so intense that several stopped working, threw away their cameras and went into exile.</p> <p>Among those currently detained are photographer U Thaung Sein, in prison for more than two years for photographing Burma's new capital, Naypidaw; blogger and comedian U Zargana, arrested in June for talking to the BBC about the devastation caused by cyclone Nargis; and journalist U Win Tin, who has served 19 years of a 20-year sentence for spreading propaganda during demonstrations in the 1980s.</p> <p>In addition, in the last week, three Burmese news agencies in exile - the Irrawaddy, the Democratic Voice of Burma and The New Era Journal, whose websites locals rely on for uncensored news - have been victims of cyberspace attacks. Each has been bombarded by requests for information designed to overwhelm servers and render sites incapable of responding to regular traffic. Fearful of further unrest during the anniversary of the saffron revolution, the junta appears to be doing its utmost to continue silencing Burmese media.<br><strong>Amy Gold </strong></p> <p><strong>Publishing</strong><br><strong>Writer blocked</strong><br>In the weeks after 9/11, Anthony McIntyre wore a Fire Department of New York baseball hat in solidarity with citizens of the Big Apple who lost their lives in the Twin Towers. His wife is American and his children have American passports. He has dined with the American consul general to Northern Ireland and has been a guest at their 4th of July Independence Day parties.</p> <p>But, according to the US state department, this ex-IRA prisoner turned author remains persona non grata - an unforgiven convicted \"terrorist\" who shouldn't be allowed to set foot on American soil. </p> <p>The ban is preventing McIntyre from promoting his newly published book across the US. \"I would like to go but I have had that many problems getting in before so I wasn't going to waste any more time applying for a visa,\" he says.</p> <p>The book, Good Friday - the Death of Irish Republicanism, is a collection of articles from the online republican dissident e-zine that McIntyre runs with his wife Carrie Towmey. It deals with what he sees as a betrayal of republicanism by the Sinn Fein leadership. Much of the criticism of Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness is lacerating. This, McIntyre believes, is why he cannot get into the US, while Adams and McGuinness (both former IRA prisoners like him) are feted on the other side of the Atlantic as statesmen.</p> <p>\"Past convictions are not a reason for excluding people, otherwise Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness would never have got into America,\" he says.</p> <p>A member of the National Union of Journalists, McIntyre has written on republicanism for, among others, the Observer, the Sunday Tribune in Dublin and the LA Times. \"I do see the ban as double standards,\" he says. \"It's there to load the debate in a certain way regarding Ireland. The American public are not informed about all the issues in Ireland connected to the peace process. It's also very strange because I can write an opinion piece in the comment pages of the LA Times, yet I can't go and explain this in person to American people in their own country.\"<br><strong>Henry McDonald</strong></p> <p><strong>Online</strong><br><strong>Twitter takes flight</strong><br>Twitter made global headlines when James Buck, a graduate journalist, was arrested in Egypt for taking photographs of an anti-government protest earlier this year. On his way to the police station, Buck used his mobile to send the message \"arrested\" to 48 followers on Twitter, which ignited a worldwide campaign to get him released.</p> <p>From that moment, the PR world woke up to the idea that microblogging (Twitter offers a text-based posting system of up to 140 characters in length) could wield a powerful global influence. Most recently, Twitter has been used by Barack Obama to show real-time updates of his progress across America. </p> <p>The Sarah Palin Hockey Mom cult has found its voice through mundane tweets and has been so successful that a large number of satirical tweets have risen around it like cuckoos - the FakeSarahPalin twitter now has more followers than the official Palin site. Palin's PR people may have used it initially to try to expand her personality, but the satirists have the upper hand, because they understand the medium more acutely.</p> <p>Celebrities and their minders are following the trend, including John Cleese and Henry Rollins, intravenously dripping fan bases with soundbites and mindless minutiae, and sidestepping the media hordes. The beauty of Twitter is that it can be linked to a mobile phone, meaning that fans of the Twittering stars can get the information the instant it is disgorged. It's a mode of control, but the PR luvvies need to be smarter.</p> <p>Throughout PR's history, the best publicists have embraced the latest technologies, be it wire service or mobile phone, and used them to enhance a client's profile. The trouble is that the more one sees of the star's life, the less effulgent said celebrity becomes - just look at Britney Spears or Amy Winehouse.</p> <p>So PRs behind the celebrity tweets need to take care, otherwise Twitter could end up making twits of those who tweet because they become totally over-exposed or subsumed in imitators. One just has to look at the early craze on Twitter for people pretending to be Darth Vader or Boba Fett, which started out as charming and funny and swiftly became deeply tedious.</p> <p>If celebrities and their minders over-indulge in Twitter, only the most restrained and interesting characters will survive. Survival of the Twittest, perhaps?<br><strong>Mark Borkowski</strong></p>",
  "<p>In the end it was just another of Paul Azinger's masterstrokes. The decision to send out the three southerners and crowd favourites, Kenny Perry, Boo Weekley and JB Holmes, as a cluster in the middle of his pack could not have been more successful, the trio all triumphant shortly before Jim Furyk's clinching victory.</p> <p>After the United States' four big guns at the top of the batting order managed only 1\u00bd points, the middle third were the players who delivered the necessary points. Phil Mickelson said last night it was \"our two people from Kentucky ultimately won us the match\", the first of many thousands to pay homage to Perry and Holmes, who defeated Henrik Stenson and Soren Hansen respectively.</p> <p>\"This is just so emotional,\" said Perry, who opted not to play in the Open to ensure he qualified to play here. \"My dad, my wife, my three kids came out to give me a hug - I couldn't hold back the tears. It is the greatest day of my life. To come out and make seven or eight birdies and have the putting of Tiger Woods for one day was fantastic. This was my last hurrah, the swansong to my career - what a way to go out.\"</p> <p>Holmes was similarly ebullient. \"I think I'm higher now than I was on the golf course,\" he said. \"To be able to be on a winning Ryder Cup team and win two points is just unbelievable and to be able to do it in my home state, I couldn't in my farthest dreams have imagined this. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\"</p> <p>Weekley has developed a cult following this week with his gesticulations to the galleries, who have chanted variations on his name throughout, and he admitted that he now preferred golf to his favourite past-times of hunting or fishing. </p> <p>\"It's amazing, so unreal,\" said Weekley, who beat fellow rookie Oliver Wilson yesterday to maintain his unbeaten record. \"The feeling you get when you're out there - I can barely stand up and get chillbumps when they chant my name and 'U-S-A'. The adrenaline I got here ain't nothing like shooting a deer - it's so much more.\"</p> <p>The excellent golf produced from the trio has ignited the fans all week, and Azinger praised his \"13th man\" for their role in the victory. \"The crowd was fantastic and beautifully behaved,\" he said. \"The atmosphere at the first tee was amazing and the golf was spectacular on both sides. I came in with a plan. These guys came together as a group and we stuck with a message. I told every player they were on a free role because nobody expected thatmuch. It could've gone either way but it tilted our way.\" </p> <p>\"My players poured their heart and soul into it this week.They played great, the crowd was unbelievable and I couldn't be happier. You know, they brought themselves there and if I was the guy that helped organise it, then I'm happy to be that. But those guys did it. They deserve the credit for this.\"</p> <p>The absence of the world No1, Tiger Woods, was the only lament for Azinger. \"Tiger was great,\" he said. \"He kept texting me all week and I missed him. I really wanted to spend that week with him.\"</p>",
  "<p>Comedic formulae must be used carefully and subtly, because the more they are used the more familiar and predictable they become and thus the less effective. You will need the misdirectional skills of a magician to hide the approaching gag.</p> <p><strong>Rule of three</strong></p> <p>Grouping items into threes can provide a satisfying pay off. The first thing in the list introduces the idea, the second thing reinforces it, but then the third thing (using the comedic law of surprise) deviates from what is expected.</p> <p>Here's Woody Allen: \"By love, of course, I refer to romantic love - the love between man and woman, rather that between mother and child, or a boy and his dog, or two head waiters.\"</p> <p><strong>Pull back and reveal</strong></p> <p>A term derived from the TV practice of panning out from a close-up to discover a humorous situation. Essentially you are holding back a piece of pertinent information until the end of the story.</p> <p>In the wrong hands this is a hackneyed and predictable technique, with cliched punchlines including, \"then I got off the bus,\" and \"that was just the teachers!\" But used with skill it can be sublime, as with this opener from the visually startling, dishevelled Michael Redmond, \"People often say to me ... get out of my garden.\"<br><strong><br>Puns </strong></p> <p>It is difficult to get away with too much word play in a stand-up set, as most puns are fairly corny or obvious , though if you are relentless and unashamed it can be quite infectious. Discovering a new pun can be very impressive. This from the brilliant Milton Jones: </p> <p>\"While I was in Australia I learnt some Aboriginal words like 'boo', which means to 'return' - cos when you throw an ordinary meringue ... \"<br><strong><br>Observational comedy </strong></p> <p>Observational comedy essentially involves saying \"Did you ever notice?\" and then recounting something that will hopefully be universally familiar, but that won't necessarily have been consciously noted by your audience. If it's too obvious an observation it won't be funny (Have you ever noticed how buses always come in threes? Yes.) and if it's too oblique then it won't hit home. Jerry Seinfeld is the master: \"Did you ever notice when you blow in a dog's face he gets mad at you? But when you take him in a car he sticks his head out the window.\"</p> <p><strong>Character comedy </strong></p> <p>It's tempting to try and hide behind a false persona on stage. But creating a character that will work in a stand-up situation is a lot more difficult than just being yourself. For every Alan Partridge and John Shuttleworth, there are a thousand men in funny hats and long coats, trying and failing to be E L Wisty. It is a better idea, when starting out, to make your persona merely a slightly funnier or exaggerated version of yourself. But if you really want to go down the character route then make sure you are capable of stepping outside of the script and engaging the audience. Then do a lot of work on creating a persona that is three-dimensional and original.</p> <p><strong>Saying the unsayable</strong></p> <p>Performers such as Chris Morris and Brendon Burns challenge an audience's preconceptions by shocking them. One of the functions of comedy is to act as a release valve. When we laugh at something sick or horrendous it takes away some of our anxiety, even if it is only for a few minutes. </p> <p>But even in the hands of an experienced comic, joking about such topics as paedophilia, racism, rape or cancer can go horribly awry. It is best avoided completely as a novice, but if you insist on trying then do not be offensive just for the sake of it, try to make some kind of point. And know what that point is, so you are able to justify your material.</p> <p><strong>Dealing with hecklers</strong></p> <p>This is usually easier than it appears, though occasionally nothing you do will make a persistent drunk shut up (put \"Richard Herring heckler\" into YouTube to see me struggling with such a sot). </p> <p>There are some useful stock lines which you can employ:</p> <p>\"This is what happens when cousins marry.\"</p> <p>\"I remember when I had my first drink.\"</p> <p>\"It's annoying isn't it? You start up a really good conversation and someone builds a comedy club around you.\"</p> <p>But in most cases you're actually better off if you just calmly respond to whatever is being shouted at you with the first thing that comes into your head. Audiences are much more impressed with improvisation than with prepared put-downs, and the chances are that the heckler is much drunker and far less funny than you. </p> <p>Most importantly, try not to lose control of the situation. In the YouTube exchange you can see that I am furious about the guy wrecking my act, but I just about manage to stay in command. </p> <h2>Exercise: Comedy blogging</h2> <p>Write a blog. Take one amusing thing that happened in your day and try to describe it. You will normally really struggle to think of anything and be forced to examine the minutiae of your life, but you might recall something that passed you by at the time. </p> <p>If you are stuck write about something mundane and look for the ridiculousness in something you take for granted. I have been writing a blog daily for six years (<a href=\"http://www.richardherring.com/warmingup\">richardherring.com/warmingup</a>) and have generated a huge amount of material for stand-up.

Choose your subject (for example, vacuous celebrity culture)</p> <p>2. Define your attitude. How does the subject make you feel? Happy? Sad? Angry? A passionate point of view makes a joke stronger.</p> <p>3. Write as much as you can about your chosen subject. Use similes, oxymorons, cliches, proverbs, double entendres, whatever you want. Make lists of people, places and things associated with the subject (eg Jordan, Kerry Katona, Big Brother, Paris Hilton, Heat magazine, BBC3, Lily Allen, Pete Doherty, her with the rats maze hairdo and tattoos, Heather Mills buying a shoe).</p> <p>4. Cast your eye over what you've written and the funniest bits will stick out. Those are the bits you want.</p> <p>5. Edit, edit, edit. Cut away as much as possible. Your mildly amusing two-page story can become a fantastic one-line joke.</p> <p>6. Misdirection. Inflate the balloon. Lead the audience as far away from the joke as you can: \"Me and my friend Allison (*) have been invited to a fancy dress party ... we're going as Paris Hilton and Jodie Marsh.\"</p> <p>7. Time for a PAUSE. What you don't say is just as important. The audience thinks quicker than you can speak so let them conjure up their own pictures of a fancy dress party. </p> <p>8. Quickly spin them in the opposite direction and burst the balloon. \"I'm getting a lobotomy and Allison is having her vagina widened.\" Almost there.</p> <p>9. Listen to the audience. Audiences will help you write the joke. Originally Allison and I were going to be John Leslie and Ulrika Jonsson, then we were going to be Lembit Opik and Abi Titmuss. It was the British public who, after much trial and error, chose \"Paris Hilton and Jodi Marsh\".</p> <p>10. Jokes don't obey no rules of English grammar, baby.</p> <p>PS: Always put the punchline at the end, don't laugh at your own jokes, don't get them wet, keep them out of strong sunlight and never feed them after midnight.</p> <p>(*) I'm aware that it should be \"My friend Allison and I ... \" but ...</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Jo Caulfield was a gag writer on all five series of the BAFTA award-winning show So Graham Norton.</p>",
  "<p>'Writing\" always means \"not writing\" to me, because I will do anything to put it off. </p> <p>I think this is mainly because writing anything down and then handing it over to a third party - especially in comedy - is such an exposing act that you naturally want to delay the process. </p> <p>Also, the control required to get ideas out of my head and into some tangible form that I can present to others doesn't come easily to me. I will quite simply do anything other than sit down in front of a blank screen and begin. I just can't do it, or more accurately, won't. The irony is that once I have stopped colour coding my tea towels and leaving messages for people I haven't spoken to in years, I do get into the flow of it and, dare I say it, enjoy writing. But it's the getting started.</p> <p>I remember writing (or not writing) my first show for the Edinburgh festival. I had to literally drag that show out of me word by painful word. Being a deadline junkie, I went right up to the wire and had to cancel all the London previews as a consequence. I had half an idea about doing some characters: an old lady, a highly sexed Irish nurse, a drunk bride. </p> <p>But I had nothing concrete and certainly nothing written down. </p> <p>When I arrived at the Pleasance, the venue where I was performing, the stage manager asked me for a copy of the script so she could plot the lighting and sound cues. Busted. It dawned on me just how little prepared I was and I mumbled something about \"not really working like that\" as I felt a wave of panic rise up and threaten to choke me. We agreed to go with visual cues for the sound and light.</p> <p>Few things focus the mind like fear. That night - the opening night - the show somehow went well. It was part-improvised and entirely raw, being the first time I'd performed any of it in front of anyone, let alone a paying crowd. But I had enough of a skeleton of the material in my head to get through it, and I came off stage with relief pouring out of me. I still feel grateful that my fledgling comedy career didn't crash and burn during those 50 minutes. The first thing I did was ask if anyone remembered what I'd said. Finally it was time to write things down.</p> <p>I went to an internet cafe and typed up everything I could remember saying and although it wasn't word for word, by about 2am I had a fairly decent-sized document that, once it had been printed out and bound in a cellophane folder, looked dangerously like a script. The sense of achievement was immense. But it didn't have to be that stressful.</p> <p>Over the next 30 odd shows I performed that August the show changed dramatically. Every night things would be added and improved upon; it was a moveable feast that became the basis of my TV show a few years later. That Edinburgh show was a steep learning curve for me and the most important thing I learnt (aside from it being helpful to write a show before you perform it) was how valuable an audience is. When we came to recording the first series of my show, almost every sketch had been tried out in front a live crowd and was all the better for it.</p> <p>So I suppose what I'm saying is I don't feel in a position to give advice about writing because, technically, I don't consider myself a writer. I've just fallen into bad habits, habits that have now become the way I work and so far no one's asked for their money back. But if I can offer up a few random things it's these: Trust yourself. You have to start with what you think is funny before you can have the confidence to write to anyone else's brief Give a gag three chances to work, if after three (separate) attempts they're still not laughing, bin it. It's not them. It's you. Don't take criticism personally, take from it what's useful. Apply it and move on to something better. And be brave. No one got anywhere by being too scared to open their mouth in case nobody laughed. Good luck!

  "<p>Worcester had everything to celebrate but a win on Saturday. This was their first home game of the season, and it saw the opening of their impressive new stand. The crowd was the largest in the club's history, and hundreds of them had come wearing cork-dangling hats and Australian jerseys in tribute to the new signing Chris Latham, making his first Premiership appearance at Sixways.</p> <p>For much of the match they looked certain to secure a win over Leicester to commemorate the occasion. They went ahead in the first half with a bullocking try from the prop Matt Mullan and twice led by five points in the second. But Toby Flood's boot kept chipping away at their advantage and Julien Dupuy's late try and conversion snatched victory for Leicester.</p> <p>After Mullan's effort Leicester, who had led through a Flood penalty, hauled themselves back in front, despite losing Jordan Crane to the sin-bin, with penalties to Flood either side of the interval. It was not clear that the first of them had gone over, and when the kick was awarded the Worcester crowd roared disapproval. Their director of rugby, Mike Ruddock, said after the match that he \"didn't originally think it went over\". The decision was a \"tough call\" on his team, he said, but was gracious enough to admit that \"sometimes they go your way, sometimes they don't\".</p> <p>The second half was laced with incident and drama, meaning that controversial kick was far from the only turning point. Ruddock's team acquitted themselves superbly throughout. Their No8 Netani Talei took back control of the game, charging through midfield to score from 40 yards out after Chris Pennell's initial break from a Leicester drop-out. The conversion gave them a five-point cushion, which Flood trimmed with his fourth penalty.</p> <p>A dazzling run by Latham, whose most memorable contribution until that point had been a burst of foul-mouthed curses after a wayward kick, covered most of the pitch but ended metres short of the Leicester line. Flood then played the ball on the ground and was sent to the sin-bin. Loki Crichton kicked the ensuing penalty and again Worcester were five points clear and a man up, with James Collins returning from the sin-bin for a dangerous tackle.</p> <p>Leicester, though, are not so easily beaten. Inspired by their captain, Martin Corry, they battered their way into Worcester's half. Crane carried the ball on and the Worcester line gave way. Dupuy snuck through a gap for the try and, with Flood still off the pitch, added the conversion that gave Leicester the lead. </p> <p>The match was described by the Leicester coach, Heyneke Meyer, as \"one of the best games I've seen in the Premiership\". At Worcester there is a real sense that they are constructing a formidable team. With Marcel Garvey, Hal Luscombe and Rico Gear all yet to return from injury to join Latham in a potent back line, the club have built well on their solid foundations. They will be more of a force this season than most pundits have predicted. Leicester's presence at the top of the table is less surprising, but their brutally efficient rugby will be welcomed at Welford Road after the inconsistencies of the last campaign.</p> <p><strong>Worcester</strong> Latham (M Jones, 69min); Pennell, Rasmussen, Tuitupou, Benjamin; Crichton (Fellows, 79), Powell; Mullan, Lutui (Fortey, 64), Horsman (Taumoepeau, 33), Rawlinson (Gillies, 71), Bowley, Wood, Collins (Horstmann, 71), Talei.</p> <p><strong>Tries</strong> Mullen, Talei. <strong>Cons</strong> Crichton 2. <strong>Pen</strong> Crichton.</p> <p><strong>Sin-bin</strong> Collins (57).</p> <p><strong>Leicester</strong> G Murphy; Varndell, Smith, Mauger, J Murphy (Erinle, 79); Flood, Dupuy (Youngs, 71); Ayerza, Kayser (Chuter, 59), White (Cole, 65), Corry, Kay (Wentzel, 55), Croft, Herring (B Woods, 72), Crane.</p> <p><strong>Try</strong> Dupuy. <strong>Con</strong> Dupuy. <strong>Pens</strong> Flood 4.</p> <p><strong>Sin-bin</strong> Crane 36, Flood 60.</p> <p><strong>Referee</strong> A Small (RFU). <strong>Attendance</strong> 10,500.</p>",
  "<p>Ask anyone to keep count of the number of times they get angry in one day and my guess is the figure would head towards double digits pretty quickly. If you're a woman with a stressful full-time job, three children under six, a diabetic Airedale terrier, a pregnant nanny, a partner who also works full-time and a staff of 35 other women to manage then, believe me, that number easily surpasses double digits by lunchtime. But given our time-poor (and now cash-poor) \"have-it-all\" lifestyle, isn't a simmering level of female fury understandable? To be expected even? I thought so, until my colleagues suggested I take an anger management course. </p> <p>Let me explain. I wanted to commission a debate on how cross women seem to be today - from the media-hyped explosion of aggressive girl gangs to the observation that the women taking part in the BBC's Apprentice seemed to get so much angrier than the male contestants. \"Let's get someone to test anger-management solutions,\" I said. Ten minutes later my features editor popped her head round my office door and suggested I was the perfect candidate. </p> <p>The good news? My team weren't too scared to suggest anger management to me in person; I mean I'm not Tony Soprano for goodness sake. The bad news? When quizzed, a friend confirms I do spend a ludicrous amount of time getting angry about everything and nothing, barely keeping a lid on the \"mean reds\" as Holly Golightly called them in Breakfast at Tiffany's. Let's be clear, I am not the female equivalent of Gordon Ramsay. I never shout at people, and I cope well in a crisis. No cover for the October issue? I'm as cool as a cucumber. Mobile phone lost at bottom of handbag? Steam is coming out of my ears. </p> <p>It's the small stuff that infuriates me. I'm prone to checkout rage, bus-stop rage, taxi rage, and changing-room rage, but it's mostly white-goods rage that takes up my time. Other significant fury flashbacks include the time I beat my non-starting VW Beetle Basil Fawlty style with a branch, the day my husband hauled me off the broken dishwasher, as I attacked it with the business end of a Louboutin, and the toaster with a fork permanently rammed in it, like a piece of mad modern art. But I am not alone. A recent study by the Mental Health Foundation concluded Britain is becoming an angrier nation, with women finding it harder to control their rage. Ultimately, I don't like feeling this cross: it's tiring and my children have started to mimic my Marge Simpson-like growling.</p> <p>I set out to try four treatments that each offer a different ethos of tackling anger and stress. First up is an appointment at the Hale Clinic to see Dawn Templeton, a counsellor and psychotherapist. She explores the emotions behind my angry outbursts, and the learned behaviour of the sufferer. She asks how anger was dealt with in my family as a child. My recollection is that it was fine to show anger, usually quite loudly.</p> <p>\"There is a difference between expressing anger and understanding the origin of the anger,\" she tells me. \"By attempting to understand the feelings behind the anger, and often normalise them, you feel heard and hopefully understood. Once a person feels understood, they can access the feelings underneath the anger, which are often those of sadness, disappointment and grief. The anger masks those feelings and acts like a protective blanket around us. </p> <p>\"So, if you have had parents who are freely able to express anger this may have given you permission to express your own anger, but - and this is a big but - until you understand your own anger and why it leaks out everywhere, you will stay in a frustrated place, any additional stress on top will cause it to leak out,\" she tells me.</p> <p>Templeton likens my anger to a glass of water, which keeps spilling over the top but needs to be emptied from below. Counselling is a lengthy process and she recommends six one-hour sessions, which I don't have time for. She uses a simple technique, which can help in the meantime. The TRAIN acronym: \"T\", talk to someone; \"R\", relax in a way that suits you; \"A\" for activity - keep fit; \"I\" for interest, find one; \"N\" for nutrition, take care of what you put into your body. This makes sense to me. Sometimes I think tiredness may be the reason for most of my anger. My youngest wakes at around 6am every day. </p> <p>Next I try laughter yoga. The theory is that you learn to fake laughter and thus fool your body into releasing feelgood chemicals that boost your immune system and help you deal with stress better. Laughter can lower blood pressure and produce endorphins that promote wellbeing. It is used in hospitals, especially with children, to boost immune systems and generate a positive attitude. </p> <p>Julie Whitehead, a laughter trainer dressed top to toe in pink, teaches me how to laugh spontaneously, at nothing. We sing a song (All my cells are well), we \"ho ho ho\" while waltzing around the room and we try \"humour aerobics\", which is literally forcing your face into a smile. There's not much yoga, but apparently that would be included in follow-up sessions. I love the idea of laughter yoga (just thinking about it makes me, well, laugh) but I'm far to uptight for this kind of stress relief. Though I do try forcing out a spontaneous smile every now and again - it's especially effective in a tense meeting: weirdly if you smile everyone else does too. </p> <p>Now for hypnotherapy. Steve Burns, of the Therapy Lounge in London, explains how he will help me \"relearn\" my reactions to things that make me angry. He will programme me under hypnosis. I respond well. It normally takes a person three sessions to go into as deep a \"sleep\" as I do, he tells me after 30 minutes of hypnosis which feels like five seconds to me. I recall very little. Frankly I'm just grateful to be lying on a couch for 30 minutes during the day. His advice is useful: if you can recognise that you cannot control many situations you are in, your reaction to them is calmer. It is also about the language you use with yourself. \"I must get that bus.\" Really? You'd like to but in reality you may not; you have no control over this. \"Must\"/\"need\"/\"have to\" are harsh words to use. I now keep a 30-minute session on my iPod. It all makes sense, but it takes time and patience. </p> <p>A little disheartened, I try some ki energy treatment. Tired, irritable, with the words of South Park's Cartman ringing in my ears -\"bunch of tree-hugging hippy crap\" - I reluctantly head off to see Master Oh (yes, that is his name). But I tell you, if you haven't had a small Korean man in nicely ironed linens belch, yawn, hiss and grunt at you as he painfully pummels your abdomen, you are missing out on something quite extraordinary. The theory is that ki - or energy - flows through us all. When it flows freely it keeps us healthy and happy, but when there are blockages the energy slows down and turns toxic, making it difficult to deal with stress and harming the immune system. This treatment unblocks the blockages. The ki master re-vibrates your energy with the noises he makes so it flows more fluidly and massages your energy knots. He also gives you his energy. I'm not sure how. </p> <p>Master Oh tells me I have a fiery energy and a very sensitive system; this makes me creative but volatile. I use all my energy up immediately, he says, and it is all in the upper part of my body, which explains the weakness of my kidneys (he's right, I do get kidney infections). Three sessions down the line I feel a lot calmer and a lot less stressed. This has made a real difference. I am also sleeping well.</p> <p>So what have I learned? The basic problem is one most working women with young families face - I don't have enough hours in the day and this makes me impatient and frustrated. The female ability to multi-task is not a godsend, it is a curse, and I think it makes women secretly furious. Oddly the ki energy treatment seems to have made me feel physically less stressed and less wired on a day to day basis. I have slowed down and begun to accept that I cannot control every situation. Buses will be late, four-year-olds will insist on wearing odd shoes to school, gadgets will defy me. </p> <p>Being able to show your anger, according to Templeton, is a skill, not a problem. Keeping it inside is damaging and, she believes, can often lead to various forms of depression. Counselling is probably the key treatment if your anger is really affecting the way you live. But I think anger like mine is part of the female condition. There is a line in the Simpsons movie that sums it up for me. Lisa tells her mother she is so full of anger she doesn't know what to do about it. \"Lisa,\" says Marge, \"you're a woman, you can hold onto it for the rest of your life\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Lorraine Candy is editor-in-chief of Elle magazine</p>",
  "<p>No one at the top of the ruling African National Congress admits it directly but the caretaker government that will take over after President Thabo Mbeki formally resigns will have one primary task - to keep the man the party wants to make the next elected president, Jacob Zuma, out of jail.</p> <p>But to do that the new administration will have to do what the party accused Mbeki of when it toppled him this weekend - exerting political influence over the justice system.</p> <p>The ANC secretary general, Gwede Mantashe, hinted as much in announcing that an important factor in the party's decision to \"recall\" Mbeki was the national prosecutor's plan to appeal against a high court judgment that threw out corruption charges against Zuma. The judge, Chris Nicholson, accused Mbeki, members of his cabinet and the chief prosecutor of using apartheid-style tactics to prosecute Zuma as part of the \"titanic political struggle\" for control of the ANC.</p> <p>With that ruling, Zuma's supporters thought their man was off the hook and that, as the ANC leader, he had a clear run to be elected the country's next president in May. But then prosecutors announced their decision to appeal, a move the ANC leadership saw as an attempt by Mbeki to keep alive the judicial pursuit of Zuma.</p> <p>\"The biggest worry of the ANC had been the question of a reversal of the closure of the chapter that the Nicholson judgment seemed to have promised,\" said Mantashe. \"If pursued it will continue to be a point of division for the ANC. We share (people's) desire for stability and we believe our decision is in the interests of making that security\".</p> <p>The official opposition, the Democratic Alliance, said that, far from creating stability, forcing a sitting president from office in order to manipulate justice could only create insecurity.</p> <p>The DA leader, Helen Zille, noted that while the high court stopped the prosecution because of alleged interference by Mbeki it did not clear Zuma of charges of taking bribes from a French arms company bidding for contracts in South Africa's biggest weapons deal. \"The move is clearly an attempt to find the political solution to Jacob Zuma's legal problems that his supporters have been calling for,\" she said. \"Replacing President Mbeki with a Zuma proxy will open the way for them to ensure that he does not have to face court to answer the 783 allegations of corruption against him. If Zuma is put above the law it will do more to undermine the constitution than anything else.</p> <p>\"It is untenable for Jacob Zuma to assume the presidency without being acquitted of these charges by a court of law. Judge Nicholson's judgment was not an acquittal.\"</p> <p>But even if the prosecution goes ahead, it is unlikely to come to court before the general election and few in the ANC or outside of it imagine that a sitting president would allow himself to be put on trial.</p> <p>One option for Zuma is for the interim president who will take over from Mbeki for the remainder of his term, or Zuma himself after next year's election, to declare an amnesty for crimes associated with the arms deals. Zuma is not the only one tainted by the scandal. The ANC itself banked millions of pounds. </p> <p>Zuma had threatened that if he was forced into court he would begin to name names. An amnesty would get those others off the hook as well, including Zuma's former financial adviser, Schabir Shaik, whose conviction in 2005 for bribing Zuma on behalf of a French arms company earned him 15 years in prison and launched the titanic battle with Mbeki that has brought down the second president of the post-apartheid era.</p>",
  "<p>So they finally killed Jack Alderman after all. More than 33 years after his conviction for the murder of his wife, the whole time spent on Georgia's death row, he was executed last Wednesday despite frantic last-minute attempts to have him reprieved. </p> <p>Alderman had claimed from the start he was innocent, even refusing to enter into plea bargains that would have spared his life, because that would have meant admitting his culpability. We shall never know whether he was guilty. His alleged co-conspirator, who gave evidence against him in return for a lenient sentence, 12 years, is long dead by his own hand. But his guilt or innocence doesn't matter. No one should be incarcerated for 33 years in the shadow of the execution chamber. It is an act of barbarism to keep any man in those conditions. Several eminent human rights lawyers have not hesitated to describe it as torture. The Privy Council, the final court of appeal for many Caribbean countries, ruled in a Jamaican case that keeping a man on death row for more than five years amounted to cruel and unusual punishment.</p> <p>Alderman was, all agree, a model prisoner, a Christian, quiet and helpful, liked by fellow prisoners and prison staff. That too is irrelevant. The same would apply if he had been an unpleasant character, disliked by all. </p> <p>His execution made no headlines in the American media, not even in Georgia. The short reports were matter-of-fact, with little suggestion that there was anything untoward about the case. Few in the US were interested in Jack Alderman's fate, and it was left to passionate British campaigners to raise Alderman's profile and bring his case before the courts and various state authorities. It didn't help him in the end, but at least British concern gave him a chance that American indifference had denied him. There, the prevalent attitude to lengthy stays on death row is that they are the fault of the prisoners. If they hadn't kept appealing against their convictions, pleading for mercy and raising all sorts of other issues about their incarceration or methods of execution (such as the recent challenge against lethal injection), they could have been executed years and years before. </p> <p>For once, a mention of diversity in the judiciary is not accompanied by a whinge about the under-representation of women or the ethnic minorities. The news is that the court of appeal of England and Wales has its first openly gay judge, Sir Terence Etherton, who has just finished a stint as chairman of the Law Commission. Two years ago he was the first high court judge publicly to announce his entering into a civil partnership. The other known gay high court judge, Sir Adrian Fulford, is now a judge at the international criminal court in The Hague. But lest you get the idea that England is in the forefront of this aspect of progressive diversity, far from it. Probably Australia's best-known judge and member of its highest appeal court, Justice Michael Kirby, is gay; and, on South Africa's supreme court, Justice Edwin Cameron has admitted having HIV/Aids.</p>",
  "<p>Finding some perspective in these chilly financial times should be easy for me; I spent much of my young adult life in one of the poorest countries in Europe - Romania. It began as a gap year; I worked in a large psychiatric hospital for children and returned the following summer to teach English at Iasi University. It was the early 1990s, the country was broken and the population was in shock. Under Nicolae Ceausescu, they had been crushed by the cruellest of communist regimes and readjustment was proving painful. </p> <p>Yet to be foreign was to be sought after and looked after, so I was treated like a princess - families threw open their doors, blew their weekly salaries and cracked open country wine. Blissfully unaware of the sacrifices they were making on my behalf, I nodded and smiled, accepted more free food, while longing for steak and chips, and every three months boarded a BA plane back to Britain, my own bed and long, hot showers. </p> <p>I had no real concept of the poverty an average family endured, although if I had chosen to look, the signs were there: cigarettes bought and sold singly, the same food served for breakfast, lunch and dinner, and a constant obsession with cost. Generally, however, I was shielded from hardships considered too undignified to share with the blonde foreigner. Only when I fell in love with Dan, a student in Iasi, did I begin properly to understand the limitations placed on their daily lives. When I was in Britain, Dan did not email me because he had no money for the internet cafe; the family phone did not ring because the bell was broken, so we rarely talked; and he wore the same clothes every time I saw him. I lived in a different world; if I bought fewer shoes, I could fly out to visit him monthly. And when I didn't have the cash, there was always my credit card. Once in Romania, dating was cheap - the poor quality of the shops and restaurants did not invite temptation and male pride prevented Dan from enjoying my western currency. </p> <p>We married in 2005, and have lived together in Britain for five years. To begin with, he shook his head at our opulent world and in particular at my material ways - a newspaper here, a frothy coffee there. He would put out a restraining hand to check my spending, insist we took the bus not the train, and polished his shoes until they shone. But he has been quick to acquire our habits. Now, he showers daily, buys lunches out and cranks up the heating instead of pulling on a jersey. Only occasionally will he stop eating, mid-meal, and say how lucky we are. </p> <p>Dan has put his frugal past behind him, as has much of his country. Romania is currently one of the fastest growing economies in Europe and the visible signs of increased wealth litter the landscape. Gaudy villas, congested roads and international advertising tell a very different story from 10 years ago. The losers are the older generation living off meagre factory pensions. It is the likes of Dan's mother, Elena, surviving on \u00a335 a week, who have borne the brunt of the transition. </p> <p>So it was to Elena I turned while visiting Romania this summer, when for the first time my own financial bubble looked as if it might just burst. Sleeping badly, I would wake in the early hours each morning, the same all-consuming anxieties taunting me. Why did I get pregnant in a pending recession? How would we repay the debt on Dan's university fees? What to do with a house bought when property prices were peaking? Where next when your mortgage is interest-only? </p> <p>We met at 4am in her tiny kitchen - Elena up out of habit, me unable to sleep. And in the same grey block where I first met Dan, his mother sat and listened as I tried to explain my very western worries. How to cope with a small child when self-employed, having an unmanageable mortgage because I wanted a room for the baby, and what to do if either Dan or I lost our jobs. He is a market research trainee and I am a broadcaster - neither job is recession-proof. Elena listened in silence. She could not give her alien daughter-in-law advice, nor would she presume to tell me how to live my life. Instead, she simply told me how she had survived hers. </p> <p>Under Ceausescu, Elena worked six days a week in a textile factory, putting elastic into men's underpants, while her husband learned to love his country's most lethal companion - alcohol. Dan was a third, and unplanned, child - a product of the contraception ban that was then in force. By the 80s, food and energy were rationed and the shops were empty. </p> <p>Nappies were virtually non-existent, as was powdered milk. A tiny baby, Dan went with Elena to the factory at 5am where she put him in a basement creche. Florin, his brother, then just six years old, was left at home alone. There was no room in kindergarten because of the population explosion and there was no money to pay for alternative care. There wasn't much in the flat he could break and little that could harm him. He had one toy - a small, yellow, plastic cowboy. Meanwhile, Marcel, at seven the oldest son, left the house at dawn and went to join the milk queue, or the bread queue. Then he walked himself to school. </p> <p>\"That was having children in communist times,\" Elena told me. I thought of my obsessive western discussions about five bits of fruit a day, organic versus free range, nursery versus nanny, plastic toys versus wooden ones, and nodded silently. What could I say?</p> <p>The 90s were a rude awakening. A powerful clique ran away with the country's national assets and families such as Elena's were left to struggle on, minus the meagre security that came with communism. Her factory closed in 1992, inflation rose to more than 300% and the food that arrived in the shops taunted hard-pressed consumers. Elena admitted that, for her, this was financially the toughest time. I remembered how 15 years earlier she had fed me generously whenever I turned up at her table and I coloured when she confessed that the standard family fare back then had been little more than bread or potatoes or polenta - anything to fill their bellies. The concept of a grilled piece of meat was so fanciful that Dan referred to it as dessert and any trace of animal was stretched into rice-filled vine leaves or meatballs made with stale bread. Elena gives a whole new meaning to economy cooking. I didn't dare tell her that in Britain a standard household throws away \u00a3600 worth of food a year, or how Dan and I scrape our leftovers into the dustbin. Elena still has only one small bin in her flat; if you don't buy much there's not much to throw away. </p> <p>\"Things have got easier now, especially for the young,\" she conceded, but I know the money she keeps between tea towels in her kitchen cabinet is never quite enough. Luckily, old habits die hard. Watching television in the dark, mending electrical appliances and having a hot bath just once a week are all money-saving tricks mastered in the Ceausescu era of daily shortages. And Elena, who used to share a bed with her sons, now sleeps with her granddaughter in the living room. Communal sleeping frees up space and keeps them warm in winter. In the most bitter months, the temperature is often below minus 10 and older Romanians wear rabbit or lamb skins to keep out the cold. I wondered how much higher E.ON would have to hike its prices before I slept with my daughter wrapped up in a dead rabbit. </p> <p>This summer was the first time Elena has opened up to me and talked about her life, and only now do I understand why for years she never smiled. What did she have to smile about? For most of her life she has been grindingly poor. I, on the other hand, don't even know how to play at being poor. And Dan has forgotten. Opulent living is too easily learned and too unpleasant to unpick. I can't imagine a life without choice, when Elena has rarely had a choice. She was forced into a communist block, could hardly feed her boys and spent years sitting in the cold and dark. </p> <p>For Dan and me, the opposite is true. If we really have to, we will choose between a lodger or a rented home; eat less meat or buy fewer clothes. We could even choose to switch the lights out or turn the boiler off but I know it won't come to that because our worldly wealth doesn't fit between two tea towels and it never will. Dan and I won't have to sit in the dark or the cold. Unlike Elena we are some of the lucky ones - life really could be a lot worse. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Do you have a story to tell about your life?

  "<p>Residents of Britain's most southwesterly outpost have earned the role of international soap stars. </p> <p>A weekly radio soap opera written, performed and produced by people who live on the Isles of Scilly is winning rave reviews not just on the islands and the Cornish mainland, but across the world.</p> <p>As Radio Scilly's 15-minute slice of everyday life, The Islanders, is available on the internet as well as local FM radio, aficionados from Australia to Canada are logging on to keep up with the gossip from the fantasy island of Marra. </p> <p>So successful is the soap that the comic actor Martin Clunes has agreed to join the cast for a one-off appearance next month when he is on the islands filming. If that goes well, the creators might just pluck up the courage to ask other famous visitors - Jude Law is one Hollywood star that often holidays here - if they fancy a turn. </p> <p>Just like its grander BBC rival, the Archers, the Islanders traces the ups and downs of family life, mixes comedy and drama and tries to reflect current issues. </p> <p>But unlike The Archers, the Scilly soap has to tread a delicate line between being relevant and, in a tight-knit community of 2,000 souls, not offending anyone with storylines that are too close to the bone. </p> <p>The writer Maggie Perkovic said the soap, which is recorded in a cast member's front room, would be too bland if it did not reflect real island life. </p> <p>\"I think you should bring in things gently,\" she said. \"If I think something is wrong or needs to be discussed then I don't mind putting it in. When you live on an island you have to be true to yourself.\" </p> <p>The soap began a year ago when Radio Scilly, which claims to be the world's smallest professional radio station, launched. Already controversial topics tackled include the arrival of \"incomers\" who do not grasp how life on the island works, the fight against unsympathetic developers and the tricky business of being a teenager in an isolated spot. </p> <p>The farming couple at the centre of the soap are the Higsons, played by real-life husband and wife, Tony and Deanne Dingley. \"I just play myself, really,\" said Tony. \"I think that's what most soap actors do. In real life I'm an ordinary bloke from the west Midlands and that's who I am in the soap.\"</p> <p>Away from the soap, though, Dingley is an estate agent rather than a farmer and while in The Islanders he seems to be teetering on the brink of an affair with the show's femme fatale, an incomer called \"luscious\" Louise, he insists that he would never succumb to such temptation in real life. </p> <p>Challenges lie ahead for both Dingley and his character. (Islanders die-hards should look away here.) In real life, the Dingleys are spending the winter away from the islands, so Tony's character Ben is about to fall conveniently into a coma after being trampled by his cows. \"I've been told that when I wake up my attitude is going to have changed. So I might have to start acting a bit,\" said Dingley. He also reveals - another Guardian exclusive, this - that when he wakes up from the coma the first word he utters is ... Louise.</p> <p>Gail Sibley, aka luscious Louise, harbours the suspicion that Perkovic has cast her as a newcomer because she has only been on Scilly for a mere 15 years. \"She may be having a little pop, I'm not sure,\" she said. </p> <p>Her character certainly has had her fair share of trouble, including having her hair turn green when she fell into a ditch full of pesticide and a close encounter with a bag of dead rats. </p> <p>Retired schoolteacher Richard Farr, who plays grumpy Frank Timmins, believes the soap deserves better than its Sunday afternoon billing. \"We do broadcast the damn thing at the wrong time. Everyone is out doing something then,\" he said. \"We've got more people listening to us in America and Australia than here.\" </p> <p>Peter Laverock, who produces the show, lives in fear that the many keen ornithologists who visit Scilly will spot that his birdsong sound effects have not been recorded locally. And writer Perkovic has the constant worry that she might overstep the mark and really upset someone. </p> <p>Still, more shocks are on the way. Islander Joe Brent Jr is serving in the army - Perkovic can't quite remember if he's in Iraq or Afghanistan, she's got to check. Anyway, he is going to be injured. And the global credit crunch is also going to hit Marra. \"This is a lovely place,\" said Perkovic, \"But the problems of the world do reach us. The show reflects that.\" And off she goes to remind herself just where poor Joe Brent Jr has been posted so he can meet his unpleasant fate.</p> <h2>Closet affair?</h2> <p>\"Luscious\" Louise, the island femme fatale, asks her neighbour, Ben, a farmer, to help her with a mouse she has found in her cupboard. Louise knows that Ben's wife, Hannah, is off the island. </p> <p><strong>Ben:</strong> Here I am Louise, where are you?</p> <p><strong>Louise:</strong> In the cupboard. Look, come in. Here's the torch. (Door slams) Oops, sorry, it's the draught. </p> <p><strong>Ben:</strong> Where's the torch. Right, it's not working. Did you check the batteries, Louise?</p> <p><strong>Louise:</strong> Oh, dear, I'm a fool, sorry Ben. I say, it's cosy in here, isn't it?</p> <p><strong>Ben:</strong> Behave yourself. Where did you see this mouse?</p> <p><strong>Louise:</strong> I heard a little scrabble and I'm sure I saw a ... Do you like my perfume?</p> <p><strong>Ben:</strong> Yes, it's great. Er, I mean, don't change the subject. What if Hannah came in? </p> <p><strong>Louise:</strong> She's gone to St Mary's, hasn't she?</p> <p><strong>Ben:</strong> How do you know?</p> <p><strong>Louise:</strong> She told me. It's very dark in here, isn't it? Are you scared of the dark Ben? </p> <p><strong>Ben:</strong> Louise, what are you playing at? What are you doing? </p> <p><strong>Louise:</strong> Ben, you talk too much, now come here. </p> <p>(Fade)</p>",
  "<p>Google will make its long-awaited debut in the mobile phone handset market tomorrow when it launches in New York, with its first network partner T-Mobile, the first device that runs its Android operating system.</p> <p>Called the G1, the new phone is made by Taiwan's HTC and presents a direct challenge to Apple's iPhone and the dominance of the world's largest mobile phone maker, Nokia.</p> <p>The new handset - which is likely to be characterised as the first G-phone - has a touchscreen like the iPhone but includes a slide-out Qwerty keypad. The phone has previously been referred to as the HTC Dream and the \"Kila\", the project name given by T-Mobile and a reference to the network's hope that it will prove an effective weapon against the iPhone.</p> <p>The phone is expected to go on sale in the US next month with hopes that it will be available in the UK by Christmas - depending on demand in the North American market. It is expected to cost about $199 (\u00a3108), which would put it on a par with the basic 8GB version of the iPhone sold by AT&amp;T.</p> <p>The arrival of the G1 is the latest salvo in a fight to control the software that will power the next generation of mobile phones, which can access the internet. More devices from other manufacturers will follow next year. </p> <p>When Google announced its plans for Android last year they came alongside the unveiling of the Open Handset Alliance, a consortium of mobile phone makers and networks whose stated purpose is to \"accelerate innovation in mobile and offer consumers a richer, less expensive, and better mobile experience\".</p> <p>As part of this plan, they made Android a so-called \"open platform\", which means no one is charged to use it either in a device or as a basis for writing applications. As a result, anyone can write programmes that will run on an Android phone - from maps and calendars to word-processing software and games.</p> <p>A similar developer community has already sprung up around the iPhone, whose software is controlled by Apple although anyone can write applications that will run on it. Users of the phone and the iPod Touch have downloaded the 3,000 applications available from the iTunes store more than 100m times since it opened on July 8 this year.</p> <p>But iPhone applications are only available through the iTunes store, meaning that Apple controls what is available to users. Applications for the G1 can be downloaded from anywhere, although there is talk that Google, HTC and T-Mobile will set up some sort of applications repository .</p> <p>Nokia hit back at both Android and the iPhone in June by buying out the British mobile phone software company Symbian and announcing it would make its operating system - which powers about 60% of the global \"smartphone\" market - free.</p> <p>The hope for Google is that ultimately Android will help more mobile customers get online through their mobile phone. </p> <p>For many people in the developing world, the only way they are likely to get on the web, for the foreseeable future, is through a mobile device. </p> <p>A quarter of a century on from the arrival of the personal computer there are roughly 1bn in use worldwide but that many mobile phones are sold every year. And growth in mobile usage is increasingly in the developing world, where fixed-line infrastructure is often patchy at best.</p> <p>Being the first to market will be a source of pride for HTC, the Taiwanese company known mainly as a maker of handsets that run on Microsoft's Windows Mobile operating system. </p> <p>LG and Samsung will unveil their first Google-powered mobile phones next year.</p>",
  "<p>\"Probably the worst decision I've ever witnessed in football,\" was Stephen Hunt's damning verdict. \"A strange one - I don't know what he was thinking,\" offered Hunt's brother and team-mate, Noel. \"A monumental howler,\" was Aidy Boothroyd's contribution, while the Watford midfielder John Eustace weighed in with \"shocking\", \"ridiculous\" and \"embarrassing\". It is fair to say that no one at Vicarage Road was particularly impressed with the referee Stuart Attwell and his assistant Nigel Bannister.</p> <p>Boothroyd and co were referring to the bizarre decision, 13 minutes into the game, that put Reading in front and devalued everything that followed. Stephen Hunt swung in a corner, which hit Eustace on the thighs. Noel Hunt scampered after the loose ball, attempting, unsuccessfully, to cut it back from the byline before it bobbled out of play wide of the goal. Bannister raised his flag, Attwell pointed to the six-yard line, and the teams jogged away to arrange themselves for a goal-kick.</p> <p>But the 22 players, Attwell and the 14,761 spectators inside the ground had failed to understand Bannister's signal. A brief conversation ensued between referee and assistant and, to the astonishment of all, a goal was awarded, Bannister believing the ball to have been inside the post rather than two yards outside. It was not so much an advert for the introduction of goalline technology as a rousing endorsement for regular eye tests.</p> <p>\"Everyone could see what happened,\" said Eustace, who was credited with the first own-goal of his career. \"It's a bit embarrassing. We thought he'd given a goal-kick and then it was a goal. It's ridiculous.\" Everyone was amazed by the decision.\"</p> <p>The 25-year-old Attwell became the youngest ever Premier League referee this season and the Professional Game Match Officials board (PGMO) was quick to leap to the the defence of their young charge. \"The referee has got no way of knowing for definite at the particular time whether the ball has crossed the line for a goal,\" said Paul Rejer, the assistant referees manager at the game. \"He's relying on his assistant to make that decision.\" That, though, does not excuse Attwell's failure to believe the evidence of his own eyes. </p> <p>Reading also failed to cover themselves in glory. There was an opportunity in the immediate aftermath of the phantom goal to inform the officials of their mistake, or to allow an equaliser after the restart. The failure to do so, or to show contrition after the game, was unsurprising evidence of the win-at-all-costs attitude that prevails in the game. </p> <p>\"It wasn't our mistake,\" said Stephen Hunt. \"If it happened to us, we'd have been fuming, but you have to try to control yourselves, even if you are disappointed and gutted. I was trying to claim the goal after he gave it. You can't say, 'Hold on ref, don't give us a goal'.\"</p> <p>The Watford manager refused to attach any blame to Reading's players or their manager, Steve Coppell, who also showed a lack of Corinthian spirit post-match. \"I don't expect anyone to give us any charity,\" said Boothroyd. But there is a precedent: in a Bundesliga game between Bayern Munich and Nuremberg in 1994 a linesman awarded a goal in favour of Bayern in similar circumstances. The game finished 2-1 to the Munich side, Nuremberg appealed and the game was replayed. Watford, though, have shown no inclination to follow suit. </p> <p>The goal lent the game a surreal edge, but Watford used the adversity to stoke a comeback. Tommy Smith and John-Joe O'Toole's goals, smashed in within 20 minutes of the restart, seemed set to render the officials' error irrelevant. But the award of an 87th-minute penalty to Reading that Stephen Hunt slammed home kept the spotlight on the referee. </p> <p>\"Everybody makes mistakes,\" said Stephen Hunt. \"I've seen him referee before and he's done well, but he had a bad day at the office and he'll probably be sitting at home next weekend.\" </p> <p><strong>Man of the match</strong> Scott Loach (Watford)</p> <h2><strong>Refereeing blunders</strong></h2> <p><strong>Bayern Munich v Nuremberg, Bundesliga 1994 </strong></p> <p>Bayern Munich are awarded a goal despite Thomas Helmer's shot trickling wide. Nuremberg lose 2-1, but appeal. In the replayed game Bayern win 5-0</p> <p><strong>Coventry City v Crystal Palace, First Division 1980 </strong></p> <p>Palace's Clive Allen thumps a shot into the top corner but it rebounds back off the stanchion so quickly the referee misses it and waves play on</p> <p><strong>Manchester Utd v Tottenham, Premier League 2005 </strong></p> <p>It is 0-0 and time is running out at Old Trafford when Pedro Mendes spots United's Roy Carroll off his line. Carroll claws Mendes' shot away, but only after the ball has dropped well over the line. The officials, though, fail to match Mendes' vision</p> <p><strong>Partick Thistle v Dundee United, Scottish Premier League 1993 </strong></p> <p>Paddy Connolly's shot rebounds off the bar over the line. A Partick player picks the ball up and boots it away for the kick-off. Neither a goal nor a penalty is awarded.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Tuesday September 23 2008. In the article above we said that Reading had put their faith in karma to even things out after a bizarre error of judgement by referee Stuart Attwell left them a goal down in their match against Watford. In fact it was Watford that had the decision go against them. This has been corrected. </p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown yesterday pinned hopes of reviving his premiership on a package of measures designed to tackle the economic crisis, including a drive for tighter international controls of the global money markets and a crackdown on the culture of irresponsible City bonuses.</p> <p>However, the prime minister also paved the way for higher levels of public borrowing, in breach of the Treasury's own rules, following the tumult on world markets last week.</p> <p>In his speech to the Labour party conference today, the chancellor, Alistair Darling, will promise to do \"whatever it takes\" to rectify the mistakes made by the markets, but he will make clear: \"Just as one government alone cannot combat global terrorism, just as one government alone cannot combat climate change, so one government alone cannot deal with the consequences of globalisation.\"</p> <p>Brown's plan includes:</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>A stronger international regulatory system, based around an early-warning system run by the IMF, which he will set out when he goes to New York at the end of this week.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Tighter control of \"irresponsible\" city bonuses.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>A regime of stronger intervention in the City, under the new chairman of the Financial Services Authority, Lord Adair Turner. Turner warned yesterday: \"What has gone wrong with the world's financial system is not just a few minor things and it can't be tidied up by a little more disclosure or transparency.\"</p> <p>But the prime minister also signalled that the financial crisis means Britain's debts will go higher, insisting: \"It is right to borrow at the moment. Those people who say we should be cutting public expenditure and cutting investment at the moment are wrong. In these unique circumstances, it is right to borrow and raise public expenditure.\"</p> <p>Brown and Darling will travel to Europe and the US over the next few weeks, aiming to create an international consensus for a tougher global system of regulation. Brown's aides predicted previous US and Asian resistance to his ideas would fold in face of the crisis that created near meltdown in the markets last week and has seen the US put in place a $700bn rescue package to purge the \"toxic\" debts held by banks around the world.</p> <p>Brown's team insist they are not \"ambulance-chasing\" the global crisis, but recognise that it is the single world event that can play to Brown's political strengths and allow them to mark out substantially different territory by advancing the case for a strong interventionist state, to which the Tories do not subscribe.</p> <p>Fending off continuing calls to quit from within his own ranks at party conference, Brown promised action on City bonuses, saying: \"I think there is an element of the bonus system that is unacceptable,\" and questioning rewards for short-term deals with no regard to long-term performance. </p> <p>Brown said many people had failed to \"price risk properly\", but the City now recognised that there would have to be changes in its culture and regulation. </p> <p>Darling will use his speech to conference today to say: \"I can promise you that whatever weaknesses are found in the financial system I shall take steps to deal with them, but this is a global problem and it will take global solutions, not knee-jerk reactions, but a measured response.\"</p> <p>Brown and Darling are also coming under intense pressure from ministers, MPs and trade unionists to take populist measures to clamp down on executive bonuses, or to offer a middle-class tax cut funded by a new 45% rate of tax on those earning more than \u00a3175,000 a year.</p> <p>Explicitly offering himself as the man with a special wisdom and experience to guide Britain through this crisis, Brown insisted he remained pro-market and pro-enterprise. But he disclosed he will be resubmitting proposals on international regulation when he lobbies world leaders in New York on Thursday at the UN general assembly.</p> <p>Brown wants an enhanced role for the International Monetary Fund so that it provides a better early warning system of looming crises, better cooperation between regulators and more effective cross-border regulation of multinational finance. Britain also backs calls for an International College of Regulators and reform of credit rating agencies, heavily criticised for their part in the meltdown.</p> <p>Brown told the BBC: \"I think what people haven't appreciated is we've now got global financial systems but we've only got national regulators to cover them. And I've been pressing for some years, and I wish I could have persuaded other countries to do what I wanted, and that was to create a global system of financial regulation.\"</p> <p>Turning to Britain's debts, Brown claimed: \"In the last 10 years we have reduced the share of the national debt from 44% to 37% so we are in a position to borrow, because of our good housekeeping, to take us through difficult times. </p> <p>\"Other countries are not in such a privileged position. Other countries will be running up deficits, because it is right to borrow at this time.\" </p> <p>Shadow chancellor George Osborne challenged Brown's claim to have reduced the overall level of national debt since Labour came to power in 1997. According to Office for National Statistics figures, net debt now stands at 43.3% of GDP, compared to 43.2% in May 1997, he said, adding: \"Gordon Brown's interview shows he is increasingly becoming a stranger from the political and economic truth.\"</p> <p>The fiscal crisis has dampened the simmering rebellion within Labour ranks, even though one cabinet minister said: \"Most MPs are in state of unrestrained panic at the scale of the Tory lead.\" </p> <p>Brown has also told colleagues he has not yet finally settled on a cabinet level reshuffle in the next 14 days, fearing it could be a flashpoint for a rebellion.</p> <h2>Explainer: Brown's battle for reform</h2> <p>Gordon Brown has already made two speeches on the need for reform of the global financial architecture this year: in New Delhi in January, and in Boston in April. He said yesterday he would use a visit to the United Nations in New York later this week to seek further regulation of financial markets.</p> <p>The prime minister wants to a beefed-up role for the IMF so it provides a better early-warning system of looming crises, and better cooperation between regulators, leading to more effective cross-border regulation of multinational finance. It makes sense, according to Downing Street, that regulators share information. Britain backs calls for an International College of Regulators.</p> <p>There has also been considerable European support for reform of credit ratings agencies, heavily criticised for their part in causing the meltdown. The agencies were paid by banks and other institutions to rate the complex financial derivatives market - now viewed as a dangerous conflict of interest. One option is to set up a multilateral body, funded by governments, to provide independent rating of financial products.</p> <p>The UK has had no trouble finding supporters in Europe for these ideas. Brown has spoken to Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, and Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, president of the European commission, on the need for global action, and they are in broad agreement on the need for reform. The problem has been the US; after last week, there is the sense Washington is much more willing to act.</p>",
  "<p>The US treasury is pressing Britain, Japan, Germany and other industrialised nations to copy its $700bn (\u00a3382bn) scheme to bail out the banking industry through a coordinated global plan to patch up the wounded financial system.</p> <p>A proposed state-sponsored organisation to sweep up banks' toxic mortgage debt will require funding equivalent to more than $2,000 for every American citizen. It involves raising the statutory ceiling on the United States' national debt from $10.6tn to $11.3tn.</p> <p>Henry Paulson, the US treasury secretary, said foreign banks would only be eligible for the bail-out if they had major operations in the US.</p> <p>\"I'm going to be pressing our colleagues around the world to design similar programmes for their banks and institutions,\" said Paulson during a round of interviews on Sunday. \"Our system is a global one.\"</p> <p>Congress is likely to rush Paulson's bail-out plans into law within days - although Democrats are demanding drastic cuts in Wall Street bankers' multimillion-dollar pay packages.</p> <p>The British government is reluctant to make a similar emergency intervention. In London, a Treasury spokesman said Britain was adopting different tactics, including a \u00a3100bn special liquidity scheme for banks and last week's intervention to aid Lloyds TSB's takeover of HBOS. \"We're not working on any similar plans in the UK,\" he said. \"We're talking a lot to Hank [Paulson] and his team, but different nations might do different things.\"</p> <p>Paulson's initiative is the biggest intervention in the financial markets by a US government since the Great Depression. In a document of just three pages, the US treasury has asked Congress for authority to spend up to $700bn, although officials point out that they will make some of this money back by reselling mortgage-backed securities once a degree of normality has returned to the markets.</p> <p>\"I don't like the fact that we have to do this. I hate the fact that we have to do this, but it's better than the alternatives,\" Paulson told Fox News. \"This sticks in my craw, but it is by far the least costly way to proceed for the American economy.\"</p> <p>The treasury secretary, who is a former Goldman Sachs executive, said hedge funds would not be allowed to use the facility, risking further wrath from the troubled high-risk investment funds, which are seething over a ban on short-selling in financial stocks.</p> <p>In return for the bail-out, Democrats want Wall Street to end telephone-number sized salaries for senior executives.</p> <p>\"It would be a grave mistake to say we're going to buy up the bad debt that results from the bad decisions of these people and then let them get billions of dollars on the way out,\" said Barney Frank, chairman of the House financial services committee. \"The American people don't want that to happen and it shouldn't happen.\"</p> <p>Wall Street bosses are among the top earners in US boardrooms - Goldman Sachs' chief executive, Lloyd Blankfein, took home $68.5m last year and Lehman's Richard Fuld was paid $34m.</p> <p>The bail-out gives Paulson's department sweeping powers to spend without liability to review by the courts. \"He's asking for a huge amount of power,\" Nouriel Roubini, an economist at New York University, told Bloomberg News. \"He's saying 'trust me, I'm going to do it right if you give me absolute control'. This is not a monarchy.\"</p> <p>In a reminder of the fragile state of the financial industry, a West Virginia chain, Ameribank, was seized by regulators on Friday evening. On Wall Street, Morgan Stanley continued talks about a merger with the high-street bank Wachovia, or a capital injection from the China Investment Corporation. News of the plan halted a relentless sell-off in stocks, which some believe was close to becoming a stockmarket crash. Traders in New York suggested that if unchecked, the volume of \"sell\" orders could have wiped 22% off major indices.</p> <h2>Discount dilemma</h2> <p>How much is a sub-prime mortgage worth? The US government faces a dilemma in deciding what to pay banks for their underperforming assets. Top banks have written more than $300bn off the value of their mortgage-backed securities. Even at these discounted levels, few analysts attach much credibility to banks' valuations of holdings. But if the US treasury drives too hard a bargain, it could force such banks into bankruptcy, potentially causing an outcry. Bankers say the securities are far from worthless because they are all ultimately backed by bricks and mortar but negotiations are likely to be brutal.</p>",
  "<p>MEPs will call tomorrow for EU legislation to force private equity groups and hedge funds to disclose unprecedented amounts of information about their activities.</p> <p>The demand for tougher regulation comes as private equity groups are warning that the enduring credit crunch will reduce new money inflows into their funds by up to 30% over the next two years, and mirrors a call from the UK's largest trade union, Unite, for hedge funds to be forced to demonstrate that their investment strategies are not perpetuating the current market turmoil.</p> <p>The union, which has put forward an emergency motion to the Labour party conference on the Lloyds TSB takeover of HBOS, is demanding that hedge funds be more transparent, give greater disclosure and must be subject to risk management.</p> <p>Derek Simpson, the union's joint general secretary, said: \"It is not acceptable that the privately owned investment companies, responsible for half the daily turnover of shares in the London stockmarket, are such secretive entities that have very limited public disclosure requirements.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile, the European parliament is expected to vote overwhelmingly in favour of a report by Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, president of the European Socialist party bloc, demanding what he calls \"better regulation to isolate the bad guys\".</p> <p>But the report by the former Danish premier has been significantly watered down since he originally drafted it 18 months ago at the height of public outcry over the allegedly locust-like asset-stripping and job-destroying activities of the funds.</p> <p>It now pinpoints the key role of such funds in providing capital, particularly to start-up firms and small- and medium-sized companies hit even harder than usual by the freezing of banks' lending facilities in the financial meltdown. Even so, European venture capitalists have warned that legislation could promote \"economic stagnation\".</p> <p>The proposals now cover all financial market players, not just the funds, but their provisions go substantially beyond the voluntary code of conduct for greater transparency among private equity firms that was proposed last year by Sir David Walker, the ex-Morgan Stanley executive, and endorsed by the industry.</p> <p>They include mandatory capital requirements for all financial institutions - an issue to be dealt with next month by the EU internal market commissioner, Charlie McCreevy, when he proposes a revised capital requirements directive. The funds and others would be required to disclose their leverage/debt exposure, the source and amount of funds raised, and identify larger shareholders for all investment products.</p> <p>The remuneration packages of senior executives and fund managers would have to be set out in full detail, while rewards would have to be tailored to longer-term results - losses as well as profits.</p> <p>Employees would have to be consulted during takeovers, including leveraged buyouts, measures taken to avoid \"unreasonable\" asset-stripping and excessive debt, and employees or staff representatives of pension funds to be informed on how their pensions are invested and on any risks.</p> <p>Peter Skinner, a Labour MEP and member of the European parliament's economic committee, said last night: \"Existing self-regulation attitudes are not enough to arrive at satisfactory conclusions, especially in the light of the current crisis.\" But he admitted that private equity firms could play a key role in illiquid markets. \"My fear is that this could go too far and if we bring in too much legislation we could stifle these sources of capital and dry up any liquidity.\"</p> <p>Rasmussen, in a recent interview with EurActiv, the European Union information service, admitted that his proposals would not guarantee avoiding future financial crises but insisted McCreevy had been too slow to act. He asserted that they would not undermine the City of London's role as a financial hub.</p> <h2>Short-selling row</h2> <p>The Financial Services Authority rebuffed concerns yesterday that its ban on <strong>short-selling</strong> shares in key City firms represented an unreasonable restraint on hedge funds. Several funds that have suffered <strong>losses</strong> as a result of the clampdown are understood to be looking to <strong>overturn the ruling</strong>. An FSA spokeswoman said: \"We are clear the new code provisions are both valid and <strong>necessary</strong>.\" The FSA ban was part of a worldwide effort to defend banks from short-selling, in which traders borrow shares in a company and sell them in the hope that the prices will fall. The US, France, Germany, Switzerland, Ireland and Canada's Ontario market have <strong>banned the practice</strong> and Australia, which partially banned it last week, said yesterday it would follow suit. Lord Turner, FSA chairman, said the ban had helped <strong>restore order</strong>.</p>",
  "<p>A businessman was killed and his wife critically wounded when a gunman opened fire at their isolated home in Cornwall on Saturday night, police said yesterday.</p> <p>Officers were called to the house in Porth Kea, near Truro, just before 10pm. They arrived to find Adam Hustler, 41, and his 40-year-old wife, Amanda, badly injured. Both appeared to have been shot at close range. The couple were taken to the Royal Cornwall hospital at Treliske, Truro, where Adam Hustler died.</p> <p>Amanda Hustler, who is thought to have been shot in the back, was later transferred to Derriford hospital in Plymouth, Devon, where she was said to be in a critical condition. </p> <p>At 5am on Sunday, dozens of officers - including armed police and negotiators - went to a house just outside Penzance where they arrested a 23-year-old man, believed to be the former boyfriend of one of the Hustlers' daughters, Danielle. The man, who had suffered facial injuries unconnected with his arrest, gave himself up \"without incident\". </p> <p>A gun, understood to be a .22 calibre weapon, recovered from his home is being examined by firearms experts.</p> <p>The arrested man was also taken to the Royal Cornwall hospital, where doctors were yesterday trying to assess whether he was fit to be questioned.</p> <p>Danielle Hustler and her sister were believed to be at their mother's bedside yesterday afternoon and will be interviewed by detectives later. Danielle is thought to have been at home when her parents were shot and she raised the alarm. </p> <p>A spokesman for Devon and Cornwall police said a major crime investigation team had been set up, involving around 30 officers, and the inquiry was waiting for the results of a full forensic search. A fingertip search of the murder scene was likely to take a day or two, he added.</p> <p>Hustler was the managing director of a drain-clearing business in Truro, Clear-Flow Ltd. Other members of the family were also directors of the company.</p> <p>Neighbours said yesterday that the Hustlers were a quiet and religious family who did not get involved in village activities. They are Jehovah's Witnesses.</p> <p>One neighbour said: \"I don't really know them other than to say hello to. They have been in the house for a few years, but nobody sees that much of them. It is a large house on a quiet lane leading down to a couple of farms.</p> <p>\"I only realised something was wrong when I tried to walk down there with my dogs and was turned back by the police.\"</p> <p>Another neighbour, Marie Laity, said: \"The family keep themselves to themselves and are strict Jehovah's Witnesses. It is scary to have something this shocking happen so close. It seems to have been caused by something which was personal to them, but it is still frightening.\"</p> <p>Tomas Hill, county councillor for Feock and Kea, learned of the shooting after church yesterday morning. \"Everyone is in shock,\" he said. \"It's completely unprecedented in my lifetime.\"</p> <p>Porth Kea is a hamlet of around 20 houses close to the banks of the River Fal, in an area of outstanding natural beauty. The road through the village was sealed off by police yesterday as inquiries continued.</p> <p>A tribute released through the police yesterday by Tim Mears, a representative from the Jehovah's Witnesses, described Hustler as a loving husband and father. \"The family have asked me to say that they are very shocked by these terrible and very unexpected events. Friends and family are providing loving support. </p> <p>\"Our thoughts and prayers are with Amanda, and her two daughters at this most difficult time,\" said Mears. \"Adam Hustler was a generous and caring person who thought the world of his wife and daughters. He is a great loss to all who knew him, and especially those that shared his Christian values.\"</p>",

The company will this week fly in entomologists from all over the world to discuss the issue at its technical centre in Horsham, West Sussex.</p> <p>Experts such as Professor Mike Potteran, an urban entomologist at the University of Kentucky, will be among the figures speaking in Britain but also at a series of events run by the company in France, Italy and Spain in a bid to help staff and clients cope with the bedbug infestation.</p> <p>The enormous increase in international travel as a result of rising western living standards and low-cost flying is seen as a major factor behind the revival.</p> <p>\"We think that some of the problems result from changing lifestyles: the increasing amount of foreign travellers returning home with second-hand clothes and furniture is a major source of the problem. But the banning of certain chemicals in the 1960s and 1970s around the European Union plus a general lack of awareness is also to blame,\" said Rentokil spokesman, Malcolm Padley.</p> <p>The bedbug, Cimex lectularius, hides under carpets or in headboards or skirting boards. The red or brown nocturnal creatures, which are about 5mm long and can lay up to 500 eggs in the space of two months, feed on human blood.</p> <p>Rentokil has been working on new insecticides, including the Cymexide Nano Fogger, which is being field-tested in France.</p>",
  "<p>So there's these two policemen in a room. And Bob Marley, he's there as well. \"Let me get this straight,\" says the non-moustachioed cop: \"Your defence is that you shot the sheriff ... but you did not shoot the deputy?\" \"Jah,\" says Bob Marley. And then the cop who does have a moustache says ... </p> <p>Actually it's probably worth leaving it there. \"Why Bob Marley should not have acted as his own defence attorney\" is only a 30-second sketch, so to quote any further from it might ruin the punchline. If I haven't already. Sorry.</p> <p>But the punchlines are never really the thing with Seth MacFarlane. Its imagining a situation and taking it to it's logical conclusion. What would happen when Mario finally rescued Princess Daisy at the end of a Super Mario level? Would she really fall for the charms of a small, pot-bellied plumber with no dress sense and a tragic 'tache? Or would she decline his declarations of love and then have to deal with the bitter fallout?</p> <p>The humour in MacFarlane's Cartoon Cavalcade, which launched on his YouTube channel earlier this month, will be familiar to anyone who watches his Family Guy. These tiny sketches are almost exactly the same as those moments when the Griffin family or friends mention a familiar word or pop culture phenomenon and Family Guy goes into a fantasy sequence with very little to do with the rest of the episode. So they're like those bits, just cut loose from the rest of the show; which some would argue is the best place for them.</p> <p>And with more than 3m views in the first two days since the launch, it does appear that leaving them floating around the internet suits these sketches rather well - they are a success because they're perfectly suited to the medium, but also because they're web-only. People flock to these mini-animations because they feel like a special freebie, a bonus from a familiar source. Put up a standard Family Guy episode and you wouldn't get quite the same take-up. </p> <p>The length of the sketches is also key. YouTube is made for projects such as this - well, this and videos of cats doing amusing things. The problem? Things are more difficult to sponsor in snippets on the web - although there's a whacking great advert for Burger King taking up the first 15 or 20 seconds of each Cartoon Cavalcade sketch. They have, however, been very clever: animated in the style of the rest of the cartoon, and with a changing gag each time - Simpsons-style - so that people will be watching these ads rather than just skipping through them in search of the main event.</p> <p>Getting people to actually watch adverts, even on a web series, is becoming more of an inventive game. Last week and this in the US, an entire web series called Blank Slate was also exclusively broadcast during the advert breaks of a classic Law and Order rerun on television. Every time your brain paused in watching the main show, there was a whole new story of three or four minutes to try to follow before the one you were actually intending to watch came back. </p> <p>While watching a web series online is one thing - it was a decent crime and sci-fi tale of memory replacement and such with some big names (well, Eric Stoltz, big for about three months in the early 90s) - watching an \"exclusive\" television airing, while trying to cope with two plots at the same time, proved impossible. A multitask too far.</p> <p>Given that the series ran in the ad break, it was also pretty confusing. Is it a web series or an advert? One thing cannot function as both. Especially not when you start wondering why all the high-powered agents are driving boring family estate cars. Then you realise that's the thing you should be impressed by (and buy). And then you stop caring completely.</p>",
  "<p>John McCain's campaign team has been at it. Wal-Mart was revealed as doing it. Sony in the past dabbled with it. Online, astroturfing - whereby stealth PR tactics are passed off as grassroots enthusiasm for a product or candidate - is flourishing. But in China, things have gone one step further - with the establishment of the country's 50-cent army.</p> <p>At first glance, it might not resemble the kind of fighting force likely to strike fear into the hearts of its enemies. But, aided by China's dominance of online media conversation this year, the army is rapidly assuming a formidable reputation. The premise is the same as many astroturfing projects: pay people (predominantly students) to push a certain line by posting to the many forums, blogs and bulletin boards that have proliferated in the country. The difference is that it is the government - rather than companies or campaigning groups - that is employing these estimated 300,000 \"soldiers\".</p> <p>Examples include attempts to guide domestic public debate - 50-cent posters will support speeches by Chinese leaders, for example, and were used in debate over which type of educational qualification Chinese students should be allowed to receive. But astroturfing is also used to defend China's honour abroad - when CNN's Jack Cafferty referred to the Chinese leaders as \"goons and thugs\", a number of 50-cent army posters offered up posts attacking him, and news sites reporting the Tibetan uprising earlier this year were flooded with 50-cent comments.</p> <p>According to popular lore, and a number of Chinese bloggers, each post made pays 50 Chinese cents or five mao. It is not, by any stretch of the imagination, a lucrative occupation. William Moss, an account director at the public relations agency Burson-Marsteller, calculates that a post needs to be made every four minutes during a gruelling 72-hour working week if you are hoping to earn the bare minimum wage in one of the country's bigger cities. </p> <p>\"Pocket money? Maybe. But I wouldn't plan on sending the kids to college that way,\" says Moss. </p> <p>Hong Kong blogger Oiwan Lam, who helped expose the issue thanks to her links with the mainland's online community, believes that China's 50-cent army is probably motivated by a combination of commerce and nationalism.</p> <p>\"If you really post frequently you can earn something,\" says Lam. \"But it could be a combination of economic gain and political responsibility.\"</p> <p>In this regard, the campaign is not all that different from some of the political techniques utilised outside China. McCain's presidential campaign recently attracted criticism when it emerged that volunteers were being offered prizes in exchange for seeding comments and messages supplied to them. The rewards on offer - books signed by McCain, a ride with the candidate on his campaign bus - tap into the mix of profit and politics alluded to by Lam. </p> <p>While astroturfing is seen by some as ethically dubious, it is still growing in popularity, thanks, in part, to the ease with which web 2.0 technologies - the likes of Twitter, Wikipedia and YouTube all feature heavily - can be employed to sway public opinion using the elusive power of word-of-mouth marketing. \"Astroturfing happens because people instinctively assign different levels of credibility to different sources of information,\" says Moss. \"Individuals or groups that have a vested interest in your opinion are generally less credible, those that don't are more credible. True word-of-mouth or buzz is very powerful for that reason, and organisations will work very hard to cultivate it.\"</p> <p>Certainly Wal-Mart and its PR agency Edelman thought that buzz was worth capturing when they created a front organisation called Working Families for Wal-Mart, funding a fake travel blog that pushed an overtly pro-Wal-Mart message. And then got found out. Edelman representatives were unwilling to comment.</p> <p>However, astroturfing remains firmly in vogue, according to one source at a London PR firm. In the gaming arena, for example, pro-Microsoft comments are regularly attributed to astroturfers, while other companies exposed for employing the tactic in one form or another include Sony, L'Or\u00e9al and ExxonMobil.</p> <p>The payment model for corporate astroturfers is often similar to that for China's 50-cent army - although the figures involved are rather more healthy, with astroturfers for corporations able to make a decent living. \"Many purported social media experts have figured out how to manipulate social networks instead of genuinely participating in them,\" says Brian Solis, the founder of FutureWorks PR. \"There are new media consultants and agencies that are employed to do this and other forms of comment, voting, and promotional marketing.\" The challenge lies in actually tracking down a real-life astroturfer, or even the companies that employ them. Bloggers and posters are bound by confidentiality, while few agencies appear willing to admit that they condone, let alone participate in, the practice. </p> <p>Calley Nye, a viral marketing consultant, who often adopts the online moniker Silicon Calley, says: \"I have in the past hired people to astroturf, but always temporarily. If you leave the same people in for too long, they get too obvious and it's easy to get someone to do it for like a week.\"</p> <p>Nye refuses to name her clients - \"it would kind of defeat the purpose, if everyone knew it was fake\" - but rather casually touts a figure of $100 for two hours work which, at least, sounds rather more promising than the Chinese government's modest payments. </p> <p>Then there is PayPerPost.com, which the Center for Media and Democracy (CMD) - a not-for-profit organisation that aims to strengthen \"participatory democracy by investigating and exposing public relations spin and propaganda\" - points to as a pervasive form of online promotion. The website links paying companies with bloggers who are paid to promote their products but, however, insists on full disclosure within the post. The minimum fee suggested for a post, $5, is hardly riches, but the site's top-ranked blogger pulled in $4,000 last month.</p> <p>Paul Denlinger, an independent business consultant based in Beijing, also sees financial rewards from astroturfing, pointing out that IT hardware brands in China regularly pay decent sums in return for gamers pushing their products online.</p> <p>\"There are companies that act as middlemen between the big makers and some of the gaming companies,\" he says. \"They have people who work the bulletin boards, and they pay people who are very dedicated gamers. Some of them can certainly make a living off this kind of thing.\"</p> <p>Another PR source points out that, despite the obvious risk of being exposed, the \"potential upside\" of astroturfing means that there will always be organisations willing to take a chance. \"But any time you play fast-and-loose with transparency you risk your reputation.\"</p> <p>This risk may be the only thing that gives corporations pause, given the state of anti-astroturfing regulation. According to CMD senior researcher Diane Farsetta, professional PR bodies have ethics codes that \"look good on paper\". \"However, those ethics policies are never enforced by, for example, rescinding the membership of professionals or firms that break them, even if they break them repeatedly.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, US legislation to limit astroturfing was shelved last year. An EU directive which was incorporated by the UK earlier this year does outlaw many astroturfing techniques, but doubts persist over whether trading standards officers will have the resources to comprehensively enforce it.</p>",
  "<p>Rising choreographer Emanuel Gat trained as a conductor before turning to dance. Oddly, his background shows most clearly in Silent Ballet, a work performed virtually without music. Although there are just eight dancers on stage, the way Gat coordinates them has an almost orchestral feel. </p> <p>Individuals and small groups are highlighted with a colour and precision that evoke the contrasting effects of different instruments. A taut ensemble of small, nervy steps and weaving arms suggests the high pitch of violins; a couple crossing the space in a low, prowling walk become a darkly vibrating bassline. Even though Gat's choreography can be spare to the point of minimal, the overall impression is fascinatingly rich. </p> <p>In Winter Voyage, we get to hear as well as see Gat's musical sensibility. Set to three songs from Schubert's Winterreise, this male duet has Gat and fellow dancer Roy Assaf tracking the stage in running, spinning lines. When they intersect, the choreography dovetails in beautifully shaped phrases, a mix of pulsing curves and rhythmically finessed gestures that shimmer in and out of harmony with the music. As dance, it is superbly crafted, but it also has an undertow of sexual obsession, loneliness and unexpected delicacy. </p> <p>Sadly, it is much harder to love Through the Centre, unless you also love the musician Squarepusher. There are long stretches of mad, navel-gazing noise in the tracks accompanying this piece, and what makes them extra irksome is that they emphasise the one tendency in Gat I don't like. His choreography relies too much on introvert, close-to-the body movement, which can veer towards the tense and inconclusive. Set to Squarepusher's music, the choreography starts to look like neurotic noodling. It undermines an evening that is otherwise so charged with promise.</p>",
  "<p>This fixture is an exercise in time travel. We may only be in late September, but both teams displayed the desperate ambition of men playing as if the title hung in the balance with just a few seconds left of the last fixture. Judging by the unyielding determination, these sides may be locked together once again in May. </p> <p>If it puts a terrible strain on United and Chelsea their suffering will be a spectacle to engross the rest of us. Here, the Stamford Bridge side held on to an intangible honour of profound importance. The unbeaten record at home in the Premier League now stands at 85 fixtures. While life had its travails for each team, Chelsea, in particular, were confronted by adversity.</p> <p>Deco, who sets the side's tempo, picked up an adductor muscle injury in the warm-up and Ricardo Carvalho lasted a paltry 12 minutes before a knee problem ended his afternoon. The club seemed to be stripped of its right to sympathy on the day it became part of Roman Abramovich's portfolio, but money did not buy the searing pride that this squad possesses.</p> <p>There were excellent prospects for United, especially once they were ahead. Chelsea, of necessity, had a semi-fit Michael Ballack on the pitch for 75 minutes and Didier Drogba, who is to yet recover peak condition, in action from very early in the second half. The visitors appeared ready to take full advantage.</p> <p>They may not have been at full strength but the selection of Jonny Evans at centre-half for the suspended Nemanja Vidic did not enfeeble them. Their plan, predictable as it had been, troubled Chelsea deeply before the interval when Luiz Felipe Scolari's adventurous full-backs were pinned down by wide midfielders.</p> <p>All of that could have been anticipated, and the side could not hit a rhythm when it went through the centre. For a spell, Chelsea were ill at ease. Sir Alex Ferguson had the footballers to prey on that and Jose Bosingwa's lack of trenchancy was exposed at the opener. The Portugal international, who loves to race down the wing, was overwhelmed in the 18th minute.</p> <p>Patrice Evra flicked the ball inside to Dimitar Berbatov before having an excellent pass placed in front of him by Wayne Rooney. Bosingwa was too meek to halt the Frenchman. Evra put the ball in front of Berbatov and although his attempt was poor Petr Cech did not hold the shot and Park Ji-sung tucked away the loose ball.</p> <p>By then there had nevertheless been signs that United were not watertight either, but Joe Cole missed the target when through on goal following a Nicolas Anelka flick. Ferguson's side were short of composure, with three of their seven bookings imposed for dissent. A \u00a325,000 fine is automatic once a team reaches half a dozen cautions, but the real punishment for poor temperament is much more painful than that.</p> <p>United, initially dominant, could not consolidate. There were distractions, such as the knee injury that forced the goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar to make way for Tomasz Kuszczak, but United should have been more ruthless. In the second half, with Cristiano Ronaldo introduced, the conservative plan appeared to be to hit on the break.</p> <p>If that strategy was meant to prey on Chelsea's nerves it was a lamentable failure. Any anxiety that Scolari's players were experiencing was self-inflicted. After 66 minutes, for instance, Joe Cole blasted at the chest of Kuszczak when the angle made it rash to shoot rather than pass.</p> <p>The principal danger for Chelsea was of despair taking hold. Most sides would have surrendered to gloom after the sort of opportunity that was squandered in the 73rd minute, when Joe Cole droved in the perfect low ball and Anelka let it fly through his legs. As it turned out, United's organisation failed before Chelsea's morale could collapse.</p> <p>Rooney gave away a foul in the 79th minute. Mikel John Obi, shorn of the poise he has been showing against inferior opponents, had sufficient morale left to hit a fine free-kick. Kuszczak stayed on his line and no one marked the substitute Salomon Kalou, who headed into the corner of the net.</p> <p>A little earlier Rooney had been unable to squeeze a finish into the small gap at the post following a cut-back from Ronaldo. By such fine margins United failed to storm the Stamford Bridge citadel. They would not have deserved the conquest. The prize they did bear away with them was the result that keeps them within six points of Chelsea. Irrespective of the league position, it is not such a dreadful state of affairs when it is remembered that away fixtures at Fratton Park and Anfield have already been ticked off.</p> <p>There was a disconcerting end to this game that might have done harm to United. With added time drawing to a close, Rio Ferdinand seemed to foul Drogba and, with a caution to his name already, might have been sent off. Debate over the rights and wrongs of that were forestalled when it emerged that the referee, Mike Riley, had blown the final whistle. There was a confusing scene but it still made perfect sense that these sides should divide the spoils.</p> <p><strong>Man of the match </strong>Wayne Rooney (Manchester United)</p>",
  "<p>Eddie Jones and Jonny Wilkinson renewed old acquaintances yesterday and the outcome was almost embarrassingly lop-sided. Wilkinson may have been responsible for the biggest disappointment of Jones's career in the 2003 World Cup final, but the former Australia coach has since claimed retribution having helped both South Africa and Saracens to neuter the world's most prolific boot in the past year. </p> <p>The home side were so dominant that Wilkinson was not granted a kick at goal until the 75th minute when he converted his own try, one of two scored by the visitors with the game long gone. By then Sarries had already rattled up five second-half tries to register their first league win in three attempts this season and were the length of the M1 ahead in terms of thought and deed, with Steve Borthwick leading from the front and Kameli Ratuvou setting up Kevin Sorrell for an early contender for try of the season.</p> <p>In fairness to Wilkinson, the shaggy-haired stand-off was often the only thing standing between Saracens and a 60-point romp. His sprint and clawing tackle from behind on Ratuvou to deny the Fijian winger another spectacular try was an impressive vindication of his current fitness and his defensive work was of the highest order. The bad news from Newcastle's perspective was that he was required to do a mountain of it.</p> <p>The contest, if that is the right word, was over long before the skipper Phil Dowson and his back-row colleague Ed Williamson were sin-binned within a minute of each other for professional fouls at defensive rucks.</p> <p>Saracens did not exactly run riot in the first half but Borthwick and Hugh Vyvyan played havoc with their opponent's line-out and the Falcons were barely sighted as an attacking force, allowing Glen Jackson to punish an assortment of indiscretions with four penalties and a neat drop-goal.</p> <p>Having lost both their opening two games by three points, Saracens could not afford to sit back. They needed a little help for their first try, created by Chris Jack's deft chip down the left touchline and Ratuvou's chargedown of Tom May's attempted clearance, but the second was a distillation of high-class skills. From beneath his own posts Jackson spotted Ratuvou out wide and delivered an angled punt which the winger rose to catch before outwitting the cover and slipping an inside scoring pass to the alert Sorrell.</p> <p>With the 13-man Newcastle scrum in disarray, Vyvyan added a third against his former club before a 70-metre burst from Neil De Kock was rewarded when the scrum-half found the supporting Rodd Penney with an inch-perfect inside ball. By the time the replacement fly-half Gordon Ross jinked over, it was merely a question of whether Newcastle would fold completely.</p> <p>\"When we had 13 guys on the field it was fingers in dykes really,\" said their director of rugby, Steve Bates. His primary concern, though, was his team's lack of set-piece impact in the first half, something which needs to be addressed at home to bottom-placed Bristol on Friday.</p> <p>Saracens will now hope this is a prelude to a more consistently rewarding season. Among other summer changes, they have hired the renowned kicking coach Dave Alred and recruited new cheerleaders, whose leg action Alred is probably already addressing. Behind the scenes they have also welcomed some heavy-hitting South African investors on to the board of directors, whose ranks now include the former Springbok legends Francois Pienaar and Morn\u00e9 du Plessis. There is no desire, as the chairman, Nigel Wray, emphasised yesterday, to think small as professional club rugby prepares for the next stage of its development. </p> <p>\"There is no doubt in my mind that, whether we like it or not, rugby will go the same way as soccer,\" predicted Wray. \"That means very simply that you will need substantial resources to play at the top table and if you're not at the top table you're probably nowhere. We don't want to be nearly men and we don't want to use the words 'should' or 'if.'\"</p> <p>In that regard they have the perfect coach for the job. Jones relishes the technical challenge thrown up by the experimental law variations - if not the ELVs themselves - and his emphasis on footballing back-rowers in the shape of Jack, the converted All Black lock, and Michael Owen is not distracting his side from their chief priorities. \"We want to be a side that can play at the highest level,\" he said. \"To do that under the current ELVs you have to be in control of certain areas, namely the set-piece and defence.\" </p> <p>Bates was certainly impressed - \"they're a good side with a lot of good players\" - but Newcastle, on this evidence, will settle merely for retaining their Premiership status, particularly with Wilkinson due to be away on England duty for a large chunk of the season. Yesterday someone mischievously asked Jones where he would be if Wilkinson had not slotted a certain drop-goal in Sydney five years ago. \"I'd be a knight, wouldn't I?\" retorted the coach, sharp as ever. He always enjoys having the last laugh. </p> <p><strong>Saracens</strong> Haughton (Wyles, 61); Penney, Sorrell, Powell, Ratuvou; Jackson (Ross, 67), De Kock (Rauluni, 67); Aguero, Ongaro (Cairns, 61), Johnston (Visagie, 61), Borthwick (capt), Vyvyan (Chesney, 61), Jack, Saull (Skirving, 55), Owen.</p> <p><strong>Tries</strong> Ratuvou, Sorrell, Vyvyan, Penney, Ross. <br><strong>Cons</strong> Jackson. <strong>Pens </strong> Jackson 4. <strong>Drop-goal</strong> Jackson. </p> <p><strong>Newcastle </strong>Tait (Phillips, 17); May, Noon, Davey, Rudd; Wilkinson, Grindal (Charlton, 62); Ward, Long (Thompson, 55), Hayman, Perry (Buist, 46), Soreson, Balding (Swinson, 74), Williamson, Dowson.</p> <p><strong>Tries </strong>Wilkinson, May. <strong>Cons</strong> Wilkinson 2.</p> <p><strong>Sin-bin</strong> Dowson 58, Williamson, 59. </p> <p><strong>Referee</strong> D Richards (Berkshire). <strong>Attendance</strong> 8,139.</p>",
  "<p>Will Young raises his eyebrows conspiratorially. He's talking about his new album and he knows he isn't supposed to say this sort of thing. \"I was dreading doing it,\" he says. \"I've had a few dark nights. I'm a bit worried about the title, too. You know, Let It Go. It sounds a bit like a self-help book. With me, Dr Young!\" He laughs, tucking his tight trousers under himself as his mood quickly changes. \"But what's in it - I love it. I know it sounds ridiculous, but I've finally got comfortable with what I do really well.\" He takes a sip from a lime-spiked bottle of lager. </p> <p>Young turns 30 in January and, despite his current cheer, it's obvious that the odd coming-of-age crisis has nipped at his heels. His new album is a masterclass in grown-up soul-pop, delivered in a vocal full of heart and personality, but songs called Tell Me the Worst and If Love Equals Nothing hint at other, less joyful stories. And then there's the chorus from Changes, the album's melancholy first single: \"Been out of luck/ For so long/ And I don't get much/ So there's nothing much to lose.\"</p> <p>These songs do have some personal resonance, Young admits. There is his break-up with a long-term boyfriend (the two are now on good terms), but there is also the sense that Young is growing up, reflecting on the peculiar beginnings of his career and realising how he can transcend them and become an artist in his own right. \"Yes, that's pretty spot-on,\" he agrees. \"Although Pop Idol was wonderful for me. I could never knock it.\"</p> <p>Young was always an unusual talent-show winner. He turned 23 during Pop Idol, famously sparred with Simon Cowell, and looked like a worldly-wise adult next to the other finalist, the baby-faced teenager Gareth Gates. Everyone expected Gates to win. He was conventionally cute and had overcome a stutter; his was a great tabloid story. When Young won, it was a shock. </p> <p>\"Looking back, it's all quite weird,\" says Young. \"When I started at the auditions, I just thought of it as another way in.\" He had already worked for Sony Music Publishing to try to get his foot in the door. And when Pop Idol started, he had just begun a three-year musical theatre scholarship at London's Arts Educational School, straight after getting his 2.2 in politics from Exeter University.</p> <p>\"Then everything changed,\" he says. \"I was a 23-year-old student with \u00a320,000 worth of loans, who suddenly got a wodge of cash, a record contract and a business. I had to get to grips with a machine and take control of it.\" Other people would have left the business concerns to the management, wouldn't they? Young's eyes fix me keenly. \"Not me. I knew Pop Idol was a means to an end and I had to take the reins. I was determined to have a career, and that kept me going.\"</p> <p>Young knew, too, that success did not mean that every door was suddenly open. Glastonbury was a case in point: \"I couldn't just expect to waltz into a festival back then and go, 'Oh, hello, it's me from the telly,' could I? You've got to work. You've got to earn it.\" And earn it he did, finally playing Glastonbury this summer, as well as T in the Park. It was clearly quite a landmark for him and he was delighted to see fields of \"drunk, blokey men\" singing along to songs like his 2003 No 1, Leave Right Now. </p> <p>Barely a month after his double A-side debut single, Evergreen/Anything Is Possible, hit No 1, Young also came out publicly. At the time, he said: \"For me it's normal and nothing to be ashamed about. I'm gay and I'm comfortable with that.\" Given the sanitised genre in which he operated - and his core audience of teenage girls and their mothers - it was a bold move, but, thankfully, one that had no effect on his career. Coming six months after the openly gay Brian Dowling won the second series of Big Brother, it also suggested the general public are no longer terribly troubled by their reality heroes' sexual preferences.</p> <p>Did he feel like he did something special by coming out so frankly? \"Oh shit, no, I'm the worst gay person ever!\" Young cackles. \"If it helped some people, then great. Thing is, though, I never wanted to be in a box. I still don't. I mean, if an issue is prevalent, then I'm happy to make a comment about being gay, middle-class, or a singer, whatever. It's not like I'm a big gay campaigner picking up my mantle and charging towards Soho.\"</p> <p>Nevertheless, last year Young wrote an elegant response to a Matthew Parris column in the Times, in which Parris told his \"fellow-queers\" to remember that \"there has been no better, luckier, time or place to be gay than Britain in 2007\". Young agreed with his point, but also described his own experiences of homophobia, drew attention to the invisibility of gay sportsmen and actors, and talked about how homosexuality still had to be equated with normality. Or, as he put it: \"Coming out should just be a statement of fact - I have red hair, I drink tea, I sleep with the same sex.\"</p> <p>Were you proud of the piece? \"I was. Because I did agree that things were good for us, but ... the very fact that we're talking about me being gay now says everything, doesn't it?\" He smiles cheekily. \"Matthew wrote a very charming letter to me afterwards. We were just like two academics sparring across our periodicals.\" </p> <p>Young also wrote a piece for this paper, about being nominated for both the Brits and the Baftas in early 2006. The Bafta nod came for his role in the Judi Dench-helmed musical, Mrs Henderson Presents. Then, in 2007, came something he had always craved: his first role in theatre. Young spent four months playing Nicky Lancaster, the protagonist of Noel Coward's 1924 play The Vortex, at Manchester's Royal Exchange. The London Evening Standard's theatre critic, Nicholas de Jongh, loved his performance, saying it had \"taken more than 80 years and the performance of Will Young ... to bring out the full truth about Nicky Lancaster\".</p> <p>Young is clearly energised when talking about that time, though he adds: \"It was shit-scary - living in Manchester on my own, constantly conscious of what people thought of me getting the role. And being angry eight times a week. My friends said I looked like shit.\" He hasn't had any roles since, and worries that it's because of people's prejudices. \"But if I have to graft like I did with my singing, I will.\"</p> <p>The toughest thing Young has had to deal with in recent years, however, concerned the mental health problems of his twin brother, Rupert. A constant presence during the Pop Idol tryouts, Rupert grappled with alcoholism and self-abuse, even slitting his wrists during the auditions. In 2005, he was diagnosed with dysthamia, a depressive disorder triggered by trauma, and since then has set up the Mood Foundation, which provides mental health treatment for the less financially sound.</p> <p>\"I'm so proud of him,\" says Young. \"It's been so fucking hard seeing someone you adored being so very unhappy, trying to reach out, them not letting you in.\" He had to cut the strings a few years after he got famous, which was particularly hard given the differences in their lots. Did he feel guilty? \"Of course I did. But it got to the stage that I was like, no, I can't feel guilty about it. Because I loved him to death, but I had to wait for him to help himself.\"</p> <p>Young is still angry about the mistreatment of depression in this country, though.

  "<p>Given Labour's position in the polls, you may throw up your hands in disgust at the notion that the party can gain anything from blogging. A Fabian debate today revealed just how resistant the party hierarchy is to letting the grassroots help set the agenda. But that will have to change if Labour is to have a chance of winning the next election.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.labourhome.org/\">LabourHome</a> wants to be the meeting point for grassroots Labour members and the party's upper hierarachy. I would like my site, <a href=\"http://www.liberalconspiracy.org/\">Liberal Conspiracy</a>, to be the hub for liberal-left activism, campaigning and ideas. One is focused directly on a party, the other on a broader ideas movement. No doubt there are tensions, but they come primarily from how we, the bloggers and activists, relate to political parties themselves. While Barack Obama posts articles directly to <a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com/\">Daily Kos</a> and <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/\">Huffington Post</a>, over here the Labour party is still very intent on controlling the message and its delivery.</p> <p>And this is why both the upper echelons of Labour and the Conservatives are wary about LabourHome and <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/\">ConservativeHome</a> respectively \u2013 because they still operate under the old rules, where the top-down approach of controlling the party and its message is paramount.</p> <p>I operate under an entirely different set of assumptions. We are now living in an era where people want more accountability and responsiveness from their elected officials. They are put off politics because they find it too Westminster-focused or irrelevant to their lives. They find the whole system difficult to decipher. In other words, they want more control, and want to engage with others who feel the same. I don't mean the vast majority of the electorate, but a significant portion, who are passionate about the direction their country is taking and want to play a part in shaping it.</p> <p>The question is \u2013 can blogs be part of that? Possibly. As the older ways of connecting people along ideological lines become less relevant, such as trade unions, people want new ways of getting involved in the political process. This isn't necessarily an apathetic generation. But it is a demoralised one that needs to see new ways of getting politics to work. Blogging can be part of that, if done right. </p> <p>The Labour hierarchy doesn't seem to get it. Panellist Derek Draper, who is currently advising the party on communications, made it clear that he is more focused on discipline and the right message than he is about involving the party political base. But who will knock on doors and evangelise for Labour in the heartlands, if not the party faithful? The only way Labour will embrace blogging and the new grassroots is if it is out of power and needs to reach out again to build an election winning coalition. By 2010, it will be too late \u2013 the party is not willing to be radical enough to win the next election. </p> <p>But for me and my fellow Liberal Conspirators, the mission is simple. We have to have a vision of where the liberal-left wants to go. We need new ideas and new mission statements, because the left has been attached to dogmatic positions for too long. And then we need to campaign to further a liberal-left set of ideas that chime with what Britain wants and where we want to go. </p> <p>That could mean actively campaigning and fund-raising for progressive candidates \u2013 whether they belong to Labour, the Lib Dems or the Green party. Whether this happens with or without the support of New Labour is irrelevant. A huge portion of the electorate is left-leaning and wants to see a better country. It's now up to blogs to provide them an outlet for that frustration and energy.<br></p>",
  "<p>I haven't read Joseph Conrad's Typhoon and so I didn't know what Gordon Brown was on about this morning when he said that his approach to the global economic crisis would emulate the stance of a famous Conrad character. But Andrew Marr has read everything and so he instantly recognised a reference to Captain MacWhirr.</p> <p>For the record, according to <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/andrew_marr_show/7627906.stm\">the BBC transcript,</a> this is what Brown said:</p> <blockquote> <p>We're a team and we're facing difficult work conditions and facing them in a way that we ensure that people will come through this fairly. You know I think Joseph Conrad was the author, and when he said when you're facing a storm and it's an economic storm, an international storm, what do you do? The best way to deal with that storm is, he said, facing it, facing it. I think all the cabinet and all the government are of the same mind.</p> </blockquote> <p>That sounds fine. But a quick check suggests that Brown could have named a more suitable literary role model.</p> <p>MacWhirr is the captain of a ship who, when he encounters bad weather, stubbornly refuses to take avoiding action and instead sails straight into the eye of the storm. In the end the ship and its passengers survive, partly as a result of MacWhirr's solid leadership. But he's also described as \"having just enough imagination to carry him through each successive day, and no more\" and Conrad suggests that a more flexible captain would never have sailed into the storm in the first place.</p> <p>Brown was mocked recently when he allowed an interviewer to let him identify himself with Heathcliff. I'm not sure the Labour party will find his latest literary hero any more reassuring.</p>",
  "<p>Kerb-crawling and soliciting for prostitutes on the streets are to be<br>outlawed as part of a wide ranging tightening of the law, the home secretary Jacqui Smith annnounced today.</p> <p>Warning of the \"blight\" of prostitution, Smith outlined a three-point plan at the Labour conference. It will:</p> <p>\u00b7 Remove the requirement that only persistent kerb-crawlers and men who solicit for sex on the street can be prosecuted. An alternative requirement for kerb-crawlers -- that they act \"in a manner that is likely to cause annoyance to people in the neighbourhood\" -- is also to be removed. The changes will mean that kerb-crawlers and would-be punters on the street can be prosecuted after a first offence</p> <p>\u00b7 Give new powers to councils and the police to close down brothels for at least three months if prostitutes are being run by a pimp or have been trafficked. At the moment police can only close brothels if there is anti-social behaviour and if Class A drugs are involved</p> <p>\u00b7 Change the law so that men can be prosecuted if they pay for sex with a woman who is being exploited \u2013 defined by Smith as \"controlled for another person's gain\". Police are only able to pursue a prosecution if they can prove the women did not consent to sex ie rape.</p> <p>The home secretary also announced that communities will be given a greater say in stopping lap-dancing clubs opening in their areas. Smith criticised the Tories for sending delegates to their conference in Birmingham next week a \u00a310 voucher to visit such a club. \"I want to know what the Tories have to say for themselves,\" she said.</p> <p>Smith announced the new measures on prostitution after a six-month government review into prostitution which focused on how Sweden and the Netherlands deal with the problem.</p> <p>\"We will do more to tackle the blight of street prostitution,\" Smith told the Labour conference in Manchester. \"At the moment only persistent kerb-crawling is outlawed. In my book, once around the block is once too many -- and so we'll make kerb-crawling punishable as a first offence.\"</p> <p>The government will also toughen the law to prosecute men who pay for sex with women run by a pimp or who have been trafficked. Harriet Harman. Labour's deputy leader who is also equality minister, said: \"We must protect women from being victims of human trafficking _ the modern slave trade. The trade only exists because men buy sex, so to protect women we must stop men buying sex from the victims of human trafficking.\"</p> <p>Labour focused the first full day of its conference on crime and the law.</p> <p>Jack Straw, the justice secretary, announced a crackdown on the<br>\"scandalous\" behaviour of \"no win, no fee\" lawyers, who have ramped up their fees in recent years, and on legal aid solicitors.</p> <p>\"I am concerned about 'no win no fee' arrangements,\" Straw said. \"It's claimed they have provided greater access to justice but the behaviour of some lawyers in ramping up their fees in these cases is nothing short of scandalous.</p> <p>\"So I am going to address this and consider whether to cap more tightly the level of success fees that lawyers can charge.\"</p> <p>Turning his attention to legal aid lawyers -- more money is spent on legal aid in England and Wales than anywhere else in the world -- Straw said: \"There are now three times as many lawyers in private practice but paid for by the taxpayer as there were three decades ago; the budget has grown faster than the health and education services.</p> <p>\"The challenge now is how better to spend these huge sums in the interests of justice; something I want to do with the legal profession and local government.\"</p> <p>Straw's crackdown on lawyers is part of a campaign to open up the justice system as he strives to lift the \"veil\" on justice. \"It's about a change of culture, of attitude, about lifting the veil which sometimes keeps justice from view,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>I worked in the Square Mile for three and half years at an international City law firm. I spent many hours slaving away, day and night, bleary eyed, on multi-million pound takeovers, mergers and acquisitions, and the rest. It could sound glamorous (especially when it involved overseas travel) but often it wasn't partly because, as a lawyer, you were not the one calling the shots. More often than not it was the very well renumerated bankers on so-called \"bulge bracket\" deals - the Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynchs of this world.</p> <p>The very mention of these Goliaths' names commanded respect and awe in equal measure in the City and on Wall Street. Successive occupants of 11 Downing Street have courted them vociferously; their neighbours in Number 10 have done too. It was not for nothing that they came to be known as the \"Masters of the Universe\". And then last week came along and smashed that all apart.</p> <p>The wheeling and dealing, clever trading, short selling, and sheer greed which brought about the current <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/creditcrunch\">economic turmoil</a> got the better of them. Lehmans and Merrills have been wiped off the face of the earth \u2013 players no more. The mighty Goldmans reported a 70% fall in third quarter earnings. AIG, the world's biggest insurer, has been effectively nationalised by that well-known socialist, George Bush!</p> <p>If ever there was a time for the centre left \u2013 people who believe in capital markets but regulated to serve the interests of us all \u2013 to grab the moment, the time is now. As Ed Miliband, bona fide member of the Brown inner circle, said last night at a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/21/labourconference.labour\">rally</a> organised by Compass, now is not the time for caution; now is the time to be bold, and that is what we want to see in Gordon Brown's conference speech on Tuesday.</p> <p>Historically the prime minister has been nervous about taking on the vested interests of the City and the super rich. Now is the moment to do so and restate whose side he is on. A good start has been made by banning the short selling of stock, but we must go further. It comes to something when the hedge fund doyenne (and \"supermum\"), Nicola Horlick, speaking on Newsnight last week, admitted that her particular sector can more or less do as it pleases and needs more regulation and supervision. But what would better regulated financial services look like? Gordon needs to tell us.</p> <p>Next, let's take the opportunity to re-examine the tax system. At the same Compass rally, the Labour backbencher and former Labour deputy leadership candidate, Jon Cruddas, at the same Compass rally proposed introducing a new top rate of income tax of 45% on those earning more than \u00a3175,000 and using the proceeds to take nearly 600,000 middle income earners who have found themselves creeping into the current higher tax band, out of that bracket \u2013 a neat way of showing continued delivery for Middle England.</p> <p>For lower income earners, let's levy a windfall tax and use the proceeds to provide Labour's core vote with a generous winter fuel allowance \u2013it is not a panacea, but it will help keep people warm this winter. The government plans to provide <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/12/labour.energy1\">free insulation</a> for those on benefits and the over-70s are excellent (and will delight people in communities like mine in Streatham, which contains some of the poorest estates in the country) but they will take time to work through, and bitter cold winters wait for no one.</p> <p>Then perhaps Gordon would care to say something about wages. The mantra is that public sector pay must be kept under control to curb inflationary pressures, but what about the responsibilities of others, like the country's FTSE 100 chief executives, to exercise similar restraint? The PM need not pledge to do anything about this but to hear him touch on it would be nice. What he could pledge to do is introduce living wage clauses in public sector contracts.</p> <p>I could go on. The point is that this son of the manse went into politics to change things \u2013 if not change now, then when? Go on Gordon, now is the moment.</p>",
  "<p>Salomon Kalou struck 10 minutes from time to cancel out Park Ji-Sung's first-half effort as Chelsea came from behind to earn a point in an engaging 1-1 draw against Manchester United at Stamford Bridge.</p> <p>In an open encounter dominated before the break by the champions and thereafter by the hosts, a draw was a fitting result as Chelsea's relentless pressure finally paid off with Kalou's late header. Park's goal had given United the lead in a first-half in which the Blues looked subdued, in part due to the loss to injury of Portuguese pair Deco and Ricardo Carvalho, but largely as a result of United's greater enterprise.</p> <p>One glance at United's bench appeared to suggest that Sir Alex Ferguson had come to west London in search of a draw. Cristiano Ronaldo, Carlos Tevez, Nani, and Ryan Giggs were all left out, with even Gary Neville earning a long-awaited return to Premier League action, at the expense of Wes Brown, presumably to guide Jonny Evans through his paces in a high-pressure challenge the visitors had to meet without the suspended Nemanja Vidic.</p> <p>If Ferguson was keeping his powder dry by choice, his opposite number Luiz Felipe Scolari's only change before kick-off was forced upon him. The Portuguese had named an unchanged lineup for the third successive match until Deco succumbed to injury in the warm-up. Michael Ballack, the man who scored twice in the 2-1 defeat of the champions last April, stepped into midfield.</p> <p>Whether or not Deco's absence confused Chelsea is unclear but they were certainly second best for most of the first half. United began the match with far greater promise and purpose, Darren Fletcher angling a shot wide of the far post as early as the fifth minute following good work by Owen Hargreaves down the right flank. Three minutes later and Dimitar Berbatov's ambitious first-time shot from 40-plus yards, following a sloppy clearance from Petr Cech, was poorly struck but Wayne Rooney's improvised volley looped just wide of goal with the goalkeeper beaten.</p> <p>Within seconds Chelsea should have scored, Nicolas Anelka flicking a long ball into the path of Joe Cole, who surged past the prone Patrice Evra only to send his shot into the side-netting. Worse was to follow for the hosts as Carvalho came off with suspected knee ligament damage on 12 minutes. A strangely misshapen and panicked Chelsea side continued to back off and had to be grateful to Cech for denying Rio Ferdinand with an outstretched foot after Rooney teed him up with a measured pass</p> <p>United looked by far the more settled of the two sides and they were value for their lead when it came on 18 minutes. A quick exchange involving Evra Berbatov and Rooney, saw the French full-back cut inside Jose Bosingwa, and cross low for Berbatov. The striker's shot squirmed away from Cech, but Park was on hand to slide in the opening goal.</p> <p>Chelsea created a half-chance when Florent Malouda stole a half-yard on Evans only to be denied by Edwin van der Sar, who took both ball and player, leading to the inevitable penalty appeals from the home crowd. But though no spot-kick was awarded, Van der Sar picked up a knock in the collision, which required him to become the latest player to retire from the fray, after his second spill of the day. </p> <p>The Dutchman's replacement Robert Kuszczak looked barely more assured dropping the first shot that came his way - a hopeful attempt from Alex on 39 minutes. Ploughing a lonely furrow up front, Anelka's sole contribution to the match was a shot he blazed over from 12 yards five minutes before the interval, so after the break he was joined by Didier Drogba in an attempt to sharpen Chelsea's cutting edge.</p> <p>The Blues looked brighter following Drogba's introduction. Frank Lampard and Ballack began to press forward more, looking to expose the fitness of Neville early in the second half with a succession of crosses from the left. Joe Cole missed two more good chances as the Blues began to dominate. The first was an air-kick from 10 yards out after Anelka slid him in, the second a drive from 16 yards which produced a good block by Kuszczak, albeit after the England midfielder shot straight at him.</p> <p>Anelka, though, was guilty of the most glaring miss of all, failing to connect with Joe Cole's low right-wing cross from point-blank range with 18 minutes to go. The Blues were laying siege to United's goal and, although the visitors could have snatched a breakaway second when Rooney shot wide from 15 yards, the hosts deservedly equalised 10 minutes from time. Rooney gave away a needless free-kick 25 yards out, John Obi Mikel drifted the ball in and substitute Kalou arrived unmarked to head past Kuszczak from close range.</p> <p>With the bit between their teeth, Chelsea surged forward in search of a winner and Kalou could have scored again within a minute after a scrambled clearance fell kindly. The striker rushed his shot, though, under pressure from Kuszczak and Ferdinand, and scooped his shot over. The match was becoming increasingly fraught with Mike Riley booking no fewer than seven players, but a committed display, embodied by Alex's brave block to stop Fletcher's goalbound piledriver five minutes from time, finally came to an end with nothing to separate the two sides save for the six points that divide them in the Premier League table.</p> <p>Sir Alex Ferguson was left to rue United's lack of killer instinct. \"We played with great tempo in the first 20 minutes - the real shame was that we didn't go for the jugular at 1-0 up,\" Ferguson said. \"We had control of the match at that point but we eased off and allowed them to get to half-time.\"</p> <p>The United manager also admitted surprise that seven of his players were booked, earning an automatic fine from the Football Association. \"It was a competitive game but I did not think there was one bad tackle in it,\" Ferguson said.</p> <p>Scolari was less incredulous. \"I am not surprised,\" he said. \"That is what the referee is there for. If players do not respect him, it should be yellow and red cards. It doesn't matter who you are - Liverpool or Manchester United, whoever.\"</p> <p>The Chelsea coach praised his players' commitment in battling back from a goal down. \"They [the players] have a fantastic spirit. I said before the game Michael Ballack had maybe 45 minutes in him and Didier Drogba 45 minutes. Michael played 70 minutes because of his spirit and he wants to win - he gave more than I expected.</p> <p>\"I have many problems in terms of injuries and I have to change the team but that is my job.\"</p>",

The National Rifle Association is sending out a flier to voters on their mailing list attacking Barack Obama's record on gun control. </p> <p><a href=\"http://andrewchen.typepad.com/andrew_chens_blog/2008/07/obama-and-mccain-how-political-marketing-has-evolved-from-offline-to-online.html\">Karl Rove is a master of direct mail</a>, efficiently targeting \"<a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200411/green/1\">a particular demographic sliver to win a close race</a>\". Both parties use direct mail. It's cheap and easy to target specific voting groups. Democrats also use direct mail with both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama using mail campaigns during the primaries.</p> <p>Most direct mail campaigns fly under the radar. The media focuses on the air war in part because it's easy. The campaigns send press releases promoting the ads, hoping to get the media to give them free air time. Direct mail is almost like the analogue version of a chain e-mail, and unless you're in the chain (on the mailing list), you don't see it.</p> <p>I mentioned the role of direct mail to a friend here in Washington, and she said that the National Rifle Association has sent her a mailer claiming that Barack Obama would take away Americans' guns if he was elected president. She had gone to a shooting range and got on the NRA mailing list. The <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/kevglobal/2875564024/in/photostream/\">flier said that Obama</a> has supported a \"total ban on handguns\" and a \"ban on the sale or transfer of all semi-auto firearms\", and the NRA's Institute for Legislative Action has a <a href=\"http://nraila.org/obama/\">website set up to expand on the flier.</a> </p> <p>Most of this is pretty tame and predictable by historical standards. In the last election, the <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/09/24/politics/main645393.shtml\">Republican National Committee sent out fliers to voters in West Virginia and Arkansas</a> saying that 'liberals' would ban the Bible and allow same-sex marriage.

  "<p>Transport for London has <a href=\"http://www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/sixth-annual-impacts-monitoring-report-2008-07.pdf\">come clean (pdf)</a> about the failure of the <a href=\"http://www.tfl.gov.uk/roadusers/congestioncharging/\">congestion charge</a> to reduce congestion, but it still deflects blame. The usual suspects are cited: roadworks and volume of traffic. Meanwhile, the underlying cause of our congestion problem goes unreported: intrusive traffic management in the form, above all, of 24-hour traffic lights. </p> <p>Anyone can see that lights are often badly phased, except the experts who phase them. But most lights are bad news per se. Look what happens when they are out of action: courtesy thrives, congestion dissolves. As soon as they are \"working\" again, the jams and hostility are back. If we were free to use our innate ability and commonsense to filter, and subsequently road capacity were exceeded, congestion charging might be justified. Until then, it's another premature layer of control and enforcement to cure problems of the experts' own making. It does nothing to reduce danger and delay at junctions plagued by priority rules and traffic lights. </p> <p>If we removed main road priority, which makes roads dangerous in the first place, we'd remove the \"need\" for lights and the need for speed. Then all road-users could do what is natural and intrinsically safe: approach junctions carefully, watch the road, and go on opportunity. Simultaneous filtering is not only infinitely more civilised than stop-start consecutive queuing. It is infinitely more efficient. </p> <p>The authors of discredited traffic measures usually remain anonymous. For the C-charge flop, we can hold two people responsible: Ken Livingstone and <a href=\"http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/about-tfl/1434.aspx\">Malcolm Murray-Clark</a>. Murray-Clark says the central zone is not under threat, but admits the western extension \"could be dropped\". </p> <p>Manchester, which reluctantly agreed to a referendum, is angling for a <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/6691683.stm\">charge</a> \"to raise money for public transport\". Instead of high-cost coercion, how about making public transport desirable by investing in electric-powered, wifi-equipped, air-conditioned buses with delightful attendants and Radio 4 on tap? </p> <p>The zero-emissions hydrogen <a href=\"http://automobiles.honda.com/fcx-clarity/\">Honda FCX</a> will shortly be available in Japan and the US. Why not here? Because we have no refuelling infrastructure. Take a Lexus with 192 grams per kilometre CO2 and a VW with 99g/km \u2013 which is C-charge exempt? The Lexus, because it's a hybrid, while the VW Bluemotion, Skoda Greenline, Fiat Eco version, Seat Ecomotive, Vauxhall ECOflex or Ford Econetic \"only\" make refined use of existing technology. Depressingly, this doublethink is being perpetuated under the new mayor. </p> <p>You'd think that if you live in the zone, renounced car ownership and hired a car when you needed it, you'd be able to register for the discount as an individual, with a permit that could be moved from car to car. You'd be wrong. As with residents' parking, you may only register a vehicle. Why? Because individual registration would be \"harder to police\". The system encourages car ownership! </p> <p>Not only is the C-charge environmentally, economically and politically inept, it's socially and operationally odious. Like extortionate parking controls, it epitomises intolerance.

  "<p>Labour is a <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7627797.stm\">pro-business party</a>, Gordon Brown insisted in his interview with Andrew Marr on BBC1 this morning. A few moments later he said it again. Labour is pro-business, pro-enterprise and pro-markets, the prime minister insisted. But is that claim true? Listening to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labourconference\">Labour party in Manchester</a> so far, I just don't think it is true.</p> <p>Brown is nothing if not attentive to the political mood. He is famously a sleepless scrutiniser of the media and the newspapers. I think these comments of his this morning were a tribute to that vigilance \u2013 because part of his brain is aware that Labour is already riding a populist political tiger this week. Brown's celebration of his interventionist actions in the financial crisis is designed to protect him from his challengers. But it has unleashed a torrent of old-time anti-capitalist rhetoric from the party in Manchester. There was a lot of it in the hall on Saturday, semi-sanctioned by the Labour leadership including Brown himself, and there was a deal more of it in last night's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2008/sep/21/labourconference.labour\">Compass rally</a> and at the union events on the fringes. And I think Brown is already worried \u2013 rightly \u2013 about what he has triggered.</p> <p>Brown has to accept some responsibility for encouraging this reversionary leftist mood in Manchester. In his three small speeches in the hall yesterday, Brown never talked about being pro-business, pro-enterprise or even pro-markets, not in an unequivocal way. In the hall yesterday, his key message was that he would do \"whatever it takes\" to save peoples' jobs, savings and pensions in the face of the financial collapse. These interests were more important than those of a few hedge funds, he said. Recent high dividends and executive pay were not based on longterm values. The conference loved it. Treasury chief secretary Yvette Cooper made the ambitious statement that executive pay had to be restrained this year. Good luck to her, but I wonder how she intends to achieve that?</p> <p>The closest that Brown came yesterday to saying what he told Marr this morning was when he said that markets were in the public interest but they shouldn't be equated with the public interest \u2013 actually a good formulation, in my view. By this morning, however, I think Brown has realised that he has let something out of the cage that he may not be able to control. Hence, in front of a wider television audience, his repeated restatement of Labour's pro-business credentials.</p> <p>But it may not calm the mood as far as the conference is concerned. Brown's determination to use his interventions in the financial crisis last week as proof of his strength and seriousness in the face of potential leadership challenges this week has let his ministers and his supporters off the leash, and given a green light to the unions and the Labour left to demand a more regulatory approach too. The era of free markets can be over, announced <a href=\"http://www.compassonline.org.uk/\">Compass</a>'s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/neallawson\">Neal Lawson</a> at his organisation's rally; effective management of capitalism was on the agenda and the crisis has given Labour a lifeline. The wheel of history has turned, said Jon Trickett MP.</p> <p>I agree strongly that businesses and bankers must act in the people's interests. But Labour seems to me to be adopting this line in the wrong way, at the wrong time and in political conditions that risk doing far more damage than good to the party's prospects. Maybe I'm wrong. I hope I am. Maybe there is a public out there that is yearning for Labour to finally start laying into the City and to markets \u2013 but I'd like some real proof of that rather than some ministerial intuition. Common sense suggests somehting different, that a public that is already fed up with Labour and fed up with Brown \u2013 the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/21/labour.polls\">Observer poll</a> this morning suggests a Tory majority of 146 at the next election \u2013 may blame Brown for the current turmoil rather than turn to him to get us out of it.</p> <p>And even if this doesn't happen, Labour is still playing with fire. The party lost four successive general elections while it remained committed to high taxes and tough state controls over the economy. It began to win general elections when it rethought its positions. My own view is that Labour then failed to offer a new social democratic programme \u2013 not an old Labour one \u2013 when it had the political strength to do so. I think a huge opportunity was missed around the 2001 election. Seven years on, it is taking a very large risk if it now reverts to old Labour instincts, as Lawson says it should, in current circumstances.</p> <p>Maybe that risk is worth taking \u2013 it's not impossible and certainly not unarguable. But don't pretend it's not a risk, and don't pretend that a government that has done nothing to prepare the public for this about-face and a party that is languishing in the 20s in the polls are in strong positions to carry this off. Labour is being very reckless and Brown seems belatedly to sense this, if his comments to Marr are a guide. But he set this opportunist and almost frivolous anti-capitalist mood running \u2013 and it may do him long-term harm for the sake of some dubious short-term good.<br></p>",
  "<p><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/politics/gordonbrown\">Gordon Brown</a> today delivered his most outspoken attack on misconduct in the City as he insisted that he was best placed to lead Britain through the current economic difficulties.</p> <p>In an interview with the BBC's Andrew Marr, he said that there had been \"a great deal of irresponsibility\" in the City and he said aspects of the current bonus system were unacceptable.</p> <p>The prime minister, who in the past has been reluctant to criticise the level of City bonuses, also acknowledged that he needed to \"do better\".</p> <p>In the wide-ranging interview, the prime minister admitted that he had made mistakes, particularly over the abolition of the 10p starting rate of tax, but he refused to contemplate standing down to make way for an alternative leader.</p> <p>He said the government was committed to <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/sep/21/children.childcare\">expanding free nursery provision</a> to provide free places for all two-year-olds. </p> <p>But, when asked about the impact of the current economic turmoil on government finances, he did not rule out taxes having to rise at some point as a result.</p> <p>Brown was interviewed following the publication of a <a href=\" http://www.politicshome.com/usa/landing.aspx\">PoliticsHome</a> survey saying that, if there was an election now, the Tories would win a majority of 146.</p> <p>On bonuses, Brown said: \"I think there's an element of the bonus system that is unacceptable \u2026 When you have got a bonus on your salary based on short-term deals that has no relationship to long-term profits, you have got to look again at what that system is doing.\"</p> <p>He said the Financial Services Authority was looking into this. But he acknowledged that it could be difficult to deal with this through legislation.</p> <p>Brown reaffirmed his believe that he was the best person to lead Britain through its current difficulties. \"I'm better prepared to deal with that then perhaps anyone because you can't deal with it with slogans or PR or good soundbites,\" he said.</p> <p> \"You have got to deal with it by the wisdom of the decisions you make.\"</p> <p>Brown insisted that the cabinet was \"pretty united\" and when Marr asked him if he would contemplate resigning to make way for another leader, Brown insisted that he was focusing his job.</p> <p>Asked about Labour's plights, Brown quoted the approach taken by one of Joseph Conrad's characters. \"When you are facing a storm, what do you do? The best way to deal with a storm is to face it.\"</p> <p>He said that governments around the world were facing difficulties because of the economy. But he insisted that, when it came to the election, voters would have to make a choice between one party and another.</p> <p>Asked if he would still be leader at Christmas, he replied: \"Yes, of course.\" </p> <p>He downplayed the prospect of losing the <a href=\"\" http: www.theguardian.com politics glenrothes\">Glenrothes byelection</a>, saying that \"byelections are byelections\".</p> <p>But he accepted the need to improve. Asked if he needed to do better, he said: \"I always want to do better. I will do better.\"</p> <p>He went on: \"I think there are always lessons that have got to be learnt. I don't think people would see me as anything other than someone who wants to learn the lessons.</p> <p>\"I am never complacent, always vigilant, always wanting to test what we are doing against what we have done previously and to learn lessons from that. That's the business of government.\"</p> <p>When Marr put it to him that he did not accept responsibility for his mistakes, Brown replied: \"I don't accept that. I have said very clearly that when we had the 10p tax problem, that was my responsibility.\"</p> <p>Commenting on the economy, Brown twice stressed that his was a \"pro-business government\". He went on: \"We are pro-markets. But it will help business if we can clean up what has gone wrong.\"</p> <p>He argued that part of the current problems were caused by the fact that while financial markets are global, regulation is still national. </p> <p>He said he had been pushing for the creation of a global regulatory framework for some time and that he would be pressing ahead with this when he went to New York later this week.</p> <p>But he repeatedly argued that his experience as chancellor equipped him to deal with the problems facing Britain. \"It's a testing time and it's a time for being tested on your judgment and the values that you have.\"</p> <p>When Marr put it to him that his claims to have brought an end to the era of \"boom and bust\" were exposed as false, Brown said that interest rates were only 5% now, compared to 15% or more at the time of the last downturn.</p> <p>Brown insisted that the decision to lend \u00a3100bn to put more liquidity into the banking system would not cost the taxpayers money. \"That's effectively a loan. It's money that will be paid back.\"</p> <p>But when Marr put it to him that taxes would have to rise, Brown replied: \"These are decisions for the budget. I do say to you that every country is facing exactly the same problems.\"</p> <p>George Osborne, the shadow chancellor, said: \"Gordon Brown's interview shows he is increasingly becoming a stranger from the political and economic truth. </p> <p>\"The prime minister is increasingly living in a fantasy land, where his leadership is only under challenge because of the economic problems, where Britain is well prepared for a downturn, and where he bears no responsibility for the debt boom that he allowed to develop in his 10 years as chancellor.\"</p>",
  "<p>A crackdown on the \"scandalous\" behaviour of \"no win, no fee\" lawyers, who have ramped up their fees in recent years, is to be launched by the government.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/jackstraw\">Jack Straw</a>, the justice secretary, told the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labourconference\">Labour conference</a> in Manchester this morning that he is considering whether to impose a cap on their fees.</p> <p>\"I am concerned about 'no win no fee' arrangements,\" Straw said. \"It's claimed they have provided greater access to justice but the behaviour of some lawyers in ramping up their fees in these cases is nothing short of scandalous.</p> <p>\"So I am going to address this and consider whether to cap more tightly the level of success fees that lawyers can charge.\"</p> <p>Straw, who told the conference that Labour has been the first government since the war to cut crime, made clear he had his eyes on legal aid lawyers too.</p> <p>Dismissing calls to increase the legal aid budget, the justice secretary said that more was spent per head in England and Wales on legal aid than anywhere else in the world.</p> <p>With spending now matching the amount spent on prisons, Straw said: \"There are now three times as many lawyers in private practice but paid for by the taxpayer as there were three decades ago; the budget has grown faster than the health and education services. </p> <p>\"The challenge now is how better to spend these huge sums in the interests of justice; something I want to do with the legal profession and local government.\"</p> <p>Straw's crackdown on lawyers is part of a campaign to open up the justice system as he strives to lift the \"veil\" by:</p> <p>\u2022 Introducing online court records \"so anyone can see for themselves what happened when someone appears in the dock\"</p> <p>\u2022 Making community sentences more visible to the public so that people can see them working. \"We are introducing high visibility jackets for all those on such sentences,\" he said</p> <p>\u2022 Shedding more light on family courts while \"preserving the imperative of the welfare of the child\".</p> <p>\"Labour will always put victims and their families first,\" Straw said. \"That's why we are transforming criminal justice from a bureaucratic system to the public's service. It's about a change of culture, of attitude, about lifting the veil which sometimes keeps justice from view: explaining more, hiding less.\"</p> <p>Straw, who was Tony Blair's first home secretary between 1997 and 2001, used his speech to reject Tory charges that crime has spiralled out of control under Labour. </p> <p>\"We never promised in 1997 to be the first government since the war to cut crime and to do so by a third, to increase police numbers by 14,000, to cut household burglary by 50% and car crime by almost 60%. But we've done them all - and more.\"</p> <p>Labour's success had not been a \"lucky fluke\", Straw added as he reprised Blair's most famous line. \"We've delivered because our values are the ones most likely to create safer communities. Fair rules, firm punishments. Rights but also responsibilities. Deterrent and reform. Tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime.\"</p> <p>Straw was scathing about the Tories, who are now portraying themselves as the champions of fairness. \"I can understand why the Tories want to try to appropriate our language, to sugar coat their wafer-thin agenda with the fallacy they care about social justice. But we must not let them get away with it.</p> <p>\"When these same people had the chance to act, to show their commitment to those things they profess today to care about, they allowed crime to double. They could have acted on racial hatred, set up the enquiry into the death of Stephen Lawrence. They didn't. We did.</p> <p>\"Now, contrary to all evidence, the Tories accuse us of creating a 'broken Britain'. It shows how little they have changed. Running the country down when they were in power. And now trying to run it down to gain power.\"</p>",
  "<p>Today is <a href=\"http://www.alz.co.uk/adi/wad/\">World Alzheimer's day</a> - not that my dad, diagnosed almost four years ago, or a large swathe of the 700,000 others suffering from the same disease in the UK, will know. He is in a psychiatric hospital, robbed of speech and memory. Aged 87, he is cared for by overworked staff who are kind. They dress, bathe, feed and take him to the toilet and they try their best to squeeze in an extra few minutes each day to give him their time. But mostly my dad just sits.</p> <p>On October 1st, in the UK, we are all supposed to celebrate Older Peoples' day. Its patronising theme this year is, <a href=\"www.dwp.gov.uk/fulloflife\">\"Full of Life\"</a>. Full of life, that is, if you receive the kind of support that gives you a modicum of independence , control and a sense of well being. </p> <p>Earlier this year, three charities, <a href=\"http://www.counselandcare.org.uk/\">Counsel and Care</a>, <a href=\"http://www.carersuk.org/Home\">Carers UK</a> and <a href=\"http://www.helptheaged.org.uk/en-gb\">Help the Aged</a>, collaborated to launch an impressive campaign, <a href=\"www.rightcare.org.uk)\">Right Care Right Deal </a>. At some stage in life, everybody will be involved in the business of care - either their own or that of a relative or a friend. What they will discover is that what's on offer, in the main, is brutal, shockingly inadequate, unjust and a disgrace.</p> <p>The campaign has accumulated a range of statistics that illustrates how social care and health in the 21st century is unfit for purpose. In Japan, there are seven stages of support beginning at very modest and ending at highly intensive - allowing people to continue the life they have always lived for as long as possible. This system recognises that a person who is 60 or older still has rights as a citizen that ought to be respected.</p> <p>In contrast, too often in the UK a person has to reach a point of helplessness and despair - and even then, help may not materialise. In the early 1980s, the typical local authority helped 6,500 people - now the figure <a href=\"www.rightcare.org.uk\">has fallen to 2,500</a>. Two thirds of local authorities provide care only to people whose needs are either \"critical\" or \"substantial\". The result is a huge burden on carers.</p> <p>The poverty of support is matched by the iniquity of the bureaucracy. Acquiring appropriate care to keep a person in their own home; seeking out a suitable high quality residential place; working out who pays what and why is confusing, contradictory time consuming mess. In addition, while there are stunningly good exceptions, too many care homes are incubators of misery. </p> <p>According to a <a href=\"http://www.jrf.org.uk/knowledge/findings/socialcare/2260.asp\">report</a> published this week by Joseph Rowntree Foundation an extra \u00a3540m of extra funding is required to fund \"a modernised care home sector\". </p> <p>Sir Derek Wanless who investigated the cost of care for the <a href=\"www.kingsfund.org.uk\">King's Fund</a> and the Joseph Rowntree Foundation said it would require an extra \u00a36 billion over the next 20 years just to keep the system at its present rotten state. The government earlier this year launched a debate on the future of care and support services and a green paper will be published next year.<br> The Right Care, Right Deal coalition are endeavouring to spark this, as yet, torpid \"debate\" at the party conferences. Wanless proposed that the state should meet two-thirds of the cost of social care and individuals should pay for the rest with additional help.</p> <p>What's also required is a system that is universal and that treats Alzheimer's as a disease not a \"natural\" part of ageing the cost of which is frequently borne by the patient. Better use of resources and more efforts to keep people active and at home are also essential. Equally important is the establishment of a consensus across the political parties about funding and the institution of a simple, transparent , fair system of entitlement and payment. <br> The population of older people is accelerating fast. Baby boomers (or at least some of them) may be the last generation for a lengthy time who can afford to buy their own solutions. Planning a couple of decades ahead, however, is anathema to politicians. As a result, we have barely begun a conversation about what constitutes quality of care let alone debated who will pay for it and how can it be delivered.  An army of people in the final years of their life exist in loneliness, isolation and neglect or they are warehoused in homes or they are cared for by relatives who, being only human, are also at times exhausted, depressed and angry. </p> <p>It's an odd quirk but many of us believe that old age is something that will never happen to us: not \"old' old. When my dad was capable of thought, that's what he believed too. He was fit, active and constantly curious but that combination proved a poor innoculation. </p> <p>In a few residential homes in the UK, care for those with dementia is hugely imaginative. Even those as advanced as my father are stimulated, talked too, entertained and involved - and given a degree of autonomy about how they spend their time. Until that's the norm rather than the exception, until we actively try to resolve this crisis of care that is already upon us, what many of us will experience is an old age that is so empty of life, it resembles a living death.</p>",
  "<p>The official death toll from the suicide bomb blast that ripped through a luxury hotel in Islamabad yesterday has risen to 53, the Pakistani prime minister, Yousuf Gilani, said today. </p> <p>The blast, one of the biggest attacks in Pakistan for over a decade, happened at the Marriott hotel at around 8pm. The hotel was left burning fiercely all along its fa\u00e7ade, while other buildings in the vicinity were also left damaged.</p> <p>Witnesses said security staff at the front of the hotel, where the blast was strongest, had 'simply been vaporised'.</p> <p>Scores of bodies were being brought out of the flaming building as rescue workers battled the blaze in scenes of chaos.</p> <p>Victims included the Czech ambassador, it emerged today. Two Americans and a Vietnamese national were also killed. Eleven other foreigners were among the 266 wounded in the blast, Rehman Malik, the top official in the interior ministry, told Reuters.</p> <p>At least four Britons were injured in the attack, two of them children. Officials told Reuters that a British woman remained in hospital.</p> <p>Rescue teams were today searching the blackened hotel but temperatures remained high and fires were still being put out in some parts. Officials said the main building could still collapse.</p> <p>In a televised address to Pakistan today, the president, Asif Ali Zardari, said: \"This is an epidemic, a cancer in Pakistan which we will root out. We will not be afraid of these cowards.\"</p> <p>The foreign secretary, David Miliband, condemned the strike as \"yet another shocking and disgraceful attack without justification\". He said such a \"brutal act of terror deserves the condemnation of the entire international community\" and added that the British government would continue \"to stand shoulder to shoulder with the government of Pakistan against the violent extremists who have no answers, but only offer death and mayhem\".</p> <p>The US president, George Bush, said the attack was \"a reminder of the ongoing threat faced by Pakistan, the United States, and all those who stand against violent extremism\".</p> <p>Hotel staff said that all the Marriott's function rooms, including the large ballroom, had been hired for iftar - the traditional communal meal that breaks the day-long fast that Muslims observe during the holy month of Ramadan. According to the hotel owner, at least 700 people would have been in the hotel at the time of the blast at 8pm. Around 300 eating under a marquee at the back of the hotel away from the blast survived.</p> <p>The senior police official Asghar Raza Gardezi said the explosion was caused by more than a tonne of explosives, probably delivered in a small truck. Other reports indicated a series of bombs - possibly one small explosion that paved the way for other, larger, blasts.</p> <p>Imtiaz Gul, a journalist, was dining with friends in the marquee when the attack happened. \"First there was a blast and then all the electricity went out ... then it came back on and there was a second much bigger blast or a series of deafening blasts,\" he said.</p> <p>\"We found our way out but it was really harrowing. It was carnage, there was debris everywhere, body parts, glass. At the front of the hotel there were not even body parts. The blast had just destroyed everything.\"</p> <p>Other witnesses spoke of corpses strewn on the ground. Scores of ambulances rushed to the scene, negotiating burnt-out vehicles and a vast crater left by the explosion. Windows in buildings nearly a mile away in residential areas and a heavily guarded compound where ministers have their official homes were damaged.</p> <p>The Marriott is in the centre of the city, close to the National Assembly, the main commercial thoroughfare and the national television headquarters. Security has been high at the hotel since a previous attempted suicide bombing in 2007, foiled by a security guard.</p> <p>A US state department official using a section of white pipe as a walking stick was seen leading three colleagues through the rubble from the charred building, one of them bleeding heavily from a wound on the side of his head.</p> <p>One of the four, who identified himself only as Tony, said they had begun moving towards the rear of the hotel's Chinese restaurant after the first blast when the second threw them against the back wall. \"Then we saw a big truck coming through the gates,\" he said. \"After that it was just smoke and darkness.\"</p> <p>There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast, though radical militants allied with the Taliban and al-Qaida who are engaged in a violent insurgency in Pakistan will be the prime suspects.</p> <p>The use of multiple truck bombs is a favoured technique of Islamic militants. A security guard at the scene said he saw a large vehicle that caught fire on its front before suddenly exploding.</p> <p>Pakistan, a key US ally in the war on terror, has faced a wave of militant violence in recent weeks following offensives by its army against insurgents in the restive regions along its frontier with Afghanistan. Though the capital has avoided most of the bloodshed, hundreds have died in a series of bombings and suicide attacks in the last six months.

  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p>&#xa0;</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Morning all.</strong> A healing breeze has blown through the Midlands this week, with all the pre-match injury doubts taking their place in the starting line-up. That means for the home side Gianni Zuiverloon takes his place at the back, alongside Abdoulaye Meite, both of whom have recovered from knack. For Villa, Curtis Davies, Ashley Young and John Carew are all also fresh as daisies and start.</p> <p>No real surprises, then, in either line-up:</p> <p><strong>West Brom: </strong>Carson, Zuiverloon, Meite, Olsson, Robinson,<br>Borja Valero, Morrison, Koren, Greening, Brunt, Bednar. <strong>Subs:</strong><br>Kiely, Hoefkens, Cech, Barnett, Miller, Kim, Moore.</p> <p><strong>Aston Villa:</strong> Friedel, Luke Young, Davies, Laursen, Shorey, Reo-Coker, Petrov, Barry, Ashley Young, Carew, Agbonlahor. <strong>Subs:</strong> Guzan, Milner, Harewood, Knight, Salifou, Cuellar, Gardner.</p> <p><strong>Referee:</strong> Mike Dean (Wirral)</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>Preamble: </strong>It's the Black Country/Birmingham/Midlands derby with your Sunday lunch today, with Aston's finest riding high in the Premier League, but facing an always tricky trip to the Handsworth vicinity for a doubtless full-blooded affair against the Baggies. West Brom have just four points from their opening four matches; Villa have seven, which is good for fifth place. They can go second, but West Brom can actually vault 10 places to sixth if they win, leaving clear air between them and perennial mid-table strugglers such as Manchester United. We'll see. Before that: \"What?\" bellows Chris B. \"Tom Lutz too hungover, maybe? Can we now call you Second Choice Swains?\" If only. Fifteenth-choice, more like. (Lutz, incidentally, was injured in the pre-match warm up.)</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>Pre-match warm-up news, and frightening Sky Sports shenanigans:</strong> Abdoulaye Meite was injured in the pre-match warm-up (or maybe hadn't actually recovered from his previous knack) and is replaced by Leon Barnett. As part of their introductory package, Sky Sports just interviewed Frank Lampard in a bar, into which the special effects team had planted countless other Frank Lampards, like a very disturbing \"Being John Malkovich\".</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>1 mins: </strong> And we're off, with the Hawthorns bathed in late summer sun and my television struggling to cope with it. It's 11 shadows versus 11 shadows at the moment.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>2 mins: </strong>Villa have the early possession, pushing down the left with Petrov and Agbonlahor. No difficulties for West Brom, who shepherd it behind. Early boos for former Baggie Curtis Davies, but otherwise a raucous atmosphere at the Hawthorns.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>3 mins: </strong>A scrappy passage of play in midfield results in the ball coming to Bednar, who lays off for Jonathan Greening to have a speculative low shot from 25 yards. Friedel falls on it to his right.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>5 mins: </strong>There's more space in these early stages than we might have expected, and Koren is able to whip in a dangerous cross across the six yard box. Villa were pushing up and the ball skews out for a throw. Promising start for West Brom.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>7 mins: </strong>Carew and Agbonlahor are dropping deep, with the Norwegian, in particular, getting involved in the midfield. He tries to surge forward but is blocked. Tony Mobray sucks happily away on his lemon on the bench.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>8 mins:</strong> First corner of the match goes to West Brom when Bednar's attempted cross from the right grazes Martin Laursen's leg and goes behind. It's deep, inswung, to the far post, but Curtis Davies clears to token derision from the home crowd, still seemingly seething about the \u00a38m-odd they prised from Villa for the centre-back.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>11 mins: </strong>The frenetic start has slowed somewhat now, with Villa's attempt to launch anything meaningful down the left quickly snuffed out. Better from West Brom, for whom James Morrison out-muscles Petrov in midfield, dances down the right wing and fizzes a decent cross through the penalty area. No one on the end of it, and it goes behind.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>13 mins:</strong> The West Brom back-line stand firm against the probing of Carew. In the midfield, Gareth Barry and Nigel Reo-Coker are switching sides and flicking the ball forward, but Barnett and Olsson stand firm.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>14 mins: </strong>First real chance of the match, as Ashley Young bends a free-kick from the left on to the sizeable forehead of John Carew. The Norwegian rises highest but directs his header past Carson's left stick.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>16 mins:</strong> Villa's strength this season seems to be the adaptability of just about all their players, with Gareth Barry, for instance, doubling up as left back, then right-sided midfielder in a short spell, and Gabriel Agbonlahor, nominally a centre forward, then popping up on the left wing to collect a clipped ball forward from Nicky Shorey. It all comes to nowt, except even more respect for tactical and motivational genius Martin O'Neill.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>19 mins:</strong> Suddenly this is an end-to-end encounter. A scrappy hack-and-miss fest in the Baggies' box ends with a tame header from Agbonlahor. Then West Brom break swiftly through the ice-cream Iglessias Borja Valero. His cross reaches no one, and Villa get down the other end, but Carew's cross is too far ahead of Agbonlahor. Breathless.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>21 mins:</strong> Chris Brunt has picked up an injury and hobbles off, to be replaced by Do-Heon Kim, who fills in naturally on the left side of the attack.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>24 mins:</strong> West Brom attack in number, but by the time they finally get a cross in, from Paul Robinson, Villa have swarmed their own box and clear. Villa are forced to play on the break, but are over-hitting balls to Carew and Agbonlahor, allowing Carson to gather and launch another home-side attack.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>27 mins: Goal! West Brom 0-1 Aston Villa</strong> <br>As simple as that. Leon Barnett concedes a needless free-kick about 40 yards out and Ashley Young lifts it teasingly into the box, John Carew rises unmarked to flick it past Carson. 1-0.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>28 mins: Goal! West Brom 0-2 Aston Villa</strong><br>Nightmare for Leon Barnett, who compounds his previous double-error - giving away the free-kick, then losing Carew - by gifting a second to Villa. A long ball over the top from Ashley Young should be cleared by the Baggies' centre back. But he dithers and dawdles and tries to control it when a hoof it all is necessary and it skews to Gabriel Agbonlahor on the right. He charges onto it at the angle of the box, right, and drills a low shot across Carson and into the far bottom corner. Excellent finish. There were 32 seconds between those two goals.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>32 mins:</strong> West Brom had definitely started the brighter here, but those two goals - essentially both on the break - have pretty much ended this as a contest already. Villa might let in the odd late goal, as against Spurs, but... hold on, I'm the idiot, West Brom have just scored.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>34 mins: Goal! West Brom 1-2 Aston Villa</strong><br>Fine play from West Brom, with Bednar exchanging passes with Koren, ends with the latter having a shy from just outside the box. It's a routine save for Brad Friedel, but he only parries it straight into the path of James Morrison. The winger wants it more than Nickey Shorey, who is also chasing the rebound, and Morrison stabs it past the grounded Friedel. Game back on.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>38 mins: </strong>The goalscorer Morrison goes into the book for delaying a free-kick, from exactly the spot that spawned Villa's first goal. This time it's over-hit from Young and goes harmlessly behind. Paul Robinson then follows him into the book for scything down Stilian Petrov, who is on a mazy dribble in his own half. Luke Young's free kick raises havoc in the box when no one clears and Agbonlahor prepares the shot. But he doesn't get it off in time and West Brom clear. Suddenly it's all happening again.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>40 mins:</strong> Ping-pong in the Villa box now after Koren releases Robinson down the left and his chipped cross nearly picks out Morrison. Martin Laursen clears.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>43 mins:</strong> Jonathan Greening wriggles to the byeline and hoists a cross onto the penalty spot. None of his teammates have matched the effort and it's easily cleared. On another attack, Paul Robinson launches one forward to Bednar, but Laursen is there again.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>44 mins: </strong>Terrific save from Brad Friedel denies West Brom what would be, frankly, a deserved equaliser. Paul Robinson is given hours of time to whip a cross in from the left, deep, and his arrow picks out the head of Kim, whose header is strong and well directed. Friedel dives to his left and pushes it away, one-handed. Rejoice! An email: \"I like John Carew as a player, but he is a sign of what's wrong with English football,\" says Gary Naylor. \"He's nowhere near good enough to play in a side with ambitions for the title, but much too good to play in a side threatened with relegation. It's not their fault, but the John Carews of the Premier League (and there's a fair few of them) make for a predictable season.\"</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>45 mins: </strong>Corner for Villa is too near to Scott Carson, who punches clear. And that's the last meaningful action of a compelling first-half, with Villa leading 2-1 but West Brom cheered off the pitch after an energetic, and not unskillful, showing. Back in 15.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>Half-time email:</strong> \"Wotcha,\" greets Nick Glynn, as though in the playground. \"West Brom are another of our (Villa's) \"local rivals\" whose fans have a passionate dislike for us, which is, as far as I'm aware, not in any way reciprocated amongst Villa fans. Coventry have the same problem. Why can't we all just get along?\" Aaah, a plea for solidarity and peace in the Midlands. \"Except with Birmingham City, obviously. Screw them all the way to hell.\" Oh.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>46 mins: </strong>This is just a fact - no glossing: Gabriel Agbonlahor has just thrown up on the pitch.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>46 mins: </strong>As Agbonlahor continues to re-examine his half-time orange splattered on the pitch, no one picks up the West Brom defender Gianni Zuiverloon who decides to have a shot from just outside the box. It's dipping viciously, but too late and it flies over Friedel's bar.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>48 mins:</strong> Terrific start for the Baggies who are closing down swiftly in midfield and feeding their wide players. With Bednar waiting in the middle, Robinson swings one in from the left, forcing Laursen to head clear. Then Curtis Davies gets to one before the onrushing Kim and earns the boos of the home fans when he hacks it away.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>50 mins: </strong>Ashley Young is called into defensive action to clear yet another cross from Robinson, but Villa go right up the other end and almost bag a third. Nigel Reo-Coker stabs a ball outside the full back and perfectly onto the run on John Carew. The Norwegian aims his low shot across Scott Carson, but it grazes the outside of the post and out.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>52 mins:</strong> A neat combination between Petrov and Ashley young on the left - Young delicately backheeling into Petrov's dashing run - is crudely ended by Valero, who chops down the Bulgarian and sees yellow.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>54 mins: </strong>John Carew hits the post again! Stilian Petrov, who is playing very well here against the odds, exchanges passes with Luke Young on the right and picks out Carew in the middle. A deft nudge into the centre-back's back earns the extra space for the Norwegian and he angles his downward header wide of Carson, but still can't beat the post.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>57 mins:</strong> Here comes the full force of Tony Mobray's chalk-board as two strikers strip off on the bench ready to join the action. Luke Moore and Ishmael Miller replace Bednar and Valero.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>59 mins: </strong>West Brom will now revert to a more formal 4-4-2 with the new arrivals taking their place up front in place of the largely ineffective Valero and Bednar. Moore, if I remember from his Villa days, has bags of pace and could trouble his former teammates if they can give him something to run onto. West Brom have a corner, and some sustained pressure, which ends with Greening whipping in a cross from the left. Moore stabs goalward, but Barry gets a leg in just in the nick of time.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>62 mins:</strong> Ismael Miller gets into the action, but has dropped inexplicably deep and shows a real striker's touch in midfield, stumbling over the ball and then committing a needless foul. Villa hoist the free kick into the box, West Brom clear behind, and Villa's corner also comes to little.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>64 mins:</strong> Again Miller loses the ball, this time as he gets too tricky on the left side of the Villa box. The visitors flood forward and Barry tees up Ashley Young on the edge of the box. He beats his first man, but the shot is charged down.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>66 mins:</strong> Villa seem happy to leave Robinson alone on the left, dropping off the overlapping full-back, which seems like a dangerous policy. This time his cross comes to nothing, but he won't need many more invitations. At the other end, the free-scoring Nigel Reo-Coker (two goals in a year, in the last two games) has a shot from 25 yards, which Carson palms behind for another corner.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>68 mins: </strong>Much better from Miller, who powers past Luke Young, who picks up a yellow card for hauling him down. West Brom waste the free-kick, though, when they send it deep towards the on-rushing Leon Barnett, but he fails to get it into the danger area under the attentions of Nicky Shorey.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>70 mins:</strong> West Brom are again pressing, but Villa are smartly leaving Carew, Agbonlahor and Ashley Young well up the pitch to set up the potential of some formidable counter-attacking. Carew controls in the centre circle, feeds Young on the left, and his scamper forward is checked by Zuiverloon. Reo-Coker then has another shot at goal, this time from the edge of the box and scuffed harmlessly wide.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>72 mins:</strong> Miller is proving to be a robust force up front, but Villa crowd him out. Tony Mowbray calls Luke Moore over for instruction, which will presumably include the directive to touch the ball every once in a while. Villa, meanwhile, line up three subs of their own.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>75 mins: </strong>Villa sub: James Milner replaces Nicky Shorey. The domino effect: Luke Young goes to left back, Nigel Reo-Coker to right back. John Carew booked, although not as a direct result of that.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>76 mins:</strong> Jonathan Greening turns the new Villa right back Reo-Coker inside out and crosses towards Miller. Friedel snaffles it, just as the centre forward winds up the eyebrows. Reo-Coker recovers to go on a surging run at the other end, but can't quite get his own cross in after he gets all the way to the dead-ball line.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>79 mins:</strong> There's the danger for West Brom as they're crowded out on the edge of the Villa box and it breaks to John Carew. He powers across the half-way line, then yields to James Milner to scamper to the edge of the box. Milner is fouled and Villa have a free-kick just outside the box, but Ashley Young can't beat the wall.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>82 mins: </strong>Second sub for Villa - Craig Gardner replaces Stilian Petrov. Like for like, like.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>83 mins: </strong>James Morrison has a shot from 25 yards, which rises all the way over the bar. Andy Murray wins in the Davies Cup for Great Britain. Koren and Greening try to manufacture something down the left wing, which Barry clears. Ronaldo and Didier Drogba are on the bench. Pick the bones out of that.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>86 mins:</strong> Last hurrah from West Brom, or a workmanlike stiffling from Villa? We'll know in about five minutes. Villa are defending deep, and deny Moore then Koren as they break into the box.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>88 mins: </strong>Yellow card for Ashley Young, who is late into a challenge with Leon Barnett, round about the half-way line. There's a scramble in the Villa box after the ball is lifted in, twice, but Barnett fouls his marker and Villa can eat up another few seconds.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>90 mins:</strong> And another couple of seconds disappear for West Brom as John Carew is replaced by Carlos Cuellar.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>90+1 mins:</strong>Four added minutes to play, the first of which sees a corner for West Brom, wasted. Friedel then takes his time over the goal kick and Villa are running the clock down efficiently.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>90+3 mins:</strong> This one's all over. \"There's only one Curtis Davies\" chant the Villa fans, in defense of their centre-back who's been the target of the West Brom boo-boys. The Midlands' Sol Campbell, if you will. Anyway, nothing else to report as the clock ticks down.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>Full-time: </strong>Peep, peep! A jaunty little jump from Martin O'Neill and that's a third away win in the space of five days for Villa. Switch over to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/sep/21/premierleague.chelsea\">Paul Doyle's coverage of Chelsea v Manchester United</a>. Thanks for your interest. Bye.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p>&#xa0;</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Preamble: </strong><br>If Manchester United lose today, they'll fall nine point behind Chelsea \u2013 so just look at the team Alex Ferguson has put out! Short of swapping John O'Shea for Dimitar Berbatov, that really is as conservative as United get. You can forget the dynamic movement and off-the-cuff brilliance Carlos Quieroz cultivated last season, with Ronaldo, Nani, Tevez and Giggs all on the bench, Ferguson seems to have plumped for a rigid 4-4-1-1 designed to offer central solidity. </p> <p>A United victory would not only repair the damage of last week's capitulation at Anfield but, by ending Chelsea's invincibility at Stamford Bridge, would inflict a serious psychological wound on the team most likely to take their Premier League crown \u2013 but the selection shows such thoughts are not foremost in Ferguson's mind. Avoiding defeat is what it's all about today, it seems \u2013 and that caution is, paradoxically, a risk: after all, with Drogba, Ballack and Essien all unable to start, Chelsea are as weak now as they're ever likely to be this season so why not go for the three points today rather than trying to scrap for a draw and chip away at Chelsea's lead over the course of the rest of the season? </p> <p>What's more, with Nemanja Vidic out and Gary Neville still rusty after his long lay-off (judging by his performance on Wednesday at least), United could do with playing on the front foot. </p> <p>You see where this is going, don't you?That's right, towards a prediction: Chelsea to punish Ferguson's timidity by crushing United 3-0. </p> <p><strong>Teams:</strong><br>Chelsea: Cech, Bosingwa, Terry, Carvahlo, A Cole, Mikel, Lampard, J Coe, Ballack, Malouda, Anelka. <br><strong>Subs:</strong> Cudicini, Drogba, Bridge, Kalou, Alex, Belletti.</p> <p><strong>Manchester United:</strong> Van der Sar, Neville, Ferdinand, Evans, Evra, Fetcher, Scholes, Hargreaves, Park, Berbatov, Rooney.<br><strong>Subs: </strong>Kuszczak, Brown, Ronaldo, Giggs, Nani, O'Shea, Tevez</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>1: 49pm: A dissident bleats</strong> \"Chelsea starts with one striker (Anelka), Man U with two (Berbatov, Rooney) so who is the more conservative?\" blathers Davor Jukic. Haven't I already made that clear, Davor? Are you expecting Deco, Joe Cole and Florent Malouda to act as mere drones?</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>1:52pm:</strong> Golly, an early break for United! Deco's only gone and got himself injured in the warm-up! So Ballack will start in his stead. My prediction remains 3-0.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>1:55pm: </strong>\"Ooooooh, so you reckon Chelsea will win do you?\" screeches PhD student Kimberley Taylor. \"Well even if they do at least United won't start having a scrike like dear Terry.\" I don't have a PhD, so can somebody tell me what 'scrike' means?</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>That Fergie team selection explained: </strong> \"I think what you're missing here is the Man Utd - Liverpool rivalry,\" lectures Charles Shell. \"Fergie doesn't just want to win more trophies than Rafa he also wants to out-rotate him. Can't think of any other rationale for including Neville and Park.\"</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>1:58pm: </strong> The teams have taken to the pitch and there is a ferocious and uncharacteristic in at the Bridge. Meanwhile on the sideline, Scolari and Ronaldo have just engaged in a warm embrace, then smile affectionately at each other as Fergie scowls in the background. \"I've had the feeling for the past week or so that Chelsea will outplay United and comprehensively beat them 2-0, maybe 2-1 with United nicking a late consolation,\" sniffs Angus Chisolm. \"On the other hand United do tend to play well when their backs are to the wall so it's not that straightforward, and I don't think Chelsea are going to be the unstoppable force that you have been billing them as for the entire season (although they should be with all the money they've spent). To be honest though I see the title race being contested between Chelsea and Arsenal, with Arsenal just edging it in a triumph of sensibility and consolidation in this era of breezy 30 million pound transfers, with the world club cup doing United absolutely no favours.\" I agree. Angus, and indeed said and wrote before the start of the season that Arsenal, not United, will be second.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>1 min:</strong> We have kick-off! United begin adventurously, with Evra leading a forward charge. After Bosingwa botched a clearance, the Frenchman crossed into the centre. Terry headed out and it fell to Fletcher, whose shot was blocked by Carvahlo.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>3 min:</strong> Lots of hurly-burly so far. Joe Cole introduces the first moment of class, dancing past Park and Evra before crossing into no-man's land.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>5 min: </strong> Belying my ever astute pre-match analysis, United's enterprise continues. Hargreaves bombed down the right just now and fizzed a cross in that Fletcher met on the volley. It flew just wide. Meanwhile, thanks for all you who wrote in to inform me that 'scrike' means 'cry'. In which language I do not know</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>6 min:</strong> United have begun with a high tempo but Rooney so far seems off the pace and has just been dispossessed easily by Bosingwa after dawdling on the ball.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong> 8 min:</strong> Continuing the trend of belying my utterings, Rooney reacts rapidly to a fluffed Cech clearance and darn near scores with a lob from 35 yards. \"Can you point to that silly United fan that if you take account of fund recouped, United spent more than Chelsea this summer?\" demands Mathias Larsen, doing the pointing out instead. \"Chelsea will indeed win 3-0,\" he concludes.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>9 min:</strong> What a miss! Evra made an acrobatic arse of himself when bicycle-kicking fresh to allow Joe Cole to scamper through on goal. With only Van der Sar to beat he slashes the ball wide!</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>12 min:</strong> It's an engrossing game so far, as fast and intense as you'd expect. After United's bright start, the more powerful home side are starting to gain the upperhand \u2026</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>13 min:</strong> Bloody hell! Carvahlo appears to have picked up an injury and has to be replaced by Alex. So now Chelsea and, more importantly, my Fantasy Football team, have lost both Carvahlo and Deco!</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>15 min:</strong> Ashley Cole sprints down the flank and is picked out by Malouda, but the backtracking Hargreaves prevents him from getting a cross in. Meanwhile, word from the sidelines is that Carvahlo may have done his ligaments so could be out for many weeks. \"Paul Scholes, the man with the worst technique in the Premier League (but tackling, so nobody seems to care about it), is nailed on for a yellow card and a substitution here,\" forsees Gary Naylor. \"No good Andy Gray whinging, Scholes stops the game more than any other player and should, if anything, get even more cards than the 100+ that he has.\"</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>17 min:</strong> As he did for England in Croatia, Ferdinand steps forward superbly to instigate an attack. He exchanges passes with Rooney at the edge of the area and then brings a fine save from Cech. Admittedly, this is not the conservative United approach that, ahem, some people foresaw.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Chelsea 0-1 United (Park 18')</strong></p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>18 min: </strong>An excellent goal and, it must be said, just reward for United's enterprising start. Evra was the catalyst, bursting down the left to trigger panic in the Chelsea defence. He continued his run and the Rooney slipped a lovely ball through to him before he he cut it back to Berbatov, whose shot from the edge of the area was parried by Cech, and Park rammed in the rebound.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>21 min:</strong> Chelsea, rattled by the injuries that have ruined their pre-match plans, and by United's surprisingly and commendably bold approach, are looking quite disoriented.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>24 min:</strong> Chelsea are trying to rally but are making no inroads into the vigorous United defence and midfield. Indeed, Rooney almost launched a quick counter-attack just now ... but passed to Terry instead.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>26 min: </strong> Malouda chases a hopeful ball and nearly recreates the goal he scored against United on his Chelsea debut in last season;s Community Shield, but this time Van der Sar got enough on the ball to divert it away. \"This is shocking our best centrehalf and our best midfielder already out and trailing 0-1,\" mourns Noor Rashid. \"To a team whose sponsors are headed up by George W. Bush! Can things get any worse.\" Stay tuned to find out, Noor.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>28 min:</strong> United's pressing is turning nasty now and they're starting to concede lots of free-kicks. Hargreaves has just clashed with Ashley Cole as the defender chased a long ball. Cole goes down as if shot, of course, and the crowd are baying for a rec card. That would have been excessive, and the ref decides a talking-to is sufficient. The free-kick is ballooned into the stand ...</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>31 min: </strong>Van der Sar has looked ropey in the little he's had to do so far and has just fumbled the ball after surging off his line to beat Joe Cole to it. Ferdinand thumps it clear, and suddenly the reason for Van der Sar's worries becomes apparent: he too is injured! On comes Kuszczak</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>34 min:</strong> It's a terrific Premier League game so far, blood and thunder stuff with a smidgin of quality to boot. Referee Mike Riley is blowing up unnecessarily far too often though. By which I meant that his use of the whistle is excessive, not that he has been spontaneously combusting on a regular basis. But hold on! Scholes has just put a trademark tackle in and cops a deserved, and inevitable, yellow card. \"Has Cech ever been the same since his injury?\" asks Ray Kelly. \"That was a fairly routine shot he spilled to Park for the goal, and he was terrible in Euro 2008.\"</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>36 min:</strong> After sustained, high-tempo probing by Chelsea, Lampard loses his patience to blem the ball at goal from 25 yards. His shot was easily blocked by a member of the United mass on front of him.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>39 min:</strong> Alex unleashes a swirler from 30-yards and Kuszczak does well to block it. He couldn't hold on to it though so was grateful that Ferdinand was on hand to whack it behind for a corner before Anelka could pounce. Terry heads the delivery from that very same corner over the bar.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>41 min:</strong> Chelsea are definitely on top now and Anelka should have plundered the equaliser. He sprung the offside trap - actually, he didn't but the linesman let him away with it - and raced through on goal before shanking high and wide from 18 yards.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>43 min:</strong> It's all Chelsea now, but United's defence is holding strong. Expect Drogba to be introduced during the break. \"Scrike is very likely is a misspelling of 'skrike', which is Norwegian for \"to cry, to scream\" which is what this half-Norwegian, half-Dane is doing over here in LA after learning that Deco is not playing and thus his guardian fantasy football team has taken a severe beating this weekend, especially with now performing-in-this-very-match-Hargreaves on the fantasy football team bench,\" blubs Christian Golding..</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>44 min:</strong> Malouda sidesteps Neville and lashes in a menacing cross, which Ferdinand, who is having a stormer, repels yet again.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>45 min:</strong> Rooney robs Terry in the middle and inspires a swift counter-attack. It breaks down, however, when Berbatov plays the ball behind Park, who would have been in on goal had the Bulgarian justified his price tag, not to mention his summer of sulking. Then Chelsea roar up the other end and Ballack draws a good save from Kuszczak with a left-footed drive from distance.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>Half-time:</strong> It's been fast and furious, quite scrappy but always engaging in that Premier League way. Despite being deprived of the spine of their team, Chelsea look good for an equaliser, particularly if Drogba replaces Anelka as he surely must. And there will certainly be a red card before the game's out.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>46 min:</strong> Ah yes, it had to happen: Drogba is on. At least he will be once he removes his bracelet, which the ref doesn't like the look of apparently. All done, here he is. \"As an Englishman who speaks Swedish (yes, I know, it is pretty pointless) I can safely say that 'skrike' is a Norwegian misappropriation of the Swedish verb 'skrika',\" huffs Julian Menz. \"Even us foreigners know that Norwegians just pretend to have their own language. It is a Swedish dialect, take the ferry to Scotland and get over it....\" (S)Crikey, stirring up some Scandinavian rivalries on a MBM. Bring it on.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>48 min:</strong> A slick move by Chelsea culminates with Anelka pulling the ball back to Joe Cole, who miscued and shot straight at Ferdinand. By the way, Drogba replaced Malouda.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>50 min:</strong> Ballack swings a sweet cross towards the back post. Drogba soars above Evra but just fails to connect. Already he's looking more lively than Anelka has done, though. As for Berbatov at the other end, he has done virtually nothing.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>51 min:</strong> Under pressure from Drogba, Kuczszak drops an Ashley Cole cross. The ref calms United by incorrectly awarding a freekick.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>53 min:</strong> Drogba's presence has convinced Chelsea to go more direct, but so far most of their long crosses have been over-hit. Meanwhile, Cristiano Ronaldo is warming up on the sideline, presumably because Ferguson, sensing an equaliser, wants to get United back on the front foot.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>55 min: </strong>Rooney, as energetic as always, strips the ball off Mikel in mid-way and bounds forward. Mikel, showing why he's not fit to lace Michael Essien's boot, just jogs gently after him. In the end it's Alex who shows enough urgency to stop Rooney's drive.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>57 min:</strong> The odds on a red card have just lengthened - Scholes has come off, replaced by a certain Cristiano Ronaldo.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>58 min:</strong> Rooney causes more bother around the Chelsea box before the ball breaks to Ronado, who lashes it miles wide from 20 yards. \"As an Englishman who happens to speak Norwegian ,\" trumpets Peter Richards. \"Skrik(et) is the title of a not entirely unknown painting by a not entirely unknown Norwegian artist, Edvard Munch. QED\"</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>59 min:</strong> Anelka, who has been deployed more on the left since Drogba's arrival, scorches past Neville, who responds by chopping him down in outrageous fashion. Hes lucky to get away with a yellow card.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>60 min:</strong> Berbatov barges Ballack to the ground, presumably just to show hes still on the pitch. The ref provides further proof, giving the Bulgarian a yellow card. United's increasing foul rate is a measure of Chelsea's increasing dominance, though the home side are still not being truly incisive. They are missing Deco.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>62 min:</strong> Ronaldo relives the pressure on United by coming back to dive around the box. Shamefully, Mike Riley falls for it and offers United a freekick. Ridiculous.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>64 min:</strong> Lots of lots of stoppages as the ref continues to award freekicks even for the slightest misdemeanours and, indeed, for nothing. It all has the effect of stemming Chelsea's momentum; a lack of crispness in Chelsea's passing is also a contributory factor.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>66 min:</strong> Another great chance for Joe Cole and another awful miss! Ballack undid the defence with a rudimentary chip over the top and Cole collected it and ran into the box before shotting straight at the keeper!</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>67 min:</strong> Scholes and Neville's recklessness seems to be infectious, for Mikel has just been booked for an anarchic lunge on Ronado. The free's in a dangerous position too, just outside the box. Seemingly intent on revenge, Ronaldo bangs it into Mikel in the wall! It goes behind for a corner, only United's second of the match.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>70 min:</strong> Mikel nicks the ball off Ronaldo but then just lumps it forward in the hope Drogba will bustle his way past the entire United defence. Chelsea have lacked guile today and no mistake.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>72 min: </strong>Bosingwa races down the right and whips in a good low cross. Anelka's connection is all wrong and the ball trickles wide off the striker from 10 yards.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>73 min: IT'S THE WORST MISS OF THE SEASON! ABSOLUTELY LAUGHABLE!</strong> Joe Cole found space on the right and lashed it across the face of goal. With Kuszczak stranded, all the unmarked Anelka had to do was prod the ball into the net from five yards ... but somehow he let it run between his legs and out to safety!</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>74 min:</strong> Substitution: Kalou on for Ballack; O'Shea on for Park.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>75 min:</strong> Joe Cole performs a scissors-kick on Ferdinand and, for reasons known only to Mike Riley, escapes without a card.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>78 min:</strong> United got large numbers forward for the first time in th second half and were almost rewarded with a goal. Ronaldo hurtled down the left and crossed low and hard. Arriving late towards the back stick, Rooney fired it into the side-netting.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>79 min: </strong>Rooney becomes the fifth United player to be booked, this time for a late challenge on Ashley Cole.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Chelsea 1-1 United (Kalou 79')</strong></p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>79 min:</strong> From the free-kick following Rooney's foul on Ashley Cole, Mikel floated the ball into the six-yard box. Kuszczak elected not to come for it, and so apparently did United's defenders. The unmarked Kalou was able to head into the corner of the net from five yards.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>81 min:</strong> After a lightning Chelsea attack, Neville does well to stretch and divert a Kalou shot out for a corner. Then Evans also excels, bravely blocking a Drogba blockbuster.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>83 min:</strong> United are on the rack, and a buoyant Chelsea sense blood ...</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>84 min:</strong> Fletcher and Ronaldo combine superbly to create a rare opening at the other end before Alex hurls himself at the Scot's shot to block it with his face!</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>86 min:</strong> It's booking No6 for United as Evra is cautioned for some injustice done to Joe Cole. Didn't quite see what. No sooner is the free-kick taken then Drogba is penalised for shoving Evans. United it hof the ball up the park, but Chelsea keep coming back ...</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>88 min:</strong> Their power and dynamism has made them the better team in this match, but still Chelsea lack poise, a fact exemplified by Joe Cole, who just shanked the ball over the bar when in a great crossing position. At this point let me remind you to check our sportblog within a few minutes of the fine whistle. There you will soon find Sean Ingle's thoughts on this game, and be provided with a free forum for sharing your own. Free, I tell you, absolutely free.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>90 min:</strong> Three more minutes to come, and at least one more good chance, I'll wager.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>90+1 min:</strong> Bosingwa rollicks forward and then clips a dainty ball to the back post with his left foot. Rooney, back helping out, heads it behind for a corner with Drogba lurking menacingly.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>90+1 min:</strong> Kalou tackles Ronaldo late. Ronaldo complains. Ronaldo is booked. For an explanation, contact Mike Riley.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>90+2 min:</strong> Er, confusion abounds here. Ferdinand clashed with Drogba on the edge of the box and the ref blew the whistle, drawing furious condemnation from Ferdinand .. who then walks off the pitch! Several players surround the ref, Alex Ferguson stomps on to the pitch .. .and eventually it becomes apparent that he match has, in fact, ended. We didn't have the designated three minutes but given how whistle-happy this ref was throughout it was perhaps fitting that the match closed in such a way. United will be happy with a point, a just reward for their bold start. Chelsea dominated thereafter but without Deco lacked cunning. The match was fierce, fast and exciting, with flair and invention rare. A typical Premier League match, you might say.</p>"
