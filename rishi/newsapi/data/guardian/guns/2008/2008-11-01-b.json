  "<p>Having been a <a href=\"http://www.visitshepherdsbush.co.uk/\">Shepherds Bush</a> resident for 17 years of my life, and becoming inured to its complete incapacity to gentrify itself (the houses between the Goldhawk and Uxbridge Roads may go for a million, but the roads themselves are, frankly, pound-shop shitholes), I was wondering what kind of effect the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/31/retail-london\">new Westfield shopping centre</a> might have on the area; and, conversely, what kind of effect the area might have on Westfield.</p> <p>To be frank, I wish the place nothing but ill. Its construction has been buggering up the traffic round there for what seems like a decade, I loathe shopping malls on principle, shopping for me being a distress activity only embarked upon when all other avenues have been exhausted, I don't like the fact that they knocked down the old burgundy-tiled Shepherd's Bush station to make way for a shinier replacement, and I am no great fan of what used to be called rampant consumerism.</p> <p>But ... but ... well, for a start the new tube station really is rather neat, large, bright, and airy; and they seem to have eliminated the wind-tunnel effect that used to freeze the marrow and play absolute havoc with one's coiffure as one ascended the escalators. As for the mall itself ... well, I was meeting my daughter there and she was trying to tell me how to get to Top Shop. \"OK, go to the Village ...\" The what? How nauseatingly inappropriate (and reminiscent of the place where <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prisoner\">Number 6</a> was imprisoned). A shopping Mall is, in effect, an anti-village; it's a place where no one lives. </p> <p>But, readers, I went to the Village, and it is hard not to be impressed. For a start, it is far larger than many English villages. It is like being in a cathedral where money is worshipped; and it's a cathedral many orders of magnitude larger than the ones where God is worshipped. Such samey blandness as the parade of shops exudes is negated by the sheer scale. It helps if you keep your gaze upwards. \"Wow, dad, it's so modern,\" said my middle child, and he was right: on that day, there was no building more contemporary available for the intimate inspection of the public. Looking up at the tesselated dome was a cross between walking through a giant space greenhouse and the inside of an insect's eyeball.</p> <p>And what a public: the place was heaving. I have walked through the new Grand Arcade in Cambridge, but that was at night and all the shops were shut; I felt as though I was walking through a designer apocalypse. The presence of people would not have improved things much, I thought; and apparently business was not good there right now. But Westfield was the busiest place I have been in since ... well, I can't remember when. The queues for the \"better\" restaurants (Nando's, Pizza Express) looked, at lunchtime, as if they wouldn't be cleared till dinner time. The next day.</p> <p>But it was in the Apple store, where the children were inspecting the company's new phones, that I had an epiphany: this is it. I am now at the epicentre of the modern world. And I don't much like it. I don't need one of these phones; I can't afford one; indeed, I can't afford anything, except some stuff from Waitrose (where we are reminded, in large writing on the walls by the check-out tills, that until 1908, the whole White City area was countryside), in the whole 40-acre, or however the hell big it is, complex.</p> <p>\"I'm going to spend every available free minute I have here,\" said my daughter, not a particularly acquisitive thirteen-year-old, \"until I know my way around with my eyes closed.\" Oh well. Good for her. But for me, I saw the future finally trundling away without me, like a bus that one realises one is too tired, too old, to carry on running after any more.</p>",
  "<p>Regular readers have seen me cite Zack Roth's fine work at TPM before, and today he delivers <a href=\"http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/11/the_anatomy_of_a_smear.php\">a strong anatomy</a> of the roll-out of the Obama's auntie story. Here's me quoting Zack who in turns quotes the AP and then returns to the narration starting with \"In other words::</p> <blockquote> <p>But note the way in which AP seems to have obtained the information. High up in the story, it reports: </p> <p>Information about the deportation case was disclosed and confirmed by two separate sources, one a federal law enforcement official. The information they made available is known to officials in the federal government, but the AP could not establish whether anyone at a political level in the Bush administration or in the McCain campaign had been involved in its release.</p> <p>In other words, it looks like someone in the Bush administration leaked the information, with the goal of throwing a last-minute wrench into Obama's campaign. And someone else confirmed it, with similar motives.</p> <p>On the record, of course, the Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, a unit of the Department of Homeland Security, is telling reporters it can't comment on any individual person's immigration status. It would appear to be a violation of department procedures, at the least, to leak such information.</p> </blockquote> <p>We'll probably never know. In the meantime, is this a big story -- the aunt's illegal status, I mean? Could make a difference of a point or two in a small number of states, I think, but in broad terms, it's no October (or November) Surprise. Which raises the broader question of why hasn't the swift-boating of Obama -- you know, the swift-boat equivalents of Ayers and Khalidi and so on -- worked its magic for the GOP the way it has in the past? This is the subject of my print column for Monday's paper. I'm sure you just can't wait!<br></p>",

It was my first time doing electronic, so I didn't mark the X strong enough, or I held down too long. Because then when I went back to check it, it had not recorded my presidential vote.</p> </blockquote> <p>So, yeah, if you're an American voter: double-check.

  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-339231749\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1892844796_EARLY-VOTING.flv\"/> </video>   <p>Four years ago, some Ohioans waited in the rain for as long as ten hours to cast their ballots in the presidential election. Thousands more waited for three, four, or five hours, and an unknown number eventually gave up.</p> <p>Caused primarily by shortages of functioning voting machines and trained poll workers, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A64737-2004Dec14?language=printer\">the long lines</a> were most likely to be found in inner cities and on college campuses, where they presented obstacles to young, poor, and minority voters.</p> <p>Ohio's Repubican secretary of state, Kenneth Blackwell, insisted that <a href=\"http://www.commondreams.org/views04/1118-30.htm\">\"every eligible voter who wanted to vote had the opportunity to vote\"</a> and quickly certified the election, despite widespread protests. At the time, Blackwell was also serving a state co-chair of George W Bush's re-election campaign.</p> <p>This year, many Ohio voters seem determined not to be burned again. In their corner is a new secretary of state, the Democrat Jennifer Brunner, who has already fended off <a href=\"http://www.democracynow.org/2008/10/9/ohio_secretary_of_state_jennifer_brunner\">a series of Republican efforts at vote suppression</a>. But thanks to a state law passed in 2006, Ohioans also have a new weapon in the fight to make sure their votes are counted: their state is now among more than 30 states that allow residents to vote early - either in person or by absentee ballot - on demand, without having to provide an excuse. In Ohio, <a href=\"http://www.alternet.org/democracy/101040/early_voting_in_ohio_begins/\">early voting began a full month prior to election day</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"http://blogs.abcnews.com/thenumbers/2008/10/new-direction-v.html\">ABC news estimated yesterday</a> that one in six eligible voters across the country had already cast ballots, and a full 35% of voters were expected to do so before election day. The sheer volume of early votes is huge, reflecting the large increase in registration. And so far, these votes are breaking heavily in favor of Obama, 59% to 40%.</p> <p>These numbers are almost a <a href=\"http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20081030/POLITICS01/810300361\">mirror image of the previous two elections</a>, where George W Bush won about 60% of early votes. Traditionally, it's older people who are most likely to vote early, but that too has changed this year. Voters of all kinds now speak of being suspicious of the voting process and wary of problems on election day. Particularly in areas plagued by such problems in the past, people are flocking to the polls early or sending in their ballots through the mail.</p> <p>The Obama campaign has mounted a massive get-out-the-early-vote effort that so far has no equivalent on the Republican side, and dozens of non-partisan groups are participating as well.</p> <p>The Guardian team encountered one such group in Columbus, Ohio, where an estimated 5,000 to 15,000 people were unable to vote in 2004 due to long lines and problems with registration data and electronic voting machines. <a href=\"http://www.votefromhome08.com/index.html\">Vote from Home</a>, staffed mainly by student volunteers, has set itself a goal of bringing in 10,000 early ballots. They are focusing especially on those most likely to have been disenfranchised in the past: the poor, inner city minorities, homeless people, and felons (who under Ohio law are allowed to vote after they serve their time).</p> <p>The group has helped register people, and now makes about a thousand phone calls a day to remind voters to cast their ballots. They also provide a free taxi service to the polls. They hope their work will ensure that no one has to wait more than a couple of hours to vote.</p> <p>Obstacles to voting probably changed the outcome of the presidential election in 2000, and possibly in 2004 as well. This army of volunteers is doing all it can to ensure that in 2008, Americans will elect the president they have chosen to elect. In an ideal America, of course, the government would provide adequate resources and safeguards to this all-important civic process, and groups like Vote from Home wouldn't have to exist at all. But in the imperfect America we inhabit today, this is what democracy looks like.</p>",

So this is a rare thing: all of the big four playing on a Saturday, three of them at 3pm, one of them at home to <em>a team called Hull who are above them in the league</em>.</p> <p>While you'd fancy Chelsea (home to Sunderland), Manchester United (home to Hull) and Arsenal (away to Rory Delap) to win, this is yet another big day in Liverpool's march to an apparently pre-ordained 19th title, 19 years after the last one. They visit a rejuvenated Tottenham at 5.30pm: a gimme two weeks ago, but a really tricky test now. But that's for Scott Murray later in the day. In the meantime, we've got Everton v Fulha<em>COME BACK</em>m now, and then all those 3pm kick-offs.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>12.42pm</strong> \"I've got a feeling about this game\" says Andy Gray, taking Sky's predilection for overhyping even the most unpolished of wotsits to new levels of indignity. It's Everton v Fulham for heaven's sake!</p> <p>\"Morning Rob,\" says Alex Netherton. \"'Human frailty, it makes me sick sometimes.' Oh wait, I mean Danny Murphy.\" For some reason, and in spite of little factors like a) him scoring the winner at Old Trafford three years in four, b) him being Danny Murphy and c) see a), I've always had a soft spot for Danny Murphy. Such a classily unobtrusive footballer, not unlike myself, and despite disturbing reports of shell suits, generally someone with more going on between the lugholes than most footballers. </p> <p>Big big congratulations, incidentally, to my nephew Ciaran, who today passed his 11+ with flying colours. He's already the brainbox of the Smyth family; well, look at the competition. He's off to celebrate with fizzy pop and pizza. Imagine being 11 again!</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>12.47pm</strong> They've kicked off. \"Afternoon, Rob,\" says Declan. Folk are so polite today. \"Have you heard the backing track to Parry &amp; Gray's team analysis on the Goodison tannoy? Not one, not two but <em>three</em> execrable 70s stylee, \"Everton, Everton\" themes. Z-Cars to follow, thankfully.\"</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong> Whip on your anorak, let's have us a party, woo-hoo</strong> I found a great stat yesterday. Eric Cantona is the fastest to 50 assists since football began, in 1992, having done so in 96 games. And the second-fastest in 99 matches? Not Henry, Cole, Bergkamp, Giggs or Lyttle, but Mikel Arteta.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>12.53pm</strong> Nothing has happened so far. Sweet diddly. <em>Nothing</em>. These sides are a point apart in the bottom half of the league, although Fulham, with 11 to Everton's 12, have a game in hand. Everton, perversely, have yet to win at home this season; Fulham, predictably, are yet to win away.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>12.57pm</strong> The first half-chance of the game. Cahill on the left waited for Arteta to overlap before sliding the ball down the line. Arteta then cut a cross back to the near post, where Pienaar's flicked header went straight at Schwarzer.</p> <p>There's a fairly open, almost lazy feel to the game, with both sides lacking an orthodox cruncher in the centre of midfield (Fulham have Bullard and Murphy; Everton have Fellaini and Osman), but so far neither side has found anything resembling a rhythm.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>1.01pm</strong> Alan Parry makes the inevitable comparison between Fellaini, who for the uninitiated sports some Spandex-tight corkscrew curls, and the Scousers in Harry Enfield. Still, at least we had 13 minutes' grace before he could wait no longer to tickle the nation's ribs. Still not much going on. It's not a negative game, or even an especially poor one. It's just a game between two mediocre sides.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>1.08pm</strong> \"Just one question,\" says Gary Naylor. \"Why?\" Well nobody told me that scented string vests had gone out of fash- oh hang on, there's a bit before that from Naylor. \"I hope nobody in the crowd is too hungover - just one look at that purple and yellow ball would induce vomit from the strongest stomach.\" Do they not always use them?</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>1.10pm</strong> What I said at 1.01pm was a lie. This is poor. It's still open - only four fouls in the first quarter, as Andy Gray points out in what is in no way an attempt to justify his pre-match assertion that he had a feeling about the game - but there's a startling lack of quality.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>1.13pm</strong> \"Afternoon Rob,\" says Neill Brown. \"Like you, I am at work today. And, like you, I am staring at a screen with nothing interesting going on (accrual spreadsheets since you didn't ask). Still, as Arsene Wenger's considered a top manager, I'm going to follow his example and give up work 15 minutes early today because apparently my work will all be done by then.\" Is that funny? I honestly can't tell anymore.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>1.14pm</strong> Can you be done for plagiarising yourself? Because really all I want to do is repeat the 1.10pm entry. Bullard scrunches another one wide from distance. Fulham have played some unpleasant stuff in midfield, but up front they have nothing. Well, they have Andy Johnson and Bobby Zamora. So, yeah, nothing.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>1.15pm</strong> Fellaini, who clearly has quite the eye for goal, picks up a loose ball on the edge of the box and almost passes it onto the near post. It bounces clear and, just as Yakubu is about to blast inexplicably over an open net from six yards, Aaron Hughes nips in front of him splendidly to clear.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>1.19pm</strong> Big chance for Fulham. Bullard curves in a lovely cross from the right to Zamora six yards out. His header is smothered by Howard, but the ball breaks to Johnson on the edge of the six-yard box. Instead of shooting, he decides to pause, consider the meaning of life, stick his hands on his hips in the camp style and then smoke a nice cigar. By the time he's done so, the chance has gone.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>1.20pm</strong> Now <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0dghVN8ZWw\">this</a> is funny. That much I do know.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>1.25pm</strong> <br>Here's Gary Naylor. \"Is it me or is the quality of football in the Premier League and Champions League poorer this year than for a few seasons? Liverpool are the leading team, but haven't really played well consistently, there's no one player who is outstanding and the crises in goalkeeping and refereeing have produced more goals than moments of sublime skill. After a splendid Euro 2008, the fare on offer in the Premier League looks very second best. The hype merchants keep telling us that club football is better than international football, but it's not.\" I think Euro 2008 was a fluke, glorious though it was, and that football generally is much poorer than it was back in the day. Goalkeeping is at a particularly low ebb. In fact so is humanity, but goalkeeping especially.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>1.27pm</strong> Filth. Abject filth. \"What's currently puzzling me is why there is a group of what appears to be about 20 red-uniformed Chelsea pensioners near the corner flag on Everton's left wing,\" says Declan. \"Have they invaded? Or maybe defected?\" You couldn't really call them glory-hunters, could you. What's the phrase for when you downgrade teams?</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>1.29pm</strong> Hangeland uses Fellaini like he's a Krypton Factor prop, jumping all over him in the penalty area. As Andy Gray says, 99 times out of 100 that's a free-kick outside the area, but the ref, Lee Mason, wasn't interested in giving what, technically, was a clear penalty.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>1.31pm</strong> \"Re: Naylor at 1.25pm,\" begins Neill Brown. \"The outstanding player of the season so far is Frank Lampard. Make of that what you will.\" Lampard remains farcically underrated, mainly because people can't see the wood for their own <em>trees of hate and envy</em>. I think Lampard's the greatest/most influential player in Chelsea's history, although I realise that, with their modest past, that's not a million miles from winning a 'best moment on Soccer AM' competition.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>1.34pm: Half-time: Everton 0-0 Fulham</strong> I look forward to seeing Richard Keys talk this one up. It was garbage. Everton were the least-worst: Fellaini hit the post and then should have had a penalty when Hangeland put his hands where he shouldn't in the penalty box. But it was a half of depressingly low quality. Still, come back in 15 minutes! It'll be better! Honest! Please!</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>1.36pm</strong> \"Yo yo Robert,\" says Alex Perkins. \"Fellaini is a dead ringer (yes, pun intended) for Dustin Diamond aka Screech from TV's Saved by the Bell.\" I was more a My So-Called Life kinda gal.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>1.48pm</strong> \"In no way was I discrediting Lampard, Rob,\" says Neill Brown. \"My point was that he has stood out in a spectacular fashion in all of Chelsea's games so far but has only looked decent in the international games. I think Gary has a good argument as to the quality of international v club football.\" Oh I wasn't having a go at you \u2013 if I was I'd have slipped in an eff and a cee and some lame joke based on your surname \u2013 but just making a general observation.</p> <p>I totally disagree that international football is better, though. Most of the big teams are all over the show at the moment, and England would get hammered by any of the big four. Heskey, Torres, Berbatov, Drogba or Adebayor? Case closed, Columbo.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>1.50pm</strong> The fun's over and the second half has started. \"In this instance, they're more dumpster divers than glory hunters,\" says Ben Smith of those blokes mentioned in the first half.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>1.51pm</strong> It's an indictment of how poor international football is, in fact, that Andy Johnson has played it. He's done nothing today except wear premature baldness with elan.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>1.55pm</strong> Big chance for Everton. Arteta's stepover on the left gives him half a yard against Pantsil, who doesn't really those last two letters given how well he performs, and he kisses a lovely cross to the back post where Cahill, charging in among the bodies, thumps a header over from six yards. For a finisher of his quality, that was close to a sitter.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>1.58pm</strong> One of the Sky mics picks up somebody - no idea who - using the phrase \"effing ballboys\". That's the Daily Mail's front-page story for Monday sorted.</p> <p>\"'What's the phrase for when you downgrade teams?' quotes Gary Naylor. \"Is it 'I've decided to support my local team' (spoken in a Bristol accent)?\" That's not as good as your Welsh accent.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>2.01pm</strong> The odd thing about this game is not that it's been garbage - welcome to the Premier League, ladies and germs - but that it's been so lethargic. For Fulham, so poor away from home, that's fair enough: a draw is a draw is a draw. But for Everton it's less explicable, especially given how they got in among Manchester United last week. They are, as someone once said, cheating their manager.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>2.02pm</strong> Gera hits the bar, but he should have scored. A corner from the right went all the way across the box, from where Zamora hung up a delightful ball for Gera, running in unmolested, to thump a header off the bar from six yards. Unlike Cahill a few minutes ago he was under no pressure, and had more momentum from his run, so that goes down as a criminal miss.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>2.05pm</strong> \"Lampard is underrated that's true, but is he really better than Gianfranco Zola?\" says George Templeton. \"I know I haven't watched football for as long as many people and I am no Chelsea fan, but Zola was magnificent and from what I've seen/read, was magnificent most of the time he graced the pitch for Chelsea?\" That he was but \u2013 and I know this isn't the answer to everything \u2013 look at their medals' cabinets. Fwank has been the most important attacking player in by far the best period in Chelsea's history, which will do for me. It's official: I Heart Fwank.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>2.06pm</strong> Everton substitution: Saha on for Fellaini, a decision greeted with widespread boos. Cahill will drop back into midfield, with Saha going up top. Fellaini has been pretty impressive, but I understand the decision: Osman is the nominal sitting player, so he had to stay on, and Cahill is such a goal threat that he wanted to keep him on. Cahill and Fellaini isn't a realistic centre-midfield pairing.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>2.08pm</strong> The feistometer has gone up a notch or two: 1, 2, 3, 4 you might say. First Johnson left a foot in on his old team-mate Osman, and now Schwarzer feels the joy of Yakubu's boot after he dropped a cross.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>2.12pm</strong> If every single attacker on the pitch did not require post-it notes to enable them to distinguish between elbow and derriere, it would be about 3-3 because the defences remain open. Cahill puts in a sly leg-deadener on Bullard: the ball was still sort of there, enough to make it look like an honest attempt to play the ball, but he knew what he was doing. But Bullard is up and looks fine now.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>2.15pm</strong> Bullard shoots, at a conservative estimate, 974 miles wide. In fact that whooshed so far wide that I think it went back in time.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>2.16pm</strong> Some team news for Middlesbrough v West Ham yeah?<br> <strong>Middlesbrough</strong> Turnbull, Wheater, Riggott, Pogatetz, Taylor, Aliadiere, O'Neil, Digard, Downing, Sanli, Alves. Subs: Jones, Hoyte, Mido, Emnes, Arca, Adam Johnson, Grounds. </p> <p><strong>West Ham</strong> Green, Neill, Collins, Upson, Ilunga, Faubert, Collison, Mullins, Boa Morte, Bellamy, Sears. Subs: Walker, Lopez, Etherington, Tristan, Bowyer, Tomkins, Di Michele.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>2.17pm</strong> The wodwork is hit for the third time today. Bullard coaxes a lovely free-kick over the wall which Howard, diving across goal from left to right, can only fist straight out in front of him. It comes to Zamora, inside the six-yard box but at a slight angle, and he can only scuff it across goal, past the two defenders running back, and onto the far post. A pretty pith-poor effort, in truth.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>Portsmouth v Wigan team news</strong></p> <p><strong>Portsmouth</strong> James, Johnson, Campbell, Distin, Belhadj, Diop, Diarra, Davis, Armand Traore, Crouch, Defoe.

Subs: Pollitt, Taylor, Scharner, Kilbane, Brown, De Ridder, Camara.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>2.21pm</strong> Anichebe on for Pienaar. \"I'm quite happy with Fellaini and Cahill as a centre-midfield pairing with one going and one staying dependent on the play, but it won't work with Osman, Arteta and Pienaar as the other three,\" says Gary Naylor. \"We need the Lee Carsley role as defensive midfielder sorting out as there's no player in the club suited to playing there. Under Moyes, Everton have played their best football in a 4-1-3-1-1 formation, with the first of those \"1\"s allowing the other \"3-1-1\" to play.\" I agree completely about Carsley, but surely you couldn't play Fellaini in a straight 4-4-2, which is what they're playing with Saha and Yakubu on. Or could you?</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>Altrincham v Histon team news</strong></p> <p><strong>Altrincham</strong> Coburn, Lane, McGregor, Young, Densmore, Doughty, Lawton, Danylyk, Senior, Little, Elam.

He humped it downfield and, as Mark Schwarzer came to collect, Yakubu eased his not inconsiderable backside into Schwarzer - manoeuvre that has served man very well on Carling-stained dancefloors but here only produces a foul: it sends Schwarzer flying in the comedy style and allows the ball to plop into the net. They wouldn't have given that for the home side down the road, never mind at Goodison.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>Man Utd v Hull team news</strong> The best midfielder in England, Michael Carrick, returns for his first game in almost two months.</p> <p><strong>Man Utd</strong> Van der Sar, Neville, Ferdinand, Vidic, Evra, Ronaldo, Carrick, Anderson, Nani, Berbatov, Rooney.

The excellent Osman pings in a lovely dipping cross from the right and Saha, seven yards out, nails a firm header to the right of Schwarzer, who gets a hand on it but can only help it into the net. That's harsh on Fulham in truth, but Everton will not give a flyer, and nor should we as - thank goodness - this game is nearly over.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>2.38pm. Full time: Everton 1-0 Fulham</strong> So Everton finally win their first home game of the season and, almost absurdly given the gloom surrounding the club of late, move up to seventh for the time being. They are still not playing well, but it does seem that that well-earned draw against Manchester United was a turning point. Since then they have claimed two wins and, almost more importantly given their early-season travails, two clean sheets.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>2.41pm</strong> \"Ah the medals argument which I will counter with the money argument,\" says George Templeton. \"Zola was never in a team that spent the kind of cash and thusly had the glittering array of talent that Lampard has been surrounded with. No doubt Lampard has been one of the key figures of Chelsea's reign at or near the top, but don't you think Zola could've just as well if Chelsea had a sugar daddy owner like they do now. My argument is that if Zola had the opportunity to play as many big matches as Lampard, he would've come up trumps just as many if not more times. Admittedly my judgement might be clouded by his performance against England. But look at us, neither one of us are Chelsea fans and we're debating this, I wonder what they think?\" That, alas, would require <em>more than two people to be reading this</em>, but fair play for trying.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>2.52pm</strong> \"I'm trying to concentrate on designing a newsletter for a firm of Property Consultants, but Danylyk listed in the starting line up for Altrincham?

Sorry about that: I just poured coffee all down my silk pink waistcoat in hilarious fashion.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>3.05pm: Manchester United 1-0 Hull (Ronaldo 3)</strong> Reality is starting to sink its seriously sharp teeth into Hull's collective dusters. That goal was devastatingly simple: Berbatov played the ball infield from the right and Ronaldo, back to goal, controlled it with his right foot and then turned to sweep it in off the near post with his left from 18 yards. An excellent, precise finish, and <em>he even smiled</em>. It's his sixth of the season. Who says he can't get 42 again?</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>3.06pm</strong> \"As a follow up,\" says James Sparling, \"you might be interested to read that <a href=\"http://www.football.co.uk/altrincham_town/players/anthony_danylyk_115516.shtml\">Danylyk's stats</a> give a new meaning to the whole size zero debate... He is the oldest, shortest and lightest person in existence.\"</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>3.13pm: Rory Delap 1-0 Arsenal (Fuller 11)</strong> Delap's first long throw brings the first goal, headed in by Ricardo Fuller. That was absurdly simple: the throw missed out the hordes at the near post and found Fuller, one one one against Toure at the back post. Fuller climbed all over Toure, legitimately so, and planted a header into the corner from five yards.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>3.14pm: West Brom 0-1 Blackburn (McCarthy 13pen</strong> \"Losses after 86-match unbeaten runs at home are like buses coming as they do all at once,\" says Ian Copestake, \"so I fully expect Chelsea to lose again today. However, there is a Sunderland shaped hole in this scenario.\" Chelsea are, as you'd expect, all over Sunderland like a cheap one, but haven't had too many dangerous efforts as yet.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>3.21pm: Middlesbrough 0-1 West Ham (Mullins 18)</strong> How contrary are Middlesbrough? They get results when you never expect them to and then go 1-0 down to West Ham. And Hayden Mullins. He smacked it in off the bar after making a mess of the chance originally, and West Ham have a decent chance of ending their run of four straight defeats. In other news, at Fratton Park, Peter Crouch has hit the bar for Portsmouth against Wigan.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>3.23pm: Man Utd 1-1 Hill (Cousin 23)</strong> Reality has just snapped one of its front teeth on Hull's rock-hard swingers: they've equalised through Daniel Cousin! Vidic was penalised for having a feel of Marlon Link's polyester and, from the inswinging free-kick by Andy Dawson, Cousin flicked a superb header across Van Der Sar and into the corner. That's a really good goal.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>3.29pm: Chelsea 1-0 Sunderland (Alex 27)</strong> Chelsea resume normal service: Alex scores their 1000th Premier League goal from a distance of approximately 0.4 yards. The lovely thing about this is that it was from open play and yet it's the centre-back who scores: Alex gave it to Lampard 40 yards out and kept running. It eventually went to Joe Cole, who cut in from the right and drove it goalwards with his left foot. Fulop couldn't hold it, plunging to his left, and Alex did the rest, although he might just have been offside when Cole had the shot.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>3.31pm: Manchester United 2-1 Hull (Carrick 29)</strong> England's best midfielder, Michael Carrick, scores a fine goal. It was a beautiful counter-attack, starting with Vidic just outside his own six-yard box. He found Rooney, he found Berbatov, he found Carrick, and he took two touches on the run before sweeping a daisy-cutter across Myhill and in off the post from 17 yards. Lovely stuff, with shades of Andrei Kanchelskis's semi-legendary goal at Carrow Road in April 1993, particularly in the way that it began with a first-time 40-yard pass from the centre of defence.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>3.32pm: Chelsea 2-0 Sunderland (Anelka 30)</strong> Nicolas Anelka seals the game for Chelsea. Already. Lampard crossed, Alex took a touch and Anelka - coming from what looked like an offside position - stole the chance from him like that little git used to do in the playground, scoring from a few yards.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>3.36pm</strong> Anyone out there?</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>3.38pm</strong> Benni McCarthy has been sent off at West Brom for two yellow cards - he hadn't been booked for over a year before that - and Paul Ince is going ballistic. The second was for deliberate handball. \"Anelka is a goal thief!\" screams George Templeton, as if this were the height of deviancy.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>3.42pm</strong> Charles Antaki isn't in a good place, all told. \"What's the point trying to listen out for an Arsenal equaliser while working on my FreeCell average?

Arsene knows!</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>3.46pm: Man Utd 3-1 Hull (Ronaldo 44)</strong> Just 35 to go now. Nani's outswinging corner is thumped in by the head of Cristiano Ronaldo at the near post. United have been excellent, and the pasting that United have threatened to dish out all season may be coming Hull's way.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>3.47pm: Portsmouth 0-1 Wigan (Zaki 45pen)</strong> Papa Bouba Diop gives away another stupid penalty, tripping over Titus Bramble just as Bramble was about to lump the ball out of the ground. Amr Zaki whacks it straight down the middle for his ninth of the season.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>3.48pm: Chelsea 3-0 Sunderland (Anelka 45)</strong> Chelsea score a goal that isn't offside, with Anelka ending an excellent move to grab his second of the game.</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>3.51pm</strong> So, the half-time scores.</p> <p>Chelsea 3-0 Sunderland (1-0 if you only count goals that are onside)<br>Man Utd 3-1 Hull<br>Middlesbrough 0-1 West Ham<br>Portsmouth 0-1 Wigan<br>Rory Delap 1-0 Arsenal<br>West Brom 0-1 Blackburn</p> <p>And in the evening kick-off it's Spurs 0-1 Liverpool.

He is unstoppable, yes, but only one game in every 50. And his short passing game \u2013 the most important thing in a midfielder where I come from \u2013 is non-existent.</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>4.06pm</strong> Roy Keane has made a half-time substitution, bringing on El-Hadji Diouf for Martyn Waghorn. Sadly the horse, unlike Triggs, is not going come back the moment Roy calls it. And apparently Keane has been sent to the stands, probably for pointing out, maybe in creative language, that the first two goals were offside.</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>4.09pm</strong> \"Hi Rob,\" says Russell George, procrastinating from his work, Oxford, it says here. \"I once shamelessly stole a goal from a team mate during a cub match. I honestly thought it was OK to run 30 years to tap home a shot that was trickling in anyway, and didn't understand the reaction of my team mate afterwards. If Richard (I think) who played for the Thaxted Panthers around 1985 is reading this, I'm sorry. It was a title decider, and I realised at an early age that this might be as good as it got. I was right.\" You ran 30 <em>years</em>. Firing up the DeLorean for a smidgin of self-validation is pretty tragic.</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>4.11pm: Chelsea 4-0 Sunderland (Fwank 51)</strong> Fwank scores his customary goal, but this is bigger than most: it's his 100th in league football. It was all about Joe Cole, really. He skinned McCartney on the right of the box and stood up a lovely ball to the back post. Fwank, six yards out, strained his neck muscles and eased his header to the right of Fulop.</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>4.14pm: Chelsea 5-0 Sunderland (Anelka 53)</strong> Any camerman worth his salt would focus on Roy Keane's phizog right now, but for the time being they're showing repeats of Anelka's hat-trick goal. Malouda broke down the left and played it across the face of goal for Anelka, eight yards out, to stretch and stab it in via the goalkeeper Fulop. Now they cut to Keane, who is sat in the stands and chewing his gum with a ferocity that makes it seem like the most foreboding thing in the history of the world. I don't think Wrigley's will be offering him a deal.</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>4.16pm: West Brom 1-1 Blackburn (Bednar 55)</strong> We've waited a long, long time for Roy Keane's meltdown. I think there might be some post-match fun(k) today.</p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>4.18pm: Man Utd 4-1 Hull (Vidic 57)</strong> Nemanja Vidic volleys United into a surely unassailable three-goal lead. It was a corner from the right, by Rooney this time, and Vidic at the near post bundled it first-time under Myhill from about eight yards.</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>4.21pm</strong> \"Russell George (4:09pm) didn't use his DeLorean,\" says Mac Millings. \"I heard he actually played cub football for 30 years before finally scoring. Which was not only sad but, by the end, a little creepy.\"</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>4.22pm: West Brom 2-1 Blackburn (Miller 62)</strong> A screamer from Ishmael Miller has put West Brom in front against ten-man Blackburn. Here's an email from Qasim Nauman, who has chosen to presume that our tens of readers already know which team he supports. \"I was following the scores of the United and Chelsea matches, until I realised the utter pointlessness of it all: our main competitors this season are Villa, Man City, and maybe Hull for fourth place, especially considering that Alexandre Song is our midfield 'enforcer'.\" Not replacing Flamini was inexplicable. Still, Arsene knows!</p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p><strong>4.26pm</strong> \"I don't know if you've got Five Live on for the United game but Jan Molby's accent never fails to amuse,\" says Michael Gibbons. \"Like when you mix blue and yellow to get green, it appears if you whisk up Scouse and Danish in a blender you get what sounds like a Dutch morph (little plasticine bloke from Tony Hart's seminal Heartbeat).\" It is, without question, the best hybrid accent ever, although I probably wouldn't want to hear it during pillow talk.</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>4.29pm: Man Utd 4-2 Hull (Mendy 69)</strong> Insert your own patronising comment about Hull's spirit here. They never give up, mind: Evra's back header is short and Bernard Mendy - who gave away 12 penalties and scored 14 own-goals in one pre-season friendly - puts something back in the bank by lobbing high over Van Der Sar. Vidic hooked it away from under the bar on the volley but it was definitely over the line.</p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>4.31pm</strong> Distin and Crouch both head against the bar in the space of about five seconds.</p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p><strong>4.34pm: Rory Delap 2-0 Arsenal (Olofinjana 73)</strong> Oh dear, oh dear. This is a shambles for Arsenal. It was another long throw, flicked on by Fuller (I think). It found Olofinjana, who was six yards out and started staggering before falling over like somebody who'd been in Wetherspoons since midday. As he did so, the ball hit at least two parts of his body, one of which might have been his hand, before scooting past Almunia. \"He's scored it with his tits!\" exclaims Scott Murray across the desk.</p> <!-- Block 82 --> <p><strong>4.37pm: Robin Van Persie sent off</strong> Arsenal are having the definitive shocker. Van Persie, only just on as a substitute, is given a straight red for a minor assault on the Stoke keeper Sorensen. You know that thing in Fifa 98 when, if you were in a funk, you could just hump the keeper up in the air and get a straight red card? Basically Van Persie did that, thudding into him with his shoulder as Sorensen picked the ball up. Sorensen must wonder what he has done to offend north London, after Alan Hutton rearranged his eye a couple of weeks ago. Arsene Wenger must wonder how on earth Arsenal have tossed away five points - and with it, surely, the title - this week. Still, Arsene knows!</p> <!-- Block 83 --> <p><strong>4.39pm</strong> \"Speaking of hybrid accents,\" said Qasim Nauman, \"anyone remember Thomas Hitzlesperger's German + Brummie linguistic alloy?\" Remember it? His post-match interview against Villa in 2003 is the most played MP3 on my iPod.</p> <!-- Block 84 --> <p><strong>4.42pm: Man Utd 4-3 Hull (Geovanni 81pen)</strong> This is a joke. United were 4-1 up but Hull are showing remarkable resilience. Ferdinand is penalised for winning a battle of strength with Mendy - there was a tangle of legs but I'm not sure Ferdinand was any more or less culpable than Mendy - and Geovanni does the necessary from the spot.</p> <!-- Block 85 --> <p><strong>4.43pm: Middlesbrough 1-1 West Ham (Mido 83)</strong> Seriously, though: 4-3. W. T. Eff.</p> <!-- Block 86 --> <p><strong>4.44pm: Portsmouth 1-1 Wigan (Kranjcar 82)</strong> Portsmouth get a deserved equaliser, through Niko Kranjcar, after battering Wigan in the second half. At Old Trafford, Wayne Rooney is apparently lucky not to be sent off after having a hack at both Boateng and Ashbee.</p> <!-- Block 87 --> <p><strong>4.45pm: West Brom 2-2 Blackburn (Andrews 89)</strong> Ten-man Blackburn have equalised through Keith Andrews, and <em>if one more person on an unnamed football forum says it's 4-4 at Old Trafford I'm going to remake Falling Down in a postmodern fashion</em>. It's isn't 4-4, it's 4-3. But it's all Hull. I genuinely can't take this.</p> <!-- Block 88 --> <p><strong>Full time: Chelsea 5-0 Sunderland</strong> But the best bit - Roy Keane's post-match press conference - might yet be to come. At Stoke, Theo Walcott is being stretchered off with what looks like it could be a serious shoulder injury, so Arsenal are down to nine men, and they'll be nine points off the pace when Liverpool win 1-0 at Tottenham later in the day.</p> <!-- Block 89 --> <p><strong>4.54pm: Rory Delap 2-1 Arsenal</strong> A twice-deflected free-kick from Gael Clichy is surely no more than a consolation for nine-man Arsenal.</p> <!-- Block 90 --> <p><strong>Full time: Manchester United 4-3 Hull</strong> Don't ever put me through that again. Ever.</p> <!-- Block 91 --> <p><strong>4.56pm: Portsmouth 1-2 Wigan (Heskey 90)</strong> That is ridiculous. Portsmouth have hit the woodwork four times, but Emile Heskey has stolen it for Wigan in the final minute, with his 100th Premier League goal from just 9,412,412,723,129 shots.</p> <!-- Block 92 --> <p><strong>Full time: Portsmouth 1-2 Wigan</strong> Twilight robbery.</p> <!-- Block 93 --> <p><strong>Full time: Rory Delap 2-1 Arsenal</strong> Didn't see that one coming, did you?

  "<p>Ever since Nick Leeson spectacularly bankrupted Baring's Bank in 1995 as a result of $1.4bn losses on his unauthorised derivative trades there has been a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jan/24/europeanbanks.banking\">steady stream of similar unauthorised trades</a> and large losses. In 1996 Sumitomo lost $2.6bn on unauthorised copper trades, in 2006 Austria's BAWAG lost $2.4bn from unuthorised currency trading.</p> <p>In September 2007 Credit Agricole reported a loss of \u20ac250m from unauthorised trades and in January this year Societe Generale lost \u20ac4.9bn as a result of \u20ac50bn unauthorised trades by Jerome Kerviel. The latest additions to this list came last week when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/feedarticle/7961856\">Groupe Caisse D'Epargne</a>, one of France's biggest mutual savings banks announced losses of \u20ac600m from unauthorised equity derivatives trading and <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/b65d9e52-9eaa-11dd-98bd-000077b07658.html\">Citic Pacific</a>, based in Hong Kong announced losses of over $1bn from unauthorized currency trading. </p> <p>It is tempting to say \"serves them right\" if the banks were foolish enough to allow a bunch of rogue traders to run up such massive losses but the huge irony in these losses, and the much larger recent losses from authorised trading in mortgage and credit derivatives is that all the major banks have in place \"risk control\" departments that are meant to monitor all positions and ensure that banks are not exposed to excessive levels of risk.</p> <p>The clear implication of both the rogue traders and the large losses on authorised trades is the banks' risk control departments either do not know what they are doing or have no fool proof way of avoiding either systemic trading risk or rogue traders. Rogue traders capture attention when markets are normal but the systemic risk problem is clearly the more serious of the two, not least because of the huge sums of money involved in recent losses and write-downs. Most, if not all, the banks involved believed that the business and the trades they were engaged in were essentially sound and, if not risk-free, at least that the business risks were understood and controlled for. This confidence must now seen to be fundamentally misplaced. </p> <p>Although they had sophisticated mathematical models in place which estimated the level of risk under a range of different possibilities, the range was clearly inadequate. What has happened is that the banks had models which allowed for defaults or losses of a specified level, say 10%, 15% or 20%, but failed to incorporate the possibility that the level of defaults could run to 40% or 50% and the losses to 70% or 80% or more. In the auction to unwind the credit default swap trades undertaken by Lehman Brothers, the average sum estimated to be recoverable from the trades by creditors was under 9% of the value of the swaps. Someone is going to have to pick up the other 90%+ of potential losses.</p> <p>They may, of course, argue like John Meriwether and Long Term Capital Management, who lost $4.6bn in derivative trading in 1998 and nearly brought down the financial system, that the events which took place could not have been reasonably anticipated. In the case of LTCM it was an unexpected combination of Russian defaults and credit crisis. But this is precisely the problem. The models in place only allowed for a restricted range of foreseen risks. Indeed, it is doubtful whether they can allow for the range of possible outcomes. What they have done is to model the predictable, not the unpredictable, such as a major counter-party going under.</p> <p>All this points in one direction. Most banks and trading houses are incapable of operating risk control systems of sufficient sophistication to minimise systemic trading risk. This is because the really severe risks are potentially unknowable and complex derivative trading simply magnifies the risks, creating what Warren Buffett perceptively termed \"weapons of mass financial destruction\". This suggests that if banks are unable to do it then risk controls will have to be put in place by national and international regulators, primarily in the form of limiting the degree and scale of risk that can be undertaken and the nature of the instruments that can be created and traded.</p> <p>The mathematicians and rocket scientists in the banks have had their fun. The central banks are now picking up the pieces of their failed ventures. It is time to consider how to limit the risks of some forms of derivative trading. It may be that all trades should be notified to a central trading registry, some derivatives should be banned outright, and others should have to have a risk premium paid to the regulatory agencies as an insurance against potential default. What is certain is that risk assement is too important to be left to the market participants alone. We are living with the legacy of that failure.</p>",
  "<p>Last month I wrote about the first and only <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/sep/22/fashion.middleeast\">Palestinian keffiyeh scarf factory</a>, which is struggling to survive even though this symbol of the Palestinian national struggle went from anti-war accessory to high street fashion item. </p> <p>I mentioned that, although the black-and-white chequered scarf has gleaned serious fashion stripes, it was slammed in some quarters as being an <a href=\"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2008/jun/01/dunkin-in-a-kerfuffle/\">endorsement of terror</a>. Back then, Israel didn't go for the scarf as fashion item, which I'd assumed was because the keffiyeh's unequivocal political significance was just a bit too close for comfort. But now women have started wearing the scarf in a fashion-y manner, while some of Tel Aviv's boutiques have draped the scarf, fashionista style, around shop window mannequins. </p> <p>\"I think it looks nice, that's why I wear it,\" says one 23-year-old woman in Tel Aviv who is channelling the scarf much like the American celebrity chef <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/chi-rachael-ray-dunkin-donuts,0,6304563.story\">Rachael Ray</a> did for a subsequently banned advert earlier this year. \"We learned it was fashionable from Europe,\" says 18-year-old Kineret, at a central shopping centre, also sporting the keffiyeh as street-trend. Both of these women say they know what the scarf represents and are not wearing it as a political statement. </p> <p>But why the time delay? It's not a seasonal issue, since Israeli teenage girls were wearing fashion-conscious vest-and-cotton-scarf combinations in the stickiest summer months. It's not fashion tardiness, either: Israel may once have had a time-lag in keeping up with global trends, but this is definitely not the case today. </p> <p>\"We saw the trend happen, everywhere, we saw the scarf being worn in a lovely way, as fun, street fashion,\" says Merav Frank, deputy fashion editor at the popular women's weekly, La Isha magazine. \"But for us it's not like wearing a Colombian poncho - it has a whole significance and political association.\" Frank says that this might explain the lag in the fashion uptake of keffiyehs. \"Maybe now that global fashion has forgotten it, we can wear it without the political significance,\" she says. \"We didn't want to miss out on the trend, but it seems some time had to pass before we could do it.\" </p> <p>Kineret, whose teenage friend reveals that she also just bought three keffiyehs, relates that she does sometimes get comments when she wears the scarf at school. \"Some people say to me, 'What, are you an Arab now?' I just tell them they don't know anything about fashion.\" In other words, and not to overstate the matter, it seems that the desire to be on trend has transcended national-political affiliation, even in the country most likely to be touchy about the subject.

Almost a million have fled their homes in eastern Congo, in the worst violence since the country's civil war that ended in 2003, which sucked in five neighbouring countries including Rwanda, Uganda and Zimbabwe.</p> <p>Like in so many other instances in Africa, the latest round of violence unfolding in eastern Congo is rather the calculated use of the ethnic card by cynical local leaders to loot the fabulous mineral wealth of the country and to shore up their own political power-bases. Meanwhile, the great powers of the west and east, as well as regional African leaders, do nothing.</p> <p>The borders of Congo, like most African countries, were drawn randomly by colonial powers. For instance, many inhabitants of Congo's North Kivu province and parts of South Kivu, the sites of the latest outbreak of violence, are Tutsis - the same as in neighbouring Rwanda. President Paul Kagame of Rwanda is cynically exploiting common ethnic backgrounds across the two countries. Tutsi rebel strongmen <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/3786883.stm\">Laurent Nkunda</a> and Jean Bosco Ntaganda are encouraged, financed and supported by Kagame.</p> <p>All three men are turning legitimate local grievances over lack of government delivery as \"ethnic\" grievances, in order to take political control of the region, and thus control over the mineral resources. The region is rich in minerals, including oil reserves. Kagame is calculating that by supporting Nkunda and Ntaganda during general instability in the mineral rich eastern Congo provinces, he could gain proxy control of the area, and so access its resources.</p> <p>Congo had \"democratic\" elections \u2013 lauded by the west and regional African governments, for nothing more than the fact they took place and that voterigging was not too \"overwhelming\". The winner, President Joseph Kabila, has not governed inclusively, in one of the world's most ethnically diverse countries \u2013 a ready recipe for fuelling ethic tensions.</p> <p>Of course it is not an easy job to hold together such a diverse nation, but the Kabila government has singularly failed to break the perception that it is only serving people from Kabila's own ethnic group. While the government is failing, a very few locals \u2013 mostly from Kabila's ethnic community \u2013 and foreign multinationals are doing well, causing widespread resentment. Congo suffers hugely from food shortages and price inflation. Failures of government are perceived as harming certain ethnic groups more than others; grievances, and hence mobilisation, along ethnic lines come easy.</p> <p>Meanwhile, a post-cold war power struggle for access to the Congo's mineral wealth is played out with Chinese and Indian-owned companies competing with western businesses. All sides are playing Kabila and none have put pressure on him to rule more inclusively.</p> <p>The west's ideological backing of Congolese dictator <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobutu_Sese_Seko\">Mobutu Sese Seko</a> (a so-called pillar of its fight against communism) rather than democratic movements, is partly the reason why the country has been in such a intractable mess. Depressingly, in the aftermath of the global financial crisis western and eastern rivalries over commodities in countries like Congo are likely to get worse.</p> <p>Right now there is also a vacuum in African continental leadership. The African Union is rudderless. The tenuous peace that ended the previous Congo conflict in 2003 held because it was underpinned by active support from the major countries in the region, led by South Africa and to a lesser extent Nigeria, under the auspices of the African Union. Now, both countries have internal leadership problems. Unless the UN sends more peacekeepers to Congo, things will get worse.</p> <p>Yet the reality is that the global financial crisis will mean the west is less likely put money into such extensive humanitarian efforts and peacekeeping operations. The UN security council has been sadly ineffective when western and eastern big-power interests are at stake.</p> <p>Kagame's supporters in the west must press him to step out of Congo; and press Kabila to talk to rebel leaders Nkunda and Ntaganda. At the end of the day, the Kabila government must serve all its citizens equitably. In diverse African societies, inclusiveness and sharing public services is the best guard against ethnic violence.</p> <p>Furthermore, western and eastern support for African countries must involve strengthening long-term democracy building, not just five-yearly elections, as has been the case in the Congo. More likely, unfortunately, is that the combination of ongoing economic and political crises will lead to more such clashes.</p>",
  "<p>Studs Terkel \u2014 master chronicler of American life in the 20th century, veteran radical and vibrant soul of the midwestern capital of Chicago \u2014 has died, aged 96. To register him as \"writer and broadcaster\" would be like calling Louis Armstrong a \"trumpeter\" or the Empire State Building an \"office block\". Strictly and sparsely speaking, it is true.</p> <p>He is best known to Americans as the voice that asked the questions on the Studs Terkel Show which ran for 45 years, syndicated from the WFMT radio station of downtown Chicago. The tapes of his interviews take up rack after rack at WFMT; there are 9,000 of them, and Studs was setting about a catalogue when he fell ill.</p> <p>The names of his guests, written in magic marker on the side of each tape, constitute the recent history not only of America but of the world: Simone de Beauvoir, Margot Fonteyn, Arthur Miller, JK Galbraith, Tennessee Williams, Andr\u00e9s Segovia, Margaret Mead, Leonard Bernstein, Jacob Bronowski and so on \u2014 including Bertrand Russell, recorded at the age of 90 during the Cuban missile crisis of 1962.</p> <p>As you listen, you know in your bones that each person has never told their story as cogently or as fully before and will never do so again, for that was Terkel's art. He was maestro of that most precious craft in the practice of both journalism and history: listening. He was the world's greatest \u2014 and loudest-mouthed \u2014 listener. He even called his 1973 autobiography Talking to Myself.</p> <p>But this distinction did much more for the archives of history than bequeath unrepeatable recordings of the great, the good and the gregarious. Terkel's obsessive interest in the propulsion of people's lives was at its most curious and passionate \u2014 and his subjects at their most brilliantly articulate \u2014 when he was dealing with everyday people, from whatever background: carpenters, judges, hub-cap fitters, priests, admirals, sharecroppers, models, signalmen, tennis players, war veterans and cooks. His book Coming of Age: the History of our Century by Those Who've Lived It (1995), was made up of interviews with elderly people. It is a vivid record of an America which, for the most part, is now distant if not passed away along with Terkel himself.</p> <p>People call Terkel's business \"oral history\", but it is more like the weaving of a fabulous verbal tapestry, the threads of which are human preoccupations. It is the rich art of taking the vernacular, and making it eternal. Such a process does not merely record the details that keep people's minds busy, it gives them value. Terkel harvested not only the most complete American history of this century, but the most compassionate.</p> <p>In a way, Terkel's story is best told through that of Hobart Foote. When one asked Terkel which of all 9,000 interviewees he valued most, the answer was this one, which made it into a book, Working (1974).</p> <p>Foote lived in a mobile home near the Illinois-Indiana state line with his wife, a Bible and little else but \"the clangor of trains, Gary-to-Chicago bound\". The area is a great mesh of railroad lines, criss-crossing the roads. And so Foote talks about the \"train problem\" he has getting to work, since his journey is punctuated by so many railway crossings and long waits for lumbering freight trains to pass, and if he arrives a minute after nine, he gets docked for the whole hour.</p> <p>And so Foote's drive to work is a daily adventure, driving at speed to a detailed but flexible system across the assault course of railway crossings, changing the route according to which train is late or on time, which crossing shut and which open. \"It's a game you're playing,\" he tells Studs. \"Catch this light at a certain time, and then you've got the next light. But if there's a train there, I take off down Cicero Avenue and watch those crossings. And if I make her okay, you've got a train just over on the Burnham line you gotta watch for. But it's generally fast ...\"</p> <p>Why does Terkel remember this especially? \"Because it's a great suspense tale. An adventure thriller through the railroads every morning, so this man doesn't get docked for the whole hour. The principle is that ordinary people have extraordinary thoughts \u2014 I've always believed that \u2014 and that ordinary people can speak poetically. Also that no one else speaks like that and that there is no other person like that in the world.\"</p> <p>Terkel used to recommend a poem to people he met, called Chicago, by Carl Sandburg: \"Hog Butcher for the world / Tool-maker, Stacker of Wheat / Player with Railroads and the Nation's Freight Handler / Stormy, husky, brawling / City of the Big Shoulders ...\"</p> <p>This was the city to which Terkel's family moved from the New York Bronx in 1920, when he was nine years old. He had been born in New York the year the Titanic sunk: \"I'm a Titanic baby,\" he used to say. His real name was Louis; \"Studs\" came later, pinched from Studs Lonigan, title of a Chicago 1930s novel by James T Farrell.</p> <p>If America consists of two great coasts, the south and a vast real-life in-between, then Chicago is the capital of that in-between. It was, and is, the capital of work, the cast-iron, steel-and-glass leveller of men; the city where dust from the \"subway\" system elevated above the streets on iron stilts showers down on the bipeds beneath regardless of status. Chicago, said Terkel, \"is the country. It is America, it is a metaphor for everything.\"</p> <p>His mother Annie opened a boarding hotel for migrant workers \u2014 roughnecks, political agitators and vagrants, by whom the young boy was captivated. \"I used to listen to their stories for hours and hours. The good and the bad, coming through my own house, and I couldn't hear enough of it.\"</p> <p>The young Studs was also entranced by the sounds of jazz and blues \u2014 \"to which people would dance on a dime\" \u2014 coming out from the the smoky, sweaty music halls. \"I used to stand by the door, on the sidewalk, and listen.\" </p> <p>Later, Studs would guide the careers of Big Bill Broonzy and other blues stars, and befriend Billie Holiday. \"She was really something,\" Studs recalled, \"with that gardenia in her hair.\" Holiday once sang Willow Weep for Me for Terkel and nine other people. \"We weren't weeping for her, we were weeping for ourselves,\" he later said, \"That's an artist.\"</p> <p>Terkel went to study law at Chicago University, graduating in 1934. \"I was miserable,\" he recalled, and conceived an ambition to join the civil service. But after an unsuccessful interview with the FBI, he failed to qualify and abandoned that aspiration. From then on, Studs said, his progress was \"an accumulation of accidents\".</p> <p>A perforated eardrum restricted his war years to \"limited service\", and he was drafted into the remarkable Works Project Administration scheme, assigned to chart the nooks, crannies, ways and means of his beloved Chicago.</p> <p>It was a blue-collar town built on steel mills, stockyards, the railroad and the construction of its own mighty self. This is how Terkel saw it: \"It is in every way a city of steel. A real city. New York is many cities at once. Chicago is one city. The blacks from the deep South didn't go to New York, they came to Chicago. And the Irish, and the East Europeans and the Koreans, to make one big steel city. It's no coincidence that the skyscraper came from Chicago. It is the architectural Athens of America.\"</p> <p>The war over, Terkel became involved in radical theatre and radio soap operas, playing bit parts \u2014 \"usually criminals or gangsters\". He also worked as a DJ, playing his favourite music: jazz, blues, folk and opera.</p> <p>With the advent of television, in 1945 Terkel was allocated his own chat show, Studs's Place, set in a Chicago diner, but it was terminated when his political views came to the attention of HUAC, the House Un-American Activities Committee, which shared the anti-communist views of Senator Joseph McCarthy. The committee's veto sent Terkel back to radio. He heard Woody Guthrie on air one day, asked what station he was listening to, and the answer was WMFT. There he went, in 1953, and there he stayed.</p> <p>While celebrities graced his programme, ordinary Americans populated his books. The first publication was Division Street America (1966), about race in Chicago. The white Appalachian hillibillies and the black Mississippi sharecroppers did not meet on the city's streets, but they did in Terkel's book, explaining their views of themselves and of each other.</p> <p>Hard Times (1970) looked back on the Depression. Here were people like Dynamite Garland from Cleveland who eventually found work in a bakery and lived off eclairs that slipped onto the floor (''roaches all over the floor, big roaches''). Although bankrupt and living with her husband and two children in a garage on $14 a week, she nevertheless blew her first $65 on a fur coat. In a similar vein was The Good War (1985), which had Americans look back at their hopes, jokes, fears and survival mechanisms during the second world war.</p> <p>But the most bountiful harvest of humanity had by then been gathered in Working. Terkel won a Pulitzer prize for these stories, like that of Hobart Foote, or Babe Secoli the supermarket checker, who described customers engaged in something less like shopping than dodgem cars with trolleys, and garbage man Nick Salerno, discoursing on his long experience of how people pack their rubbish: \"You get just like the milkman's horse \u2014 used to it.\"</p> <p>In 1981, American Dreams Lost and Found was published, including a remarkable interview with a former president of the Ku Klux Klan, CP Ellis. But shortly afterwards came something of a heresy. The Great Divide: Second Thoughts on the American Dream (1988) was Terkel ill-at-ease, in a book about rifts across society, not just between \"haves, have somewhats and have-nots\", but race and religion.</p> <p>Coming of Age, was something of a valedictory address, not only by its dramatis personae but by Terkel himself. Kurt Vonnegut called its cast of characters \"uncelebrated but undefeated, brave and just Americans whose long lifetimes are likely to expire along with a notoriously disgraceful century\".</p> <p>In its pages, the Americans of an epoch bid their successors farewell - people like Carolyn Peery of Cleveland, aged 99, who remembers her mother in law, \"born into slavery ... jumping up and down saying 'God bless Mr Lincoln. God bless Mr Lincoln!'\".</p> <p>Best of all, Terkel liked the ghost-town storekeeper in Kentucky who says: \"The last flicker of my life will be against something I don't think has to be.\"<br>Terkel commuted from near-northside Chicago to the radio station on what he called the \"Geriatric Express\" bus. He engaged his fellow passengers in conversation, aware that he was often considered \"some old nut\", feeling like \"the Ancient Mariner\" and worried that America is \"starting to suffer from a sort of collective Alzheimer's disease\".</p> <p>But when I met him, Studs's mental agility at the age of 83 was exhausting company. His face was puckish but kind, and flickered between reflection and mischief.</p> <p>He arrived at a club he liked for lunch without the obligatory tie. It was duly kitted out by the girl at reception, and knotted by Terkel around the outside of his jacket collar. He recommended a stiff Stoli Martini to kick off and \"a little wine\" to follow.</p> <p>The journey to and from his office was through a subterranean labyrinth of corridors and shopping arcades linking the WMFT building with the tower containing the luncheon club. Besides the elevator door was an Irish attendant he knew, and they burst into song. Then there was an extraordinary ritual, involving an employee at Johnny's Shoe Shine. \"Another day!\" bellowed Terkel, from quite a distance. \"Another triumph!\" boomed back the reply.</p> <p>Terkel disliked this nether region beneath the skyscrapers. \"It's supposed to tell you that you're just a little cog in a big machine,\" he objected, \"Bring back the man!\"</p> <p>His radio broadcasts finished in 1998, and the following year his wife Ida died after 60 years of happy marriage. But the books continued: two on faith, in 2001 and 2003; two on entertainment - The Spectator: Talk About Movies and Plays With Those Who Make Them (1999) and And They All Sang: Adventures of an Eclectic Disc Jockey (2005); a memoir, Touch and Go (2007); and - still to come - PS Further Thoughts From a Lifetime of Listening. His son Dan survives him.</p> <p>\u2022 Studs (Louis) Terkel, broadcaster and oral historian, born May 16 1912; died October 31 2008</p>",

  "<p>The Stanford Cricket Ground was an area of calm yesterday morning before tonight's storm. Tropical palms swayed, flags fluttered in anticipation of Antigua's November 1 Independence Day. In the middle, the yellow roadroller was trying to compact some substance into the brown strip on which cricketers of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/englandcricketteam\">England</a> and West Indies will compete for a sum of money beyond their dreams before their respective boards got into bed with an obscenely wealthy Texan self-publicist called Sir Allen Stanford. And to one side, in a powwow circle in front of their pavilion, sat the England players, listening intently as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/kevin-pietersen\">Kevin Pietersen</a> spoke at length.</p> <p>After a week of speculation, they had already been told the side that will play for a winner-takes-all purse of $1m a man and four of the circle were disappointed men, their share a possible $250,000 (\u00a3155,000) each, not unreasonable for non-participants but out of their own control. If the team loses, they too will get nothing. </p> <p>The unfortunate four (if such a deal can be considered unfortunate) are Alastair Cook, who can be here for no accountable reason other than some cockeyed team unity idea, Ravi Bopara, Ryan Sidebottom, who has an injury that would have precluded him anyway, and James Anderson. If the XI that will play appeared obvious from the way the first match against Middlesex went, then what we are seeing could be the first instance of a breakdown in spirit down strictly to money.</p> <p>All but Cook might have a genuine grievance: Bopara has played a significant part in the one-day side since the World Cup; Sidebottom is current England player of the year, having excelled in both forms; Anderson has played the last 40 one-dayers. </p> <p>Once the pitch revealed itself as one where the tallest \"bang-it-in\" bowlers could prosper more than a swing bowler, then Sidebottom and Anderson were living on borrowed time. Both, though, might rue the timing of Steve Harmison's return from self-imposed one-day exile, which if they were cynical, they might view as too convenient for comfort. If either comes straight back for the one-day series in India that follows, then their sense of grievance might be heightened even more.</p> <p>None of this, however, means Pietersen has the wrong side, and in any case the money should not be an issue in selection, despite human nature suggesting it would be. He might regret not having, say, Dimitri Mascarenhas, whose slow-medium bowling and ferocious hitting would have been ideal, but in Harmison, Andrew Flintoff and Stuart Broad he has three of the tournament's most awkward seamers, while Paul Collingwood bowled with notable skill against Trinidad &amp; Tobago.</p> <p>Instead it may be the spin pairing of Samit Patel and Graeme Swann which provides the weak link against a side that contains some explosive strikers, starting with Chris Gayle, one of the few with an international Twenty20 century. But on Thursday evening attention focused on the wicketkeeper and opening bat, Andre Fletcher, whose unbeaten 90 against Middlesex came from 66 balls, and on a withering assault from the young all-rounder Kieron Pollard. Sixes were the norm not the exception, with 14 maximums and five fours a reflection on the outfield but also the striking power of the Stanford side.</p> <p>It is Gayle himself who is the likeliest threat, however, although his lead-in has not been ideal, with rumours of a fallout with his benefactor over a personal matter that might offer a distraction. He missed Stanford's first match last Saturday for \"family reasons\" and was torpedoed on Thursday by a wicked delivery that scarcely left the ground. It is he above all that England must get rid of.</p> <p>This is not going to be the cakewalk for England that many appeared to expect. They have by no means been masters of the format they invented, having won six and lost eight of their 14 internationals. In their eight games, West Indies have won three. There is every reason to believe, however, that this side, not West Indies in the strictest sense, is a more thoughtfully appropriate squad, picked by a committee of Stanford's Legends (all of whom receive a stipend of $10,000 a month) which bypasses the usual West Indian politics.</p> <p>All indications are that sides want to bat first. Stanford has promised that problems with pitch, outfield and indeed lights will have been rectified, although it is hard to see how the first can change dramatically in such a short time. It is likely to deteriorate, take spin and get slower. The outfield meanwhile will be shaved as low as it can go, in an effort to make it faster. That might suit the England XI. </p> <p>And catching now appears to be less of an issue. On Thursday the Superstars held some stunners and missed none. The players are getting used to these lights. Let us hope that the prospect of a hapless individual spilling the millions because of glare rather than his own ineptitude has diminished. For its credibility this maligned tournament needs a genuine spectacle. Stanford might just get it. It really could be fun.</p> <h2>Tonight's teams</h2> <p><strong>Stanford Superstars</strong> (from) C Gayle (captain), A Fletcher, S Chanderpaul, R Sarwan, S Joseph, K Pollard, D Sammy, L Cush, D Powell, S Benn, J Taylor, D Mohammed, R Emrit, L James.</p> <p><strong>England </strong>K Pietersen (captain),</p> <p>I Bell, M Prior, O Shah, A Flintoff, P Collingwood, S Patel, L Wright, S Broad, G Swann, S Harmison.</p> <p><strong>Umpires</strong> S Taufel (A) &amp; R Koertzen (SA)</p> <p><strong>Sky Sports 1, 8.30pm</strong></p>",

Now it is in liquidation - leaving 7,000 employees in shock. </p> <p>\"One day we went to work as usual, the next it was all closed,\" said Wei Sunying, at the gate of the factory in Dongguan, southern China, where she spent eight years painting plastic components in a fume-filled room.</p> <p>\"Thousands of us are looking for jobs now. We walk around every day till our feet ache but we can't find anything.\"</p> <p>Few in the west have heard of Dongguan, but the chances are that your shoes, your TV or your children's toys originated here. Exports have built a city of 14 million inhabitants, almost all migrant workers from the countryside. Its economy has sustained 15% annual growth in recent years. The global economic crisis is proving the final straw for exporters punished by rising costs and stronger currency.</p> <p>In the past year, chill winds have blown through the Pearl River Delta. Sixty-seven thousand small firms collapsed in the first half of 2008, many in these manufacturing heartlands, says the national economic planning body. Toy firms have been particularly badly hit, by safety scares and product recalls. Textile firms, with wafer-thin margins, are also reeling. Next came tighter credit for many foreign-owned firms, like Hong Kong's Smart Union. And then, in the past two months, a sharp drop in US and European consumer demand. </p> <p>A local trade association predicts that by late January, Dongguan and its neighbours Shenzhen and Guangzhou will lose 9,000 of their 45,000 factories. </p> <p>\"Many factories are looking at completely empty order books,\" warned Stephen Green, head of China research at Standard Chartered, who believes the export sector may even shrink next year. Green believes China will see 7.9% growth in 2009 - well below the double digit figures of the past five years.</p> <p>That may sound enviable to western countries facing recession, but with the working age population still growing, China needs to grow by at least 8% to maintain its employment rate. The fall-out will be concentrated in provinces such as Guangdong.</p> <p>\"The social impact of this is going to be huge. The problems are getting bigger and bigger,\" said Wooyeal Paik, researching Dongguan's industry and migrant workforce at the University of California at Los Angeles.</p> <p>\"Disgruntled workers left jobless will complain more ... You will see demonstrations and picketing. And probably there's a risk of violence against bosses - especially foreigners.\"</p> <p>Dongguan's government stepped in to reimburse the Smart Union workers to the tune of 24m yuan (\u00a32.2m) after thousands gathered at the factory gates and outside local authority offices. But two month's back pay - 1,200 yuan for most - will not last long. Wei, from Guizhou, is one of many struggling to find work. \"I came here as a migrant worker because my children need money for schooling,\" she said. New job offers aren't always what they seem, added 26-year-old Fang Jianlin, whose friends were recently conned. </p> <p>\"Recruiters told them the salaries were very good, but they were asked for money. They got robbed; some were even beaten,\" he said.</p> <p>Smart Union was such a popular employer that Fang paid a hefty \"introduction fee\" to get his job there. At worst, he and his wife would earn about 600 yuan a month; at the busiest times, when production ran until 2am, they could take home 2,100 yuan each.</p> <p>It's a tragic end to the dream which lures millions of workers to Dongguan each year, where they struggle and study their way towards the promise of a regular income. At the city's night schools, thousands of workers end their days with classes on every subject from car maintenance to law. Bob Li is one of the success stories. He arrived in 1995 as a labourer; \"everyone in my hometown had heard Guangdong was covered in gold,\" he explained.</p> <p>Now he manages a factory for Richall, supplying durable bags to companies such as Walmart, Carlsberg and Disney. He is unnerved by the economic downturn. \"These days it is getting more and more difficult for factories like us,\" he said, citing the cost of wages and materials. \"The price of our materials has risen because they're made from oil ... Taken together, costs have risen by 30-40%.\"</p> <p>To some extent, Dongguan has become a victim of its own success. The rising prosperity of the region has created inflationary pressures. Workers want higher wages; new labour laws are designed to wipe out sweatshops that bring higher costs which squeeze many companies. Manufacturers have already fled inland to cheaper provinces, in many cases encouraged by Guangdong authorities, who hoped to move the province up the value chain - condensing two hundred years of western industrial development into fewer than 15. </p> <p>\"We have a policy to empty the cage for the new birds,\" Guangdong's vice-governor Wan Qingliang told reporters this month. \"The ultimate target is to build the Pearl River Delta into the core region of modern manufacturing.\" </p> <p>Others are unsure of the wisdom of the policy in the face of a worldwide downturn. \"Places like Guangdong miscalculated the development of the economy. They actually tried to push out those labour intensive and small and medium sized enterprises [SMEs] out of the [established industrial] area because they wanted hi-tech industries there. But when something bad happens, like the economic downturn, what are they going to do?\" said Paik. He acknowledges that numerous east Asian economies have moved up the value chain in the same way, and that the Chinese government deserves to be confident given its economic record. \"But they haven't experienced a serious economic downturn except right after 1989 and have been overconfident in their policy of the quick transformation of industrial structure toward hi-tech in Guangdong,\" he cautioned. The risk is that officials might push the city off the economic ladder rather than up it. Whether subsidies, tax rebates and other support for small firms can save them remains to be seen.</p> <p>Yet China's rising living standards in the 30 years since economic reforms were launched has left most people optimistic about its long-term prospects. Migrant workers returning home think they may come back in a few years.</p> <p>\"If we compare the situation to when I first arrived, I have already found my pot of gold,\" said Bob Li. \"But I can still see it's just the beginning.\"</p>",
  "<p>We have no control over the mists, but mellow fruitfulness is a quality that all gardeners can bring to their patch. To watch blackbirds squabbling over the fattest red berries on the guelder rose or to pick glossy crab apples to accompany the last blackberries is to round off the season. Berries and fruit engender the feeling of the gardening cycle turning full circle. At a time when flowers are few and far between, they bring bounty to a fast fading scene.</p> <p>Some of the best are natives. The guelder rose, Viburnum opulus, is a familiar sight in the countryside, where its straight, strong stems bear bunches of glossy, postbox-red berries complemented by polychromatic leaves. In May, when those same leaves were emerging fresh and green, there were great lace-cap heads of creamy white flowers. Viburnum opulus is undemanding and a worthy constituent of a native hedge, which makes an effective and nature-friendly boundary. If you have a yen for the unusual, try V. opulus 'Xanthocarpum' with its golden berries. </p> <p>Both can be increased now by taking hardwood cuttings. Sever strong pieces of stem about 20cm long from this year's growth, cutting directly under a bud for the bottom cut and above a bud for the top, using a sloping cut to carry away rainwater. Remove any leaves that are still hanging on. In a sheltered corner, make a trench with a flat back, line its base with grit or sand to aid drainage, and insert the cuttings vertically. Fill in and firm so that a couple of buds are proud of the ground. Many shrubs can be increased in this way.</p> <p>Another easy way to make more is by sowing the berries, and this is especially useful for species trees that cannot be increased from cuttings. Sorbus, especially the mountain ash clan, are among the most attractive of berrying trees, their berries ranging through white, pink, amber-yellow and orange to vivid red. Most have gloriously coloured foliage to boot, and when the leaves fall to the ground, the berries will persist. Once S. vilmorinii has shed its red mantle, the crimson berries decorate its branches deep into winter, changing gradually through pink to white.</p>",
  "<p>Books are not stable substances: their tone, flavour and entire angle of attack can be altered by the passage of time. The Right Stuff by Tom Wolfe is only 30 years old - a mere baby in the hallowed world of classic literature. But it has dated faster than anyone could have expected, and certainly no longer feels like the bright comet that appeared in a shower of sparks in 1979. At the time, Wolfe seemed in love with his jet-propelled subject, but now we can see that nothing ages faster than the new thing. The world tilts differently now, and its shifting axis has cast shadows over Wolfe's still-dazzling sentences. As recent pictures of India and China's space missions showed, the time when America's lunar landings spoke of a nation inspired by progress and adventure - reaching for the stars - may be over. </p> <p>The novel tells the story of America's shaky first steps into space, and as soon as Wolfe embarked on the conversations that would fuel his verbal aerobatics, he saw that he had strolled into an unexplored area. Hardly anyone had written with gusto about fighter pilots, so Wolfe found himself alone, he wrote later, in a \"rich and fabulous terrain\" which up till then was \"as dark as the far side of the moon\". There was, he suggested, an alluring explanation for this. The horrors of the first world war had inspired an austere orthodoxy to the effect that war was hell, and that the only virtuous way to depict it was to present the mortal trials of some dumb bloody footslogger (officers all being callous buffoons). \"The old-fashioned tale of prowess and heroism was relegated to second- and third-rate forms,\" wrote Wolfe. And hardly anyone cared about the lethal mid-air novelty of high-performance flight. </p> <p>This was a perfect subject for Wolfe. He was already famous for slapping vivid rhetoric around subjects previously thought too frivolous for literature: stock car racing, scandal magazines, race riots, party girls, art critics, student rebels, sex evangelists and so on. Demotic America, he noticed, now had the wealth to create its own institutions. He called this \"the incredible postwar American electro-pastel surge into the suburbs\", and he became its first and most articulate chronicler.</p> <p>The Right Stuff flowed straight from these preoccupations. It presented the psychodrama behind America's first blasts into space by introducing us to the seven top-of-the-range pilots selected (in a top-secret series of X-Factor-like auditions) to form the first cadre of astronauts. It described the sapping impositions that fell on their wives, and lampooned the media fabrications that drilled their heroics into the public mind. Most of all, it captured flying-ace culture. These unknown men, it said, are modern heroes; while music and sports stars rule the roost, these forgotten military guys, climbing into their primitive, unreliable rockets and soaring up to the stars, are the truly righteous single-combat warriors of the modern era. </p> <p>The book hummed with great set pieces: aghast wives leaned on to provide \"solid backing on the home front\", looking at the plume of smoke over the airbase and wondering which of their husbands had \"bought the farm\"; the unflustered, supercool voice of the cockpit, laconic even as he corkscrewed through the sound barrier in a flaming tailspin; the dumb reflexes of the news beast, the \"Victorian gent\", with its tweedy insistence that the pilots be \"served up inside the biggest slice of Mom's pie you could imagine\"; the huckster politics and cold-war fearmongering. The book was a ticker-tape parade of giddy episodes.</p> <p>Much of it was sarcastic, because Wolfe found himself with not just a great subject, but a marvellous story, too. It turned out that the astronauts, hand-picked, buffed up and offered to the world as the bravest pilots in America, were not really pilots at all, but military test subjects. They didn't control their space flights; they endured them. The real aces, who were still breaking speed records on unknown airbases under the inspiring wing of their leader, Chuck Yeager, would snigger into their beers when they heard that the first spaceman was to be a chimpanzee. \"A monkey's gonna make the first flight,\" they would laugh. It was clear to them that the chosen ones were mere passengers in this silly enterprise - \"Perhaps the ape would go to the White House and get a medal.\"</p> <p>But the world was not disposed, or permitted, to laugh. Nothing would be allowed to spoil the patriotic melodrama surrounding the astronauts. If anything, people said: \"My God, do you mean there are men brave enough to try what that ape has just gone through?\" Scenes like this gave the book a suave, satirical edge. The best and bravest did not even fly their rockets, but ... so what? No one seemed to care. </p> <p>Yet even as he mocked the glib sentimentality of American life, Wolfe hoisted his pilots on to a plinth. They faced awful odds (one in four career fliers got killed) every time they strapped themselves into a rocket, and they possessed a rare quality of nonchalant bravery. This was the right stuff, and you either had it or you didn't. \"It was not bravery in the simple sense of being willing to risk your life,\" wrote Wolfe. \"Any fool could do that. No, the idea seemed to be that a man should have the ability to go up in a hurtling piece of machinery and put his hide on the line and then have the moxie, the reflexes, the experience, the coolness, to pull it back in the last yawning moment - and then go up again the next day ...\" Whatever it was, this righteous stuff was the essence of American manliness, as precious as gold dust. </p> <p>The book launch went smoothly - better than the clumsy misfires in the story itself. The New York Times said that it was \"accurate, learned, cheeky, risky, touching, tough, compassionate, nostalgic, worshipful, jingoistic . . . superb\". So I wondered, when I threw a copy into my luggage earlier this year, whether it could survive a visit to modern Florida. </p> <p>We went, en famille, to the Kennedy Space Center, the swampy bulge of nether land on the Atlantic coast formerly known as Cape Canaveral. We traced the footsteps of the pioneers who had wedged themselves into these turrets of high explosive. The rockets had epic names - Redstone, Mercury, Atlas. When we peered into the tiny lunar capsule we recalled that scene in The Right Stuff where Al Shepard, the first American in space, had to relieve himself in his pants during his historic but delayed countdown (the boffins had forgotten to devise relief for a bursting astronaut). </p> <p>For the most part, however, the Space Center brought home how sharply things have changed. In Wolfe's book, Florida is like the wild west - \"a poor godforsaken afterthought in the march of terrestrial evolution\" - which turns out to be an ideal military testing ground, and perfect for fighter jocks. It is miles from anywhere: \"a paradise of Flying and Drinking and Drinking and Driving\". It is not rocket science to point out that those days are long gone. Today's Florida is condominiums, swimming pools and golf courses as far as the eye can see. The training arena for America's most radiant gladiators has become a world leader in developer-sleaze and environmental corruption.</p> <p>On the coach trip round the launch-sites, our guide seemed world-weary. He didn't even glance at the rocket pads; his patter was synchronised with the view. But he was scornful of inattention. \"For those of you who've just been to Disneyland,\" he said, \"it's Tuesday.\" He glared down the bus. The tone was unmistakable: pure weapons-grade Nasa-sponsored pique. The man was bitter that this fabled wilderness, where men once fired themselves up to the heavens, was now just the second, perhaps third, biggest theme park in Florida. \"We still could go to the moon,\" he kept saying. \"But the government won't give us the money. Fuel's too expensive or some damned thing.\" </p> <p>The Right Stuff may be comic, but in the end it applauds an inspiring mission. Those first orbits, from the incendiary lift-offs to the calm ocean splashdowns, were a miracle of engineering expertise and can-do zeal, the work of a nation that aspired to great things and was eager to show the world its devotion to new frontiers. Where is that country now, that was once the hope of the free world? Squatting in Iraq, hunched against enemies it cannot see, reviled and resented for its cultural and financial heavy-handedness. It is not easy, now, to swallow such an innocent vision of American prowess. Interestingly, Wolfe's other notorious subject - the Wall Street excess pilloried in The Bonfire of the Vanities - has also been wrenched out of shape. If Wolfe were to revisit the bonfire now, it would not be to hoot at its silly extravagance, but to poke around in the ashes. One of the high points of The Right Stuff comes when one of the astronauts, Gordo Cooper, awaits lift-off. As the scientists run their final checks, they are bemused by the slowing of his vital signs. While the fuel - 200,000 pounds of liquid oxygen - begins to glow white, and the world holds its breath, the pilot simply dozes off. \"Throughout America,\" wrote Wolfe, \"untold millions of people were wondering, My God, what goes through a man's mind at a time like this! Scarcely able to believe it themselves, Nasa never supplied the answer.\" </p> <p>This remains an entertaining scene, but now it is shot through with wistfulness, like a tattered flag. American politics and culture have changed since the naive time when astronauts, through their press spokesman Loudon Wainwright, could appear in Life magazine as 100% God-fearing Huck Finn patriots. These days, if an astronaut gets drunk, it makes the papers, and the only boom area is in infantile conspiracy theories: did they really walk on the moon? It would not be possible, now, for a rocket man to bust a rib falling from a horse and still have a crack at the sound barrier the next day - as Yeager (later General Yeager) does, in the third chapter of the book. </p> <p>The result is that The Right Stuff is now best read as an elegy - a remembrance of vanished times. It describes a place and a mood that have crashed and burned. The seeds of this melancholy may already have been in place when the book was published - Wolfe was describing the early 60s from the vantage point of the late 70s, after all. But he was still able to work in an optimistic, fizzing spirit that has now quite dissolved: no one writes pop songs about astronauts the way that Bowie/Elton John/Pink Floyd and company once did. A book that once juddered with thoughts of the future now comes suffused with the past. Nostalgia for the 60s usually involves thoughts of free love, raw music and ditzy drugs, not the panic attacks inspired by Sputnik and the missile testing in Arizona and Florida. Wolfe was thrilled to find such subjects, and had superb, pyrotechnic fun with them. Who would have thought, only a generation later, that his eager, loop-the-loop prose would seem so sad?</p>",
  "<p>Gibbon has cast a long shadow over Byzantium. The great 18th-century historian, the first to study the eastern empire seriously, wrote it off as a dispiriting tale of moral and cultural decay. \"They held in their lifeless hands,\" he wrote, \"the riches of their fathers without inheriting the spirit which had created and improved that sacred patrimony ... their languid souls seemed incapable of thought and action. In the revolution of 10 centuries, not a single discovery was made to exalt the dignity or promote the happiness of mankind. Not a single idea was added to the speculative systems of antiquity, and a succession of patient disciples became in their turn the dogmatic teachers of the next servile generation.\" </p> <p>Constantly repeated, Gibbon's prejudices have become received truths. The very word \"Byzantine\" has passed into the language as a synonym for all that is obscure, tortuous or conspiratorial. He was not alone. \"A worthless repertory of declamations and miracles,\" wrote Voltaire; \"... a disgrace to the human mind.\" Modern generations have found similar reasons for their instinctive suspicion of the Byzantine world. It may be true, as Cyril Mango observes in his introduction to the catalogue of the Royal Academy's new exhibition, Byzantium 330-1453, that \"what used to be called superstition is now called spirituality\". But we are still wary of theocratic states, enclosed value systems and patterns of daily life controlled by intense and manipulative religious emotion. So the study of Byzantium remains an arcane pleasure reserved for archaeologists, aesthetes and enthusiasts.</p> <p>This is a pity, for medieval Byzantium made an incomparable contribution to European civilisation. For centuries it defended Europe against successive waves of Asiatic invaders. For more than a millennium, it was the sole political embodiment of Hellenic culture. Its scholars, compilers and scribes were responsible for preserving much of the literary and scientific legacy of ancient Greece. Without them, we would know almost nothing of Plato, Euclid, Sophocles or Thucydides, apart from isolated fragments written on papyrus. Yet Byzantium was a great deal more than a conduit from the ancient world to the European Renaissance. It was a cosmopolitan society, standing at the crossroads of Europe, Asia and Africa. At the height of its prosperity, Constantinople was the richest and most populous city of the medieval world. Its aristocracy and civil service laid out their riches in books, ivories, jewellery and metalwork. The Greek church, with its dramatic liturgy, its rich symbolism and its powerful mystical tradition inspired buildings, paintings and sculpture of great beauty and originality. Byzantium created a unique fusion of classical, Christian and Asiatic traditions, which deserves more than the sneers of the age of Enlightenment.</p> <p>This is the first British exhibition to be devoted to the whole course of Byzantine civilisation since the famous show organised for the Edinburgh festival and the V&amp;A by David and Tamara Talbot Rice, now half a century ago. That drew mainly on the leading English museums. The Royal Academy and the Benaki Museum in Athens, which have together organised this event, have been able to range more widely. Many of the treasures of the British Museum, the British Library and the V&amp;A are here. But there are also beautiful pieces from France, Germany, Italy, Greece, Russia and Ukraine, from the major American collections of New York, Cleveland and Dumbarton Oaks and, perhaps most remarkably, an entire room of icons from the monastery of St Catherine at Sinai, which are difficult to get to in their usual home and rarely exhibited elsewhere.</p> <p>Byzantine civilisation was essentially the civilisation of Constantinople. Founded in AD330 as a new capital for Rome's Mediterranean empire, it was intended as an escape from the corruption, insecurity and paganism of Rome. Throughout its history, Constantinople was an intensely political city. Its artistic output was dominated by what one might loosely call \"official\" art. It was designed to impress, to convey the power of the emperors and the authority of the Orthodox church, two institutions that were intimately linked for most of the empire's history. The gold coins shown in this exhibition, with Christ on one side and the emperor on the other, say it all. Equally evocative, the magnificently carved ivory archangel of the sixth century from the British Museum was once part of a diptych, the other half of which would have shown the emperor receiving from the archangel the orb and sceptre of his office. This piece, a striking marriage of imperial propaganda, Christian imagery and pure classical style, probably belonged to the sixth-century emperor Justinian. It is one of many exceptionally beautiful ivories in this exhibition.</p> <p>The quintessential Byzantine artefacts, however, are icons. These images, invested by their votaries with powerful miraculous properties, were central to the life of the Byzantine empire. They also exemplified an attitude to figurative art that has no parallel in the western tradition. To the Greeks of Byzantium, the material world was a mere shadow of an invisible and immaterial world beyond. An icon was not just a representation of the physical world. It was a living thing, a re-enactment, or mimesis, of the subject, like the reflections of human figures cast on the walls of Plato's caves. It was a direct means of communication between the worshipper and God. Icons are richly represented in this exhibition. One of the earliest pieces, a sixth-century icon of the Virgin and Child from Kiev, may originally have been presented by the emperor Justinian to the monastery at Sinai. The ivory relief of Christ Pantocrator (\"All-powerful\") from the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge stares out at the beholder to demand his veneration. The latest examples, dating from the 13th and 14th centuries, bring a measure of humanity to the once distant and severe figure of Christ, at just the time that Italian artists were learning to do likewise. Byzantine painting is often criticised as immobile, formulaic or insular. These extraordinary panels tell a different story.</p> <p>Mosaics, which are among the most spectacular surviving artefacts of the Byzantine world, served a very similar spiritual function. They also enabled their creators to indulge their love of rich materials and their fascination with light, reflected in intense, contrasting colours. An account left by a Russian ambassador visiting Haghia Sophia in the 10th century conveys something of the impact of these great decorative schemes, dimly and indirectly lit in their grand architectural settings. This man was convinced that the angels came down from the mosaics to participate in the service: \"Are we in heaven or on earth?\" For obvious reasons, mosaic is hard to show in an exhibition such as this. But there are superb portable panels from the late middle ages in micromosaic, made with tesserae so small that one needs to come very close to see that they are not paintings.</p> <p>The same sense of direct contact with God through images and objects inspired the creation of smaller and more personal pieces, such as the rich reliquary crosses in gold and silver, studded with gems and enclosing fragments of hair or bone, which were carried next to the chest to ward off evil. At the opposite extreme, the same technical skills could be applied to subjects secular, scatological, even scandalous. The Veroli casket, made in Constantinople in the 10th century and bought from the canons of Veroli cathedral by a passing English tourist in 1861, was presumably made for a well-heeled courtier. Its humorous, erotic images, loosely based on classical myths, reveal the same love of gorgeous materials and profuse, intricate decoration, even if the subject could hardly be further from the intensely spiritual seriousness of the icons and mosaics.</p> <p>The 10th and 11th centuries were a period of unparalleled prosperity. Constantinople was the world's chief entrepot for spices, silks, metals and slaves. Greek merchants and shipowners dominated the trade routes of the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. Its currency was the international medium of exchange across Europe and Asia. The city was recognised even in the Latin west as one of the great spiritual and artistic treasure-houses of Christendom. When, in 1177, Amaury, the Latin king of Jerusalem, paid a state visit to the city, one of his entourage recorded the occasion. The king and his party were astonished by the marble staircases, triumphal arches and columns adorned with statues and trophies, the hippodrome, the court ceremonies, the ethereal choirs in the emperor's antechambers, the profusion of gorgeous objects in the imperial palaces and chapels: ivory, precious fabrics, gold, silver and marble, \"all the priceless treasures which had been gathered there by his imperial ancestors ... reverendly preserved from the times of the good emperors Constantine, Theodosius and Justinian\".</p> <p>Dazzled by the wealth and brilliance of Constantinople, Amaury had no conception of the empire's inner weakness. A century before, in 1071, the imperial armies had been wiped out by the Seljuk Turks at the battle of Manzikert. At a stroke, Byzantium had lost all the provinces of Asia Minor from which it had once drawn the bulk of its grain, tax revenues and soldiers. It was a blow from which there would be no recovery. Another was to follow, shortly after Amaury's visit. In 1204, Constantinople was captured and sacked by the armies of the Fourth Crusade. A Latin dynasty was installed in the city, which held sway over little more than the territory within the walls. Most of the Balkan and Aegean possessions of the empire were occupied by the Serbs and the Bulgars, and assorted French, Italian and Catalan adventurers, until they too finally were swept aside by the Turks. A large part of the city's treasures, books, paintings and works of art was either destroyed or dispersed. Its craftsmen, starved of commissions, migrated elsewhere.</p> <p>The sack of Constantinople was a tragedy for the city, but it accounts for the survival in western museums of a large number of Byzantine artefacts, including many of those exhibited at the RA. The finest items went to Venice, whose leaders had played a prominent part in the Fourth Crusade and knew better than others what was worth taking. The show contains several items from the treasury of St Mark's and the Marcian Library, all of which were pillaged from the ruins of the Byzantine capital in 1204. The extraordinary gold and silver cloisonn\u00e9 icon of the archangel Michael and the so-called Chalice of the Patriarchs were probably found in one of the imperial chapels. The bishop of Troyes in France, who obviously had more secular tastes, carried off a coffer carved with scenes of war and hunting, which is still among the possessions of his cathedral.</p> <p>By the time the Greek emperors recovered possession of their capital in 1261, much of it had been wrecked. Visitors who described it in the next two centuries painted a bleak picture of dilapidated buildings, abandoned houses, pillaged monuments and a much reduced population, most of it living in abject poverty. It was a period of disastrous civil wars and rapid economic decline. Yet even now Byzantine artists were capable of fresh inspiration. There was a resurgence of literary scholarship, astronomy and medicine, which has been called the \"last Byzantine Renaissance\". The 14th and 15th centuries witnessed an astonishing renewal of older traditions of painting and mosaic-work. The famous mosaics of Chora, the intricate micromosaics, the icons of the last great generation of Byzantine painters, were all created in this period against a common background of impoverishment and failure.</p> <p>On May 29 1453, after a hopeless defence of its thousand-year-old walls that had lasted seven weeks, Constantinople fell to the troops of the Turkish sultan Mehmet II. The last emperor died in the assault. His empire vanished from sight, leaving few traces of its existence. The scholars and artists fled to Mistra or Italy. The leisured and learned mandarinate that occupied the upper reaches of the imperial civil service, and had provided the clientele for generations of Greek scholars and artists, ceased to exist. The Orthodox church survived in increasingly difficult circumstances, but all the greater churches of Constantinople were turned into mosques. Their elaborate painted and mosaic decorations were destroyed or covered up with whitewash or plaster, to be rediscovered in some cases by the archaeologists of the 20th century. Apart from a few fragments, none of the secular buildings of the empire has survived. The heartlands of the empire are now Turkish. Since the terrible forced migrations of the 1920s, there has not even been a significant Greek minority in Constantinople or in the coastal settlements of Asia Minor where Greeks had lived since classical times. </p> <p>But there is another, more fundamental sense in which Byzantium has left no trace. The mentality of its artists, and of those who enjoyed or venerated their work, is hard for the secular west to recapture. A painting by Titian or Rembrandt speaks for itself to anyone with a minimal knowledge of 16th-century Italy or 17th-century Holland and a basic grasp of Christianity. The artefacts in this exhibition, beautiful as many of them are, require a more sustained effort of historical imagination. At the time of their creation, they were part of a total aesthetic experience. We have to place ourselves in a world that loved drama and splendour, and regarded neither as gaudy or superficial; a world that looked up to the stiff orientalising court of a half-divine emperor, with its elaborate ceremonial and its finely graded hierarchies of officials and servants; a world of constant processions of dignitaries wearing gorgeous robes, jewellery and gaudy cosmetics, each according to his status; of churches dimmed by incense pouring from metal braziers; of imperial chapels populated by crowds of officials, priests, eunuchs and soldiers, the air filled with hymns and chants such as those which had struck King Amaury so powerfully. Many of the objects exhibited at the RA look slightly incongruous in their glass cases. The icons and liturgical objects were made to be carried, to be touched and kissed. The rich materials of which they were made were intended to be stroked. The subtle patterns in the fabrics could be seen only when they moved. Mosaics were designed for the dim glow of lamps and candles, not the harsh direct light favoured by modern museum practice.</p> <p>Observation, as Yeats knew, is not enough:<br>Once out of nature I shall never take<br>My bodily form from any natural thing,<br>But such a form as Grecian goldsmiths make<br>Of hammered gold and gold enamelling<br>To keep a drowsy Emperor awake;<br>Or set upon a golden bough to sing<br>To lords and ladies of Byzantium<br>Of what is past, or passing, or to come.</p> <p>\u2022 Byzantium 330-1453 is at the Royal Academy of Arts, London W1, until March 22.

  "<p>In Saul Bellow's novel Herzog the tormented intellectual protagonist addresses one of his many letters to Adlai Stevenson, the unsuccessful Democratic candidate for president in 1952 and 1960. \"Dear Governor Stevenson,\" Herzog begins, \"I supported you in 1952. Like many others I thought this country might be ready for its great age in the world and intelligence at last assert itself in public affairs.\"</p> <p>Bellow, who briefly considered writing a biography of Stevenson, is expressing the faith that so many writers in postwar America invested in - yes, another cerebral politician from Illinois. John Kenneth Galbraith and Arthur Schlesinger Jr were among the \"eggheads\" who hoped that Stevenson would inaugurate a new era in America, or at least check the forces of philistinism and conformity unleashed by McCarthy-style anti-communism and what President Eisenhower himself called the \"military-industrial complex\".</p> <p>But Stevenson's witty phrases - New Dealers, he warned, might be replaced by car dealers in Ike's America - and obvious erudition did not persuade the great American public. He lost both elections by a landslide to the affable general, who won, as Herzog put it, \"because he expressed low-grade universal potato love\".</p> <p>Appalled by eight years of cultural and political sterility, during which car-dealing Rabbits proliferated in suburbia, many American writers and intellectuals fixed on John F Kennedy as their saviour. The Harvard-educated president, who authored a Pulitzer-winning book, eagerly reciprocated their attention, seeking out the company of Norman Mailer and Tennessee Williams, though he preferred to read Ian Fleming. Attending a White House dinner, Robert Lowell noted that only Edmund Wilson among the writers present wasn't \"addled with adulation\". Asked by the president about his book Patriotic Gore (whose preface derides the US government's perennially high \"moral justification for war\"), Wilson told Kennedy to read it for himself.</p> <p>Nearly half a century later another young candidate for president has charmed many writers out of political despair and indifference. Philip Roth, Michael Chabon, Jonathan Raban, Jhumpa Lahiri, John Updike ... the endorsements, both explicit and not, for Barack Obama keep rolling in, and it is easy to understand why. Emerging in the wake of an intellectually and morally numb administration, Obama not only seems a providential intervention in American politics. He is also a writer of great skill and emotional power, as his memoir Dreams from My Father makes clear. </p> <p>\"You would be surprised,\" the young JFK was informed by his ambitious father, \"how a book that really makes the grade with high-class people stands you in good stead for years to come.\" But nothing in Dreams from My Father hints at such up-market self-promotion, or indeed at the ghost-writer who actually authored JFK's Pulitzer-winning book Profiles of Courage. Rather, its taut, sharp sentences reveal a remarkable capacity for self-examination and a finely developed negative capability; and its frank confessions of doubt and ambiguity make it possible to see Obama's paeans to American exceptionalism as election-time expediency. </p> <p>Shorn of his political rhetoric, Obama appears to be a writer possessed of the sense - which Sarah Palin might call \"un-American\" - of the tragic limit and unpredictability of human action. And for writers who dream of wielding a transformative power with their work, watching one of their kind ascend to the West Wing is undoubtedly thrilling. It seems that, as Herzog hoped, intelligence finally has a chance of asserting itself in public affairs. But the odds against its success are still enormous.</p> <p>JFK's own career cautions against excessive faith in brainy politicians offering change from the extremely isolated office of the American presidency. Early death at the hands of an enigmatically lone assassin has shrouded his reputation in a \"what could have been\" mist. But Kennedy never broke free of the many stultifying compulsions of postwar America's affluence and power, including the obligation to look and act tough. In fact, he struck more pugnacious postures than even his Texan successor, whose assault on Vietnam quickly deprived the Democratic party of its literary-intellectual fan base. In the presidential election in 1960, Kennedy attacked his opponent Nixon from the right. As president he almost sparked armageddon with his grandstanding during the Cuban missile crisis, and irreversibly militarised American involvement in Vietnam. (In the process, he expedited the political education of at least one of his literary admirers, Gore Vidal: a brutal disabusing that today feels a blessing to readers of Vidal's clear-sighted essays.)</p> <p>Obama, too, will be the president of a deeply conservative country, which was persuaded to choose a black intellectual over a war hero and hockey mom only by the fear of economic collapse, and which the overall decline in national fortunes is likely to push to the rancorous right after next week's lurch to the moderate centre. Indeed, Obama's own tough talk about taking the supposedly \"good\" war in Afghanistan to Pakistan - part of a JFK-style rhetorical offensive from the right - is likely to trap him into a disastrous course of action. Not surprisingly, last month's fundraiser for Obama attended by Salman Rushdie, Jhumpa Lahiri, Kiran Desai and other writers of Indian origin did not attract any writers from Pakistan, one of the countries laid waste by the \"war on terror\", whose many false assumptions Obama seems unable to abandon even as he points to its failed strategies. </p> <p>Like Adlai Stevenson and JFK, Obama appeals subliminally to a powerless intelligentsia at least partly because he appears, with his superior intelligence, wit and learning, to hold himself aloof from the dingy realm of politics. But he'll soon no longer be able to afford much writerly idealism. </p> <p>\"By definition,\" Camus wrote, a writer \"cannot serve today those who make history .. . he must serve those who are subject to it.\" Certainly, moral imagination of the kind Obama seems to possess - one solicitous of the victims of history - has no deadlier foe than the mammoth apparatus of centralised power he will soon preside over. Those who avidly await Obama's political apotheosis next week must now also brace themselves for the melancholy spectacle of a promising writer's swift decline.</p>",
  "<p>Well, supposedly, Gordon Brown; but then who runs him? The most telling detail in this book about what's happened to the Labour party is a personal one. Robert Peston is the son of the life peer Lord Peston of Mile End, ennobled by Neil Kinnock. According to Peston Junior, a Labour functionary called to check that Peston had not made any substantial donation to Labour's coffers. Had he done so, there would have been no stoat coat for Peston Senior. But these days, and despite the notional illegality of the practice, it wouldn't appear that shovelling loads of money into the party bank account is too much of an obstacle to finding a parking space in the House of Lords. </p> <p>So while I recommend this book, I do so with my fingers pinching my nose shut. The stink of money-worship rises from its pages. Here is an extract from an interview with Sir Philip Green in 2004: \"I said to my wife last Sunday morning - about a quarter to six I woke up - I said to Tina how lucky we have been to somehow get through this jungle to end up with a private business turning over \u00a33bn, virtually no debt, nobody to answer to.\" Never mind the nauseating business of being the kind of monster who boasts of waking up at a quarter to six on a Sunday - think about Tina, who by extreme good fortune is a citizen of Monaco, and therefore does not contribute to this country's exchequer. And how much of Sir Philip's earnings actually go through her bank account? You'll find out here.</p> <p>The book's title is actually a bit of a misnomer. The revolting plutocrats you find here don't really run Britain - they just sponge off it, bleed it dry and consider that as long as they're hardly paying any tax at all, and are left alone with \"nobody to answer to\", that's fine. Peston raises the spectre of their children deciding that it would be fun to enter politics and establish a proper plutocracy, but as a plutocracy is what, in effect, we already have (remember, we are dealing with a culture celebrated in magazines with titles such as Alpha), one wonders why they would bother. </p> <p>The subtitle of this book is ... And Who's to Blame for the Mess We're In. Its original subtitle, when it came out in hardback in February, was How Britain's New Elite Are Changing Our Lives. Neither is fully accurate, but the later subtitle, although it looks somewhat opportunistic, is better, in that Peston really does name the guilty men. And if you're going to understand what it is they do, and how Blair and Brown roll over for them, then I am afraid you are going to have to read this.</p> <p>But do not expect some kind of Pilgerian flaming sword of justice. Peston's dad may have been an Old Labour supporter who believed in the benevolence of the state and the inevitable rise of the equitable society, but little Robert, at some point nel mezzo del cammin di sua vita, decided that Margaret Thatcher's reforms were necessary, and so is rather beholden to the people whose careers he appraises and describes. At various points in the book he says that the striving for efficiency - that is, paying your cleaners less, paying your bills later and so on - is not necessarily a bad thing. And yet he does not, at least, condone their tax-avoidance, or indeed Labour's naive faith in the market. (Incidentally, do not expect any up-to-date stuff on \"the economic mess we're in\": here only Northern Rock has taken a battering. Merrill Lynch, HBOS and Lehman are all doing fine, and nor does he see any ill fortune for them in his crystal ball.) </p> <p>But then if he didn't have sympathy for the financial world, he wouldn't have got the access or the insight he has. He is a very able explicator of how financial markets work. This is the kind of stuff that makes my eyes glaze over, but he manages, remarkably, to maintain the reader's attention. (Although one wearies, at times, of the parade of \"hardly run-of-the-mill\" wheeler-dealers; they're virtually all East End boys with colourful language and homespun philosophies.) It pains me to say it, but the fact that he's on their side means his criticisms might well carry more weight. </p> <p>\u2022 To order Who Runs Britain? for \u00a37.99 with free UK p&amp;p call Guardian book service on 0870 836 0875.</p>",
  "<p>Tatiana Boncompagni Hoover is a socialite. Possibly related to an Italian princess, and certainly married to a vacuum cleaner heir, she is also a published author who writes a column for a glossy magazine and is friends with other socialites such as Tinsley Mortimer and Fabiola Beracasa.</p> <p>Natasha Boncompagni is a socialite too. She had a job on Wall Street, wants to write books and has socialite friends. Her sister Tatiana, however, is not one of them.</p> <p>In a plot plucked from the pulpier end of high society, the two are locked in a court battle over the authorship of the enticingly titled Hedge Fund Wives, due to be published by HarperCollins.</p> <p>Tatiana is suing her 33-year-old sister, claiming that she hacked into her personal computer and stole portions of the manuscript for her forthcoming novel. Natasha then filed the extracts with the US Copyright Office, claiming that she was the co-author of the forthcoming novel, and posted the extracts on two websites.</p> <p>Natasha, however, insisted in an email to reporters: \"From the very beginning, Tatiana and I were a 'writing team'. </p> <p>\"I had hoped to avoid a public revelation of my sister's well-known - and frequent - manipulations of the truth. Having said that, with my sister's filing ... this matter has evolved out of my control and into a public spectacle. The media's attention that my parents and I have now have had to endure has been endless.\"</p> <p>Hedge Fund Wives is set in the glamorous world of financial services. Natasha claims that the novel draws on her \"decade-long\" Wall Street career and \"insider's knowledge of the social workings of the hedge fund community\".</p> <p>It is racy stuff, with the protagonists agonising about their portfolios and Jimmy Choos as they gaze down from the umpteenth floor of their corporate eyrie. The judge was not won over by Natasha's rebuttal, ordering a temporary restraining order against her this week, and instructing her to cease claiming co-authorship and to take down online extracts.</p> <p>Natasha responded to the order in acidic style: \"Given my sister's motto, 'No publicity is bad publicity', I wouldn't be surprised if she isn't pleased with all the attention,\" she told a New York gossip column.</p> <p>But Natasha wasn't finished. In further statements she alleged that she had turned down $5,000 from her sister's agent to buy her off, and had been planning her own lawsuit. Her sister, she alleged, wasn't related to Italian royalty or descended from the 16th-century pope Gregory XIII, as she had claimed in publicity for her first novel, Gilding Lily, which came out earlier this year.</p> <p>And as for Maximilian, the Hoover heir? Tatiana, Natasha wrote in another email to journalists, \"continues to fabricate that her husband is a 'vacuum cleaning scion' when in reality, that is categorically false: the remaining ownership interest that her husband's family had in Hoover was sold decades ago and her husband will not be inheriting whatever paltry sum is remaining as his father has squandered that.\"</p> <p>Tatiana's lawyer's response was just as acerbic. \"Our client's pleasure with the court's order,\" wrote Alan Fisch, \"is tempered by the disappointment that litigation was necessary.\" The case continues.</p> <h2>Extract</h2> <p>In one extract of the novel Hedge Fund Wives, on Natasha Boncompagni's website, the protagonist, Marcy, arrives for a meeting </p> <p>\"The room I was in had sweeping views over midtown and two Warhol silk screens of dollar signs on the interior walls. I took a seat at the circular black glass conference table and spent five minutes pushing down my cuticles with my thumbnail before Thorne appeared in the doorway.</p> <p>And when he did, he was talking on his iPhone, an inexcusable offense as far as I was concerned.</p> <p>'No, there's no way I'm signing up for one more charity,' Thorne was hissing into his phone ... \"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Sunday November 2 2008.

  "<p>The world's largest women-only university is being built in Saudi Arabia; with a campus that will cover 8m square metres and accommodate 40,000 students.</p> <p>Due to open in 2010, the Princess Noura bint Abdulrahman University, on the outskirts of Riyadh, will offer courses in subjects that Saudi women find difficult to study at universities where gender segregation is enforced. </p> <p>It will have a library, conference centres, 15 academic faculties, laboratories and a 700-bed hospital. There will be facilities for research into nanotechnology, bio-sciences and information technology.</p> <p>At the foundation-laying ceremony last week, which was attended by King Abdullah, the finance minister, Ibrahim Al-Assaf, told reporters the site would include housing for university staff, mosques, a school, a kindergarten and theme parks. </p> <p>Assaf described the project as a \"milestone\" in the kingdom's history. The higher education minister, Khaled al-Anqari, added: \"The king's presence shows his generous support for women's empowerment and his keen desire to promote higher education.\"</p> <p>This year Human Rights Watch accused the Saudi government of stopping women from enjoying their basic rights because they must often obtain permission from a guardian - a father, husband or son - to work, travel, study, marry or even access healthcare. </p> <p>In a 50-page report, Perpetual Minors: Human Rights Abuses Stemming from Male Guardianship and Sex Segregation in Saudi Arabia, researchers drew on more than 100 interviews with Saudi women to document the effects of discriminatory policies. The findings showed that the need fort women-only spaces was a disincentive to hiring female employees and that female students were often relegated to unequal facilities. </p> <p>One researcher, Farida Deif, told the Guardian the university would provide better education and employment opportunities.</p> <p>\"This university could be a very good thing if it had colleges offering instruction in engineering, media or law. There are already colleges with nursing and teaching disciplines. These areas are saturated and perpetuate specific gender roles.</p> <p>\"In terms of female education, the Saudi government has made great progress. Every statistic we've seen shows more enrolment in secondary and university education.\"</p> <p>The country still has the lowest female employment level in the world. Unesco figures show that women make up 58% of the total Saudi student population, but only 16% of the workforce. </p> <p>Segregation and the state policy of male guardianship mean women can only work in all-female environments, normally schools and hospitals. Women can lose their jobs if a male guardian informs the employer he wishes her to leave.</p> <p>It is unclear whether the university will have halls of residence. Women do not normally leave home before marriage and would not usually be permitted to move away in order to study. Those women who do live on campus encounter difficulties and constraints. </p> <p>In the course of her research, Deif spoke to medical students in Dammam, where they stayed in dormitories. \"They were severely restricted in terms of mobility and activity. They didn't have the power to leave the dormitory. It was a very closed environment.\"</p> <p>No information is available on how students will travel to the university. Women are barred from driving and public transport is not an option because of segregation. Women rely on a male guardian or privately hired driver. </p> <p>Government officials stressed the university's green credentials. Around 40,000 square metres of solar panelling will provide 16% of the campus's heating and 18% of the power required for air-conditioning.</p>",
  "<p>Police raided a wedding between a 7-year-old boy and a 5-year-old girl in Pakistan's largest city, arresting the Muslim cleric officiating at the ceremony and the children's parents, a senior officer said.</p> <p>The cleric had not yet begun the ceremony in Karachi, which was attended by 100 guests, said deputy superintendent of police, Malik Mazhar. Pakistan law forbids marriage below the age of 18, but some Muslim scholars say it is permissible if the bride and groom have reached puberty.</p> <p>TV footage showed both children in traditional wedding clothes in the laps of policemen after the raid, the girl with tears running down her cheeks.</p> <p>The parents said the wedding had been arranged to end an eight-year feud between the two families, according to a report on Express News TV. Mazhar said he had heard about similar cases in rural areas, but \"it is shocking to have this right in the centre of the city.\"</p> <p>The parents would be brought before a court today, he said. A Pakistan human rights commission official, Hina Gillani, said the maximum possible punishment for the parents was one month in prison and a fine of just over \u00a36.</p>",
  "<p>My father-in-law, Don Corner, died this week. It was very sudden and painless. He'd had a jolly lunch with us on Sunday, felt ill on Monday evening and died on Tuesday night. He was 87, clearly in good spirits up to the end, and, you'd have thought, pretty good health too. </p> <p>It's the way any of us would like to go, and he had been with many of the people he loved most. But a merciful, speedy death is difficult for those left behind, because it doesn't offer a chance to prepare for the grieving ahead.</p> <p>Don was one of what the Americans call the Greatest Generation, those who fought in the last war, stoically, bravely, usually without complaining, often almost enjoying it. War might be long periods of boredom interrupted by moments of absolute terror, but it also offered companionship, travel and a sense of purpose. </p> <p>He stayed in the navy and at one point became naval and military defence attach\u00e9 to Venezuela and Colombia, based in Caracas, from where - he proudly boasted - he never sent one useful piece of information back to London, though he did collect some fine orchids. After he retired he sold antiques in the Lanes in Brighton. I remember sharing a bottle of hock with him the lunchtime before the night of the Grand hotel bomb. He was selling crisp \u00a31 notes for \u00a34. I think there was something odd about them, but I never found out what. He claimed he knew more people who wrote for the Guardian than read it, and it was probably true.</p> <p>He liked beagling, drinking, talking, eating, walking, the Greek islands, and being with friends and family. He was wonderful to me. Unlike some fathers he never judged whether a partner was good enough for his son or daughter, but by what he could draw from them. He wanted to enjoy the people his children loved. He claimed he had never been photographed without a glass in his hand. We will all miss him dreadfully.</p> <p>\u2022 Judging by the papers, it might be a good time to go. Is there some kind of competition for the most panic-stricken headlines? We've got financial chaos, abysses, global collapse and Mad Max meltdown. The green lobby, terrified of being left behind, predicts that the death of the planet is coming much sooner than expected. I keep meeting people who have stopped listening to the Today programme because it sends them out to work with a black cloud drizzling over their heads.</p> <p>Yet even the paper themselves don't seem to take it seriously. Last Wednesday you would imagine that the most important thing going on in the world was the row over Ross and Brand's phone call to Andrew Sachs. (I think the most unsatisfactory thing about Russell Brand is his hair. You know that every apparently wild, straggling, untamed tress has been carefully teased into place.) We in the media seem to veer wildly between apocalyptic prophecies of doom and minuscule trivia, like manic depressives on a day out from the hospital.</p> <p>\u2022 There are joys to cling to. The other day, going to visit my own parents, I stopped in the market town of Wymondham, Norfolk, three miles from their care home. A friend of mine lives in the town, which is lovely. There are winding old streets, a market cross, and the superb Wymondham Abbey, which was started in the 12th century and is staffed exclusively by very nice people. </p> <p>Bill Bryson lives nearby, and he could live anywhere at all. We had lunch in the Green Dragon pub. It was one of those sunny but freezing days, so the wood-fired stove in the snug was quite as welcome as the real ale.</p> <p>And I've had a very agreeable PG Wodehouse sort of fortnight. Ten days ago was the biennial dinner of the PG Wodehouse society. It's strange but comforting to be with hundreds of people who are there only because they share a love of one writer. The guests were an extraordinary mix, including John Mortimer, Lara Cazalet, who is Wodehouse's great-granddaughter, and the Duke of Kent. Dr Shashi Tharoor, who just failed to become secretary general of the UN in 2006, gave a funny, deft speech, ending: \"May the sun always shine on Blandings, may young men always wear spats, and Jeeves resolve the global financial crisis.\" Hal Cazalet performed a Wodehouse song new to me, Tulip Time In Sing-Sing (\"that dear old-fashioned prison of mine\").</p> <p>This week I met Hal's father Sir Edward Cazalet at a party to celebrate the latest reprint of the Wodehouse oeuvre. It was held at the old John Murray headquarters, in Albemarle Street, Mayfair, where the drawing room, one of the most beautiful in the world, always makes my neck hairs prickle. </p> <p>Jane Austen took tea here, as did Byron, Darwin, Betjeman and Disraeli. Sir Edward saw a lot of his grandfather and recalled how he agonised over his scenarios and plots. But once he had sorted them out, he smoothly and speedily wrote that amazing row of books. \"And when he got the Times, he could do the crossword instantly, filling the answers in as if he was writing a letter.\"</p> <p>\u2022 You know Christmas is coming because the mad catalogues start arriving, offering items nobody needs, and which no sane person would give. A remote control for Christmas tree candles. Long-life batteries for your electrically heated insoles. A flexible roll-up shoe horn (\"say goodbye to stiff shoe horn misery\"). A silk sleeping bag to put inside your hotel bed in case of germs. A machine (at \u00a342.50) to clean your CDs and DVDs. My favourite so far - and if you see any more let me know - is a wooden box large enough to contain a bottle of wine, but fiendishly difficult to open. \"Watch in delight as your gift receiver tries to free the bottle from captivity!\" This costs \u00a319.99. In other words, you could send your friends three or four good bottles for the price of one that they can't even drink. What world do these people live in?</p>",
  "<p>Ra\u00fal Castro, president of Cuba and Fidel's younger brother, has always been an enigmatic figure. As diplomats in Cuba in the late 90s, we had never once in three years seen him in the flesh until our paths crossed on the tiny north-coast island of Las Brujas, 500km from Havana.</p> <p>It was May 2000. Roadblocks (due to a rally in a nearby coastal town) had made it impossible to reach the 48km causeway out to the island, until a local gave us directions to a bumpy back route. Puzzled that we had got past the police blockade, the soldier in charge of the causeway gate lifted the bar and let us through.</p> <p>The resort of Cayo Las Brujas was, at that time, no more than a wooden restaurant on a headland, a row of 10 or 12 cabins, and a small jetty. There was no one there except staff. They did not seem to be expecting us - a family party of three children and four adults - but after a few phone calls, they let us in.</p> <p>It soon became clear we weren't the only guests. Plain-clothes security men and bodyguards began to fill the place. And when Ra\u00fal Castro disembarked from a boat at the jetty, Juan Almeida Bosque vanished into one of the cabins and Guillermo Frias emerged from the bay, it finally dawned: we were alone with the commanders who landed from the Granma boat in 1956 to begin the Cuban revolution. </p> <p>Ra\u00fal avoids contact with foreigners, so we do no more than exchange diplomatic smiles and nods. But as the morning passes, the bodyguards relax. </p> <p>I'm only pretending to read in the shade of the restaurant cabin that overlooks the bay as the old comrades-in-arms do their exercises on the beach, then swim. Behind me a waiter is preparing drinks at the bar. Balancing his tray at shoulder level, he descends the wooden steps of the restaurant and solemnly sets off across the sand. Fully dressed, he wades in up to his waist, towards the generals. He waits patiently until the glasses are emptied, then returns to shore. He stands beside me, dripping. He has a message from the sea-bathers: El Comandante sends his apologies. He hopes he and his group are not spoiling your visit.</p> <p>At lunchtime, there is no sign of them and we think it safe to sit at the restaurant and have a beer. The waiters do not seem comfortable with the arrangement. When voices filter down the spiral staircase from the lookout point on the roof, we understand. They are above us, their binoculars scanning the horizon. </p> <p>Without warning, my mother-in-law reaches for her camera. She climbs the staircase with her interpreter (our youngest daughter) in tow. They do not return. Nick, my husband, thinks it time to intervene. Then the other two children follow, to be greeted by loud applause. By the time I join them, Matilda is on first-name terms with Ra\u00fal and Granny is engaged in teaching the generals some rudimentary English.</p> <p>They suggest lunch, and Ra\u00fal personally oversees the cooking of the seafood. He spreads tomatoes - from his garden - on the table. He barks out the placement, arranges chairs, lifts Matilda on to hers. He already knows all our names. When his shy granddaughter joins us, he engages her in a gentle tug-of-war as he proudly introduces her.</p> <p>Over lunch, they entertain us with stories of the revolution and, for an hour or two, we are in the Sierra mountains with the rebels, scratching out strategies in the dust. Our 10-year-old son is spellbound; Matilda is busy adjusting the gauge of Ra\u00fal's binoculars. A guitar and maracas appear, and the three generals, Jaime Crombet (vice-president of Cuba's National Assembly) and Carlos Lage (vice-president of the Council of State), in their straw hats and swimming shorts, sing old Cuban songs. </p> <p>At the end of this extraordinary afternoon, Ra\u00fal dispatches a bodyguard to drive our car back to Havana - we are to return in his plane. On the tarmac, we say our goodbyes and he promises to send Granny a photo of himself and his wife (Vilma Espin - revolutionary) on their 40th wedding anniversary. (He keeps his promise.)</p> <p>Three months later, as we end our posting to Cuba, we hold an official leaving party at home in Havana. We send Ra\u00fal Castro an invitation. It's only a gesture; we know he will not come. He doesn't, but he sends Arnaldo Tamayo M\u00e9ndez - Cuba's first and only cosmonaut - to convey his greetings on the day.</p> <p>Do you have an experience to share?

  "<h2>You're in a money purchase scheme</h2> <p>There are nearly four million workers in Britain with company pension schemes that rely entirely on the stock market. As the FTSE has plummeted, their hopes of a comfortable retirement have receded fast. Unfortunately I'm one of them. </p> <p>These are the so-called \"money purchase\" or \"defined contribution\" (DC) schemes which have replaced final salary pensions at hundreds of companies across the UK. Instead of the company promising you a portion of your final salary at retirement - they hate that, it's too expensive - you and the company pay into a scheme. Each month you pay in around 5% of your salary, while the company - if you're lucky - puts in a similar amount. The money's invested on the stock market and at retirement whatever you've built up is turned into an income. </p> <p>But what does this mean in practice? Have you and I really lost all this money? What sort of pension will I receive now? And precisely what can I and anybody else in a DC scheme do to repair the situation? </p> <p>This week, rather gingerly, I delved into my own pension at the Guardian. It's a standard DC scheme, managed by Legal &amp; General, with 85% of the money invested in stock market-listed shares. So how badly has the credit crunch hit home? </p> <p>In April 2007, my fund was worth \u00a375,304. Twelve months later it stood at \u00a380,720 - which seems good, until you factor in the \u00a38,918 the company and I paid in contributions during the period. Since then it has gone from just bad to plain awful. Last week the fund value stood at \u00a366,267 - and that's after paying in a further \u00a34,500. </p> <p>If I'd just put the money and contributions in the cash fund in April 2007, it would today be worth around \u00a390,000. In other words, the stock market fall has cost me close to \u00a325,000. </p> <p>I'm struggling here to find some good news, but one positive is that finding out about your DC scheme is easier than you might think. You can get an up-to-date valuation and a projection figure simply by calling or emailing your pensions department. </p> <p>Want to change where your money is invested? Again, it takes little more than downloading a form and sending it to your pension department. </p> <p>Virtually all DC schemes offer a choice of funds in which you can invest, mostly equity but also bond, gilts and cash options. Most people, understandably terrified by pensions, accept a company's \"default\" option. Typically, this puts you into a fund which is 80%-90% invested in shares until 10 years before retirement, at which point the fund starts shifting into cash and bonds to avoid the risk of a precipitous fall in markets just before retirement. </p> <p>If I'd had the foresight to switch into cash back in April 2007, a few minutes spent filling in a form would have saved me \u00a325,000. But does anybody really do this? The Guardian's pension department told me the overwhelming number of employees are, like workers at other companies, in the default option. But plenty of people - especially those above 50 and with more financial nous than others - do take control. </p> <p>Sure enough, I found them in the Guardian's City department. One reporter, now in his 50s, and with a large fund built up over many years of service, switched the whole lot into cash in March 2007. He reckons he has saved close to \u00a3100,000 - and says it took just a few minutes to do. \"I decided to do it after losing more in my pension between 2001-2003 than I earned from working. It taught me to watch my pension more closely,\" he told me. </p> <p>Is he going to put the money back into equities? For now, at least, he's happy to leave it in the cash fund. </p> <p>The rest of us would love to turn the clock back and do the same, but that's one option your pension department won't allow. The best alternative is to investigate additional voluntary contributions as a way to top up your pension. You choose to pay in extra amounts each month, tax free, from your monthly pay. Many companies will also top up contributions as well.</p> <p>For example, it costs a higher rate taxpayer just \u00a360 a month to see an extra \u00a3150 a month go into their pension if, as in the Guardian's case, the company chips in 50p for every \u00a31 extra paid by an employee. For what it's worth, I'll now be increasing my AVCs substantially. </p> <p>And before anyone thinks, hey, Collinson's not doing that badly, he's got \u00a366,000 in his pension, think again. The worst drawback of DC schemes is that you need to build up colossal sums if you have any hope of enjoying a decent income in retirement. A pot of \u00a366,000 pays an income for a single male at 65 of just \u00a3249 a month. That'll cover the council tax, then. </p> <p>My father's generation retired on pensions worth two-thirds of their final salary. Like most people in DC schemes, even if I pile in contributions for the next two decades, I'll retire on roughly 20% of my final salary.</p> <p>See you down at B&amp;Q. I'll be behind the counter.</p> <h2> You're in a final salary scheme?</h2> <p>There are nearly nine million people in Britain in top quality \"final salary\" based pensions. But are even these schemes safe from the global financial storm? </p> <p>Final salary schemes guarantee a pension according to the number of years you work for a company. Work for 40 years at the same employer and you can collect a pension worth two-thirds of your last salary. </p> <p>The good news is that even if a company goes bust, members are looked after by the Pension Protection Fund. If you are retired, the PPF guarantees 100% of your pension payments. </p> <p>If you are still working, it pays out 90%, up to a maximum of \u00a327,770 a year. But this is no time for complacency. Cash-strapped companies are increasingly desperate to limit their own liabilities. Recent action includes demanding that non-contributory members begin to pay, usually at least 5% a of salary every month; raising existing members; putting a bar on future \"accrual\" into the scheme; and basing the pension not on the final salary but on the lower \"career average\" salary instead.</p> <p>Annual pay rises for pensioners, linked to inflation, may also be withdrawn. It will be down to what individual contracts specify. </p> <p>Attractive \"accrual rates\" are also under pressure. A good scheme has a 1/60th rate. That means for every year you work, you receive entitlement to 1/60th of your final salary. </p> <p>After 40 years, you are at 40/60ths and earn a pension worth 2/3rds of your final salary. Many public sector schemes are on a 1/80th basis. </p> <p>About the best way to secure a good pension is to become an MP; their accrual rate is 1/40th - so they have to work just 26 years to be able to retire on two-thirds of final salary (currently \u00a361,820). </p> <p>The next best thing is to buy \"added years\" if you have not worked the maximum number of years at the company. Typically, you'll receive one extra year's \"service\" for a lump sum paid into the fund; how much this costs depends on your age, salary and how long you've been there </p> <p>Staff working for privately-owned companies don't usually have any limit to the number of years they can add, but many public sector pensions typically allow just five years extra. </p> <p>Despite the mass closure of final salary schemes to new members, there are a few still open to new joiners. </p> <p>It's one of the big attractions of getting a job at John Lewis Partnership: you have to wait for three years to join, but it's non-contributory scheme and the company says it's a major source of staff loyalty.</p> <h2>You're not in a pension scheme?</h2> <p>Worried about your financial future, but you earn less than average pay and are already in your 40s or 50s? Don't bother saving \u2014 go down the pub instead.</p> <p>Critics of Britain's fiendishly complex tax and benefi ts system say even saving as much as \u00a325,000 is hardly worth it, as the state will simply reduce your benefits nearly pound-for-pound when you retire. The current basic state pension is low: just \u00a390.70 a week. But assuming you have made enough National Insurance contributions, you will also receive a second state pension which can typically add a further \u00a340 a week.</p> <p>Even if you have a patchy NI payments history, you are automatically <br>entitled to Pension Credit, which takes a retired person's weekly income up to \u00a3124 (\u00a3189 for a couple). On top of that, housing benefit and council tax benefit can boost a pensioner's income. </p> <p>These benefits are by no means generous \u2014 around six in 10 Britons do not have towards retirement and will be totally dependent on state benefits. Anyone who wants to be guaranteed an income in retirement much above \u00a3150 a week will have to save either privately or through a company scheme.</p> <p>But unless you can save enough to generate an income that replaces those lost benefits, you could effectively be throwing money into a pot from which you'll ultimately see little benefit. \"Clearly someone in their 50s living on a low income, with a patchy work record and no savings is going to struggle to make up enough ground to see any real benefi t,\" says pensions expert Steve Bee of Scottish Life.</p> <p>The trouble is it is very difficult to say definitively what level of saving is<br>worthwhile . When you apply for pension credit, the government makes a calculation in which it looks at all of your incomes (from things such as company pensions) and all of your savings (from Isas to premium bonds and shares) and if they are above a certain limit, you don't qualify.</p> <p>But here comes the fiendishly complicated bit: the government doesn't recognise savings as merely the interest on your building society account. Instead it counts all your capital from all sources and for every \u00a3500 you have above \u00a36,000, it translates that as \u00a31 a week of income. And if you have a high \"income\" on this basis, bang goes your pension credit.</p> <p>Are you still with us? What it means is that if you have saved a lot, it counts against your pension credit. A total savings pot of \u00a325,000 translates into \u00a350 a week in \"income\" . Add this putative \u00a350 a week to a couple's \u00a3145 basic state pension, and they'll be above the \u00a3190 a week level at which pension credit runs out. This suggests that it's right to save \u00a36,000, as this won't affect your benefits. But if you save above that and as much as \u00a325,000, it is likely to be lost, partially or wholly, in reductions in benefits.</p> <p>Let's take the example of a lowincome person aged 50, who struggles to put aside \u00a3100 a month in savings. After 15 years that will add up to around \u00a325,900, assuming interest at 5%. The fi rst \u00a36,000 is safe, but above that there is limited benefit in saving more. The government says that its Pension Credit Savings Credit rewards those who have made a modest provision for their retirement with up to \u00a319.71 a week for single people and \u00a326.13 for couples. At current rates people with weekly incomes up to around \u00a3174 for single people and \u00a3255 for couples may still qualify for some savings credit.</p> <p>Pensions Minister Rosie Winterton says: \"It is vitally important that people save for their later life so they can enjoy their retirement. In the present climate people are tightening their belts and looking at their outgoings, but I would stress the importance of maintaining the saving habit now for the benefits it will bring 25 years down the line.\"</p> <p>But the choice over whether to save for your retirement will soon be out<br>of your hands. From 2012 all workers aged over 22 earning more than \u00a35,035 a year will be automatically enrolled into a company pension scheme or its new Personal Accounts, although they will retain the right to opt out. Individuals will have to contribute at least 4% of their salary. Companies must pay in at least 3% and the government will contribute a further 1%. Employers offering private schemes at least as good as the government's will be able to enrol their employees into these.</p> <p>Sadly, Personal Accounts system will suffer from the same savings-benefit trap. In a parliamentary question, Baroness Hollis of Heigham established from the DWP that if you earn less than \u00a320,000, and are less than 20 years from retirement, Personal Accounts will give you a limited lift in income.</p> <p>For more details, call the Pension Credit helpline on 0800 99 1234, open<br>8am to 8pm Monday to Friday.</p>",
  "<p>This is the first full-length biography of the most rivetingly interesting figure in late 19th-century radical politics. Edward Carpenter, alias the Saint in Sandals, the Noble Savage and, more recently, \"gay godfather of the British left\", was a writer, philosopher and charismatic propagandist for a multitude of causes, including anti-pollution, women's liberation, naturism, vegetarianism, animal rights, smallholdings, recycling. You name it, Carpenter espoused it from the start. </p> <p>His demands for more rational dress encompassed footwear, the freeing of the feet from \"the tyranny of shoe leather\". It was Carpenter who introduced the British to the Indian-style sandals that are still the sign and symbol of left-leaning politics. His most far-reaching campaign was for liberalising attitudes to homosexuality, at that time illegal. Carpenter the reformed gentleman lived with his working-class lover, George Merrill, in an early and controversial example of an openly gay relationship.</p> <p>Like William Morris, his contemporary and fellow socialist, Carpenter came from a comfortable background. The Carpenters were a naval family with a substantial income from property and shares. Early on he rejected the stifling atmosphere of their lavish house in fashionable Brighton. He despised the socially divisive capitalist system that allowed the ruling classes to live off the labour of the poor, \"consuming much, creating next to nothing\". Things did not have to be so complex. Determinedly and bravely, he reached his own solution. Carpenter was the inventor of that fascinating late-Victorian phenomenon we call \"the simple life\". </p> <p>Even as a child Carpenter had been aware of a strong attraction towards his own sex. Rowbotham makes links between Carpenter's sexual orientation and his visions for total social transformation, a new world in which men and women of all classes could live creatively together in love, beauty and freedom. Rejecting the emotional sterility of Cambridge, where Carpenter, by then ordained, held a clerical fellowship, he made his way north to live in Leeds and then in Sheffield. </p> <p>He had had his St Paul moment, a lightning flash of revelation felt as \"a vibration\" through his whole body, that he had to go and make his life with \"the mass of the people and the manual workers\", swarthy northern railway men and coach-builders, muscular and grimy riveters and grinders. If this sounds Whitmanesque, we should not be surprised. Carpenter was a disciple of Walt Whitman. Leaves of Grass, with its eroticisation of young working men, had \"filter'd and fibred\" his blood. Carpenter travelled twice to visit Whitman in New Jersey. Did he, as has been suggested, sleep with \"the old god\"? Rowbotham's researches have not been conclusive but there were at least \"erotic frissons\", and a sometimes startlingly frank correspondence between Carpenter and Whitman went on for many years. </p> <p>Sheffield in the 1870s was an \"environmental disaster\", as Rowbotham describes it, an industrial landscape of ugliness and squalor created by the rapid expansion of the steelworks and the cutlery trades. Carpenter countered this by retreating to the country, establishing small agricultural communities first at Bradway, then at Millthorpe in Derbyshire. He settled in a lovely tract of country - green fields, streams and wooded valleys beside the open moors.</p> <p>It was an active, rugged life of self-sufficiency. Carpenter had absorbed John Ruskin's views on the damage done to society by separating brain work, the province of the gentleman, from manual labour, lowly activity of the so-called working classes. In the new simplified life there had to be a balance. On his seven-acre site in Derbyshire, Carpenter himself dug the drains and hoed the land, planted fruit trees, fed the fowls and grew the crops, taking his own produce to market, where his fellow stallholders were evidently puzzled by his still unmistakably patrician tones. In his little wooden writing hut beside the stream, he poured out the pamphlets and treatises which argued that the moneyed classes could opt out of the capitalist system by paring down their wants to basic necessities and supplying their own simple communal needs.</p> <p>Most radically, Carpenter at Millthorpe lived alongside and had sex with local working-class men. He was crossing class barriers and sexual boundaries simultaneously. In researching this book Rowbotham has drawn on the Carpenter collection now in Sheffield city archive, a tremendously rich vein revealing a whole homosexual subculture in 19th-century industrial England. She uncovers an altogether different milieu from the more familiar metropolitan gay underworld of Oscar Wilde.</p> <p>It was a period in which same-sex love was still \"uncertain, tentative, experimental\". Rowbotham's own origins in the floating world of 1960s communes, graphically described in her memoir of her youth, Promise of a Dream, gives her a special sympathy for the many emotional tensions in Carpenter's sexually experimental households. Some of his male lovers were married or about to be. When the love of his life, the razor grinder George Hukin, announced his engagement, Carpenter, somewhat provocatively, gave the couple a marriage bed. Hukin wrote back anxiously: \"I do wish you could sleep with us sometimes Ted, but I don't know whether Fannie would quite like it yet.\" This book brings us tender insights into real human stories, poignant renegotiations of emotional and sexual territories played out against a background of Victorian political turmoil, bitter socialist infighting and anarchist trials.</p> <p>Millthorpe became a mecca for progressives. Architects and writers, Norfolk-jacketed schoolmasters and eager young lady Fabians piled into the long, low, ivy-covered cottage to watch simple life in action. William Morris was delighted by the uncluttered interior, precursor of 20th-century minimalist decor. Once the volatile and humorous Merrill was installed as Carpenter's live-in lover in 1898, the menage at Millthorpe became a demonstration of what might be possible for homosexual men. It was Merrill who, in a famous episode, laid a gentle finger on EM Forster's backside, just above the buttocks, directly inspiring the writing of Maurice. Forster's explicitly homosexual novel went unpublished until 1971.</p> <p>Carpenter was operating in a danger zone. His ceaseless propaganda for \"that special attachment which we sometimes call by the name of comradeship\" made him many enemies. Bernard Shaw accused him of \"Carpenterings and illusions\". Homogenic Love, his rationally argued pro-homosexual treatise, could only be privately circulated when it was completed in 1893. His Whitman-influenced long tone-poem \"Towards Democracy\" was passed from hand to hand by those who understood its hidden homosexual message. It was furtively referred to as \"the little green book\".</p> <p>Carpenter became an Edwardian guru figure, famous for the strength of his handclasp and the penetration of his gaze. He reminds us that the British labour movement always had its mystic side. When asked how he reconciled mysticism with socialism, Carpenter replied that he liked to hang out his red flag from the ground floor and then go up above to see how it looked. In search of secret harmonies, as well as \"good-looking chaps of the peasant class\", he travelled to Ceylon and then India. Trust Carpenter to find there a mysterious English nudist colony known as \"the Fellowship of the Naked Trust\".</p> <p>He retired to suburban Guildford, of all places. A heartbreaking photograph shows \"the Complete Anarchist\", the sage with all the answers, reduced to a baffled old man in a wheelchair. But by the time he died, in 1926, many of his ideas had been absorbed into the mainstream of our culture. Garden cities. Progressive schools such as Abbotsholme and Bedales. Craft communities including CR Ashbee's in the Cotswolds and Eric Gill's in Ditchling, living out the Carpenterian dream of making things by hand in idyllic rural settings. There were echoes of Carpenter in 1960s hippiedom and flower power, and in the memorable slogans of the period: \"The personal is political\"; \"Make love not war\". </p> <p>Carpenter campaigned doggedly for a higher level of emotional awareness. He set himself to challenge conventions and taboos that led to \"the starving of the human heart\". He was an essential force in the relatively recent changing of our attitudes to sex, and especially to same-sex relationships. His great hopes for the decriminalisation of homosexuality were finally achieved in 1967 with the passing of the Sexual Offences Act.</p> <p>Rowbotham has written a very good biography, exhaustively researched and resonant in detail. It is a splendid reassessment of a man who was both typical of his own time and light years ahead of it.</p> <p>\u2022 Fiona MacCarthy's books include Eric Gill (Faber)</p>",
  "<p>David Miliband, the foreign secretary, flew to the Democratic Republic of the Congo last night, as Britain joined a mounting diplomatic effort to end the interminable conflict in the east amid questions about the effectiveness of the UN peacekeeping mission there.</p> <p>Miliband will fly this morning from the capital, Kinshasa, to the stricken eastern town of Goma, as concerns grow about the plight of tens of thousands of people displaced by the latest bout of the conflict. </p> <p>He will proceed, with French counterpart Bernard Kouchner, to Rwanda as part of a mission to press as much as possible the Congolese and Rwandan governments to find a political solution to more than a decade of conflict that has claimed about 5 million lives, mostly from disease, and left more than one million as refugees.</p> <p>Kouchner asked Miliband to accompany him at short notice, and the foreign secretary agreed to go in the hope of maximising the pressure on all sides. \"The UK and France together really deliver Europe in Africa. It's a multiplier and it can deliver a serious message,\" a British official said.</p> <p>Rebel leader Laurent Nkunda has advanced to within 10 miles of Goma, uprooting tens of thousands of people. </p> <p>Nkunda says he is fighting to protect his Tutsi community from attack by Hutu rebels from Rwanda. Government forces have fled. Yesterday, there were reports that camps sheltering 50,000 displaced people had been burned.</p> <p>The EU is considering sending forces to the area, and the UN is appealing for more troops for what is already the largest peacekeeping force in the world. </p> <p>But the visits come amid concern that the UN force is fighting a war that government forces are no longer prepared to fight, and in doing so is siding with extremist Hutus responsible for the genocide in neighbouring Rwanda.</p> <p>Critics of the UN operation, and some of its own staff, say the mission is complicating efforts to reach a peace settlement because instead of pressing for the disarmament of all major rebel groups, the UN has in effect taken sides against Nkunda, on behalf of a government whose forces are deeply implicated in human rights abuses and more interested in making money from gold smuggling than fighting. The government's army is also allied with exiled Rwandan Hutu rebels.</p> <p>UN officials in Congo privately say they have been left by the major powers to do an impossible job because of lack of international political will to confront the causes of the conflict.</p> <p>As tens of thousands fled this week, people vented their anger at the UN's failure to fulfil its mandate of protecting civilian lives. Residents of Goma stoned UN compounds as Nkunda's forces marched on the town and government forces fled. An Indian officer was critically injured. </p> <p>The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, said peacekeepers are \"doing everything possible to protect civilians and fulfil their mandate in untenable circumstances\". One UN official said untenable meant that peacekeepers were expected to fight when the government's army will not. </p> <p>Alan Doss, the UN envoy to Congo, said the peacekeepers have served with \"really great distinction\" but that there are not enough of them to protect the population. But critics say that more troops are not the answer because the UN has been given a role it cannot fulfil and has become deeply compromised as a result.</p> <p>Neil Campbell, a researcher for the International Crisis Group, who recently visited Goma, said it was not feasible to expect the UN to protect civilians outside of a few urban areas, given the size of eastern Congo and the array of armed groups.</p> <p>\"The UN has been projected as the body that's going to bring democracy and stabilisation to the north-east of Congo, which is completely unrealistic,\" he said.</p> <p>\"The problem is the UN has been forced into fighting by the disintegration of the [government's] army. When I was in Goma, the sense of a lack of discipline and any kind of military cohesion within the armed forces is incredible ... The armed forces have been running away from the rebels, so the UN has been forced into a role that it wasn't supposed to be taking.\"</p> <p>The UN has concentrated on trying to prevent the various rebel groups from taking over major towns. In doing so, it has been drawn in on one side of the conflict on the grounds that it was defending a democratic government in Kinshasa.</p> <p>But that role was compromised because government forces were often responsible for human rights abuses, including murder and rape, and are involved in making money from illegal mining operations. </p> <p>Global Witness recently accused sections of the Congolese army of mining gold and tin in league with the Rwandan Hutu rebel group the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), whose leaders are implicated in the 1994 genocide.</p> <p>Some UN peacekeepers have also been accused of involvement in the illegal mining trade and gold smuggling.</p> <p>Congo's president, Laurent Kabila, has also been protecting the FDLR because its forces have proved more willing to fight than his own troops. Campbell said the scramble for control of mines remains a driving force behind the conflict.</p> <p>\"Everyone is gaining something from the North Kivu crisis,\" he said. \"Nkunda presents himself as being the protector of the Tutsis in North Kivu. He's nothing of the sort. He's not a freedom fighter, his primary goals are economic and political.\"</p>",
  "<p>Seventeen Chinese prisoners who have been held for nearly seven years in Guant\u00e1namo Bay will be informed on Monday that they could spend the rest of their lives behind bars, even though they face no charges and have been told by a judge they should be freed. </p> <p>No country is willing to accept them and the US justice department has now blocked moves for them to be allowed to go to the US mainland, where they had been offered a home by refugee and Christian organisations.</p> <p>The men's lawyer, Sabin Willett, is flying to Guant\u00e1namo Bay this weekend to break the news to the men, who are members of the Uighur ethnic group seeking autonomy from China. In a blunt and angry letter to justice department lawyers, Willett spelled out what he thought of the way the men had been treated.</p> <p>\"After years of stalling and staying and appellate gamesmanship, you pleaded no contest - they are not enemy combatants,\" Willett has written. \"You have never charged them with any crime.\" </p> <p>Last month a federal judge ruled that the men should be freed. \"They were on freedom's doorstep,\" said Willett. \"The plane was at Gitmo. The stateside Lutheran refugee services and the Uighur families and Tallahassee clergy were ready to receive them.\" However, the justice department appealed against the ruling and Willett claims this will put the men into a potentially endless limbo. </p> <p>Yesterday Willett said his clients were \"saddened\" by the latest events. The men, who are Muslims, were in Afghanistan in 2001 and were captured by Pakistani troops and handed over to the US. So far, more than 100 countries have been asked to take them as refugees but none have agreed. Willett blamed US authorities for incorrectly describing them as terrorists. </p> <p>According to the US justice department, the men \"are linked to an organisation that the state department has labelled to be a terrorist entity, and it is beside the point that the organisation is not 'a threat to us' because the law excluding members of such groups does not require such proof.\" </p> <p>Willett is also angry the defence department will not agree to let him meet his clients unless they are chained to the floor. He called for this restriction to be lifted: \"Just permit these men one shred of human dignity.\" He added: \"Americans are not supposed to treat enemy prisoners of war this way under the service field manuals, or the Geneva conventions - if anyone paid attention to the field manuals or the Geneva conventions anymore.\"</p>",
  "<p>\"It's your BBC,\" the slogan used to run, imploring the audience to engage with the broadcaster. After five years of encouraging viewers and listeners to \"have your say\", \"press the red button\" and \"leave a comment on our blog\", the BBC this week found itself on the wrong end of what might be termed \"interactivism\". </p> <p>More than 37,000 complaints about the infamous Russell Brand radio show led to resignations, inquiries, apologies and a few more cracks in the facade of Broadcasting House. Interactivism is changing the terms of engagement for media organisations, politicians, companies and individuals. </p> <p>It may seem absurdly inappropriate to compare the significance of the US elections next week with the trivia of Jonathan Ross and Russell Brand mucking around on the radio, but both share this common thread. </p> <p>Barack Obama may soon become the first politician to be carried to power by interactivism, in terms of funding and campaigning. </p> <p>With half of his $500m (\u00a3303m) campaign fund coming from donations of less than $200 through internet fundraising, the Obama campaign has harnessed electronic media to devastating effect, and melded the idea of grassroots activism with instant feedback and visible networks.</p> <p>If Obama has successfully harnessed the power of interactivism, Radio 2 is reeling from its impact. </p> <p>When Brand's show first aired, two people complained. After a week, thanks to the huffing and puffing of the Daily Mail, the Sun - and the BBC's own echo chamber of 24-hour news - complaints had rocketed to more than 37,000. By complaining to the BBC and Ofcom, the public could join in a story. An odd and perhaps not very useful argument for public engagement but indisputably powerful. </p> <p>Message boards, Facebook groups and phone-ins were deluged with protest over a wide range of issues; not least subjective dislike for either Brand or Ross or both. </p> <p>It was unclear how many had heard the shows or extracts - it didn't matter. Complaint becomes a participation sport in a digital world, where totals are electronically tallied and regularly updated. Most importantly, by participating, the public expects to influence the outcome of events.</p> <p>Just as television companies have built new audiences and revenues on encouraging us to vote on anything and everything, so they are now at risk of being undone by failing to understand the implications of interactivity which is not under their control. </p> <p>This is where the Obama campaign is also instructive. The viral messages, email campaigns and rapid rebuttal which take on attacks at lightning speed are as much a part of team Obama's extraordinary success as the fundraising.</p> <p>Technology is amoral and the connectivity which helps a civil rights movement can equally be the platform for a lynch mob. There is no implicit democracy in interactivism - the most organised and connected, the most vociferous and offended can tip the balance. </p> <p>Online response is instant, and often lightly committed and should sometimes be treated as such. Perhaps next time the viral activism will be directed against corruption in politics or against social injustice.</p> <p>\u2022 Emily Bell is director of digital content for Guardian News and Media</p>",
  "<p>Roy Keane has warned he will haul players off after five minutes against Chelsea if he senses any repeat of the sloppiness that led to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/sunderland\">Sunderland's</a> midweek defeat at Stoke City. </p> <p>Keane was struggling to control his emotions yesterday on the eve of the trip to Stamford Bridge as he accused his players of making him look an average manager on Wednesday night. Having enjoyed the euphoria of a north-east derby win over Newcastle last weekend, Keane described the performance at Stoke as the worst of the season and insisted there will be repercussions. </p> <p>\"I try not to lose my temper because it takes me four days to recover if I do,\" said Keane. \"But I have certainly expressed my disappointment because my performance the other night was average as a manager. We are working on the inconsistency. That is a problem with any mid-table or bottom-of-the-table team and is part of the frustration of being a manager, the frustration with players. We had that the other night. I am looking for a response. There were concerns after the decent performance last weekend. Players turn up and think it is automatically going to happen. </p> <p>\"I knew after five minutes it would be a long night. After five minutes I should have made changes. There were sloppy passes, people not sprinting for the ball and weak tackles. It just sends a message you are not 100% mentally switched on.\" Having signed 10 new players in the summer, Keane admits he is still learning what makes them tick, but he hopes they will respond on this occasion. \"I will certainly make changes for Chelsea. They let themselves and their team-mates down. It won't be tolerated. </p> <p>\"Jose Mourinho made brave decisions when he was at Chelsea, he took players off in the first half if he didn't like what he saw and I should have done that, I should have been braver. I don't care if it reflects badly on the player. It can be a risk and sometimes you have to take risks to get to the top.\" </p> <p>Of the current Chelsea manager, Luiz Felipe Scolari, Keane said: \"He seems to be a nice, happy-go-lucky character who knows football inside out.\"</p>",
  "<h2>Things that go flush in the night</h2> <p><strong>We are about to replace our bathroom suite and the only place the WC can go is against our long-suffering neighbours' bedroom wall. What can we do to minimise the sound of the flush? Is a wall-mounted one out of the question? </strong></p> <p>Our DIY expert, Bridget Bodoano, says, 'Building a false wall on the party wall and filling it with acoustic material will do much to reduce noise nuisance. To be effective, this needs to be around 120-170mm deep. You can have a wall-hung WC if you have space to build a casing for the cistern (around 300-350mm), room for the lavatory pan (minimum 450mm - look at the Ideal Standard Space range,<a href=\"http://ideal-standard.co.uk/\"> ideal-standard.co.uk</a>) and space to sit down, all of which would require a minimum of around 1500mm. </p> <p>'Wall-hung WCs are fixed to a frame incorporated into the casing (see <a href=\"http://www.grohe.co.uk/\">grohe.co.uk</a> and <a href=\"http://www.geberit.co.uk/geberit/inet/uk/wcmsuk.nsf/pages/index\">geberit.co.uk</a>). The casing encloses the pipework, too, and not only looks neat but can be filled with sound-dampening material for further noise reduction. The helpful man at CP Hart (020-7902 1000, <a href=\"http://cphart.co.uk/\">cphart.co.uk</a>) points out that the noise of flushing has been reduced in modern fittings - old lavatory pans normally had only two holes under the rim, so the noise of water being forced through was quite loud; modern pans have around 20 holes and are much quieter. In addition, new cisterns fill through a kind of sleeve, which cuts the noise of water hitting water. He also mentioned that pipework can be noisy - vibrations are not unusual and hot-water pipes can make a lot of noise when they contract, so ensure your pipes are securely held in place. </p> <p>'Before starting any work, check you are not breaching building regulations with regard to party walls and positioning of the soil pipe (<a href=\"http://planningportal.gov.uk/\">planningportal.gov.uk</a>).

  "<p>When <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/englandrugbyleagueteam\">England</a> face <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/australiarugbyleague\">Australia</a> in their first defining challenge of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/rugbyleagueworldcup2008\">World Cup</a> tomorrow, the coach, Tony Smith, will be employing some very unorthodox thinking. He will relay messages to the players through a management consultant who previously worked as a human resources director for Unilever.</p> <p>Damian Hughes's varied CV also includes a couple of brief encounters with Brian Clough as a schoolboy trainee with Nottingham Forest, five years on the junior coaching staff at Manchester United, a classics degree from Leeds University, helping his dad to keep Mancunian youth on the straight and narrow at the Collyhurst and Moston Lads Club - Brian Hughes was awarded the MBE in 2000 for his services to boxing, which included coaching Robin Reid to a world title - and publishing three books on organisational psychology.</p> <p>That is a suitably unorthodox background for a ground-breaking rugby league appointment, which follows the trail blazed by Sir Clive Woodward who described the round-the-world yachtsman turned motivational guru Humphrey Walters as a key figure behind England's World Cup success in Australia in the other rugby code five years ago.</p> <p>The brief of Hughes, pictured right, is both straightforward and daunting: instilling a belief in the England players that they can end Australia's long dominance of international rugby league.</p> <p>\"It's taken a lot of courage on Tony's part to bring somebody like me in,\" said the 35-year-old, who addressed the players in a team meeting in their Melbourne hotel on the bank of the Yarra last night. \"The orthodox thing is to ask how many caps you've won and stuff like that.</p> <p>\"But when you're at the level these guys are, talent equals itself out. Physically there's very little different, and tactically, Tony's a world-class coach. So it comes down to mentality and how you deal with pressure and change and issues like that. That's what might make the difference in this World Cup.</p> <p>\"The pressure on the players does become more intense. The other night we went to a reception in Melbourne which was supposed to be a celebration of 100 years of England playing Australia, but the videos they showed were of about 50 Australian tries, and then some fleeting footage of us being successful before 1963.</p> <p>\"The good thing was the players were all aware of it and as we came away they laughed about it. It was just another example of them trying to convince us that we've got no chance, and that they're superior. It's important to be aware of that and be prepared for it.\"</p> <p>Hughes's connection with Smith goes back to a chance encounter with the Leeds captain and England loose forward Kevin Sinfield during a sports discussion progamme hosted by the late Tony Wilson on BBC Radio Manchester three years ago.</p> <p>\"Kevin invited me to come and see Tony, and we just hit it off straight away,\" Hughes explained. \"When he got the England job he gave me a role as coaching consultant. Rather than impose standards on the players we allowed them to have control, and they imposed on themselves a more stringent set of standards than any of the coaches would have done.</p> <p>\"They are a very impressive bunch. With the boxing and when I was coaching at United I've been around a rarefied atmosphere, and seen the sacrifices that are required. I've seen it in business too and this lot are as good as any I've seen.\"</p> <p>They were not overly impressive in beating Papua New Guinea 32-22 in their opening World Cup game in Townsville last Saturday, making an improved performance against Australia tomorrow imperative for their credibility even though both teams are almost certain to make the semi-finals whatever the result.</p> <p>But Hughes stresses that they are working to a five-week plan. \"It's not where you start, it's how you finish. In rugby union, can you remember who England played in their first few games when they won the World Cup? The focus is on who we play on November 22 and this is just a step along the way.\"</p> <p><strong>England:</strong> <strong>Wellens</strong>; <strong>Gardner</strong> both St Helens, <strong>Gleeson</strong> Warrington, <strong>Senior</strong> Leeds, <strong>Calderwood</strong> Wigan; <strong>Pryce</strong> St Helens, <strong>Burrow</strong> Leeds; <strong>Peacock</strong> Leeds, capt, <strong>Roby</strong>, <strong>Graham</strong> both St Helens, <strong>Hock</strong> Wigan, <strong>Ellis</strong>, <strong>Sinfield</strong> both Leeds. <strong>Interchange:</strong> <strong>McGuire</strong> Leeds, <strong>Morley</strong> Warrington, <strong>Fa'asavalu</strong>, <strong>Wilkin </strong>both St Helens.</p> <p><strong>Australia:</strong> <strong>Slater</strong> Melbourne; <strong>Monaghan</strong> Canberra, <strong>Inglis</strong>, <strong>Folau</strong> both Melbourne, <strong>Tate</strong> NZ Warriors; <strong>Lockyer</strong> Brisbane, capt, <strong>Thurston</strong> North Queensland; <strong>Civoniceva</strong> Penrith, <strong>Smith</strong> Melbourne, <strong>Price</strong> NZ Warriors, <strong>Stewart</strong> Manly, <strong>Laffranchi</strong> Gold Coast, <strong>Gallen</strong> Cronulla. </p> <p><strong>Interchange:</strong> <strong>Kite</strong>, <strong>Perry</strong> Manly, <strong>Tupou</strong> Sydney Roosters, <strong>Hunt</strong> Brisbane.</p> <p><strong>Referee </strong>Tony Archer (Aus).</p> <h2>Green and golden rules</h2> <p>Five reasons why Australia have dominated rugby league for so long.</p> <p><strong>Playing numbers</strong></p> <p>League is the most popular football code in New South Wales and Queensland, so it has tended to have first pick of talent.</p> <p><strong>League clubs</strong></p> <p>The wealth of the Sydney teams was down to the social clubs alongside them, which in many cases became huge entertainment complexes.</p> <p><strong>Training methods</strong></p> <p>In the late-70s coaches like Jack Gibson and Terry Fearnley looked to the NFL to develop new techniques, helping to produce a new generation of athletes far superior to Great Britain's.</p> <p><strong>State of Origin</strong></p> <p>The introduction of the ferocious battles between Queensland and New South Wales in 1980 provided a level of competition far more intense than anything in England.</p> <p><strong>Darren Lockyer</strong></p> <p>Whenever Great Britain have gone close to ending Australia's supremacy in recent years, the Brisbane Broncos stand-off has responded to the challenge.</p>",
  "<p>It's fitting that the cynicism \"vote early and vote often\" is commonly attributed to Chicago's Democratic boss, mayor Richard Daley, who famously voted the graveyards in 1960 to help put John Kennedy in the White House. In this 2008 race, it's the American media that have voted very early and often. They long ago elected the star graduate of Chicago's Democratic machine, Barack Obama. </p> <p>I am not talking of editorials in newspapers, though Obama has the preponderance of the endorsements over John McCain. Obama certainly deserves the credit for recruiting impressive advisers and running a more efficient campaign machine than any one in the US's political history. </p> <p>What's troubling to anyone old-fashioned enough to care about standards in journalism is the news coverage in mainstream media. Forget the old notions of objectivity, fairness, thoroughness, and so on. The nastiest rumours on both sides haven't been published, but the coverage has been slavishly on the side of \"the one\". </p> <p>It has not just been anti-Republican. It goes without saying that after eight years of George Bush's macho blunders, the disenchantment of even the conservative outlets was bound to show. Researchers at the Project for Excellence in Journalism report that in the six weeks since the Republican convention, McCain, once the darling of the media, got four times as many negative stories as positive ones. Meanwhile, Obama got twice as many positive stories as McCain. The website Politico has also acknowledged that it had loaded the dice against McCain: 100 stories were more favourable to Obama than McCain; 69 were the opposite.</p> <p>But the press bias towards Obama doesn't represent a simple revulsion for the Republican party. It was on display in the Democratic primaries with the persecution of Hillary Clinton. Worst of all, in the primaries, the press let the Obama campaign get away with continuous insinuations below the radar that the Clintons were race-baiters. Instead of exposing that absurd defamation for what it was - a nasty smear - the media sedulously propagated it.</p> <p>Clinton made the historically correct and uncontroversial remark that civil rights legislation came about from a fusion of the dreams of Dr Martin Luther King and the legislative follow-through by President Lyndon Johnson. The New York Times misrepresented that as a disparagement of King, twisting her remarks to imply that \"a black man needed the help of a white man to effect change\". This was one of a number of manipulations on race by the Obama campaign, amply documented by the leading Democratic historian, Princeton's Sean Wilentz. Clinton came close to tears in a coffee shop in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, which many thought helped her to win an upset victory there. MSNBC television gave a platform to the Chicago congressmen, Jesse Jackson Jr, where he questioned her tears and claimed that she'd not shed any tears for the black victims of Katrina, and that she'd pay for that in the South Carolina primary, where 45% of the electorate would be African-Americans. </p> <p>In fact, MSNBC ran a non-stop campaign for Obama propelled by the misogyny of its anchors, Chris Matthews, Keith Olbermann and David Shuster. Chelsea Clinton joining Clinton's campaign prompted Shuster to report she was \"pimping\" for her mother. </p> <p>Obamania has not been deflated one bit by the non-stop talkers on rightwing radio. They offer vituperation in place of enlightenment; paranoia in place of policies, and as such have little influence with the crucial independents. </p> <p>On the web, the rightwing Drudge Report highlights anything that favours McCain, the Huffington Post does the same for Obama, and the more independent Slate has said only one of its staff intends to vote for McCain, the other 55 for Obama. Fox News has the vehement Sean Hannity paired with the mildly liberal Alan Colmes, not a fair match, but it has been more willing to investigate than CNN. In the Democratic primaries, there was a pattern on CNN where the short news videos of Clinton rarely let you hear what she was saying, but the short news videos of Obama let his words come through. I mentioned this to a CNN editor who said, \"Oh, that's our young video editors, they just find Obama more exciting.\" </p> <p>The young and affluent liberals have been captivated by Obama's charisma, the unstated notion that electing a black man will be absolution for the years of discrimination and prejudice, and the expectation that Obama's undoubted appeal to the outside world will repair America's image. All understandable, but these emotions have been allowed to swamp the commonplace imperatives of journalism: curiosity and scepticism. </p> <p>All the mainstream national outlets were extraordinarily slow to check Obama's background. And until it became inescapable because of a video rant, they wouldn't investigate the Reverend Jeremiah Wright connection for fear of being accused of racism. They wouldn't explore Obama's dealing with the corrupt, now convicted, Chicago businessman Tony Rezko. They haven't investigated Obama's pledge to get rid of the secret ballot in trade union affairs. After years of inveighing against \"money in politics\", they've tolerated his breach of the pledge to restrict himself to public financing as McCain has done (to his cost). Now the LA Times refuses to release a possibly compromising video, which shows Obama praising Palestinian activist Rashid Khalidi at a 2003 banquet, saying its promises to its source prevent it from doing so.</p> <p>The British press is notorious for political distortions, which more or less balance out. But the American press likes to think of itself as more superior and detached than it actually is. In 2000, the mainstream media did a great deal to elect George Bush by portraying Al Gore as a boastful liar. </p> <p>Let's hope the consequences of electing \"the one\" will be as wondrous as the press has led the voters to believe. </p> <p>\u2022 Harold Evans is former editor of the Times and the Sunday Times, and author of The American Century</p>",
  "<p>Every United States presidential election is important. Most of them provide dramatic political theatre. All of them are compulsively watched by the rest of the world. The election of 2008, however, is a record-breaker in all departments. It is important because it comes at the end of George Bush's calamitous two terms and amid such economic turmoil. It is memorable because it has involved so many ground-breaking candidates and long campaigns on both sides. And it has been watched and experienced by the world as no American election has been before. Not since the Kennedy era has such a contest resonated so potently with so many people in America and beyond, including in this country. But the circumstances of this year's contest, the character of the protagonists and the immediacy of the internet age combine to mean that the 2008 election is likely to make a defining statement about America for this global generation that may eclipse even the impact of the contest of 1960.</p> <p><strong>World interest</strong></p> <p>Though we lack the vote, this is our election too. Such statements outrage many Americans and inspire others. But the rest of the world has not just lived this election. Our life chances and societies will also be shaped by what happens next Tuesday. The world has an interest in the outcome because, in spite of everything, America remains the world's pre-eminent military, political, financial and cultural power. America's standing in the world has been damaged during the Bush years. He has inflicted massive direct harm to many parts of the world through his military actions, has set back the quality of life on our planet by his indifference to climate change, international cooperation and the rule of law. He has been anti-Americanism's best recruiting sergeant and al-Qaida's too.</p> <p>The world may not have the vote on Tuesday. But it certainly has a candidate. That candidate is Senator Barack Obama. If the world could vote on November 4, Mr Obama would win by a landslide. Polling shows him preferred in Egypt by two to one, in Poland by three to one, in Canada by five to one, in Brazil by six to one, in Britain by seven to one, in France by 11 to one and in Kenya by more than 17 to one. </p> <p>He is not just the preferred choice of liberal Europeans. He is also the choice of the rest of the world, of all races and creeds - and of young people in particular. No buses crammed with lawyers would be needed to validate the accuracy of these votes. He commands this support, not only because he is not George Bush but because he personifies so much of what the world still admires about America. Americans ought to think about that. The world longs, perhaps unrealistically but palpably nevertheless, for a new America. Only Mr Obama can provide that.</p> <p>John McCain manifestly would not do this. Eight years ago, Mr McCain offered himself as a punchy and principled alternative to Mr Bush. The McCain of 2008 has been very different. He has made too many compromises with the social conservative wing of his party and in the last few weeks has run a partisan campaign in an attempt to re-energise the Republican faithful. His response to the economic crisis triggered by the credit crunch and the collapse of Lehman Brothers has been parlous. His party faces a bitter and enduring self-examination if it loses next week.</p> <p>By choosing Sarah Palin as his running mate, he made a huge error of both tactical and strategic judgment. Mrs Palin may have entranced the celebrity-driven parts of the media, but she has relentlessly alienated American voters, nearly 60% of whom now believe that she is not qualified to be the nation's vice-president. Mr McCain has made much of his experience and readiness to lead, but in this campaign he has been found lamentably wanting. </p> <p>When the 2008 campaign began, Mr Obama stood for two things. He was against the Iraq war and he was in favour of a break with the embattled partisan politics of America's recent past. He was the candidate offering hope and change. He is still all those things today, but he has become much more than that. Over the past 20 months he has been tested in debate, in campaigning skills, and on policy. At each turn he has responded with enviable coolness and clarity of judgment and language, while developing a detailed programme of commitments on the issues that would shape his presidency - healthcare, economic restoration, the federal budget, energy and Iraq.</p> <p>His performance in the televised debates was formidable, showcasing the discipline that has been such a feature of his campaign. He has responded well to the financial crisis, after a cautious start. In his 30-minute campaign infomercial this week, he reiterated the key pledges that he has made throughout this campaign, with a radical sustainable energy programme as a hallmark. Attacked by the Republicans as a redistributionist and a socialist, he has held his ground, insisting that America needs to be a fairer society. </p> <p><strong>High expectations</strong></p> <p>The voters may give the Democrats a clean sweep in Congress and the White House next week. Expectations will be high, hard to manage, and the honeymoon may not last. Yet Mr Obama will be in an enviable position. He will have the political space to write a new chapter for centre-left American governance. His election would mark the end of the conservative era that began under Ronald Reagan and which so inhibited the Democrats of the 1980s and 90s. His race is part of his appeal, and if he is elected it will mark a historic moment in American public life. But it is not, in the end, the central question next week. Mr Obama's greatest achievement is to have seized on the failures of the Republican era and to have developed a serious new progressive coalition and programme. America stands on the threshold of a new era. That is what the nation needs and the world craves, and Americans should elect Barack Obama as their president.</p>",
  "<p>So who's in charge here - the government lending \u00a337bn to bail out badly run banks or the bankers that caused the crisis? The chancellor is attempting to crack the whip and toughen the voluntary code on lending to small business. The banks veer between protesting that they are lending just as much as in 2007 to suggesting it's none of the government's business. Darling has his ambiguities, anxious not to micromanage banks even when we, the people, are the biggest shareholders. The European Investment Bank tries to ensure the \u00a34bn promised this week is lent at fair rates, but the government has yet to persuade every bank to use it for easier lending.</p> <p>The two sides have been locked in talks all week; the government promising an agency to manage its banking investments and a forum where small businesses can meet banks to complain. Observers say the banks' gratitude at being saved was shortlived: now they negotiate ferociously. Barclays preferring to be beholden to Qatari and Abu Dhabi potentates, rather than submit to British (Labour) government regulation, says it all. It would rather keep paying big bonuses - \u00a320m to its top man - and now its shares have tumbled. All banks shudder in ideological horror at the idea of being partly nationalised.</p> <p>Here is how things look from one of the great glass towers of banking (a bank that only let me in on condition of anonymity). The man in charge of lending to small business is going through a sheaf of loan applications. A restaurant wants to increase its overdraft, pleading to be helped until the good times roll again. \"But that would do no favours to him or us. His problem is not lack of credit, it's lack of customers. Lending more won't bring them back through his door. Better to call it a day now.\" So it's a no.</p> <p>How about the golf club that borrowed last year to diversify into paint-balling? Business was disappointing this summer, but they are sure it will pick up. No, says the bank, it won't, so retrench back to your core golfing and lay off staff. It's no to the small property developer wanting to buy a bargain to convert it into four flats. \"Last year no problem, but those days are gone.\" A nursing home waiting for delayed local council bills is a sound bet: it gets its credit. A high-quality butcher staggering when a celebrity chef went bust leaving a \u00a350,000 debt gets his money because the queues round the block show business holding up. Management consultants, lawyers and accountants who thrive whatever the climate get the OK.</p> <p>This bank says it is approving 10% fewer loans than last year: insolvencies are up by 5%. It swears its lending criteria remain unaltered but says the risk out there has changed. It swears its interest rates are, as ever, 2% above interbanking lending rates, their usual profit margin: it's not their fault London interbank offer rates rose so high. A senior manager here, involved in the negotiations with government, is holding his ground. \"It's dangerous to force us to take on more risk. They keep promising 'a bail-out for small business', but what does that mean?\" He has an air of determined defiance - and maybe an undertow of contempt for politicians (Labour especially?) who are not bankers. </p> <p>But out there, far beyond this great glass palace, the Federation of Small Businesses declares this bank and the rest are lying through their teeth: its claims the figures to prove it. Half their members find it hard to get credit, even small regular sums for day-to-day transactions in solid firms. They say what bank head offices tell the press and government bears no resemblance to what local bank managers do, accusing them of sending coded messages to their branches rewarding them for cutting back debt. The FSB says: \"It is time to tear up the rulebook to save millions of small businesses that drive our economy and employ 60% of the workforce.\"</p> <p>It has no shortage of cases. I talked yesterday to a Welsh scaffolder who cannot get a promised \u00a33,000 overdraft from his bank to get his second lorry on the road and hire another man to fulfil work he's having to pass on to other companies. Or there is the technology public relations firm owner showing me the standard letter sent out by his bank - which happens to be the very one I spent time with - telling him without notice in September his interest rate \"will be changing from 6.87% to 10.87% above base rate. Please may I reassure you that our commitment to your business hasn't changed.\" </p> <p>What is the truth of this? I asked two bankers involved in the negotiations if the government has demanded details of how they lend now compared with last year. No, they said, they haven't had to provide those accounts. Labour needs to clear a quick path through this thicket to make sure the funds made available really do reach businesses in need. Naturally, the government is no keener than banks to throw money at doomed businesses, so it hesitates to second-guess \"the experts\". But this must be a good time to face down the myth that bankers always know best.</p> <p>One irony is that Labour will win scant gratitude for championing small business. They will probably stay Tory, despite George Osborne's error yesterday in opposing borrowing, even to ease the pain for small business. The British Chambers of Commerce still flaunts its absurd Burdens Barometer, claiming that this year Labour's extra regulations have cost business \u00a365bn since 1997. The \"burdens\" include such frivolities as maternity leave, stakeholder pensions and the control of pesticides and asbestos. Will Labour battling with the bankers on their behalf turn them into Labour supporters? Don't count on it. </p> <p>The government's \u00a337bn doesn't start to flow until January, so there is still time to nail down a cast-iron method of forcing banks to lend and not hoard the cash. Yet some lending still gushes forth. A virtually penniless client of HBOS sends this offer she just received from her bank: \"\u00a310,000 is reserved and waiting for you! As a valued customer we've reserved you a personal loan at a rate of just 8.8%. If you wish you can apply for more ...\" After writing last week about bankruptcies due to personal debt, many others with no money have showered me with similarly irresponsible offers. So the idea that banks always know best should have Alistair Darling at least raising one of his famous eyebrows.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:polly.toynbee@theguardian.com\">polly.toynbee@theguardian.com</a></p>",

  "<p>The painter Manuel Kaminski is an invention of Daniel Kehlmann, best known outside his native Germany for the ingenious bestseller Measuring the World. He's a plausible late survivor of the golden age of modernism - fitfully famous during his long life and now living in seclusion. Sebastian Zollner, a klutzy journalist, has decided to write his biography - not because he has an especial interest in Kaminski's work, but because he's hard-up, seedily ambitious, locked in competition with the better-qualified art critic Hans Bahring, and knows that the other two elderly painter-superstars he has in his sights (Balthus and Lucian Freud) are already spoken for. Kaminski and Zollner start Kehlmann's witty, shrewd and smartly translated novel as almost-opposites, and end up realising they have a remarkable amount in common.</p> <p>When we first encounter Zollner he is absurdly at odds with the world and himself - in the throes of breaking up with his girlfriend Elke, imperviously tactless, a figure of mockery whose will to persist depends on a gigantic talent for self-deception. Kaminski is hardly in the world at all: geographically obscure, fiercely protected by his daughter Miriam, apparently almost blind, and loth to speak except in riddles or allusions. This means we need some guidance in order to estimate Kaminski's worth and history. Kehlmann provides this by arranging for Zollner to riffle through an art book - a predictable device, but made lively here by Zollner's hamfistedly dunking the thing in his bath.</p> <p>Although Miriam does her best to keep Zollner at bay, he stubbornly wears down her resistance by gate-crashing meals in Kaminski's house, and persuading himself that once the old boy is dead and the biography published, he and Miriam will set up together and \"administer the estate, maybe set up a museum\". It's a preposterous idea - as ludicrous in its way as the mutually cancelling views of art critics he interviews for background to his book - but Zollner has all the sensitivity of a charging rhinoceros, and will not be deflected. </p> <p>When he discovers that Kaminski's great love Therese, long assumed to be dead, is in fact alive, he becomes even more determined. Deciding that the commercial value of his book will be greatly increased if Kaminski were to meet her again, he bundles him into Miriam's car, and sets off for a reunion. This means, among other things, that Kehlmann switches his attention from art-jape to road-novel, which produces a broader kind of comedy in everything that follows. It doesn't matter. He is too quick-witted, and too alive to the ironies of the situation he has created, to let tensions slacken. As author and subject leave the house to begin their journey, Zollner reflects: \"I wouldn't have been able to say any more which of us was leading the other.\"</p> <p>The ambiguities quickly multiply. For one thing, Zollner finds it increasingly difficult to decide whether Kaminski's few utterances are pearls of wisdom, senile ramblings, or knowing teases. The same uncertainties surround his reminiscences of famous former friends, among them Matisse and Picasso. Practical problems deepen, too. They give a lift to a loopy hitchhiker, who promptly steals their car and luggage. When they check into a hotel, or require meals, Kaminski refuses to pay (Zollner's credit card soon bursts through its limit). Kaminski's real insights are routinely delivered to someone other than Zollner. In other words, the entire trip is a compressed history of disasters - with the result that Zollner loses layer after layer of his constructed self until he neither knows what to make of his own life, or of biography as a whole. \"Nobody,\" he says in exasperation, \"has any idea what they really look like, we have completely false pictures of ourselves.\"</p> <p>Shortly before reaching Therese, the two travellers let themselves into the empty flat of Zollner's former girlfriend Elke, from which they attend a gallery and encounter a posse of cartoonishly ignorant art-dealers. It's another means of reminding us that the journey now has as much to do with tracking Zollner's past as discovering Kaminski's. </p> <p>When at last they get to Therese, Kaminski is genuinely confused and moved, not least because it immediately becomes evident that while he has always looked on her as his great missed opportunity, she never thought along the same lines. She got over him and married someone else. She knew he'd become famous, but didn't care. Now she lives with someone whose banal interruptions (\"What annoys me are those pictures where you can't recognise anything\") prevent Kaminski saying anything of interest. From his own point of view, the reunion has been pointlessly distressing. For Zollner, it has been a bankrupting waste of time.</p> <p>Except that he has learned something about himself. In the melancholy comedy of the final pages, in which Miriam finally catches up with the two travellers and makes Zollner confront his unkindness, as well as the depth of his self-deception and uselessness, Zollner eventually discovers how close he has come to his subject. They are both men who have lost almost everything, and whose final act of self-possession is to reject what little remains to them. It's a bleak conclusion - but, in the steely comedy of Kehlmann's narrative, one that feels cathartic almost to the extent of seeming delightful.</p> <p>\u2022 Andrew Motion's Ways of Life: On Places, Painters and Poets is published by Faber.

  "<p>Music spills out on to the stone-flagged streets of Perugia from neon-lit pubs and clubs where newly enrolled students at the town's universities are downing cheap shots. One year on from the murder of Meredith Kercher, the headlines generated by the tragedy have - for some - given the hilltop town a certain cachet.</p> <p>\"Lots of parents got scared by the murder,\" said Elisa Calo, 23, an Italian student from southern Italy who had driven up to meet friends. \"But their children read the articles about Perugia being the Ibiza of Italy and were more determined than ever to enrol at the university.\"</p> <p>But for those who were studying alongside Kercher, and lived through the disturbing days of last November in Perugia, the reaction was enduring fear rather than titillation.</p> <p>\"After Meredith died many students, including foreigners, put in requests to move from their rented apartments into halls of residence,\" said Prof Maurizio Olivieri, who organises student welfare programmes. \"I don't know if it is connected to the murder, but our team of psychologists has also had thousands more requests for appointments this year from students.\"</p> <p>\"A good few students went home early for Christmas after Meredith's death and didn't come back,\" said one local living off Corso Garibaldi, which is packed with student flats. \"The rumble of suitcases on the street as they left went on for days.\"</p> <p>The murder also formed part of a string of crimes against women in the area. Three women have been murdered in the province of Perugia this year, said Monica Napoleoni, head of the city's murder squad, while in a national survey last year, 6.4% of women in the region of Umbria reported being attacked or sexually assaulted in the previous 12 months, higher than the 5.4% national average.</p> <p>This week, Ivory Coast-born drifter Rudy Guede was sentenced to 30 years for the sexual assault and murder of Kercher, while her housemate, American student Amanda Knox, and Knox's Italian boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, will stand trial in December.</p> <p>As they wait in jail for their day in court, Perugia is again full of students. Enrolment this term at the city's main university remains \"more or less\" the same as last year's 34,000, said chancellor Prof Francesco Bistoni. Monthly enrolments at Perugia's University for Foreigners, where Knox and Kercher both studied Italian, totalled 5,540 by the end of last year, up by 4% on the previous year, and could rise again if the university's promotional work in China pays off.</p> <p>New students are flocking to the Merlin, which 12 months ago hosted the Halloween party where Kercher was famously photographed in a vampire outfit, her last night on the town before she was brutally stabbed the following evening.</p> <p>\"The foreign student numbers this autumn have boomed,\" said co-owner Pasquale Alessi, after politely telling two plastered American students to head home. \"We keep an eye on drunks but many bars are again battling for business, charging \u20ac10 (\u00a37) for all you can drink.\"</p> <p>Student spending power is also appreciated by Perugia's army of drug dealers, who have turned the town into central Italy's biggest cocaine, heroin and marijiuana outlet, even recruiting well-to-do students as pushers.</p> <p>Sollecito and Knox claimed their memories of the night of the murder were blurred by the large quantity of marijuana they had smoked, while Guede is depicted by witnesses as a cocaine user, although that is denied by his lawyer. </p> <p>Giacomo Silenzi, the downstairs neighbour Kercher was dating, had a collection of marijuana plants, while the car park across the street from the house Kercher and Knox shared was a favourite hang-out for dealers.</p> <p>Perugia may boast stunning views across the Umbrian hills and a world-class jazz festival held in frescoed palazzi, but it also has the highest number of overdose deaths per capita in Italy, as addicts move to be where the wholesalers are. North African dealers lurk on corners in the city centre and Nigerians control the suburbs, all under the watchful eye of the Calabrian 'Ndrangheta mafia.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the University of Foreigners said students were invited to films and poetry readings to help them integrate, but added: \"We don't talk to them about drugs.\"</p> <p>At the Merlin, British student Emma Guttridge, who arrived six weeks ago, said she had not noticed dealers and was happy to walk home to her flat on Corso Garibaldi alone in the middle of the night.</p> <p>\"Meredith Kercher was killed two days after I applied to come and study here, but I stuck with it and have no regrets,\" said Guttridge, 20. \"I come from Nottingham, which, after all, is not exactly paradise.\"</p>",
  "<p>A surveillance officer who was tailing Jean Charles de Menezes told the inquest into his death that his team had not positively identified him as a suspect before he was shot dead at Stockwell underground station, south London. </p> <p>The inquest had previously been told by a firearms officer who shot De Menezes that a surveillance officer had made a positive identification of the Brazilian as one of the would-be suicide bombers.</p> <p>The officer, identified only as Ken, told the inquest that he had tried and failed to get a clear sight of the man's face before he boarded a bus that would take him to Stockwell underground station. He said that his team leader had been asked by the police control room to give a \"percentage\" of how likely it was that the man they were tailing was the suspect suicide bomber they had been tracking. </p> <p>\"I believe he said that it was impossible to do that but 'for what it's worth, I think it's him',\" said Ken. He had followed De Menezes into the underground station, down the escalators and on to a train.</p> <p>He described how he indicated De Menezes to a team of armed officers who then entered the train. Ken also told the inquest that armed officers had shouted a warning of \"armed police\" loud enough for the young Brazilian to have heard the warning before he was shot. </p> <p>The court heard earlier this week from commuters who were in the same carriage that they heard no warning from the officers before the fatal shots were fired. </p> <p>Michael Mansfield QC, who is representing the De Menezes family, told the officer: \"The kernel of it is the possibility that a communication from your car about the level of identification has led to SO19 (the firearms team) being sent in.\" </p> <p>Mansfield said that Ken might have guessed that the reason the team was being asked to give \"a percentage\" on the likelihood of De Menezes being the suspect was in order to assess whether to send in the specialist firearms unit.</p> <p>\"Was anything said to the effect of 'this is definitely our man\"?\" asked Mansfield.</p> <p>\"No sir,\" replied Ken. </p> <p>He agreed that the man he had been following was not nervous or twitchy nor was he wearing any unusual clothing that would give cause for suspicion.</p> <p>However, Ken told the inquest that, as De Menezes jumped up from his seat in the carriage as the officers approached him he seemed to do so in an \"unusual\" manner. He said that De Menezes appeared to be holding his hands out in front of him at the level of his torso instead of using his arms to push himself out of the seat. </p> <p>Mansfield also asked Ken if his version of events was coloured by the knowledge that an innocent man had died. \"Has your account been influenced by the fact that you more or less ushered firearms officers towards a target who turned out to be innocent and you have to justify that?\" </p> <p>Ken denied that his account had been influenced at all by anybody. \"I wrote my account as best I remembered it,\" he told the inquest which resumes on Monday.</p>",
  "<p>Bake McKurty was no stranger to the parasitic mixings of art and commerce, literature and the rich. \"Hedge funds and haiku!\" he'd exclaimed to his wife, Suzy - and yet such mixings seemed never to lose their swift, stark capacity to appal. The hustle for money met the hustle for virtue and everyone washed their hands in one another. It was a common enough thing, though was there ever enough soap to cut the grease? \"That's what your lemon is for,\" Suzy would say, pointing at the twist in the martini he was not supposed to drink. Still, now and again, looking up between the crabmeat cocktail and the palate-cleansing sorbet sprinkled with fennel-pollen dust, he felt shocked by the whole thing.</p> <p>\"It's symbiosis,\" said Suzy as they were getting dressed to go. \"Think of it being like the krill that grooms and sees for the rock shrimp. Or that bird who picks out the bugs from the rhino hide.\"</p> <p>\"So we're the seeing-eye krill,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Yes!\"</p> <p>\"We're the oxpeckers.\"</p> <p>\"Well, I wasn't going to say that,\" she said.</p> <p>\"A lot in this world has to do with bugs,\" said Bake.</p> <p>\"Food,\" she said. \"A lot has to do with grooming and food. Are you wearing that?\"</p> <p>\"What's wrong with it?\"</p> <p>\"Lose the - what are those?\"</p> <p>\"Suspenders\"</p> <p>\"They're red.\"</p> <p>\"OK, OK. But you know, I never do that to you.\"</p> <p>\"I'm the sighted krill,\" she said. She smoothed his hair, which had recently become a weird pom-pom of silver and maize.</p> <p>\"And I'm the blind boy?\"</p> <p>\"Well, I wasn't going to say that either.\"</p> <p>\"You look good. Whatever it is you're wearing. See? I say nice things to you!\"</p> <p>\"It's a sarong.\" She tugged it up a little. </p> <p>He ripped off the suspenders. \"Well, here. You may need these.\"</p> <p>They were staying at a Georgetown B&amp;B to save a little money, a townhouse where the owner-couple left warm cookies at everyone's door at night to compensate for their loud toddler who by 6am was barking orders and pointing at her mother to fetch this toy or that. After a day of sightseeing (all those museums pre-paid with income taxes; it was like being philanthropists come to investigate the look of their own money) Suzy and Bake were already tired. They had come back early for a pre-dinner lie-down. \"Tea and crumpets,\" suggested Bake. </p> <p>\"Crumpets?\" Propped up on the bed with one hand, Suzy had given him a look of cartoon seduction, one leg sprung shakily into the air. </p> <p>\"Grumpets,\" said Bake \"I'm too old for crumpets.\" All affection and attraction led to vaudeville, if not to Rome. When they were ready to leave for the evening, they hailed a cab and recited the fundraiser's address to the cabbie who nodded and said ominously: \"Oh, yes.\"</p> <p>Never mind good taste, here at this gala even the usual diaphanous veneer of seemliness had been tossed to the tradewinds. Voodoo economics had become doodoo economics, noted Bake. The fundraiser for Lunar Lines Literary Journal - 3LJ as it was known to its readers and contributors, \"the magazine\" as it was known to its staff, as if there were no others - was being held in a bank. Or at least a former bank, one which had recently gone under, and which now sold squid-ink orchietti beneath its vaulted ceilings, and martinis and granache from its former teller stations. Wood and marble were preserved and buffed, glass barriers removed. In the evening light the place was golden. It was cute! So what if subtle boundaries of occasion and transaction had been given up on? So what if this were a mausoleum of greed now danced in by all. He and Suzy had been invited. The passive voice could always be used to obscure blame. </p> <p>His invitation, however, to this DC fundraiser seemed to Bake a bit of a fluke, since Man on a Quarter, Man on a Horse, Bake's ill-selling biography of George Washington (in a year where everyone was obsessed with Lincoln, even the efficiently conflated Presidents' day had failed to help his book sales) would appear to fit him to neither category of guest. But Lunar Lines, whose offices were in Washington, had excerpted a portion of it, as if in celebration of their town. And so Bake was sent two free dinner tickets. He would have to rub elbows and charm the other guests - the rich, the magazine's donors who would be paying $500 a plate. Could he manage that? Could he be the court jester, the town clown, the token writer at the table? \"Absolutely,\" he lied. </p> <p>Why had he come? Though it was named after the man he had devoted years of affectionate thought and research to, he had never liked this city. An ostentatious company town built on a marsh - a mammoth, pompous chit-ridden motor vehicle department run by gladiators. High-level clerks on the take, their heads full of unsound sound bites and falsified recall. \"Yes! How are you? It's been a while?\" Not even \"it's been a long time\" because who knew? Perhaps it hadn't been. Better just to say, neutrally, \"It's been a while,\" and no one could argue. </p> <p>He clung to Suzy. \"At least the wine is good,\" she said. They weren't really mingling. They were doing something that was more like a stiff list, a drift and sway. The acoustics made it impossible to speak normally and so they found themselves shouting inanities then just falling mute. The noise of the place was deafening as a sea, and the booming heartiness of others seemed to destroy all possibility of happiness for themselves.</p> <p>\"Soon we'll have to find our table,\" he shouted, glancing out at the vast room filled with a hundred white-clothed circles, flickering with candlelight. Small vases of heather sprigs that could easily catch fire had been placed in the centre as well. So were little chrome cardholders declaring the table numbers. \"What number are we?\"</p> <p>Suzy pulled the tag from what he facetiously called her \"darling little bag\" then shoved it back in. \"Seventy-nine,\" she said. \"I hope that's near the restroom.\" </p> <p>\"I hope it's near the exit.\"</p> <p>\"Let's make a dash for it now!\"</p> <p>\"Let's scream 'fire!'\"</p> <p>\"Let's fake heart attacks!\"</p> <p>\"Do you have any pot?\"</p> <p>\"We flew here - remember? I wouldn't bring pot on an airplane.\"</p> <p>\"We're losing our sense of adventure. In all things.\"</p> <p>\"This is an adventure!\"</p> <p>\"You see, that's what I mean.\"</p> <p>At the ringing of a small bell everyone began to sit - not just the ones in wheelchairs, whom he had begun to envy. Bake let Suzy lead as they wended their way, drinks in hand, between the dozens of tables that were between them and number 79. They were the first ones there, and when he looked at the place cards and saw that someone had placed Suzy far away from him, he quickly switched the seating arrangements and placed her next to him, on his left. \"I didn't come this far not to sit next to you,\" he said, and she smiled wanly, squeezing his upper arm. These kinds of gestures were necessary, since they had not had sex in six months. \"I'm 60 and I'm on anti-depressants,\" said Bake, when Suzy had once (why only once?) complained. \"I'm lucky my penis hasn't dropped off.\" </p> <p>They remained standing by their seats, waiting for their table to fill up: soon a young investor couple from Wall Street who had not yet lost their jobs; then a sculptor and her son; then an editorial assistant from 3LJ. Then lastly, to claim the seat to his right, a brisk young Asian woman in tapping heels. She thrust her hand out to greet him. Her nails were long and painted white - perhaps they were fake: Suzy would know, though Suzy was now sitting down and talking to the sculptor next to her. </p> <p>\"I'm Linda Santo,\" the woman to his right said, smiling. Her hair was black and shiny and long enough so that with a toss of the head she could swing it back behind her shoulder and short enough that it would fall quickly forward again. She was wearing a navy-blue satin dress and a string of pearls. The red shawl she had wrapped over her shoulders she now placed on the back of her seat. He felt a small stirring in him. He had always been attracted to Asian women, though he knew he mustn't ever mention this to Suzy, or to anyone really.</p> <p>\"I'm Baker McKurty,\" he said, shaking her hand.</p> <p>\"Baker?\" she repeated.</p> <p>\"I usually go by 'Bake'.\" He accidentally gave her a wink. One had to be very stable to wink at a person and not frighten them.</p> <p>\"Bake?\" She looked a little horrified - if one could be horrified only a little. She was somehow aghast - and so he pulled out her chair to show her that he was harmless. No sooner were they all seated than appetisers zoomed in. Tomatoes stuffed with avocados and avocados with tomatoes. It was a witticism - with a Christmassy look, though Christmas was a long way away.</p> <p>\"So where are all the writers?\" Linda Santo asked him while looking over both her shoulders. The shiny hair flew. \"I was told there would be writers here.\"</p> <p>\"You're not a writer?\"</p> <p>\"No, I'm an evil lobbyist,\" she said, grinning slightly. \"Are you a writer?\"</p> <p>\"In a manner of speaking, I suppose,\" he said.</p> <p>\"You are?\" She brightened. \"What might you have written?\"</p> <p>\"What might I have written? Or, what did I actually write?\"</p> <p>\"Either one.\"</p> <p>He cleared his throat. \"I've written several biographies. Boy George. King George. And now George Washington. That's my most recent. A biography of George Washington. A captivating man, really, with a tremendous knack for real estate. And a peevishness about being overlooked for promotion when he served in the British army. The things that will start a war! And I'm not like his other biographers. I don't rule out his being gay.\"</p> <p>\"You're a biographer of Georges,\" she said, nodding and unmoved. Clearly she'd been hoping for Don DeLillo.</p> <p>This provoked him. He veered off into a demented heat. \"Actually, I've won the Nobel prize.\" </p> <p>\"Really?\"</p> <p>\"Yes! But, well, I won it during a year when the media weren't paying a lot of attention. So it kind of got lost in the shuffle. I won . . . right after 9/11. In the shadow of 9/11. Actually, I won right as the second tower was being hit.\"</p> <p>She scowled. \"The Nobel prize for literature?\" </p> <p>\"Oh, for literature? No, no, no - not for literature.\" His penis now sat soft as a shrinking peach in his pants. </p> <p>Suzy leaned in on his left and spoke across Bake's plate to Linda. \"Is he bothering you? If he bothers you, just let me know. I'm Suzy.\" She pulled her hand out of her lap and the two women shook hands over his avocado. He could see Linda's nails were fake. Or, if not fake, something. They resembled talons. </p> <p>\"This is Linda,\" said Bake. \"She's an evil lobbyist.\"</p> <p>\"Really!\" Suzy said good-naturedly, but soon the sculptor was tapping her on the arm and she had to turn back and be introduced to the sculptor's son.</p> <p>\"Is it hard being a lobbyist?\"</p> <p>\"It's interesting,\" she said. \"It's hard work but interesting.\"</p> <p>\"That's the best kind.\"</p> <p>\"Where are you from?\"</p> <p>\"Chicago.\"</p> <p>\"Oh, really,\" she said, as if he had announced his close connection to Al Capone. Anyone he ever mentioned Chicago to always brought up Capone. Either Capone or the Cubs.</p> <p>\"So you know the presidential candidate for the Democrats?\"</p> <p>\"Brocko? Love him! He's the great new thing. Honest. Practical. One of us! He's a writer himself. I wonder if he's here.\" Now Bake, as if in mimicry, turned and looked over both his shoulders.</p> <p>\"He's probably out with his terrorist friends.\"</p> <p>\"He has terrorist friends?\" Bake himself had a terrorist friend. Midwesterners loved their terrorist friends - who were usually balding, boring citizens still mythically dining out on the sins of their long ago youth. They never actually killed anyone - at least not intentionally. They aged and fattened in the ordinary fashion. They were rehabilitated. They served their time. And if they didn't, because of infuriating class privilege that allowed them to just go on as if nothing had ever happened, well, they raised each other's children and got advanced degrees and gave back to society in other ways. He supposed. He didn't really know much about Chicago. He was actually from Michigan, but when going anywhere he always flew out of O'Hare.</p> <p>\"Uh, yeah. That bomber who tried to blow up federal buildings right here in this town.\" </p> <p>\"When Brocko was a kid? That sixties guy? But Brocko doesn't even like the sixties. He thinks they're so . . . sixties. The sixties took his mother on some wild ride away from him.\"</p> <p>\"The sixties made him, my friend.\"</p> <p>Bake looked at her more closely. Now he could see she wasn't Asian. She had simply had some kind of plastic surgery: skin was stretched and draped strangely around her eyes. A botched eye job. A bad face lift. An acid peel. Whatever it was: Suzy would know exactly. </p> <p>\"Well, he was a young child.\"</p> <p>\"So he says.\"</p> <p>\"Is there some dispute about his age?\"</p> <p>\"Where is his birth certificate?\"</p> <p>\"I have no idea,\" said Bake. \"I have no idea where my own is.\"</p> <p>\"Here is my real problem: this country was founded by and continues to be held together by people who have worked very hard to get where they are.\" Bake shrugged and wagged his head around. Could he speak of people having things they didn't deserve, in a roomful of such people? Now would not be the time to speak of timing. It would be unlucky to speak of luck. She continued. \"And if you don't understand that, my friend, then we cannot continue this conversation.\"</p> <p>The sudden way in which the whole possibility of communication was now on the line startled him. \"I see you've researched the founding of this country.\" He would look for common ground.</p> <p>\"I watched John Adams on HBO. Every single episode.\" </p> <p>\"Wasn't the guy who played George Washington uncanny? I did think Jefferson looked distractingly like Martin Amis. I wonder if Martin is here?\" He looked over his shoulders again. He needed Martin Amis to get over here right now and help him.</p> <p>Linda looked at him fiercely. \"It was a great mini-series and a great reminder of the founding principles of our nation.\"</p> <p>\"Did you know George Washington was afraid of being buried alive?\"</p> <p>\"I didn't know about that.\"</p> <p>\"The guy scarcely had a fear except for that one. You knew he freed his slaves?\"</p> <p>\"Hmmmm.\" </p> <p>She was eating; he was not. This would not work to his advantage. Nonetheless he went on. \"Talk about people who've toiled hard in this country - and yet, not to argue with your thesis too much, those slaves didn't all get ahead.\"</p> <p>\"Your man Barama, my friend, would not even be in the running if he wasn't black.\"</p> <p>Now all appetite left him entirely. The food on his plate, whatever it was, splotches of taupe, dollops of orange, went abstract like a painting. His blood pressure flew up; he could feel the pulsing twitch in his temple. \"You know, I never thought about it before but you're right! Being black really is the fastest, easiest way to get to the White House!\"</p> <p>She said nothing, and so he added: \"Unless you're going by cab, and then, well, it can slow you down a little.\" </p> <p>Chewing, Linda looked at him, a flash in her eyes. She swallowed. \"Well, supposedly we've already had a black president.\"</p> <p>\"We have?\"</p> <p>\"Yes! A Nobel prize-winning author said so!\"</p> <p>\"Hey. Take it firsthand from me: don't believe everything that a Nobel prizewinner tells you. I don't think a black president ever gets to become president when his nightclub-singer mistress is holding press conferences during the campaign. That would be - a white president. Please pass the salt.\"</p> <p>The shaker appeared before him. He shook some salt around on his plate and stared at it. </p> <p>Now Linda made a stern, effortful smile, struggling to cut something with her knife. Was it meat? Was it poultry? It was consoling to think that, for a change, the rich had had to pay a pretty penny for their chicken while his was free. But it was not consoling enough. \"If you don't think I as a woman know a thing or two about prejudice, you would be sadly mistaken,\" Linda said.</p> <p>\"Hey, it's not that easy being a man, either,\" said Bake. \"There's all that cash you have to spend on porno? And believe me, that's money you never get back.\"</p> <p>He then retreated, turned toward his left, toward Suzy, and leaned in. \"Help me,\" he whispered in her ear.</p> <p>\"Are you charming the patrons?\"</p> <p>\"I fear some object may be thrown.\"</p> <p>\"You're supposed to charm the patrons.\"</p> <p>\"I know, I know, I was trying to. I swear. But she's one of those who keeps referring to Brocko as 'Barama'.\" He had violated most of Suzy's dinner-talk rules already: no politics, no religion, no portfolio tips. And unless you see the head crowning, never look at a woman's stomach and ask if she's pregnant. He had learned all these the hard way. </p> <p>But in a year like this one, there was no staying away from certain topics.</p> <p>\"Get back there,\" Suzy said. The sculptor was tapping Suzy on the arm again.</p> <p>He tried once more with Linda Santo the evil lobbyist. \"Here's the way I see it - and this I think you'll appreciate. It would be great at long last to have a president in the White House whose last name ends with a vowel.\"</p> <p>\"We've never had a president whose last name ended with a vowel?\"</p> <p>\"Well, I don't count Coolidge.\"</p> <p>\"You're from what part of Chicago?\"</p> <p>\"Well, just outside Chicago.\"</p> <p>\"Where outside?\"</p> <p>\"Michigan.\"</p> <p>\"Isn't Michigan a long way from Chicago?\"</p> <p>\"It is!\" He could feel the cool air on the skin between his socks and his pantcuffs. When he looked at her hands, they seemed frozen into claws.</p> <p>\"People talk about the rock-solid sweetness of the heartland, but I have to say: Chicago seems like a city that has taken too much pride in its own criminal activity.\" She smiled grimly. </p> <p>\"I don't think that's true.\" Or was it? He was trying to give her a chance. What if she was right? \"Perhaps we have an unfulfilled streak of myth-making. Or perhaps we just don't live as fearfully as people do elsewhere,\" he said. Now he was just guessing.</p> <p>\"You wait, my friend, there are some diabolical people eyeing that Sears Tower as we speak.\"</p> <p>Now he was silent.</p> <p>\"And if you're in it when it happens, which I hope you're not, but if you are, if you are, if you are, if you're eating lunch at the top or having a meeting down below or whatever it is you may be doing, you will be changed. Because I've been there. I know what it's like to be bombed by terrorists - I was in the Pentagon when they crashed that plane right down into it and I'll tell you: I was burned alive but not dead. I was burned alive. It lit me inside. Because of that I know more than ever what this country is about, my friend.\"</p> <p>He saw now that her fingernails really were plastic, that the hand really was a dry frozen claw, that the face that had seemed intriguingly exotic had actually been scarred by fire and only partially repaired. He saw how she was cloaked in a courageous and intense hideosity. The hair was beautiful but now he imagined it was probably a wig. Pity poured through him: he'd never before felt so sorry for someone. How could someone have suffered so much? How could someone have come so close to death, so unfairly, so painfully and heroically, and how could he still want to strangle them? </p> <p>\"You were a lobbyist for the Pentagon?\" was all he managed to say.</p> <p>\"Any faux pas?\" asked Suzy in the cab on the way back to the B&amp;B, where warm cookies would await them by their door, tea packets in the bath, their own snore strips on the nightstand.</p> <p>\"Beaucoup faux,\" said Bake. He pronounced it foze. \"Beaucoup verboten foze. Uttering my very name was like standing on the table and peeing in a wineglass.\"</p> <p>\"What? Oh, please.\"</p> <p>\"I'm afraid I spoke about politics. I couldn't control myself.\" </p> <p>\"Brocko is going to win. All will be well. Rest assured,\" she said, as the cab sped along toward Georgetown, the street kerbs rusted and rouged with the first fallen leaves.</p> <p>\"Promise?\"</p> <p>\"Promise.\" </p> <p>He was afraid to say more. He did not know how much time he and Suzy might even have left together, and an end game of geriatric speed-dating - everyone deaf and looking identical: \"What? I can't hear you? What? You again? Didn't I just see you?\" - all taking place amid bankruptcy and war might be the real circle of hell he was destined for.</p> <p>\"Don't ever leave me,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Why on earth would I do that?\" </p> <p>He paused. \"I'm putting in a request not just for on earth, but for even after that.\"</p> <p>\"OK,\" she said, and squeezed his meaty thigh. At least he had once liked to think of it as meaty. She held her hand there and on top of hers he placed his, the one with the wedding ring she had given him, identical to her own. He willed all his love into his hand and watched as it clasped hers, studied the firm, deliberate hydraulics of its knuckles and joints. But she had already turned her head away and was looking out of the window, the whole ride back showing him only her beautiful hair, which was lit up like gold by the passing streetlamps, as if it were something not attached to her at all.</p> <p>\u00a9 Lorrie Moore</p>",

Levitt and Dubner's Freakonomics is such a book; its theses may seem beguiling now, but our beguilement is unlikely to stand the test of time, especially as other males will emerge from the undergrowth to engage with the top honchos whose roaring has so far filled the glen, and will replace them in their turn. Brandishing the \"big idea\" is a bookish version of male display, and as such a product of the same mindset as that behind the manuscripts that litter my desk. To explain is in some sense to control. Proselytising has always been a male preserve.</p> <p>I would hope that fewer women have so far featured in the big ideas landscape because, by and large, they are more interested in understanding than explaining, in describing rather than accounting for. Giving credence to a big idea is a way of permitting ourselves to skirt strenuous engagement with the enigma that is our life. </p> <p>As a domesticated sex, women have been forced to inhabit a world of actualities rather than a world of ideas. For centuries menfolk could gather in tea-rooms or pubs or common rooms or pavement caf\u00e9s to bandy opposing solutions to the riddle of existence, while women were cleaning their houses and getting food on the table.</p> <p>A century after women were admitted to higher education, they are still less confident than men about the merit of their insights and ideas. Women students tend to work too hard, as if they could not understand that the more you know the less well you are going to perform in a three-hour examination. Shovelling around a blizzard of factoids and references rather than zapping the examiner with an amazing idea is a safer way to go and, if it pulls a second rather than a first, the woman student will be satisfied. As a teacher a woman is likely to put too many hours into actual contact with students, and so neglect the empire-building that would take her up the career ladder to a professorial chair or an adequate research grant. We might lament the lack of ambition that underlies such choices, but we should also be aware that job satisfaction has to do with loving where you are and what you do, not tomorrow, now.</p> <p>The usual must-read explain-it-all book is out of print in two years. Really big ideas take longer. Many women have written and more will write big ideas books, but they probably won't flag them as such. Neither Rachel Carson nor her publishers could have told us how important Silent Spring would turn out to be. An idea can only become big when more and more people entertain it, understand it, and apply it. By then it will have busted out of the single book and taken on a multiplicity of forms. <br><strong>Germaine Greer</strong></p> <p>\u2022 It has been half-term, but I was not expecting the eager hordes when I visited the Imperial War Museum's exhibition on James Bond's creator. Ian Fleming's centenary has put him firmly back on the cultural map. Strange, then, that Quantum of Solace, the Bond film released this week, should bear no relation, bar the title, to Fleming's short story of that name. The title has a Hollywood portentousness, but the story - about a bitter matrimonial struggle in the colonies - is most unBond-like: no action; rather, a tropical mood piece in the style of Somerset Maugham.</p> <p>By 1959, Fleming had written seven well-received 007 novels. But he was not satisfied with his success. His books might be popular, but not with the people he wanted. The previous year, Paul Johnson in a New Statesman essay had described Dr No as \"without a doubt the nastiest book\" he had ever read. Closer to home, Ann, Fleming's high-born wife, could not disguise her distaste for Bond - a standing joke with literary friends such as Evelyn Waugh and Cyril Connolly. </p> <p>Every winter, Fleming would go for three months to Goldeneye, his house in Jamaica, where he knocked out the latest of his Bond stories. But in 1959 his fire had gone. Ann had refused to accompany him and, unable to concentrate on a full-scale novel, he attempted a book of short stories, published the following year as For Your Eyes Only. But even a quota of five mini-007 tales proved beyond him. So he turned to his girlfriend in Jamaica, Blanche Blackwell, for the real-life tale that became his story \"Quantum of Solace\". Blackwell revealed how, in 1938, she had visited her then husband, Joe Blackwell, in Mandeville, where he had been seconded to the local constabulary at the time of a rebellion that threatened to bring the colony to its knees. She had been appalled to witness one of his fellow officers being humiliated by his wife's very public extramarital affair.</p> <p>She had been reminded of these events when her friend, Sylvia Foot, the wife of a recent governor general, asked her to help an unfortunate woman who had been abandoned by her husband, a former deputy police commissioner on the island. This was Elspeth Smith, the brazen adulteress of Mandeville. According to Foot, the police officer, Clive Smith, had become deputy commissioner in Jamaica. But his wife's infidelities rankled. After a trip abroad, he told her he would no longer communicate, except in writing. When, a year later, she asked for a divorce and alimony, he informed her she would be financially secure since she had the house, the car and all the furnishings. Soon afterwards, he moved to Barbados as commissioner of police. When Elspeth Smith came to sell up, she found nothing paid for. Thus Foot's appeal for charity. But Blackwell, recalling Elspeth's behaviour in 1938, felt no inclination to help. </p> <p>Fleming changed the Smiths' home to Bermuda and made the policeman a diplomat, but kept the gist of the story, which in his version was told to Bond in an after-dinner conversation in Nassau about the nature of marriage. He had the narrator, the governor of the Bahamas, defining the Quantum of Solace as a precise equation of the amount of comfort necessary between two people if love is to flourish. If this figure is zero, there can be no love. Bond clearly understood, for he added that \"when the other person not only makes you feel insecure but actually seems to want to destroy you ... you've got to get away to save yourself\".</p> <p>In taking this line, Fleming was commenting on his own parlous marriage. The new film makes some small obeisance to this idea by insisting that Bond is inspired by a residual sense of love to find the killers of Vesper Lynd, his girlfriend in his previous cinematic outing, Casino Royale</p> <p>Blackwell at least received recompense for her authorial help. Fleming acknowledged her role by giving her what he called \"a fat present\" - in reality a slim wristwatch from Cartier. At last, a true Bond touch.<br><strong>Andrew Lycett</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Katie Price apart, British authors have been slow to exploit their brands via merchandising - unlike their US counterparts. The website of crime writer James Lee Burke, for example, now offers fans a chance to identify with his gritty detective Dave Robicheaux by buying baseball caps ($17.50) and T-shirts ($18.95, no sizes below L available) promoting the fictive shop for anglers that the Louisiana cop runs when not sleuthing. </p> <p>Danielle Steel, meanwhile, has just got into perfume with Danielle, priced at around $40 and available exclusively at Boots.

  "<p><strong>How did you come to write a novel about the Pakistan of General Zia?</strong></p> <p>I remember the precise moment I decided to write the book - well, a book, anyway. I was sitting in my BBC office in London watching the footage of the Beslan school siege. There were all these classrooms wired with explosives, and schoolchildren huddled together, and parents frantic outside - and dozens of cameras broadcasting it live. I had been a journalist for a very long time and it occurred to me that no amount of balanced reporting, background or analysis can capture this despair. My book has nothing to do with Chechnya or schoolchildren, but this was the moment when I decided to write it. I only had a vague idea - that there is a story behind how our world became like this, where these horrors began. Obviously, when I started writing I forgot all about my motivation.</p> <p><strong>Was it your first attempt at writing?</strong></p> <p>I had done a lot of journalism before this book, had written a feature film, and a couple of stage plays in Urdu, one of which was later adapted for BBC radio. I had dabbled in Punjabi poetry, and also started a novel which had lovely long descriptions of summer afternoons in an unnamed village with rants by a horny teenager, and a horse going crazy - but not much of a plot. So this was my first attempt at telling a story with a beginning and an end.</p> <p><strong>What came first?</strong></p> <p>The voice of my main character, Ali Shigri, who is this privileged young man, brash, all-knowing, but actually quite clueless about the world. He is out for revenge but can't tell his friends from his enemies. He is in love but can't quite express it. Like your average young man, I suppose.</p> <p><strong>What were the hardest bits?</strong></p> <p>Reading what I had written. Staying with the idea. Not knowing if anyone cared about what I was writing. Not knowing where to end a paragraph. But I guess, like in life, the hardest bits turned out to be the most rewarding. The writing became better, or at least more fun for me, when I took a leap in the dark and went to places I didn't know. </p> <p><strong>How did you research the novel?</strong></p> <p>I read a lot of books about the period, by Pakistanis as well as Americans, and it was nothing but lies. There were books about General Zia written by his cronies in which he is this god-fearing humble man who brought about the end of the Soviet Union just by being god-fearing and humble. Then there were others written by CIA types which pontificated about how they brought about the end of communism by being dedicated and professional. So I stopped researching and made up my own bunch of lies. Then there were technical bits - flying sequences, drill scenes. Although I had done all that when I was in the air force, I had to resort to YouTube to refresh my memory.</p> <p><strong>How did it come to be published?</strong></p> <p>I sent it to a few agents who made encouraging noises but wanted me to tinker with this or that. One of them even promised to make me a millionaire if I could come up with a better title. And then Clare Alexander said all I needed to do was fix a few typos and it would be ready. I fixed the typos and she found me publishers in more than a dozen countries.</p> <p><strong>What are you most pleased with?</strong></p> <p>No publisher in Pakistan was ready to publish it because they thought it was too controversial. The Indian edition had to be imported into Pakistan, where I have had nothing but gushing reviews and very happy booksellers. I have even seen pirated copies, which is considered the ultimate compliment in Pakistan.</p> <p><strong>What would you do differently/better next time?</strong></p> <p>In the run up to my next publication I would implement a better skincare regime and think about my motivations, because the first time around I didn't know that they take your picture and expect you to say coherent things about your life and book. One of my close friends, who liked the book, said that it lacked a big message about the meaning of life. And I thought I was delivering one on every page. </p> <p><strong>Who were your literary models?</strong></p> <p>I am very impressionable and even now when I read a good paragraph my knees start trembling. During the last six weeks my literary models have gone from being Martin Amis to Junot D\u00edaz to Joseph Smith (The Wolf, read it and you'll know) and an Urdu writer, Asad Mohammed Khan. But my all-time favourite is Truman Capote, although I can't really model myself on him.

  "<p>The day we brought my new-born son home to our Brooklyn apartment, an article in the New York Times pointed out that \"a black male who drops out of high school [in the US] is 60 times more likely to find himself in prison than one with a bachelor's degree\". These are the kind of statistics I often quote in my work. But this time it was personal. Looking down at him as he snoozed in the brand new car seat, I thought: \"Those are not great odds. I'd better buy some more children's books.\"</p> <p>Over the next few weeks, as we fumbled with the nappies, pram, barfing and burping, a new, previously unthinkable option for black American males emerged: the presidency of the United States. Osceola was born on the weekend Barack Obama declared his candidacy. This prompted conversations that I would not have had otherwise. His success, I was told, would signify great things for my son. Osceola would grow up with an assumption that the highest office in the land was open to him. That the future could be his. That there was, I was told, nothing that this child could not achieve. </p> <p>Back in February 2007, when Obama announced his candidacy, this never made much sense to me. The fact that my son suddenly has a tiny theoretical chance of getting to the White House is less important than the more real chance of his ending up behind bars (one in three black American boys born in 2001 will do so) or dead (three black kids are shot every day). I wanted a president who could change the odds for the many rather than raise the stakes for a few. I didn't care what they looked like. It wasn't that I didn't understand the symbolic importance of his bid. I just did not want to mistake it for substance.</p> <p>On a political level, I have always thought he was interesting. Obama's announcement came 18 months after hurricane Katrina put black America's collective deprivation and individual success clearly on display. One man can rise to the presidency and a whole community can sink into the Gulf of Mexico: anything, I thought, really is possible. And with three days to go before election day, it looks like the US stands on the verge of making the historic decision to put a black man in the White House.</p> <p>This was no reflection on Obama. Everything I'd heard about him - not least his opposition to the Iraq war at a time when such a position was unpopular - was impressive. But his two years in the Senate suggested he was pretty mainstream and even, at times, a little suspect. He'd supported Joseph Lieberman (a Democrat who is now supporting John McCain) in his primary Senate campaign against an anti-war campaigner. And he voted to confirm Condoleezza Rice as secretary of state. It wasn't obvious to me that he would be any better than some other generic Democrat with different pigmentation. The idea that his presidency would mean anything for Osceola's life never really crossed my mind.</p> <p>To express such scepticism before many Obama supporters was to be accused of cynicism. The true believers do not just want you to drink the Kool Aid. They demand that you chug it.</p> <p>The people my scepticism vexed most were white liberals. Obama had become prey to the soft bigotry of unreasonable expectations. Describing the crowd's reaction to him in Rockford, Illinois, Time's Joe Klein noted: \"The African Americans tend to be fairly reserved ... The white people, by contrast, are out of control.\" They had found a black politician they felt comfortable with, and wanted him to be everything: Martin Luther King, John F Kennedy, a griot, president, vice-president, motherhood and apple pie. They prattled on about a post-racial America as though the Jena Six never happened and Sean Bell, a unarmed black man from Queens who was riddled with bullets on his wedding day, was still alive.</p> <p>My wife, who is African American, shared my reservations about Obama, but saw things differently. She remembers the thrill of being a young girl when the black Democrat Harold Washington was elected in her hometown, Chicago. She liked him because her parents liked him. She could see it was important, but she didn't know why.</p> <p>\"My dad grew up being told a black person couldn't be a pilot, and my son is growing up knowing that a black person can be president,\" she said. \"It's not that racism is gone, it's just that it's not about the idea that all black people are excluded on the basis of their race from any part of society or any particular job. That was the racism my parents grew up with and that is now one generation removed from Osceola.\" Her dad became a pilot, as did her brother.</p> <p>Of course, Obama isn't standing for Osceola's benefit - which is just as well, because if Osceola could vote he would most likely support Elmo for mayor of Sesame Street. But in a sense these projections lie at the heart of any thoughtful appraisal of the racial dynamics underpinning Obama's candidacy. The desire to believe we are in a paradigm-shifting moment must be set against the fact that not every historic first changes the course of history. Changing our understanding of what is possible doesn't, in itself, create new possibilities. </p> <p>I watched Obama accept the Democratic nomination with my mother-in-law, Janet, in a cinema on the southside of Chicago. Janet was raised in the South with the laws that put her at the back of the bus. As a teenager she went with her mother to see Martin Luther King speak in Philadelphia, listening in the overflow in the vestry because there were too many people in the church.</p> <p>She was the one who first told me about Obama in 2003. She got involved in his primary campaign for the Senate when he didn't have a prayer, after she'd seen him on the local public channel, when he was a state senator. \"He seemed like a bright guy,\" she says. \"He reasoned his way through things and was always very impressive.\" She particularly liked his stance on the war. When he said he was running for Senate, she signed up as a volunteer. </p> <p>And now, here we were just five years later seeing him clinch the deal in Denver on the big screen. At one point, when he recalled his anti-war speech in 2002, she punched my arm. \"I was there.\" As she drove me to my hotel, she would occasionally say to no one in particular: \"I just don't believe it.\"</p> <p>Whether Osceola would ever be able to relate to what a momentous time this is for Janet remains to be seen. But her response made me think that the late comedian George Carlin was wrong. Symbols are too important to be left to the symbol-minded. By that time, my thinking on Obama had evolved. Not so much because of the man, but the moment. The atmosphere during this campaign has been unlike anything I've ever seen in a western country. To see so many people - particularly young people - engaged and hopeful about their political future after eight depressing years is inspiring. The last time I saw it was in South Africa's first democratic elections in 1994.</p> <p>Walking down Sumter Street during Charleston's Martin Luther King day parade, watching white volunteers chant: \"Obama '08! We're ready. Why wait?\" gave political voice to an America I never doubted existed, but had yet to see. Among them was a young man who was \"so depressed\" after Obama's New Hampshire defeat that he had dropped everything he had been doing in Guatemala and flown back to help out. Local African Americans lined the sidewalks, cheering encouragement. Obama's victory in Iowa had proved that a black candidacy was not a pipe dream. </p> <p>It was a moment. Fleeting and maybe even fatuous. But nonetheless a political moment that produced hopeful human engagement. Within half an hour it had evaporated. The white volunteers went back to the office and black people went back to their homes in the poorest parts of town and waited for change. But that didn't mean it didn't happen or that it couldn't happen again. Nor was there anyone else who could make it happen.</p> <p>A couple months later came Obama's race speech in Philadelphia in response to the attacks on his pastor, Jeremiah Wright, in which he addressed black alienation and white disadvantage, set them both in a historical context, and then called on people to rise above it. It was a tall order. He pulled it off.</p> <p>That weekend, a friend invited us to brunch with a group of other black people to discuss the fallout. There were nine of us (10 if you include Osceola, who yanked a blind from the window). It was a typical boho (black bohemian) Brooklyn crowd of voluntary sector workers, teachers and the like. Most, like me, had been ambivalent about Obama at the outset. But his candidacy was becoming a vehicle for something bigger: a teachable moment about the potential of anti-racist discourse.</p> <p>A year before, Hillary Clinton's chief strategist, Mark Penn, laid out a plan of attack against Obama. \"All of these articles about his boyhood in Indonesia and his life in Hawaii are geared towards showing his background is diverse, multicultural and putting that in a new light. Save it for 2050. It also exposes a strong weakness for him - his roots to basic American values and culture are at best limited. I cannot imagine America electing a president during a time of war who is not at his centre fundamentally American in his thinking and in his values ... Let's explicitly own 'American' in our programmes, the speeches and the values. He doesn't ... Let's use our logo to make some flags we can give out. Let's add flag symbols to the backgrounds.\"</p> <p>Clinton rejected Penn's advice, but McCain pretty much adopted it. And at this point it appears to have failed. This time Republicans have misread white America's appetite for divisive racial rhetoric and overestimated its fear of the other. The fears and division are still there. But whatever the result on Tuesday, they are clearly no longer the decisive mobilising force they once were. </p> <p>If there is promise in here for my son, it is not so much that he is capable of doing anything he wants - I am his father and it's my responsibility to teach him that - but that white people won't necessarily stop him. What that does for his odds of finishing high school or going to jail remains to be seen. In the meantime, I'm off to the bookshop.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Go bouldering</strong> The most important element of climbing fitness is power endurance in the forearms, says Dave Binney, head coach of the British junior climbing team. \"Combined with good handgrip strength, this means you can climb for longer without fatigue. Bouldering, using short, high-intensity moves, is one of the best ways to develop this.\"</p> <p><strong>Update your kit</strong> Equipment improves all the time. \"For example, boots have stickier soles, and ropes and karabiners are much lighter,\" Binney says. \"It's worth investing in new stuff if yours is dated.\"</p> <p><strong>Get flexible</strong> Flexibility is vital for climbing economically. \"If you can't get a limb into a position where it puts least load on your hands, you'll tire fast. It has to be active flexibility, though - backed with the strength to get your limb into that position.\"</p> <p><strong>Fall off</strong> \"All climbers can be hampered by their head,\" Binney says. \"Fear affects your ability to hang on, then you overgrip and get tired. The key to combating fear is first to have 100% faith in your equipment and knots, so check them before ascent. Second, trust your belayer [the person holding the other end of the rope in case you fall] - practise leaning out at agreed points without looking down to check on them. Last, allow yourself to fall in a controlled situation - you'll see it's not as bad as you think.\"</p> <p><strong>Hatch a plan</strong> The best tip for a successful climb is to plan it. \"Step back and look at it - where the tricky parts are, where you can rest, what equipment you might need. And always climb with people who support and praise you. A competitive, self-interested group will ruin your confidence.\"</p>",

  "<p>It's so very poignant to see the American DVD release of John Milius's red-baiting 1980s classic Red Dawn happening in the present political climate. It makes you wonder whether the distributors thought they ought to get it out before the era it so neatly embodies is definitively flushed down history's toilet. Like Oliver Stone's W, it has a two-week window of opportunity to cash in before it becomes utterly irrelevant.</p> <p>Make no mistake, Red Dawn, which speculates darkly on what might happen if America were invaded by the Russians, is an important movie, perhaps the most important rightwing movie ever made in Hollywood. To a generation of overweight rightwing bloggers of the post-Star Wars generation \u2014 the Reagan babies who thought Alex Keaton was the hero of Family Ties, not a creepy yuppie dickhead and Ralph Reed-lookalike \u2014 Red Dawn is what The Battle Of Algiers was to late-60s leftwing radicals. It may not offer as plausible a blueprint for revolution as Pontecorvo's classic did for the Weather Underground or the Red Army Faction and countless more serious third world revolutionaries, but it offers something rightwing moviegoers rarely get to see: the consoling myth of people of a common political perspective and common values working together \u2014 beleaguered, outnumbered, always in mortal danger \u2014 to overthrow a sick leftwing dispensation and usher another, brighter, righter world into being. In their minds, these guys dream of being one of Patrick Swayze's teenage insurgents, the Wolverines from Red Dawn.</p> <p>It flatters the vanity of rightwingers in Hollywood that they are a tiny subversive force, kept out of the precincts of power by scheming liberal studio heads, black- or grey-listed, or enslaved as involuntary drones in a huge factory for subversive leftie propaganda. That they are, in short, victims.</p> <p>This mindset inflects two films that feature similar casts and are both classifiable as conservative movies. Swing Vote is a mild, rather dreary, political comedy in which Kevin Costner (a one-time GHW Bush contributor who has since recanted) plays a feckless Joe-the-plumber-type blue-collar bozo who ends up casting the lone vote that will decide who wins the presidential election. In the movie he's cynically courted by the candidates, Republican Kelsey Grammer and Democrat Dennis Hopper. Its politics are cuddly centre-right but those of An American Carol, from post-9/11 rightwing convert and Airplane writer David Zucker, are mean-spirited and hard-right, the ramblings of rich overdog creeps who see threats to their fortunes as threats to America. Naturally it received its premiere at last month's Republican convention.</p> <p>Grammer and Hopper both reappear in this miserably unfunny adaptation of A Christmas Carol \u2014 backed by $20m from the producer of The Passion Of The Christ \u2014 in which a truly vicious parody of Michael Moore (played by Chris Farley's brother Kevin \u2014 Tommy Boy must be rotating in his commodious casket), having mounted a campaign to abolish the fourth of July, is tormented by various \"spirits of America past\". The remainder of the cast is a who's-who of the contemporary scrag end of Hollywood's New Right. Grammer is the spirit of fascist-sympathiser George S Patton, while Jon Voight is George Washington. Voight has been busy on the campaign trail for John McCain this year and in July he shared with the Washington Times some sense of how dementedly far gone he now is in his politics. To wit: \"The Democrats have targeted young people, knowing how easy it is to bring forth whatever is needed to program their minds. I know this process well. I was caught up in the hysteria during the Vietnam era, which was brought about through Marxist propaganda underlying the so-called peace movement.\" (It goes on like that for 1,000 words.) Other righties like James Woods and Robert Davi have also lent what remains of their threadbare prestige to this excrement (the only absentee is sanctimonious war-hawk Ron Silver), and the result is as you'd expect. At the box office two weekends ago, it was one of many bad films crapped upon from a great height by Beverly Hills Chihuahua.</p> <p>This signal failure to appeal to any moviegoers at all was immediately excused with cries of fraud and conspiracy at the box offices of the nation's multiplexes. This notice appears on the movie's website: \"We have had heard from numerous people across the country that there has been some ticket fraud when buying a ticket for An American Carol this past weekend. Please check your ticket. If you were in fact one of those people that were 'mistakenly' sold a ticket for another movie please fill out the form below. Hold on to your ticket so we can have proof. Please email us a picture of your ticket stub to fraud@americancarol.com.\"</p> <p>Imagine that: the bored, spotty teenagers who hand out movie tickets all got together in a gigantic plot \u2014 one that would impress a hardened 9/11 conspiracy-paranoiac \u2014 to underplay the success of An American Carol!</p> <p>It is this sort of paranoia that really appeals to Hollywood's rightwingers. For years they have identified themselves as some oppressed minority of the truly good and true, like the persecuted early Christians or the French Resistance, working behind enemy lines with valour and honour (and all those other rightwing buzzwords), bathed in the Lord's good graces, as the hateful Lib'rul fascist elite forever grind their boot-heels in their faces.</p> <p>Coteries like the Wednesday Morning Club, founded by far-right gadfly David Horowitz to establish a conservative beachhead in the movie business, include on their guestlists such figures as Tom Selleck, Kurt Russell (a Libertarian, not a Republican), rightwing British transplant director Lionel Chetwynd (Hanoi Hilton), gameshow host Pat Sajak, writer-producer and Robert Zemeckis collaborator Bob Gale, and ex-Cheers writer Rob Long. With a secret army as motley as this, the revolution will be a very long time a-coming.</p> <p>It's the isolation that the beleaguered righties really savour: the opportunity to hang out with fellow egomaniacs of like political inclination, whine about how put-upon they all are, in their Bel Air mansions and palatial McBeach Houses, and to swell up in righteous indignation at the way the system keeps them down.</p> <p>More surprising are those disgusting traitors to the noble cause; people like Dennis Hopper who, to my surprise, turns out to have been a Republican for years (let's face it, he makes self-styled Republican Party Reptile PJ O'Rourke look like a teetotaller). He recently jumped ship with this surprising announcement: \"I voted for Bush, father and son, but this time I'll vote for Obama. I was the first person in my family to have been Republican. For most of my life I wasn't on the left. I pray God, Barack Obama is elected.\" No more Wednesday Morning Club meetings for Dennis, I fear, as the righties have been jumping all over him ever since.</p> <p>The truth is that Hollywood's a pragmatic town. If it's rightwing and it makes money, it'll be backed. If it's rightwing comedy that's not funny at all, chances are the studios will pass on it. If not, the audience will soon enough find you out, as happened spectacularly with Carol, and with This Just In, the cancelled rightwing rip-off of The Daily Show created by self-proclaimed \"rightwing nutjob\" Joel Surnow, who I haven't spotted on the welfare line lately.</p> <p>But this truth doesn't matter. What counts is that treasured sense of grievance and victimhood encapsulated in the words of Gods And Generals director, conservative Ronald Maxwell, interviewed at the rightwing Liberty Film Festival some years ago: \"The elites are using us. Never forget that we are the victims.\" Spoken like a true Wolverine. Now say goodnight, boys, your day is just about done.</p> <p>\u2022 An American Carol is heading straight to DVD, we presume</p>",

  "<p>BT shocked investors yesterday by warning on profits and ousting the head of its under-performing IT services operation in a move that sent shares in the telecoms company to their lowest since it was floated by the Thatcher government in 1984.</p> <p>Chief executive, Ian Livingston, who took over the helm four months ago, admitted that the performance of BT Global Services had been \"particularly disappointing\" and second quarter profits will miss City expectations as a result.</p> <p>Shareholders, meanwhile, were worried that the setback could force BT to slash its dividend, which is among the most attractive in the FTSE 100. BT had pledged to increase the payout this year, but after the company yesterday said its interim payment will be frozen at last year's level, shareholders reckon its final payment could be drastically reduced. </p> <p>The fear caused a dramatic fall in BT's shares price, which plunged under the 130p level at which the company listed more than 20 years ago. The 19% fall - the most dramatic in the company's history - wiped more than \u00a32bn off BT's value.</p> <p>BT said Fran\u00e7ois Barrault had resigned with immediate effect to be replaced as head of BT Global Services by Hanif Lalani, currently the company's finance director. Mr Barrault will receive almost \u20ac1m (\u00a3700,000) in compensation under his contract.</p> <p>Although BT Global Services has been successful in winning new business with major global customers such as Reuters and Unilever, costs have spiralled out of control under the 18-month leadership of the Frenchman. </p> <p>As a result, Lalani is expected to force through cost cutting which will lead to job losses among BT Global Services' worldwide workforce of 37,000. A BT spokesman refused to comment on the level of potential job losses but insiders fear hundreds could be axed.</p> <p>BT Global Services was set up more than five years ago to move the company into the lucrative market for IT services. It already accounts for a sizeable chunk of the group's revenues, but its profitability has consistently failed to live up to the City's expectations. In the first quarter of this year the unit made revenues of \u00a32.2bn - more than 40% of BT's total quarterly revenues - but its profit was just \u00a3239m, compared with group profits of over \u00a31.4bn. </p> <p>Two years ago the board set the business a \"medium term\" target of profit margins of 15%, but progress has been slow.</p> <p>Yesterday BT admitted that its margins will be in the range of 7% to 8% this year. Profits in the second quarter of this year will be down - at \u00a3120m.</p> <p>\"We acknowledge that the performance in this part of the group is unsatisfactory and are committed to taking decisive action to rectify the situation,\" said Livingston.</p> <p>The poor performance of BT Global Services - in contrast to the rest of the business which is performing in line with expectations - has shattered Livingston's forecasts for the company as a whole. In July he said BT would increase revenue, profits before financial charges and earnings per share this year. Now it only expects to increase revenues.</p>",
  "<p>Football is just too knee-jerk these days. We wait for years for someone to fill <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/england\">England's</a> \"problem\" left-wing position, then a fine young player comes along who can do the job for the next decade and as soon as he misplaces a couple of crosses the supporters start to boo. Not all of them, of course, but enough for Stewart Downing to admit that reporting for international duty has, at times, felt like a \"chore\".</p> <p>It probably says more about the ladies and gentlemen who follow their beloved \"Ing-er-lund\" than the man himself. Or maybe Downing is just an easy scapegoat because he plays for a club that is perceived as \"uncool\". Either way, it is a pity England's followers have to be so unforgiving when the target of their derision is, in so many ways, one of the few international footballers with whom the average man on the street should be able to identify.</p> <p>On Thursday, Downing was involved in a community project with some of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/middlesbrough\">Middlesbrough's</a> out-of-work 16- to 18-year-olds and, to see him in action, was to witness a throwback to those sepia-tinted days when top-division footballers always had time for other people and were naturally at ease in the company of supporters.</p> <p>\"I just really enjoy doing these things,\" Downing later explained. \"A lot of these people are from the estates where I grew up, so I can easily relate to them. People have it tough there but I know they are good people. They just need a bit of confidence, a bit of a push.\" </p> <p>Downing, you quickly learn, is not interested in diamond earrings or fancy haircuts. \"I have mates in football, but my real friends will always be the lads I grew up with,\" he says. \"They keep me totally grounded. It's like a reality check being around them. They're all Boro fans and they give me more stick than anyone.\"</p> <p>The classic local-boy-done-good, he is happiest in this environment and, as he goes through his life story it becomes very apparent that, just as Wayne Rooney has been shaped by his upbringing in Croxteth, Downing's personality emanates from his own childhood in Pallister Park - a part of Middlesbrough where, to borrow an old gag, even the alsatians go round in twos.</p> <p>\"It was tough but I would not change anything,\" he says. \"My mam and dad kept me out of trouble, watching out for me. Football helped too. There were always games after school to keep us busy. The teachers were pushy with me and helped keep me on the straight and narrow. But I do know other lads - good lads when they were younger - who went the way of drugs and prison. </p> <p>\"A couple of weeks ago I saw a lad who I had not seen for maybe five or 10 years. It turned out he'd been locked up. But he's got a wife and kids now and he told me he was doing well for himself, so good on him. It makes me pleased to know that the lads from my area who have had it tough and made a few mistakes can turn it around.\"</p> <p>Growing up, Downing's family did not have a car, meaning they had to find alternative transport to get him to football practice. \"My dad used to take me everywhere on his bike. I would sit on the crossbar with my boots over the handlebars and people would say, 'Here he is ... on his dad's bike again!' Rain, hail or snow, my dad was there, pedalling away. Looking back, he has to be the biggest influence on my career, in terms of determination and pushing me.\"</p> <p>Stewart Downing Sr worked on the oil rigs, or as a painter and decorator, but he was also a good footballer. \"He went to Aston Villa and they were going to take him,\" reports his son. \"But my mam was having her first child so he decided not to go. He wouldn't change anything either.\"</p> <p>Theirs is a close family, but it has not always been easy. \"I've had that [stick] at games and my dad does lose it sometimes,\" says the 23-year-old Downing. \"I tell him to try to ignore it. At Middlesbrough, for example, 95% of the crowd are brilliant to me. You will always get someone calling you, and the thing about Dad is that he always wants to fight my corner. There are a few stories I can't repeat.\" One is of him taking umbrage about the way Steve McClaren was treating his son, then 17, and pinning the then Middlesbrough manager against the wall. \"That's the one,\" nods Downing grinning. </p> <p>So what does Downing make of the England boo-boys himself? \"When you are young, you can take it to heart. You can drop. My message to anyone who boos is, 'What are you doing? It is not helping one bit'. I understand their frustrations but the players hold up their hands and say if they have not played well. It's not like we are trying to play badly.\"</p> <p>Has playing for England ever lost its enjoyment? \"I found that for a while. It was a little bit of a chore. Players would think, 'What's the point if I am only going to get booed?' But why should I let those people stop me doing what I want, and that is playing for England. It's still the pinnacle. They can boo all they want but if I get picked for England I must be doing something right.\"</p> <p>He knows, too, that it is a load of guff to say football is more important than life or death. When Downing was at primary school, his younger sister, Vicki, was fighting a losing battle against leukaemia. She contracted the disease when she was two and died when she was four. \"I didn't really know what was going on,\" he recalls. \"I try not to ask my mam and dad many questions about it. But I remember their visits to the hospital. It would be my mam one night, dad the next. It must have been hard for them. I'm just glad it happened when I was younger rather than older.\"</p> <p>Those childhood memories mean modern-day problems tend to pale into insignificance, but his professional life is not without other issues. Downing came close to leaving Middlesbrough a couple of summers ago, having been led to believe that playing on Teesside would affect his chances of playing for England. He was persuaded not to - \"the chairman [Steve Gibson] got to me,\" he smiles. Since then he has not just parted company with his agent, Ian Elliott, but made an allegation of fraud to the police. </p> <p>Elliott denies any wrongdoing and Middlesbrough's manager, Gareth Southgate, believes the affair may have damaged Downing's form. But the player disagrees. \"It's something I could do without but it has not affected my football. I have had to block it out. But I have had good support. Gareth has said to me, 'If you need anything we are there for you'.\"</p> <p>His club's caring side could also be gauged by the way Downing, Justin Hoyte and Andrew Taylor, devoted themselves to Thursday's project, as part of the Premier League's Creating Chances campaign. The players helped design a new strip, the idea being to encourage the participants to try new skills. Downing's own kit had sleeves that came off if defenders pulled at them and 'DJ Downing' on the back. </p> <p>\"I went over to Ibiza and did some deejaying in the clubs and bars,\" he explains. \"I am not interested in anything else, not golf, or cricket. I get a nervous excitement doing it, a bit like a big game. Plus you can chat to the crowd. It's something I might go into when I finish playing.\" But that is a long way away and, before then, the local-boy-done-good would like to think he can win over a national audience.</p>",
  "<p>Average <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/formulaone\">formula one</a> viewing figures on ITV this weekend are predicted to break last season's record, despite the network having ditched the sport in order to concentrate on live top-flight football, as it aims to go out on a high with a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/lewishamilton\">Lewis Hamilton</a> victory.</p> <p>Near the beginning of this season, the network dramatically opted to exercise a break clause in its contract with the formula one commercial rights holder, Bernie Ecclestone, in order to increase its bid for live Champions League football. The gamble paid off and it will now concentrate its sporting investment on live football, screening action from the Champions League, the FA Cup and England's home internationals.</p> <p>The BBC stepped in, paying around \u00a340m a year to bring formula one back to the corporation on a five-year deal. ITV is generally considered to have done a good job in revamping coverage of the sport, bringing in a younger audience and innovating with its production techniques. </p> <p>It has faced criticism at times for ill-advised scheduling of commercial breaks but the production team has won a string of awards for its coverage. Its average audience for the season so far stands at 3.2 million and the audience for the climactic Brazilian grand prix, which last year topped 10m, should enable it to beat last season's average of 3.4 million. </p> <p>Neil Duncanson, the chief executive of North One Television which produces ITV's coverage, said that his proudest achievement was introducing remote-control cameras that allowed viewers \"to get right in the thick of it, in the paddock and the garages\".</p> <p>The BBC is planning to produce its coverage in-house and hopes the sport will help it reach young, male audiences it finds hard to otherwise attract. Its coverage will also have a substantial broadband element and is likely to bring back the iconic Fleetwood Mac theme music that was used when it last held the rights 12 years ago. Although the BBC has yet to confirm its presenting line up it is believed to be trying to lure Martin Brundle from ITV to work alongside Jake Humphrey as anchor, Jonathan Legard as commentator and David Coulthard, who is retiring as a driver at the end of the season. </p> <p>Of ITV's decision to ditch the sport halfway through its deal, Duncanson said: \"It was a big disappointment. We were riding high on the Hamilton wave and it does rather chop the legs out from under you. But nothing lasts for ever and we wish the BBC well.\" ITV's director of sport, Mark Sharman, added: \"With the race for the driver's championship once again coming down to the wire, it should be a terrific finale.\"</p>",
  "<p>Short of practising in the Versailles Hall of Mirrors, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/andymurray\">Andy Murray</a> could have come no closer to playing himself than with Argentina's David Nalbandian on the other side of the net yesterday. They are hardly identical twins in temperament or looks but in terms of shot-making they have so much in common, most especially a two-handed backhand of sumptuous and exquisite timing and control. On this occasion Nalbandian was always just a shade better than Murray, beating him 7-6, 6-3, although it was a Paris Masters quarter-final of the highest quality on a day which saw the world's two leading players, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer, pull out.</p> <p>Murray acknowledged the similarity with Nalbandian: \"When we are on the ball we look like we have more time than we do. We prepare for our shots pretty early, although there are a few differences - I use slice a little bit more, he likes to change the direction of the ball more than me.\" It was both the similarity, and those small differences, which had a packed Palais Omnisports purring with Gallic delight.</p> <p>And so Murray's run of 14 consecutive victories came to an end, wins that have encompassed tournament triumphs in the Madrid Masters and St Petersburg. He was attempting to become the first player to win three consecutive Masters series, having won in Cincinnati in August, but when Nalbandian strikes this sort of form, as he did when winning here last year, beating Federer and Nadal in the process, he is almost in a class of his own. That Murray pushed him so hard, notably in an opening set of electrifying tennis, spoke volumes for his fast-accelerating improvement.</p> <p>The Argentinian, whose one slam final came somewhat incongruously at Wimbledon in 2002 when he was beaten by Australia's Lleyton Hewitt, is the only top-10 player whom Murray has yet to beat, their one previous meeting being three years ago at Wimbledon when, having established a two-set lead, Murray's teenage body and brain rebelled against the intensity of the situation in his first appearance on Centre Court. That was man against boy. Yesterday they were competing on equal terms and it was riveting.</p> <p>Nalbandian has struggled in all the slams this year, failing to get beyond the third round, which for a player of his ability is wretched. However, he has rediscovered his form indoors, winning a recent tournament in Stockholm, and it was Murray's misfortune to play him at the top of his game. \"I was disappointed to lose but it took him playing a great match to beat me,\" the Scot said.</p> <p>It was certainly that. Nalbandian broke for a 3-1 lead only for Murray to snap back immediately. \"I didn't serve particularly well in the tie-break and that was probably the one thing that cost me the first set,\" he said. His level had only to drop a fraction in the second set for Nalbandian to force home the advantage, breaking the Murray serve four times. \"Since Wimbledon I've played the best tennis of my life,\" he added, \"and hopefully I can keep it going.\"</p> <p>Federer pulled out of his quarter-final against James Blake of the United States with a sore back, a precautionary withdrawal in view of the end-of-season tennis Masters Cup which begins in Shanghai next Sunday. And there was further disappointment for the crowd when Nadal, with an injured knee, called it a day after losing the opening set 6-1 against Russia's Nikolay Davydenko. Two of the eight places for Shanghai remain open after yesterday's play, with Nadal, Federer, Novak Djokovic, Murray, Davydenko and Andy Roddick having qualified.</p>",
  "<p>The judges are right: parliament, not the courts, should clarify the law on assisted suicide. People like the multiple sclerosis sufferer Debbie Purdy and her husband should know whether he risks prosecution if he helps her travel to a Dignitas clinic to die in Switzerland. Less certain is whether parliament has the guts and the moral compass to find a way through a question that throws up so many difficult hypotheses. How does one know if would-be suicides are really mentally ill? Or if they have succumbed to family pressure, real or imagined? Or if they would feel differently in six months' time? For every case that, like Ms Purdy's, appears beyond argument, there are others that raise troubling questions. It is also true that the Purdy team are indulging in a sleight of emotion when they appeal for clarity in the law. There is little doubt what the law says about assisting suicide: it is illegal.</p> <p>So it seems safe to assume that the real purpose of Ms Purdy's case, like that of Diane Pretty's six years ago, is to challenge parliament to act on this most difficult of questions. For at least a decade there has been constructive ambiguity about prosecutions for assisted suicide, which is to say there have been none. The non-prosecution of the parents of the young rugby player Daniel James, paralysed at a training session, who made no secret about helping him travel to Switzerland to die, suggests that we are prepared to allow people to take advantage of countries where they have settled the question while continuing to duck it ourselves. This constructive ambiguity can be useful. But it cannot last for ever. A prosecution would have the merit of forcing the issue, as well as ending the absurd injustice that means only those who can afford it have the ultimate luxury of choice.</p> <p>But for there to be a chance of success in changing the law, which we support, there must be a less polarised public debate. Those most opposed to a change in the law, who blocked Lord Joffe's bill to legalise assisted dying, must give due space to its supporters' arguments and recognise their efforts to safeguard the vulnerable. In their turn, supporters need to recognise that concerns go beyond the religious. Despite the much-praised Oregon legislation, and legislation in the Netherlands too, there are still concerns that people choose suicide because of, say, curable depression rather than terminal illness. The matter might be resolved in Scotland, where Parkinson's disease sufferer, Margot MacDonald MSP, hopes she has triggered a backbench bill. MPs at Westminster - sitting for the shortest postwar session on record - can surely find the time to keep up.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on Wednesday November 5 2008. Margo MacDonald MSP, who is planning to introduce a bill to legalise assisted suicides in Scotland, has Parkinson's disease, not multiple sclerosis as we said above. This has been changed.</p>",
  "<p>As the most gripping US presidential election since 1968 enters its final few days, I have been talking with people in the downstate Illinois college town where I attended primary school and university, and left nearly 30 years ago to live in the UK. It was here that I voted for the first time in 1976 for Jimmy Carter. </p> <p>Carter was a puzzle to me then, though I have come to admire him. He spoke openly about his Christian faith - major American politicians on the national stage did not do that in the 1960s and 1970s. It wasn't that talking about faith and politics was an alien activity to me; it was bread and butter at our dinner table in a hybrid form of Anglo-Catholicism mixed with left-of-centre Democrat. But making an explicit connection between the two in public discourse wasn't done - in the same way prayers belonged in church and the home, and not in the public schools. </p> <p>Despite British stereotypes, there are plenty of American Christians whose faith informs their progressive political convictions and who believe it is the separation of church and state that ensures a healthy relationship between the two, at least in the American polity. Perhaps the biggest irony of American politics of the last 30 years was that it was the liberal Jimmy Carter who woke the dragon of the Christian right; a Dr Frankenstein whose creation crushed the most devout and theologically literate president of the modern era. </p> <p>The damage done by the Christian right needs no retelling here. A comment made by a friend in Illinois is that if you are a Christian, but not a conservative evangelical fundamentalist who has trouble distinguishing The Flintstones from the Book of Genesis, you hardly, if ever, describe yourself as a Christian. You are a Lutheran, a Roman Catholic, a Methodist, an Episcopalian, and so forth. The Christian right has taken possession of the word - we aren't just yet to that point in Britain.</p> <p>The other memory as I walk around this leafy college town, which would almost certainly have voted for Obama even if it wasn't in his home state, is a novel I read as an undergraduate, Irving Wallace's The Man, published in 1964 and made into a film in 1972. It tells the story of the first black president of the United States. In a country still marred by segregation and Jim Crow legislation, such a thing was only imaginable, even in fiction, by killing off the president and the speaker of the house in an improbable accident coupled with a vice-president too ill to take office. The succession fell to the president pro tempore of the Senate, a black senator from the midwest. (Let me translate: a modern English equivalent would be a novel about the first female Archbishop of Canterbury. A bishop of a small and poor diocese, she emerges as one of the few unscathed survivors after the ceiling has collapsed on a House of Bishops meeting. The novel would be entitled The Woman.) Wallace's improbable chain of catastrophes was the only way that the idea of an African-American in the White House was conceivable well beyond the 1970s.</p> <p>Yet here we are, possibly on the verge of seeing the first black president of the US. If Barack Obama takes possession of the Oval Office in January it will not be through a string of unlikely disasters but through the testing, in a grinding campaign, of a candidate who has fired the middle and progressive ground in American politics as no one has in decades. That is clear from listening to people, both town and gown, in the heartland of the midwest. He will also be the most theologically literate Christian in that office since Jimmy Carter. At such a transformational moment, perhaps Lutherans, Roman Catholics, Methodists, even the much-maligned (in certain Church of England circles) Episcopalians, can wrestle the word Christian back from the Christian right.</p> <p>\u2022 Dr Judith Maltby is chaplain and fellow of Corpus Christi College and reader in church history at the University of Oxford</p>",
  "<p>The humble cabbage has been rather eclipsed in recent years by more glamorous - or at least fashionable - leafy relatives in the brassica brotherhood: kale (curly, Russian, Tuscan), sprout tops and \"greens\" - which are usually just unhearted, immature cabbages.</p> <p>It's funny, isn't it, how fickle we chefs are with words and trends? Somehow, \"cabbage\" - of which there are dozens of outstanding varieties - has been deemed a passion killer. It's tainted by its past - soggy, slithery, green pulp dished up in works canteens, hospitals and school dining rooms everywhere. Its faintly sulphurous odour hangs like a gloomy pall over parts of our lives we'd rather forget.</p> <p>And who wouldn't want to expunge such grim memories? But by calling on the cabbage's close relatives that are not tainted by such associations, we're actually making a promise not only about the vegetable, but about how we're going to cook it. When a chef puts \"wilted greens\" on a menu, he's saying, \"Like cabbage, only not boiled to oblivion.\" In fact, more often than not, it is cabbage. We need to get over past shames and rehabilitate the cabbage without euphemism. I'd like to appeal to chefs everywhere: let's call a cabbage a cabbage, and carve its name with pride on our menus. </p> <p>To help the cause, home cooks must exercise quality control at the point of purchase: go for ones that feel heavy and have crisp stems. Just as fresh fish shouldn't smell \"fishy\", fresh cabbage shouldn't smell like the ghosts of school dinners past. When it comes to cooking them, less (cooking) is generally more (flavour). Depending on how finely you chop the leaves, three minutes in boiling, salted water is usually enough. It's also important to drain it well, to avoid the dreaded \"sog\" factor.</p> <p>Dressed simply in a little butter with lots of black pepper, cabbage is delicious. Or try saut\u00e9ing some ginger, chilli and garlic for a minute or so, then tossing in some lightly cooked cabbage for a minute before sloshing on a splash of soy sauce. For a great side dish to accompany sausages or roast meat, soften chopped garlic and caraway seeds in butter (or goose fat), add shredded raw cabbage, a splash of water and a sprinkling of salt, and saut\u00e9 for five minutes until the leaves are wilted. </p> <p>Cabbages, with their crunch and slightly peppery flavour, are great for autumn salads, too. Forget commercial coleslaw, gloopy with cheap salad cream, and go for something simpler and more vibrant. Mix finely shredded cabbage with grated carrot and maybe some finely chopped apple, before dressing in a strong, mustardy vinaigrette. </p> <p>We owe it not only to ourselves, but also to the cabbage to banish all memories of odorous school dinners for ever.

Place a big spoonful of meat mixture in the centre of each cabbage leaf, fold over the sides and roll up from the stalk end, until you have 12 neat packages, like spring rolls. Place seam-side down in an ovenproof dish. Pour the sauce over, dot sour cream on top and bake for 35-40 minutes, until bubbling and hot.

Their stoic aversion to the lure of victimhood puts you in mind of those heart-rendingly brave wartime East Enders, as filmed by Pathe News, standing outside the smoking husks that had once been their homes, grinning in toothless defiance as they cheered the passing Mr Churchill.</p> <p>\"Very simple,\" Marcus Wareing said when asked recently why he had broken up with Gordon Ramsay. \"When you wake up in the morning and look in the mirror and all you see is a man who is constrained, confined and trapped, then you've got to change. I want to be my own man.\" </p> <p>Ah, the agony of imprisonment at the Berkeley, with Gordon as Mr Mackay. Not since John McCain in the Hanoi Hilton did any man suffer such grievous incarceration at a leading hotel. Until, finally, Marcus drove out his jailer - Gordon departed the Berkeley, taking with him the name of Petrus and leaving his erstwhile close buddy sprinkled with the fairy dust of eponymity.</p> <p>In principle, this must be a wise move. A few weeks ago, I banged on about how that other top Ramsay prot\u00e9g\u00e9e, Angela Hartnett, should do the same, her luminescent talent demanding a restaurant that reflects her personality rather than her ever more corporately minded lord and master. The minor problem here, I think, is that Marcus Wareing At The Berkeley remains, in spirit, a Gordon gaff. It's still the earliest of days, but for now the room retains the faintly clinical aura of one created with public company money. It looks warm enough - with velvety, deep mauve walls and plush carpet - but it feels a bit chilly, characterless and temple-of-foody, as grand hotel restaurants so often do.</p> <p>For all that, the outstanding and ever reliable Harden's guide recently declared this London's finest, and if scores of well-informed Harden's \"reporters\" (aka well-informed punters who pay their own bills) rate it so highly, there must be sound reason for that. And yet while there is no denying Wareing's brilliance, only one dish screamed \"Best In London\". Several amuse-bouches were excellent, as was my friend's starter, from the dearer, \u00a375 \u00e0 la carte menu, of poached lobster with braised pig's trotters, vanilla butter and roasted salsify. It grew on him, an initial, \"Mmmm, nice enough\" developing into an appreciation of how well the intensity of the trotters worked with the delicacy of the lobster. My starter of fantastically fresh, honey-soused sardines with ricotta, crayfish and sweet peppers, from the slightly perfunctory \u00a335 set lunch menu, zinged with sharp, clear flavours, but there was an irksome parsimony about the portion.</p> <p>My main course of poached and glazed organic chicken (sausage-shaped breast, crispy wing and thigh) with onion fondue was a textural delight, and the skin was wonderful, but this was more comforting than electrifying, and palpably oversalted. My friend's Welsh suckling pig, \"cooked for 24 hours\", with braised chicory and pommes mousseline, echoed his starter by improving with every mouthful, until a cursory \"good\" had been upgraded to an animated, \"God, that's good.\" But why will they rush these things? Another few days and it would have been incredible.</p> <p>The best came last in the form of a pudding recommended by one of myriad waiters, all of whom stayed the right side of over-attentive. Raspberry and milk chocolate gateau with Eton mess was fine, but my baked egg custard tart was just sensational. I vaguely recall Wareing winning a Great British Menu puds section with this riot of creamy, eggy, cinnamony rapture, and serving it to the sovereign. And no wonder, because what a magnificent dish this is to set before a queen. </p> <p>All in all, then, this was a fine meal with moments of the sublime, but without quite fulfilling admittedly stellar expectations. By and large, the cooking seemed less spellbinding than I remember it when Wareing was first banged up at HMP Berkeley several years ago. </p> <p>\"If he wants me never to get to the status I want,\" says this culinary Norman Stanley Fletcher of Gordon's alleged ambition to prevent Marcus ever matching his own Michelin haul, \"then my advice to him is: put a gun to my head, shoot me, put me in a box and bury me, because if you don't, I'll come back and come back. I'll never give up until I get to where I want to go.\" In other words, to borrow from another fabled stoic who once fell out with a Gordon, he's a fighter not a quitter, so that third star may well one day be his. On this form, however, he has a little way yet to travel along Freedom Avenue.</p> <h2>The bill</h2> <p><strong>Three-course \u00e0 la carte: \u00a375</strong></p> <p>Lobster &amp; pig's trotter<br>Welsh suckling pig<br>Raspberry &amp; chocolate gateau</p> <p><strong>Three-course set lunch: \u00a335</strong></p> <p>Soused sardines <br>Poached and glazed chicken<br>Custard tart </p> <p>Bottle Lis Neris pinot grigio \u00a335</p> <p>Glass Bonny Doon Cigare Volant \u00a313.50</p> <p><strong>\u00bd</strong> bottle Innocent Bystander \u00a322</p> <p>2 coffees (with lavish truffles) \u00a310</p> <p>Subtotal \u00a3190.50</p> <p>Service @ 12.5% \u00a323.81</p> <p><strong>Total \u00a3214.31</strong></p>",
  "<p>The Reverend Dr Ian Paisley is such a nice old fella. Let us all be like this, I thought at one point, if by God's grace we reach 82. From the moment he came into the room until the moment, an hour and 15 minutes later, that I left it, his predominant mood was sweet good humour. So many of his thoughts and memories had a smile or a laugh attached to them - laughter that seemed not at all forced, quite boyish in its pitch. Sometimes it took me a while to understand the comedy. Why, for example, did he smile when he described his birthplace, Armagh, as \"the ecclesiastical capital of the great country of Ireland\"? Eventually the penny dropped. His smile was the sardonic equivalent of quote marks: the archbishops of both the Church of Ireland and the Roman Catholic church have their palaces in Armagh, episcopacy is ridiculous and undivided Ireland a fantasy. No mention, though, of the great whore of Rome. </p> <p>I asked why he had softened. \"Well,\" Paisley said, \"I'd say people who would think that might possibly not know me,\" meaning on the one hand that he was no softer than before and on the other that softness had always been one of his qualities, though not well advertised. But the Chuckle Brothers? The picture of him as Northern Ireland's new first minister with Martin McGuinness, formerly of the IRA, as his deputy, an unlikely partnership of bitter enemies, laughing fit to bust - it must have surprised and upset some of his supporters?</p> <p>He laughed. \"Oh, I'm sure it did. I said to one of them one day, 'Do you want me to go about with a long face? Far better to have McGuinness chuckling and going about his business in a democratic way than having him as the head of the IRA killing people.' \" </p> <p>But Paisley wanted to have it both ways. \"And that Chuckle Brothers photograph, you know, was never taken. That was two separate photographs...\"</p> <p>\"Really?\"</p> <p>\"Oh, we were taken together many times, but that picture was taken when the prime minister [Tony Blair] was here and the prime minister was sitting beside me and I said to the pee em, 'I don't know why so many people don't like me - because I'm a very likable person.' D'ye know?\" He was laughing again. So was I. \"And we laughed. And McGuinness was in another part of the room and he laughed. And they put those two photos together.\" </p> <p>Other photographs, no less jolly, were surely not faked. He has a selective memory of the past, of which in his case there is so much. We met in his office at Stormont, the most majestically sited government building in the United Kingdom, opened by Edward, Prince of Wales in 1932 when Paisley was six years old. A statue of Edward Carson, without whom Northern Ireland would not exist, stands near the top of Stormont's steep lawns. Paisley has a sketch of the same great Unionist hero hanging on the office wall. </p> <p>The state Paisley served as first minister is only a little older than he is, and it has never been secure. He remembered that one night his father had been taken off his motorbike by the IRA and put against a wall to be shot. \"And there was this Roman Catholic man who came and spoke to them and said this man's a minister and his wife's just given birth to a baby boy. And he said you can take this man's life but his blood will be on you for ever. So they let my father off with a strong warning that he tell nobody. And he didn't because he was a wise man.\" He finished the story, laughing. \"The baby boy was me. So you could really say I was rescued from the jaws of the IRA that early.\"</p> <p>His ancestors were not old Ulster Protestant stock - not, as he said, \"Plantation men\" who settled there in the 17th century. They had perhaps the zealousness of the newly arrived. His father's father moved from Scotland to Tyrone about 1870, his mother from Scotland to Lurgan in the early decades of the 20th century. Unlike the leading lights of \"official\" Ulster Unionism, all now dead or dimmed, he was not well born. His father left his trade as a draper to become a Baptist preacher. His mother until her marriage worked as a governess to a doctor's family in Lurgan - \"Dr Darling,\" Paisley said, \"a very prominent physician and a leading light in the Plymouth Brethren.\" The words give a clue not just to Paisley's age, but to a part of these islands that clung to ways of believing and living that had vanished elsewhere (even in Presbyterian Scotland) long before. That he campaigned against homosexual law reform (\"Save Ulster from Sodomy\") is not surprising; he is, after all, Westminster's oldest MP and gay rights are relatively new. But to discover that as a young preacher he opposed liquor advertising on the sides of Belfast tramcars is to realise that he survives from what in English terms is a different age, an age at the furthest edge of living memory, if not necessarily a worse one. </p> <p>He was brought up in Ballymena. I asked about Sundays there in his youth. \"It was a very strongly Sabbatarian town. I am still a strong Sabbatarian. I think Sunday should be observed as it was in my young days - it would be better for everybody. It was a long religious day. Morning service, afternoon Sunday school, evening service. And the preacher would preach from three-quarters of an hour to an hour. They weren't just sips, y'know? You didn't have much time for anything else.\"</p> <p>\"You found it uplifting and necessary?\" </p> <p>\"I was brought up to try to attain the means of grace. You needed to know the lessons of the Bible, the Presbyterian shorter catechism. That was a must.\" </p> <p>\"You never had any doubts?\"</p> <p>\"I would doubt the man that never doubted.\"</p> <p>\"But you reconciled those doubts?\"</p> <p>\"I believe the Bible is the word of God. What the Bible says I believe is true. There are things I don't understand, but those mysteries are part of the proof that God exists.\" </p> <p>\"These days you would be called a creationist.\" </p> <p>\"Oh yes. And a fundamentalist. An evangelical fundamentalist.\" </p> <p>\"That would mean Adam was the first man, the world was created in a week, and we are all descended from the children of Noah?\"</p> <p>The reverend doctor said that would most certainly be the case. He was chortling. \"I don't have any desire to be related to monkeys. They are not my pedigree.\" Entirely unconscious of any treacherous similarity, he gave a little primate-like whoop. </p> <p>He has neither smoked nor drunk. Dancing, though I didn't ask about it, would be even less likely. His older brother Harold volunteered for the RAF in the second world war and became \"a terrible drunkard and gambler\" until \"a wonderful conversion\" led him to the Plymouth Brethren and Canada (where he still preaches), but carnal and irresistible temptation seems never to have come Ian's way. Lack of national service may be partly to blame. Fearful of nationalist opposition, the British government never introduced conscription to Northern Ireland, which allowed him to pursue his Bible studies at colleges in south Wales and Belfast without interruptions in uniform. His loyalty to the British Crown has been expressed entirely in words and public stunts: a recruiter rather than a fighter, but with some bloody-minded recruits.</p> <p>Trying to get some idea of his secular pleasures, I asked about the cinema. \"Oh no, we never went to the cinema. You didn't go to the cinema. It was looked upon as a place that you didn't frequent if you were a Christian.\"</p> <p>Would he go to the cinema now? \"No.\" Had he ever been to a cinema? \"Oh yes, I have.\" He was beaming. \"The first time I went to the cinema was to see a picture of Oliver Cromwell.\" That would be the one with Richard Harris and Alec Guinness? \"That's right. It was very enjoyable.\" Oliver Cromwell came out in 1970. Ian Paisley was at least 44 before he sat in a darkened hall looking up at a screen - one of the great universal experiences of the 20th century - and he has rarely, if ever, repeated it. </p> <p>Books are what matter. He has published 20: titles such as A Text A Day Keeps The Devil Away and so forth, but also An Exposition Of The Epistle To The Romans, which he wrote in 1966 when he was serving a three-month prison sentence for unlawful assembly (St Paul also wrote his letters from a cell, but unlike Paisley was not rewarded with an honorary doctorate from the Bob Jones University, Greenville, South Carolina). He is also a bibliophile, by his own account an avid reader who has a library of about 20,000 books, a number that is constantly growing. He said he visited secondhand bookshops wherever he went; it was his perfect recreation. He was well known for it in the trade: \"People in secondhand bookstores will say, Ian Paisley was here.\" </p> <p>And what did he buy? \"History. Anything that would come my way. I couldn't do without books.\"</p> <p>Recently on official business in Dublin, he'd been taken around Trinity College's library (which holds the Book Of Kells) by the university's provost. Did they have all 22 volumes of the work of Archbishop Usher, the first Protestant archbishop of Ireland? No, the provost said, only two of the 22 were held by the library. Ah, but Paisley had the full set! He told the story proudly but charmingly. </p> <p>\"So you're going to donate your full edition to Trinity College?\"</p> <p>\"No, I am not!\"</p> <p>No fiction, I noticed. What novels had he liked? We had to go back a long way - to his childhood, which means to the childhood of our Victorian ancestors. He mentioned two authors, Captain Marryat and Joseph Hocking. Marryat's most famous book is The Children Of The New Forest, though Paisley remembered stirring adventure stories set in Canada. As for Hocking (1860-1937), he wrote as a Methodist minister who took an excited view of the Vatican, and though his books have attractive titles (The Scarlet Woman, The Purple Robe), their plots must be no more than hazy memories even in the Orange lodges of County Tyrone. </p> <p>Materialism - peace from the horn of plenty - has melted religion as the paramount social influence in both parts of Ireland. I tried to put it to Paisley that in the big scheme of things mammon rather than the Pope had turned out to be the enemy. The Protestant-Catholic conflict has been shrunk by new habits of spending and disbelief. In Belfast, chapels have been turned into wine bars, church attendance is sparser even in his own church, liquor is served at political dinners even of his own party. And next to the City Hall, that former bastion of Protestant rectitude, a big wheel like the London Eye has been set up, where people pay money and have fun. To have Paisley emerge as the leader of such a society is like imagining the Ayatollah Khomeini (a smiling version) in charge of Dubai. </p> <p>I asked the question about the triumph of consumerism in various ways, but it always seemed beyond him. It was as though he had heard a different question, about the things that had obsessed him for the past 60 years. He said: \"I believe in the complete freedom of people to make their choice religiously, but... I don't believe you can make men Christian by passing laws.\" And: \"People looking in on Northern Ireland had the idea of it as a place where Roman Catholics were persecuted. There was far more taking away of similar religious liberties in the south than there ever was in the north.\"</p> <p>Likewise, a question about the Unionist community. As the Northern Irish historian ATQ Stewart once wrote, conflicts don't have solutions, they have winners and losers. A common perception is that the Unionists have lost. Many of their aspiring young have migrated over the water, a process that began long before the Chuckle Brothers assumed power in the new Stormont assembly. No reliable figures are available, but there's an acronym, Nipples, to describe Northern Ireland Protestant Professionals Living in England and Scotland. Didn't this loss sadden him? Again, he heard something else - a question about his own behaviour. </p> <p>\"Well, my reading of the matter is that in the political world you should have the ability to work together with people who have other views. I have worked with the Sinn F\u00e9iners and I was accused by many people on my side of being a traitor and all that, but that doesn't worry me at all. I was always of the opinion that we could find a solution to our problems here by people realising that they couldn't have all that they wanted. Leaving aside the religious issues, I believe I can work with people, even those I detest for some of the things they've done in the past. They know where I stand. I'm in the fortunate position that I don't need to explain to my people what I stand for because I've made my views public for a whole generation.\" </p> <p>It was interesting to hear him say that - how he had made his people realise they couldn't have all that they wanted; which meant, though he didn't say this, all that they'd had. So many Unionist politicians had started down the same road of persuasion, beginning with Terence O'Neill in 1965. When the Irish taoiseach, Sean Lemass, came north to meet Northern Ireland's prime minister that year - an unprecedented visit - Paisley raged against O'Neill as a traitor and dictator. The same with O'Neill's forgotten successors: Chichester-Clark, Faulkner. The same with the Sunningdale Agreement, the Anglo-Irish Agreement, the Belfast Agreement, the Presbyterian church, the civil rights movement, the ecumenical movement: all treachery to Paisley's version of the Protestant and Unionist cause, all to be attacked and demeaned and conspired against and sometimes destroyed while the church and the party Paisley founded - the Free Presbyterian Church and the Democratic Unionist Party - grew ever larger, as, not coincidentally, did the IRA. </p> <p>Paisley stood against O'Neill, the mild reformer, in a Stormont election and eventually did for him. I wondered if he found it ironic that, 40 years later, he had found himself heading a government that in its radical composition, its need to satisfy Republican demands, went well beyond anything O'Neill could have dreamed of. </p> <p>\"Well, that is true, but then again, I mean, I didn't need to surrender any of my principles to do that. We had put on us by the British government a form of government that is not democratic [direct rule]. Do you continue in a state of having no say in your own country or are you prepared - not to sell your principles but to share power with people who accept the basis of democracy? I stood out - that I could not sit in a government until that government, all of them, accepted the rule of law and accepted the citizen's responsibility to give information about terrorist activity to the police.\"</p> <p>Nobody in London thought Sinn F\u00e9in would buy that. Paisley said that one day Tony Blair had called him seven or eight times to tell him he had to give in. \"I said, 'Look, please don't ring me again, I don't want to talk about this any more. I've told you there's a basis for government - everybody must be obedient to the law.' And eventually of course he gave in.\"</p> <p>He was chuckling again. \"Of course, he's a supreme actor.\" (And also, it might be added, a superb soft soaper; under his watch, Paisley became a Privy Councillor and his wife was installed in the House of Lords.) He has a kind word for several politicians. John Hume and Gordon Brown are both decent men, though Brown has been too mean with Northern Irish subsidy.</p> <p>\"Was Thatcher attractive to you?\" (After the Anglo-Irish Agreement of 1985, he'd led his congregation in a prayer asking God to take vengeance on \"this wicked, treacherous, lying woman\".)</p> <p>\"Margaret? I got on well with Margaret.\" He told a story of how he'd made her nearly smash a Downing Street chair with temper one night. \"Things were very rough over here and she'd come in from a long debate in the House. Her hair had got the worse for wear in the day and she was wretched looking. She pulled her chair up to the fire and she kicked off her shoes, one to one corner, the other to the other, and she said, 'Ian, what do you want?' \" </p> <p>It was a vivid picture. \"And oh, I was seething mad about a lot of things - people were shot dead night after night and I was very angry. And she lost her head and she brought her fist down on the chair's arm and nearly broke it.\" Paisley reprimanded her that prime ministers should not lose their tempers. Thatcher shouted that he shouldn't dare speak to her like that. Eventually she calmed down and, according to Paisley, asked his forgiveness. \"I told her, 'I'm a Christian, prime minister, and I'm glad to forgive you.' </p> <p>\"She didn't know whether to laugh or cry. Oh aye, Margaret Thatcher was a good woman. I believe she was sincere and honourable, but of course at night she was sore on the bottle, very sore on the bottle. I have seen her almost drunk, aye. She must have a very good constitution.\"</p> <p>It takes one to know one. Until his late 70s, Paisley was both an MP and an MEP, the leader of both his party and his church, institutions that he founded and shaped entirely to his will and ends. He still does three jobs, representing the constituents of North Antrim at Westminster and Stormont, and preaching at his church twice on Sundays. He rises early. Some mornings he's up and reading his Bible at 5am. He has five children and 10 grandchildren. \"And I hope to have a great-grandchild shortly. We're keeping the votes up! They're all Paisley voters.\"</p> <p>What formidable energy has been at work here, and what a formidable ego. How else, other than divine intervention, can you explain the success of a British-Irish politician in the early 21st century whose career depended on the simple slogans of \"No surrender!\" and \"Never\", for whom the Reformation has remained the last great human development. </p> <p>And then, in 2007, \"Never\" was suddenly abolished and Paisley became first minister, a Chuckle Brother for a year. His resignation in May puzzled many people. An illness was thought to have affected him; his son, Ian Junior, had been named in a story alleging sleaze. The better explanation, it seemed to me, watching him laugh so likably, was that at last his ego had been sated.</p>",
  "<p>Nitin Sawnhey clearly has too many women. \"Please welcome back Luci [Jules],\" he begins, as another female vocalist - Tina Grace - departs the stage. \"No, hang on ... she's not on until the next number.\" He also has too many songs. \"This is called ... I'm losing my marbles, actually,\" he admits, which isn't the song title. Finally, he becomes lucid and introduces \"Distant Dream, from my new album\".</p> <p>Still, Sawnhey has earned the right to be confused after producing a whopping 40 film scores and no fewer than eight albums. The latest, showcased here, is London Undersound, his vibrant response to life in the capital post-7/7. Unfortunately, this is a more stripped-down performance than the one the city enjoyed earlier this week. There's no London Undersound orchestra and fewer guests. Nevertheless, the man quietly strumming an acoustic guitar 200 miles north of the site of his inspiration is greeted like a homecoming hero.</p> <p>The music doesn't always match up to this reception, often suffering from a tasteful dinner-party vibe; at times it could pass for Latino restaurant Muzak. However, October Daze, sung by Grace, is lovely; flutes, cello, drums, pianos and tablas mesh together with great effect. At their best, this band sound like an Asian version of Jah Wobble's genre-busting Invaders of the Heart; elsewhere, Sawnhey and two of his musicians show what extraordinary sounds can be created with just human voices. Dead Man is a thunderous groove, while Prophesy features just guitar, tablas and rage. </p> <p>The London Undersound absences tell, though; Paul McCartney's non-involvement more understandable than that of young rapper Natty, whose account of the De Menezes shooting, Days of Fire, opens the album so powerfully. Maybe the rapper - who did appear with Sawnhey in the capital - has developed a sudden aversion to travel.</p>",
  "<p>The best way to experience an Obama rally is to listen to him while watching the audience. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/barackobama\">Barack Obama</a> is, of course, impressive. His speeches, like his suits, are meticulously measured. In this final week they are tailored to consolidate rather than convince. Though he is reed-thin, he can fill an auditorium, stadium or park with his presence as well as with people. With a big smile full of white teeth, he looks like the most all-American candidate the Republican party has had the misfortune to attempt to dismiss as non-American and demonise as anti-American.</p> <p>But the audience is something else. There are old black ladies dressed for church, whose hands palm up as if to pat the sky while their heads bow down, resonating points Obama makes, with hats perched on buns of salt-and-pepper hair. When he makes points that resonates their heads go down like as their hands go up, palms open, as though they are trying to pat the sky. </p> <p>There are young white kids, their universities emblazoned on their hoodies, who roll their lower arms in big circles from the elbow as though showing appreciation at a football game. There are old white veterans who occasionally nod but otherwise stay seated while others rise. And there are black children held high on parents' shoulders so they can capture a moment they do not yet fully understand.</p> <p><strong>Contagious energy</strong></p> <p>The energy is contagious. Bettie Bell, 87, was swaying to Stevie Wonder's \"Signed, Sealed, And Delivered\" as she tells me she \"never thought I'd see this day\" when a black man might be president. Bell grew up in Mississippi and moved to Ohio when she was 20. \"We couldn't vote back then. But this time I voted already ... The Bible says, 'One day a small nation will rise up.' Well it's our time and it feels wonderful.\" </p> <p>The numbers are staggering. A capacity crowd of 4,900 in the civic centre in Canton, Ohio; 9,000 outside in the teaming rain in Chester, Pennsylvania; 35,000 at 11pm in Kissimmee, Florida. </p> <p>To hear supporters talk, you would think they have come not out of volition, but compulsion. \"I just had to be here,\" says Jeannie, who drove from West Palm Beach to Kissimmee to see Obama. \"I can hardly believe I've come this far to go to a rally in the middle of the night. But it's history. I had to see it for myself at least once.\"</p> <p>As the week drew to a close, the mood was torn between anticipation and anxiety. On the one hand, supporters feel as though they are on the verge of a great historical moment. On the other, they resist the complacency that could deny it to them. For the last 20 months they have been told to believe. With 72 hours to go, they dare not believe too much.</p> <p>\"After the last two times I just don't want to jinx it,\" says Susan Aylward, from Akron, Ohio. \"Everything looks good. But I won't believe it until it actually happens.\"</p> <p>In the parts of the country where the election will be decided, they've counted chickens before, and have no intention of doing it again. Chris Magoon, a field organiser in Canton, told people to \"put the polls away\" and reminded them that Ohio was lost in 2004 by just nine votes per precinct. When the pastor who delivered the convocation in Chester, Pennsylvania, the same morning said: \"Lead us not into temptation,\" the sin he was referring to was hubris.</p> <p>There is also the pervasive fear that Obama might be assassinated. Nobody says it out loud, but nobody needs to. The pastor who blessed the Chester rally called for God to \"deliver us from evil that will harm any candidate\". In Canton the clergyman looked for God to \"Love him, carry him and keep him\".</p> <p>Then there are worries that the election will be stolen. The pastor in Canton prayed that \"every voting machine will work correctly\". Jeannie in Kissimmee shrugged at what surprises election day might bring. \"It's Florida,\" she says. \"You just never know.\"</p> <p>And finally there is mistrust of polls that may mask racial prejudice. Rosa Scott of Canton, who is in her 70s, grew up in Montgomery, Alabama, and remembers the bus boycott lead by Martin Luther King. \"Down there they let you know if they didn't like you. But here they're more sneaky with it.\"</p> <p>Obama opened the last full week of campaigning in Ohio with his closing argument. It is a hybrid of the unifying themes that first gained him national attention - reassurance that his taxation policy will only affect the very wealthy, and his trademark call for change. He rose to prominence in 2004 because of his opposition to the war. But as he heads to the finish line four years later Iraq barely gets a mention.</p> <p>The question in this election, he says, is not: \"Are you better off than you were four years ago?\" - referring to Ronald Reagan's now famous jibe at the Carter years. \"We already know the answer to that. Will this country be better off four years from now?\" </p> <p>In a populist turn, he asks the audience: \"How many of you earn less than $250,000 a year?\" When they all put up their hands he continues, \"Well, my tax policy won't cost you a dime.\"</p> <p>Ridiculing McCain's claim that his \"desire to spread the wealth\" makes him a socialist, he said: \"Lately, they've been calling me a socialist and they found evidence that when I was in kindergarten I used to share my toys, and in the fourth grade I split my peanut butter sandwich and they said look, he's a redistributionist ... There's nothing wrong with looking out for other people.\" The Florida crowd starts a chant of \"O-bama\". </p> <p>As he flies around the country, local and national events provide him with a strong tailwind. On the day he came to Ohio, the Cleveland Plain Dealer's front page was about Friday's collapse of Ohio's largest bank, National City. The next day the Philadelphia Inquirer showcased the conviction of Alaska's Republican senator, Ted Stevens, on six counts of ethics violations, bringing the possibility of a filibuster-proof Senate one vote closer. </p> <p>As he took to the stage in Kissimmee, the Orlando Sentinel reported that polling hours had been extended to cater for the unprecedented surge in early voting, with registered Democrats overrepresented and African Americans punching almost twice their demographic weight at the booths.</p> <p>For all the caveats, caution, denial and downplay, Obama's itinerary explains why he has every reason to be confident. With the exception of Pennsylvania, Obama has spent the last week travelling in states George Bush won in 2004. He needs 18 more electoral college votes than Kerry to win. </p> <p>He hasn't been behind in a poll in Iowa (seven votes) since he accepted the nomination, nor in New Mexico (five) in seven weeks. He has led in Virginia (13) and Colorado (nine) for the past month, and Florida (27), Ohio (20) and Nevada (five) for at least the last week. He is mounting challenges in North Carolina and Missouri. </p> <p><strong>Tightening race</strong></p> <p>He only needs one or two of these polls to be right to win. His team expect the race to tighten in these final days. But for him to lose, there would have to be a full-scale, last-minute reversal.</p> <p>With Bill Clinton by his side in Florida for the first time, the Democratic party's generational baton-change is almost complete. Leaving the stadium in the dead of night, the weight of expectation is evident in the T-shirts on sale. Some bear a socialist-realist print of Obama's face with a single word like Hope, Progress, Believe or Change. One shows Obama and Martin Luther King with the message: \"Dreams we can believe in\". Another has him dressed like a secret service agent and \"Mission Possible\".Yet another in Spanish says: \"Nosotros creemos en el cambio\" (We believe in change). </p> <p>With only three days left to sell, hawkers scour the crowd for people who might yet buy. They've bought his message. But will they wear it? It's five to midnight. He's closed his arguments. Now he has to close the deal.</p> <h2>Key moments of the campaign</h2> <p><strong>January 3: Iowa Democrat caucuses</strong></p> <p>Barack Obama wins Iowa caucuses after deploying large group of paid field staff who organise supporters, ensuring a big turnout. His victory proves his viability, especially among wary African-American voters, and anoints him the early front-runner.</p> <p><strong>January 7: Clinton cries in New Hampshire</strong></p> <p>The former first lady is fighting for survival when one voter's innocuous question about her appearance \u2014 how do you manage? \u2014 leads to tears<br>before the TV cameras. What initially looked like a gaffe became the humanising moment she needed, and led to a win in New Hampshire. </p> <p><strong>March 4: McCain wins Republican nomination</strong></p> <p>Given up for dead in 2007, McCain surges to victory in four states and secures the Republican nomination He promises to give voters \"a contest of ideas\" rather than \"an uncivil brawl\" but he accepts George Bush's endorsement.</p> <p><strong>January 28: Kennedy backs Obama</strong></p> <p>Obama is often compared to John F Kennedy\u2014 both men sought the presidency as young, untested senators with a gift for oratory. He wins the powerful family's support when the late president's brother, Senator Ted Kennedy, and daughter, Caroline, declared him the heir to JFK's legacy.</p> <p><strong>February 29: The 3am phone call advert</strong></p> <p>The Clinton team, realising Obama is in for the long haul, tries to make voters fear his inexperience. Clinton's now-classic advert tried to make voters fear his inexperience, featuring the White House phone ringing in the dead of night, inspires numerous parodies \u2014 and more than a few stump speeches from John McCain.</p> <p><strong>April 28: The Rev Wright speaks</strong></p> <p>Obama faces tricky questions about his outspoken former pastor, whose sermons railing against US policies hurt his campaign with white voters. The Rev Wright responds with a combative speech accusing Obama of disowning him \"because he's a politician\".</p> <p><strong>May 6: Clinton's last stand</strong></p> <p>With her early advantage gone and her money running out, Clinton gambles all on winning Indiana and North Carolina. A narrow victory in the first and a loss in the second means the primary contest is all but over \u2014 but Hillary will not concede.</p> <p><strong>June 3: Obama clinches the nomination</strong></p> <p>It comes down to the very last states and the endorsements of super-delegates, put Obama over the victory line \u2014 and gives his wife their famous celebratory fist bump. Clinton does not admit defeat until days later,<br>leaving open wounds in the Democratic party.</p> <p><strong>August 28: Obama's acceptance speech</strong></p> <p>Republicans mock the Greek columns, the A-list celebrities, and the adoring throngs at Denver's Invesco Field. But when Obama emerges to give the first open-air nomination speech since Kennedy, even his critics agree it is a<br>political masterstroke, and Obama has all the momentum until ...</p> <p><strong>September 3: Meet Sarah Palin</strong></p> <p>The young governor of Alaska is the surprise choice for McCain's running mate. The choice dominates the news cycle and the Republicans find their new heroine after a convention speech combining spirited attacks with folksy appeals to God and country.</p> <p><strong>September 14: It's the economy, stupid</strong></p> <p>Wall Street investment banks Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers crumble under the weight of bad mortgage-related securities, the latest and biggest highprofile failures of the financial services industry. Obama takes advantage of American uneasiness, linking McCain to Bush and thus the crisis on Wall Street.</p> <p><strong>September 17: Palin falters</strong></p> <p>CBS news anchor Katie Couric's interviews with Palin on the law, economy and foreign affairs mark a turning point. Her cringe-inducing performance \u2014 she can only name one Supreme Court decision she disagrees with, the landmark abortion case, Roe v Wade \u2014 ignites a backlash among conservatives that persists throughout the election.</p> <p><strong>September 24: Hold the campaign</strong></p> <p>As Congress and the White House discuss the bail-out of the financial system, McCain says he will \"suspend\" his campaign and returns to Washington to help. He calls for a delay in the presidential debate. Obama calls his bluff, saying a president should be able to deal with two tough tasks at once. McCain's surrogates continue to attack Obama and campaign ads still run. The debate goes ahead as planned.</p> <p><strong>September 26: Face to Face I</strong></p> <p>The first of the three debates gives voters a side-by-side comparison of the 47-year-old gym buff and the 72-year-old former prisoner of war. In a sometimes caustic forum, Obama tries to tie McCain to Bush and McCain tries to paint Obama as dangerously inexperienced. Polls show a win for Obama.</p> <p><strong>October 2: Face to Face II</strong></p> <p>Vice-presidential debate. Sarah Palin holds her nerve against Joe Biden, delivering mostly coherent answers, surpassing expectations after the Couric interview and reviving Republican enthusiasm for her candidacy.</p> <p><strong>October 12: Enter Joe the plumber</strong></p> <p>Ohio labourer emerges as mascot for McCain's effort to tar Obama as a tax-and-spend socialist after he quizzes the Democratic candidate on the campaign trail. McCain claims that the case of Samuel Joseph Wurzelbacher proves Obama's policies will hurt the little guy. It turns out that he would actually be better off under Obama's tax proposals, but that does not stop Republicans from trotting him out at rallies.</p> <p><strong>October 19: Powell's sucker punch</strong></p> <p>Colin Powell, George Bush's former secretary of state and one of the most powerful African Americans in US history, broke with the Republican party, saying Obama \"demonstrated the kind of calm, patient, intellectual, steady approach to problem solving that I think we need in this country\". Some McCain supporters, notably radio host Rush Limbaugh, contend Powell made the pick because Obama is black.</p> <p><strong>October 29: Obama \u2014 The Movie</strong></p> <p>Obama runs a 30-minute TV ad on most major US television networks, at a cost of $1m per channel. The spot features the candidate describing his policies, and several down-and-out swing-state Americans explaining how hard they have it. The implication: If you are down on your luck, an Obama victory will improve your lot \u2014 especially if you live in Missouri, New Mexico<br>or Ohio.</p> <p><strong>Big Dog weighs in</strong> </p> <p>Days before the election, Bill Clinton holds a joint rally in Florida with Obama. Relations between the two had reportedly been testy after the bitter primaries battle, but they were all smiles and effusive praise on the night.</p>",
  "<p>Leon is a famous daddy. Or he is to his daughter. He's on television as often as she wants him to be, reading and re-reading her favourite stories and waving goodbye to her at the end of each tale. In his DVD for the story Let's Go Home, Little Bear, Leon wears his regulation-issue grey sweatshirt. He reads to the camera. Sometimes the shot cuts away to a scene in the book or the characters from the pages appear, as if by magic, moving on the wall behind him. At the end of the tale, Leon asks his little girl to be good and to look after her mummy. After watching the story, Leon's partner writes to tell him how much his daughter \u2014 who wasn't even born when her daddy went away \u2014 adores the bedtime stories he sends her.</p> <p>Leon is telling this bedtime story in a converted wing of Dartmoor prison. \"He's never met his daughter \u2014 she just knows him as the 'man in the telly',\" says Sharon Berry, creator of Storybook Dads.</p> <p>We are watching the film at the prison. Suddenly, Leon stops in mid-sentence and his image freezes . \"We need to go back and check the sound there and re-do the animation a bit,\" says Domonic, one of Leon's fellow inmates and unofficially the most valued editor on a scheme designed to allow prisoners to record bedtime stories for their children.</p> <p>A survey by <a href=\"http://www.alltopbooks.com\">alltopbooks.com</a> in June, revealed that one in three parents never reads bedtime stories, many claiming it's because they don't have time. In Dartmoor, where time is just what all the fathers do have, story-reading is a popular activity.</p> <p>\"On the outside, I read the odd story to my daughter,\" Domonic says. \"But since I've been in here I've read her loads. She's five now and I've lost count of how many I've done.</p> <p>\"At first you feel a bit daft reading a baby's story out loud into a recorder. It's even worse listening to them being played back, the mistakes you make, how dull a story sounds. But her mum told me she loved hearing them and I worked hard to make them better.\"</p> <p>The scheme was developed by Berry \u2014 an adult literacy teacher \u2014 using audio CDs. Then a visit by a TV producer inspired her to dabble in DVD stories and to introduce the puppets.</p> <p>You would think going back on the wings known as the man who spends all day playing with kids' toys would be a bad move in prison, but it's quite the opposite. \" Just by making a story in here, or writing your own ones like a lot of dads do, you're doing something positive ,\" says Domonic. Then he dons his headphones and sits at a PC under a barred window to digitally refine Leon's story. His co-editor, Chris, chips in: \"It's because you're doing something worthwhile and you're learning new skills,\" he explains. \"I worked in IT before I came in here so I'm good with the technical stuff. Domonic has learned loads. He developed the DVDs and the animation from scratch. He'd never really used a computer before he came here.\"</p> <p>Terri Bailey, Berry's assistant and one of six \"civilians\" working on the project, admits they will miss Domonic when he's released. \"He's great at getting the others to read comfortably. It's daunting when you first record a bedtime story, especially to camera, but he has a joke with them and it puts the nervous ones at ease,\" she says. \"We keep joking that he should try to come back to Dartmoor!\"</p> <p>Dominic is adamant he won't be returning. \"Doing the kids' stories is a reminder of what you're missing. I'd like to do a sound engineer or film editing job when I get out. I won't because of my record \u2014 but if ever they set up something like this outside I'd apply.\"</p> <p>Storybook Dads already exists outside the prison system. Berry was asked to advise the army on setting up Storybook Soldiers after a chance meeting in 2004. Today, servicemen and women record bedtime stories and messages to their loved ones from Iraq and Afghanistan following the Dartmoor template.</p> <p>On the day of our visit, an observer from the Royal Air Force Association is there too, taking notes on how the logistics of such a scheme might work for RAF personnel around the world.</p> <p>\"Back on the wings, it's all the typical macho, hard man stuff you probably expect prison to be,\" says Domonic. \"But in the editing suite, you see a more human side. When they're talking about their kids or flicking through the storybooks or choosing which puppet they'll do a DVD with, you see some blokes soften up.\"</p> <p>Bailey shows me files of responses from prisoners who have submitted stories. They contain lines about how their children have loved hearing daddy's voice and seeing him smile; some say the stories are better than the newspapers and magazines they get. There are cards on the sills at the barred windows from families thanking Berry and the team and photographs of Princess Anne watching Domonic in action at his editing desk alongside Terry Waite.</p> <p>All the equipment and the civilian staff are paid for by the charity. Inmates don't pay to record stories on to audio CD, but there is a charge \u2014 equivalent to the cost of a week's tobacco \u2014 for those wanting to record a story on to DVD.</p> <p>Not every Storybook Dad wants to record a DVD. Bailey plays us an audio story sent by an illiterate prisoner from another jail. He recorded Goldilocks and the Three Bears for his daughters, with the aid of a prison visitor. She reads each line and he copies her. Then the editors at Dartmoor edit out her prompts and add sound effects. On hearing the finished version, the prisoner said it was the best thing he had ever given his children.</p> <p>But the editors left his final message untouched, with the imprisoned father's voice faltering and breaking up as he wishes his girls goodnight and sweet dreams and to tell them he'll see them again one day soon \u2026</p> <p>\u2022 Some names have been changed.

  "<p>Just how low will your mortgage payments fall if, as predicted, the Bank of England slashes interest rates over the next few years towards 3% or even lower? If you have a fixed rate, then there's no joy for you. </p> <p>But before holders of \"tracker\" mortgages look forward to steep cuts in monthly costs, be prepared for a nasty shock. </p> <p>Some of the biggest lenders have small print terms which allow them not to pass on rate cuts, even if the contract says the loan is tied to the Bank of England base rate. </p> <p>And households whose mortgages track the \"standard variable rate\" may also see little benefit from cuts in base rate.</p> <p>So far, mortgage lenders haven't exactly been rushing to pass on the most recent base rate cuts. It emerged this week that half haven't cut standard variable rates following the emergency rate cut of 0.5% last month. </p> <p>The fear is, that even if the Bank of England's monetary policy committee slashes the base rate, it will be used as an opportunity by the banks and building societies to rebuild profit margins. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-339221579\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Money/Pix/pictures/2008/10/31/lowmortgage.jpg\" alt=\"How low could your mortgage go?\" width=\"220\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>How much of the benefit you will get largely depends on the type of mortgage you have. </p> <p>Tracker mortgage-holders have the most to gain. As the name suggests, the monthly repayments are supposed to track Bank of England base rates.</p> <p>However, it has emerged that several lenders have \"collars\" in place that mean that some customers could lose out. Ray Boulger, of brokers John Charcol, says collars have become a \"hot\" issue within recent days. \"Most mortgage companies have a clause in their terms and conditions that allow them to get out of tracking base rates down to zero - but only in exceptional circumstances. </p> <p>\"But if rates comes down normally, I wouldn't expect the mortgage firms to use those clauses and deny customers lower rates.\"</p> <p>He says that the Nationwide has a ceiling in place that means its tracker customers interest rates can't go below 2.75%, irrespective of what happens to base rates. </p> <p>Halifax has an option not to pass on rate cuts below 3%, but given that the government has taken a substantial stake in parent firm HBOS, it would be under pressure to pass on rate cuts. But it is better luck if you're with Abbey, RBS or Woolwich. They all said this week that their tracker rates would go as low as the BoE base rates dared. </p> <p>HSBC is somewhere in the middle - it will interpret its terms as market conditions emerge.</p> <p>\"The intention is that tracker mortgages will track downwards, as rates fall. However, the tracker terms and conditions do say that we reserve the right not to pass on cuts in base rate to tracker customers if there is a material change in the mortgage market. \"We have no appetite to do so, and our intention is to continue to meet our customers' expectations and pass on rate cuts,\" says an HSBC spokesman. </p> <p>\"There's been a lot of speculation about rates, but I'm not sure at this stage they'll go below 3%,\" says Boulger. \"While tracker customers look better off, you have to be concerned if you're on the SVR. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-339221580\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Money/Pix/pictures/2008/10/31/rates.jpg\" alt=\"Minimum tracker rate/ Lenders with a minimum pay rate\" width=\"220\" height=\"557\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>\"There is little incentive for the banks to cut those interest rates. Halifax recently changed its terms and conditions to allow its SVR to be up to 3% above base rates. Before, it could only charge up to 2% more,\" he warns.</p> <p>Meanwhile, if you want to take out a new tracker mortgage, rates have been shooting upwards in recent days. In the past, trackers were being offered at base rate plus zero or just 0.25%. Now lenders are demanding base rate plus 1.5%-1.75%.</p> <p>Michelle Slade, analyst at Moneyfacts.co.uk says: \"Despite the best efforts of the Bank of England to bring borrowing costs down, lenders just aren't passing the cuts on to consumers. Since the 0.50% cut at the beginning of October, numerous lenders have announced cuts in their tracker rates.

I stand by 100% any of the things we've ever said,\" he said. \"There's no way we can ever do a show while thinking 'Will David Davis MP approve of this?' Not all shows are intended for all people.\"</p> <p>The controversy was sparked when Brand and Ross left a series of lewd messages on the answer machine of actor Andrew Sachs. When the Mail on Sunday picked up the story a week later, it resulted in 37,500 complaints, an Ofcom investigation, a three-month unpaid suspension for Ross, and the resignations of Douglas and Brand. </p> <p>The BBC director general, Mark Thompson, attempted to wrest back control of the spiralling crisis on Thursday by suspending Ross and announcing the resignation of Douglas. He will deliver a full review on November 20 to the BBC Trust, which said it was \"dismayed\" and ordered an overhaul of editorial and compliance controls in BBC radio. </p> <p>Ross will not return to the screen until next January, losing \u00a31.3m in pay, and some BBC insiders questioned whether he could return to his Radio 2 slot at all, given his part in Douglas's downfall. It was announced that he would not host the British Comedy Awards on ITV in December during his suspension from the BBC. He has special dispensation in his \u00a36m a year contract to present the awards. </p> <p>A spokesman for Ross said: \"He would not want his participation in this year's event to take away from the awards themselves.\" </p> <p>Some BBC executives said that compliance procedures had already become more onerous in the wake of last year's scandals over faked competitions and that new systems would inevitably mean erring on the side of caution. </p> <p>Comedian Jimmy Carr, who has worked for both the BBC and Channel 4, said the furore was \"a storm in a teacup\" and said there was a \"silent majority\" who didn't believe Ross' punishment fitted the crime. \"Being on TV at the moment is like being at school and getting told off all the time,\" he said. </p> <p>Lyons, who has faced criticism for not acting publicly quickly enough, said: \"What this incident shows is that there are still areas of the BBC where the editorial responsibilities are not being taken seriously enough and they need to be reinforced.\" </p> <p>The departure of Douglas, the Radio 2 and 6 Music controller who brought the curtain down on a 23-year BBC career after saying she ought to carry the can for mistakes made \"on my watch\", was widely lamented. DJs including Terry Wogan and Chris Evans have spoken of their sadness at her decision to resign. \"I just hope that at least her sacrifice will bring everything back down to earth a little bit and will give a sense of proportion,\" Wogan told BBC News. </p> <p>Brand, who resigned on Wednesday in a failed effort to take responsibility for the scandal, said of Douglas's decision: \"I think it's really sad and I am upset.\" Asked if he felt responsible for her departure he quipped: \"I do. I wish I could resign twice but I'm not Peter Mandelson.\" </p> <p>Douglas could re-emerge in the music industry, where she was considered one of the most powerful and passionate figures in breaking British acts to mainstream audiences. Christian O'Connell, the breakfast DJ on Absolute Radio, said: \"I think it's a terrible over-reaction. I know how well respected Lesley is across the industry. I know I will [be more risk-averse]. If you're a producer at the BBC right now, you're not going to be taking any chances.\" </p> <p>But others said that Douglas was undone by her determination to give Brand a slot on the station, seen by some as one step too far in her policy of bringing in younger audiences and wooing key television talent. </p> <p>\"The analogy I make is: Achilles, great body - shame about the heel,\" broadcaster Paul Gambaccini said. \"She had all of these amazing qualities and wonderful abilities - but she had this one obsession that proved to be her downfall.\" </p> <p>John Lloyd, the producer of Spitting Image who is also behind the Stephen Fry-fronted panel show QI, said he hoped the incident led to a reappraisal of how risk- taking television was defined. </p> <p>\"What passes for risk-taking in television today is showing people having sex on Big Brother. That's not a risk - it's just grubby,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>Studs Terkel, the Pulitzer prize-winning author, broadcaster and master chronicler of American life in the 20th century, died last night. He was 96.</p> <p>Celebrated for his streetwise portrayals of the American working class, Terkel was best known for letting the common people he called \"the uncelebrated\" tell their stories in books like Working and The Good War.</p> <p>To generations of radio listeners he was also the voice of The Studs Terkel Show, which ran for 43 years and was widely syndicated across the US.</p> <p>The cause of death was not announced, but in recent years Terkel had been beset by various ailments and his health took a turn for the worse two weeks ago when he suffered a fall in his home. At his bedside was a copy of his latest book, PS: Further Thoughts from a Lifetime of Listening, scheduled for release this month. </p> <p>Born Louis Terkel, he was a native New Yorker who moved to Chicago as a child and came to personify his adopted town.</p> <p>He won the Pulitzer prize in 1985 for his nonfiction work The Good War: an Oral History of World War II, one of a dozen best-selling books he wrote.</p> <p>His first work was a little known book, Giants of Jazz, published in 1957, but he earned his fame with Division Street: America, compiled from interviews with Chicagoans from all walks of life. Using their own words, it told the stories, of businessmen, prostitutes and ordinary working people. </p> <p>It was a theme that Terkel would explore again and again, in Hard Times, his 1970 Depression era memoir; in Working, his saga of ordinary lives in 1974; and in American Dreams: Lost and Found in 1980. </p> <p>In 1986 he published Chicago, regarded by many as a distillation of much of what he had come to feel for a city that he was closely identified with. Capturing the voices of the city, he quoted ordinary men and women from social activists to police sergeants. His own voice was also present in the book's anecdotes and reminiscences about his family and growing up. Last year he marked his 95th birthday with the publication of The Studs Terkel Reader, My American Century.</p> <p>\"If I did one thing I'm proud of, it's to make people feel that together, they count,\" he said last year.</p> <p>In an interview with the Guardian this January, Terkel demonstrated his appetite for provocation was undiminished, wondering aloud of Tony Blair: \"Why was he such a house-boy for Bush?\"</p> <p>Writing in his last book, Touch and Go: a Memoir, he told how he had \"after a fashion, been celebrated for having celebrated the lives of the uncelebrated among us.\"</p> <p>\"I took a vacation once - it involved a beach - and to tell you the truth, I had no idea what to do with myself. It was torture. Work is life. Without it, there is no life.\"</p> <p>Born in 1912 to Russian Jewish parents, he got the nickname Studs as a young man from the character Studs Lonigan, the protagonist of James T Farrell's trilogy of novels about an Irish-American youth from Chicago's south side.</p> <p>After graduating from the University of Chicago in 1932, where he studied philosophy and law, early work as a stage actor led to radio acting, disc jockey jobs and radio interview shows. From 1949 to 1952, he was the star of a national TV show, Studs' Place, a programme of improvised stories and songs set in a fictional bar owned by Studs. Some viewers thought it was a real place, and would search for it in Chicago.</p> <p>In 1939, he married social worker Ida Goldberg, a marriage that lasted 60 years until her death in 1999.</p> <p>Their son, Dan Terkel, said in a statement last night: \"My dad led a long, full, eventful, sometimes tempestuous, but very satisfying life.\" Describing his father's death as \"peaceful, no agony\" he added: \"This is what he wanted.\" </p> <p>Speaking to a reporter last year, Terkel said \"My epitaph? My epitaph will be 'Curiosity did not kill this cat.'\"</p> <h2>In his own words</h2> <p>\"We are the most powerful nation in the world, but we're not the only nation in the world. We are not the only people in the world. We are an important people, the wealthiest, the most powerful and, to a great extent, generous. But we are part of the world.\"</p> <p>\"We can't make any choices unless we connect the past with the present. The thing that horrifies me is the forgetfulness.\"</p> <p>\"I'm known around the block as a writer and broadcaster, but also as that old guy who talks to himself.\"</p> <p>\"We're born eventually to die, of course. But what happens between the time we're born and we die? We're born to live. One is a realist if one hopes.\"</p>",
  "<p>Interest in Britain's first potential saint for 300 years yesterday was only a dribble which turned into a trickle, but advocates for Cardinal Henry Newman weren't dismayed. \"It takes a very long time to make a saint,\" said Peter Jennings of Birmingham diocese, as another handful of the devout or curious drifted into the city's Oratory to examine the latest stage in a 30-year campaign.</p> <p>Displayed to the public for the first time this weekend in a gold and glass reliquary, bought by the oratory a fortnight ago in New York, a silver thimbleful of soil from suburban Birmingham stood beside a scrap of stained linen and several wispy coils of grey hair. These are the First Class Relics from the Cardinal's grave, which join a list of other requirements - from a Decree on Heroic Virtues to 943 pages of Evidence of Holiness - for the Pope to award the ultimate honour to the 19th century divine. </p> <p>Newman is a towering figure for British Catholics, a convert from the Church of England whose upright life and inspirational hymns - including Lead, Kindly Light and Praise To The Holiest In The Height, galvanised the Catholic \"second spring\". But his path to sainthood has been strewn with obstacles, from failure to prove miraculous cures of ulcers to demands by gay campaigners that his body be left in peace in a grave shared - at Newman's express wish - with his lifelong friend, Rev Ambrose St John. Newman's sexuality has never been disclosed.</p> <p>Jennings, a natural enthusiast who also designs papal postage stamps, put a brave face on the debut of the scanty collection, which Birmingham's Archbishop Vincent Nichols described as turning the oratory into \"a place of quiet recollection and wonder.\" Although the church had spoken confidently of dividing pieces of bone among Catholic shrines, only brass coffin fittings and a splinter of rotted wood were found when excavation finally went ahead this month.</p> <p>Photographs in Jennings' files show a small JCB digger revealing the foresight Newman used to compost his casket, described by the Birmingham Post when 17 bishops and the Duke of Norfolk attended his funeral in 1890.</p> <p>\"It was covered with mould in studious and affectionate fulfilment of a particular desire of Dr Newman's,\" said the Post. This was to \"facilitate rather than impede the operation of the law: unto dust thou shalt return\", and it worked.</p> <p>\"The oratory cemetery is extremely damp, on the side of the Lickey hills and with a stream running through it,\" said Jennings. \"The undertakers hadn't been digging for long when they warned us that we'd be lucky to find any recognisable remains at all.\"</p> <p>The little symbols, including hairs collected during Newman's life, were satisfactory enough for reverent pilgrims who left invocations in a book which will also form part of the sainthood campaign. Messages such as \"Cardinal Newman, I forgive Sally\" and \"Please intercede for my dear niece who is very ill,\", could help overcome the next hurdle.</p> <p>\"The miraculous cure of an American deacon who invoked Cardinal Newman is being examined by the Vatican,\" said Jennings. \"If that succeeds, we are optimistic that he will progress from his present state of being the Venerable, to becoming the Blessed. But then we need a second physical cure for sainthood, and it has to be one which happens after he is confirmed as Blessed.\"</p> <p>Worthy of JRR Tolkien, who was the schoolboy ward of an oratory priest and may have taken the name of his Elvish haven Rivendell from Rednal, where Newman was buried, the slow ceremonial was supported by most visitors yesterday. Retired teacher Alec McDonald said: \"Sainthood would put God's seal on what we understand to mean by a great and courageous Christian life.\"</p> <p>A parallel dossier is being accrued by Peter Tatchell, who led the campaign against disinterment. His freedom of information requests have been denied 55 documents on the affair, but have produced a bundle which show both Catholic pressure and the Ministry of Justice's bafflement over the request - familiar in Catholic countries but so far unique in Britain.</p> <p>\"There is no way,\" says one urgent memo between officials struggling with theology and the Human Tissues Act 1904, \"in which we can check exhaustively in the time available regarding the exhumation of saints.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Thursday November 6 2008. We said Cardinal Newman could become Britain's first saint in 300 years. We meant that he could become the first Englishman who lived after the 17th century to be canonised. Others who lived earlier have been canonised more recently.</p>",

  "<p>A newly disclosed Downing Street memo has revealed how Tony Blair helped Rupert Murdoch overcome an official investigation which was jeopardising one of his big investments. It shows that Blair, while prime minister, immediately ordered his top officials to help the tycoon who was frustrated that a potentially lucrative scheme was being blocked by a long-running European commission investigation. </p> <p>Blair told the media magnate that \"he was instinctively sympathetic to what Murdoch was aiming to achieve\". The tycoon eventually won approval for the plan. BSkyB had teamed up with other big companies to develop an interactive scheme in which people could shop and manage their finances through their televisions. </p> <p>The memo is the first to be disclosed under freedom of information legislation documenting the contents of meetings between Murdoch and Blair. Blair has been accused of granting political favours to Murdoch in return for support from his newspapers; Lance Price, a former Downing Street spin doctor, said Murdoch seemed to be one of the four most influential people in the administration. </p> <p>The memo reveals an episode in 1998 - a year after the Sun's conversion to Labour - in which Murdoch appears to call in one of those favours. Murdoch had privately approached Blair when he feared that the European commission investigation was hindering his business opportunities. </p> <p>Blair gathered members of his inner circle to see the tycoon - his chief of staff, Jonathan Powell; James Purnell, then a Downing Street special adviser on the media and now a cabinet minister; and his press secretary, Alastair Campbell. </p> <p>Murdoch complained that the investigation by the European competition commissioner into one of his planned television schemes was costing him money. He told Blair: \"The competition commissioner, [Karel] Van Miert, had come up a long list of complaints and the project was being delayed at huge cost. Sky's own investment was very significant (\u00a3800m so far) and the success of the venture was crucial to their overall plans for developing digital services.\" </p> <p>According to the memo of the meeting in January 1998, Blair backed Murdoch, saying \"it was important that the UK remained at the cutting edge of developing this kind of media product\". The prime minister envisaged Europe being dominated by four or five big media groups - with Sky as one - competing against each other, adding \"that meant genuine cross- border competition, not a heavy regulatory approach from the commission\".</p> <p>The memo was released after a lengthy battle to Michael McCarthy, a retired further education teacher, who said yesterday he had wanted to know how an unelected businessman was influencing policy in return for the support of the Sun. </p> <p>The year after the meeting, Van Miert gave the television project the go-ahead with some restrictions. </p> <p>Initially the service, known as British Interactive Broadcasting, performed well but by 2001 it collapsed as people found it easier to shop on the internet.</p>",
  "<p>In three days' time, by most reckonings, John McCain's most cherished ambition - one that has absorbed him for the best part of a decade, the defining goal of a lifetime in politics - will go up in smoke. He faces a defeat on Tuesday that some experts predict will be solid, others catastrophic. No presidential candidate since Ronald Reagan in 1980 has overturned such a poll deficit at this late stage and won the White House.</p> <p>With such grim prospects, McCain could be forgiven for spending his final days on the campaign trail bemoaning his fate, but there was no sign of any weakness of purpose in the past week. Last Tuesday he was on stage in Fayetteville, North Carolina, shaking his fist not up at the sky but out towards the packed crowd, exhorting his followers never to give up hope, never to give up the fight.</p> <p>There was an urgency, an energy, to McCain that hadn't been seen before. His running mate, Sarah Palin, may be a self-declared \"lipstick-wearing pitbull\", but this week he proved himself a wiry Jack Russell terrier, snapping at the heels of his Democratic opponent.</p> <p>\"I'm an American and I chose to fight!\" Snap! \"America is worth fighting for!\" Snap! \"Nothing is inevitable here - we don't hide from history, we make history!\" Snap! Snap!</p> <p>This unexpected side grew more pronounced as the final week of campaigning progressed, on a trail that took us from Fayetteville, with its large military population, through the Cuban exile haven of Miami, Florida, and on to the rustic towns in the crucial battleground state of Ohio. With defeat looming, and an ugly blame game already bubbling up within his party, McCain's spirits appear to have soared in inverse proportion to his declining poll ratings. </p> <p>As one placard, held by a supporter in the aptly named Ohio town of Defiance, put it: \"Mac is back.\" Yes, he is back, but not in the way the supporter meant it. </p> <p>McCain is back in his comfort zone - fulfilling his traditional role as the underdog. \"I think he enjoys the underdog role,\" said Lincoln Diaz-Balart, a Republican congressman who campaigned alongside McCain in Miami.</p> <p>Turning adversity into opportunity has been a running theme, not just of this election but of the Republican candidate's life. When he was snared in the Keating Five political funding scandal in the late 1980s, he reinvented himself as an anti-corruption crusader and salvaged his reputation; his defeat against George Bush in the 2000 primaries was converted into a positive by spawning his current image as a maverick; after he ran out of money and was on the verge of giving up his second run on the White House last summer he rallied in a swing through New Hampshire. Now he is at it again, staring oblivion in the face yet drawing succour from it. \"The pundits have written us off just like they have several times before. They were wrong then and they are wrong now,\" he told the faithful in Miami's Little Havana.</p> <p>His team insists there is method in his madness. Bill McInturff, who conducts private polls for McCain every day in 14 battleground states, circulated a memo this week suggesting the race was tightening and Obama's lead in several states now fell within the margin of error. McCain was also gaining ground among three crucial demographic groups - men without university degrees, poorer women and rural voters. </p> <p>The plucky comments coming from the McCain camp, therefore, may be more than mere whistling in the wind. </p> <p>One aide said: \"Sure we've had ups and downs, but the senator is confident, the staff are confident, and the campaign is ready for victory next week.\" </p> <p>The most extravagant chutzpah came from McCain's senatorial friend Lindsey Graham, who bragged to the rally in North Carolina that he would take on and beat swimmer Michael Phelps before Obama ever won the state - a brave wager, given that he cannot swim.</p> <p>But in reality there are some hard truths. That McCain devoted most of his final week to North Carolina, Florida and Ohio in itself told a story. All three were won by Bush in 2004 - and North Carolina has been solidly Republican since 1976 - so the deployment was purely defensive. Pennsylvania is the only state won four years ago by John Kerry in which McCain is still on the offensive.</p> <p>Then there is the extraordinary inequality in resources. Obama has poured more than $270m (\u00a3170m) into TV advertising - more than twice as much as McCain. Republicans are as aware of these disparities as anybody else. Interviews with loyalists in all three states uncovered intense anxieties that their 30-year dominance is about to be swept aside. Javier Souto, an elected official in south Florida, said he was concerned that the alliance that formed the base of the party was breaking up. \"The Democrats have been in disarray for many years. It's a pretty clear risk that the same could now happen to us,\" he said.</p> <p>Others were more intemperate. Christina Shores, a campaign volunteer in North Carolina, was born in Cork and raised in London; she emigrated to the US 20 years ago with her military husband and is now a naturalised American.</p> <p><strong>Scared to death</strong></p> <p>She said she was \"scared to death\" that Obama and the Democrats will win control of the of presidency, the house and the Senate. Then the next four years would see America transformed into a socialist state. \"I've never owned a gun. But I've told my husband that if Obama is elected, I want one in my house.\"</p> <p>Shores was one of many who were critical of McCain for being \"over-gentlemanly\" in his attacks on Obama urging him to go in harder over what they believe are his opponent's links with extreme-left politics and terrorism. \"I'm so upset,\" she said. \"Every night I watch the TV and I'm shouting at McCain: 'Come on! You've got to say something. Do something!'\"</p> <p>Palin has already let it be known she thinks the campaign has lacked bite. Others have accused McCain of lurching from issue to issue, like a signalman uncertain which lever to pull so he pulls them all. It is only in the past fortnight that he appears finally to have found the right lever, and as even he admits, that came about almost by chance. If Obama had not bumped into Samuel Wurzelbacher in Holland, Ohio, they would never have started a conversation in which the Democrat talked about his desire to \"spread wealth\", Wurzelbacher would not have morphed into Joe the Plumber and McCain would still be floundering, in search of his voice.</p> <p>\"Senator Obama is running to be distributionist-in-chief; I'm running to be commander-in-chief,\" he told crowds this week. \"Senator Obama is running to spread the wealth; I'm running to create more wealth.\"</p> <p>At every stop the response from the faithful was as identical as his words. \"Fight! Fight! Fight!\" they chanted. \"USA! USA! USA!\" By uttering that oldest of conservative war cries - the clash between the individual and society - McCain had at last engaged with their fears. </p> <p>But it has come so very late. The fight is almost over, the snapping all but done. Underdogs bear the name for a reason: they usually lose.</p>",

The Dales are on your doorstep for a blow-the-cobwebs-away yomp on New Year's Day.

Little has changed in 600 years: flagged floors, stone walls and heavy beams. Duck into the cosy darkness of this quirky bar to find low ceilings, a roaring fire, small booths and an old piano at the end of the room. Pretty bedrooms, all above, are a steal. Expect airy interiors, country rugs, wonky ceilings and well-dressed beds when you finally stagger up to bed after a New Year's Eve feast, with partying after if you fancy or a slurred chat around the bar into the early hours if you don't.</p> <p>\u2022 01722 714318, <a href=\"http://www.thecompassesinn.com\">thecompassesinn.com</a>; doubles from \u00a385 with dinner from \u00a325pp.</p> <p><strong>The Howard Arms, Warwickshire</strong></p> <p>The Howard stands on Illmington Green, five miles south of Stratford-upon-Avon; it was built at roughly the same time as Shakespeare wrote King Lear and relatively little has changed since - it's a fabulous country inn, one of the best. The old fixtures and fittings remain - polished flagstones, heavy beams, mellow stone walls - as logs crackle on a vast open fire and a blackboard menu scales the wall above. On New Year's Eve, it's \u00a3310 for a double, which includes a bottle of champagne in the room to get you in the mood, a four-course menu, party in the pub, and a civilised late check out with breakfast served until 1pm, including Bucks Fizz.</p> <p>\u2022 01608 682226, <a href=\"http://www.howardarms.com\">howardarms.com</a>.</p> <p><strong>The Griffin Inn, Sussex</strong></p> <p>A proper inn, a community local in Fletching, Uckfield, that draws a well-heeled and devoted crowd. The occasional touch of scruffiness makes it almost perfect. You get cosy open fires, 400-year-old beams, oak panelling, settles and red carpets. Bedrooms are tremendous value for money and full of uncluttered country-inn elegance with free-standing Victorian baths, huge shower heads, crisp linen - all of which will be most appreciated on New Year's Day after a night living it up at their Prohibition Party. The lively inn is liable to turn raucous when happy guests dressed in flapper dresses, pin stripes and trilbies will be feasting on four courses and then doing the charleston to a live band.</p> <p>\u2022 01825 722890, <a href=\"http://www.thegriffininn.co.uk\">thegriffininn.co.uk</a>; doubles from \u00a385 to \u00a3145, plus \u00a385 per ticket for the party.</p> <p><strong>The Westleton Crown, Suffolk</strong></p> <p>Situated in The Street, Westleton, near Southwold, this is one of England's oldest coaching inns, with 800 years of continuous service under its belt. Weave around the nooks and crannies and you'll find flames flickering in an open fire, leather sofas, a tongue-and-groove bar and a huge map on the wall for walkers. Come New Year's Eve you can drop in for the evening banquet; a five-course extravaganza with fish straight off the boats at Lowestoft and meat provided by local butchers.

This colonial manor house has just five rooms and two cottages, fronting a 1,000m-long white-sand beach lined with almond trees and sea grapes.

  "<p>Not so very long ago, Washington DC was regarded as America's \"murder capital\". It had an affluent white minority corralled in leafy north-western DC, while the rest of the city was mostly rundown and, the further south and east you went, frequently dangerous.</p> <p>The great \"Black Broadway\" of U Street, along with other African-American commercial neighbourhoods such as 14th Street and H Street, was burned down in the riots that followed the assassination of Martin Luther King in April 1968. For decades, all that replaced them were shuttered shops, vacant lots and, in the 1980s, crack dens. </p> <p>A new Metro station, creeping gentrification and proximity to northwest DC, mean that, for the past 10 years, U and 14th Streets have increasingly been studded with chichi furniture stores, hip bars and high-end galleries. But the latest district to arrive on the social map is across town on the H Street Corridor, behind Union Station in previously no-go northeast DC. </p> <p>In the past four years, around 90 new businesses have opened here, most following the lead of entrepreneur Joe Englert, who spotted the area's potential in 2002 and now owns six bars and restaurants on H Street. The city government has also decided the time is right for an H Street renaissance and is putting money into a new tram system and arts venues for the area. Until the credit crunch, developers were opening luxury condos nearby.</p> <p>Being a district on the cusp means there are still cheque-cashing businesses and liquor stores along H Street, and the Trinidad neighbourhood a few blocks away still sees the occasional shooting. Because there is no Metro line, several venues put on a shuttle bus from Union Station to encourage punters to visit on Friday and Saturday nights.</p> <h2>Dissident Display</h2> <p>DJ Adrian Loving and designers Eric Brewer and Ayo Okunseinde opened the Dissident Display gallery in 2006 to give a physical locale to their hepcat world of underground parties, daring sunglasses and online art musings. It specialises in contemporary film, painting and photography along with multimedia works, often with an African-American bent. The art often mingles with dance parties, and recent exhibitions have included a 25th anniversary celebration of the seminal hip-hop movie Wild Style. </p> <p>\u2022 416 H Street (001 202 332 3346, <a href=\"http://www.dissidentdisplay.com\">dissidentdisplay.com</a>)</p> <h2>Palace of Wonders</h2> <p>The first venues to rediscover H Street tended towards a tattoo-tastic clientele. The Palace of Wonders suited such punters down to the ground, being a kind of punk burlesque theatre and oddities museum with attached bar. On its two floors it hosts comedy, oddball vaudeville sword swallowers, fire jugglers and the like, as well as themed burlesque nights - think goth strippers - and assorted freakish sights.</p> <p>\u2022 1210 H Street (+202 398 7469, <a href=\"http://www.palaceofwonders.com\">palaceofwonders.com</a>)</p> <h2>Granville Moore's </h2> <p>Granville Moore was a local doctor who used to provide pro bono treatment to the district's poor. Now there's a Belgian-themed gastropub named after him. This restaurant, which opened in 2007, marks a departure in the development of H Street, in that although it's still minimally decorated with exposed brick and reclaimed furniture, it's more about food than drinking (although it does carry 80 Belgian beers). And it doesn't have a voodoo lounge/Chelsea Hotel/burlesque aesthetic, so you don't have to be pierced.</p> <p>\u2022 1238 H Street (+202 399 2546, <a href=\"http://www.granvillemoores.com\">granvillemoores.com</a>)</p> <h2>Rock &amp; Roll Hotel</h2> <p>If the Atlas Arts Center is the anchor tenant for H Street's highbrow revival, then the Rock &amp; Roll Hotel is the epicentre of the twenty- and thirtysomething underground scene that first rediscovered northeast DC. Don't be fooled by the name: it's not actually a hotel, so you can't stay there. Instead, this former funeral parlour is a live music venue - Glasvegas played there last month - with a capacity of 400 and a bar/restaurant. Upstairs there are lounges and practice spaces that can be hired by bands. There are shabby-chic antiques, a bordello-tinged room named after My Bloody Valentine and a presidential suite dedicated to the Ramones. </p> <p>\u2022 1353 H Street (+202 388 7625, <a href=\"http://www.rockandrollhoteldc.com\">rockandrollhoteldc.com</a>)</p> <h2>Atlas Performing Arts Center</h2> <p>In 2002, with the support of the DC city government, a non-profit community arts group bought a nice old 1930s art deco cinema complex that had been closed since 1976. More than US$20m was spent in a two-year renovation programme that produced four theatres, three dance studios, a cafe, and production and rehearsal spaces. The Atlas is home to the African Continuum Theatre Company and the Capital City Symphony as well as dance companies, choral groups and arts education programmes.</p> <p>\u2022 1333 H Street (+202 399 7993, <a href=\"http://www.atlasarts.org\">atlasarts.org</a>)</p> <h2>Sova Espresso &amp; Wine</h2> <p>You can tell which way a neighbourhood is going when its coffee shops start putting on sing-along live music for customers in (expensive) pushchairs. Thankfully, the \"Boogie Babies\" sets are strictly a morning thing. The rest of the time this cosy little coffee shop and wine bar is a daytime laptop-lounge hangout (it has free Wi-Fi) and a place to grab a pre-gig (it closes at 9pm) glass of wine or Californian microbrew.

  "<p>You thought it was all waltzes and wiener schnitzels? But Vienna is also about wine. More than that, Vienna is the only world capital with a serious wine industry. Within the city limits, Vienna boasts 700 beautiful, visitable hectares of vineyard and 320 wineries. Put these together with a new breed of forward-looking vintners, add in Austria's commitment to organic farming and the city's surprisingly affordable wine taverns, and you have my hot tip for Europe's coolest wine destination - and the perfect place for a festive tipple.</p> <p>As a city of classical culture, Vienna has it all, of course - symphony halls, opera houses and art galleries all dressed up in mighty architecture. Frau Koch, my informative (if arch) guide, walks me briskly through the Museum Quarter, talking of crown prince this and empress that. The sense of God-given power emanating from all these imperial statues and wedding cake edifices carries with it the stale whiff of pomp, designed to keep plebs like me in our place. </p> <p>At Schwarzenbergplatz, outside the Wiener von Welten Palace, there is a tiny vineyard. Here, Frau Koch informs me that a) the lord mayor is a socialist, and b) the socialist is also a winemaker: he ceremonially picks the grapes from this vineyard with his own egalitarian hands. The city also owns 35 hectares of prime vineyard in the bucolic 19th district, our next stop. </p> <p>After a 15-minute ride on the Green Line tram, and a short bus ride uphill, we are ready to start the 10km walk to Neustift am Walde. Along the way we will pass through the villages of Nussdorf, Sievering, Cobenzl and Grinzing. The Viennese wine region straddles both banks of the Danube. From up here in the hills, the forest and vines are clothed in autumn gold, and Vienna's vaulted sky is lapis lazuli blue. </p> <p>This afternoon, the Vienna hills are alive with the sound of Gore-Tex clad peripatetic wine drinkers. The city's spires, houses and towers are spread far below us like so much Enlightenment Lego. With its grassy inclines and wooded dips, the Wine Trail offers the opportunity for serious exercise, and also for serious drinking. What the bierhalle is to er, beer, the heurige (plural, heurigen) is to wine. Heurigen punctuate the Wine Trail every few hundred metres: there are hundreds of them all over the city as well. </p> <p>A heurige is always family-run, and exists to sell the wine produced by that family. You know when one is open by the bunch of pine branches displayed over its front door. In 1784, emperor Franz Josef decreed that winemakers be allowed to sell their own wine from home, and with food, too. You sit at a suitably rustic pine table, surrounded by, say, pairs of ice skates; old photos of whiskery men; whiskery old men with noses like pomegranates; antlers; amusing slogans describing how yesterday's inebriation does not remember today's thirst; or happy smiling people, sometimes with their dogs. Having bridled a bit at her pursed, prim city centre, I feel that in the heurigen I've found Vienna's blithe heart. </p> <p>Heurigen can hold anything from eight to 800 people. In the larger establishments, your waitress will be wearing a traditional dirndl-type arrangement and, invariably, a welcoming smile. You order heuriger (young white wine), alt from last year's harvest (if they have any), or the red, if you like thin, tart, acid wine. Many people around you will be drinking a spritzer, which is half heuriger, half soda water. A quarter litre of any of these is no more than \u20ac2.50, and usually a bit less. Quality ranges from very good to truly excellent. For a euro or two more, you choose from a huge array of real cheeses, meats and delicious fresh breads: many places also offer hot food like wiener schnitzel and, in November, roast goose and potatoes. </p> <p>The grape's harvest and pressing is celebrated around these parts in November, and from then until Christmas Day, heurigen are in full swing, as Vienna celebrates the season with dozens of Christmas markets. The most famous of these, outside the town hall, has been running since 1296 and is open daily until 9.30pm. Better, though, is to explore further afield: markets and Christmas \"villages\" spring up around the city in small squares, cul-de-sacs and alleys, where wooden huts dispense chilled white wine, hot punch and gl\u00fchwein, grilled sausages and sugared almonds. </p> <p>The village of Grinzing is famous for its heurigen, though some can be a bit coach-party. For an authentic large, multi-roomed heurige, head away from the main drag to Hengl-Haselbrunner (Iglaseegasse 10, 0043 1 320 3330, <a href=\"http://www.hengl-haselbrunner.at\">hengl-haselbrunner.at</a>). People have drunk wine here since 1683, and the church next door is where Beethoven realised he was going deaf. I get blind drunk.</p> <p>I also loved the cosy front-room homeliness of Gabriella and Friedl Schoell's place (Coblenzgasse 108, eccentric opening times - check first on +1 664 490 6391 and at <a href=\"http://www.buschenschankschoell.at\">buschenschankschoell.at</a>). Up an unassuming flight of steps, the Schoell's alcove seat also doubles as the wine press. Conversation flows readily between tables. This is lubricated by my hostess, Gabriella, and also in October and November by sturm, a semi-fermented new wine that tastes deliciously of sharp fruit juice, but has a kick like Arnold Schwarzenegger. Frau Koch and I spend happy hours drinking biodynamic sturm. Austria's dominant wine grape is gruner veltliner, known locally as gru-vee. More archduke than Rio, Vienna isn't groovy, but her wines are truly cool.</p> <p>\u2022 Rooms at Hotel Altstadt Vienna (+1 522 66 66, <a href=\"http://www.altstadt.at\">altstadt.at</a>) from \u20ac119 per night B&amp;B.

But if I dare to walk across her carpet with my shoes on, she'll raise a sardonic eyebrow and murmur: \"Christopher James Cleave!\" It's a tradition that my own children have seized on with gusto. This week, I was shouting back at some sophistry on the radio when our two-year-old picked up the remote control for the stereo, levelled it at my head and, with a grave expression, pressed \"pause\". I was so surprised that I stopped, my mouth frozen in mid-indignation. He then replaced the remote control gently on the kitchen table, pursed his lips in satisfaction and went back to eating his cereal. In the sudden silence you could hear every spoon-click and every crunch of his Coco Pops. Our five-year-old nodded in approval. He murmured: \"That's better, isn't it, Christopher James Cleave?\"</p> <p>My wife, once she had finished laughing, spent the rest of the week trying out the other remote control buttons on me. A favourite, it turns out, is \"rewind\". It's surprisingly fun. When my wife and I met, I was 26, carefree but sensible, and holding down a grown-up job. I only went feral after she married me. Now she presses \"rewind\" and I can pretend to be the man I was before I abandoned solid industry in favour of the speculative field of letters, stopped paying into a pension plan and hoped everything would turn out for the best. That was the dream. The reality now, it transpires, is that I'm not so much a self-employed person as a global recession in microcosm. I'm the credit crunch as one-man-band - look closely and you'll see I'm playing the IMF's part with cymbals strapped to the insides of my knees. When your bank account is empty and your kids are \"pausing\" you and your wife is \"rewinding\" you and you find yourself answering back at Radio 4, perhaps it's time to lend half an ear to what your family is trying to say.</p> <p>Khalil Gibran famously wrote \"Your children are not your children.\" He was lucky to be writing in the days before DNA testing could refute such a claim, but even today his words have a certain figurative power. \"You may house their bodies, but not their souls,\" he wrote - or in other words, your children will answer back. I certainly heard mine loud and clear this week. And I'm not talking about Tuesday, when our two-year-old emptied his potty over the banisters because he wanted to \"look how far poo-poo go down stair\". Even on a figurative level, I failed to find poetry in that. </p> <p>And I don't think even Khalil would have enjoyed Thursday, when my five-year-old shouted, \"Why is that fat woman fat?\" in the queue for the bus. (If Khalil had been with us at the bus stop, I might have pretended my children were his.) No, the favour my children did me was to \"pause\" me over the breakfast table. Once I'd got over the shock, I started to get over myself. Perhaps there are things it's only possible to hear from people who don't yet have the words to say them. And maybe Khalil Gibran did have a point when he wrote of our children that \"You may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you.\" OK, so he was a wise man - but I bet his mum still called him by his full name when he was in trouble. \"Gibran Khalil Gibran bin Mikha'il bin Sa'ad,\" I can hear her saying, \"don't you dare walk across my nice carpet with your shoes on!\"</p>",
  "<p>The bad news is that the value of your pension has been hammered by the stockmarket. But the really bad news is that after you've done your best to build up savings for retirement, you're forced into buying an \"annuity\" - and these are now being hammered by falling interest rates. </p> <p>Even if you build up a \u00a3100,000 pension pot, it translates into a paltry annuity - that's a monthly income for life - when you retire. A man aged 65 will swap \u00a3100,000 for an income for the rest of his life of just \u00a34,749 (with annual retail price increases). Even without RPI increases, the best annuity would pay around \u00a37,800 a year. And if he dies the very next day, the insurance company keeps the lot. You can't avoid them either; the law requires that a pension pot must be turned into an annuity by age 75. </p> <p>Annuity rates have halved since the early 1990s, as interest rates have fallen and we all continue to live longer. The fear now is that they will crash even further, if the Bank of England chops interest rates to as low as 3% over the next year. \"In the short term we feel that the pressures are universally downward,\" says pension adviser Tom McPhail of Hargreaves Lansdown. He thinks annuity rates could easily slide by about a tenth over the next year. The outlook may be even bleaker for people still some way from retirement. </p> <p>Annuity rates reflect expectations on longevity. As we all live longer (male longevity is improving much faster than female) annuity rates will fall further and further. So what can you do? </p> <p><strong>Don't buy a pension, buy property </strong>This has been the mantra of buy-to-let investors over the past decade. Once the mortgage is paid off, property can provide a rental (although taxable) income in retirement and the capital remains in your hands. Putting aside ethical considerations, the early buyers are still doing well. But with many recent ones now in negative equity, the promise of easy returns has evaporated. However, with property prices falling fast, new investors who can find a lender willing to grant a loan may be in a better position.</p> <p><strong>Defer taking your pension</strong> Annuity rates improve dramatically the longer you put off buying. Standard rates rise by about one-third if you wait until 75 before being forcibly herded into one, while those RPI-protected gain by about half. The drawback is you've got to eat between ages 65 and 75, and the basic state pension (currently \u00a390.70 a week for a single, \u00a3145.05 for a couple) might not quite be enough.</p> <p><strong>Work longer</strong> This is only an option if your company allows you, and you're healthy enough, to continue. Recent court cases have established that companies can force employees to retire at their \"normal retirement date\" of 65, despite anti-ageism legislation. Companies are required to consider a request for continued working, but can reject it without giving reasons.</p> <p><strong>Shop around</strong> It is almost criminal how many people with company money purchase/DC schemes simply take the (often poor value) annuity on offer from their savings provider. Shopping around for a better rate can improve your monthly income by as much as 10% for the rest of your life. Brokers worth trying include Annuity Bureau (0845 602 6263 or annuity-bureau.co.uk); Annuity Direct (0500 50 65 75 or annuitydirect.co.uk); or Hargreaves Lansdown (0117 980 9940 or h-l.co.uk/pensions/annuities). </p> <p><strong>Consider 'drawdown' </strong>These policies keep your pension money invested after you've retired, enabling the money to grow. But there's a risk the stock market will continue to fall - and annuity rates worsen. An alternative is \"phased\" retirement. Say you have \u00a3100,000. At 65 you buy an annuity for \u00a310,000, at 66, another for \u00a310,000, and so on. The rest stays invested.</p> <p><strong>Consider US-style \"variable annuities\" </strong>They're big over there and now they're arriving here, sold by companies such as MetLife, Hartford, Living Time and Lincoln. They leave your money invested, but unlike \"drawdown\" give you guarantees about the value of your investments at 75. And if you die, your estate/spouse gets your capital. But advisers warn they can be pricey, with charges of 2.5% a year or more.</p> <p><strong>Eat, drink, smoke, divorce, become an atheist and move to Glasgow</strong> You receive a higher income if the provider thinks you'll die early. The most common \"enhanced\" annuities are for smokers and the obese. There are postcode-based annuities - Glasgow has the UK's lowest life expectancy. Unmarried people live shorter lives, and the non-religious die earlier than the religious.</p> <p><strong>Vote Tory</strong> Have we ever recommended this in Guardian Money before? If the rule requiring annuitisation by age 75 incenses you, then vote Conservative. Labour's keen to keep it, but the Tories say they'll abolish it.</p>",
  "<p>Toni Morrison breaks off from explaining a crucial passage in her new novel - Florens, the main character, has just been searched by a posse of witch-hunters - to check her mobile. \"It's my son,\" she apologises, \"is he kidding me?\" She calls him back for a quick discussion about the latest presidential election headlines. </p> <p>\"We're gonna have such fun!\" she exclaims afterwards. She will watch Tuesday night's TV coverage with friends, she says excitedly, but her assessment of what an Obama presidency might mean is measured: \"It would be good, it would be interesting, it would have an impact, I think.\" Morrison famously described Bill Clinton as \"the first black president\" (\"I said he was treated like a black man, and he was, but anyway they ... what can I say? Nuance is not a strong point\"), and took her time in coming round to Obama. \"I didn't know him,\" she says. \"I knew Hillary. I really, really liked her and for years admired her.\" The first time Obama called and asked for her support she said no, but \"we chatted for quite a while\". In January she changed her mind and wrote a letter of endorsement that glowed with praise for his \"wisdom\". </p> <p>A Mercy, Morrison's first book in five years, is published in the UK on Thursday, and is released in the US a few days later. Though publishing schedules are fixed months in advance and production of the book must have been well under way by the time Barack Obama was finally selected as the Democratic candidate, the timing is surely no accident. </p> <p>In A Mercy, the 77-year-old Nobel laureate writes directly about American slavery for the first time since her celebrated 1987 novel Beloved. Though A Mercy is a very different book - around half the length, more episodic than epic, set in the 17th century rather than the 19th - it is billed by her publisher as a companion piece, or \"prelude\". Morrison says the new work is an attempt to separate racism from slavery, \"to see how it was constructed, planted deliberately in order to protect the ruling class\" from the \"unpaid labour\" on which their new civilisation and wealth depended. So as the US looks set to elect an African-American president, its pre-eminent African-American writer delivers her own vision of America uncorrupted - or only beginning to be corrupted - by racial thinking. </p> <p>Morrison's great achievement, in a career spanning four decades and nine novels, has been to combine deep psychological insight with a vigorous and original critique of American history. \"My books are always questions for me. What if? How does it feel to ...? Or what would it look like if you took racism out? Or what does it look like if you have the perfect town, everything you ever wanted? And so you ask a question, put it in a time when it would be theatrical to ask, and find the people who can articulate it for you and try to make them interesting. The rest of it is all structure, how to put it together.\" </p> <p>In her debut, The Bluest Eye (1970), written in the early mornings while she was working full-time and raising two sons in New York, Morrison crafted a highly literary fiction out of the interior lives of poor black girls growing up in her hometown of Lorain, Ohio. Sula (1973) told a story of female friendship, partly inspired by her own life as a single mother and a more complex, ambivalent view of \"sisterhood\" than many in the feminist movement would then allow, while Song of Solomon (1977) took its alienated protagonist, \"Milkman\", on a voyage of discovery to the deep south.</p> <p>But with Beloved, her prizewinning novel set in the aftermath of abolition, Morrison hurled herself at the legacy of slavery and the 20th-century American literary canon head-on. Inspired by a newspaper cutting she found while editing an African-American history anthology, The Black Book, and audaciously weaving together realist, modernist and supernatural elements, it tells the story of a runaway slave who, rather than give up her children when her former owners come looking for her, cuts her daughter's throat.</p> <p>It is a novel of unspeakable horrors. But even more than the physical brutality, Morrison confronts us with the irreparable harm done by what Margaret Atwood described in a review as \"one of the most viciously antifamily institutions human beings have ever devised\", a system that sought to deprive human beings of what it is that makes them human.</p> <p>\"We were very keenly involved in the culture of African America, so of course slavery was back there,\" Morrison says of her upbringing in the midwest, \"yet the pressure was not to remember it, but to get over it. So when I was writing Beloved, part of the architecture was the act of forgetting.\" When Beloved failed to win the National Book Award, a group of 48 African-American critics and writers including Maya Angelou and Alice Walker wrote to the New York Times praising Morrison, and the novel won the Pulitzer soon afterwards. Morrison herself is alert to the ways in which black and women's writing have been patronised and excluded from the mainstream, and after winning the Nobel in 1993 she wrote that she felt she had earned a \"licence to strut\". </p> <p>Her novels found an influential champion in Oprah Winfrey, who chose four of them for her book club, ensuring huge sales. Winfrey also produced and starred in the 1998 film of Beloved, directed by Jonathan Demme. Morrison's response to critics who suggest her canvas is too narrow is to cite Joyce and Dostoevsky: no one complains that Joyce always writes about the Irish, or Dostoevsky about Russia. She projects a formidable self-belief, but the impression of imperiousness is offset by her soft voice and almost girlish manner.</p> <p>A few years ago she bought a house on Princeton's main street, a long straight avenue with the university campus on one side and a parade of colonial-style architecture, bookshops and ice-cream parlours on the other. She has done the top floor up for her two grand-daughters, as \"classical little girls' rooms with all the pillows ... I know it's just a luxury but I had such fun.\" The contrast to her own childhood in Ohio could hardly be greater. \"There were factories there, shipyards, steel mills, and people came from all over to work,\" she says. The town was not segregated along racial lines - \"Mrs Gallini lived next door and the Terschaks on the other side, that's the way it was and I thought the whole world was like that.\" Both her parents' families migrated north to escape poverty. </p> <p>Morrison, who was born Chloe Anthony Wofford in 1931 - Toni was the nickname she took as a student, Morrison is her ex-husband - had two younger brothers and an older sister. Her father worked as a welder, but \"after the war began, my parents had less and less, and their conflicts were the conflicts poor people have.\" </p> <p>In The Bluest Eye, Morrison depicts Lorain as a town cruelly stratified along class and caste lines. Homelessness, or \"being outdoors\", is \"the real terror of life\", and while Pecola Breedlove is doomed by her perception of her own ugliness, the more spirited Claudia is frightened by urges to harm the \"little white girls\" whom even black women seem to prefer to their own daughters. Morrison has said she would have brought up her sons differently had she anticipated the poisonous race relations of the 1980s, but of her own youth she says she \"felt like an aristocrat\", and when I ask if she remembers when recognition of her own blackness dawned, wondering whether she too suffered from feelings of rage or insecurity, she fires back: \"That's not the question, the question is when you first understand you're white.\" </p> <p>But on the lessons of the past her parents were deeply divided: \"My father never trusted any white person at all, would not let them in his house, insurance people and so on. Luckily my mother was entirely different, she was always judging people one at a time. My mother talked about her childhood in the south - she left when she was about six - as if it was the most wonderful, romantic, nostalgic, lovely [memory]. And my father talked about it in diametrically opposed ways. But he went back every year to this place he hated [Georgia], while my mother never went back to Alabama, the place she loved.\"</p> <p>Such conflicts recur in her novels, which dig away at rather than paper over the cracks in the African-American story, exposing divisions of religion, politics, class and gender. She chose to go to the traditionally black Howard College in Washington DC because she \"wanted to be around black intellectuals\", and has sought to explore the compromises and sacrifices as well as the triumphs of integration. Her novel Paradise (1998) is a brutal fable of what happens when the dream of an all-black community turns sour, while Love (2003) mourns the ruin of an African-American entrepreneur's dream: an upmarket black holiday resort crumbling into the sea. </p> <p>She edited books about the controversies surrounding OJ Simpson's trial for murder and the appointment of Clarence Thomas to the supreme court, while her criticism has drawn attention to the racial themes of such classics as Moby-Dick and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. African religion, medicine and stories are shown to have vivid meaning for Morrison's characters, but she has never been to Africa: \"something always happened or I couldn't get there\". In Beloved, Stamp Paid reflects that \"Whitepeople believed that whatever the manners, under every dark skin was a jungle. Swift unnavigable waters, swinging screaming baboons, sleeping snakes, red gums ready for their sweet white blood.\" But there are black racists in her books too, who believe whites are subhuman, devils.</p> <p>With its focus on a time before the slave system, A Mercy confirms Morrison's determination to think beyond racial categories. The novel sets out to blur the lines and its characters include indentured servants, slaves, a Dutchwoman sold into marriage (whose filthy voyage is the closest Morrison has come to writing about the slave ships) and a free black man. She also writes from the point of view of a white slave owner for the first time, and when I ask whether she and others are now moving towards a \"post-racial\" literary discourse - in a parallel development to what commentators have described as Obama's \"post-racial\" politics - she concurs, before offering the qualifier that \"you have to walk that line, you don't want the culture de-raced\". </p> <p>But she agrees that the emphasis placed on race by critics has meant that other aspects of her writing have received less attention. The questions she asks in her books have deep ethical and philosophical dimensions. What is love? Can a woman recover from having killed her baby? What does it mean to be forgiven? Like Beloved, the new novel springs from the action of a mother, a slave who gives her daughter away to a different master in the belief that he will be kinder, but when I say what a terribly sad story it seemed to me - Florens is desperately hurt, and then rejected again by her first lover - I am briskly corrected: \"No, no no! Think about her, she was completely needy, yearning, selfless, 'my life is in you, I can't live without you'.\" The heartbreak of the novel, in its author's view, teaches its protagonist a lesson: \"do not give yourself over completely to anybody. At least you know she'll never do that again.\"</p> <p>Morrison calls Jazz (1992), a love story set in 1920s Harlem and narrated in such a way that the book itself speaks in the first person, her \"best book\" in terms of the technical obstacles she set herself. She relished the challenge of 17th-century dialogue posed by A Mercy, and describes her experiments with vocabulary and tenses. She has been reunited with her original editor, Robert Gottlieb, a former New Yorker editor and her exact contemporary. </p> <p>She has never got over her house in Rockland County, New York, burning down in 1993: \"My books and manuscripts I couldn't care less about, but my children's report cards ... There's a picture of my son shooting a basketball into the sky and it's gone.\" But she jokes that at least she won the Nobel prize that year as well, and has made an anecdote out of the fact that, for a long time, she could talk only to other people who had suffered house fires. (\"Maxine Hong Kingston - she and I were on the phone every day!\") </p> <p>The prospect of a book tour is more daunting than it once was, and she hopes her son Ford will join her on this one. But she has two more book projects already in mind, one of which promises a departure. Only once before, with Tar Baby (1981), has she set a story in the present, and that was in the Caribbean, but she says \"I've got sketches which are very much now\". </p> <p>For 40 years she has written of passionately experienced sexuality, and every possible permutation of family. Her early marriage to Harold Morrison, an architect from Jamaica with whom she had her two sons, lasted only six years, and she has rarely discussed it. When I ask whether she would have liked to remarry, she bats away the question with a \"no, no, no\", and she dismisses the idea that she might ever write her memoirs: \"It's just not interesting, my life is not adventurous ... The life of the mind is interesting, but all these other little foibles? Please.\"</p> <p>Morrison's family still call her Chloe, and she has often said that her pen name of Toni Morrison was a kind of accident. She says that when her father died, she was upset that she hadn't kept the name Wofford, and tells a story about a talk she gave in England where a young black woman in the audience asked her how she wanted to be remembered. \"I said as an honest, trustworthy person - I think I even put humour in there. And the girl said 'What do you mean? You just won the Nobel prize and you want to be remembered as a trustworthy person?' And I didn't know what to say. I was talking about how I want to be remembered by my family. Do I want to be remembered by my sons as a writer who won the Nobel prize? There's a persona, Toni Morrison, and there's me, Chloe. They were asking Toni Morrison and I answered as Chloe.\" </p> <p>But she is in no doubt as to what enabled her transformation from one into the other. \"My sons needed me to be real, to know what I was doing, you know? When people say they don't have time to write with small children, well, for me it was the opposite. I didn't write anything before I had them. They gave me that.\"</p> <h2>Morrison on Morrison</h2> <p>\"I walk alone except for the eyes that join me on my journey. Eyes that do not recognise me, eyes that examine me for a tail, an extra teat, a man's whip between my legs. Wondering eyes that stare and decide if my navel is in the right place if my knees bend backward like the forelegs of a dog. They want to see if my tongue is split like a snake's or if my teeth are filing to points to chew them up. To know if I can spring out of the darkness and bite. Inside I am shrinking. I climb the streambed under watching eyes and know I am not the same. I am losing something with every step I take. I can feel the drain. Something precious is leaving me. I am a thing apart. With the letter I belong and am lawful. Without it I am a weak calf abandon by the herd, a turtle without shell, a minion with no telltale signs but a darkness I am born with, outside, yes, but inside as well and the inside dark is small, feathered and toothy. Is that what my mother knows? Why she chooses me to live without?\"</p> <p>At this point Florens has already had the first sense of self-loathing, where the people say they associate blackness with Satan, and after they've examined her body she feels like a different species under their gaze. Something has died in her, and everything looks like it's looking at her in that hostile way. The trees are looking at her, everything. And she's thinking if they are looking at her because she's black, and finding that a problem and possibly evil and satanic, then it's something she has to think about. Now that she's by herself, she thinks maybe they mean there's something inside of me that really is bad and maybe they're right? It's the crumbling of the psyche.</p>",
  "<h2>By my calculations, I've lost \u00a33,000</h2> <p>I had a Portman mortgage which came under Nationwide's control after the merger. In March 2008, I reduced the loan with a payment of \u00a3170,000 on the basis that I could draw it back later if necessary. I also carried on making monthly payments at the old level. Three months later, in June 2008, I borrowed the \u00a3170,000 back again, returning my mortgage to its former level.</p> <p>I followed instructions to the letter, including a complex transfer to a Nationwide loan, but Nationwide has not credited my account with the three-month interest reduction which I work out at more than \u00a33,000. Every time I call Nationwide, it says it is still calculating my refund.<br><strong>JG London </strong></p> <p>You have been trying since June to find how much you have saved by drawing down \u00a3170,000, with much of the problem caused by incompatability between old Portman loans and those offered by Nationwide - only the latter have a drawdown facility. </p> <p>It would have helped if Nationwide had given you correct information in the first place. It would have helped further if the telegraphic transfer you made in mid March had not taken eight days to arrive. </p> <p>It would have been even more helpful if Nationwide dealt with you in a timely manner. </p> <p>This should not have been difficult for the world's biggest building society to calculate - after all, you have sent a spreadsheet showing you are owed more than \u00a33,000.</p> <p>Since you approached Capital Letters, you have received a very apologetic letter from Nationwide. It admits you received wrong drawdown information, and regrets staff failed to adhere to promised timescales.</p> <p>It has promised to refund \u00a32,938 as an interest refund, and it will send you \u00a3250 in compensation. But it may still have underestimated the interest by \u00a3167. It is recalculating.</p> <h2>Marbles' attitude to spending is the limit</h2> <p>I have a Marbles credit card used often for small amounts (and occasionally for \u00a31,000 travel tickets). HFC Bank, which owns Marbles, told me on the phone that as I don't run up sufficient debt on my card, and also pay it off every month, my credit limit is to be cut from \u00a37,000 to \u00a3150 under its \"responsible lending policy\". I complained that this limit made the card effectively useless, so I was given until November 17 to run up enough debt on my card to make me reconsider! Please help.<br><strong>TT, Hampshire </strong></p> <p>You have been a responsible borrower but not a profitable one, and the \u00a3150 limit is Marbles' way of getting you to give up the card. If you were less responsible, you could keep the card. </p> <p>When Capital Letters called, Marbles stopped talking of \"responsible lending\", saying \"it reviews credit limits to ensure that they are closely aligned with customer needs\". You may not need \u00a37,000, but \u00a3150 is a nonsense. HFC also claimed limiting your limit reduced \"exposure to fraudulent transactions\". But this is inconsistent with encouraging you to spend more. But our intervention has been positive. It has agreed to \"amend the limit back\" to a level that suits your needs. This has been settled at \u00a33,500.</p> <h2>Can I bring this publisher to book?</h2> <p>In March, I was persuaded by Educational Support Publications (ESP) in Manchester to pay \u00a399 for 10 books on personal safety which were intended to be a gift from my business to a local school - they would have my business name on them. I was unimpressed with the \u00a39.90 books but left it at that.</p> <p>Now it says I have made a \"verbal order\" for 40 \"safety awareness\" books and has invoiced me for \u00a3249. I did not order these but it ignores my protests and is now threatening to take me to court. What should I do?<br><strong>CH, Bradford</strong></p> <p>ESP, owned by Ikonic Publications, last appeared in this column in July when a Bournemouth reader had a similar problem. </p> <p>Ikonic claims to have a taped conversation of your order which it will need to produce should it go to court. You should demand a copy of this for checking by your own expert.</p> <p>Ikonic was set up in October 2007 by Andrew Bates, its sole director, after his resignation as a director of Carroll-Dillon Publishing, which specialised in selling high-cost leaflets on \"good causes\" to small businesses.</p> <p>In Ireland, Carroll-Dillon published a drugs book deemed \"totally unsuitable\" by the Irish National Teachers Organisation. The firm paid for Bates' brother, Ian Bates, to stay in a luxury Dublin hotel in 2006. Ian Bates was convicted at Manchester Crown Court in 2002 of conspiracy to defraud by selling adverts in an anti-drug book, aimed at school children, through Fullerton Publications, which he controlled. Andrew Bates is also a director of Core Media Services which sells pricey leaflets for schools on drug and other issues. Companies House is now proposing to strike off Core Media. </p> <p>In July, Capital Letters told the Bournemouth reader to call Ikonic's bluff by demanding it take him to court. It has failed to do so.</p> <h2>Counting the cost of being left a widower</h2> <p>In 2007-08, I paid \u00a36.90 a month tax on my small income. But now I have to pay \u00a359.80 a month. Why?<br><strong>JT, West Midlands </strong></p> <p>Your wife passed away last November which meant you have now lost both your married persons' tax allowance, and your late wife's personal allowance. When one partner dies, the other's income falls, even though costs may remain almost unchanged.</p> <h2>So who needs the \u00a312 more, you or NatWest?</h2> <p>I am a student with a NatWest credit card which has a \u00a3500 limit. Last month I accidentally went \u00a320 over that limit and incurred a pound;12 fine. </p> <p>I accepted this, put it down to experience, and paid off the card in full. But this month I received another \u00a312 fine because I was still over my limit at the start of the new month although I had no way of knowing I had overreached the \u00a3500 because the bill had not arrived. Is this fair?<br><strong>OL, Middlesex </strong></p> <p>Capital Letters asked NatWest on two occasions how this extra charge (you are not complaining about the first) complied with the Financial Services Authority requirement to treat customers fairly. </p> <p>The bank did not answer either request. But, quoting \"terms and conditions\" it advised: \"The cardholder can avoid the second charge by checking their account more frequently online, over the phone or at an ATM machine and making the necessary payment as soon as possible to bring them back within the agreed credit arrangement.\" </p> <p>Capital Letters asked how the second charge could be avoided if a holder went over limit at the end of a charging period, given it would be impossible to pay the extra in time to prevent a second \u00a312 fee. Again, it did not answer.</p> <p>Of course, its advice is helpful - if NatWest parent Royal Bank of Scotland had checked its affairs and credit agreements more frequently, the bank might not have needed a \u00a320bn taxpayer-funded rescue. You now conclude the bank needs \u00a312 more than you.</p>",
  "<p>This startling, short book by the mercurial Michel Faber is basically The Da Vinci Code with gags - and bile.

The papyrus scrolls turn out to be a fifth gospel, an account by Malchus of the last days of Jesus. Unlike the other gospels, Malchus's is a vivid, first-hand account. Malchus was in the garden of Gethsemane; Malchus it is at the foot of the cross. Before he can say \"Hallelujah, praise the Lord\", Theo secures himself a publishing deal, and has an overnight sensation on his hands. </p> <p>Parts of the novel consist of long quoted passages from Theo's translation of the gospel of Malchus - \"I wanted to strike a balance between the no-nonsense directness of the original Aramaic and the sort of weird Elizabethan-Hebrew hybrid that people are used to from the King James\". The upshot of the gospel is that Jesus was not the Messiah: he was a potent symbol, or totem, for a bunch of very determined, possibly half-crazy, drug-taking followers. And His last words on the cross were not \"It is finished\" but \"Please, somebody, please finish me.\"</p> <p>So far, so Da Vinci. What raises and lightens the novel is Faber's exploration of the consequences of literary fame and notoriety. First, Theo is persuaded to change his name by his publisher, Baum: \"Baum had convinced him that 'Theo Griepenkerl' was a problem for customers and booksellers; the chances of somebody misspelling it in a search engine, or failing to remember it in the first place, were too high. 'Grippin' was nice and simple, yet distinctive enough to stand out in a crowded marketplace.\" Grippin' indeed. Theo's book begins to outsell even \"the latest bestsellers about sexy criminologists, celebrity footballers, lovable drug addicts, conspiracy theories, and the national trauma of 9/11 refracted with unbearable poignancy through a literary fable about an anorexic New York teenager and her imaginary friend Kuki\". But of course it's not enough for him. He becomes the classic bitter and enraged author, staying up late at night to check online Amazon reviews from saddoes like Boyd Benes from Toledo (\"Save your money, this one is a big letdown\"), and Arnold P Lynch (\"Check out the book's ISBN number: 1+3+2 66 = 666\").</p> <p>Things gets better. Theo hooks up with an \"alpha female\" editor from his publishing house who is not only beautiful and smart, but also \"genuinely au fait with the controversial provenance of John Coltrane's Stellar Regions\". He's hit pay-dirt. \"This is what a No 1 bestseller did for you. This is what you earned along with the money.\"</p> <p>Finally, Faber's satire becomes farce as Theo's fame and notoriety catch up with him in shocking fashion. The book's conclusion is perhaps less compelling than everything that goes before, but Faber is an author so genuinely daring, so odd, so dark and so funny that you can forgive him, like Malchus, when he gets a little bit carried away. </p> <p>\u2022 Ian Sansom's The Delegates' Choice is published by Harper Perennial.

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/sir-alex-ferguson\">Sir Alex Ferguson</a> has given his vision of the future of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague\">Premier League</a> football, outlining a plan for a winter break and the introduction of technology to aid officials.</p> <p>Foremost among Ferguson's proposals is a break which would see a starvation diet of football played throughout January and the league season extended until the end of May. \"I've thought long and hard about this and I have a plan,\" he explained. \"You could keep the Christmas fixtures as they are but stagger one round of 10 league matches throughout January.</p> <p>\"Three games could be played on the first weekend, another three on the next weekend and the final four on the third weekend. TV broadcasters wouldn't lose out because they can show matches each weekend - and players could rest,\" Ferguson said in an article for Inside United, the club's official magazine.</p> <p>\"Also, last season the league finished on May 11. Why can't we extend it until the end of that month and take two weeks off in January? The weather is better in May and there's no issue with worn-out pitches in modern football. Will it ever happen? Well, I've been talking about a winter break ever since I came down to England, 22 years ago ... but the people in charge still think football is a winter game.\"</p> <p>Although a great traditionalist and acutely aware of the game's history, Ferguson has also called for video replays and goalline technology to be introduced. \"The argument against it - that it would take too long and cause too many stoppages in the game - doesn't stand up,\" he said. \"Matches already have many interruptions when the ball goes out of play and for throw-ins, plus goalkeepers often take their time over goal-kicks.</p> <p>\"I remember a game against Everton at Old Trafford, many years ago, and Neville Southall must have wasted 10 minutes over the course of the match. So to say technology would waste time is a bit rich.The fourth official could watch a TV replay in the amount of time it takes for the referee to run across to the touchline and find out the verdict on an incident. It would take less than a minute.\"</p> <p>Diego Maradona, Argentina's national team coach in waiting, is reportedly considering a visit to Old Trafford to check on Carlos Tevez's form against Hull City today - but the forward may not play. Ferguson said yesterday that Tevez is struggling to accept the rotation policy which has seen him start only four league games this season. Tevez, who started but was unimpressive in midweek against West Ham, is currently in negotiations with United to make the his loan move permanent.</p> <p>\"Obviously there is always that language barrier with Carlos,\" said Ferguson. \"I've had a couple of discussions and it's quite straightforward. He wants to play and that's great. I've reminded him how we operate, the same with [Wayne] Rooney. He understands but it doesn't mean to say he's happy. It's going to be that way, there will be no change in policy. He's happy here, the players love him, the fans love him, there is absolutely no reason because he has been left out a couple of games why that should be a negative part of the [contract] negotiations to get him here full-time.\"</p> <p>Tevez partnered Dimitar Berbatov against West Ham but his performance did little to convince the manager that this was his preferred pairing. \"On Wednesday, I wanted to see how the combination of Tevez and Berbatov was together,\" Ferguson said. \"But I think Carlos was so wound up to do well himself that they became two separate parts.\"</p> <p>The manager's volatile relationship with Real Madrid and their president, Ram\u00f3n Calder\u00f3n, again came under spotlight yesterday. Calder\u00f3n used a Madrid-based newspaper to brand Ferguson \"senile\" after the United manager brought up Real's historical links with Franco. \"He has a few strange things to say every week,\" Ferguson said of Calder\u00f3n: \"A lot of hot air comes out of that man and I'm not going to get involved in it. I think he is very disappointed not to get Ronaldo and I'm delighted to say he is still here.\"</p>",
  "<p>In 1934 documentary film-maker Robert Flaherty made a short film about the fishermen of the wild Aran islands, off the coast of Galway. Man Of Aran portrayed the hardship of the everyday lives of the men struggling to survive and earn a living in a place where the sea and landscape seemed to be constantly against them. It's against the background of the making of Flaherty's Hollywood film that Martin McDonagh sets his 1997 story, a fictional account of life in a small village where everyone is stunted and crippled by circumstance. A far less romantic account than Flaherty's of the daily grind of survival, McDonagh's savage work gets the savage production it deserves by director Garry Hynes for Druid Theatre Company. This revival, which heads to Oxford next week, reveals the play as the real diamond in the dirt that it is.</p> <p>\u2022 An Grian\u00e1n Theatre, Letterkenny, Sat 1; The Lowry, Tue 4 to Nov 8</p>"
