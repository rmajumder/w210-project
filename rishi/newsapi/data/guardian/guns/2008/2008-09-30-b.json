  "<p><strong>\"Considering the strife of certain top-flight sponsors, have there been any instances of a sponsor leaving a club in the lurch with disastrous consequences?\"</strong> wondered Mike Hulse, a week or two ago.</p> <p>XL's demise has caused West Ham some trouble and strife, with the possibility of a \u00a330m payout over the Carlos Tevez affair compounding the financial implications of the travel company's collapse. The Hammers, though, are not alone. In fact, they're in rather good company.</p> <p>Real Madrid lost their sponsor BenQ after the company went bankrupt during the 2006/07 season, just over a year into a five-year deal. The Spanish giants, however, aren't short of a couple of quid, rode out their troubles, and signed a new \u20ac60m deal with gambling company Bwin at the end of the season.</p> <p>Parma, Cup Winners' Cup winners in 1993, Uefa Cup winners in 1995 and 1999, faced financial ruin after the Parmalat scandal broke in Italy. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/jan/11/football.italy\">The ruin of the Tanzi family</a> and of the club led to a player exodus, with Alberto Gilardino among those leaving, and the side went from top-half contender to a relegation battler, a fight that they finally lost last season.</p> <p>In England Charlton Athletic have led the way in backing the wrong horses in the advertising stakes. When their shirt sponsors all:sports went into administration in September 2005, the Addicks signed up with Spanish property company Llanera, who proceeded to go to bust 2\u00bd years into a 4\u00bd-year \u00a36.6m deal. Llanera still advertise their links with the south London club on their crumbling, spiderweb-strewn <a href=\"http://www.llanerainmobiliaria.com/enlaces/charlton.htm\">website</a>.</p> <p>And Nick Byrne, not unreasonably, points to the turmoil caused by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/aug/02/broadcasting.citynews\">collapse of ITV Digital</a>.

The stream of tales of footballing philanrthropy shows no sign of drying up.</p> <p>This week's most impressive suggestion comes from Oliver Jordanovski. \"Check on Per Mertersacker of Werder Bremen,\" writes Oliver. \"He commits both time and money to fight poverty. I hear he spends one day a week doing menial jobs for shelters, charities, etc.\"</p> <p>We did check and though we couldn't find any corroborating evidence for such largesse, <a href=\" http://www.permertesacker.de/\">his official website</a> confirms he has done volunteer work in a \"closed institution for the mentally completed\" (according to our ropey online translation). We also found passage that translated as \"I do not find that I am a girl swarm\", which we feel it is necessary to share.</p> <p>\"Due honor has to be given to Javier \"Pupi\" Zanetti, the Argentinean player,\" writes Juan Carlos Guataqui. \"Together with his wife they run the <a href=\"http://www.fundacionpupi.org/v.2003ing/aplaceforsolidarity.htm\">Pupi Foundation</a>, a very well-known charity for poor children. Zanetti has organized exhibition matches with famous players and usually puts in auction the shirts that he gets on exchange at the end of his matches.\" Also with his own charity is Liverpool's Dirk Kuyt. <a href=\"http://www.dirkkuytfoundation.nl\">The Dirk Kuyt foundation</a> helps support and organise sports for people with disabilities.<br> As Alex Warwick and Sean Galvin write to tell us, Redondo was unable to play due to injury for more than two years after signing for Milan in 2000. He suspended his \u00a32.74m-a-year salary and also, apparently, tried to give back the house and car that the Rossoneri had presented him.</p> <p>In a less spectacular but no less meaningful example, Kris Boyd, according to Fraser Mann, \"waived half of his \u00a340,000 signing on fee\" after his move to Rangers, helping to fund the Kilmarnock youth set-up that helped further his own career. And, finally, in a similar vein to Niall Quinn, Gary Kelly also donated the entire proceeds of his Leeds United testimonial to charity. \"His sister had died from cancer and the proceeds went to various cancer charities and hospices in Ireland and Leeds,\" wrires Owen Lennard. The proceeds also went towards the creation of the <a href=\"http://www.gkcancersupport.com/\">Gary Kelly Cancer Support Centre</a> in Drogheda.</p> <p><strong>CHINA'S (1948) OLYMPIC ADVENTURE</strong></p> <p><strong>My late uncle was a footballer playing for pre-communist China. He always boasted that he participated in the 1948 London Olympics. Was there a Chinese football team? And if so, have you got any details of the team and how did they do?\"</strong> wrote Rebecca Yau a while back.</p> <p>Good news, Rebecca, your uncle was not a fibber. The Republic of China did indeed send a football team to the London Olympics in 1948, though sad to relate, their success was limited. They lined up for their first round match against Turkey at midday on August 2, 60 years ago, at the home of football, Green Pond Road, Walthamstow. They finished up on the wrong end of a 4-0 walloping, but were saved from any embarrassment by the USA's 9-0 capitulation to Italy hours later. </p> <p>And <a href=\"http://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/tournament=512/edition=197049/matches/match=32359/report.html\">wearing the No5 shirt</a> in that defeat was Man Chi Chau, Rebecca's late uncle. The team line-ups, goalscorers and all the other results can be found in <a href=\"http://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/tournament=512/edition=197049/results/index.html\">Fifa's excellent archive</a>.</p> <p>It would only be fair to note the football team's achievement in simply lining up at the Olympics. The Chinese government gave next to no funding to its Olympic delegation. In order to secure the finances to fund their Olympic journey, the football team embarked on a 32-match tour of Asia, pocketing their share of gate receipts as they went. The delegation even brought with them their own food, to save on inflated prices in postwar Britain.</p> <p>The Chinese Olympic team that year featured 33 athletes, all of them male, none of whom made it beyond the preliminary stages of their event. The delegation was then forced to borrow money to make it home. It would be fair to say that state funding for Chinese athletes has seen something of an increase in the last 60 years. </p> <p><strong>KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE</strong></p> <p><strong>\"Has a team ever been 'mathematically certain' of winning the title, only to be deducted points and see it go elsewhere?\"</strong> asked Conor Green back in those innocent days of 2005.</p> <p>Actually it has Conor, two seasons on the trot in Yugoslavia back when Croatia, Slovenia and Macedonia were still part of the the federation.

Zeljeznicar were then awarded the game 3-0, handing Crvena Zvezda [Red Star Belgrade] title glory. They even played in the European Cup the following season, before a series of legal decisions restored the original standings with Partizan recognised as champions in 1987. </p> <p>Both Red Star and Partizan began the next season with a six-point deduction because of the previous season's events [along with eight other clubs]. Vardar Skopje, who hadn't suffered any penalty, won the title, themselves taking part in the following season's European Cup.

  "<p>It is hard not to be impressed by the brilliant achievements of the Victorians. The philanthropic men who built proud cities like Liverpool, Manchester, Bradford and Leeds. Armed with a combination of vision and civic pride, they built vibrant, beautiful and thriving communities \u2014 housing, employing and educating the people who lived within them.</p> <p>Yet I wonder how those visionaries would have achieved what they did if bogged down with the bureaucracy, lack of accountability and remoteness of decision-making that now faces the people trying to regenerate those same cities.</p> <p>Over the past 10 years, the government approach of micromanagement, targets, tickboxes and ringfencing has stifled the flair and innovation that built our cities in the first place. Ministers' relentless dragging of power from local, elected representatives to unaccountable and remote quangos has bought about a culture where decision-making is slow, accessing funding is complicated and bureaucratic, and the priorities and concerns of the people actually living there are ignored or overlooked.</p> <p>Why, for example, are there more than 50 different funding streams for regeneration? Why, when more than \u00a310bn is being spent on regeneration, is less than 10% of it channelled through the local councils elected to lead those cities?</p> <p>Take a look, for instance, at the government's much trumpeted Pathfinders scheme. To date, it has spent \u00a329m demolishing more than 12,000 homes, with another 9,000 due to be demolished over the next three years. Irrespective of local views, town halls that fail to meet the arbitrary targets for bulldozing homes face the threat of savage cuts to their funding. The sheer scale of these demolitions \u2014 including Victorian terraces \u2014 is environmentally, socially and financially wasteful.</p> <p>If we are to breathe fresh life into our cities, and provide the kind of living space that families actually want to live in, we need to take drastic action.</p> <p>We have to bring strong local leadership to replace the current, emasculated system by doing away with the remote regional bureaucracy. Instead of regional quangos, local government should be leading the renaissance of our cities. The first step should be to scrap the whole tier of regional planning that \u2014 on top of local and national planning policies \u2014 has created a quagmire of complexity.</p> <p>We wish to see town halls take more control of their own finances, and to work alongside other local authorities to develop their own solutions, not have them imposed by regional bureaucrats or from an air-conditioned office in Whitehall.</p> <p>And there is one more thing we think must happen \u2014 we must bring back the kind of vision and civic pride we saw in those far-sighted Victorians. To create dynamic local leadership and to attract high-calibre individuals, we believe that directly elected executive mayors for top-tier authorities is the best governance model. Almost every major city in the world outside the UK has a directly elected executive mayor, driving forward regeneration and change, so why should our cities not have the same chance? In this way, we hope to free our cities to develop and grow once more into the thriving, exciting centres they once used to be.</p> <p>\u2022 Eric Pickles is shadow secretary of state for communities and local government</p>",
  "<p>Donors will be able to check who runs charities and how they spend donations on a new online register being launched today.</p> <p>Details of charities' aims, activities, trustees and accounts are all included in the new register from watchdog the Charity Commission. </p> <p>For charities with incomes over \u00a3500,000, standardised financial profiles and graphics show what they receive and how they spend their money. There are also details of how many volunteers and employees they have and their track record for submitting accounts. </p> <p>A more succinct financial profile is available for smaller charities. </p> <p>The commission said the move is aimed at increasing the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/voluntarysector\">voluntary sector's</a> transparency and accountability. </p> <p>\"The public quite rightly expects to be able to see how charities are using their money.

  "<p>What makes a city buzz? The most dynamic cities have always been immersed in the critical innovations of their time. Today, the world's great cities compete to lead in innovation in fields such as nanotechnology or genomics, sometimes successfully, sometimes with ineffective copycat strategies. Science and business have been their main focus, along with the arts. Yet many are learning that public sector innovation can be just as critical for growing new sources of revenue. </p> <p>The result is that the best innovation strategies are no longer just about hardware and technology. So Singapore is focusing its energies on creating hi-tech superschools. Adelaide is becoming a hub for higher education. Bangalore has become a centre for healthcare. </p> <p>Jaime Lerner, as mayor of Curitiba in Brazil, pioneered integrated public transport and creative social policies. Antanas Mockus, mayor of Bogota, used mime artists to control the traffic and invested heavily in bicycle routes. Some European cities \u2014 like Freiburg or Hammarby Sjostad in Sweden \u2014 have led the world towards low-carbon living. </p> <p>London's congestion charge, and the many innovations introduced in Manchester by Richard Leese, show that British cities can also innovate. </p> <p>But three barriers usually stand in the way here. One is over-centralisation. Cities simply don't have the powers they need to radically innovate in cutting obesity or the number of disaffected teenagers. A second is culture \u2014 and the fear of taking risks. A third is the lack of institutions, or people, dedicated to public innovation. </p> <p>So what could cities do to become true living laboratories? Do more to finance, support and celebrate innovations, whether they come from the public, frontline staff or anywhere else. Build up the arms-length bodies that \u2014 just as in science \u2014 are better placed to innovate than permanent public bureaucracies (as cities like Toronto have done). And become better at networking with other sectors, since this is often the key to sustained innovation. </p> <p>Britain's cities aren't short of creativity and imagination. But too often their public sector strategies and innovation strategies are entirely separate. It's time for them to come together. </p> <p>\u2022 Geoff Mulgan is director of the Young Foundation </p>",
  "<p>Whatever the woe, blame a failure of leadership. But in the UK, one of the ironies of the focus on \"city leadership\" is that few people really can claim to run cities: leaders tend to have considerably less in the way of autonomy, funding and powers than their US or mainland European counterparts.</p> <p>Yet pick a successful city \u2014 from Barcelona to Boston, Manchester to Munich \u2014 and invariably some form of steady and dynamic leadership helps explain its success. Manchester is an interesting example, where a stable working relationship over many years between politicians and managers \u2014 in this case the local \"Sirs\", Richard Leese and Howard Bernstein \u2014 has served as the background to an impressive reinvigoration of the city. Pick a city that is struggling to find its way and there is likely to be instability, complacency and downright chaos at the top of its institutions.</p> <p>City leadership is a difficult beast to pin down. If it starts with politicians, it also moves out beyond them to the leaders of other important local \"anchor\" institutions and networks. Museums, galleries and cultural institutions, universities, hospitals and businesses are organisations that make profound differences to cities. Leadership within them can be contagious. Once one begins to raise its game, it can encourage others to do so, lifting the mood and momentum of a place. Unfortunately, the tide can turn the other way, too.</p> <p>Our research suggests four skills are paramount: the ability to operate at different levels, grassroots to international; sustained leadership over time \u2014 an enduring approach that overcomes personal fortunes and short-term setbacks; the ability to make honest assessments of a place's strengths and weaknesses; and collaborative leadership \u2014 the ability to involve and partner with a wide range of stakeholders.</p> <p>But how, argues central government, can it risk delegating powers to leaders who seem to lack the capacity to address the challenges and opportunities that cities face? But without giving local leaders the powers, autonomy and funding to really make a difference, it is difficult to attract highly skilled individuals who can make things happen. Risky it may be, but granting more power and funds \u2014 in exchange for greater accountability \u2014 is likely to mean better leadership will follow.</p> <p>Politicians in the UK are starting to think spatially much more when it comes to innovation, skills, worklessness and transport. National problems play out in local places. And local places often have the most innovative contributions to make to national problems.</p> <p>\u2022 Alexandra Jones is associate director of the Work Foundation and lead author of the recent report How can Cities Thrive in the Changing Economy?</p>",
  "<p>City-states, from ancient Greece to medieval Germany, Venice and renaissance Florence, were once powerhouses of trade and commerce. Today, from London to Frankfurt, Munich to Milan, Lyon and beyond, they have been supplanted by city-regions or super-conurbations \u2014 less powerful, obviously, than fully self-governing states, yet increasingly influential on the world stage and a challenge, as well as a counterweight, to national governments. </p> <p>Only in Britain, however, is so much vested in a national government \u2014 be it London or Edinburgh \u2014 with big provincial cities largely diminished in power, lacking both the revenue-raising clout and the influence of mainland European and American cities and conurbations. </p> <p>Stripped of powers in the post-war years by successive governments, sidelined, sometimes ridiculed, monitored and highly regulated by the state, British cities today are a shadow of the great municipal corporations that brought buses, trams, water, gas, electricity, education, health, banking and much else besides to the masses \u2014 recycling money-spinning activities back into town hall coffers. Today, it's hard to believe that these old corporations, from Glasgow to Manchester and Birmingham, civilised Britain long before any government developed a social agenda. </p> <p>Yet in spite of the restrictions under which they are forced to operate \u2014 losing control of public transport, for instance, and raising barely a fifth of their total spending locally \u2014 cities outside London have still staged a remarkable recovery since the mid-90s, with redeveloped centres and new businesses underpinned by stronger universities and greater overall confidence. </p> <p>But compared with Greater London, with its mayoral administration and considerable political influence, British cities languish in a different league. Figures produced by the thinktank IPPR North show that while the south east and London are powering ahead \u2014 although research was undertaken pre-credit crunch \u2014 the three northern regions (north east, north west, and Yorkshire and the Humber) are falling further behind. In terms of productivity and wealth, based on a gross value-added index \u2014 and an average of 100 \u2014 London has jumped from 129 to 136; the north east, by contrast, has slumped from 81 to 79, with the wider north showing similar slumps. </p> <p><strong>Power of London </strong></p> <p>Our capital sits astride Britain like a colossus, determining national policy, from airport to rail investment, and forcing the rest of the country into a secondary role. Part of this is historical; the City of London \u2014 itself an independent local authority and probably the richest municipality in Britain, with huge reserves from extensive land holdings \u2014 remains the world's pre-eminent financial centre, although the fall-out from the credit crunch could diminish that role. </p> <p>But part is the undoubted favourable treatment the capital has received over the past 20-odd years. It has always been seen as a special case. That is why, curiously, it has retained a coordinated public transport system \u2014 surely the economic bedrock of any conurbation \u2014 while, in 1986, a Conservative government deregulated public transport elsewhere in the country and created a market free-for-all, with buses competing against light rail systems such as the Tyne and Wear Metro and Manchester's Metrolink tram system. </p> <p>Belatedly, ministers have had a change of heart. Last year, a Treasury report \u2014 a subnational review of regional structures commissioned when the prime minister was chancellor \u2014 signalled a change of course by calling for the refashioning, if not the dismantling, of England's complex regional apparatus, so triumphantly created by John Prescott in the early years of New Labour. </p> <p>Potentially, the review seemed to have significant implications for local governance. Eight regional development agencies (RDAs), charged with overseeing economic development and regeneration, were to be given a more strategic role by assuming large-scale planning powers from anonymous, non-elected regional assemblies. Although relatively low-profile, the RDAs have grown into substantial organisations, with a combined staff of more than 3,000 overseeing a collective budget of almost \u00a32bn. Assemblies are now facing the axe \u2014 for many, a long overdue acceptance of the inevitable after the crushing 4-1 referendum rejection of plans for an elected north-east assembly in November 2004. </p> <p>But conurbations, or \"city-regions\" in the new jargon, have been promised more powers \u2014 particularly over transport, with road-pricing on the agenda \u2014 and, crucially, a higher profile on the economic front with some functions devolved from RDAs and, possibly, more cash. New regional scrutiny committees, embracing mainly council leaders, to oversee revamped and rationalised structures, have been floated. </p> <p>Now the process is going critical. Key to creating some form of Greater Londonstyle governance in other conurbations is the new concept of a multi-area agreement (MAA), a process of sharing some power across council boundaries in recognition that the economic \u2014 and demographic \u2014 reach of a particular authority extends beyond its political boundaries. That sharing could embrace public transport, skills, employment, training and strategic housing and planning. </p> <p>The first MAA deals, in Greater Manchester and the Tees Valley area, are in the process of being signed off. Greater Manchester, for instance, has proposed an executive body of the 10 council leaders in the conurbation, overseeing a series of commissions covering transport, health, and the economy. </p> <p>But problems are arising. A planned congestion charge for Greater Manchester, hotly opposed by some business interests and local MPs (including former city council leader Graham Stringer) while supported by other business interests, is now likely to be the subject of a referendum later this year \u2014 putting a question mark over its approval. </p> <p><strong><br>Missed opportunity </strong></p> <p>Rejection would represent a huge setback and a missed opportunity. This is because the congestion charge is only part of a \u00a32.7bn transport investment, approved by the government, which includes doubling the size of the Metrolink tram system and creating new bus corridors. </p> <p>Nevertheless, a new local government bill later this year will offer new cityregion structures the chance to underpin conurbation governance with legislation. But any new arrangements will be a world away from the power, and influence, enjoyed by the mayor of London and his city-wide authority which oversees transport, strategic planning, the capital's economy \u2014 through its own development agency \u2014 and the Metropolitan police. </p> <p>However, local government minister John Healey, who led the sub-national review when he was a Treasury minister, remains upbeat. He says he wants to encourage stronger links between councils, such as those in Greater Manchester, where cooperation is most advanced. \"This is precisely the invitation and the proposition that is at the core of the sub-national review,\" he has insisted. \"Specifically, with Manchester or any other group of local authorities that may want to move radically and rapidly on this front, I am ready to encourage them and work with them, [but] the whole principle is not about setting a city-regional blueprint, it's not prescribing...\" </p> <p>Healey maintains that the government is ready to let go, particularly on the transport front \u2014 \"we stand ready to give them additional powers and management control...\" \u2014 as well as in other areas through multi-area agreements covering jobs, skills, economic development, planning and housing. \"The proposition is that if [councils] are prepared to move to a basis that is legislatively established, then in a sense the alibi of the centre \u2014 which is we don't really have sufficient certainty to devolve with confidence \u2014 is removed, or certainly reduced, and you then have a degree of reliability ... that allows you seriously to consider devolving more...\" </p> <p>But it seems a world away from the heady days of 1997 when John Prescott was given a free rein to set up the RDAs \u2014 complemented by regional assemblies \u2014 which he saw as a counterweight to powerful development agencies in the devolved administrations of Scotland and Wales. Conservatives strongly opposed Prescott's regional agenda, and their current position remains ambivalent. While some shadow cabinet members want to scrap RDAs, others \u2014 such as shadow business secretary Alan Duncan \u2014 believe they could still have a role, although the party is against giving the (non-elected) agencies planning powers. Similarly, the Tory line on city-region governance is unclear \u2014 although the party's former deputy leader, Lord Heseltine, who has advised David Cameron, would dearly like city-regions to get elected mayors similar to the London model. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ippr.org/ipprnorth \">IPPR North</a></p>",
  "<p>The north-south divide has a long history in England, culturally and economically. But as recently as 2004, figures have shown the gap between the average economic output of England and its three northern regions had grown to \u00a330bn. This has given great cause for concern and has led to the launch of an initiative called the Northern Way, a partnership between three regional development agencies aimed at boosting the economic development of eight city regions in the north.</p> <p>But while this gap exists, people are recognising another economic dividing line that runs diagonally across the country, from below the Humber in the east to the south-west coast. It forms what Danny Dorling, professor of human geography at the University of Sheffield, calls \"a \u00a3100,000 cliff in house price rises\". With a few exceptions, the gap is effectively between London and the greater southeast, and the rest of the country.</p> <p>Why does this matter? Shouldn't we be content with our strong economy radiating out of the south-east and leave well alone? Yes, it has an impact on equality of economic opportunity, but can't we just leave the market to sort it out?</p> <p>In fact, the overheating of the southeast economy has become a worry \u2014 and it has serious environmental implications too \u2014 but the words \"eggs\" and \"one basket\" also come to mind given the current economic climate.</p> <p>Quite rightly, we hear a lot about the importance of London's economy, but what is less well known is that the combined economies of England's eight regional \"core cities\" and their surrounding conurbations \u2014 city regions \u2014 are actually greater than that of London, contributing 25.5% of national output. Their total population is 16 million, one third of England's total; they account for 18% of the workforce and 25% of those people qualified to degree level or above.</p> <p>This isn't an either-or argument; our cities need London. But it does give a sense of relative scale, and the message is clear: there is another economy out there that can do as much, if not more, for England \u2014 and we ignore it at our cost. At a moment of downturn, the entire UK needs to be firing on all cylinders.</p> <p>The urban policy narrative in England has shifted dramatically over the past 10 to 15 years, from seeing cities as problems (the seat of social terror and economic nightmare) to viewing them as solutions to the economy, society and the environment. Cities are being recognised as the most sustainable places to live, and offering the best chance of dealing with disadvantage. They clearly drive the economy, with some of the core cities accounting for more than 50% of their region's entire output.</p> <p>But some cities in England are struggling to close the productivity gap, creating a further dividing line between places that might be neighbours. Internationally, things look bleaker still. A 2006 report, State of the English Cities, by a group of city experts led by Professor Michael Parkinson, showed that out of the top performing cities in Europe, England had only three in the top 50. France had five, Italy six, while Germany had a staggering 15 in the top 20.</p> <p>Across the great divide then, but the report had two important lessons for thriving cities. First, the most successful European cities enjoy more devolved arrangements than those in England, particularly financially. Here we are heavily centralised and cities directly control only about 5% of the total taxation raised in them \u2014 council tax. Among our competitors, this can be 40-60% and more. They have freedom to decide on local priorities, act quickly to take opportunities and resist economic shocks.</p> <p>Second, they have a tradition of operating across functional economic areas \u2014 city regions. Increasingly, we live and work in a way that takes no account of administrative boundaries; economic and business flows also follow these patterns. The most successful places integrate their strategies for housing, economy, transport and spatial planning at this level.</p> <p>We have seen much progress in recent discussion about empowering cities by devolving finances and control. The forthcoming sub national review of economic development and regeneration is about to conclude, hopefully, in this direction; the empowerment white paper makes proposals for more local democratic engagement; and the Lyons inquiry has made suggestions for empowering local government as \"placeshapers\".</p> <p>As a group, the Core Cities Group \u2014 Birmingham, Bristol, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle, Nottingham and Sheffield \u2014 have been working positively on these issues with the government, RDAs and the Homes and Communities Agency \u2014 an important new player in housing and regeneration. However, change has yet to be felt at local level.</p> <p><strong>Public spending</strong></p> <p>One of the biggest issues cities face is paying for their needs and ambitions at a moment of downturn and decreasing public spending, particularly to finance major infrastructure.</p> <p>With PricewaterhouseCoopers, the Core Cities Group has produced a report that demonstrates how cities might use innovative approaches, allowing borrowing against future income to pay for schemes that generate the proceeds in the first place.</p> <p>Interim findings suggest that such an approach could greatly increase economic outputs, housing units delivered and jobs created in some schemes. It could be used to fund transport projects and climate change measures. At the end of the borrowing period, it would also create a greater return to the Treasury from receipts that would not otherwise exist.</p> <p>But perhaps the starkest and most persistent economic split in England is neither north-south nor east-west. It is between individual cities \u2014 those that have benefited from prosperity and those that have not. The personal difficulties caused by worklessness and a \"cycle of disadvantage\", often concentrated in small areas, cannot be underestimated. It also has an effect on local economies, reducing the workforce, constraining output and productivity and straining public spending. Ultimately, it has an impact on quality of life and quality of place, two factors that, in a knowledge economy with highly mobile businesses, give big competitive advantage.</p> <p>There is some exceptional work taking place but, if we want to reduce economic disparity in England, as well as looking at important regional divides, we need to do more within individual places. In some of our cities, up to 22% of the population have no qualifications. Increasing skill levels can bridge the gap between disadvantage and economic opportunity, but programmes are more likely to succeed working alongside plans for housing, economic development and transport.</p> <p>Which brings us back to devolved control and integration across the real economic geography. It might sound like \"economyspeak\", but allowing cities to play their full economic role will help their citizens and communities have more fulfilling lives.</p> <p>\u2022 Chris Murray is director of the Core Cities Group</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/\">communities.gov.uk/publications/</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.gregclark.net/\">citiesandregions/state4</a></p>",
  "<p>There are multiple reasons why the current economic crisis is so toxic, but one additional, \u00adaggravating factor is that it is unfolding five weeks away from a US election. The disruptive effect of that was clear on Monday, when the US House of Representatives voted down President Bush's bail-out plan \u2014 a function of both his dead-duck status and the fears of 228 Congressman seeking re-election next month. The result is that the stakes in the contest between Barack Obama and John McCain, already stratospheric, have just got higher. The winner will be charged with leading the world through this economic \u00adconvulsion and steering us all to safety. The current polls have Obama in front, but this contest could go either way.</p> <p>Those of us on the outside will \u00adfollow every twist; it is a statement of the \u00adobvious that the entire world will be watching on November 4. But perhaps we shouldn't be. At least if my email inbox is anything to go by, we should have only the scantest interest in the ongoing US election. After all, it's got nothing to do with us.</p> <p>Or, as one emailer put it: \"We are electing the President of the United States and the world can choke on it.\" His was one of a deluge of mainly hostile responses to a column that appeared here three weeks ago, arguing that the world's verdict would be harsh if Americans chose McCain over Obama. In their thousands, Americans wrote to tell me they read my words not as a simple prediction of the consequences of an American decision broadly to maintain the Bush-Cheney approach \u2014 but as some kind of threat. I was not merely commenting on the US election, they said, but intervening in it, seeking to blackmail American voters with the threat of global ostracism (as if I'm in a position to issue such a threat). </p> <p>The counterblasts featured all the usual themes familiar to any columnist or blogger who wades into this terrain. America had saved Europe's \"ass\" twice before \u2014 and we would doubtless come bleating for help again when we inevitably sought rescue from the Muslim hordes imposing sharia law on London, Paris and Berlin. We can't defend ourselves, of course, because we are limp-wristed \"Euroweenies\", effeminate socialists whose own decline robs us of the right to say anything about the United States, which remains the greatest nation on earth. </p> <p>Britain specifically forfeited the right to meddle in US affairs more than two centuries ago, when it lost the War of Independence. Besides, Obama is a Marxist, so Europe is welcome to him. One Bill07407 managed to capture the flavour of this virtual avalanche \u2014 including the curiously homoerotic undercurrent that runs through much rightwing American invective \u2014 with this effort: \"If you want Comrade Obama we will gladly ship him over after he loses in a landslide. Meanwhile you can kiss my ass. I bet you would enjoy it faggot.\" Equally reflective, this from bioguy777: \"I love it! A pansy-ass limey Brit begs the US to do his bidding while his own country slips further towards total Islamic rule. We're electing McCain, and the rest of the world can piss up a rope if they don't like it. 1776, BITCH!\"</p> <p>In among the abuse were three \u00adarguments that need addressing. The first is that this election has nothing to do with those of us outside America (so \"butt out\"). The trouble is, it has plenty to do with us. That has been true of every contest since 1945, when the US emerged as the sole superpower in the democratic world. But it has been undeniable since 2001. </p> <p>Take Britain. Our soldiers have fought in two wars, Afghanistan and Iraq, that were wholly conceived and planned in Washington. Sure, it was Tony Blair's choice to take part in the invasion of Iraq, but that meant following a decision that had been made by an American president. No one doubts that had George W Bush decided the other way, Britain would not have gone to war in 2003. </p> <p>If not blood, then treasure. The financial crisis now devouring British banks bears a three-word stamp: \"Made in America.\" It was the US fad for sub-prime loans, handing out money to would-be homeowners who were not creditworthy, that triggered the credit crunch and, with it, the current turmoil. Yesterday President Bush acknowledged that its impact would be felt outside US borders when he sought to \"assure our citizens and citizens around the world\". Never was the hoary cliche truer: they sneeze and we catch a cold. </p> <p>If war and economic meltdown aren't sufficiently persuasive, then how about a planetary emergency? The US is a first-rank contributor to the problem of climate change, responsible for a quarter of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, despite having just 5% of the world's population. But, as \u00adThomas Friedman argues in his new book, Hot, Flat, and Crowded, the US is also indispensable to any solution. Only a radical transformation of America's approach to energy \u2014 generating it more cleanly and using less of it \u2014 could establish the kind of model and foster the technological innovation that would set a lead followed around the world. </p> <p>So, Americans who say that since they don't poke their nose into our domestic affairs we should stay out of theirs, are making a bogus comparison. The battle of Brown v Cameron won't affect them. But the battle of Obama v McCain will affect me and every other Briton, \u00adEuropean and citizen of the world. It could determine whether we are at peace or war, whether our \u00adeconomy thrives or enters a depression. This is not a mayoral election in rural Bulgaria, a purely internal matter of interest only to the locals. It damn well is our business.</p> <p>What's more, Americans would not have it any other way. They like to define their president as the \"leader of the free world\". So why is it such a cheek if the free world shows some interest in who that leader will be? Americans, you can't have it both ways: either you're the global superpower, in which case the world has a stake in your future direction, or you're not. But you can't act like \u00adAmerica and expect to be treated like Liechtenstein: it doesn't work that way. </p> <p>The second charge to be defeated is that to talk like this is somehow anti-American. The \u00adreverse is true. For what is prompting non-Americans to follow the \u00adcurrent election so closely is not just an acknowledgement that the US is the dominant force in international life, but a yearning for America to lead once more. I saw that clearly in the crowd of 200,000 that greeted Obama in Berlin in July. They wanted to feel about an American president the way their parents had felt about John F Kennedy, to be awed once more, as Bill Clinton puts it, by the power of America's example, not the example of its power. And, for most non-Americans, that means an end to unilateral wars and a moral lead on climate change \u2014 not a continuation of the past eight Republican years. </p> <p>Lastly, those Americans who say they don't give a \"rat's ass\" what the rest of the world thinks are letting themselves and their country down. America was never meant to be a closed, introverted nation, turning its back on the world. It has always aimed to inspire the rest of us, to be a shining city on the hill. In these autumn weeks, the world is \u00adlooking to the city once more, hoping desperately that the light is not about to fade. </p> <p>freedland@theguardian.com</p>",

  "<p>The pivotal deal brokered by the government for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/lloydstsbgroup\">Lloyds TSB</a> to rescue beleaguered mortgage bank <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/hbosbusiness\">HBOS</a> was in jeopardy last night after a plunge in the value of HBOS' shares. </p> <p>City investors fear that Lloyds is paying too much for the Scottish-based bank because its shares have collapsed since the deal was announced two weeks ago. </p> <p>Yesterday HBOS, owner of the country's biggest mortgage lender Halifax, was again the biggest faller in the FTSE 100 index of leading shares, dropping 13%. </p> <p>HBOS is now worth just \u00a36.4bn but Lloyds TSB has agreed to pay \u00a39.8bn. The differential in the price has heightened fears that the deal may not go through on the original terms which were agreed after the Prime Minister intervened to ensure the takeover could proceed.</p> <p>Last night Gordon Brown was forced to throw his weight behind the transaction which is crucial to the survival of HBOS. Brown said: \"This merger between HBOS and Lloyds TSB is a matter of great detail and I am confident from talking to people involved that this merger is going ahead.</p> <p>\"We have already dealt with this by helping the merger between these two banks. We have changed the competition law. The shareholders will eventually have to make a decision in a few days time about what is right for them, but I am confident from the leading parties that not only they want this to go ahead, but they are determined to do all the work to make this possible,\" Brown said.</p> <p>Despite the intervention by the prime minister, Lloyds TSB shareholders are concerned that the bank is taking on too much risk in buying HBOS, which is dogged by concerns about its ability to find enough funds on the paralysed money markets to keep operating. There are fears that Lloyds will be weakened by the takeover.</p> <p>Robert Talbut, chief investment officer of Royal London Asset Management, said: \"There is a growing feeling that Lloyds could have struck a better deal and that there is pressure for the terms to be reassessed\".</p> <p>The deal is in shares rather than cash. </p> <p>The offer price fluctuates each day with the Lloyds TSB share price. The takeover - which will allow a combination of Lloyds TSB and HBOS to dominate the high street in breach of all the competition rules - is controversial for big City investors. </p> <p>Most of them own shares in HBOS and Lloyds. But those who own more Lloyds shares feel Lloyds is over-paying, while those who own more HBOS stock fear that HBOS has caved in for too low a price despite the precipitous collapse in its share price.</p> <p>A major investor confirmed last night that the deal was \"not secure\".</p> <p>\"The market is suggesting that the deal is not going to happen. And the market is usually right,\" the investor said.</p> <p>The City is mesmerised by the difference between the HBOS share price and the value of the Lloyds TSB offer. Last night it stood at a discount of 35% with HBOS shares at 122.4p which is below the 188p value placed on the shares by the Lloyds TSB offer. In normal circumstances, the HBOS share price might be expected to trade closer to the offer price.</p> <p>Under the terms of the transaction, each HBOS share is worth 0.833 of Lloyds shares. But City sources now believe the terms should be scaled back to 0.6 Lloyds shares.</p> <p>Donald Tosh of private client stockbroker Spiers &amp; Jeffrey said: </p> <p>\"The message from the discount is that there is a problem with the deal. Around the world every bust bank has been bailed out by the respective governments. But in the UK, Lloyds is bailing out HBOS and that's why the huge discount has emerged.\"</p> <p>Last night Lloyds insisted the deal was on track. Chief executive Eric Daniels said: \"Market conditions are obviously difficult. But the acquisition of HBOS remains a fantastic opportunity to create the UK's leading financial services and to create great value for both sets of shareholders\".</p> <p>A spokesman added: \"We are working diligently towards completing the transaction and a huge amount of work is going on behind the scenes\"</p> <p>While City sources believe it is implausible that the takeover will fall apart given the role the government has played in brokering the marriage by allowing the competition rule book to be rewritten, they are acknowledging the share price movements indicate that the market has concerns.</p> <p>The support of shareholders in both banks is crucial. Under the structure of the transaction, Lloyds needs 50% support from its shareholders to complete the deal, while HBOS requires 75% of its shareholders to support the deal. </p> <p>The government told Lloyds it would ensure the deal was cleared by the competition authorities, while Lloyds promised to ensure it would keep the mortgage market afloat, particularly by offering loans to first-time buyers. </p> <p>HBOS has a 20% share of the mortgage market - more than any another other lender - and has 1,100 branches and 70,000 staff. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338146013\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2008/09/30/HBOS_0110.gif\" alt=\"HBOS_0110.gif\" width=\"473\" height=\"889\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Combined with Lloyds, the new group's branch network will jump to 3,000 and its mortgage market share will jump to 28%.

  "<p>As well as a new breed of musicians, the British pop and rock music upheaval of the 1960s produced a clutch of young music business moguls who created their own rules as they went along. One such was Bryan Morrison, who has died aged 66 after two years in a coma following a polo accident. Morrison was closely associated with the careers of Pink Floyd, the Bee Gees and, later, the Jam and George Michael. He was equally successful in applying his showbusiness nous to polo, which he helped to revolutionise as a club owner and player.</p> <p>The 1980s new romantic musician and club owner Richard Strange once described Morrison as \"visually conforming to the most crudely drawn caricature of a cigar-chomping East End Jewish wide-boy\" while in fact being \"a self-educated man of astonishing flair and instinct, charismatic and confident to the point of arrogance\". Morrison's cockney accent belied his lower-middle-class background as the son of an accountant from Hackney, east London. </p> <p>At school he excelled at art and design and he went to study at the Central School of Art at the beginning of the 60s. He was a contemporary of Dick Taylor, a guitarist who had rehearsed with future members of the Rolling Stones before forming his own R&amp;B band, the Pretty Things. During 1963 the group built up its reputation on the London club and student union circuit, and Morrison was prevailed upon to assist the Pretty Things' move into a full-time musical career.</p> <p>Morrison's skills as a salesman brought the group more engagements and a recording contract. He soon took on other clients and over the next five years the Bryan Morrison Agency became one of the leading London booking agents for R&amp;B and progressive rock, as well as organising tours for US acts. He also became the exclusive booker for such \"in\" London clubs as Blaises, the Cromwellian and the Revolution, in Bruton Street, Mayfair, above which he had his office. Among the groups who passed through its doors were Fairport Convention and the Incredible String Band and, at one stage, the future polo associate of the Prince of Wales was the agent of choice for the underground bands of Notting Hill such as Tyrannosaurus Rex, the Deviants and the Pink Fairies.</p> <p>Pink Floyd was the most important band represented by the agency in the mid-1960s and Morrison helped to start their recording career when he invited Norman Smith of EMI Records to attend a performance at the UFO Club. Soon afterwards, he made his first fortune by selling the agency to Nems, the company originally formed by the Beatles manager Brian Epstein. Morrison and his staff joined Nems and one of his associates, Steve O'Rourke, went on to become Pink Floyd's manager.</p> <p>For some time after the founder member Syd Barrett left the group, Morrison helped to look after his business interests. As Barrett's behaviour became more erratic with the onset of mental illness, Morrison managed his royalties and arranged some of his final music press interviews that took place at Bruton Street. In later years, as the cult around Barrett grew, Morrison, often brusquely, tried to protect his privacy. His continuing regard for Syd was evident in his choice of Crazy Diamond (from the Pink Floyd song about Barrett) as the title of his own memoirs, which remain unpublished.</p> <p>During the 1970s, Morrison focused on his music publishing interests. As well as songs by Barrett, he published compositions by Paul Weller of the Jam, and by the Bee Gees, one of which was the B-side of the multi-million-selling single Night Fever. However, his biggest coup came in the early 1980s, when, with a new partner, Dick Leahy, he signed a publishing contract with two suburban lads recording as Wham! Morrison Leahy Music went on to publish all the Wham! hits and many of George Michael's solo songs.</p> <p>By this time Morrison had discovered the second great passion of his career. He once described the first time he attended a polo match as \"eight guys tearing down the field like maniacs whacking the ball about. My heart leapt and I was hooked.\" He became an accomplished player, one of the few amateurs to attain a handicap of three. He joined the Guards Polo Club but was appalled at its facilities, \"horrible 1950s drab with a single, crummy, ice-cold shower.\" When his suggestions for improvement were instantly rejected, he bought a former racing stables in Berkshire and designed his own club. The Royal County of Berkshire Polo Club opened in 1985 and has been credited with making polo a fashionable pursuit. Its members have included Prince Charles and his sons, and the Duchess of York's father, Major Ronald Ferguson, was the club sponsorship manager. The polo club has been valued at \u00a312m and, in 2004, the Sunday Times rich list calculated Morrison's personal wealth to be \u00a360m.</p> <p>He was less involved in the music business in his later years, although his Morrison Music purchased a majority stake in Snapper Music, the British licensee of the Sun rock'n'roll catalogue, in 2005. The following year a polo accident left him in a coma with severe brain injuries. He did not regain consciousness. </p> <p>Morrison is survived by his wife Greta, a former model, his son Jamie, a polo player, and his daughter Karina, a film-maker.</p> <p>\u2022 Bryan Morrison, music publisher and polo club owner, born August 14 1942; died September 27 2008</p>",
  "<p>David Cameron says he \"passionately\" believes in the need to \"localise power\", and the Tory party has this week certainly been parading its credentials as the friend of local government. But passion sounds a bit OTT. </p> <p>How municipal services are paid for and delivered should interest many more of us than it does. Some advanced souls may even have views about the scale of police forces, the regionalisation of the fire service, and the accountability of housing associations. But there you start to get into anorakdom. </p> <p>Cameron is going to keep his suit on. Were he to come to power at Westminster, he would throw some meat to his followers in the town and county halls - a policy initiative here, a loosened corset there. After all, the Tories are the dominant party in English local government. But the Tory leader will not \"embark on a mass dismantling of the powers of the central state ... initiating a massive transfer of powers to councils\".</p> <p>That quote is from a report on the review by the ex-local government minister David Curry for the Tory strategy being drafted by policy chief Oliver Letwin. But Cameron won't enter a general election with heavy commitments to councils round his neck. Breaking up Labour's regional edifice will benefit them, yes. But watch shadow chancellor George Osborne's take on proposals to increase council participation in health and police. Like Margaret Thatcher, Osborne doesn't believe local decisions are necessarily cost saving. As for giving councils financial autonomy, it won't happen.</p> <p>In practice, the Tories are going to be a lot less enthusiastically localist than they sounded this week. That's partly because the Daily Mail and its version of Middle England, scourge of the primary care trusts, will veto more local variation in healthcare. Tory plans for salving the wounds of \"broken Britain\" prescribe national remedies, not local opt-in. </p> <p>Conventional wisdom says we are all localists now. Everyone wants communities in control - the title of communities secretary Hazel Blears's white paper in July, although successive fringe meetings at Labour's conference last week heard other ministers openly dissenting from her evangelical faith. It's true that councils have had a better press in recent years, and their assessed performance has improved. The Local Government Association has upped tempo, and it's more difficult for Whitehall departments to miss the local dimension of policy. </p> <p>But all that is a recipe for cautious adjustments within a known framework of central-local responsibilities, not a democratic revolution. With their heroic invocations of civic activism, localists can appear blind to sociological reality. Where are the social, let alone economic, forces to back a seismic shift in decision making downwards?</p> <p>Councils turn out to be as mistrusted as other bits of government. Local taxation is hated more deeply than other kinds of taxation. The political problem faced by the thinktanks - and Guardian columnists - who so strongly advocate a great boost to council powers is that people are indifferent, if not actively hostile. A black hole separates what they tell pollsters about their appetite for participation and what they do in their daily lives, where they can barely bother to identify the ward they live in, let alone who represents them or the division of responsibility between different local public bodies. </p> <p>Arecent report on public understanding of risk (<a href=\"http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/purrr\">lse.ac.uk/collections/purrr</a>) showed that people blame councils almost as vehemently as they do the EU for \"interference\", and more than they blame national government. </p> <p>The localists' moment may now have passed. When, as now, government is the only solution to the ailments of markets, the array of powers mustered by town halls don't quite fit the bill. Dismantling the central state when the gales of recession are howling and financial storms are blowing people's houses down isn't sensible politics because it isn't sensible.</p> <p>\u2022 David Walker is shortly to become managing director of communications and public reporting at the Audit Commission.</p>",
  "<p>Zeus once let fly two eagles from the ends of the world: one from the east and one from the west. They soared high over oceans, mountains, forests and plains, until they met at the very centre of the earth, its omphalos, or navel. On this spot, a temple to Apollo was dedicated, the home of the Delphic oracle, where those who wished for insight into their past, present or future might come to consult the god. The questioner would be led into the temple's dark heart. In the gloom, the visitor would more sense than see the Pythia - the laurel-crowned woman who acted as the sacred conduit for the god's communications. In a trance, amid the heady fumes of burning laurel and barley, she would begin her utterances: divinely inspired fragments that the priests would interpret and fashion. But as the inquirer passed under the temple colonnade, before he stepped into the inner sanctum itself, he would have seen some letters carved into the portico: gnothi seauton - \"know thyself \".</p> <p>This extraordinary challenge to achieve self-knowledge still rings out commandingly. It captures one of the things that is most exciting about ancient Greece: from the writings of its greatest thinkers and authors what stands out is an almost visceral need to question, to probe, to debate, to turn accepted opinion on its head - whether the subject of inquiry is the state of the human heart or the nature of justice.</p> <p>The intellectual achievements of the ancient Greeks were quite simply extraordinary. They shaped the basic disciplines and genres in which we still organise thought: from poetry to drama, from philosophy to history, from natural history, medicine and ethnography to political science. We have been inexorably moulded by ancient Greece: the way we think about right and wrong, about the nature of beauty, goodness and knowledge; the way we conceive of what it is to be a mortal being amid the immensity of the universe; the way we talk about the past, and our ambiguous relationship with war; the way we discuss politics and citizenship. The tracks that lead back from our world to the Greeks' are narrow, meandering, sometimes virtually rubbed out or invisible - but they are there. What the Greeks did and said still casts light on what we say and do; by looking at the Greeks we can understand more about ourselves. The Greeks, in short, can help us answer their own challenge of \"know thyself \".</p> <p>The world of \"ancient Greece\" was certainly not confined geographically to the Greek mainland, nor was it a single entity. There were Greek settlements dotted all around the Mediterranean, from Marseilles in the west, to the coast of Asia Minor in the east. In fact, many of the most glamorous intellectuals of ancient Greece came from the coastline of what is now western Turkey. Nor is \"Greece\" (in Greek Hellas) a term that would necessarily have been widely understood. The Greek world was made up of hundreds of politically independent, often disputatious city-states, each with separate systems of government, locally distinct religious cults, even different calendars and names for the months of the year. </p> <p>When we think of \"ancient Greece\", we tend to be drawn to just one of these hundreds of city-states, and at one particular time: Athens in the fifth century BC. This is perfectly understandable, as during its flowering of power between the routing of the Persians in 479 BC and its own crushing by Sparta in 404 BC, it was a magnet for writers, artists and thinkers from all over the Greek world, and the scene of the most exciting intellectual revolution that the world has ever witnessed. The Athenians have always made the most noise; and they left us an abundance of literary masterpieces, not least the great dramas of Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides, written for performance at the Athenian festival called the City Dionysia. Still, it is best to remember that the Athenians weren't the only Greeks, nor were they even \"representative\" Greeks. </p> <p>So, it is worth thinking about ancient Greece because it brings us a perspective on the way we live now, from our politics to our sense of history. And reading the Greeks is also a source of unbounded enrichment and pleasure. But even more important than all this, perhaps, is the idea of \"ancient Greece\" not simply as a specific place or a time, but a realm where the imagination, the emotions and the intellect can roam free. We will never completely grasp ancient Greece. An enormous wealth of literature, art, architecture and other artefacts have survived but, for every survival, there are a thousand losses. We have 20 dramas by Euripides, but we know that his complete works numbered 90 plays. For Aeschylus, we have seven out of 90 extant. And for Sophocles, just seven out of 123. Works that were seen as masterpieces in antiquity are nothing but dust, ashes and the occasional quote in other texts.</p> <p>For me, the writing of Plato acts as a wonderful metaphor for our relationship with ancient Greece. Plato did not write in the form of treatises; he did not propound theories, even. His philosophy is almost always written as dialogues between two or more speakers: its very form encapsulates disagreement, debate and provisional answers rather than unshakeable dogma. Incompleteness, as it were, is at its heart. In the same way, knowledge of ancient Greece is fugitive, fragile, difficult to grasp. When the mind travels to ancient Greece, it embarks on a quest - an idea CP Cavafy, the great modern Greek poet, put beautifully in his poem Ithaca, which takes the idea of Odysseus' homecoming: </p> <p>When you set out for distant Ithaca, <br>fervently wish your journey may be long, - <br>full of adventures and with much to learn.</p> <p>And, as we set out on that long but rewarding journey towards Ithaca, we will come closer to answering that ancient challenge: gnothi seauton</p> <h2>Do you speak more Greek than you think? </h2> <p><strong>Spartan</strong><br>As in, \"Tarquin, I know the minimalist look is right up your street, but don't you think the room looks a little spartan with the actual floorboards removed?\"</p> <p>Simple, severe, lacking in comfort: that does in fact pretty much sum up what we know about the life of the Spartans. Despite its position as a Greek military superpower, the place had none of the kind of impressive architecture that would have overwhelmed the eye of a fifth-century visitor to Athens. Famously, Sparta also lacked walls or fortifications (it demonstrated that the inhabitants were such butch soldiers they didn't need nancy-boy walls to keep them safe). But being \"Spartan\" also meant adhering to a system of iron discipline, with boys taken out of their families for military training at the age of seven and, uniquely for ancient Greece, girls also given an education and athletic training - the better, presumably, to give birth to warrior sons. This was the background that produced the toughies who, vastly outnumbered, held off the Persians at Thermopylae, until all 300 were slaughtered. Dedication, bravery and suicidal bloodymindedness are thus also Spartan virtues.</p> <p><strong>Laconic</strong><br>As in, \"Darling, I know being a teenage boy is all about communicating in grunts, but if you could descend from your laconic monosyllables occasionally, I'd be terribly grateful.\"</p> <p>Laconia was the region of the Peloponnese that Sparta controlled; \"laconic\" refers to another Spartan quality: a severe, economic, and sometimes dryly witty way with words. </p> <p><strong>Aegis</strong><br>As in, \"Don't worry, Henry, the animal care comes under the aegis of the National Donkey Protection League, which I am sure has impeccable standards.\"</p> <p>Frankly, the aegis - a symbol of divine power - has always struck me as one of the weirdest things about the Greek gods. I can do no better than quote the Oxford Classical Dictionary, which describes it as an \"all-round bib with scales, fringed with snakes' heads and normally decorated with the gorgoneion\". (Gorgoneion being classicist-speak for the head of the Gorgon Medusa.) The aegis, the entry helpfully adds, may sometimes be tasselled. I have also heard it described as looking like a sporran.</p> <p><strong>Thespian</strong><br>As in, \"Brenda has marvellous talents as a thespian, you know. You should see her Lady Bracknell.\"</p> <p>Thespis was the man who, according to Aristotle, \"invented\" Greek drama, adding a prologue and speech to what had previously been a choral performance. </p> <p><strong>Herculean</strong><br>As in, \"Cleaning the bathroom and kitchen floors, Muriel, seems to me to be a labour of Herculean proportions.\"</p> <p>Hercules is the Romanised name of Heracles, the greatest of all heroes, and one of the few mortals to attain the status of a god. The labours, set him by Eurystheus, king of Argos, were 12 in number. Heracles had something of a problem with madness and mass murder: the labours were done to expiate the killing of his wife Megara and their children, which he committed in a bout of insanity visited on him by the goddess Hera. Another story has him killing the father and brothers of his girlfriend Iole. To purify himself, he worked for the queen of Lydia, Omphale, for three years. The twist was that he had to do this as a woman - spinning and weaving, in drag, a scene vividly depicted on a Roman well-head in the Townley Collection of Roman antiquities in the basement of the British Museum.</p> <p><strong>Tantalising</strong><br>As in, \"I've just caught a tantalising glimpse of Frank's homemade apricot ice cream and I can't wait to taste it.\"</p> <p>From Tantalus, one of the very first generations of mortals. Invited by the gods to dine on Mount Olympus, he decided to kill, cook and serve up his son Pelops to see whether his hosts would detect the forbidden food (as you do). Demeter, distracted by her grief for her daughter Persephone, was the only immortal who tucked in, polishing off a shoulder. The gods reconstructed Pelops and brought him back to life, with a prosthetic shoulder made from ivory. Tantalus's eternal punishment in the Underworld was to stand in a pool that drained away when he tried to drink from it and beneath branches groaning with fruit that drew away when he reached for them. A tantalus is also a lockable stand for a set of decanters. You can see the booze, but you can't get at it without the key ...</p> <p><strong>Colossal</strong><br>As in, \"I'm heading for a colossal overdraft. Drinks on you, I'm afraid.\"</p> <p>From the Colossus of Rhodes, one of the seven ancient wonders of the world. In 305 BC, Rhodes was attacked by the Macedonian Demetrius Poliorcetes and successfully saw off a year-long siege. Demetrius abandoned his siege equipment on the island, and the grateful Rhodians used the proceeds from the sale of all that to erect a 33m statue to their patron, Helios, the sun god. However, it stood for only 56 years; an earthquake in about 226 BC undermined the statue at the knee. Even in ruins it still excited visitors, such as the Roman writer Pliny, who noted that its thumb was too big for most men to be able to clasp in their arms, and that its very fingers were bigger than most ordinary statues. The Statue of Liberty is inspired by the Colossus of Rhodes.</p> <p><strong>Draconian</strong><br>As in, \"Miss, don't you think punishing smoking with a public flogging is a bit draconian?\"</p> <p>Draco, by tradition, set down the first Athenian law code in 621 or 620 BC, the first time the city's laws had been put in writing and displayed in public. Evidence is thin as to what these laws comprised: but according to tradition, it was the death penalty for pretty much everything. One Athenian in the fourth century quipped that Draco wrote his laws in blood rather than ink. \"Draconian\" is always a negative word in English, but you could argue that setting forth a state's laws in public for the first time was, in its way, a reforming measure ... though Draco's code was itself reformed soon enough, in 594/3 BC by Solon, who repealed everything except the law on homicide.</p> <p>The boy's name Draco, for understandable reasons, has failed to take off: though it was famously pulled into service by JK Rowling for one of her most memorable baddies, the sinister Draco Malfoy. This is not surprising, given that JK studied classics and French at Exeter University and is rumoured to have based Dumbledore on the splendidly bearded Peter Wiseman, Exeter's classics professor emeritus.</p> <p><strong>Ostracise</strong><br>As in, \"I should think you'll be completely ostracised from the golf club, Derek, if you go anywhere near it in those trousers.\"</p> <p>Ostracism was a method by which, through the Athenian democratic reforms introduced by Cleisthenes in 508 or 507 BC, a citizen could be exiled for 10 years after a majority vote in the assembly. The name of the chosen man was written on a shard of pottery, an ostrakon. Nearly 200 ostraka have been found in an Athenian well, with the name Themistocles written on them in a very few hands. Presumably he was at the receiving end of a carefully orchestrated campaign.</p> <p><strong>Odeon</strong><br>As in \"What's on at the Odeon? I quite fancy catching 300 again there. Nothing I like better than a pumped-up Spartan wearing leather knickers.\"</p> <p>The notable cinema chain is named, ultimately, for one of the great buildings on the slopes of the Acropolis, the odeion, or music hall (and in fact, there were odeia in other Greek cities, too). The Athenian odeion was a square hall with pillars supposedly made from the masts of Persian ships taken at the battle of Salamis in the Persian wars. Men and boys' choral competitions, part of the festival called the City Dionysia, were held there, as well as previews of the main tragic plays. Popcorn was not served.</p> <p><strong>Hoi polloi</strong><br>As in, \"Ivy says she can't bear to go shopping on a Saturday. The town centre is just too full of hoi polloi, apparently.\"</p> <p>Hoi polloi is Greek for \"the many\", meaning the ordinary people. Used with more than a soup\u00e7on of snobbery in English. To say \"the hoi polloi\", incidentally, is strictly speaking a gaffe, since it means \"the the many\" as hoi is the definite article.</p> <p><strong>Platonic</strong><br>As in, \"Susie's relationship with David is purely platonic, you realise.\"</p> <p>The sort of admiring, passionate but asexual regard for young men that Socrates engaged in. Alcibiades slept one night under a cloak with Socrates, according to Plato - but, he said, it was just like sleeping with a brother or a father. Socrates just wasn't interested in going all the way. You could see this as a metaphor for his pursuit of knowledge: it's about the quest, not the consummation.</p> <p><strong>Cynical</strong><br>As in, \"I'm fed up with you lot being cynical grouches. Let's bring in a bit of joy, people!\"</p> <p>A philosophical school, or, more accurately, way of life, practised from the fourth century BC. Diogenes, who supposedly lived in a barrel, was the most famous Cynic - the word probably derives from the Greek for dog, so cynicism means \"doggishness\". It seems that adherents tried to live in accordance with nature, seeing animals as exemplars of anxiety-free living, and eschewing ambition, power, material possessions, even education. Diogenes once famously masturbated in the street. Our word \"cynical\" thus takes a bit of leap from its ancient origins.</p> <p><strong>Stoical</strong><br>As in, \"Martha has been tremendously stoical since her house burned down and she lost her job.\"</p> <p>Stoicism, founded in the fourth century BC by Zeno of Citium, was an extremely significant philosophical school. Empiricism and materialism were key features; in the realm of ethics, freeing oneself from emotion and living in accordance with human nature (which for Stoics was indivisible from human reason), was of great importance. Virtue, argued Stoics, was sufficient for happiness.</p> <p><strong>Sceptical</strong><br>As in, \"The government claims it's going to have London ready for the 2012 Olympics, but frankly, I'm sceptical.\"</p> <p>\"Sceptic\" was a label introduced in the first century BC to describe the position of philosophers who held no doctrine and suspended judgment on, well, everything.

  "<p>Gurkha veterans who were refused the right to settle in the United Kingdom because they retired from the regiment before 1997 were treated unlawfully and the policy used to reject them was misleading, a high court judge said yesterday.</p> <p>In a ruling highly critical of the Ministry of Defence, Mr Justice Blake said its advice to the Home Office on whether to grant settlement to the Gurkhas was confusing, resulting in \"irrational and unlawful\" restrictions being applied.</p> <p>He ruled that the decision to refuse visas to five Gurkha veterans should be quashed and that the Home Office pay 80% of their costs. The five former soldiers and a regimental widow sought a judicial review of the refusal to grant them entry on the grounds that they had \"no strong ties\" to the UK.</p> <p>The policy that led to the refusals needed \"urgent revisiting\" said the judge, setting a deadline of three months. The Home Office, he added, should \"take political responsibility for the outcome where it is answerable to the electorate\". </p> <p>Yesterday's ruling was a striking victory for the Gurkhas and it could open the door to more than 2,000 veterans who have had their visas rejected under the policy.</p> <p>As the judge retired to his chambers, more than 100 Gurkhas packed into the public gallery shouted \"Ayo Gurkhali\", the Gurkha rallying cry meaning \"Forward Gurkhas\". Outside the courtroom, as a bagpiper played, hundreds more chanted and clapped and some cried. </p> <p>The actor Joanna Lumley, whose father served with the Brigade of Gurkhas for 30 years, said the judgment had given the government the \"chance to right great wrongs and wipe out a national stain\" and vowed the campaign would continue until the policy was rewritten.</p> <p>In his ruling, Blake cited the military covenant - which provides UK armed forces and their families with proper care, in return for asking them to risk making \"the ultimate sacrifice for their country\". He said: \"Rewarding long and distinguished service by the grant of residence in this country for whom the service was performed would be a vindication and an enhancement of this covenant.\"</p> <p>The law failed to take into account years served, whether injuries were inflicted and whether medals of valour - including the Victoria Cross - were won.</p> <p>The government argued that since the Gurkhas' regimental headquarters were in Hong Kong until 1997, the soldiers did not develop close enough ties to the UK.</p> <p>Another \"inconsistency\" was the failure of Gurkha veterans of the Falklands war to obtain visas. The judge contrasted this with the government's treatment of Falkland islanders. It seemed \"curious\" for the Home Office to conclude that the islanders had sufficient connections with the UK to be allowed residence \"but those who risked their lives and limb to bring them their freedom did not\".</p> <p>Last year, a government review allowed Gurkhas to apply to settle under a policy known as the Armed Forces Concession, which gives a soldier serving with the British army the right to settle in Britain after four years of service anywhere in the world. For Gurkhas alone, the policy drew a line in the sand at July 1, 1997.</p> <p>The Gurkhas were not, however, discriminated against on grounds of race, a claim that the judge ruled to be \"wholly unfounded\".</p> <p>Martin Howe, the human rights lawyer representing the Gurkhas, called the ruling \"a tremendous and historic victory\".</p> <p>\"It is a victory for common sense; a victory for fairness; and a victory for the British sense of what is 'right',\" he said. \"My clients, and the thousands of Gurkhas standing behind them, ask for nothing more from this country than the unfettered right to live amongst the British people - a people they have protected and loved throughout years of long and loyal service to the crown.\"</p> <p>In a statement, the home secretary, Jacqui Smith said: \"In light of the court's ruling we will revise and publish new guidance. We will honour our commitment to the Gurkhas by reviewing all cases by the end of the year.\"</p>",
  "<p>John Higgins, the twice world champion, reached the last 16 of the Shanghai Masters with a 5-4 win over Tom Ford, the world No48 from Leicester. </p> <p>Higgins and Steve Davis, who yesterday eliminated the defending champion, Dominic Dale, 5-4, are behind a new players' union which their respective managers, Pat Mooney and Barry Hearn, are launching with the assistance of George Davies, a Manchester law firm with extensive sporting experience. </p> <p>\"It's time players had a proper voice,\" said Higgins. \"We've looked very closely at the workings of other sports. Football, tennis, golf and darts all have their own players' association and one for snooker is long overdue.\"</p>",
  "<p>One of the adjectives frequently bandied about when it comes to chef and author Sophie Wright is \"young\". \"It was my 22nd birthday at the weekend,\" she says. \"I don't feel young at all! I left school just after my GCSEs and went straight to college for three years, so I've been in the industry five or six years. I guess I'm the new girl on the scene compared to the likes of Anthony Worrall Thompson who have been doing it for ever.\"</p> <p>Perhaps the emphasis on Wright's youth is more because she has achieved an incredible amount for her age. While training in London she regularly took part in national and international culinary competitions, winning 15 medals, including eight golds. She went on to become one of the youngest head chefs in the country when at the age of 20 she took control of the kitchen at Beach Blanket Babylon in London.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338151429\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2008/10/01/soph1.jpg\" alt=\"Sophie Wright, author of cookbook Easy Peasy\" width=\"140\" height=\"200\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sophie Wright, author of cookbook Easy Peasy</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>With her easygoing style, it was only a matter of time before she was called away from the kitchen to join the roster of television chefs, frequently popping up on Market Kitchen, Daily Cooks and BBC2's Food Poker. \"Every time I was on telly it was with two guys who had their own restaurants and had been in the industry for years and they looked at me like 'What have you done?' But, considering my age, I thought I'd done quite a lot,\" says Wright. \"If you speak to a lot of chefs, there's a feeling that you've sold out if you do media work but I think you can do both. I'm sure I'll go back into a kitchen at some stage - preferably my own.\"</p> <p>The precis of Wright's first book, Easy Peasy: Laid-Back Cooking for Lazy Days, is accessibility, avoiding culinary jargon and obscure ingredients. It includes sections on \"posh lunchboxes\", brunch menus and possibly the easiest jam recipe ever. \"I would never say you need to go to a specific market and buy a particular cheese,\" she says. \"I like doing things like that myself but it's just not viable sometimes if you've got a family and you're trying to feed six people a night. The aim of the book is to be approachable, nothing too scary.\"</p> <h2>Noodly oriental broth </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338151430\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2008/10/01/sb1.jpg\" alt=\"Noodle broth from Sophie Wright's cookbook Easy Peasy\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Noodle broth from Sophie Wright's cookbook Easy Peasy</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is really quick to cook, but also full of flavour and healthy.

Place the stock in a pan and bring to the boil. Add the ginger, garlic, half the chilli, lemongrass, soy sauce and fish sauce. Allow to infuse for a couple of minutes.</p> <p>Add the chicken breasts and slowly poach to keep them moist inside. They should take 8-10 minutes, depending on size. Halfway through cooking, add the noodles. With one minute to go, add the pak choy, followed by the mushrooms and the beansprouts. Don't over-cook the mushrooms or they will go slimy and spongy.</p> <p>To serve, remove the chicken from the stock and cut into slices to make it easier to eat. Place in big bowls, pour the broth on top, and sprinkle with the reserved chilli. Garnish each bowl with a sprig of coriander.</p> <h2>Retro risotto with beetroot and goat's cheese</h2> <p>This is probably the most outrageously coloured plate of food you will ever cook.</p> <p><strong>Serves four</strong></p> <p><strong>2 large beetroots</strong></p> <p><strong>50g butter</strong></p> <p><strong>2 shallots, finely chopped</strong></p> <p><strong>1 leek, white part only, finely chopped</strong></p> <p><strong>1 garlic clove, chopped</strong></p> <p><strong>Sprig of thyme, leaves only</strong></p> <p><strong>350g arborio rice</strong></p> <p><strong>150ml white wine</strong></p> <p><strong>1 litre hot vegetable stock, ideally homemade but from a cube is OK</strong></p> <p><strong>150g goat's cheese, crumbled</strong></p> <p><strong>75g parmesan, finely grated</strong></p> <p>Peel and dice the beetroot as small as you can. Melt the butter in a shallow-sided pan and add the shallot, leek, garlic and diced beetroot. Cook slowly and allow the vegetables to go translucent. Once this has happened, add the thyme and rice. Turn the rice over in the now purple ingredients and ensure that every grain is coated in the butter.</p> <p>Turn up the heat slightly and add the white wine. Keep the rice moving at all times. When the liquid has all been absorbed, add a ladleful of hot stock. Continue to add a ladleful at a time, stirring to keep the rice constantly on the move. This takes about 15 minutes.</p> <p>When the rice is just underdone, add the goat's cheese and the parmesan. Correct the seasoning with salt, if necessary, and serve. </p> <h2>Rhubarb and ginger jam</h2> <p>You need jars with tight-fitting lids.

Rub the base of your preserving pan or your biggest, heaviest saucepan with a knob of butter.</p> <p>Wash the rhubarb. Drain and dry well and place in your buttered pan. Add the ginger and the lemon zest. Sprinkle on the sugar. This is best left overnight covered, out of the fridge, to allow the sugar to slowly dissolve.</p> <p>The next day, place the pan on a very low heat and allow the fruit to start to bleed into the sugar. Don't stir the pan - it won't burn provided the heat is low enough. Shake the pan when the juices have started to run a little and the sugar has dissolved. This should take about 10-12 minutes. Now add the lemon juice, which will create steam. Turn up the heat and allow the jam to come to the boil. Boil for about 10 minutes. Turn down the heat. Remove a small spoonful and place on one of your cold plates. Allow to cool and if it sets with a little skin, the jam is ready. If it doesn't, re-boil the jam and do the test again. Keep testing until it forms a skin on top.</p> <p>Now stir in the second knob of butter and allow to cool slightly before pouring it into your sterilised jars, placing a jam paper on top, sealing tightly with the lid, and labelling.</p> <h2>Granola bars</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338151431\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2008/10/01/sf7.jpg\" alt=\"Flapjacks from Sophie Wright's cookbook Easy Peasy\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Flapjacks from Sophie Wright's cookbook Easy Peasy</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Treat this recipe as a guide - you can use whatever fruit and nuts you like as long as the quantities are roughly the same.</p> <p><strong>Makes 16 bars</strong></p> <p><strong>Butter, for greasing</strong></p> <p><strong>50g unsalted butter</strong></p> <p><strong>200g runny honey</strong></p> <p><strong>225g rolled oats</strong></p> <p><strong>50g sunflower seeds</strong></p> <p><strong>50g whole almonds</strong></p> <p><strong>40g whole hazelnuts</strong></p> <p><strong>200g dried fruit of your choice (figs, dates, raisins, apricots, cherries, blueberries, cranberries)</strong></p> <p><strong>50g pumpkin seeds</strong></p> <p>Preheat the oven to 180\u00b0C/350\u00b0F/Gas Mark 4.

  "<p>The government's plans to extend to 42 days the time limit for detention without charge will receive a further blow today from the Council of Europe. A report for the council will raise \"serious doubts\" about the compatibility of the proposals with European human rights legislation.</p> <p>The critical report comes in the wake of last week's claim by the former head of MI5 Dame Stella Rimington that 42 days was an excessive time for a suspect to be held without charge. </p> <p>The plan to increase the detention time limit from 28 to 42 days faces rejection when it goes to the House of Lords after the summer recess.</p> <p>The council's parliamentary assembly's committee on legal affairs and human rights concluded that it had \"serious doubts as to the compatibility of certain elements of draft counter-terrorism legislation in the United Kingdom with the requirements of the European convention on human rights and the Strasbourg court's case law.\" </p> <p>The committee found that detention of terrorist suspects for up to 42 days without charge, with limited judicial review, \"can lead to arbitrariness\", which would be in breach of articles on the right to liberty and security and a fair trial.</p> <p>It added that \"the proposed legislation is unduly complicated and is not readily understandable\". </p> <p>The report, which is due to be debated tomorrow, also contained tacit criticism of the government's tactics in its conclusion that \"terrorism must be fought with means that fully respect human rights and the rule of law, excluding all forms of arbitrariness. Injustice breads terrorism and undermines the legitimacy of the fight against it.\"</p> <p>A separate - but equally damning - report by the council's committee for the prevention of torture (CPT), adds fuel to the criticisms, with an attack on the conditions in which terrorist suspects are being detained at Paddington Green police station in London, in what has been described as a \"very austere environment\". </p> <p>The report warns that conditions at the 1960s station, which a parliamentary committee has previously described as \"plainly inadequate\", are placing detainees at risk of ill-treatment, and singles out minimal access to natural light and less than 20 minutes' exercise in a cordoned-off section of the car park as matters of concern. </p> <p>Although a spokesman for the Metropolitan police accepted that \"improvements are needed\" in response to the criticisms at Paddington Green, the government has broadly rejected the council's recommendations. </p> <p>The Home Office also defended its increased use of video links for court hearings, which the CPT also criticised in its report as inadequate to fulfil the requirement of suspects having their detention authorised by a judge. </p> <p>Hugh Chetwynd, a spokesman for the CPT, said: \"In our experience the first few days of detention is the time when detainees are at their most vulnerable. It is essential that a judge can make a proper assessment of their wellbeing, as is the case for all other criminal defendants except those detained under the Terrorism Act.\" </p> <p>The Home Office insisted that the use of video links, which will continue under the new counter-terrorism bill, was a \"cost-effective and expeditious\" alternative to bringing detainees before a judge in person.</p> <p>The government's rejection of the council's findings has further provoked critics of the new legislation. \"Britain once used the Council of Europe to promote fundamental freedoms in younger democracies,\" said Shami Chakrabarti, director of Liberty. </p> <p>\"It is embarrassing in the extreme that this same council should have to tell a UK government why it's wrong to imprison people for six weeks without charge.\"</p>",
  "<p>There was a moment in the first episode of the new Jamie Oliver TV series last night when the Essex-lad-made-millionaire had an outburst worthy of a revolutionary. Emerging from a mealtime visit to Natasha, a single mother on benefits in Rotherham, he raged in his own inimitable language of protest: \"Fucking hell ... it's fucking Great Britain. It's 2008. I've been to Soweto and I've seen Aids orphans eating better than that.\"</p> <p>Natasha feeds her two children takeaways most nights. Aged five and two, they have never eaten a meal that has been properly cooked at home. Instead, they sit on the floor - no table, no cutlery - and eat shavings of doner kebabs or chips with processed cheese from polystyrene boxes with their fingers. Even instant noodles have to be negotiated without forks. The bottom drawers of Natasha's fridge are stuffed full of sweets and chocolate bars. \"This is where all my money goes,\" she admitted. About \u00a370 out of a weekly benefits cheque of just \u00a380 on fast food and junk. Five-year-old Kiya has already had to go to the dentist twice to have rotten teeth removed. Natasha can see the life of obesity and illness ahead of them; it's not that she doesn't share the middle-class fantasy of sitting down to a cosy communal table each night, but despite her eight-hob gas cooker and the countless cookery shows on her flatscreen TV, she doesn't seem to know what to do. </p> <p>Whenever Oliver leaves her, in this and subsequent episodes of his TV mission to teach the nation to cook, he is stirred to the same outrage, shouted from the barricade of his celebrity jeep. Natasha turns out not only to have a big cooker and TV but debts large enough to make her a pawn-shop regular, and depression deep enough to make her give up trying. When Oliver finds this out he confides to the camera in his car, \"I don't blame her ... but I'm fucking angry. I'm fucking angry and I don't know who with or what with.\" He has just met poverty in all its 21st-century complexity - and it has a profound effect. </p> <p>Miss this Ministry of Food series and you'll be missing some of the most powerful political documentary in years. In it, whether by intention or accident, the naked chef has entered the domestic life of a British town and captured a snapshot of the country's social health. The result is an indictment of the current political system as disturbing as any ideological tract. Food, and real people's experience of it, is still all about class. </p> <p>The subtext is everything. Geoff, the 84-year-old Rotherham man who has never cooked in his life, seems keen and quick enough. Why he should suddenly be facing a crisis is never fully explained. But it turns out that his wife and lifelong helpmeet now has Alzheimer's disease and so everything is falling to him. He asked Citizens Advice where he could learn to cook. They had no answer. Does he have children to help? Yes, several, it turns out, but presumably distance and some of the longest working hours in Europe make it hard for them to give the support he needs. Clare, who is overweight and lives on 10 packs of crisps and a large bar of Galaxy chocolate a day, seems to struggle to read when given a recipe by Oliver. Is she one of those who fell through the net at school so that not only does she not know that liquids bubble when they boil but she stumbles when literacy and numeracy are required? This is a delicate but painful portrait of the socially excluded.</p> <p>Middle-class people in the series eat junk, too. Time, or lack of it, is their problem. Women getting home from work can't find even half an hour to cook from scratch for the family, which Oliver can't understand. There are cultural barriers to eating well too. But what makes Oliver and the viewer angry, what shocks, is the deprivation. </p> <p>Food has always been about class in Britain. \"The nature of our diets has been entirely shaped by the class system of the 19th century and the white working-class experience of industrialisation,\" says Tim Lang, professor of food policy at City University in London. \"From the first- when cheap white bread was sold to the poor as progress, because previously only the rich could afford it - what class you are from, and how much you have to spend has made a dramatic difference to what you eat, how you eat it and what you aspire to eat. Class imbues everything in food.\" </p> <p>Which socio-economic class you are born into is still one of the most significant determinants of how healthy you will be. Natasha is simply conforming to the pattern. Her mother was a single parent on benefits too - she didn't pass on cooking skills to Natasha, and Natasha has none to give to her own children. The cycle of deprivation looks set to continue. Sharp inequalities can be clearly mapped, even short distances apart, according to Dr Tim Lobstein, director of the childhood research programme at the International Association for the Study of Obesity. Travel the eight stops on the Jubilee line tube from Central London's Westminster to Canning Town and you find a decrease in life expectancy of nearly one year for each station going east. </p> <p>A child born in one deprived Glasgow suburb can expect a life 28 years shorter than another living only 13km away in a more affluent area, a three-year investigation for the World Health Organisation found in August. Commenting on one of the key factors, the report concluded: \"Obesity is caused not by moral failure of individuals but by the excess availability of high-fat, high-sugar foods.\" The marketplace can generate wealth but it can \"also generate negative conditions for health\", which will only be resolved by tackling \"the inequitable distribution of power, money and resources\", it went on. In Rotherham, where areas around the town centre have deprivation levels that put them in the worst 6% of the country, one in 10 reception-age schoolchildren are obese. By year 6, 18% of them are obese, while 60% of adults are either overweight or obese. </p> <p>Right across the country, those on low-incomes suffer higher incidence of a whole range of illnesses relating to poor diet. Lobstein catalogues them: higher rates of anaemia caused by lack of iron, especially in pregnancy. Mothers from low-income groups are also more likely to have children of low birthweight, who, in turn, are likely to suffer poor health and educational prospects as a result. Working-class families have more dental disease and more childhood eczema and asthma. They are more likely to suffer from obesity, both as children and as adults. They have higher rates of raised blood pressure, thanks to excess salt in their processed diets. They are more likely to suffer diabetes, heart disease, vascular disease and strokes. They suffer more cancers of the lung, stomach and oesophagus. They have more cataracts caused by poor nutrition than those in other classes. And the protective role of good diet is missing. A survey of men and women living on benefits found that a third ate no fruit at all during the week their diets were recorded. </p> <p>It's not just diet, of course - alcohol and tobacco consumption are implicated, too, as poverty ties a Gordian knot of health problems. Over half of younger children in low-income groups are inactive almost all day as well, with two- to 10-year-olds getting less than 30 minutes of physical activity daily. </p> <p>Elizabeth Dowler, professor of food and social policy at Warwick University who was recently involved in the government's Low Income Diet and Nutrition survey, says the class differences are stark but complicated. \"If you live for more than six months on the minimum wage or on benefits there is growing evidence you cannot afford to buy the food you need for health. It is still to do with class but it's complex to unpick. Food is the flexible area that you cut back on when you are on a low income. Unlike council tax or utility bills, no one fines you if you don't spend on food and no one takes your children away, so that's what you cut, and you have a fag because that takes the hunger away.\" </p> <p>When you are on a low income you buy the kind of food that fills you up most cheaply. What may seem ignorant choices to others are in fact quite rational. Lobstein has calculated the cost of 100 calories of food energy from different types of food. The cheapest way to get your 100 calories is to buy fats, processed starches and sugars. A hundred calories of broccoli costs 51p, but 100 calories of frozen chips only cost 2p. Good-quality sausages that are high in meat but low in fat cost 22p per 100 calories, but \"value\" fatty ones are only 4p per 100 calories. Poor quality-fish fingers are 12p per 100 calories compared with 29p for ones made with fish fillet that are higher in nutrients. Fresh orange juice costs 38p per 100 calories, while the same dose of energy from sugary orange squash costs 5p. </p> <p>The FSA pointed out when it published its survey on the effect of low income on diet that middle-class people were eating increasingly high levels of junk, too. However, the same survey found that nearly a quarter of poor households skipped meals because they didn't have enough money. Nearly 40% worried that they would run out of food before more money came in. And yes, the working class smoke more and drink, as Oliver, falling over beer cans and fag ends outside a Rotherham house, notes. </p> <p>It has been unfashionable recently to talk in class terms, but there's nothing here that hasn't been raised for decades, centuries even, as both Lang and Lobstein point out. When George Orwell wrote The Road to Wigan Pier in the middle of the 1930s depression, he set out to record the lives of the English working class in the industrial north. He was appalled by the quality of their diets. \"A man dies and is buried and all his actions forgotten but the food he has eaten lives after him in the sound or rotten bones of his children.\" Orwell wrote down detailed accounts of how unemployed working-class people on welfare spent their money. He doubted it was even theoretically possible to live on their allowance. \"The basis of their diet is white bread and margarine, corned beef, sugared tea and potatoes. Would it not be better if they spent more money of wholesome things like oranges and wholemeal bread?\" Yes it would he answered, but \"no ordinary human being is ever going to do such a thing. The ordinary human being would sooner starve than live on brown bread and raw carrots ... A millionaire may enjoy breakfasting off orange juice and Ryvita, an unemployed man doesn't ... When you are underfed, harassed, bored and miserable, you don't want to eat dull, wholesome food. You want something a little bit tasty. Let's have three pennorth of chips! Put the kettle on and we'll all have a nice cup of tea!\" </p> <p>To sit down to table to eat a family meal at leisure was always a luxury, according to food historian and consultant to the National Trust Sara Paston Williams. \"In the slums of industrial towns in the 19th century everyone including the children was out working, and if you were poor you didn't have an oven to cook, so you didn't get together for a family meal.\" The royal family were in part responsible for the creation of the myth of the ordinary family meal, with father Prince Albert, mother Queen Victoria and children sitting down together, although aristocratic children were, in fact, largely fed in the nursery. Mrs Beeton spread the idealised habit to the burgeoning middle classes, who were keen to copy the rich and differentiate themselves in their new wealth from the poor. The pre-industrial and rural experience of food was different. Food might be short in bad years but generally you had better access to a wider variety of foods, including some milk and vegetables in the country. Families working on the land broke off together to eat in the fields. But the Victorian urban poor lived on takeaways, hot pies from the pie man often full of horrible stuff, and adulterated white bread and adulterated marrow jam. </p> <p>To be hungry was deemed a natural state, and a necessary one since it goaded people who might otherwise be idle into working. James Vernon has traced changing attitudes to food and lack of it in Hunger: A Modern History. \"Two hundred years ago hunger was considered a spur to effort. Adam Smith and Thomas Malthus debated whether the emerging market economy would eradicate hunger or depended on it, but both agreed that the market should be left to produce plenty or want without intervention from the state. </p> <p>\"It was only in the second half of the 19th century that this view was first challenged, when hunger was discovered as a humanitarian issue, that reflected the failure of the state to protect its citizens from economic downtowns over which they had no control.\" </p> <p>The seminal work that changed attitudes was Friedrich Engels' The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1845. Drawing frequently on contemporary reports he read in the Manchester Guardian, he catalogued the misery of the poor quality, adulterated and inadequate diets of the poor. \"The habitual food of the individual working man varies according to his wages ... descending gradually ... until on the lowest round of the ladder potatoes form the sole food. As an accompaniment weak tea with perhaps a little sugar, milk or spirits is universally drunk ... such a way of living unavoidably engenders a multitude of diseases.\" </p> <p>Yet today the language of class has been almost removed from the political discourse. In Thatcherite and Blairite Britain, it has been framed instead in terms of \"choice\". There is talk of the need to give people opportunities, but after that, it's down to individual responsibility. It is no accident that the government's white paper on health and obesity was called \"Choosing health\" rather than the \"social determinants of health\". </p> <p>Roger Stone, Labour leader of Rotherham metropolitan borough council, is reluctant to put food and poverty in its class context, too. \"Jamie's programmes are not about us, it's not about the middle class, he's targeting people who are struggling,\" he told me. You mean the working class then? \"No, goodness, in this day and age, it's not class.\"</p> <p>You sense that Oliver used to think the same. Give people a chance, then it's up to them, and if, like some of the catering students in his previous programmes, they don't choose to take it, he's got no time for them. </p> <p>But here he's on a journey. The series is set in Rotherham because it was there that a group of mothers helped their children rebel against the new school menus imposed during Oliver's last series. Julie Critchlow took orders for chips and crisps and shoved them through the school railings at lunchtime, earning herself a place in tabloid mythology. \"Fat old scrubber\" was what Oliver called Critchlow back then. He may speak estuary but he is firmly positioned with the middle classes who almost exclusively buy his books and watch his cooking shows. But Critchlow has her revenge. As phlegmatic as a tricoteuse at the guillotine, she tells him firmly in this series that he \"lives in a bubble\", he has no idea what it's like for ordinary people on benefits. And she and her elderly mother, who did teach her to cook, want to get a pair of choppers on his head. Oliver symbolically submits: he puts his designer hair mess into the hands of Critchlow's hairdresser daughter. A little while later he is found complaining to his producer: \"Fuck. What's happened to my barnet?\" </p> <p>But it has done the trick, because now he talks differently. He's learned that you can't parachute in with change and waltz out again; tackling class inequality is a long, hard slog. This time he wants to get the whole town on board, to shift the tribe. He's not interested in training those who won't pass it on, who only want to cook for themselves as individuals. \"This is about the home, it's about family, it's about neighbours.\" With impeccable timing, as the global markets go into meltdown, Oliver discovers social capital and declares: \"They've got to own it. It's about ownership\".</p> <p>\u2022 Join the debate on food and class <a href=\"http://theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth\">theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth</a></p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/zimbabwe\">Zimbabwe</a> government's power-sharing agreement appeared near to collapse yesterday after President Robert Mugabe demanded the right to appoint all key cabinet ministers, threatening to render the opposition powerless.</p> <p>After an hour-long meeting between the 84-year-old president and the prime minister-elect, Morgan Tsvangirai, the latter's opposition party Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) said it had asked the South African mediator Thabo Mbeki to salvage the process.</p> <p>However, South African officials last night could not confirm they had received a request. Mbeki resigned as president on September 21.</p> <p>The MDC spokesman, Nelson Chamisa, said: \"We want to share power. But Mugabe wants to swallow the MDC. We will not allow that. He wants all the key ministries - finance, home affairs, defence, information, foreign affairs, justice and even women and youth.\"</p> <p>On Monday, after returning from the UN general assembly in New York, Mugabe told a crowd at Harare airport that he would appoint a cabinet \"before the end of this week\", suggesting he would not await for the agreement of the MDC.</p> <p>Zimbabwe has been without a government since parliament was dissolved in January ahead of elections on March 29, in which the MDC won a lower-house majority and Tsvangirai forced Mugabe to a presidential run-off poll. The violence preceding the second election on June 30 prompted Tsvangirai to withdraw.</p> <p>Under a power-sharing agreement mediated by Mbeki and signed on September 15, the government was to have 31 ministries. In a bid to reflect the parliamentary election result, 13 of the ministries were to be nominated by Tsvangirai's MDC and a further three by another faction of the MDC, led by Arthur Mutambara.</p> <p>But talks about which ministries would be offered to whom had not been completed before the signing and the process began to falter amid an unrelated power struggle in South Africa, in which Mbeki was ousted as president a week later.</p> <p>In New York last week, President Mugabe claimed agreement had been reached on all but four ministries, which he did not name but which were believed to be home affairs, finance, local government and foreign affairs.</p> <p>The international community was looking to the MDC to win control of at least the finance ministry and preferably foreign affairs before resuming full trade relations and ultimately lifting travel bans and asset restrictions on leading figures in the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic Front (Zanu-PF).</p> <p>Observers had suggested that Mugabe wanted control of the defence ministry, and therefore the army, but might be prepared to relinquish home affairs, and thus control of the police, to the opposition.</p> <p>But it now appears that negotiations had never reached such an advanced stage. Nor did they progress while Mugabe was in the US for 10 days.</p> <p>John Makumbe, a political analyst at the University of Zimbabwe, said the agreement was \"full of holes\" from the start.</p> <p>He said: \"I do not know what the MDC were thinking when they signed it. The agreement left Mugabe with all the powers. It was defective because it never allocated the levers of power.</p> <p>\"Now he has behaved in his predictable fashion. He is not only backing out of the deal but it is clear that he was simply trying to use the MDC as a glove to bring back foreign direct investment.</p> <p>\"By the end of this week we can expect to have a cabinet just as Mugabe wants it. He is under pressure from [Zanu-Pf's] old guard who do not want to lose their jobs.\"</p> <p>Makumbe shared misgivings expressed by observers about Mbeki's role. Despite endorsement by the Southern African Development Community and the African Union, he is seen as lacking clout as mediator now that he is no longer president.</p>",
  "<p>Your article (How turning into banks led to ruins, September 29) points out an important truth - mutual financial institutions have weathered the credit crunch storm far better than demutualised societies, which threw away their legacies for short-term monetary gain. These demutualised societies are now largely gone. As citizens and consumers we were sold the idea that mutual societies were quaint and something from the past - the future needed financial institutions that could operate globally and have access to international capital. How muddle-headed this all seems now. </p> <p>Today we need a new mutualism that brings financial and social benefits to members rather than remote turbo-capitalist institutions. Reclaiming mutuality as a viable concept is part of rebuilding a progressive consensus and trust in the financial system. In social housing, for example, this new mutualism is being built by the Commission on Co-operative and Mutual Housing, established by a range of socially concerned agencies, which seeks to forge a more mutual housing future and will be recommending how housing cooperatives might contribute to a more balanced national housing strategy that places coherent and active communities at the heart of policy.<br><strong>Kevin Gulliver</strong><br>Research and development director, Human City Institute </p> <p>Now that nationalisation is back in vogue (Northern Rock, Bradford &amp; Bingley), how about a few more obvious targets, like the railways and utilities? Can anyone seriously argue that consumers of gas and electricity are better off than when these basic resources were in public ownership? Some people made short-term gains on the shares, but we're all paying the price now. These companies employ armies of people to badger us into switching suppliers - a ridiculous waste of time and money. Bills have gone up faster than pre-privatisation, but the service is far worse. Railway privatisation set back the cause of environmental transport by at least 10 years, and while our European neighbours invest heavily in high-speed rail, we're stuck with a slow and overpriced system.</p> <p>New Labour is now distancing itself from the dodgy banking practices it once so admired. But I'd like to see a wholesale repudiation of the failed Anglo-Saxon economic model which has held sway since the 1980s, enthusiastically supported by this government. Alastair Darling tells us this is a global phenomenon, but it isn't. France and Germany, with their social market economies, are not experiencing a credit crunch, and - thanks to strict regulation - their gas and electricity consumers are sheltered from the colossal price rises hitting us in the UK.<br><strong>Michael Rundell</strong><br>Canterbury, Kent </p> <p>In a press release on September 25, the Bradford &amp; Bingley chief executive was quoted as saying: \"We are a strongly capitalised bank ... and have a business which is fit for purpose going forward.\"</p> <p>He omitted to mention that his timescale for going forward was two days.

  "<p>My father, Albert \"Rox\" Roxburgh, who has died aged 94, was one of the leading electrical engineers of his generation. Working for GEC, he designed heavy duty switchgear for major projects around the world, including, in 1959, the Kariba dam, which straddles the Zambezi river between Zambia and Zimbabwe. His business trips took him to the US by boat, and later to Africa, New Zealand and Australia in the first passenger jets. During the 1950s and 60s he was granted several patents for high-voltage circuit breakers. He kindly passed on the proceeds to me: $1 per patent, which I received as 7s 6d (35p). </p> <p>Rox was born in the London borough of Southwark, the eldest of three brothers; his father was one of the navvies who dug Leicester Square underground station, his mother was a Harrods shop assistant. He left school at 14 for an apprenticeship in the drawing office of the engineering company BTH in Willesden, north London. He continued to study, at the Borough Polytechnic and elsewhere, for many years. </p> <p>During the second world war, being in a reserved occupation, he served in the Home Guard, memorably refusing a high-ranking officer entry to Wembley Town station until he produced an ID card. He also played rugby for London Wasps.</p> <p>He remained with BTH after it was taken over by AEI in 1960 and later merged into GEC, progressing to the post of chief designer and then works manager at Willesden. He became a fellow of the Institution of Electrical Engineers in 1963, and eventually a technical director of GEC Switchgear in Manchester. He applied his design skills at home too; among his inventions were complex draught excluders which rose as the door was opened.</p> <p>Persuaded to take ballroom dancing lessons by my mother, Dorothy, who thought it a useful social skill, Rox passed the gold medal exams of the Institute of Ballroom Dancing. He applied similar dedication to golf and bridge, sticking to his retirement plan to \"play golf every day\" well into his 80s. He was a modest man, kind and generous, with time as well as money. Widowed in 2004, he is survived by myself, his son-in-law, three grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.</p>",
  "<p>Unlike most concertos, where soloist is pitched against orchestra in a dramatic jousting match, Beethoven's fourth concerto is marked by a more collaborative effort. It is tuned toward a delicate exploration of the expressive energy that accumulates through the piano's opening chords; phrasing, consequently, is everything. And if Mitsuko Uchida's intelligent and minutely attentive style made for a predictably exemplary solo performance, the London Symphony Orchestra were her equal in every respect, matching her for precision of timing and rounded purity of tone.</p> <p>Watching Uchida can be almost as great a delight as hearing her. Beethoven's magnificently extended trills seem to travel up her fingers from the keyboard, extending gradually along her arm before taking hold of her entire body, shimmering in loose silks. An avuncular Sir Colin Davis twinkled back, conducting for the most part with his playfully communicative eyes.</p> <p>A somewhat rude awakening followed with William Walton's Belshazzar's Feast. The orchestra doubled in size; Davis appeared to follow suit as he adopted the command and precision of gesture necessary to control the massed ranks of the London Symphony Chorus. Peter Coleman-Wright's solo baritone was convincing, even if he could not quite match the electricity of the chorus. And the extended brass and percussion sections thrillingly, if somewhat violently, purged the ear of all traces of Beethoven's intensely poetic utterance.</p>",
  "<p>Britain's financial watchdog will unveil plans next week to raise protection for savers in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/banks\">banks and building societies</a> to \u00a350,000 as the government sought to reassure the public that it would do \"whatever is necessary\" to tackle the impact of the global <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/creditcrunch\">credit crisis</a>.</p> <p>Amid signs yesterday of cross-party cooperation to prevent further runs on UK institutions, the Financial Services Authority is to begin urgent consultations with the City about raising the limit from the current \u00a335,000. The FSA will argue that \"at a time of market uncertainty it is important that deposits are properly protected. Raising the limit to \u00a350,000 would be designed to further reassure customers\".</p> <p>Ministers said yesterday that Treasury guarantees to depositors in Northern Rock and Bradford &amp; Bingley meant the government had already toughened up protection to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/savings\">savers</a> beyond the \u00a335,000 limit.</p> <p>Government sources said last night that the normal three-month consultation might be shortened in view of the unfolding financial crisis, particularly as the chancellor, Alistair Darling, had been urging the FSA to begin the process since June.</p> <p>Policymakers were yesterday given some breathing space from the crisis when dealers in the City held their nerve following the near-800 point drop in Wall Street's Dow Jones industrial average on Monday.</p> <p>The FTSE closed 1.7% higher - up 83.7 points at 4902.4 - while the Dow recouped more than half of Monday's fall in morning trading, amid hopes that Congress will agree to the White House's $700bn bail-out plan at the second time of asking later this week. Oil prices were up $4 a barrel and the US dollar also recovered following Monday's wipeout of shares. President Bush warned that the consequences would be \"painful and lasting\" if the deal was not passed.</p> <p>With the unwillingness of banks to lend to each other still causing immense stress in the global money markets, Gordon Brown gave full support to Bush. The prime minister held a breakfast meeting with the chancellor and the governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn King, to discuss the crisis, and senior members of opposition parties were also involved in talks with ministers yesterday.</p> <p>Brown responded coolly to a call from Nick Clegg, the Liberal Democrat leader, for a cast-iron guarantee that no depositor would lose out. The current \u00a335,000 ceiling covers 96% of deposits and an increase to \u00a350,000 would leave only 2% of accounts outside the scheme.</p> <p>The Irish government yesterday guaranteed all deposits at six of the country's key lending institutions, but Brown is wary of matching the move, fearing the government simply does not have the cash to back up such a pledge.</p> <p>The Irish step, widely seen to be in breach of EU competition law, has also angered the Conservatives, even though they kept their criticism private in an attempt to form a new bipartisan consensus to help stabilise the markets .</p> <p>In practice there appears no way to unstitch the Irish initiative even though it may attract depositors to take their savings to Dublin, denuding British banks of badly needed and mobile capital.</p> <p>Asked if he would follow the Irish example, Brown said in a round of interviews: \"Wherever there has been a problem we have taken action. Let us remember, the Irish are dealing with taxpayers' money. We have got to do what is right and also what is reasonable. Of course, we look at every intervention it is possible to take; but people can see from the actions we have taken so far that depositors have been protected, and no depositor has lost money.\"</p> <p>David Cameron yesterday ended his attacks on the Labour stewardship of the economy to offer the kind of bipartisan support which failed to emerge in the US, leading to the disastrous Congress vote against the $700bn US treasury bail-out. \"We cannot allow what happened in America to happen here,\" he said.</p> <p>Brown, enjoying a revival in the polls, stressed the decisive and quick action he had taken and added that he would rely on the initiative and resourcefulness of the British people to see the country through the crisis.</p> <p>Darling said: \"I already have taken the powers I need, and I have made it clear, through Northern Rock and this weekend with Bradford &amp; Bingley, that I will do whatever is necessary.\"</p> <p>Anthony Grech, a market strategist at IG Index, said it may not take much for market sentiment to turn negative again: \"Expectations are that this bail-out will get rubber-stamped sooner rather than later - but recent events have done nothing for market sentiment, so at the moment it would be somewhat over-optimistic to expect that this rescue plan will be the answer to all of the current problems.\"</p> <p>In the City, the gap between the official bank rate and three-month sterling interbank rate - the level at which banks lend money to each other - continued to widen, adding to upward pressure on borrowing costs for mortgage payers and businesses.</p> <p>The White House, the treasury secretary Henry Paulson, congressional leaders and presidential candidates John McCain and Barack Obama maintained pressure on Congress to pass the bail-out bill by the end of the week. Last night the Senate agreed to vote on the bail-out bill later today ahead of the House of Representatives revoting on the issue.</p> <p>\"There's an overarching belief that at some point this week, whether it's Wednesday or Thursday, we'll get something passed by the House,\" said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies &amp; Co in Boston. Without the bail-out plan, which would allow the US treasury to buy toxic mortgage-related assets from banks, credit markets could remain frozen and lead to a recession.</p> <p>\"I assure our citizens and citizens around the world that this is not the end of the legislative process,\" Bush said.</p>",

The Advertising Standards Authority said in its adjudication: \"We considered that readers of the ad were likely to infer that her motive for doing so was seduction.\" <br><strong>Press Association</strong></p> <h2>Antiquities seized in UK to be returned to Kabul</h2> <p>More than 1,500 looted artefacts seized by customs at Heathrow are to be returned to Afghanistan.

  "<p><strong>Human Rights</strong></p> <p>Cherie Booth was heckled yesterday when she defended the Human Rights Act at a fringe meeting. </p> <p>She was given a generally polite reception by the audience. But they expressed their disapproval loudly after she clashed with Chris Grayling, the shadow work and pensions secretary, over the HRA. They were on the panel at a fringe meeting organised by the Sun on \"fixing broken Britain\". </p> <p>\"We need to tear it up and start again,\" Grayling said. Blair said he was being \"specious\". As she tried to say that the HRA was there to protect fundamental rights such as the right to life, some activists heckled her but she went on to defend the act. \"We should be proud that in our country we do not have an elected dictatorship, and that the courts are there to protect individual rights. And, yes, that does apply to the most unpopular people, whether they are criminals, whether they are Gypsies, whether they are illegal asylum seekers, because in the end we are a decent society and we believe that everybody is entitled to respect and that has to be policed on our behalf.\" </p> <p><strong>Development</strong></p> <p>A Conservative government would set up a \u00a340m a year fund to help innovative charities and campaign groups step up the fight against global poverty, the shadow international development secretary, Andrew Mitchell, will announce today.</p> <p>In a move designed to illustrate the opposition's commitment to development, Mitchell will say that some of the money spent by the government in fast-growing countries such as China should be reallocated to seedcorn investment in projects struggling for cash. The fund would reward entrepreneurs devising novel ways of reaching the poor.</p> <p>\"We will invite British non-governmental organisations [NGOs] and charities to take the lead,\" Mitchell will say. \"They will come to us with plans to reduce poverty. The money will go to those proposals which are effective, accountable and focused towards clear, measurable outcomes.\"</p> <p>The Department for International Development currently funds a range of NGOs from its \u00a35.6bn budget, but Mitchell believes that the system is too bureaucratic and demand for government support exceeds supply. </p> <p>To balance risk in the portfolio, the so-called Poverty Impact Fund would also support well-established projects with a proven track record of reducing poverty. </p> <p><strong>Sharia courts</strong></p> <p>The Conservatives accused the government yesterday of being \"silent\" on sharia courts, which they said must be given no authority over criminal and family law matters in Britain.</p> <p>Dominic Grieve, the shadow home secretary, made the criticism as he warned that the government had neglected the threat of radicalisation. \"For all its tough talk on terrorism, the government is dropping the ball on security and radicalisation,\" Grieve said. \"Lax on fanatical preachers. Silent on sharia courts ... Sharia courts can be given no authority over criminal and family law.\"</p> <p>But Grieve, who told the Guardian last week that multiculturalism had downplayed the identity of \"long-term inhabitants and failed to provide a coherent identity for second and third-generation immigrants\", believes that sharia courts can have a role. He likens them to the Jewish Beth Din - acceptable because their rulings do not conflict with English law.</p>",

  "<p>David Cameron will today confront Gordon Brown's jibe that he is a novice unfit to become prime minister, when he declares that \"character and judgment\" are more important than experience.</p> <p>In his keynote speech to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/toryconference\">Conservative conference</a>, Cameron will attempt to demonstrate his mettle when he serves notice on his party that it should brace itself for a bruising start to government, which could even lead to tax rises.</p> <p>Cameron embarked on a major rewrite of his speech in the wake of the deepening global financial crisis. He also made an unscheduled speech yesterday offering the government bipartisan support.</p> <p>But the Tory leader will make it clear today that his bipartisan approach on the economy will not stop him challenging the prime minister when he hits backs at Brown's \"novice\" quip. Cameron will throw back at him what Brown regards as his own great strength - a decade of running the economy. \"To do difficult things for the long term, or even to get us through the financial crisis in the short term, it's not experience we need, it's character and judgment. To rebuild our economy, it's not more of the same we need, but change.\"</p> <p>Cameron will then depict Brown as a conservative as he accuses him in all but name of repeating John Major's mistake in 1997 of dismissing Tony Blair on the grounds that he had never held office. \"Experience is the argument of the incumbent over the ages,\" he will say. \"Experience is what they always say when they try to block change.\"</p> <p>Unlike last year, when Cameron walked around the stage and spoke without notes, the Tory leader will instead stand behind a lectern.</p> <p>In a speech shorn of jokes, a dour Cameron will make clear the Tory aspiration of an overall cut in taxes may have to wait a long time - and may even be replaced by tax rises. \"We will need to do difficult and unpopular things for the long term of the country,\" Cameron will say.</p> <p>Senior Tories acknowledge that the financial crisis presents them with a big challenge, because Brown may well be boosted as he presents himself as a serious and experienced figure best placed to deal with a global problem. But they believe that their formula for the economy - to ensure that public spending grows below the trend rate of economic growth over an economic cycle - is the correct approach in an uncertain period. But the aspiration - to use money saved by the new formula for eventual tax cuts - will have to be put on hold, because a Tory government would have to concentrate on paying off government borrowing and paying for increased welfare bills.</p> <p>Cameron will today describe his bipartisan approach as the best way of dealing with the crisis. \"We must set aside our differences and work together with the government in the short term to ensure stability. But that must not stop us telling the truth about the mistakes that have been made.\"</p> <p>Brown, enjoying a resurgence in his reputation as the man for a crisis, yesterday responded coolly to an offer of bipartisan support to rush through banking legislation to ease the crisis, as he rejected Tory proposals to suspend accountancy rules said to be acting as a downward death spiral on the value of assets.</p> <p>Cameron spoke to Brown late on Monday night to offer his party's support to push through a banking reform bill due to start its parliamentary proceedings on Monday. He said his party was dropping objections to aspects of the bill, and put forward new proposals to protect depositors.</p> <p>George Osborne, the shadow chancellor, yesterday rushed to a meeting with chancellor Alistair Darling in London. Both sides tried to adopt a spirit of inter-party unity in the face of the crisis, while retaining their distinctive policy positions.</p> <p>Cameron explained his bipartisan approach by saying: \"There well may need to be a marshalling of public support behind some big decisions.\"</p> <p>His remarks refer to fears that the HBOS-Lloyds deal may be renegotiated, because of the fall in HBOS shares, or that a bigger general bail-out may be required. Cameron warned that he was not offering a \"blank cheque\". At one point the Tories considered cancelling the conference in the face of the collapse in Wall Street.</p> <p>In a three-point package Cameron proposed extending protection for savers so that deposits up to \u00a350,000 at a failed bank, instead of the current \u00a335,000, are guaranteed by the state; a new power for a Bank of England-led reconstruction of failing banks as a way of protecting taxpayers' money; and a three-month suspension of \"mark to market\" rules that force banks to value all their assets at the price they would fetch if they sold them that day.</p>",
  "<p>When you analyse the parable, the good Samaritan's deed was not all that impressive. Its moral superiority came about because a priest and a Levite - biblical forerunners of today's walk-on-by society - had ignored the wounded man by the roadside while the Samaritan had stopped, tended to his wounds, taken care of him and paid for his accommodation. But he did not put his own life or safety at risk, and he made no great sacrifices. Had he come across the man while the robbers were still beating him up, would the Samaritan have intervened? Would the robbers have turned their violence on him? The Bible is silent. </p> <p>More would have been expected of him today. Our society, or rather that part of it still adhering to moral principles, would require him to rush to the aid of strangers being assaulted, robbed or molested, without thought of personal risk. If he spotted a theft or burglary he would confront the perpetrators; and he would intervene if he saw people fighting. Last Sunday, Frank McGarahan, a senior bank executive, tried bravely to stop a street brawl in Norwich and was beaten to death for his trouble. Yesterday, coincidentally, at the Conservative party conference, the shadow home secretary Dominic Grieve called for an end to the walk-on-by culture and promised that a Tory government would render have-a-go heroes immune from prosecution. He had in mind a number of cases where a well-meaning and courageous citizen doing his duty to society by attempting to stop or prevent a crime finds himself in the dock, perhaps accused of assault because he had laid a hand on the miscreant. A recent report by the thinktank Reform concluded that over-zealous application of the criminal law had made Britain a nation of passive bystanders. A survey showed that the British were less likely to intervene to stop a crime than the nationals of every other European country. Not a record to be proud of. Grieve is right to want to remove the injustice of a system which allows the laudable civic-minded citizen to be punished more severely than the criminals themselves. </p> <p>But removing the possibility of a prosecution might encourage more people to have a go. Is that desirable? It's all very well, in moral principle, to seek to persuade people witnessing crime to intervene, but it cannot be denied that it might mean endangering their lives or at least rendering them liable to injury. We already have a sad enough, lengthy list of those who have died or been severely harmed by being a good Samaritan Plus. They may be labelled have-a-go heroes, but that's of little consolation if they're not alive to enjoy the accolade. They would have been better off following the example of the priest and the Levite, who crossed the road rather than get involved.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>I had not expected such speedy proof of my (and Sir Tim Berners-Lee's) warning last week about the untrustworthiness of information garnered on the net. </p> <p>The web allows people to disseminate misleading information and tell deliberate lies, with possibly harmful results. Within a short time the falsity can have spread to thousands, even millions of recipients. And often the truth, when it emerges, does not reach those who were taken in by the lies. The day my column appeared - but definitely not as a consequence of it - I received, together with many others, an email from someone I know, containing the contents of another \"chain\" email, the crucial sentence of which is: \"This week the UK removed the Holocaust from its school curriculum because it 'offended' the Muslim population, which claims it never occurred.\" It goes on to describe itself as a \"memorial chain letter\"; \"Now, more than ever, with Iran among others claiming the Holocaust to be a myth, it is imperative to make sure the world never forgets.\" That key sentence is a complete lie. The Holocaust is a compulsory subject in the national curriculum, and I checked to make sure that there are no plans to shelve it. </p> <p>Anyway, surely the media would have been full of the story had it been true. But the fact is that many who read the lying email believed it, as did the friend who forwarded it to me, (until another recipient corrected him before I had a chance to). But who knows how many went on believing it, and forwarded it on to their friends, and so on? </p> <p>That email, it turned out, made its first appearance in April 2007, when it was duly exposed as a lie. It apparently surfaced again a few months later, before its most recent reappearance, and each time a large, if impossible to count, number of people, oblivious of official denials of the story, must have believed it. I have no idea who created the email, nor their intent, but the result could only have been to foment discord and suspicion between Jews - objecting to the alleged Muslim pressure to scrap lessons about the Holocaust - and Muslims, understandably reacting to the false allegations against them. And all this made possible only because of the existence of the web. </p> <p>There has been one slightly comical episode amid this depressing tale. An American reader of the offending email thought that the letters UK stood for University of Kentucky and spread the word according to his misunderstanding. The bemused university was eventually forced to issue a public denial that it had abandoned lectures on the Holocaust.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>This week Marcel saw <strong>Philippe Claudel's I've Loved You So Long</strong>: \"One of the finest French films of the past few years - sensitive and moving, with Kristin Scott Thomas giving the performance of her life.\" He watched <strong>TV coverage of the financial chaos</strong>: \"I remembered the words of my lecturer - 'in economics, no one can predict anything.'\"</p>",
  "<p>Your article on recent allegations of army bullying at Catterick garrison reports that a member of the defence select committee has called for investigations to be conducted by \"an independent body with teeth, away from the chain of command\" (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/sep/19/military.bbcdocumentary\">Corporals suspended over bullying claims</a>, September 19). This would be wrong.</p> <p>An independent body is not the best investigative tool where abuses in the military are concerned. Any examination of practices within the army must be undertaken, at least in part, by those who understand army practices.</p> <p>I was at one time an infantry recruit in the British army. In 1980, callow and fresh out of grammar school, I wanted to become a \"squaddie\". My background - rare among recruits of that era - meant I came in for some fearful abuse from my training corporals. They made my life hell. And that was part of their job.</p> <p>They realised that if I left training and went to my regiment with my grammar-school mores and methods still intact then I would not have lasted five minutes. They had to make me change - in essence, conform - while I was still in their \"care\". It was better by far that the corrective bullying be done by those training corporals rather than by others once in the regiment. I thank them for not having a \"zero tolerance of bullying\".</p> <p>The army needs soldiers who can hack it when the chips are down and who can put up with any amount of pain, discomfort, provocation and stress when they arrive in the Iraqs and Afghanistans of this world. Any recruit who cannot take \"instances of abuse\" in training should not be in the army. And those who cannot take the abuse will leave while still in training. Both the individual and the army are then better off.</p> <p>The army owes all its personnel a duty of care. No soldier, such as the anti-bullying campaigner Lynn Farr's son, should die in the manner in which he did. Nor should any soldier be \"punched, kicked, shaken, throttled ... urinated on [or] repeatedly hit\". But there is one place where the use of violence is acceptable. This is on military firing ranges, probably the most dangerous working environment anywhere. Mistakes are not infrequent even when trained soldiers are involved; but when recruits are let loose the danger is increased tenfold. It is simply not enough for any training corporal to verbally chastise a recruit who has come close to killing those around him by slack weapon-handling. Such chastisements often have little effect. </p> <p>Violence, in the form of single punch or kick, is a \"short, sharp shock\" perceived by many to be the only suitable remedial action. I am glad we still have training corporals who are prepared to put their own careers at risk by employing necessary measures that most would balk at.</p> <p>We would all like to live in a world where people are free from verbal and physical abuse at their place of work. But the army is not a high street bank or a burger bar. There has to be scope for different standards to apply.</p> <p>\u2022 Rod Thornton is a lecturer at the University of Nottingham's school of politics and international relations, and was formerly an infantry sergeant <a href=\"mailto:irt624@yahoo.co.uk\">irt624@yahoo.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Sometimes the signs are all there and it would be churlish to ignore them: last week, on three occasions, three of my cheffy friends - Sam Clark at Moro, Matt Cranston at The Anglesea Arms and Tom Pemberton at Hereford Road - cooked Grey leg partridge for me and others. Each tackled their birds with their own style and very yummy they all were too. Having not seen this most tasty of the small game birds for a year, it was the force of this fine triumvirate that made me joyfully pull up my woolly socks of seasonality and jump on board with the boys. </p> <p>In my recipe, the partridge is reunited with some of its hedgerow friends.</p> <p><strong>Serves two</strong></p> <p><strong>2 partridges, better not farmed (and Grey leg are considered better than Red), cleaned and gutted</strong></p> <p><strong>Few sprigs of thyme</strong></p> <p><strong>2 cloves garlic, unpeeled</strong></p> <p><strong>Splash of olive oil</strong></p> <p><strong>120g polenta (all polentas are different: I like the Bramata, coarse, slow-cooking one best - instant polenta lacks texture)</strong></p> <p><strong>Small bunch of sage, half roughly chopped and half whole leaf</strong></p> <p><strong>60g butter, plus a couple of knobs for inside the birds</strong></p> <p><strong>About a half a pint of milk</strong></p> <p><strong>Punnet of good blackberries</strong></p> <p><strong>Tumbler of red wine</strong></p> <p><strong>1\u00bd tbsp redcurrant jelly</strong></p> <p><strong>Splash of sherry vinegar</strong></p> <p><strong>Salt and pepper</strong></p> <p>Pre-heat the oven to 220C/430F.</p> <p>Choose a smallish thick-bottomed pan to make the polenta in. If it's slow-cooking then you need to get it on first. Melt half the butter until just fizzling, then gently fry the chopped sage in it for a minute or two. There will be instructions for the amount of liquid you need to use, so just scale down for the quantity of polenta in this recipe, and where they generally advise water, we will be using half milk and half water. </p> <p>Once the sage has released its aroma, pour in the milk and water. When steaming, but not boiling, slowly pour in the polenta while whisking it. Turn the heat right down and let the grains cook in the liquid, stirring regularly, which could take anything from 12-30 minutes, depending on the kind of polenta used. </p> <p>If it starts to go cementy, a hefty splash of milk followed by vigorous whisking will restore the creaminess. Season with salt and pepper. When your polenta is 20 minutes away from being ready, stuff the thyme, garlic and a knob of butter inside each bird, and season inside and out with salt and pepper. Put an oven-proof frying pan on a high heat and melt the rest of the butter with a splash of plain olive oil. </p> <p>Once hot, put the birds in the pan, breast side down. Brown them well on both breasts, then turn them over and pop them in the oven. After 15 minutes take the pan out, put it over a medium heat on the hob, and remove the birds, resting them breast side down covered with foil on a plate for the five minutes it takes to finish the sauce.</p> <p>Fry the whole sage leaves in the pan for just a minute, then take them out and put next to the birds. Pour in the wine and a splash of sherry vinegar followed by the blackberries.</p> <p>Give the berries a good roll around as the wine reduces to a saucy consistency, then stir in the redcurrant jelly until it melts.</p> <p>Turn the heat off, season the sauce, give your polenta one last taste and consistency check, restoring it to full creamy potential with a splash of milk if necessary and serve on big, warmed plates: first the beautiful soft polenta, bird on top, sauce and berries all around and the sage leaves to finish.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Allegra McEvedy is co-founder of the fast-food chain, Leon.</p>",
  "<p>Vinton Gray \"Vint\" Cerf is a very distinguished, kindly, silver-haired gentleman in a three-piece suit, so perhaps I shouldn't expect him to ride to our rescue with six guns blazing, but I'd settle for a small pearl-handled silver pistol. I want to know who is going to clean up the internet now that it's full of scammers, spammers and criminals running zombie networks, while its connecting pipes are clogged up with porn-to-porn file swapping.</p> <p>Sadly, Cerf doesn't have a silver bullet, either. \"It's every man for himself,\" he says, grinning. \"In the end, it seems every machine has to defend itself. The internet was designed that way.\"</p> <p><strong>Aiming high</strong></p> <p>And he should know. In the early 1970s, Cerf co-designed the TCP/IP protocol suite on which internet communications are based, and was founding president of the Internet Society.</p> <p>He led the team that engineered the first email service to run over the internet; he chaired Icann, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers; and he has been working with Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory on the Interplanetary Internet (<a href=\"http://www.bit.ly/vint2\">bit.ly/vint2</a>). It may be a case of \"tomorrow, the stars\", but the here-and-now can seem a bit of a mess.</p> <p>Cerf points out that \"like every medium, the internet can be abused. When we think about it, we can commit fraud locally and internationally using the telephone system and postal service. We can perpetrate a variety of crimes, and in every instance where we have had a technology like that, ultimately society has said: 'There are certain constraints, certain behaviours we will consider to be antisocial. We may not be able to prevent this happening, but we will choose to have consequences if we catch you.' </p> <p>\"This question comes up annually at the internet governance meetings. So I won't be surprised if there are national and international agreements reached about certain unacceptable behaviours on the net, and they will be enforced to one degree or another.\"</p> <p>However, Cerf is also convinced that it's the internet's openness - in allowing people with new ideas to do their thing without getting anyone's permission - that is the main source of its power.</p> <p>\"So I have this almost schizoid hope that we deal with some of the abuses in the net and, at the same time, we don't lose this very open environment, so that information-sharing remains as open as it has been,\" he says.</p> <p>One example is Google, a company that Cerf - now 65 - joined three years ago as Chief Internet Evangelist. \"Google wouldn't exist if Larry [Page] and Sergey [Brin] hadn't just built this thing and tried it out. The same is true with Jerry [Yang, co-founder] at Yahoo,\" says Cerf.</p> <p>The internet hardly needs an evangelist now. However, it still needs defending, and Cerf has been putting the case for \"net neutrality\" - a hot topic for US politicians, who are being lobbied by the phone companies. </p> <p>\"We're expecting new legislation,\" he says. \"I think there should be very strong measures to prevent anti-competitive actions, so I'm actually very sanguine about the passing of legislation in the United States.\"</p> <p><strong>Traffic cops</strong></p> <p>He says Google's aim is to ensure open communications, which means equally open to different technologies and different types of traffic. However, limiting the amount of traffic each person uses is a different matter. \"As long as you get the capacity you're paying for, that's a form of fairness,\" says Cerf. \"It's orthogonal to net neutrality.\"</p> <p>As the publicly recognised \"father of the internet\" and winner of a Turing and other awards, Cerf also opens doors for Google. Last Wednesday he spent the morning talking at the British Computer Society before visiting the Guardian for a Q&amp;A with a couple of dozen staff over a sandwich lunch. He started out by showing us his dancing programmable Sony MP3 player, Rolly, which shows we can now put computer power wherever we need it, he says. It's really an ice-breaker to show he's not stuffy.</p> <p>Suffice it to say that Cerf doesn't think the net will be brought to its knees either by botnets or spam. \"Spam is a problem, but we can filter it,\" he says, and its demands on capacity are \"small relative to the bits carrying images and video\". As for the zombies, he points out that \"the botnet herders don't want to destroy the internet: they need it to make a living. We may not think it's acceptable, but that's their motivation.\"</p> <p>He also doesn't think the net is going to exhibit any form of consciousness. \"I don't believe we will see grow out of the network the kind of intelligence that sounds like a Fred Hoyle science fiction novel,\" he says. However, \"even if the internet is not intelligent and aware, it will feel more intelligent than it does today. But it's fair to say that if you want the system to do things you care about, you have to let it know what you care about. You have to give up some information voluntarily.\"</p> <p><strong>House of cards</strong></p> <p>Afterwards, over a coffee, I raise the spectre of the \"two-tier internet\" that some companies would like. There could be, for example, a trusted, controlled \"overnet\" for commercial and business use, and an \"undernet\" where anything goes. </p> <p>\"It's probably not wise to design systems that assume that a particular subset is trusted,\" says Cerf. \"I don't mean to say you shouldn't try, but every machine that can be compromised is a potential hazard. A machine that was OK yesterday is certainly not OK today: it may have ingested an infected memory stick. At the very least, you have to keep validating it. My bias right now tends to be 'It's every man for himself' - you need to be suspicious whether you're inside the trusted cloud or not, and when it fails, the house of cards tends to collapse.\"</p> <p>But the continuous validation of known sources is not something for which the internet provides much help. \"The idea of a virtual private network was not part of the original design,\" says Cerf, with a grin. \"It was actually an oversight. It didn't occur to me that it would be useful until afterwards.\"</p> <p>Of course, no one foresaw just how big, or how pervasive, the internet was going to become. In the end, we should probably be grateful the designers opted not for control but for freedom.</p> <h2>Curriculum Vitae</h2> <p><strong>Age</strong> 65</p> <p><strong>Education</strong> Graduated Stanford University, 1965, BS in Mathematics; MS in Computer Science, UCLA; PhD in Computer Science, UCLA</p> <p><strong>Career</strong></p> <p><strong>Includes</strong> assistant professor, Stanford University; US Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA); vice-president, MCI; founding president of the Internet Society; visiting scientist, Nasa; chairman, ICANN; chief internet evangelist, Google</p> <p><strong>Family</strong> Married to Sigrid; two sons</p>",
  "<h2>Two-pronged approach</h2> <p>Landscape purists really object to wind farms. But up with them in the Public Enemy No 1 bracket are those ecologically barren conifer forests that blanket so much of Wales and Scotland. There will be delight and horror, then, that Npower Renewables is planning a huge wind farm for Carnedd Wen on the southern edge of Snowdonia. Here the company wants to erect 65 of the tallest turbines ever seen in Britain. But, being clever, the company is also proposing, as part of the same scheme, one of the largest habitat restoration projects Wales has ever seen. Most of the trees in Llanbrynmair Forest will be felled to restore what was once the finest peat bog in Wales. If all goes to plan, ramblers' boots will squelch and the black grouse and the persecuted hen harrier will soon start to breed again.

That's what 30 of the world's leading Base (building, antenna, span and earth) folk did this weekend at Swaffham, Norfolk, parachuting off Ecotricity's 60-metre turbine.</p> <h2>Sound check</h2> <p>What caused the stranding of 26 common dolphins - the highest recorded in the UK - near St Anthony in Cornwall in June? The finger of blame is pointing at the Ministry of Defence which has confirmed, in a freedom of information request from the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society and others, that military sonar was being used by 31 vessels during the south coast naval exercises until the day of the stranding. Military sonar has been linked to whale strandings: impacts may include disorientation and flight from the noise source, leading to strandings, as well as decompression sickness similar to \"the bends\" in humans.</p> <h2>Glass half full</h2> <p>Compare and contrast the optimism of Neil Parish, Tory MEP for the south-west, with the reality of life at the grassroots. \"It's great to see thriving vineyards in Devon,\" he said this week. \"I am confident that we will start seeing many more vineyards and many more fine English wines coming out of the West Country.\" A random phone call to a Devon vineyard suggests it's not as simple as that. \"It was a very, very wet year,\" said the owner, who had just brought in a diminished harvest that he can barely sell. \"We had frost at bud time, and then we had wet and windy weather at flower time. So production was right down. Last year, we had a bad harvest and we thought it could not get any worse. Well, it did.\"</p> <h2>Tall orders</h2> <p>Back to wind. The Ramblers' Association is furious at the flood of wind farm applications coming in. \"Three times the number of wind farms are planned for England and Wales than already exist, mainly concentrated in areas of exceptional natural beauty. In Scotland, 12 separate wind farm proposals will create a 'ring of steel' around the Cairngorms national park which will be visible from the summits.\"</p> <h2>Quote of the month</h2> <p>Miguel d'Escoto Brockmann, the Nicaraguan priest who is president of the UN general assembly, talking recently in front of world leaders on the Millennium Development Goals: \"The essential purpose of food, which is to nourish people, has been subordinated to the economic aims of a handful of multinational corporations that monopolise all aspects of food production, from seeds to major distribution chains, and they have been the prime beneficiaries of the world crisis. A look at the figures for 2007, when the world food crisis began, shows that corporations such as Monsanto and Cargill, which control the cereals market, saw their profits increase by 45% and 60%, respectively; the leading chemical fertiliser companies, such as Mosaic Corporation, a subsidiary of Cargill, doubled their profits in a single year.\"</p>",
  "<p>Esa-Pekka Salonen's strongest suit is 20th-century music. This provincial programme was designed to show that the new principal conductor of the Philharmonia is no slouch in the standard romantic repertory, either - though, in the end, the evening was shaped by events entirely beyond his control.</p> <p>The atmosphere inside Leeds Town Hall was so stiflingly hot that towards the end of the second movement of Beethoven's Piano Concerto No 4, a woman sitting in the choir stalls passed out. Salonen silenced the orchestra, then turned and inquired whether there was a doctor in the house. He and the soloist, Helen Grimaud, resumed by skipping forward to the final movement when, incredibly, a second audience member fainted and had to be carried out. Leeds Town Hall has recently undergone a \u00a34m refurbishment. Did this not include air conditioning?</p> <p>It was not as though the heat was being generated from the platform. Until the interruption, the performance seemed distinctly lethargic, Grimaud dispatching florid roulades with much facility, but sounding rather mechanical. The off-stage events seemed to pump some drama into the performance: the orchestra's adrenaline began to flow and some fine musicality ensued, though Salonen raced through the Rondo as if anxious to reach the end without further disaster.</p> <p>Berlioz's Symphonie Fantastique is not the piece you want to tackle with rattled nerves. The quixotically structured opium dream easily becomes inchoate, and though Salonen's performance had its moments, it sounded overall like a sequence of five overtures for a main event that never arrived. As the great battery of timpani rolled out their thunder, you desperately wanted a strike of lightning to clear the air.</p>",
  "<p>Scientists have uncovered an ancient and elaborate source of pain relief that is based purely on the power of the mind, according to research published today.</p> <p>Brain scans of volunteers who were subjected to electrical shocks revealed that Roman Catholics felt less pain than atheists and agnostics when they were shown a painting of the Virgin Mary. </p> <p>Images of the volunteers' brains showed that in devout believers, an area of the brain that suppresses reactions to threatening situations lit up when they were shown the picture.</p> <p>Researchers at Oxford University, led by Katja Wiech, recruited 12 nonbelievers and 12 practising Roman Catholic students. In the tests, participants were shown either an image of the Virgin Mary by the 17th-century Italian painter Sassoferrato or Leonardo da Vinci's 15th-century Lady with an Ermine. After looking at the picture for 30 seconds, the volunteers were zapped with electrical pulses for 12 seconds. Each time, they were asked to rank how painful the shocks were on a scale of zero to 100.</p> <p>The researchers describe how Roman Catholics and nonbelievers reported similar levels of pain after viewing the Leonardo painting. But the two groups responded very differently to the Virgin Mary painting, with Catholics experiencing 12% less pain.</p> <p>When Wiech's team looked at the brain scans of the two groups, they found marked differences between them. After seeing the Virgin Mary, an area in the brain called the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex lit up in the religious volunteers. </p> <p>\"The Roman Catholics engaged a brain mechanism that is well known from research into the placebo effect, analgesia and emotional disengagement,\" said Wiech. \"It helps people to reinterpret pain, and make it less threatening. These people felt safe by looking at the Virgin Mary, they felt looked after, so the whole context of the test changed for them.\" </p> <p>It is highly likely that non-religious people could achieve a similar ability to control pain, perhaps through meditation or other mental strategies. \"There's no suggestion that this effect is specific to religion and we've not found the God blob in the brain. This is about the state of mind you can achieve,\" said Wiech. </p> <p>Preliminary studies on lapsed Catholics suggest that images of the Virgin Mary lessen their sense of pain too, the researchers said.</p>",
  "<p>It was the best speech David Cameron has ever made. It had weight, gravitas and real content. Of course it was as sodden with political calculation as a rich tea biscuit under Niagara Falls, but the great art of such a speech is to appear above politics while scrapping like a maniac for political advantage.</p> <p>The Tory leader was making his bid for a government of national unity, in which he will stand alongside the prime minister. He will join this great statesman to heal our wounded nation and restore our sick economy. </p> <p>Together they will bring us to uplands so sunlit they will make the meadow in Millais's The Blind Girl - one of the great attractions in the Birmingham art gallery - look like a sink estate in the rain.</p> <p>This afternoon, when the Tory leader makes his main conference speech, Gordon Brown will have became a figure of ridicule, hatred and contempt, as fit to run our country as Victor Meldrew with the PG Tips chimps as his cabinet. But for one day only he was invited to join Team Tory to work together, for us, for our country, for the future, for our children (fill in your own vague aspiration here).</p> <p>Mr Cameron marched on stage, impromptu and almost unheralded. He thrashed his face into an expression of anguished concern. He was trying to out-grim George Osborne and almost succeeded.</p> <p>People were worried about their jobs, their mortgages, their savings, their pensions. He had a solution for getting out of the mess, and will tell us what it is today. In the meantime, he said, we must not let anger cloud our judgment.</p> <p>This was the tricky bit: how to blame the bankers without blaming the free market system which they appear to be testing to destruction. He answered in two parts: (1) they must pay for their evil misdeeds. (2) But not yet. \"There will be a day of reckoning, but today is not that day!\" I rather hoped he would tell us what the day would be - February 23, 2011, for example. </p> <p>Then the cunning sleight of hand. \"We cannot allow what happened in America to happen here.\" In other words, unlike those pesky Republicans, we will not play party politics. But the system is different here. Gordon Brown has far more power over Britain than George Bush has over America. </p> <p>He can do what he likes! He doesn't need David Cameron. Even if he came up with some entirely hare-brained scheme, such as paying public sector workers in Tesco club card points, he could get it through the Commons.</p> <p>Mr Cameron told us that the Tories agreed with the government that there had to be new legislation to rescue failing banks. They only disagreed about who should decide to use it. \"I can announce today that we are prepared to drop our objection to allow rapid and safe passage of the bill!\"</p> <p>He made the bill sound like Lenin in the sealed train speeding towards Moscow. The fact is that Labour could get it through even if next week the Tories decided to go on holiday to the Maldives while they've still got any money.</p>",
  "<p>Syrian and Lebanese political leaders have traded angry accusations after terrorist bombings in both countries fuelled fears of a new crisis between them.</p> <p>Saad Hariri, leader of the western-backed Sunni Future Movement, lashed out at Bashar al-Assad after the Syrian president warned that northern Lebanon had become \"a base for extremism and constitutes a danger for Syria\".</p> <p>Hariri retorted that it was Syria that was \"a clear and direct threat\" to Lebanon, bluntly accusing Damascus of \"infiltrating extremists to north Lebanon to carry out terrorist attacks targeting the Lebanese army and civilians\". Last week thousands of Syrian troops reportedly gathered on Lebanon's northern border, sparking concerns of a large-scale incursion.</p> <p>Seven Lebanese, including four soldiers, died on Monday in a bus bomb attack in Tripoli, the country's second-largest city. Similar to a bombing in August, it was widely blamed on Fatah al-Islam, an extremist Sunni group the Lebanese military fought last year in a nearby Palestinian refugee camp, Nahr el-Bared. Lebanese sources insisted it has, or had, links to Syrian intelligence.</p> <p>On Saturday, 17 people died in a suicide car bombing near Damascus - Syria's worst terrorist incident in more than 20 years. Officials said it had been carried out by a \"Takfiri\" group - standard terminology for al-Qaida - and hinted that the perpetrators came from Iraq, where the US military \"surge\" has put al-Qaida under pressure. </p> <p>Analysts suggested the Damascus attack may have been an act of retaliation, after the Syrian government, anxious to improve its image in the west, tightened control of its long border with Iraq. The apparent target was a Syrian intelligence office near the Shia shrine of Sayyida Zeynab, where many Iraqi refugees live. </p> <p>Syrian opposition sources have claimed that one of the victims was an intelligence officer, fuelling speculation about whether the bombing was linked to some internal squabble.</p> <p>\"It is possible that there is no connection between the incidents in Tripoli and Damascus,\" said Nadim Shehadi, a Middle East expert at Chatham House in London. \"But the perception in Lebanon is that terrorists who cross the border and blow themselves up are sent from Damascus. And in Syria, they are keen to show that Lebanon cannot function without them and that when they were in charge there they managed to keep a lid on all these terrorist groups.\"</p> <p>Assad's comments have heightened concerns that Syria could have designs on its smaller neighbour. </p> <p>In Beirut, Hariri denounced the deployment of Syrian troops along Lebanon's northern borders. He urged the international community not to allow Syria to intervene in Lebanese affairs under the guise of fighting extremism.</p>",

  "<p>The media regulator could force BSkyB to broaden the distribution of its premium sports and movie channels. </p> <p>Ofcom yesterday published its second pay TV consultation and proposed to introduce a new mechanism to ensure the channels are available to its rivals at a fair price, to stimulate competition and innovation in the market. </p> <p>The move, which could lead to lower prices for viewers, is the latest stage in a long running investigation prompted by complaints from BT, Setanta, Top Up TV and Virgin Media in 2007 that BSkyB exerted a \"vicious circle of control\" over the market. They claimed BSkyB, which has dominated live coverage of Premier League football since 1992 and has deals with all four big Hollywood studios, was limiting distribution and setting prices above a competitive level. </p> <p>The regulator yesterday agreed that distribution of the channels was \"limited\" and dismissed BSkyB's argument that the definition of the market should be broadened to include free-to-air television.</p> <p>Ofcom was unable to come to a conclusion on overpricing, but did find that Sky was making a bigger margin from its premium channels than from the rest of its business.</p> <p>Since an Office of Fair Trading investigation that concluded in 2002, BSkyB has abided by the principles of its ruling in its dealings with cable companies.

  "<p>Like a reluctant witness after a shoot-out, Andr\u00e9 Previn peers around the door of his flat, gripping the door frame and watching me approach down the dim corridor. We're high in a portered block on Manhattan's Upper East Side where Previn - tiny, beaky, full of amused dismay at the world and the generally unsatisfactory nature of the people in it - lives when he isn't touring. Inside, a grand piano takes up most of the living room. How ever did they get it up here? Previn blinks, as if he had never considered it. \"I have no idea.\"</p> <p>The composer will be 80 next year, the age of lifetime achievement awards, which sometimes feel to him like obituaries and make him want to scream: \"But I'm still working!\" There was the Glenn Gould prize and the honorary knighthood, and now Gramophone magazine is giving him a gong for outstanding contribution to the something or other. \"It's not the Pulitzer prize and it's not the Nobel prize and it's not the Drama Critics prize. Still, it's very nice of Gramophone, which I've read all my life.\" His voice is high and dreamy and slightly arcane-sounding, like the Tin Man's. \"I don't,\" he says, \"tend to take myself all that seriously,\" though there is an edge to his teasing that I wouldn't like to see fully blown.</p> <p>The work hasn't let up. The day after we meet, Previn will fly to Munich to perform with his fifth and (to date) final ex-wife, Anne-Sophie Mutter, the violinist he rather sweetly calls \"my best friend\". He is conducting the London Symphony Orchestra at Christmas and has a new opera opening in Houston in the spring. Based on Brief Encounter, it uses some of No\u00ebl Coward's original script together with a libretto by the British writer John Caird - a return in spirit, perhaps, to Previn's first career as a film scorer at MGM. Between 1958 and 1964 he won four Academy awards for his original music, including work on Gigi and Porgy &amp; Bess. But no, he says, writing Brief Encounter was not like writing a film score. \"Do you know I haven't set foot in a movie studio in, wait a second, 30 ... in 43 years? There is a statute of limitations. People shouldn't bring it up.\" He smiles dangerously.</p> <p>Lots of other things annoy Previn. Travel: \"That bloody airport. You get shunted around. Too awful.\" Technology: \"I don't even have a cell phone. I don't know how they work.\" The marketing of classical music. He is particularly irritated by Lang Lang, the hugely successful Chinese pianist who throws himself about at the piano like Elton John. \"It's a circus act, you know? Why doesn't he just come out and juggle? He's an amazing pianist, but I can't watch, not for one minute. And yet he is probably the biggest box-office success in the world, for a classical musician.\" Mind you, he says, there have always been people willing to muck around to get publicity. \"And sometimes, in the case of Bernstein - well, even there, I wasn't all that crazy about it, but I thought the music-making was quite remarkable.\" He doesn't think Lang Lang will last. \"People will get tired of all the shenanigans.\"</p> <p>Previn's disdain for showing off comes from his 16 years in Hollywood. He joined MGM while still a schoolboy in Los Angeles, in 1946, and turned down the offer of finishing his education at the studio's in-house school, where he would have been a classmate of Liz Taylor's. He had come to the attention of the music department after doing arrangements for a local radio show. Though the adolescent Previn was awestruck by the studio, even then something in him militated against being wholly consumed by it.</p> <p>For the next 16 years he scored dozens of movies with what he calls \"commercial cornball music\". He made good money and had a secure job. But he felt trapped, and his father, who had his own demons, thought he was wasting his talent. The family, who were Jewish, had been forced to flee the Nazis when Previn was 10, leaving everything behind in Germany, most problematically his father's career as a successful barrister. In his new country he became a piano teacher. \"My father couldn't practise law because he didn't know the language. I never realised until much later in my life that he was really quite a hero. He left Germany, didn't have a dime, didn't speak the language, had a family, and yet he managed to get us through it. That was an act of heroism. But I never got along with him all that well.\"</p> <p>Previn also realised after the fact that his own success at MGM must have been difficult for his father. \"Because I was working hard and I was making strides. And he wasn't. But he was a remarkable man.\"</p> <p>And his mother?</p> <p>\"And my mother - \" He smiles. \"I could do no wrong.\"</p> <p>At the age of 32, to the horror of his peers, Previn resigned from the studio to concentrate on his classical career. \"At MGM you knew you were going to be working next year, you knew you were going to get paid. But I was too ambitious musically to settle for it. And I wanted to gamble with whatever talent I might have had.\"</p> <p>His faith in himself was, of course, borne out. But though he admits he was cocky, he says he has never become an intolerable egotist, not the stereotypical maestro. \"When you're working with music that is invariably better than you are, it's difficult to become swell-headed.\" He chuckles. \"It's true.\"</p> <p>There were a few wilderness years before his big break at the Houston Symphony Orchestra and, from there, his 11-year tenure as principal conductor at the LSO. He wound up living back in Germany at one point, which I imagine was difficult. German is his first language (French his second, English his third) and he still uses it for the alphabet, days of the week and basic arithmetic. But there must, surely, have been bitterness towards the country to overcome? There is a long pause. \"No. I was - I was selfish enough and then realistic enough to know that as a musician I really had to go back there. It never bothered me. I mean, I'm aware of it. But it never bothered me in terms of, 'What did they do to my family?' No. It's not a big drama.\"</p> <p>It is England he misses now. He lived there with Mia Farrow, his third wife, for most of the 1970s, in an idyllic house in Surrey. (\"Not in the stockbroker part.\") Those were the glory years, when the LSO was frequently on television and Previn's youthful looks and shaggy hair became well known. Astonishingly, he and the orchestra made an average of 14 albums a year. \"And now it's two. Somebody told me classical records constitute less than 1% of the sales of records. So I say, let's not even talk about doing a Tchaikovsky symphony. Let's do some Tippett or some Messiaen, or something. But then, who the hell is going to buy that? Nobody buys anything any more. It's all a crapshoot.\"</p> <p>It is sometimes claimed that the best classical composers are working in the film industry: Morricone, John Williams, even Andrew Lloyd Webber. Previn worked on the scoring for the film version of Jesus Christ Superstar, as a favour to his friend Norman Jewison, who directed. \"I'm not a great fan of Lloyd Webber's. He doesn't need me to be a fan. Believe me.\" And the others? He winces. \"John Williams is without question talented. He writes very good scores and very good melodies and all that. But, no, of the others ... You know, when I hear Titanic - James Horner - which was a huge hit, it's the same 16 bars played 185 times. It's not interesting.\" His favourite composer of theatre music is Harold Arlen; his favourite lyricist is Sondheim; beyond that, there isn't much to excite him in musical theatre these days. \"Those awful Disney musicals - mermaids with long eyelashes, that's not interesting.\"</p> <p>Orchestras have changed, too. In the 1970s the LSO players were, says Previn, \"pretty much of a rowdy crowd. Going on a tour with them was unbelievable. There was a great deal of inimitably great playing, and also astonishingly bad behaviour.\" He lights up at the memory and says it was like being on a school trip. \"And now they show up in a suit. They play fabulously well, but ... \" He tails off. Even at their rowdiest, the LSO never gave him a hard time, even though he was young and relatively inexperienced. \"No. It's only when they think you're faking that they can't forgive you. That's good. I agree with that.\"</p> <p>Those years in London and Surrey were some of the happiest of his life. Previn and Farrow had six children, three of whom they adopted from the far east. Despite his European sensibility, he found England occasionally mystifying. Previn belonged to the Garrick club, and one day the secretary invited him to bring Farrow to dinner there. \"I said, 'OK, I'll tell her, she might enjoy it very much.' He said, 'Yes, oh and by the way, you must forgive me for this but she can't use the main staircase. The women have to go round the back.' And I said, 'What?' And I went home and told Mia and she said, 'You have 10 minutes in which to quit the club.' And I said, 'I've already done it.' Unbelievable. Mia was the wrong person to try that on.\"</p> <p>They are still friends; he sees her frequently in New York. One of his children rings during the interview, and while speaking to her his accent becomes noticeably more American. \"Darling, no, I'm fine. I'm fine, honey. Oh yes. Thanks a lot, honey. Do that, sweetie. All right, darlin'. Bye bye.\" He admires his ex-wife a lot. \"She goes to Darfur like other people go to New Jersey. She does a lot of good there.\"</p> <p>One of his sons is a rock guitarist who took up the instrument because it was one of the few his father had no knowledge of. \"I couldn't blame him.\" He plays for an obscure group, but is very successful, says Previn. \"Because when I say successful I mean he plays well and he likes what he's playing. That's success.\"</p> <p>The last time he heard a piece of new music that really set him on fire was when he was a teenager, listening to Bart\u00f3k's Concerto for Orchestra. But he still gets excited at new renditions of old pieces; he heard Benjamin Britten's Peter Grimes at the Metropolitan Opera House last month - \"That just floored me. My God, what a piece.\" Does it depress him, the gap between the ideal of how a piece of music might be and what it is in reality? \"It can't be helped. It works in both directions. I sometimes hear a piece of mine and there will be moments in it that are better than I thought they'd be. And then there will be moments when I think I should have done better. The only thing that always works is mediocrity. As soon as you try for the bull's eye you could also miss the whole target.\"</p> <p>And has he had many misses?</p> <p>\"Oh, darling, are you kidding? Any number of things. But I've written some things I like. I quite liked Streetcar. I hope I like Brief Encounter. I love the violin concerto that I wrote for Anne-Sophie. I like my quartet.\" Next, he'd like to do an opera for A Man for All Seasons. \"We'll see.\"</p> <p>And regrets? A big sigh. \"Privately, yes. I've made some very poor choices in my private life. But as a professional, no, not really.\"</p> <p>A few years ago, he took a drive past his old house in Surrey. He saw that the new owner had subdivided his beloved woods at the back into nine separate lots. It was unbelievably painful. \"I thought, I can't see this.\" And he vowed, as he tends to, not to go back.</p>",
  "<p><strong>The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Friday November 28 2008</strong></p> <p>In the article below, we describe the geophysicist Professor Syun-Ichi Akasofu as a founding director of the Heartland Institute. In fact he has never held any formal position with the US thinktank.</p> <p> </p> <p>The Republican <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/sarahpalin\">Sarah Palin</a> and her officials in the Alaskan state government drew on the work of at least six scientists known to be sceptical about the dangers and causes of global warming, to back efforts to stop polar bears being protected as an endangered species, the Guardian can disclose. Some of the scientists were funded by the oil industry. </p> <p>In official submissions to the US government's consultation on the status of the polar bear, Palin and her team referred to at least six scientists who have questioned either the existence of warming as a largely man-made phenomenon or its severity. One paper was partly funded by the US oil company ExxonMobil.</p> <p>The status of the polar bear has become a battleground in the debate on global warming. In May the US department of the interior rejected Palin's objections and listed the bear as a threatened species, saying that two-thirds of the world's polar bears were likely to be extinct by 2050 due to the rapid melting of the sea ice. Palin, governor of Alaska and the Republican nominee for US vice-president, responded last month by suing the federal government, to try to overturn the ruling. The case will be heard in January.</p> <p>Though the state of Alaska has no polar bear specialists on its staff, the governor's stance has pitted it against the combined scientific fire-power of the US Fish and Wildlife Service, the US Geological Survey, and world experts on the mammal.</p> <p>In its lawsuit, Alaska said it opposed the endangered label partly because the listing would \"deter activities such as ... oil and gas exploration and development\". Oil companies recently bid $2.7bn (\u00a31.5bn) for rights to explore the Chuckchi sea, an established polar bear habitat.</p> <p>The threatened species status might also impede the building of an Alaskan natural gas pipeline, which Palin has called the \"will of God\". In a letter last year to the US interior secretary, Dirk Kempthorne, she said she believed the polar bear population was \"abundant, stable and unthreatened by direct human activity\". She opposed the call for the listing because it \"did not use the best available scientific and commercial information\".</p> <p>Her own Alaskan review of the science drew on a joint paper by seven authors, four of whom were well-known climate- change contrarians. Her paper argued that it was \"certainly premature, if not impossible\" to link temperature rise in Alaska with human CO2 emissions.</p> <p>The paper, entitled Polar Bears of Western Hudson Bay and Climate Change, has been criticised for relying on old research and ignoring evidence that Arctic sea-ice is melting at a quickening pace. Walt Meier, a world authority on sea ice, based at the National Snow and Ice Data Centre, said: \"The paper doesn't measure up scientifically.\"</p> <p>One co-author of the paper, Willie Soon, completed the study with funding from ExxonMobil - which has oil operations in Alaska's North Slope - as well as from the American Petroleum Institute. Soon was a former senior scientist with the George C Marshall Institute, which acts as an incubator for climate-change scepticism. The institute has received $715,000 in funding from ExxonMobil since 1998. </p> <p>In May, ExxonMobil announced that it was no longer funding Marshall and other groups linked with contrarian views. It said this was to avoid \"distraction from the need to provide energy while reducing greenhouse gas emissions\" and stressed that the company did not \"control the research itself\".</p> <p>Another co-author of the document was Sallie Baliunas. In 2003 she and Soon were criticised when it was revealed that a joint paper had been partially funded by the American Petroleum Institute. Thirteen scientists whom they cited issued a rebuttal and several editors of the journal Climate Research resigned because of the \"flawed peer review\". A third co-author of the polar bear study, David Legates, a professor at Delaware University, is also associated with the Marshall Institute.</p> <p>The citation by Palin and her officials prompted complaints from Congress. One member, Brad Miller, dubbed the polar bear study phony science. </p> <p>Palin told Miller: \"Attempts to discredit scientists ... simply because their analyses do not agree with your views, would be a disservice to this country.\" Miller now says that Palin's use of the paper shows she differs greatly from John McCain, the Republican presidential contender, who has pressed for scientific integrity. \"Turning to the cottage industry of scientists who are funded because they spread doubt about global warming is not integrity,\" Miller said.</p> <p>Palin's submission consulted J Scott Armstrong, a specialist in forecasting, who regards the global warming issue as \"public hysteria\". </p> <p>Two other contrarian scholars were cited. One was Syun-Ichi Akasofu, formerly director of the International Arctic Research Centre, in Alaska, who argues that climate change could be a hangover from the little ice age. He is a founding director of the Heartland Institute, a thinktank that has received $676,500 from ExxonMobil since 1998. </p> <p>Timothy Ball, a retired professor from Winnipeg, is cited for his climate and polar bear research. He has called human-made global warming \"the greatest deception in the history of science\". He has worked with both Friends of Science, and the Natural Resources Stewardship Project, which each had funding from energy firms. </p> <p>Kert Davies, research director at Greenpeace US, said the state of Alaska under Palin's leadership had relied on scholars who argue the opposite view to that of the overwhelming consensus in the scientific community. \"It shows that she is completely out of touch with the urgency of the climate crisis.\"</p> <p>Last month Palin agreed that the Alaskan climate was changing but added: \"I'm not one though who would attribute it to being man-made.\" She later tried to retract the statement.</p>",
  "<p>The welfare state was built to tackle the \"five giants\" of squalor, sickness, ignorance, idleness and want. These were concerns about basic human needs brought on by the economic depression of the 1930s.</p> <p>What was not contained in the original 1942 Beveridge report was a focus on people living meaningful lives, with ambition and aspiration, beyond the baseline of basic standards. Welfare was about safety, survival and security, not about what we might now call self-actualisation.</p> <p>This is the \"sixth giant\" and a good example is the government's Every Child Matters policy, which emphasises that all children and young people should be able to achieve, to have ambition and to be active contributing citizens. Similar values are enshrined in its policies for people with a learning disability, and disabled and older people. </p> <p>So what should this mean for policy? First, we must ditch the Poor Law legacies of postcode lotteries and eligibility criteria, and move to a nationally consistent system of providing help so that regardless of location the same level of assistance is provided. Moving around the country, for example, to be nearer to family and friends, would not be so daunting if the fear of help being withdrawn was not an issue.</p> <p>Second, create a system where the care needed determines the level of assistance, rather than the amount of money left half way through a council's financial year. This requires moving away from cash-capped budgets to an entitlement to funding based on need.</p> <p>Third, replace the current wasteful arrangement of 150 councils in England (and 22 in Wales and 32 in Scotland) all inventing their own policies to determine who gets help. </p> <p>Fourth, spend less time rationing and restricting assistance, and more time helping disabled and older people achieve their ambitions. Councils should be opportunity creators; social workers should be advocates and advisers to those who need assistance.</p> <p>It is not necessary to invent a wheel to deliver this radical new care and support system. The government and the other major political parties are heavily committed to disabled and older people having more choice and control in their lives, and with a major say about how money for their help will be spent. But the ways of making this happen, ranging from direct payments of cash by local councils to \"individual budgets\", have become too complex and wasteful.</p> <p>A more consistent, economical and fairer way to get money to disabled and older people would be through the national insurance and social security systems. This already happens for attendance allowance, disability living allowance and other invalidity benefits. This should be the foundation of the radical reform that is necessary for care and support, putting people who receive state funding and those who are self-funding in the same position of having control over finances. There is, however, danger on the horizon. The Local Government Association is arguing that rights-based national insurance disability benefits should be allocated to local councils and be wrapped up in councils' discretionary, cash-strapped social care budgets. This would be a retrograde step, taking security and rights away from people who need money to get the help they need.</p> <p>Now is the time to put the Poor Law to bed, and to build on Beveridge - not by turning the clock back or by tinkering, but by tailoring a new framework for assisting disabled and older people. </p> <p>\u2022 Ray Jones is professor of social work at Kingston University and St George's, University of London</p>",
  "<p>There was an instant verdict by one blog poster on the Guardian's website when Gordon Brown last week pledged \"ground-breaking legislation to enshrine in the law of the land Labour's pledge to end child poverty\". It said simply: \"And tomorrow he's going to announce a law that the sun will shine all day.\" </p> <p>It's not hard to understand the cynicism. Officials readily concede that there is no agreement on what such a law would say, and still less on how it might be enforced. No one could be against helping needy infants. But hard cash is what families need, not good intentions dressed up as statute. It is sorely tempting to dismiss the scheme as gesture politics.</p> <p>Tempting, but, I suggest, mistaken. Got right, legislation could bring real gains for children. The obvious parallel here is with the climate change bill, which, let's not forget, is currently gliding through parliament with all-party support. Whatever the spin, it will not guarantee that sustainable emissions will be achieved. Legal experts say it is \"unthinkable\" that an English court could force ministers to hit their carbon targets. The highly political calls required - closing power station s, or raising petrol tax - are ones that no judge could ever make. In the same way, whatever the law says about poverty, no court will compel a chancellor to increase child benefit. </p> <p>But in neither case does it follow that enshrining targets in law is pointless. The climate change bill sets up a committee of experts to advise ministers on how targets can be hit. It enforces a transparent reporting framework, strengthening the hand of parliament in holding ministers to account. And while judges might not be able to change policy, they will be able to insist on due regard being paid to the evidence and be able to declare ministers to be in breach of the law. Such rulings can find echo in the one court that politicians must respect - the court of public opinion.</p> <p>A child poverty law could offer similar advantages. The big difference is that the appropriate targets would be politically contentious. Or, at least, they might be. We can't know for sure, because neither government nor opposition has yet pinned down the type of poverty they wish to eradicate. Two years have passed since Tory policy chief Oliver Letwin wrote in the Guardian that \"David Cameron's Conservatives are committed to the government target of ending child poverty by 2020\". The Tories had previously presided over a doubling of its rate, so this appeared to be an audacious act of transformation. In reality, it meant little, for there is no firm target for 2020. Without agreement on what poverty means, the shared rhetorical pledge means little. </p> <p>Legislating provides a chance to test - and flesh out - the supposed consensus. After being early proponents of the climate change bill, the Conservatives cannot credibly claim such legislation is automatically a waste of parliamentary time. They could oppose all hard targets outright, which would expose their warm words as empty. Or instead they could come to an agreement with the government on what poverty means. </p> <p>That would be the better outcome. Labour's commitment for 2010 is to halve the number of youngsters whose families lag behind typical income by more than 40%. Poverty has edged back up in the last two years, but even before then it was obvious that eradication would have to be judged with another yardstick: temporary fluctuations in earnings mean snapshot income measures can never be cut to zero.</p> <p>If agreement were reached on a measure that at least committed Conservatives to preventing the financial gap from widening, then poor children would be protected from any rerun of the 1980s. Cameron says redistribution has \"run out of road\", suggesting he is in no mood to give that undertaking. But to make his compassionate words ring true, he must show he can surprise us.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Tom Clark is the Guardian's social affairs leader writer.</p>",
  "<p>If a week is a long time in politics, then a day is a long time in finance. Business news used to be dry, but that's all changed. Reading the financial headlines now feels like an armchair rollercoaster - not so much green shoots as green faces. <br><br>The Conservative party must have very mixed feelings. Bad news for the economy is worse news for the prime minister; 11 years in Downing Street, 10 of them in the Treasury, means he's squarely in the frame. Not flush, just Gordon. </p> <p>But the headlines \u2013 from the FT's \"<a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/17ce4468-8f22-11dd-946c-0000779fd18c.html?nclick_check=1\">Banking's crisis of confidence deepens</a>\" to the Guardian's \"<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global/2008/oct/01/manufacturing.manufacturingdata\">UK manufacturing sector shrinks at fastest rate in 17 years</a>\" \u2013 have threatened to push their conference off the front pages. </p> <p>And the nature of the crisis has exposed the twin Tory weaknesses: bad experience in the past, and inexperience today. </p> <p>It was, after all, Conservative government deregulation of financial services that opened the era of easy credit and led to first boom, then bust, in the mortgage market, back in the days when David Cameron was Norman Lamont's bag carrier. While commentators turn to the Lib Dems' Treasury spokesman, Vincent Cable, for advice, <a href=\"http://sarabedford.com/blog/2008/09/do-you-know-as-much-about-economics-as-vince-cable-george/\">the shadow chancellor, George Osborne, is left floundering </a>.</p> <p>On Monday night, we were canvassing residents in one of the tower blocks in Finsbury, on Islington's border with the Square Mile. The brightly-lit office blocks of the city looked within touching distance, but could be a million miles away. We were talking about pensions, post offices, mental health care. Bailing out bankers is not these constituents' top priority. </p> <p>The Lib Dem prescription - cutting taxes for people on low and middle incomes, providing more affordable housing, making the energy companies reinvest in tackling fuel poverty, and helping people in debt - strikes far more of a chord on the doorsteps. We think the government should help savers before speculators, hence <a href=\"http://www.libdems.org.uk/home/clegg-government-must-guarantee-all-bank-deposits-to-protect-british-savers-11713303;show \">Nick Clegg's call for depositor protection legislation</a> - but once again the government seems to have got its priorities wrong. </p> <p>Cable was one of the first to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/sep/29/bradfordbingley.creditcrunch\">warn against converting building societies into banks</a>, the demutualisation that junked an essentially prudent tradition for wild speculation (something of a parable for New Labour). In Islington at least, that spirit of mutuality lives on. Our <a href=\"http://www.iccu.coop\">local credit union </a> is now open to all Islington borough residents \u2013 and those in the City too.</p> <p>If a day is a long time in finance, then a decade is a short time in regeneration. Last week I was part of the group unveiling a <a href=\"http://www.waterscape.com/features-and-articles/news/1080/full-public-access-a-step-closer-for-city-road-basin\">new public open space at City Road Basin</a>. Part of the waterside that for generations has been a shabby and inaccessible area behind industrial blocks is now a new piazza, where people can now enjoy the amazing views the length of the basin. This expanse of water is Islington's second largest public open space, now truly open for our community to enjoy. </p> <p>This hasn't happened by accident, but as part of the \"planning gain\" from a new development; a mix of offices, flats and affordable homes, it's been at least six years in the planning. And the local council has secured the open space before much of the <a href=\"http://www.angelwaterside.com/index2.html\">private development</a> which is paying for it has been started - quite an achievement. The award-winning architect <a href=\"http://www.bennettsassociates.com/\">Rab Bennetts </a> told us that other regeneration schemes he's championed have taken a decade or more; so on that basis, City Road Basin is steaming ahead. </p> <p>A bizarre postscript to Ruth Kelly's departure as transport secretary is the Tory U-turn on Heathrow. Labour MPs seem proudest when voting with the Lib Dems \u2013 on issues from nuclear power to 42 days. And now the Conservatives too are <a href=\"http://www.libdems.org.uk/policies/liberal-democrats-approve-radical-transport-reforms-551593;show\">following our lead</a>, rejecting Heathrow expansion in favour of high-speed rail.</p> <p>For years Liberal Democrats have argued that expanding Heathrow is wrong, when fighting climate change must be a priority. An expanded Heathrow will be the equivalent of building another airport the size of Gatwick, producing the same amount of CO2 emissions as Kenya. BAA's plans would see a whole community flattened, with all the arrogance of an 18th lord moving the village to improve his view. And in the current economic climate \u2013 with fuel costs rising, airlines folding and the business market contracting \u2013 it's a bad investment too. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Boris' <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article4794832.ece\">barmy idea</a> of an island airport would be entertaining, were he not the mayor of London.

  "<p>Sociologist <strong><a href=\"http://www.emile-durkheim.com/\">Emile Durkheim</a></strong> defined religion as a \"church\", a collection of people who are all part of a moral community. Anthropologist <strong><a href=\"http://www.americanethnography.com/article_sql.php?id=9\">Edward Burnett Tylor</a></strong> defined religion as \"a belief in the existence of spiritual beings\". Durkheim is saying that religion is largely about institutions, Tylor that religion is mostly about beliefs.</p> <p>Both are right. Religion matters as beliefs and institutions. It is this combination that gives religion its immense power, for good and ill. </p> <p>In our own society religious ideas underpin the workings of our courts, schools and hospitals. Though we see ourselves as living in a post-religious age, notions of right and wrong, our concern with charity and social justice are bound up with our Christian heritage: love thine enemy. </p> <p>Hatred, violence and war are also shaped by religious beliefs and institutions. In European history the Crusades and the Spanish Inquisition demonstrate some of Christianity's darker justifications. In Africa, most rebel movements, such as the <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/katine/lra\">Lord's Resistance Army</a></strong>, almost always claim religious or spiritual guidance <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/katine/2008/feb/19/background\">in their work</a></strong>.</p> <p>Whether religion is a force for good or not, it dominates life in Africa. A walk down any street in any town or trading centre will reveal some sort of place of worship. If people own only one book it will be the Bible or the Qur'an. These two texts are a source of spiritual and moral guidance, a way of making sense of the world.</p> <p>It is all too easy to view religion in Africa as something static and unchanging, bound up with ideas of what is \"tradition\" or culture. Christianity, in particular, suffers in this regard. It is viewed by many outsiders with suspicion, a thing that is inauthentic, un-African. The truth is very far from this. The clergy is almost entirely made up of Africans and has been for most of the past century. Few of the people I know in Teso would regard Christianity as a \"European\" religion.</p> <p>Instead many of my friends point out to me that it now falls to Africans to do missionary work in Europe. The average Anglican is a 24-year-old African woman.</p> <p>For many of those young women religion has been central to the way they cope with difficult times. </p> <p>Religious ideas offer a way of making sense of devastation and loss. In Katine, the strong belief that we should prepare for the life to come makes sense in a place where the future is rarely guaranteed. When it seems that almost everything else has gone out of life there is prayer. As <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/katine/2008/sep/22/villagevoices.news\">Janet Anyango</a></strong> said last month: \"I knew that he [her son] was gone. For me I just continued praying. I asked God to receive his soul.\"</p> <p>Maybe people like Janet are just \"clinging to religion\". That religion is all they have left. </p> <p>In learning about life in Katine we are beginning to realise that people's spiritual life is connected to how they think about development. While the strength of religious feeling is something that makes many outsiders uneasy, if we do not take it seriously then we are not serious about understanding social, economic and political change. </p> <p>Many people working for development agencies or writing in the media about Africa choose to ignore this side of life on the continent (how much coverage of Christianity or Islam do you see when Robbie Williams or Victoria Wood descend on a community in aid of Comic Relief?). But this makes for a slightly unreal representation of life on the continent, one that many people living in Africa would struggle to recognise.</p> <p>The Guardian is a bit uncomfortable about reporting religion. In one of the <strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/katineblog/2007/oct/18/welcome\">postings on the Katine Chronicles blog</a></strong> at the start of the project, Greenshoots points out that something is missing from the Guardian's coverage:</p> <p>\"I am slightly puzzled by the fact there does not, judging by your articles, to be any church in Katine. . . . .I know from my own experience how important a church is in the life of most African communities. Has it closed down or something?\"</p> <p>Of course the church has not closed down. The absence of churches in early coverage was part of the narrow view of life in Katine that is only now beginning to change. The African Medical and Research Foundation's (Amref) own work has also been at some distance from churches in Katine, something that might limit the effectiveness of their work in the longer term.</p> <p>Religion is at the heart of life in Katine. Anyone who visits the sub-county on a Sunday and goes along to mass in the Catholic church or a healing ceremony in a Pentecostal church understands this immediately. </p> <p>It is also there in the background of most of the stories we read and hear about, and in the way people in Katine talk about and think about development. </p> <p>Life is viewed in a holistic way. Development work is not only about material improvements, such as a new school, or a borehole, but the spiritual changes that come through education and a good health.</p> <p>If we are to make sense of life in Katine then we have to understand that religious beliefs and institutions are a driving force - for good or ill.</p>",
  "<p>With <a href=\"http://www.esquire.com/features/75-most-influential/steve-jobs-1008\">Steve Jobs and the Portal to the Invisible</a>, Esquire magazine has given Apple's boss what almost amounts to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2008/aug/28/stevejobstheobituary\">another obituary</a>, with the implication that he's going to die sooner rather than later. It says:</p> <blockquote> <p>It is true that his cancer, originating not in the ductwork of the pancreas but rather in the islets of Langerhans, is slow growing and, in the words of one expert, can be addressed \"with curative intent\"; it is also true that even after surgery, the average patient lives about five years. </p> </blockquote> <p>But the 6,700-word story doesn't show too much respect for the living, dishing the dirt on what some people really think of him. It says:<br></p> <blockquote> <p>Nobody wants to be the guy who points out that Jobs is \"an obnoxious asshole\" or \"just a horrifying human being\" -- because then Jobs has already won, simply on the basis of scale. Better to be the ex-Apple-employee who says, \"The question is not whether he's an asshole. That's beside the point. The question is whether he can be an asshole and a good Buddhist.\" <br>\"For most people, he'll go down in history as the guy who made technology user-friendly,\" says one executive. \"But to people in business, he'll be remembered as the guy who only did deals where he had all the leverage -- and used every bit of it. It's not enough that he wins. You have to lose. He's completely unreasonable.\" </p> </blockquote> <p>Author Tom Junod makes rather a lot of the fact that Jobs was adopted and apparently needs to prove himself: \"he has, shall we say, control issues that many adoptive parents would recognize.\" </p> <p>He also makes quite a lot of Jobs's desire for some sort of immortality, while pointing out that today's iPod is tomorrow's landfill, just like the old Sony Walkman.</p> <p>Raised but not answered (not surprisingly) is what happens to Apple after Steve Jobs dies. As a company, Apple is now more of a one-man show than ever before. He is irreplaceable, and if he hadn't returned to the company, it seems unlikely that Apple would have survived. How long it would survive his death is a key question.</p>",
  "<p>Michael Bloomberg is expected tomorrow to announce he will seek a third term as mayor of New York, challenging the city's term-limits law during a financial crisis that threatens to damage its economy.</p> <p>In running for re-election, he would be reversing course after years of supporting mayoral term limits.</p> <p>The 66-year-old mayor could help bail out beleaguered Wall Street with a personal cheque \u2013 he has a net worth estimated at $20bn and has waived a salary from the city. He was once a partner at now-defunct Salomon Brothers investment bank and his company's financial terminals grace virtually every trading floor on Wall Street.</p> <p>Bloomberg, who commands significant influence with national Republicans and Democrats, would also be courting a public backlash if he follows through with the term-limits reversal, which the New York Times reported today.</p> <p>Limits on mayoral service remain popular in New York, where the electorate could protest if Bloomberg asks the city council, rather than voters, to overturn the 15-year-old term limits law.</p> <p>Bloomberg's predecessor, Rudy Giuliani, pushed unsuccessfully to run for a third term in 2001 following the World Trade Center terrorist attack.

  "<p>I couldn't pass up the opportunity to stop by my local Starbucks in North Carolina last Saturday to get a tall brew and chat with the group of Obama supporters who use it as their headquarters for weekly neighbourhood canvassing operations.</p> <p>There was a certain sense of foreboding in the air. Rumours of <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2008/09/29/news/companies/wachovia_citigroup/index.htm?postversion=2008092908\">Citibank's takeover of Charlotte-headquartered Wachovia</a> were already rampant, and whenever your home state's flagship bank gets bought up at firesale prices, you just know that <a href=\"http://charlotte.bizjournals.com/charlotte/stories/2008/09/29/daily21.html\">layoffs are imminent</a>, and it makes folks nervous. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/wallstreet\">financial debates in Washington</a> had taken on new and suddenly very personal aspect. This wasn't mere politics any more. This was about survival.</p> <p>There were at least seven or eight volunteers congregating outside in the cool autumn morning, and as one pair would leave, canvassing packets in hand, a few more would show up ready to get to work. It was an excellent place to hear these Obamanauts wax rhapsodic about their candidate.</p> <p>For an allegedly fanatical band of supporters blindly following a charismatic leader, they were strangely critical of Obama's performance in Friday's <a href=\"http://news.google.co.uk/news/url?sa=t&amp;ct=us:g/3-0&amp;fp=48e2a9ea7c54e7ae&amp;ei=kl_iSPi3JaSwQ5fc9PoG&amp;url=http%3A//www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/27/uselections2008.barackobama&amp;cid=1252657626&amp;usg=AFQjCNHRMCzjysjTx0o6-F3qmt9GNtflPQ\">presidential debate</a>. Indeed, over the course of an hour, every single one had virtually pages of criticism about the debate. Obama talked too much about taxes. He didn't talk enough about taxes. He spent too much time on the war and the surge. He didn't hit the war hard enough. He didn't go after McCain enough. He was too sharp on McCain. He showed far too much deference to his opponent. He was far too insolent to his opponent. His answers sounded too polished and practiced. His answers weren't flowing naturally and freely - why didn't he practice more? The consensus was clearly that Obama did OK, but he should have done better \u2013 with each of his supposedly obsessive supporters knowing exactly what he should have said. </p> <p>The impressive thing about the Obama people was their dedication. They were not so much blinded by hope and audacity as they were cynically recalling the last few tainted presidential elections and vowing never again to suffer through something similar. After that, it was \"fill in the blanks\".</p> <p>Each had a particular hot-button issue: immigration, universal healthcare, a return to justice and the rule of law, governmental competence, the wars, the deficit, the defence of science or just an intense desire for revenge on the Bush administration. The Obamanauts were all well versed in policy and ready to make impassioned arguments to any who would listen. Far from being enamoured of their candidate, they were all convinced that Obama wasn't doing nearly enough with policy on X, and if he really wanted to win all he had to do was Y.</p> <p>Few other cultures can project the sense of righteous indignation that an American \"armchair quarterback\" can when it comes to national politics. Despite having obviously planned this for years, built a dynamic and amazingly stable political organisation, pioneering new and innovative strategies and tactics, deftly handled the gruelling two-year-long primary process, and successfully raising record amounts of campaign contributions without overtly selling out to any industry or special interest group, Obama wasn't quite on point for these folks. Even the most stalwart Obama supporter was certain that they, and they alone, knew the secret to convincing a jaded electorate that Obama was the best choice for president. </p> <p>All the volunteers but one, I should say. Just as I was leaving, one of my original <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/feb/03/theobamadads\">Obama Dads</a> arrived. He's an African-American guy just a few years younger than me, but he had a haggard expression as he stumbled toward the promise of coffee and an afternoon of pounding the pavement for Obama. We'd lost touch over the last few months as our other commitments kept us out of active campaigning \u2013 kids will do that to you. But after swapping new Wachovia rumours, I was surprised that he had no complaints about the debate, no blanks that needed to be filled in order to make it the perfect campaign. </p> <p>\"He's kicking butt, and everyone needs to just back off,\" he suggested. \"He knows what he's doing. These guys are just so scared of losing that they don't remember what winning feels like, that's all. Look at McCain at the debate. Remember he's 72 years old. Remember who his running mate is. I'm not worried.\" </p> <p>That raises the question of why he was out here. Offhandedly I mentioned how tired he looked, and he revealed with a weary grin that his wife had given birth to a new baby girl a week ago. </p> <p>I was shocked. A week-old newborn, and one kid already destroying the house, and he was spending valuable sleeping time on a pretty Saturday volunteering to talk to occasionally grumpy strangers in a predominantly white neighbourhood about the election. I was mystified, and said as much.</p> <p>He didn't hesitate to show me a picture of the new kid on his phone \u2013 a pretty baby, for the record, as far as newborns go. And she had beautiful big brown eyes that were copied straight from her mama. How could he leave an adorable face like that for this? \"It's because I have a week-old baby girl that I'm volunteering,\" he explained earnestly. \"There's too much at stake to depend on other folks to do it. She's my responsibility, so this is my job.\" His voice was strong, if weary, and utterly resolute. Just the kind of thing you want in a volunteer.</p>",

  "<p>Austrian voters <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/29/austria.thefarright\">showed their dissatisfaction</a> with the work of the two main parties of the Social Democrats and the People's party by deserting them in large numbers in this week's general election. The result, which is the worst in history for the two main parties, means that there are no large dominating parties on the Austrian political landscape anymore, just many middle-sized parties. </p> <p>The Social Democrats, despite their poorest ever performance, were hailing a victory because they still emerged as the single largest party. The party had been suffering in opinion polls, but a last-minute switch in leadership and late delivery of key election promises in the final parliamentary vote before the new election enabled Social Democrats to recoup some votes \u2013 mainly at the expense of the Conservatives. </p> <p>Despite the late gains, though, the reality is that the election did not work out for them as well as they had hoped. The big winners remain the rightwing parties. Some in Austria say it's the revival of the right; others that it was just a protest vote. The truth probably lies somewhere between. </p> <p>What is certain is that the bulk of the resurgent right's supporters were from the working class and middle class \u2013 and that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/30/austria\">Freedom party</a>, in particular, was the most popular among young Austrians. Leftwing parties failed to motivate people to vote for them. The failure of the Liberal Forum, especially, was a big disappointment. But, given that the party's figurehead was a former Freedom party candidate for president who has moved to the left, and that their one and only MP had made a name for himself as an opponent of buying Eurofighter jets at the same time as owning a firm that lobbied for support for the deal, did not help their chances. This election, then, probably marks the death of the Liberal movement in Austria. </p> <p>Before the vote, the Freedom party categorically ruled out any alliance with the BZ\u00d6 of J\u00f6rg Haider, who, in contrast, always said he would not rule out any cooperation \u2013 not even with the Greens. Like the FP\u00d6, the Social Democrats always said they would never form an alliance with Haider, whom they blame for previous election disasters. But before the election, nobody thought that Haider would overtake the Greens. He was a spent force \u2013 a powerful provincial governor but not a national force \u2013 but then the Greens finished fifth. </p> <p>Even a deal with Haider is not without complications. however. He always said he would only come back in a significant role such as vice chancellor. The vote for his party shows the personal appeal he has in the country \u2013 and he made much of his record in Carinthia, with populist policies such as discount petrol stations and tax subsidies for families. Haider was also a clear winner in televised debates, adopting a more moderate mode in his delivery compared with the firebrand political rhetoric he used to use when with the Freedom party. </p> <p>But the most likely possibility for Austria, if the current Conservative leader, Wilhelm Molterer, is forced to step down, is a deal once again between the Conservatives and the Social Democrats. This is a strong likelihood given the weakness of the latter's position. </p> <p>Both former coalition partners admit the massive electoral switch to the right is a clear wake-up call, and if they do get back together, they will need to work without any of the bitter infighting that characterised the last government. Any new alliance will need to push through some much-needed reforms and legislation to meet their election promises. Such a new government would have a smaller but still comfortable majority in Parliament. Most analysts agree that if the two main parties succeed in cooperation and deliver results, there is a chance it will work out \u2013 and the far right's advances be brought to a halt.</p>",
  "<p>So Mike Bloomberg apparently wants a third term as mayor of New York. The city's voters supported a term-limits referendum 15 years ago, limiting mayors to two terms. Bloomberg's plan to overturn that decision, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/01/nyregion/01bloomberg.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin\">according to the NYT</a>, would sidestep the voters and apparently leave it up to the City Council. </p> <p>And lo and behold the City Council just might support a revocation because:</p> <blockquote> <p>The chances of passing legislation in the City Council are strong, according to interviews. In August, a New York Times survey of council members \u2014 two-thirds of whom are scheduled to be forced out of office in 2009 \u2014 found that a majority were willing to amend the term limits law.</p> </blockquote> <p>Well, I used to cover the Naked City. In a previous life I'd have had a lot to say about this. Now, my chief interest in the matter is that it pretty much guarantees that whatever chance there was that Bloomberg might have endorsed John McCain -- McCain has courted the mayor, a Jewish independent, and Bloomberg has more of a personal relationship with McCain than he does with Obama -- just went from whatever it was to zero.</p> <p>Why do I say this? Because New York City voter enrollment is five-to-one Democratic, and Obama is going to carry the five boroughs with somewhere between 75% and 85% of the vote. Nobody who just decided he's going to try to go before two million or so heavily Democratic and substantially black voters is going to endorse a man who's going to win 15% of their vote (the rest will go to Ralph Nader).</p> <p>So the question is raised: might Bloomberg endorse Obama? If he'd decided to run for governor, I'd have said there was no percentage in it. But a Bloomberg who's running for mayor , and trying to fend off about three Democratic challengers including one who is African-American (the city comptroller), just might make a different calculus. </p> <p>It would certainly be a useful endorsement from Obama's point of view, not for New York of course (which is sewn up) but for Jewish voters in Florida and elsewhere.<br></p>",
  "<p>The Republican Sarah Palin and her officials in the Alaskan state government drew on the work of at least six scientists known to be sceptical about the dangers and causes of global warming, to back efforts to stop polar bears being protected as an endangered species, the Guardian can disclose. Some of the scientists were funded by the oil industry. </p> <p>In official submissions to the US government's consultation on the status of the polar bear, Palin and her team referred to at least six scientists who have questioned either the existence of warming as a largely man-made phenomenon or its severity. One paper was partly funded by the US oil company ExxonMobil.</p> <p>The status of the polar bear has become a battleground in the debate on global warming. In May the US department of the interior rejected Palin's objections and listed the bear as a threatened species, saying that two-thirds of the world's polar bears were likely to be extinct by 2050 due to the rapid melting of the sea ice. Palin, governor of Alaska and the Republican nominee for US vice-president, responded last month by suing the federal government, to try to overturn the ruling. The case will be heard in January.</p> <p>Though the state of Alaska has no polar bear specialists on its staff, the governor's stance has pitted it against the combined scientific fire-power of the US Fish and Wildlife Service, the US Geological Survey, and world experts on the mammal.</p> <p>In its lawsuit, Alaska said it opposed the endangered label partly because the listing would \"deter activities such as \u2026 oil and gas exploration and development\". Oil companies recently bid $2.7bn (\u00a31.5bn) for rights to explore the Chuckchi sea, an established polar bear habitat.</p> <p>The threatened species status might also impede the building of an Alaskan natural gas pipeline, which Palin has called the \"will of God\". In a letter last year to the US interior secretary, Dirk Kempthorne, she said she believed the polar bear population was \"abundant, stable and unthreatened by direct human activity\". She opposed the call for the listing because it \"did not use the best available scientific and commercial information\".</p> <p>Her own Alaskan review of the science drew on a joint paper by seven authors, four of whom were well-known climate- change contrarians. Her paper argued that it was \"certainly premature, if not impossible\" to link temperature rise in Alaska with human CO2 emissions.</p> <p>The paper, entitled Polar Bears of Western Hudson Bay and Climate Change, has been criticised for relying on old research and ignoring evidence that Arctic sea-ice is melting at a quickening pace. Walt Meier, a world authority on sea ice, based at the National Snow and Ice Data Centre, said: \"The paper doesn't measure up scientifically.\"</p> <p>One co-author of the paper, Willie Soon, completed the study with funding from ExxonMobil \u2014 which has oil operations in Alaska's North Slope \u2014 as well as from the American Petroleum Institute. Soon was a former senior scientist with the George C Marshall Institute, which acts as an incubator for climate-change scepticism. The institute has received $715,000 in funding from ExxonMobil since 1998. </p> <p>In May, ExxonMobil announced that it was no longer funding Marshall and other groups linked with contrarian views. It said this was to avoid \"distraction from the need to provide energy while reducing greenhouse gas emissions\" and stressed that the company did not \"control the research itself\".</p> <p>Another co-author of the document was Sallie Baliunas. In 2003 she and Soon were criticised when it was revealed that a joint paper had been partially funded by the American Petroleum Institute. Thirteen scientists whom they cited issued a rebuttal and several editors of the journal Climate Research resigned because of the \"flawed peer review\". A third co-author of the polar bear study, David Legates, a professor at Delaware University, is also associated with the Marshall Institute.</p> <p>The citation by Palin and her officials prompted complaints from Congress. One member, Brad Miller, dubbed the polar bear study phony science. <br>Palin told Miller: \"Attempts to discredit scientists...simply because their analyses do not agree with your views, would be a disservice to this country.\" Miller now says that Palin's use of the paper shows she differs greatly from John McCain, the Republican presidential contender, who has pressed for scientific integrity. \"Turning to the cottage industry of scientists who are funded because they spread doubt about global warming is not integrity,\" Miller said.</p> <p>Palin's submission consulted J Scott Armstrong, a specialist in forecasting, who regards the global warming issue as \"public hysteria\". </p> <p>Two other contrarian scholars were cited. One was Syun-Ichi Akasofu, formerly director of the International Arctic Research Centre, in Alaska, who argues that climate change could be a hangover from the -little ice age. He is a founding director of the Heartland Institute, a thinktank that has received $676,500 from ExxonMobil since 1998. </p> <p>Timothy Ball, a retired professor from Winnipeg, is cited for his climate and polar bear research. He has called human-made global warming \"the greatest deception in the history of science\". He has worked with both Friends of Science, and the Natural Resources Stewardship Project, which each had funding from energy firms. </p> <p>Kert Davies, research director at Greenpeace US, said the state of Alaska under Palin's leadership had relied on scholars who argue the opposite view to that of the overwhelming consensus in the scientific community. \"It shows that she is completely out of touch with the urgency of the climate crisis.\"<br>Last month Palin agreed that the Alaskan climate was changing but added: \"I'm not one though who would attribute it to being man-made.\" She later tried to retract the statement.</p>",
  "<p>I spent the first part of this morning up in the Birmingham Convention Centre's cheap seats, among a crowd that the Conservatives' stage-managers are perhaps trying to obscure from view: long-standing party activists, at conference for the umpteenth time, and this year understandably excited by the prospect of power. They were there to watch Iain Duncan Smith's presentation on what we must now call social justice. It was a mixture of Powerpoint and crusading zeal, focused on somehow saving \"the next generation\" of socially excluded youth, which climaxed with a pretty fascinating spectacle: IDS pleading with his audience to avoid the hang-'em-and-flog-'em imperatives of yesteryear, and do their best to ensure that politicians did the same. No matter that these were the same people who, back in the 1980s and 1990s, habitually applauded the very opposite message. They cheered him to the rafters.</p> <p>The trouble is, just as you sense the darkening economic backdrop squashing what remains of the Tories' green credentials, so the prospect of a chronic downturn hovers menacingly over their current habit of emphasising the plight of the poor. Yes, the concept of the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6281350.stm\">broken society</a> is still in the foreground, and plenty of Tory mood music \u2013 as with this year's <a href=\"http://www.birminghammail.net/2008/09/29/david-cameron-on-the-conservative-party-conference-97319-21922535/\">\"social action\"</a> exercise, focused on a Birmingham housing estate \u2013 skilfully points it up, but much more seismic political shifts are happening, and they're already nudging Conservative attentions somewhere rather different.</p> <p>Now we're past the phase dedicated to the decontamination of the Tory brand, Conservatism feels much less non-U than it did recently. It's OK to talk about tax cuts, as evidenced by George Osborne's plans on council tax, that totemic move on the raising of the inheritance tax threshold, and all that fuzzy talk about a general \"aspiration\" to drop income tax. Partially characterising the perils of the economy as a matter of out-of-control public borrowing gets the Conservatives back to kitchen table economics, and a new emphasis on parsimony. The plight of the motorist has returned to their thoughts. When the Guardian asked Conservatives to vote for their favourite ever Tory, it was perhaps telling that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/30/conservatives.labour\">winner was Margaret Thatcher</a>. Exactly where the IDS agenda fits into all this is a very interesting question.</p> <p>A very telling lesson in all this arrived on conference's first afternoon, when Osborne hosted a session about the economy: a pretty strange attempt at a political version of daytime TV, in which shadow ministers, Tory activists and supposed average folks talked about how the current economic woes were impacting on their lives. As far as I could tell, three out of four of the regular Joes were small businesspeople, understandably rattled by collapsing banks and shrinking order books. That their anxieties were real was not really the issue: what spoke volumes was that their number didn't include anyone who was low-paid, or on benefits, or in social housing. As far I could tell, these were probably not people whose hearts would flutter at talk of new schemes for the people of Toxteth, Brixton or Handsworth. Crudely put, they wanted government to back off, cut their taxes, and drop the price of petrol.</p> <p>The upshot of all this? Though the political game suddenly feels a little more finely balanced than it did a couple of weeks ago, imagine this: Cameron in Downing Street, and the economy faltering yet further. Whereupon the core vote would cry out, the activists up in the gods would do likewise, and all that stuff about poverty would pass into irrelevance, as the Tories relentlessly focused on a very Middle English complaint: where's my chunk of the rock?</p>",
  "<p>As the Russian forces invaded Georgia, the <a href=\"http://www.osce.org/\">Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)</a> found itself fighting for relevance and influence. Russia recently stopped the organisation from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/23/georgia.russia\">sending unarmed observers</a> to the breakaway republic of South Ossetia. This is bad news for the OSCE, which is trying to carve more than a niche role for itself.</p> <p>The OSCE emerged out of the <a href=\"http://www.csce.gov/\">CSCE</a>, which was the security and cooperation dialogue launched in 1974 in Helsinki \u2013 the Helsinki Process and the Helsinki Final Act \u2013 between the Soviets and the west. It stretches from Vancouver to Vladivostok comprising 53 member states and a handful of observer states. It operates a number of missions on the ground in the Balkans, East Europe, South Caucasus, and Central Asia.</p> <p>Russia and many of the CIS states <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/feb/08/russia.eu\">criticise the organisation routinely</a> for over-focusing on the human dimension. They describe the election monitors, and OSCE's human rights and media work as western ploys aimed at regime change. They fear that revolutions, such as what happened in Ukraine and Georgia, will soon arrive at their doorstep. Still, these countries all face serious security challenges, from porous borders, to problems with organised crime, corruption, institutional weakness and economic underdevelopment, which is why they are reluctant to simply walk out of the OSCE. The OSCE is also the only security organisation where Central Asia and Caucasus states sit behind the same table as western powers, and have an equal say in the process.</p> <p>On the other side are the US and some of its allies who would rather not invest in strengthening the organisation, but use it as a toolbox for dealing with problems no one else wants or is able to tackle. Washington wants the OSCE in Afghanistan. This is wrong. The internal processes of this massive security organisation are too cumbersome for an environment that is highly volatile and where decisions have to be made quickly. It is being set up to fail, and when it does, the sceptics will have yet another reason to pull the plug.</p> <p>The safer bet is to re-energise the organisation by increasing its stake in security, stability and economic progress in the broader Caucasus-Caspian region. The OSCE has ample experience in this area, a number of on-the-ground missions setup and running, and a reason to be here. There is a fair degree of success in terms of projects completed by the OSCE in the Caucasus-Caspian region already.</p> <p>The key is in finding a partner country that can lift the organisation's profile in the Caucasus-Caspian region. This cannot be a western state, or Russia. But Kazakhstan can do it when it takes over the OSCE chairmanship in 2010.</p> <p>This flamboyant central Asian republic, biggest in terms of territory in the group of stans and rich with energy, Kazakhstan has always had an interest in greater regional development and stability, and kept up its good relations with all neighbours, particularly with Russia and China, and its strategic long-distance partner the US. Kazakhstan already played a major role in stabilising the situation in <a href=\"http://www.rferl.org/section/Kyrgyzstan/159.html\">Kyrgyzstan</a> in 2005 when fighting broke out there, and Astana has extended a helping hand to Tajikistan and others. It is working closely now with Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan on trans-Caspian energy projects, and with Uzbekistan on the development and export of raw materials. So far, Kazakhstan has been vocal on the regional economic platform, but Astana can initiate a regional security and cooperation dialogue as well.</p> <p>Following the conflict in Georgia, both Azerbaijan and Armenia are under pressure, which raises the risk of violence over <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/country_profiles/3658938.stm\">Nagorno-Karabakh</a>. The territory, occupied by Armenian forces, is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/03/turkey.armenia\">disputed</a>. The Armenians claim it is needed as a buffer. This is an unsustainable reality, and it contradicts all principles and norms of international law.</p> <p>Turkey tried to defuse the tension by reaching out to Armenia and suggesting to Baku that Ankara be the new chaperone of the peace process. This is a good move, which Baku and Yerevan could come to embrace. Kazakhstan can add its weight behind this process too, by offering its direct and active support as the incoming leader of the OSCE. It would be smart for the Kazakhs to appoint a special representative of their government responsible for the Nagorno-Karabakh frozen conflict. If this conflict is resolved, the biggest obstacle to regional cooperation in the South Caucasus will be removed, which will profoundly change Central Asia's relations with Europe. The two will grow closer. For Kazakhstan this opportunity should be a matter of strategic priority.</p> <p>If Kazakhstan succeeds in reviving the OSCE's regional role this will quiet the sceptics. Also, by convincing Russia and the CIS that OSCE is not about regime change but about regional cooperation, security and economic development, Kazakhstan will silence the critics. It is therefore not an overstatement to suggest that the future of the OSCE is now in the hands of Kazakhstan.</p>",
  "<p>I swear that Howard Kohr, the executive director of Aipac, must have been briefing John McCain for the <a href=\"http://elections.nytimes.com/2008/president/debates/transcripts/first-presidential-debate.html\">presidential debate</a> against Barack Obama last week. The pro-Israel lobbying group has been shreying for years about the \"existential threat\" posed to Israel by Iran. And so McCain seemed to be reading from the Aipac script when he warned:</p> <blockquote> <p>If Iran acquires nuclear weapons, it is an existential threat to the state of Israel and to other countries in the region because the other countries in the region will feel [a] compelling requirement to acquire nuclear weapons as well. Now we cannot [allow] a second Holocaust. Let's just make that very clear.</p> </blockquote> <p>\"Existential threat to the state of Israel\"? Check. \"Second Holocaust\"? Double check. He's following those talking points right down the line. Good boy, John. They'll be some cheques in the mail come Monday.</p> <p>The only problem with this little nugget of wisdom is that one Middle East state already has nuclear weapons. Israel's nuclear weapons cache has motivated other nations in the region like Iraq under Saddam, Iran and perhaps even Syria to feel the compulsion to have them. So if Iran acquired such weapons it wouldn't be as if it were the first state to have them. But for some strange reason neocons like McCain view Israel's nuclear weapons as benign, while an Arab nuclear weapon would be a threat.</p> <p>Here's another talking point covered:</p> <blockquote> <p>Senator Obama ... said ... he would sit down with Ahmadinejad, Chavez and Raul Castro without precondition. Without precondition. Here is Ahmadinejad, who is now in New York, talking about the extermination of the state of Israel, of wiping Israel off the map, and we're going to sit down, without precondition, across the table, to legitimise and give a propaganda platform to a person that is espousing the extermination of the state of Israel, and therefore then giving them more credence in the world arena.</p> </blockquote> <p>\"Wiping Israel off the face of the map\"? Triple check.</p> <p>Problem is, Ahmadinejad didn't talk about exterminating Israel in New York or anywhere else. Does the Iranian president hate Israel? No doubt. Is the feeling mutual among Israeli leaders? You bet. In an <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/30/world/middleeast/30olmert.html?ref=world\">astonishing interview</a> published Monday, Ehud Olmert, the former Israeli prime minister, had this to say about Israel's failed policy toward that country: \"Part of our megalomania and our loss of proportions is the things that are said here about Iran.\"</p> <p>Has Ahmadinejad ever said Iran would attack Israel? No. Can we say the same about Israel? No.</p> <p>In fact, the Guardian's Jonathan Steele published an exclusive story last week revealing that Olmert asked George Bush last May, during Israel's 60th anniversary celebrations, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/25/iran.israelandthepalestinians1\">for approval to bomb Iran</a>. Bush demurred. But had he not, Israel might already have attacked Iran. So the idea that Iran is a mortal threat to Israel, while the latter is an innocent lamb doesn't stand the test of reasonableness.</p> <p>Steele's story makes the presidential choice even starker for those Americans who do not wish to see a military attack against Iran by either the US or Israel. It would appear from McCain's rhetoric that he would approve such an attack were he to become president. As if we needed any more reasons to vote the other way.</p> <p>Another ironic element to all this is that no less a Republican eminence gris than <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/09/27/aps-debate-factcheck-kiss_n_129820.html\">Henry Kissinger has advocated unconditional talks with Iran</a> \"at the highest level\". Isn't it amazing to have Kissinger and Obama agreeing on something?</p> <p>McCain of course tried to claim that <a href=\"http://features.csmonitor.com/politics/2008/09/28/the-debates-kissinger-flap-who-was-right/\">because he'd known Kissinger for 35 years</a>, the old man could have said no such thing. But that's precisely what the former secretary of state did say only last week. Even odder was <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/27/AR2008092700301.html\">Kissinger's statement following the debate</a> that said McCain had it right. It's as if these two old geezers can't remember what they said just yesterday.</p> <p>I think it's a shame that McCain is clearly campaigning for the votes of elderly Florida Jews through pandering to their worst fears about an impending Holocaust. He knows Jews of a certain age will respond like Pavlov's dog if they hear such language used in a context that invokes questions of Jewish survival. I don't blame Jews for having this reaction. A people who has suffered the traumas that ours has is bound to have similar reactions.</p> <p>But I do blame otherwise intelligent politicians who deliberately stoke the fears of such people in pandering for votes in the provinces. Provoking fears of Israel's destruction should have no place in US politics. We need to hold out hope for a brighter future for ourselves and for the state of Israel - a future of negotiation, peace and security.</p>",
  "<p>The pivotal deal brokered by the government for Lloyds TSB to rescue beleaguered mortgage bank HBOS is in jeopardy tonight after a plunge in the value of HBOS shares. City investors fear that Lloyds is paying too much for the Scottish-based bank because its shares have collapsed since the deal was announced two weeks ago.</p> <p>Today HBOS, owner of the country's biggest mortgage lender Halifax, was again the biggest faller in the FTSE 100 of leading shares, dropping 13%.

The shareholders will eventually have to make a decision in a few days time about what is right for them, but I am confident from the leading parties that not only they want this to go ahead, but they are determined to do all the work to make this possible,\" Brown said.</p> <p>Despite the intervention by the prime minister, Lloyds TSB shareholders are concerned that the bank is taking on too much risk in buying HBOS which is dogged by concerns about its ability to find enough funds on the paralysed money markets to keep operating. There are fears that Lloyds will be weakened by the takeover.</p> <p>Robert Talbut, chief investment officer of Royal London Asset Management, said: \"There is a growing feeling that Lloyds could have struck a better deal and that there is pressure for the terms to be reassessed\".</p> <p>The deal is in shares rather than cash. </p> <p>The offer price fluctuates each day with the Lloyds TSB share price. The takeover - which will allow a combination of Lloyds TSB and HBOS to dominate the high street in breach of all the competition rules - is controversial for big City investors. Most of them own shares in HBOS and Lloyds. But those who own more Lloyds shares feel Lloyds is over-paying, while those who own more HBOS shares fear that HBOS has caved in for too low a price despite the precipitous collapse in its share price.</p> <p>A major investor confirmed tonight that the deal was \"not secure\".</p> <p>\"The market is suggesting that the deal is not going to happen. And the market is usually right,\" the investor said.</p> <p>The City is mesmerised by the difference between the HBOS share price and the value of the Lloyds TSB offer. Tonight it stood at a discount of 35% with HBOS shares at 122.4p which is below the 188p value placed on the shares by the Lloyds TSB offer. In normal circumstances, the HBOS share price might be expected to trade closer to the offer price.</p> <p>Under the terms of the transaction, each HBOS share is worth 0.833 of Lloyds shares. But City sources now believe the terms should be scaled back to 0.6 Lloyds shares.</p> <p>Donald Tosh of private client stockbroker Spiers &amp; Jeffrey said: \"The message from the discount is that there is a problem with the deal. Around the world every bust bank has been bailed out by the respective governments. But in the UK, Lloyds is bailing out HBOS and that's why the huge discount has emerged.\"</p> <p>Tonight Lloyds insisted the deal was on track. Chief executive Eric Daniels said: \"Market conditions are obviously difficult. But the acquisition of HBOS remains a fantastic opportunity to create the UK's leading financial services and to create great value for both sets of shareholders\".</p> <p>A spokesman added: \"We are working diligently towards completing the transaction and a huge amount of work is going on behind the scenes\"<br>While City sources believe it is implausible that the takeover will fall apart given the role the government has played in brokering the marriage by allowing the competition rule book to be rewritten, they are acknowledging the share price movements indicate that the market has concerns.</p> <p>The support of shareholders in both banks is crucial. Under the structure of the transaction, Lloyds needs 50% support from its shareholders to complete the deal, while HBOS requires 75% of its shareholders to support the deal. </p> <p>The government told Lloyds it would ensure the deal was cleared by the competition authorities, while Lloyds promised to ensure it would keep the mortgage market afloat, particularly by offering loans to first-time buyers.</p>",
  "<p>Electoral reform is a difficult sell at the Conservative party conference; promoting it sometimes seems like trying to sell Chelsea tractors at the Greens' annual gathering. But there are some stirrings, and some new arguments about the constitution and elections are being heard at Birmingham. Tories who support proportional representation have in the past tended to be liberal in their general approach, but reform is finding some adherents among hard-edged right wingers such as Douglas Carswell, MP for Harwich since 2005 and one of the more interesting thinkers within the Tory party \u2013 one of the few MPs who can refer to Weber and Gramsci and sound as if he knows what he is talking about.</p> <p>Representation in parliament is one of the last monopoly public services left. Carswell asked at an <a href=\"http://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/\">Electoral Reform Society</a> fringe meeting in Birmingham why it was that in a world where people are used to shopping around, telephones and electricity had been made competitive, there was still a single supplier of representative services that you had to like or lump. In an environment where consumer choice is the dominant force, and people increasingly look at politics as consumers, why not have multi-member constituencies? Competition and choice improve standards. Lazy MPs, or those who did not represent the views of their constituents properly, would face internal competition, and there would be fewer barriers to new talent and new ideas coming forward. While Carswell is vague on which electoral system he favours with his multi-member seats, his vision is perfectly compatible with the long-term electoral reform goal of the <a href=\"http://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/votingsystems/systems3.htm\">Single Transferable Vote</a> (STV). It is also part of Conservative history \u2013 after all, Disraeli introduced the three-member boroughs and the \"limited vote\" in 1867.</p> <p>Carswell is very much a maverick Conservative, and he was joined on the ERS panel by more familiar Tory voices. Eleanor Laing represented the pleasant, moderate face of Tory partisanship and constitutional immobilism, and Bruce Anderson adopted his familiar role as the voice of candid reaction who frankly acknowledged the benefits of elective dictatorship \u2013 as long as it was the Conservative party doing the dictating. </p> <p>I doubt that many opponents of the Conservatives would be unduly worried by the arguments of Laing or Anderson, but Carswell's case would be unsettling. He uses reforming language to <a href=\"http://stores.lulu.com/renewbritain\">argue</a> for quite radical Conservative projects \u2013 a more securely founded Conservative government would have the hegemony necessary to deal with the alleged progressive bias of the broadcast media, the civil service and the education system. Carswell also favours direct democracy and the right of recall. His embrace of change is based on more intellectual self-confidence than the old fashioned belief in grabbing the controls of the machinery of the centralised, elitist British state and making it serve Tory ends. New Conservative constitutional reformers can talk confidently about trusting the people, because they believe that the people ultimately agree with them. And left of centre constitutional reformers feel some anxiety that Carswell may be right about this. The interesting debate may end up being between radical Conservative direct democracy, and progressive reformers trying to define the acceptable limits of popular control. </p> <p>Unfortunately, neither front bench seems interested. Labour's increasing timidity about constitutional reform is sad indeed. From the radical change promised (and largely implemented) in 1997, the party now trumpets reforms such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/26/constitution.anglicanism\">changing the Act of Succession</a> to make the first-born, rather than the first-born son, heir to the throne, as radical. This reform affects one, theoretical, person in perhaps 70 years' time. The Conservatives are vaguely aware that the current electoral system is biased against them, but grumble in an entirely ill-informed fashion about constituency boundaries. Their main solution is to try to game the current system better than Labour by swamping marginal constituencies with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/aug/01/electoralreform.partyfunding\">Ashcroft money</a>. It may work in the short term, but it is a cynical exercise in gaining and maintaining power on a minimum of public support that will ultimately do politics no good. It is a sign of how seductive the embrace of the Westminster establishment is that neither main party really intends to do much to shake up the power structure.</p>",
  "<p>The Zimbabwe power-sharing agreement today appeared near collapse after President Robert Mugabe demanded the right to appoint all key cabinet ministers, rendering the opposition toothless at the helm of the country.</p> <p>After an hour-long meeting between the 84-year-old president and prime minister-elect Morgan Tsvangirai, his opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) said it had asked South African mediator Thabo Mbeki to salvage the power-sharing process. </p> <p>However, South African officials tonight could not confirm they had received such a request, amid confusion since Mbeki resigned as president on September 21. </p> <p>MDC spokesman Nelson Chamisa said: \"We want to share power. But Mugabe wants to swallow the MDC. We will not allow that. He wants all the key ministries - finance, home affairs, defence, information, foreign affairs, justice and even women and youth.\" </p> <p>On Monday, after returning from the United Nations General Assembly in New York, Mugabe told a crowd at Harare airport that he would appoint a cabinet \"before the end of this week\", suggesting he would not await the agreement of the MDC. </p> <p>Zimbabwe has been without a government since parliament was dissolved in January ahead of elections on March 29 in which the MDC won a lower house majority and Tsvangirai forced Mugabe to a presidential run-off poll. </p> <p>The violence that preceded the second election, on June 30, prompted the opposition leader to withdraw. Under a power-sharing agreement mediated by Mbeki and signed on September 15, the government was to have 31 ministries. </p> <p>In a bid to reflect the parliamentary election result, 13 of the ministries were to be nominated by Tsvangirai's MDC and a further three by another faction of the MDC, led by Arthur Mutambara. </p> <p>But talks about which ministries would be offered to whom had not been completed before the signing and the process quickly began to falter amid an unrelated power-struggle in South Africa which saw Mbeki ousted as president a week later. </p> <p>In New York last week, Mugabe claimed agreement had been reached on all but four ministries, which he did not name but which were believed to be home affairs, finance, local government and foreign affairs. </p> <p>The international community were looking to the MDC winning control of at least the finance ministry and preferably foreign affairs before resuming full trade relations and ultimately considering lifting travel bans and asset restrictions on leading figures in the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic Front (Zanu-PF). </p> <p>Observers had suggested that Mugabe wanted to retain control of the defence ministry - and therefore the army - but might be prepared to relinquish home affairs - and thus control of the police - to the opposition. </p> <p>But it now appears that negotiations had never reached such an advanced stage. Nor did they progress while Mugabe was in the United States for 10 days.</p> <p>University of Zimbabwe political analyst John Makumbe said the agreement was \"full of holes\" from the start. He said: \"I do not know what the MDC were thinking when they signed it. The agreement left Mugabe with all the powers. It was defective because it never allocated the levers of power. </p> <p>\"Now he has behaved in his predictable fashion. He is not only backing out of the deal but it is clear that he was simply trying to use the MDC as a glove to bring back foreign direct investment. </p> <p>\"By the end of this week we can expect to have a cabinet just as Mugabe wants it. He is under pressure from the old guard in Zanu-PF who do not want to lose their jobs.\" </p> <p>Makumbe shared misgivings expressed by several observers about Mbeki's future role. Despite having been endorsed by the Southern African Development Community and the African Union to continue as mediator, he is seen as lacking clout now that he is no longer president.</p>",
  "<p>British investigations into BAE, Britain's biggest arms company, appear to have revived today after it was disclosed that a key BAE agent has been raided.</p> <p>Investigators from the Serious Fraud Office arranged for the agent, Count Alfons Mensdorff-Pouilly, to be raided in Austria. </p> <p>Austrian prosecutors said the raids were carried out at the request of the SFO investigating allegations of bribery and money laundering. </p> <p>The Austrian police seized a quantity of documents from the home and office of Mensdorff-Pouilly, who has been accused of receiving millions of pounds from BAE for promoting deals. He is the Viennese laird of a Scottish castle.</p> <p>The SFO's investigations into BAE have been controversial as the government stopped its inquiry into Saudi arms deals. Critics have alleged that the government is soft on BAE and has placed the company above the law and effectively made it immune from prosecution - an accusation denied by ministers. </p> <p>Attention has turned to other cases of alleged BAE bribery which the SFO has been investigating. Critics have been sceptical about the prospect of any progress in these investigations. </p> <p>However the SFO has promised to pursue and complete its investigations into alleged BAE corruption in countries including Tanzania, Romania, and South Africa. </p> <p>The SFO has been investigating corruption allegations in a BAE deal in the Czech Republic. The US Department of Justice is also understood to be investigating the Czech deal as part of its inquiries into the British company.</p> <p>US officials have alleged for many years that the Czech deal was corrupt. <br>Mensdorff-Pouilly, who bought Dalnaglar castle in Perthshire, is one of three agents who allegedly handled corrupt payments in the joint Anglo-Swedish deal in which the Czech Republic agreed to lease Gripen fighter planes for \u00a3400m in 2004. </p> <p>Documents obtained by Swedish state television identified secret payments of more than \u00a34m from BAE and alleged that the money was used to pay bribes. According to the documents, BAE agreed to pass the 55-year-old count up to \u00a340m if the aircraft sale was achieved. </p> <p>It is alleged that in the end, a smaller sum was paid through a Panama-registered company when a smaller contract was signed.<br> Today, Gerhard Jorosch, spokesman for the Austrian prosecutors, told the Guardian: \"We searched the premises of Mr Mensdorff-Pouilly at the direct request of the SFO last Wednesday\". He added that the SFO is investigating alleged bribery and money-laundering in the sale of Gripen fighter jets to Hungary and the Czech Republic.  He added :\"Quite a lot of documents were seized and transmitted to the SFO. The SFO and Austrian prosecutors are studying the material\". </p> <p>It is understood that two of the count's business associates were also raided. <br>Harald Schuster, the count's lawyer, said he denied all wrongdoing. \"The Serious Fraud Office does not have anything concrete. They are fishing for something else.\"</p> <p>Last year, the count denied receiving offshore payments when the Swedish TV programme was broadcast.</p> <p>He said his company, MPA, had been paid since 1992 for consultancy services in eastern Europe.<br> Mensdorff-Pouilly, the husband of a prominent Austrian politician, was interviewed last year over the corruption allegations. </p> <p>In a separate controversy he was named in 1995 on a tape recording which alleged that he was the conduit for secret payments from BAE to party funds in Austria in return for sales. He was acquitted for lack of evidence. </p> <p>According to an Austrian press report today, the raids were also carried out at the request of Swiss prosecutors who are investigating BAE over alleged money-laundering. The Swiss prosecutors would not comment. <br> Also under scrutiny is a 2001 deal in which the Hungarian government agreed to lease 14 Gripen planes. </p> <p>The SFO declined to comment. BAE said: \"BAE Systems continues to fully cooperate with the ongoing SFO investigation. As this is a continuing criminal investigation, it would be inappropriate for us to comment on its substance.\" </p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown today sought to calm nerves over the financial crisis, vowing he would continue to take \"decisive action\" and claiming he was confident about the future of Britain.</p> <p>In a quick round of interviews at the end of a tumultuous day in the financial markets, the prime minister insisted that the government was \"dealing with the problems one by one\".</p> <p>\"We have done what is necessary. We will continue to take decisive action. No one should be in any doubt that I'm determined to do everything that's necessary to ensure stability,\" Brown said.</p> <p>\"This is the time to roll up our sleeves and sort out this crisis. Outside the financial system stability is strong ... I'm also confident about the future of Britain.\"</p> <p>Asked about the Irish government's decision to give a full guarantee to savers, Brown said: \"Let's remember that the Irish are dealing with taxpayers' money here. We have got to get what is right and also what is reasonable. Of course we look at every intervention that is necessary to take but I think people can see from our actions so far that depositors have been protected. No UK depositor has actually lost money.\"</p> <p>Brown welcomed pledges of support from opposition leaders for government legislation to protect savings and shore up failing banks, but played down David Cameron's role in the process.</p> <p>The Tory leader made an unscheduled address at the Conservative conference earlier today in which he offered to work with the government to prevent a repeat of the political deadlock in the US. </p> <p>Asked on Sky News about Cameron's intervention today, Brown said: \"I welcome the support for what we are doing. I talked to Mr Cameron and Mr [Nick] Clegg [the Lib Dem leader] last night; we are keeping them in touch with what we are doing. I'm also talking to the Bank of England and major banks, listening to what people are saying. We have the banking bill coming forward in the next few days and I will be pleased if they [the opposition parties] support that.\"</p> <p>Earlier Cameron pledged to work with the government to bring stability to the financial system.</p> <p>\"We can't allow what happened in America to happen here,\" he told Tory delegates as he unveiled a three-point plan to protect Britain from the worst of the economic fallout.</p> <p>\"This is a moment when democracies are being tested,\" Cameron said. \"We need to show that we can deal with the crisis.\"</p>      <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-338125118\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1827865127_gdn-nat-080930-sf-cameron-economy-01-VFa-FLV-4x3.flv\"/> </video>   <p>Cameron called on the government to act without delay when MPs returned to the House of Commons on Monday. He urged Brown to:</p> <p>\u2022 pass legislation to protect failing banks,</p> <p>\u2022 accelerate legislation to protect people's savings,</p> <p>\u2022 and break the self-fulfilling cycling that is reducing banks' ability to lend.</p> <p>\"In Britain we are all in this together, so let's stick together and find a way through,\" Cameron said.</p> <p>\"As if life wasn't already a struggle with the cost of living going up, people are worried this morning about their savings, their mortgages and their pensions.</p> <p>\"People are confused and concerned. They want to know what is going to happen next and how we are going to get out of this mess.\"</p> <p>Cameron announced that he was dropping Tory objections to a key element of the government's banking reform bill to ensure it passed smoothly through parliament.</p> <p>\"We arrived here in Birmingham knowing we faced a very serious economic situation. The reaction to last night's vote in America showed just how serious it is.\"</p> <p>Comparing the current turmoil with the Wall Street crash of 1929, Cameron reminded delegates that it was not the crash itself that sparked the Great Depression, but the flawed policy response and the crisis in the banking system that followed it.</p> <p>\"Everyone needs to know that we are doing everything we can to help you keep your job, your savings, your pension, your mortgage safe, that we are not playing politics with this and we will always do the right thing to protect your life and your future.\" Cameron said.</p> <p>Insisting it was important to set attitudes towards the financial services industry straight, the Tory leader added: \"We must not let anger cloud our judgment. It is easy to see why people are so angry with the bankers today ... There will be a day of reckoning, but that's not today.</p> <p>\"Today is a day for safety, security and for protection ... That doesn't mean excusing inexcusable behaviour.\"</p> <p>Cameron said the Conservative party did not just stand up for big business, it stood up to big business as well.</p> <p>He suggested the financial sector's regulatory authorities ought to work with their European counterparts to reform the international accounting regulation called \"marking to market\", which automatically downgrades the value of banks when the value of their financial assets falls.</p> <p>He blamed this little-known rule for creating a \"self-fulfilling cycle\" that reduced banks' ability to lend.<br> Cameron said he would spell out his analysis of the financial crisis more fully in his keynote speech tomorrow.</p> <p>Clegg called for a \"cast iron guarantee\" that no depositors would lose out. But Brown rebuffed the call, arguing that government plans to extend the present protection level to \u00a350,000 would be sufficient.</p> <p>George Osborne, the shadow chancellor, left the conference early for a meeting with Alistair Darling, the chancellor. </p> <p>He said afterwards: \"I made it clear that the Conservative party stands ready to do whatever we can to help in this extremely difficult situation and bring some stability to the British economy.\"</p>",
  "<h2>The agenda changed</h2> <p>The Tories changed the conference agenda to schedule an emergency statement by David Cameron about the financial crisis. It was the second diary change within three days; on Sunday a celebratory session about election victories was replaced with a more sober session on the economy.</p> <h2>What David Cameron thinks \u2013 in his words</h2> <p>\"I and this party stand ready to help in whatever way is necessary to help the government to do the right thing for the sake of our economy and for our future financial security. We should always be ready - we have always been ready - at a time of national difficulty to put aside party differences to help bring stability and help bring reassurance,\" Cameron said in his emergency statement, promising to help the government get legislation enabling it to rescue failing banks on to the statute book.</p> <h2>What David Cameron thinks \u2013 in John Redwood's words</h2> <p>\"I do believe that David Cameron and George Osborne, like myself ... desperately want lower tax rates and understand if you don't have lower tax rates in this very competitive world we are going to be less prosperous, have fewer jobs and less tax revenue.\"</p> <h2>Michael Gove said children should learn traditional history</h2> <p>\"Instead of being taught about Magna Carta, the Glorious Revolution and the heroic role of the Royal Navy in putting down the slave trade, our children are either taught to put Britain in the dock or they remain in ignorance of our island story,\" the shadow schools secretary said.</p> <h2>Help for have-a-go-heroes</h2> <p>Dominic Grieve, the shadow home secretary, said that the Tories would change the guidelines for the Crown Prosecution Service to make it clear that \"that it is not in the 'public interest' to prosecute those who perform a citizen's arrest in good faith\".</p> <h2>Three strikes and you're out</h2> <p>Chris Grayling, the shadow work and pensions secretary, proposed that any unemployed person who refuses three reasonable job offers should lose benefits for three years.</p> <h2>A shocking statistic</h2> <p>Every 22 minutes a UK teenager tries to commit suicide, Iain Duncan Smith, the former Tory leader, told the conference. He said tackling the social crisis affecting Britain should be a higher priority than tackling the current economic crisis.</p> <h2>A surprise exit</h2> <p>George Osborne, the shadow chancellor, cancelled an appearance at a fringe meeting and left Birmingham for emergency talks in London about the financial crisis with Alistair Darling, the chancellor.</p> <h2>And a surprise arrival</h2> <p>Cherie Blair made her first appearance at a Conservative conference when she spoke at a fringe meeting organised by the Sun. She was heckled when she defended the Human Rights Act.</p>",
  "<p>Being a fan of the middle ages, I was delighted to hear some its virtues being extolled on the conservative fringe. The stage for such an unlikely endorsement was a <a href=\"http://www.policyexchange.org.uk\">policy exchange</a> panel on the question \"What is the post bureaucratic age?\". As well as me, it included, Oliver Letwin urbane Tory policy chief, <a href=\"http://www.charlesleadbeater.net/home.aspx\">Charles Leadbeater</a>, general advisor on modernity and the technological proclivities of 14-year-olds and a frighteningly humorous and sardonic Steve Bundred, CEO of the audit commission.</p> <p>Letwin led the way by giving a historical account of how bureaucracy first arose through the creation of the state by the monarch, who, in wishing to assert and codify his control over the realm, inaugurated a vast centralised system of state control to regulate and direct his subjects. He then concluded that this has led to its modern correlate: a managerial and bureaucratic state wholly unresponsive to its citizens and indifferent to their needs.</p> <p>On a historical point Letwin is right, the late middle ages especially were marked by a vast plurality of horizontal relationships, often overlapping, and a myriad of reciprocal and mutual duties and responsibilities. Likewise it is right that a medieval network of a predominantly horizontal communal and social order, exemplified by the church but also including guilds and agrarian communities organised around differential property relationships, was destroyed by the new vertical \"secular monarchs\". From the 14th century on, they asserted their power and corrupted a pre-existing highly plural and reciprocal community with demands for top-down allegiance, authority and control.</p> <p>Updating and recovering this earlier medieval model for the modern age is of course the task. But it remains an urgent one as Leadbeater (previously advisor to Tony Blair's policy unit) reminded us that all the evidence shows that self-organised groups with delegated budgets making their own informed choices invariably delivered a better service for themselves at lower cost and to everyone's greater satisfaction. It's worth making this point, as many on the left fear that the new localism is just covert Thatcherism, ideological cover for worsening services at lower cost, and that it really constitutes nothing more than state abandonment of the poor. This could be the outcome, but professional and non-partisan opinion counters this critique by stating two truths: there is something wrong about how the state currently works for its citizens. Firstly, vast sums of money have been poured into the public sector often with little return (look at how GPs and hospital consultants managed to <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1570157/Hospital-consultants-paid-more-for-less.html#form\">inflate their salaries</a> while actually doing less work). Secondly, the evidence seems to suggest, and I repeat, that self-organised empowered groups that both commission and receive services can deliver better care for themselves at lower costs to everybody else, thereby, of course, freeing up public money for other social ends. All this was punctuated by Brundred's persistent reminder as to the manifest and ingenious ways that government can and will mis-spend huge amounts of public wealth.<br> What is interesting is that the possibility of a genuinely post-bureaucratic age is what hyper-modernity offers. With the internet democratising knowledge and access, people can group around informed debate and make judgments in a way never possible before. However, the real escape from bureaucracy occurs when communities are formed that reconstitute traditions across time and place such that all relationships within that community become practised and no formal account of their nature and fulfilment is required.</p> <p>Instead actions and behaviour are the subject of unconscious agreement and completion. So conceived, an ancient conservative communitarianism can be married to a hyper-modern network of trade and exchange to the mutual benefit of all.</p> <p><em>Is the future Conservative? a debate by Comment is Free &amp; Soundings magazine will take place in London at Kings Place on October 6 at 7pm.

  "<p>Shares in London and on Wall Street bounced back today amid optimism the rescue plan for the US banking sector could be revived following last night's shock rejection by Congress.</p> <p>After plunging 147 points in early trading, the FTSE 100 staged an unexpected recovery to close up 83.7 points at 4902.5. The Dow Jones industrial average, which plunged by 777.7 points in frantic trading yesterday, rallied 296.92 points to 10662.37 by mid session in New York. The finish surprised traders in London who had braced themselves for another day of red screens after the massive losses recorded on Wall Street on Monday.</p> <p>Britain's battered banks bucked the trend though, with HBOS the biggest FTSE faller closing down 14% amid market speculation that Lloyds TSB could reduce its offer for the troubled lender. Its shares finished down 19.5p at 122.5p.</p> <p>As fears continue to stalk the financial sector, Bank of England governor Mervyn King met Gordon Brown this morning for what No 10 said was a scheduled meeting. There is a growing belief that the Bank of England, as well as the Federal Reserve in the US, will soon cut interest rates to try to ease the crisis - which may also have helped stock markets to rally.</p> <p>In a sombre address this afternoon, the US president, George Bush, called on Congress to pass the US government's proposed $700bn (\u00a3380bn) bail-out of Wall Street.</p> <p>He said America faced a stark choice: \"The consequences get worse every day if we do not act.\"</p> <p>Analysts said there were hopes the deadlock could be resolved. \"I think that a huge amount of pressure is going to be put on leaders. I think that they will eventually come to their senses,\" said Mike Lenhoff, chief strategist at Brewin Dolphin.</p> <p>City commentator, David Buik, agreed. \"The reason for the turnaround is that we headless chickens are facing across the pond and we note that the Dow futures have rallied ... which ventures to suggest that the self-indulgent hillbilly behaviour of Congress will eventually see an agreement to the Hank Paulson plan on Thursday or Friday,\" he said. \"There is no alternative unless they are inviting deep depression, recession and anarchy.\"</p> <p>Politicians worldwide reacted with disappointment to the rejection of treasury secretary Hank Paulson's plan, in a gripping vote in the House of Representatives. Brown said he had lobbied Bush to urge him to find an agreement fast.</p> <p>\"We've obviously sent a message to the White House about the importance that we attach to taking decisive action in America,\" Brown said today. The breakfast meeting at Downing Street this morning between Brown, King and chancellor Alistair Darling came a day after the nationalisation of Bradford &amp; Bingley.</p> <p>Treasury minister Yvette Cooper said the government was keeping in close contact with the Bank of England as the financial crisis developed. \"We obviously need to monitor events very closely. We're disappointed with the events in the US, the fact that they didn't get a deal,\" Cooper told Sky News.<br>David Cameron today announced that he will drop his objections to the government's proposed reforms to the banking sector and urged Brown to introduce the legislation in parliament next week.</p> <p>\"Our focus must be on protecting the financial system,\" Cameron told the Conservative party conference, adding that it was vital not to repeat the political wrangling seen in America.</p> <p>Other stock markets around the world tumbled earlier today, with Japan's Nikkei index closing at its lowest level for more than three years. Trading in Russia was suspended amid fears of panic selling.</p> <p>The bail-out plan was voted down by 228 votes to 205 last night in the House of Representatives, where Republicans refused to support the rescue scheme. Following the drama, the Dow Jones industrial average suffered its worst one-day decline since the 1987 crash.</p> <p>Congress's refusal to support the bail-out is expected to force more banks to fail, both in the US and Europe.</p> <p>Belgian-French firm Dexia was an early victim, with the Belgian government leading a rescue bid today. The Irish government moved to shore up confidence by guaranteeing all bank deposits at the country's six main banks for the next two years \u2014 just days after the country became the first member of the eurozone to fall into recession.</p> <p>\"The government's objective in taking this decisive action is to maintain financial stability for the benefit of depositors and businesses and is in the best interests of the Irish economy,\" said a spokesman.</p> <p>US crude oil fell again to around $95 a barrel today, having plunged by $10 to $96 a barrel last night as traders bet on a slump reducing the need for fuel. Gold also surged yesterday to $915 an ounce, but fell back slightly to $895.</p> <p>US politicians have blamed each other for the rejection of Paulson's plan to buy toxic assets from America's banks. Democrats rejected claims that the speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, had alienated Republicans by blaming the recklessness of the Bush administration.<br>\"The speaker had to give a partisan voice that poisoned our conference,\" said Republican leader John Boehner. This drew ridicule from Democrats. Barney Frank, chairman of the House financial services committee, said: \"Somebody hurt my feelings so I'll punish the country? That's hardly plausible.\"</p> <p>Most Democrats in the House supported the plan, while two-thirds of Republicans opposed it.</p> <p>Critics of the bail-out said they were not prepared to write a blank cheque to the highly paid bankers who had caused the credit crunch. The plan was unpopular with US voters, and it appears those politicians whose seats are most at risk in November's elections had generally voted against the plan.<br>It is now unclear what steps the US government will take. Paulson has said he will continue negotiating to find a plan that can be passed. \"This is much too important to simply let fail,\" he said.</p> <p>Peter Morici, professor of business at the university of Maryland, said: \"Things are going to get so bad something will have to be done in the next few weeks. Banks will sink, credit markets will seize, the economy will go into something much worse than a recession.\"</p> <p>In a Gallup poll for USA Today, 33% of Americans said they believed the country was in a depression.</p> <p>The Mortgage Bankers' Association reacted by warning of job losses as banks curtail credit to small businesses. Larry Fink, chairman of US investment management firm BlackRock, said critics had been wrong to characterise the plan as a bail-out of Wall Street. \"This is a bailout of Main Street,\" he said. \"Banks have no ability to lend at the moment because their balance sheets are so gummed up.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> She's from Paris but lives in London. <br> <strong>The lineup:</strong> Laura B (vocals, bass and \"anything with knobs and flashing lights that makes a sound\"). <br> <strong>The background:</strong> The Fantastic Laura B is the 400th New Band of the Day \u2013 and congratulations to us for being the first to tell you about White Lies, Abe Vigoda, Ladyhawke, VV Brown, Little Jackie, thecocknbullkid, Bryn Christopher, Broken Records, Iglu &amp; Hartley, Wild Beasts, Gotye and Mumford &amp; Sons in the last hundred New Band columns - but the first solo female electronic artist to feature here. This is less an indictment of any policy we might have towards musicians of her type (clue: we don't have one) than a statement about the dearth of studio whizkidettes in the music industry. <br> As though to emphasise Bj\u00f6rk's recent defence of her, and the female musician's, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2008/aug/27/whybjorkisrighttostickup\">role in the recording studio</a>, Laura B (The Fantastic to her friends) is that rarity, a woman who not only writes, sings and performs her own material but also handles all the gadgetry in the studio and does the production (she also DJs around the world, remixes other acts and compiles chillout albums). She might have a breathy girly voice but she can hold her own in the man's world of knobs, plugs and wires. \"It's been crazy because for ages I was just about the only girl in London - and possibly Europe and the world - working everyday in commercial studios,\" she says. \"I had to be the best to survive in this man's world.\"<br> There are some female artists her brand of ambient electronica has been compared to. In some ways she's an Enya or Enigma with edge, a more chillaxed Alison Goldfrapp or a Bj\u00f6rk without the kooky idiosyncrasies, even Massive Attack when they had Liz Fraser on wraith-like vox or the Cocteau Twins when they pursued a more electronic direction in the 90s. But more than anyone her textured atmospherica and lush cinematica recalls Aphex Twin circa the historic Selected Ambient Works, layers of synthesised vocals and sounds billowing across the stereo range. She recently featured alongside everyone from Tangerine Dream to Art of Noise on Radio 2's History of Chillout documentary and there are traces, too, of both those groups' pioneering laidback techno, as well as random FX, glitches, bloops and bleeps that take her music into experimental territory.  If her music evokes the glacial drift of early Aphex Twin, that's no coincidence \u2013 she'd most like to work with Richard D James (aka Aphex) as well as Air. And she's already collaborated with Pet Shop Boys and pedal steel guitar legend BJ Cole and managed to coax a decent performance out of Black Grape even though she spent most of her time with them trying to stop them getting wasted or going AWOL. But it's all good. Just don't call what she does downtempo. \"My music is very uptempo. If anything it's hardcore chillout,\" she insists, before getting carried away. \"My music is all about conscious teleportation to another space and time, into Laura B space and time, where people can experience my dream or their own depending on how they feel. I've got a very leftfield imagination. To me music = science fiction.\" <strong>The buzz:</strong> \"Luscious and lovely, dreamy and creamy chillout, like Zero 7 minus the bits that make you go \"zzzz...'\" </p> <p><strong>The truth:</strong> She's singlehandedly advancing the case for the do-it-all female dance technician. <br> <strong>Most likely to:</strong> Set adrift on memory bliss. <br> <strong>Least likely to:</strong> Come to daddy.<br> <strong>What to buy:</strong> She's currently looking for a label for her album Laura B.

  "<p>Fossils of a 33-foot-long (10.1-metre-long), previously unknown meat-eating dinosaur discovered in South America are delivering insights to scientists on the long-suspected evolutionary relationship between dinosaurs and modern birds.</p> <p>The team that found the fossils, a joint American-Argentinean expedition led by University of Chicago palaeontologist Paul Sereno, says the dinosaur breathed 85m years ago the same way as birds do today: with a unique, bellows-like system.</p> <p>The find suggests many dinosaur species likely were breathing in this manner even before this dinosaur came along and bolsters decades of palaeontological research indicating birds originally evolved from dinosaurs.</p> <p>Found in the Patagonian badlands of Argentina in 1996 and studied in the dozen years since, the dinosaur was introduced to the scientific literature yesterday in the online journal Public Library of Science One.</p> <p>Its name tells much of the story; the dinosaur was dubbed Aerosteon riocoloradensis, or \"air bones\" from the Rio Colorado. </p> <p>Though the size of an elephant, Aerosteon (air-AHHS-tee-on) had many lightweight, hollow, birdlike bones - and that birdlike system of breathing.</p> <p>\"In breathing, bird lungs don't expand and contract,\" Sereno said by telephone from Mendoza, Argentina, where he is attending an international palaeontological meeting. </p> <p>\"Instead birds have a system of bellows air sacs that shunt air through the bird's 'rigid' lungs.\"</p> <p>Because the air passes through the air sacs on a one-way path, bird breathing is thought to be five times more efficient than mammalian breathing. That is because the birds' lungs are always filled with oxygen-rich air, which passes into the lungs from one end and exits depleted from the other.</p> <p>By contrast, as mammal lungs expand and contract, new air is mixed with old, depleted air already present in the lungs, decreasing efficiency.</p> <p>The fossils not only demonstrate the presence of air sacs in Aerosteon's anatomy but also show that the air sac system significantly alters each animal as it matures, by hollowing out bones in its skeleton to make it lighter. That change is crucial for modern birds to fly, but it may have served another purpose in dinosaurs.</p> <p>Sereno suggests that early dinosaurs may have developed the air sac breathing system and grown feathers for temperature control in their bodies and that birds put these anatomical inventions to use for flight millions of years later.</p> <p>\"The thinking used to be that feathers were something that evolved for flight,\" Sereno said, \"but now we are seeing evidence of feathers on dinosaurs that never flew. Feathers and these air sacs may eventually show up as developments coming about in dinosaurs about the same time.\"</p> <p>Brooks Britt, a Brigham Young palaeontologist not connected to Sereno's Aerosteon expedition, called the expedition discovery \"a spectacular specimen\".</p> <p>\"It makes significant progress in elucidating the origins of the bird-style lung,\" he said.</p> <p>Britt has long studied the pneumatic hollowing of skeletal bone in birds and dinosaurs, a process closely related to the air sac system of breathing.</p> <p>After a bird hatches from its egg, all its bones are solid, like mammal bones, Britt said. As the chick grows, its air sacs send out thin strings called diverticulae that attach themselves to nearby bones in the skull, spine, femur and shoulder area. The strings find a weak spot, invade the bone interior, and mine out marrow to leave the bones hollow.</p> <p>The process, called pneumatisation, is critical for birds to remove body weight for flight.</p> <p>For more than a century palaeontologists have seen evidence of pneumatisation of vertebrae and skulls in fossils of most dinosaur species, but those hollows appear to play no role in breathing. The significance of Aerosteon is that the researchers found evidence of air sacs in the rib cage area, which birds use in the bellows breathing process.</p> <p>\"Now that we've seen these, I think we'll see evidence of pneumatisation in other fossils in the future,\" Sereno said.</p> <p>Though the fossils Sereno found were 85m years old, the researchers suspect the species also existed for tens of millions of years before that.</p> <p>The findings reported yesterday began with the expedition team's discovery of two or possibly three individual Aerosteon fossils in the Patagonian dinosaur beds in 1996.</p>",
  "<p>The son of former Liberian president Charles Taylor ran a security force in his father's government with a brutal agenda marked by the beating, burning and beheading of people opposed to his rule, a federal prosecutor said Monday during a landmark torture trial in Miami.</p> <p>Charles \"Chuckie\" Taylor Jr, born in Boston and raised in Orlando, Florida, was tapped by his father to command an anti-terrorist unit called the Demon Forces that cut a man's penis with a sharp knife before dumping him in a dirt pit, Justice Department prosecutor Christopher Graveline said in opening statements.</p> <p>\"You will hear witness after witness tell about the fear they felt when they heard that name,\" Graveline said, referring to the nickname, \"Chuckie,\" that Taylor went by in Liberia from 1999 to 2003 when he served as a security-force boss.</p> <p>The Miami criminal case - taking place at the same time the father<br>faces a war crimes tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands - marks the first US prosecution of torture committed in a foreign country. Taylor, a 31-year-old U.S. citizen, is charged with conspiracy, torture and carrying a firearm during a violent crime.</p> <p>Taylor's court-appointed defence attorney depicted his client as an innocent man who helped protect his father's government against rebels seeking to overthrow it.</p> <p>The defence argued that witnesses wrongly accused Taylor of torture in an attempt to get out of the impoverished, violent African nation.</p> <p>Assistant Federal Public Defender John Wiley said if this case were a newspaper headline it would read: \"Desperate and disgruntled Africans accuse American to escape war-torn Liberia.\"<br>He said some are seeking protected status such as asylum in the United States in exchange for their testimony against Taylor.<br>If convicted of the horrific allegations - burning victims' flesh with molten plastic, shocking their genitals with an electrical prod, ordering the beheading of one victim with a knife - Taylor would spend the rest of his life in prison.</p> <p>Taylor was charged under a 1994 law that permits the federal government to prosecute anyone suspected of carrying out torture outside the United States as long as the suspect is a US citizen, legal resident or is present in this country, regardless of nationality.<br>He was arrested on false passport charges when he arrived in Miami from Trinidad in March 2006.</p> <p>Taylor's goal in the alleged conspiracy was to \"strengthen the power and authority\" of his father's presidency and to \"eliminate actual and perceived opponents and threats to his administration by means of torture,\" according to the indictment.</p> <p>The indictment accuses him of using Liberia's antiterrorist unit to seize, imprison, interrogate and mistreat those opposed to his father's government \"by acts specifically intended to inflict severe physical pain and suffering\".</p> <p>The Taylor trial is expected to last up to eight weeks, said district judge Cecilia Altonaga. Prosecutors will call government agents as well some of the seven alleged victims cited in the indictment.<br>Taylor's attorneys also plan to put on a defence, saying they will call witnesses to testify he did not commit any acts of torture.<br></p>",
  "<p>Take a good bedside manner, a sugar-coated prescription, plenty of medical staff on hand, and what do you have? Yes, the New Cameron Nirvana, where there will be, apparently, no more superbugs, happy doctors and nurses, single rooms instead of crowded mixed wards and patient choice beyond belief.</p> <p>The Tories' health spokesman, <a href=\"http://www.andrewlansley.co.uk/\">Andrew Lansley</a>, must surely have been a GP in a former life, so calm and reassuring is his demeanour. Surrounded by health experts, and with a good sprinkling of doctors and nurses asking helpful questions, Dr Lansley's surgery at the Tory conference was just what the doctor ordered.</p> <p>The Conservatives may be rowing back on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/30/toryconference.conservatives4\">their \"shrink the state\" rhetoric</a> when it comes to the economy, but they still want much less state control of the health service. So the talk was all about devolving power, which will, magically, make the NHS so much better than it is now.</p> <p>Mr Lansley pledged to do away with Labour's targets, which have done so much to reduce waiting times. Instead, \"outcomes\" will be the new test of whether hospitals or GPs are performing well. Exactly how an outcome differs from a target wasn't clear: presumably at the end of the day what matters is how quickly and how successfully patients are cured.</p> <p>There was more motherhood and apple pie stuff. Patients will come first. Nurses will return from form-filling to the front line. Health professionals will decide on priorities, and there will be no more diktats from the centre. Where have we heard this before? I seem to remember the late Robin Cook when he was opposition health spokesman, and all opposition health spokesmen since. If only if it were that easy.</p> <p>As to the government's controversial plan to <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/david_aaronovitch/article3393128.ece\">introduce polyclinics</a> in every primary care trust, well, the Conservatives will have some of them, but smaller GP surgeries will survive too, and just for good measure some medium sized ones as well. Talk about having your cake and eating it.</p> <p>It's easy to mock, but in truth the Conservatives are raising some of the right questions, even if they are not coming up with very realistic answers. They are wise to focus on patients' dignity, the distances patients and their visitors have to travel and raising morale among health service workers. All these are concerns that have been neglected for too long.</p> <p>But Lansley's big announcement \u2013 a pledge to bring in single rooms rather than wards for everyone who has an operation, all new mothers, and all mental health patients \u2013 is not, perhaps, the best use of precious resources. <br>The Conservatives want to double the number of single rooms in hospitals to 84,000 within the next five years, at a cost of \u00a31.57 billion pounds, though that estimate is thought to be conservative by some experts. It doesn't seem to me to be the top priority for patients.</p> <p>But all credit to the Conservatives for devoting a good hour of their conference stage to the issue of caring for the elderly. In a moving speech, the author <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/mar/18/health.terrypratchett\">Terry Pratchett</a>, who has been diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimers, paused frequently during his speech \"while the words on the page moved\" as he gave an insight into life with this incurable disease. It's like a slow motion car crash, he said. The little losses mount up, and sooner or later you know you will go through the windscreen.</p> <p>Social care is an issue rising up the agenda for all political parties. Last week's Labour conference saw <a href=\"www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/24/health.alanjohnson\">packed fringe meetings on the subject</a> too. Pratchett's estimate that by 2025 there will be more than a million people with Alzheimers is only the tip of the iceberg. There will be plenty more with cancer, dementia, Parkinson's and the rest, and the question of how we look after our elderly is going to need a massive rebalancing of the NHS and the care system.</p> <p>The last \u2013 and most pertinent word goes to Pratchett: all parties realise the importance of social care, but is the government willing to put its money where its mouth is? We are all waiting to see.</p>",
  "<p>The government was accused today by the <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives\">Conservatives</a> of being \"silent\" on sharia courts, which must be given no authority over criminal and family law matters in Britain.</p> <p><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/politics/dominicgrieve\">Dominic Grieve</a>, the shadow home secretary, made the criticism as he warned that the government has neglected the threat of radicalisation.</p> <p>\"For all its tough talk on terrorism, the government is dropping the ball on security and radicalisation,\" Grieve said. </p> <p>\"Lax on fanatical preachers. Silent on sharia courts. Let me make our position clear. Sharia courts can be given no authority over criminal and family law matters in Britain. Our law must reign supreme. The next Conservative government will make sure it does.\"</p> <p>Grieve, who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/27/dominicgrieve.conservatives \">told the Guardian last week</a> that multiculturalism has downplayed the identity of \"long-term inhabitants\" and failed to provide a coherent identity for second and third generation immigrants, believes that sharia courts can have a role. He likens them to the Jewish Beth Din, which are acceptable because their rulings do not conflict with English law.</p> <p>The shadow home secretary said that Jewish people are entitled to have \"arbitration under Jewish customary law\". </p> <p>He added: \"The same can perfectly properly comply to sharia law as long as the consequences are also not repugnant to English justice. That's very different from saying that you should allow sharia law to be applied to Muslims in Britain on say crime or domestic violence or anything else ... Somebody has been trying to suggest that they have that sort of imprimatur of respectability. And we have to be quite clear that we all live under one legal system.\"</p> <p>Grieve, who used his conference speech to ensure that \"have-a-go heroes\" are not wrongly arrested, paid a warm tribute to David Davis, whose resignation in June led to his promotion. Davis resigned his Haltemprice and Howden seat and successfully fought a byelection in protest at the government's plans to detain terror suspects without charge for up to 42 days.</p> <p>\"I am the beneficiary of a rather old fashioned thing, an act of principle by a politician: David Davis. David took a stand against Labour's erosion of our freedoms.</p> <p>He took some stick for doing it. But let me tell you something. Last year at the Labour conference Gordon Brown boasted about his ID card scheme. This year, I listened carefully to Gordon Brown's speech. The words ID cards never passed his lips.\"</p> <p>The Tories also reiterated plans today to scrap the automatic early release of prisoners and introduce earned release in prisons in England and Wales. </p> <p>Nick Herbert, the shadow justice secretary, made the announcement amid <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/sep/30/10 \">new evidence which shows</a> that 15,000 long-term offenders have been given the right to automatic release halfway through their sentence under Labour.</p>",
  "<p>A <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives\">Conservative</a> government would turn hundreds of comprehensives into academies, doubling the number of such self-governed schools and making them the \"norm\" of secondary education, the shadow schools secretary said today.</p> <p>To repeated rounds of applause, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/michaelgove\">Michael Gove</a> told the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/toryconference\">Tory conference</a> in Birmingham that the best performing comprehensive schools would be freed from what he called suffocating bureaucracy.</p> <p>The announcement comes on top of the Conservatives' already stated ambition that the Tories would follow the Swedish model of parental choice in allowing communities and parents to set up their own schools.</p> <p>Gove said: \"Not only will we restore to schools all the freedoms they've lost, we'll dramatically expand freedom for professionals. We expect to double the number of academies currently planned. We will be on course for academies \u2013 self-governed schools - to become the norm in secondary education.\"</p> <p>Labour immediately attacked the Tories' plans, saying the policy would cost \"many billions\". Lord Adonis, the junior schools minister, said: \"[Gove] needs to tell us what he would cut to pay for these 5,000 schools. Until he can answer this question, their 'free' schools are just fantasy schools compared to our 1,200 real academies and new or rebuilt schools nationwide.\"</p> <p>David Laws, the Liberal Democrat schools spokesman, questioned whether the Conservatives' schools would indeed be as free as they pledged. Laws said: \"The Tories say they are going to free schools and teachers from central government control, but the small print suggests that they simply want to impose a different set of centralised diktats.\"<br> Gove announced a Conservative ambition to slim down the national curriculum and bolster the teaching of British history in schools.</p> <p>\"Instead of being taught about Magna Carta, the Glorious Revolution and the heroic role of the Royal Navy in putting down the slave trade, our children are either taught to put Britain in the dock or they remain in ignorance of our island story,\" Gove said. </p> <p>Laws said: \"Michael Gove claims he wants to slim down the curriculum, but in the next breath he tells teachers which bits of history they should be teaching. Tory thinking is muddled between the rhetoric of giving back real freedoms and the reality of extra micro-management.\"</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/sep/30/foodanddrink.creditcrunch\">Afternoon tea is making a comeback</a>. Customers are flocking to tearooms and eschewing the ghastly coffee chains with their thick, foaming, sickly, jumbo-sized hugely expensive coffees. </p> <p>Good. About time, too. We need an escape from the raving-mad modern world, and afternoon tea comes from less frenzied times: the tea gardens of the early 18th century, the first Lyons tea houses \u2013 all safe havens for unaccompanied ladies, when half the population wasn't waddling around weighed down by excess fat. And in the 1950s and 60s, we were forever asking people to tea. It saved you the fag of cooking a proper meal, and only lasted an hour or so.</p> <p>But who dares eat cakes nowadays? I thought you needed to be thin and solvent, and have plenty of time and low blood pressure to stuff cakes. About a year ago, I went out to tea with a rather grand but stick-thin editor, and we both ordered a lovely big, creamy cake. The editor was thrilled. She had been having a tough time getting anyone to eat cakes with her until I came along \u2013 too thin, old and greedy to care. Except that I did care a bit, because cakes are so naughty. But that only adds to the thrill of it all \u2013 the added lashings of guilt. </p> <p>Now even the young are catching on. Daughter is forever making cupcakes and is mad on high tea. Last week, she was charmed by a heavenly tearoom in Birmingham with a huge, freshly baked, fluffy scone and Nat King Cole playing softly in the background. </p> <p>Which shows that it's not just the darling little sandwiches, with their lovely soft bread with the crusts cut off, or the heavenly dollops of cream and jam, or the cakes stuffed with custards, fruits, mousses and chocolate, and the delicate, refreshing tea. It's the whole ceremony: the teapot and strainer, the separate jug of milk, the china cup and saucer and tinkle of the stirring spoons. No horrid, booming pop music, no rush, no sitting squashed on a high stool at a bar, no harassed waitresses, no cardboard cups and stick spoons and, best of all, the peace and quiet. Then you can chat, rather than scream, at your companion, perhaps accompanied by a muted string quartet. Bliss. </p> <p>Afternoon tea is still for girls, really. But never go with some po-faced person who only wants her own cake. Only go with chums who like to share. That way you can have tastes of several different cakes and not have to eat the three you can't choose between and end up feeling violently sick. This is, after all, meant to be an elegant little outing.</p>",
  "<p>Cherie Blair was heckled today when she defended the Human Rights Act at a fringe meeting at the Conservative party conference.</p> <p>In her first visit to a Tory event, the former prime minister's wife angered members of the audience when she criticised a member of the shadow cabinet who said that the Human Rights Act should be ripped up.</p> <p>Blair spoke out as she appeared on a panel at a fringe meeting organised by the Sun newspaper to discuss \"fixing broken Britain\". </p> <p>She appeared alongside the communities secretary, Hazel Blears, former home secretary Charles Clarke, the shadow work and pensions secretary, Chris Grayling, and former New York police chief Bill Bratton.</p> <p>During the session Clarke also criticised the government's plans to build three giant so-called Titan prisons, and Bratton, a champion of the \"broken windows\" theory of policing that was credited with cutting crime drastically in New York, said that officers in Britain were being \"crushed\" by Whitehall targets.</p> <p>Blair, who was invited because she recently chaired a commission for Channel 4 on street weapons and who appeared under her married name, was generally given a polite reception by the members of the audience. But they expressed their disapproval loudly after she clashed with Grayling over the HRA.</p> <p>\"The evidence of the past 10 years is that the Human Rights Act has not worked \u2026 We need to tear it up and start again and come up with something that works with the reality of this country,\" Grayling said.</p> <p>Blair said he was being \"specious\". As she tried to say that the HRA was there to protect fundamental rights such as the right to life, some activists heckled her loudly with remarks like \"Please\" and \"We're not saying that\".</p> <p>At one point Paul Bowman, whose daughter Sally Anne was stabbed to death, and who was one of several parents of murder victims speaking at the event, said he thought the HRA should not apply to people like the man who murdered his daughter.</p> <p>And later Terry Bosshard, an activist from Bromley and Chislehurst, claimed that Blair had been instrumental in Labour's decision to pass the act.</p> <p>Blair replied: \"I don't think I can claim any responsibility for bringing in the Human Rights Act.\" But she went on to defend it robustly, saying that it had entrenched rights that had been part of British common law for generations.</p> <p>\"Human rights are always about rights and responsibilities. They are about respect for individuals, so that each individual has the right to be respected,\" she said.</p> <p>\"We should be proud that in our country we do not have an elected dictatorship, and that the courts are there to protect individual rights.</p> <p>\"And, yes, that does apply to the most unpopular people, whether they are criminals, whether they are gypsies, whether they are illegal asylum seekers, because in the end we are a decent society and we believe that everybody is entitled to respect and that has to be policed on our behalf.\"</p> <p>During the debate Jonathan Aitken, the former Tory cabinet minister who was jailed for committing perjury during a libel case against the Guardian, and who was in yesterday's audience, said he was concerned that Labour's plans to build Titan prisons would make it harder for prisoners to be rehabilitated. </p> <p>He said the prisons would be situated \"nowhere near\" the communities where the rehabilitation work had to take place.</p> <p>Clarke replied: \"I'm amazed to say that I agree with Jonathan. I made a speech when I was home secretary arguing strongly for community-based prisons.\"</p> <p>And Bratton, who is now head of the police department in Los Angeles, said he thought there were too many national targets for police officers in the UK</p> <p>\"The national influence on your police is crushing in terms of all of the layers of accountability and goals,\" he said.</p> <p>He said that on a visit to the Tower of London he had seen how \"pressure plates\" used to be used as an instrument of torture. Bratton suggested the national targets were having the same effect as \"pressure plates\" on British police officers.</p>",
  "<p>David Cameron wants to:</p> <h2>Pass legislation to protect failing banks</h2> <p>The Conservatives have today agreed to back government legislation that would enable the Bank of England to rescue failing banks while giving the Financial Services Authority the power to decide when a bank needed to be rescued.</p> <p>The Tories had wanted the Bank of England to have control of both decisions, believing it to be best placed to deal with ailing institutions in a responsible way. </p> <p>However, Cameron said today that what mattered was getting the legislation through quickly so the Conservatives will support the bill and may return to the FSA issue at a later date.</p> <p>The new legislation will mean that if a bank runs into financial trouble, it will be the institutions that lent it the money, rather than taxpayers, that would have to shoulder the loss. The government will reserve the right to nationalise banks as a measure of last resort.</p> <p>This is what George Osborne, the shadow chancellor, meant yesterday when he said there needed to be a half-way house between finding a private sector solution for a failing bank, which may not always be possible, and wholesale nationalisation.</p> <h2>Accelerate legislation to protect people's savings</h2> <p>The Conservatives want the government to rush through new legislation to increase protection for savers. Under the current rules, only the first \u00a335,000 of an individual's money is fully protected should a bank collapse and is not paid out for at least six months.</p> <p>The chancellor has announced that this is to be increased to \u00a350,000 and should be paid out much faster. The Tories want the money repaid within seven days and are hoping the legislation will be passed without delay.</p> <p>Usually there is at least two weeks between the first and second reading of a bill in parliament but the Tories have agreed for this to be cut to one week in this case.</p> <h2>Break the self-fulfilling cycling that is reducing banks' ability to lend</h2> <p>A European Union directive passed in 2001 and adopted as a new accounting standard in the UK in 2006 dictates that banks have to value their assets on a daily basis. To do this they must base their calculations on the market value of each asset if it were liquidated that day.

  "<p>Football's world and European governing bodies Fifa and Uefa have today issued a joint statement in support of the Polish Football Association (PZPN), despite a court suspending the PZPN management board earlier this week and placing the running of football in the country into the hands of an administrator. </p> <p>The PZPN board were suspended for failing to address corruption in the domestic game and for breaking the law, but Fifa and Uefa have said that they do not accept the findings of the arbitration court of the Polish National Olympic Committee, who issued the suspension at a tribunal hearing requested by the Polish ministry of sport.</p> <p>\"Fifa and Uefa continue to recognise the current leadership of the PZPN chaired by Micha\u0142 Listkiewicz as the only legitimate authority to run football in Poland and to represent it internationally,\" read a statement released today by the two governing bodies. \"As a consequence, any letter, correspondence and/or communication, that is not signed by the legitimate and Fifa-Uefa-recognised leadership ... will be ignored and considered irrelevant.\"</p> <p>Fifa do not allow governments to interfere in the running of football associations and today's statement also said that they \"will contact the IOC to assess the situation of the Polish NOC and the violation of fundamental principles of the Olympic and sporting movement, such as the principle of the autonomy of sports federations.\"</p> <p>Poland is due to co-host the 2012 European Championships with Ukraine but other nations, including Scotland, have been alerted to the possibility of the tournament being moved to an alternative country as preparations are thought to be behind schedule.

  "<p>Thousands of older homeowners who took out shared appreciation mortgages (Sams) could take Barclays and HBOS to court over unfair terms following a change in the law, it emerged today.</p> <p>The mortgages, which were offered by the Bank of Scotland and Barclays in the 1990s, were designed to allow homeowners to release equity from their properties but some have been left owing many thousands of pounds to the banks in return for relatively small loans. </p> <p>Around 15,000 people are thought to have taken out a Sam during the brief period between 1996 and 1998 they were on the market. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2007/aug/04/debt.mortgages\">Last year, we wrote</a> about a severely disabled 93-year-old man who had borrowed \u00a317,000 in 1998 and had to pay back Barclays a total of \u00a3116,000 when he was forced to sell his property to meet care costs. </p> <p>A recent change to consumer credit laws means those borrowers who still have a Sam could sue the banks to change the terms of their contracts and reduce the amount of they need to repay.</p> <p>If successful, the case could cost the lenders hundreds of millions of pounds, according to law firm RWP. </p> <p>The firm plans to act on the borrowers' behalf in a group action to take the banks to court. </p> <p>Hilary Messer, head of litigation at RWP, said: \"If the courts accept our argument that the relationship between debtors and creditors is unfair it opens a door for the courts to revise the terms.\"</p> <h2>Two schemes</h2> <p>There were two types of Sam scheme, one offering interest-free loans and one with a fixed rate of interest. </p> <p>Under the interest-free scheme, homeowners were able to borrow up to 25% of the value of their property. This was to be repaid, along with up to 75% of the appreciation of the value of the property, when the home was sold. </p> <p>With the fixed-interest scheme, people were able to borrow up to 75% of the value of their property. They would then typically owe the bank 75% of the value of the property as well as the repayment of the loan capital, as well as the interest on top. </p> <p>If house prices had fallen borrowers with zero-interest products could have been left with just the capital to repay, but property prices have rocketed over the past 10 years. According to the Nationwide, a house worth \u00a3100,000 in 1997 would now be worth \u00a3282,251. </p> <p>A homeowner who borrowed 25% of \u00a3100,000 interest free, with the promise to repay 75% of appreciation, would now owe the bank \u00a3136,688 on top of the \u00a325,000 they initially borrowed. </p> <p>Faced with having to pay off the loan if they move, many homeowners are stuck in their properties. </p> <p>Barclays has implemented a <a href=\"http://www.woolwich.co.uk/mortgages/shared-appreciation-mortgages.html\">Hardship Scheme</a> for customers who need to move or alter their homes.

  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-338117822\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1827897532_gdn-nat-080925-sf-rspb-04-16x9.flv\"/> </video>   <p>British birdwatchers trying to stop the illegal killing of some of Europe's rarest birds in Malta have become embroiled in an increasingly tense standoff with local hunters and say they have recovered unprecedented numbers of carcasses of protected birds. </p> <p>Thirty British volunteers and a delegation of five staff from the RSPB have spent the last two weeks documenting the shooting of birds of prey such as osprey, honey buzzards, and marsh harriers as they fly over over the Mediterranean island on annual migratory routes. The volunteers estimate scores of rare birds protected by EU laws have been killed this year and claim the shootings have reached a new high. </p> <p>The carcasses of dead raptors are not usually recovered as hunters tend to take them as prizes and are anxious to hide the evidence. But in just eight days the camp recovered 17 shot raptors this year - more than double the total number recovered by similar-sized groups of volunteers in the previous two years put together. </p> <p>This year the birdwatchers, who say the hunting is threatening British conservation projects, also claim they have faced increasing verbal abuse, intimidation and sabotage. Their camps have been vandalised, tyres on their vehicles have been punctured and they are regularly told to \"fuck off back to England\". </p> <p>The standoff threatens to escalate into a minor diplomatic incident after the hunters, who claim they are merely exercising an ancestral tradition, complained to the RSPB's patron, the Queen. They also plan to complain to the European commission about invasion of privacy.</p> <p>They accuse the RSPB of \"dishonest\" campaigning designed to \"undermine Maltese culture\". And they say there is no proof that hunting on the island threatens endangered species.</p> <p>Malta and the neighbouring island of Gozo are a key stopover point for hundreds of thousands of migratory birds as they make the journey from Europe to spend winter in Africa. </p> <p>But Malta is also home to the highest concentration of registered hunters anywhere in Europe. And at this time of year thousands engage in the island's popular pastime of bird shooting.</p> <p>They say they are only hunting turtle dove and quail, which is legal during autumn. But each year local conservationists estimate that thousands of birds, from species protected under European laws, are also shot, in many cases deliberately. </p> <p>Grahame Madge, an RSPB spokesman, said: \"It's like a war zone, the smell of death is everywhere.\"</p> <p>\"The scale of the slaughter is unimaginable and it's a race against hunters every moment.\"</p> <p>Few of the hunters are ever caught for illegal killings, and if they are, they typically escape with a \u20ac100 fine.</p> <p>The RSPB has recruited volunteers to attend so called Raptor Camps over the island to monitoring migration and reporting illegal hunting. The camps are organised by the RSPB sister organisation Birdlife Malta and include volunteers from all over Europe. The camp's methods, which include filming illegal killing and posting the footage to YouTube, have enraged local hunters.</p> <p>The more the group has recorded illegal hunting, the uglier the standoff with the hunters has become.</p> <p>\"We have had regular drive-by abuse from hunters shouting 'fuck off back' to England,\" said Nick Unwin, a teacher from Surrey. </p> <p>\"Every time we get into cars we have to look for nails, and in most places we have to have security guards with us,\" he said. Over the last week cars have been attacked and punctured, abusive graffiti has been sprayed on nature reserve signs and used car oil was poured over an observation tower.</p> <p>\"Intimidation and hostility is constant here,\" says Steve Bentall, a wildlife management masters graduate from Hampshire.</p> <p>\"We were at the side of a road and hunters in cars came down the road at about 70mph and started intentionally swerving into us to scare the life out us.\"</p> <p>But Bentall's passion for birds of prey means he won't be put off. \"Two mornings ago we saw a rare Eleonora's falcon. It was a fantastic spectacle and then it got shot. It breaks your heart.\"</p> <p>He adds: \"Some of these birds are down to there last few hundred pairs in Europe. If we don't tackle illegal shooting, we are going to lose more species.\"</p> <p>\"These are legally protected species and they have been for 30 years, and yet they are still slaughtering them. I just can't get my head round it.\"</p> <p>Steph Charlton, a zoo keeper from the Isle of Wight, witnessed a honey buzzard and osprey being shot.</p> <p>\"In the UK we spend thousands of pounds on high profile osprey projects. Then they fly over here and are shot down. It's crazy. I didn't realize how blatantly they do it.\" </p> <p>Dr Andre Raine, BirdLife Malta's conservation manager said: \"This is the worst season that many local birdwatchers can remember. \"If we can recieve 17 birds of prey with confirmed gunshot injuries in eight days, then the actual number of protected birds being shot must be very high.\" </p> <p>The organisation's spokesman claims the abuse from hunters over the last two years has included drive by shootings, bird watchers being spat at, and car tyres being slashed. But he claimed the attacks over the last fortnight are \"worse than usual\".</p> <p>He claimed backlash by hunters is being whipped up by \"threatening and xenophobic\" statements by islands' hunting lobby the Federation for Hunting and Conservation, or FKNK.</p> <p>The federation condemns illegal hunting but it has taken a combative attitude to RSPB and its volunteers.</p> <p>It claims the RSPB and Birdlife Malta exaggerates the extent of illegal shooting there is no hard evidence of a bird massacre.</p> <p>It accuses the RSPB of conducting a \"despicable and fictitious crusades against tiny Malta\" and claims their conservationists are \"foreign mercenaries\". </p> <p>It warns the RSPB against getting involved in \"social hatred campaigns\" aimed at destroying hunting which it describes as a \"Maltese ancestral tradition\".</p> <p>The federation secretary Lino Farrugia refused to speak to the Guardian. But in a press statement he denied the federation had encouraged intimidation. </p> <p>He said: \"The RSPB have far better things to do than organise visits to the Maltese islands solely to pester, interfere and further antagonise Maltese law-abiding nationals.\" </p> <p>He added: \"Out of the odd 260 reports of illegal hunting that BirdLife alleged to have received, the police to date have only arraigned seven persons with hunting related offences, out of which only three refer to illegal hunting.\" </p> <p>Birdlife Malta claims convictions are rare because there are so few police dealing with the problem as the Maltese government refuses to take it seriously. </p> <p>Birdlife's president, Joseph Mangion, said: \"As long as the police fail to take action and the government remain silent, the situation is likely to get worse.\"</p> <p>The government of Malta has yet to respond.</p>",

  "<p>Gurkha veterans who were refused visas to settle in the United Kingdom because they retired from the regiment before 1997 were treated unlawfully and the policy used to reject them was misleading, a high court judge said today. </p> <p>In a damning ruling for the Ministry of Defence, Mr Justice Blake said its advice to the Home Office on whether to grant settlement to the Gurkhas was confusing, resulting in \"irrational and unlawful\" restrictions being applied. </p> <p>The policy needed \"urgent revisiting\", he said, setting a deadline of three months. The Home Office, he added, should \"take political responsibility for the outcome where it is answerable to the electorate\". He ordered the Home Office to pay 80% of the costs of the case. </p> <p>Today's ruling could open the door to more than 2,000 Gurkhas who have had their visas rejected under the misleading policy.</p> <p>Citing the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/sep/30/military.immigration1\">historic military covenant</a> \u2013 which provides UK armed forces and their families with proper care, in return for asking them to risk making \"the ultimate sacrifice for their country\" \u2013 the judge said: \"Rewarding long and distinguished service by the grant of residence in this country for whom the service was performed would be a vindication and an enhancement of this covenant.\"</p> <p>Five Gurkha veterans and a regimental widow sought a judicial review of the refusal to grant them entry visas on the grounds that they had \"no strong ties\" to the UK.</p> <p>Entry clearance officers working for the British embassy in Nepal rejected the Gurkhas through what the judge said was an ambiguous policy that \"irrationally excluded material and potentially decisive considerations that the context and the stated purpose of the policy indicates should have been included\". </p> <p>The law was \"so unclear as to permit conflicting decisions\". It failed to take into account years served, whether injuries were inflicted and whether medals of valour \u2013 including the Victoria Cross \u2013 were won.</p> <p>The government argued that since the Gurkhas' regimental headquarters were in Hong Kong until 1997, the soldiers did not develop close enough ties to the UK.</p> <p>Hundreds of ex-Gurkhas gathered outside the high court to await the ruling, along with the actor Joanna Lumley, whose father served with the Brigade of Gurkhas for 30 years. </p> <p>Mr Justice Blake's ruling condemned the basis of the policy that excluded the Gurkhas. \"Transparency and clarity are significant requirements of instructions to immigration and entry clearance officers that are published to the world at large, generate expectations of fair treatment and bind appellate bodies in the performance of their statutory functions,\" he said.</p> <p>The government's policy either \"irrationally excluded material and potentially decisive considerations\" or else was so ambiguous as to be misleading for both applicants and immigration officials.</p> <p>He compared the Gurkhas' situation to that of Commonwealth soldiers, who are automatically allowed to stay in the UK after four years' service. </p> <p>Another \"inconsistency\" was the failure of Gurkha veterans of the Falklands war to obtain visas, he said, contrasting this with the government's treatment of Falkland islanders. It seemed \"curious\" for the Home Office to conclude that the islanders were sufficiently connected with the UK to be allowed residence \"but those who risked their lives and limb to bring them their freedom did not\".</p> <p>Last year, a government review allowed Gurkhas to apply to settle under a policy known as the Armed Forces Concession, which gives a soldier serving with the British army the right to settle in Britain after four years of service anywhere in the world. For Gurkhas alone, the policy drew a line in the sand at July 1, 1997. </p> <p>Mr Justice Blake questioned why the witnesses for the government were from the MoD, yet the MoD had submitted to the courts that the policy was \"outside the province of that department\". </p> <p>The MoD wrongly advised the Home Office that the Nepali government did not want its nationals who had become Gurkhas discharged in the UK but instead wanted them returned to Nepal. The court was told this had never been the case.</p> <p>The Gurkhas were not, however, discriminated against on grounds of race, a claim that the judge ruled to be \"wholly unfounded\".</p> <p>Greeting the ruling on the court steps, Martin Howe, the human rights lawyer representing the Gurkhas, called the ruling \"a tremendous and historic victory\".</p> <p>\"It is a victory for common sense; a victory for fairness; and a victory for the British sense of what is 'right',\" he said. \"My clients, and the thousands of Gurkhas standing behind them, ask for nothing more from this country than the unfettered right to live amongst the British people - a people they have protected and loved throughout years of long and loyal service to the crown.\"</p> <p>Lumley said the judgment had given the government the \"chance to right great wrongs and wipe out a national stain\" and vowed the campaign would continue until the policy was rewritten.</p>",

  "<p>Debate over <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/bskyb\">Sky</a>'s market influence over how much we pay to watch football is the pay-TV equivalent of <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107048/\">Groundhog Day</a>. </p> <p>So will today's news that regulator <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/ofcom\">Ofcom</a> may <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/sep/30/ofcom.bskyb\">force Sky to make its football and movies cheaper</a> to competitors lead to cheaper pay-TV packages for us? </p> <p>The debate over Sky has raged since Alan Sugar - then an object of derision for Spurs fans and manufacturer of white satellite dishes rather than a gruffly loveable TV star - was overheard telling then Sky chief executive Sam Chisholm to \"blow them out of the water\" to secure the TV rights to the fledgling <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/premierleague\">Premier League</a>. Was Sky an 800lb gorilla crushing the competition underfoot? Or a British success story that improved the entertainment options of millions and turned the Premier League into the glitziest, richest and often greatest sporting show on earth? Probably a bit of both. </p> <p>First, a bit of context. In the past 16 years, rivals have perpetually complained that Sky's dominance of premium movies and sport has hampered their ability compete. ITV Digital, the mismanaged train wreck undone by misguided strategy and poor technology, complained that Sky's wholesale rates helped to send it bust. Cable companies accused Sky of hampering growth by adhering to the letter of the law to ensure it sold premium content at a fair price - but consistently flouting the rules in spirit. NTL and Telewest blew billions before merging and becoming <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/virginmedia\">Virgin Media</a>, which promptly became the loudest complainant to date. Meanwhile, a new breed of competitors - Setanta, Top Up TV, BT Vision - queued up to complain that Sky was unfairly using its position in the market. </p> <p>Ofcom's stab at solving this perennial puzzle boils down to revamping the rules that currently apply to cable - forcing Sky to offer its movie and sports channels to rivals at a reasonable price - and extending them to everyone. Price will be set by a formula based on the \"retail minus\" principle. In other words, Ofcom will look at how much Sky sells its channels for and deduct the costs, using the outcome to set a wholesale price for its rivals. What will this mean to the average punter? Presuming the proposals survive the consultation process unscathed, Ofcom thinks it would lead to lower prices, more choice and greater innovation. Critics, particularly those in Osterley, think it might mean the opposite.</p> <p>It could give Setanta - which faces a tough struggle to boost subscriber numbers, having shelled out hundreds of millions of pounds on rights - a boost. It would be able to buy Sky's channels, bundle them and sell them at an attractive price - perhaps even as a loss leader - to boost its own subscribers. </p> <p>Operators like Top Up TV could offer Sky premium channels as an add-on to Freeview. In these cash-conscious times, might the idea of Freeview plus Sky Sports be an appealing idea for a significant minority of Sky subscribers?</p> <p>Sky argues that it has won all its rights in free and fair auctions and, having gambled billions on building its business, should be free to reap the rewards. And it will point to Setanta's very existence and the European Commission directive to make sure at least one package of Premier League rights goes to a rival as evidence that the market is working. </p> <p>Nowadays people make their pay-TV and broadband choices based on a host of factors from customer service to technology to choice, not just on how much it costs to see Arsenal play. </p> <p>The truth is that the outcome could have been much worse for Sky and, while it will do little to change chairman <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/jamesmurdoch\">James Murdoch</a>'s less than rosy view of regulation in general and Ofcom in particular, less partisan observers will probably chalk it down as a draw. Analysts have already suggested as much, with UBS saying this morning that the Ofcom proposals could lead to a \"fair outcome\" and a \"swift resolution\" for Sky. </p> <p>The most interesting - and potentially damaging - unintended consequence could be on the value of rights. Will Sky's rivals be as keen to engage in a head-to-head auction for Premier League rights, say, in the knowledge they are guaranteed access to the games at a regulated price anyway? </p> <p>The Premier League was banking on another bumper haul when the rights come up for auction again next year, but if Ofcom's proposals remain unchanged the ripples will reach all the way from the living room to the football pitch.</p>",
  "<p>\"<a href=\"http://www.voanews.com/dari/2008-09-29-voa1.cfm\">Killing Malalai Kakar</a> was an unmanly thing to do,\" said a UN official in Kandahar after Afghanistan's most famous policewoman was murdered this week. </p> <p>Ordinarily in Afghanistan, the shooting of a woman by two armed men on motorbikes would be considered naamardi - cowardly or, literally, unmanly. But Kakar was no ordinary woman: she was a senior police officer who had shot dead three men about to launch a suicide attack. When the press approached her at the time, she said that kind of thing <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/persian/afghanistan/story/2008/09/080928_ram-kandahar-killing.shtml\">happened every day</a> in her line of work. </p> <p>Yesterday, the Taliban <a href=\"http://quqnoos.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1700&amp;Itemid=48\">claimed responsibility for Kakar's killing</a>, saying she had been a long-term target. In a perverse nod to gender equality, in killing her, they acknowledged that an Afghan woman can be as deadly an enemy as any man.</p> <p>Unusual as she clearly was, Malalai Kakar was also part of a long-standing tradition of Afghan women who \"outman\" their men in bravery. These are women who take sides in wars, taking up arms for or against the government. In the past, such women used to be mainly the stuff of legends. They were admired and held up as role models but not feared, since they weren't real. </p> <p>Early Afghan historical works are full of such women. Reminiscent of the epic German poem the Nibelungenlied, these tales of warriors, horses and fortresses feature young women such as Shah Bori, described as a girl with a taste for male clothing and horse riding. She is said to have liked living the life of a warrior, refusing for a long time to get married. She is also said to have died fighting the troops of King Babur, in the 16th century. </p> <p>Then there's Nazauna, who, legend has it, single-handedly protected the Zabol fortress with her sword; that was in the 18th century. And in the 19th century, there was the original Malalai, after whom Malalai Kakar was named: Malalai of Maiwand, who turned her headscarf into a banner and led a successful rebellion against the British. </p> <p>But for a long time, Afghan girls could only read about these women and fantasise about being one of them. In real life, their biggest adventure was walking alone between home and school. </p> <p>That was in the times of peace; then the communist coup of 1978 and the subsequent wars changed things, and real Afghan women proved themselves every bit as courageous as their legendary role models. </p> <p>In recent decades, the first girl to make a name for herself by living up to the heroines of the past was a 16-year-old schoolgirl by the name of Nahid. In February 1980, Nahid <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Fragmentation-Afghanistan-Formation-Collapse-International/dp/0300095198\">led a demonstration</a> of schoolgirls and female university students on the streets of Kabul. It was one of the very first public protests testing the loyalty of the communist regime's army and police force. Would the government shoot at unarmed schoolgirls and students? The answer, it turned out, was a firm yes. Soviet helicopters were soon heard hovering over the protesters, and shooting soon followed. Nahid fell immediately, and so did many of her companions. </p> <p>The people of Kabul were stunned: this was naamardi of serious proportions. Nahid was immediately declared a heroine, a contemporary Malalai of Maiwand. Her death was tragic but also reassuring: Afghanistan was still capable of producing courageous, patriotic women who had no fear of death - just like those in the country's founding myths. </p> <p>In 1982, a few years after Nahid's demonstration, Malalai Kakar joined the Afghan police force. At the time, she would have been considered brave and patriotic by some sections of Afghan society; others would have seen her as a traitor, for collaborating with the Soviet-backed government. The same split opinion is probably true today, after her death. </p> <p>The Taliban killed Kakar because she worked for an Afghan government with the backing of international armed forces. But many other Afghans see Kakar as a patriot who risked her life to ensure the security of her fellow Afghans. This is also what President Karzai said when he \"sharply condemned\" Kakar's assassination, calling her a woman who toiled for the safety of all Afghans. </p> <p>Around the time when Kakar first joined the police force, another Afghan woman, called Bibi Ayesha, made the opposite decision. Her son was a mujahid who had been killed by the Soviet-backed army. Bibi Ayesha set off to avenge her son, and rumour has it that she killed her son's murderer with her own bare hands. That was the start of her career as the militia commander who later became known as Commander Kaftar. Her career has since stretched over almost three decades, and she fought against almost everyone: the Soviets, the Taliban and, more recently, the Karzai administration. In June 2008, she was captured and told a press conference: \"I had to sell my cows to buy weapons.\" </p> <p>The people in her native province, Baghlan, still fear her and want her kept in captivity. In July this year, an anonymous local told the Institute for War and Peace Reporting: \"Kaftar has joined hands with the Taliban commander Mullah Khodaidad, who recently fled the Bagram prison.\" Together with another commander, the source said, the three of them were controlling the local drug routes. </p> <p>Kaftar is presently still in custody, and denies all charges against her. There is, however, one charge she proudly admits to: that when she fought the Taliban, she had <a href=\"http://www.iwpr.net/index.php?apc_state=hen&amp;s=o&amp;o=p=arr&amp;l=DR&amp;s=f&amp;o=345979\">2,000 men under her command</a>.</p> <p>Neither Kakar nor Kaftar are feminists in the conventional, or even the unconventional, sense: what they represent is an alternative model of Afghan womanhood that is much older than the Taliban, the mujahideen or the communists. In that sense, we can rest assured that even though Malalai Kakar is dead, the female spirit she represented will live on.</p>",
  "<p>The news that <a href=\"http://www.guttmacher.org/media/nr/2008/09/23/index.html\">the abortion rate in the US has fallen to its lowest level since Roe v Wade</a> seems, at first, unambiguously heartening. After all, despite what some on the right may think, no one, not even the most zealous pro-choice activist, likes abortion. Even if you don't think there's anything immoral about terminating an unwanted pregnancy, it is always painful for the woman involved, both physically and, in many cases, emotionally. So it seems like great news that, according to a new study by the Guttmacher Institute, America's premier sexual and reproductive health thinktank, abortion rates, declining since 1990, reached a three-decade low in 2004, the last year for which data is available. <br> Before we start celebrating, though, it's worth noting that while abortion has declined, accidental pregnancy has not. It would be fantastic if American abortion rates had gotten so low because, thanks to better access to family planning, fewer women were finding themselves pregnant when they didn't want to be. But according to a previous Guttmacher study, about <a href=\"http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/3002498.html\">49% of pregnancies in the US are unintended</a>, a number that's been <a href=\"http://www.guttmacher.org/media/nr/2006/05/04/index.html\">pretty consistent</a> since the mid-1990s. Certainly, not all of those pregnancies were regarded as calamities. For some women, they were probably happy surprises. But there is no reason to believe that unintentional fecundity is any more welcome now than it was in the past. Yet more women are carrying their unplanned pregnancies to term. Is that a good thing?<br> If it's really a result of women's choices, it's certainly not a bad thing. Perhaps American women are becoming more anti-abortion, and are acting on that conviction, which no one can argue with. Yet there's evidence that part of the reason abortion rates are falling is because, due to increased restrictions and a shrinking number of providers, women are finding it harder to terminate their pregnancies. \"Based on the knowledge that we have, we think [the decline] is kind of a mixture of decreased access, at least for some women in some parts of the country, and, for some populations of women, better use of contraceptive methods,\" said Rachel Jones, a senior research associate at Guttmacher who served as the abortion study's project manager.  Wyoming, for example, measured one of the steepest declines in its abortion rate - a decrease of more than 73% since 1996. At the same time, it's become much harder to get an abortion in that state. Since 1996, there's been a 21% increase in the number of Wyoming women who live in counties without an abortion provider. The state <a href=\"http://www.planetjh.com/news/Article.aspx?ArticleID=103980\">once had eight doctors</a> performing abortions. Now <a href=\"http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/sfaa/wyoming.html\">it has two</a>.<br> For the anti-abortion movement, no doubt, this is good news. And it cuts against evidence from other countries showing that there is very little connection between abortion's legal availability and its incidence. Worldwide, some of the highest abortion rates are in South America and East Africa, both regions that also have some of the world's strictest abortion laws. (In 2004, America's abortion rate - the number of abortions per 1,000 women, was 19.7. Compare that to <a href=\"http://www.guttmacher.org/media/nr/2007/10/11/index.html\">World Health Organisation figures</a> which show that there are 29 unsafe abortions per 1,000 women in Latin America and the Caribbean, and a startling 39 per 1,000 women in East Africa). The Guttmacher study, then, offers some evidence that anti-abortion legislation can do what it sets out to do, which is to prevent women with unwanted pregnancies from ending them.<br> For those who care about reproductive rights, though, the news from Guttmacher is far more mixed. Recently, there's been lots of talk about abortion reduction as a bipartisan approach to an issue that perennially inflames American politics. This approach has much to recommend it, as long as it focuses the underlying problem, which is unwanted pregnancy. So far, the US record on that front is spotty. America has been pretty successful in <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/12/05/AR2007120501208.html\">tackling the teen pregnancy rate</a>, which has gone down overall, but less successful in getting contraceptives to adult women who need them. We still have insurance plans that <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/07/AR2008070702265.html\">cover Viagra but refuse to pay for birth control</a>, and far too many women who don't have any reproductive healthcare at all. <br> Anti-abortion campaigners sometimes say that women deserve better than abortion, and they're right. They deserve help in protecting themselves, as much as possible, from unwanted pregnancy. Until there's a healthcare system that does that, it's hard to see much progress.</p>",
  "<p>A former lawyer for <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/heathledger\">Heath Ledger</a></strong> has launched a suit against the late actor's insurance company for allegedly refusing to pay out the $10m (\u00a35.5m) in benefits due to Ledger's two-year-old daughter. John S LaViolette maintains that ReliaStar insurance company, with whom the 28-year-old Dark Knight star took out a life insurance policy in 2007, claim the policy is null and void because his death in January this year was suspicious and possibly a suicide, even though officials have ruled that he died from an accidental overdose of painkillers and other medicines. LaViolette claims that he is also listed as a beneficiary in Ledger's policy and is suing to get the money for Matilda Rose, Ledger's daughter from his marriage to Michelle Williams. ReliaStar has stated that it is entitled to investigate because Ledger died within two years of taking out the policy and called the lawsuit \"premature\" as no decision had been made on the claim. A hearing is scheduled for December 1.<br> </p> <p><strong>Kirsten Dunst</strong> is reported to have ruled herself in for a <a href=\"http://splashpage.mtv.com/2008/09/29/kirsten-dunst-talks-spider-man-4-is-she-in-or-out/\">return in Spider-Man 4 and 5, according to MTV.com</a>. The actor, who has appeared in all three films in the box-office record-breaking superhero franchise, had previously said she would join in if director Sam Raimi and co-star Tobey Maguire also signed up. Given that both men have now said yes, MTV.com put the question to Dunst during interviews for her new film How to Lose Friends and Alienate People, with Simon Pegg. \"I'm in,\" she said, before backtracking somewhat when asked to make an official confirmation. \"I'm not saying anything, I know there's rumours,\" she said.</p> <p>Michael Bay will follow the trend for using <a href=\"http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117993103.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1\">Imax cameras to film major action sequences</a> on blockbuster titles on <strong>Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen</strong>, according to Variety. Christopher Nolan set the mark when he shot six sequences using the larger 70mm cameras on The Dark Knight, while Jon Favreau has said he intends to do something similar on Iron Man II. Hollywood likes Imax because it makes more cash for each ticket sold at the venues, which boast larger screens with 3D capability. Bay will film at least three sequences using Imax cameras on the new Transformers, which is currently shooting for a June 26 release.</p>",
  "<p>So word has leaked out about one of those additional things that Sarah Palin knew nothing about in an interview with Katie Couric \u2013 and from someone in the Palin camp, no less, for reasons clearly of their own devising if somewhat inscrutable to me. From <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/jonathanmartin/0908/In_reintroduction_Palin_to_do_more_interviews_and_tell_her_story.html\">Jonathan Martin's blog</a> at the Politico:</p> <blockquote> <p>Of concern to McCain's campaign, however, is a remaining and still-undisclosed clip from Palin's interview with Couric last week that has the political world buzzing. </p> <p>The Palin aide, after first noting how \"infuriating\" it was for CBS to purportedly leak word about the gaffe, revealed that it came in response to a question about supreme court decisions. </p> <p>After noting Roe v Wade, Palin was apparently unable to discuss any major court cases. There was no verbal fumbling with this particular question as there was with some others, the aide said, but rather silence.</p> </blockquote> <p>Let's not pussyfoot around this. </p> <p>This is appalling. Remember, and always remember: if McCain-Palin are elected, Palin stands a better chance of actually becoming the president than any vice-presidential nominee since, well, probably since Harry Truman, who did. </p> <p>So we might elevate to the presidency someone who can produce the name of only one supreme court decision. </p> <p>For my British readers, let me explain something. Een mai cahntree, the supreme court has a particular aura and lore. One learns about the court as a schoolchild. A special tone of reverence often creeps into teacher's voice. If nothing else one is taught pretty early and pretty thoroughly the following: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marbury_v._madison\">Marbury v Madison</a> (1803) set the precedent of judicial review; the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dred_Scott_v._Sandford\">Dred Scott decision</a> (1857) upheld slavery; <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plessy_v._Ferguson\">Plessy v Ferguson</a> (1896) upheld segregation; and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_v._Board\">Brown v Board of Education</a> (1954) ended it. </p> <p>For the mildly curious American of Palin's (and my) generation, round two of supreme court schooling might include <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Nixon\">United States v Nixon</a>, in which the court unanimously ordered Richard Nixon to turn over the Watergate tapes, which forced Nixon's resignation; <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baker_v._Carr\">Baker v Carr</a>, which established the principle of one person, one vote; <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regents_of_the_University_of_California_v._Bakke\">University of California v Bakke</a>, in which the court initially upheld affirmative action; and of course <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade\">Roe v Wade</a>.</p> <p>I am not saying that every American knows or should know these eight decisions. Lord knows most Americans probably don't know how many justices sit on the court (now that I think of it, probably a good question for Palin). But it seems to me not too much to ask that someone who might be the vice-president or even president of the United States should know them, and many more important court decisions.</p> <p>This is insanity. I understand that there are people who don't think it matters that a candidate knows anything about American history. If she's \"like me,\" that's enough. Well, I'm sorry, but if she's \"like you\" and you can name only one supreme court decision from all of history, then that's not enough to be the vice-president and help run the country, and I'm not an elitist for saying so. </p> <p>And of course there is something to be read into the fact that she knows only Roe. Obviously, there are millions of evangelicals and other abortion opponents who aren't blithering fools and who feel passionately about Roe but also know a lot about the high court. So I'm not saying all abortion opponents are like her, by a long shot. </p> <p>I am saying that it tells us something revealing about her world view that her sense of intellectual responsibility to learn about the court doesn't extend to a single other area. And indeed her curiosity about the law of her country and this unique evil of abortion (as she surely thinks of it) doesn't even extend to her feeling the need to learn a thing about the other major abortion-related decisions! </p> <p>We are far, far down the rabbit hole here. A part of me would like, at Thursday's night debate, to see moderator Gwen Ifill, one of America's finest television journalists, ask Palin some simple factual questions, just basic things about our history and our system of government. </p> <p>But Ifill probably won't do that, and it's probably not even a good idea to do that, because it will be \"condescending.\" And even \"sexist.\" So we are then confronted with a situation in which we have three candidates who quite clearly know a great deal about American governance and history \u2013 just like every nearly other candidate in recent history, with the semi-exception of George Bush and the very likely exception of Dan Quayle \u2013 and one who knows next to nothing about these things and who by all appearances has never cracked open a book of history in her life. </p> <p>And yet we cannot discuss that openly and frankly, at least on television, because to do so only provides evidence of the crimes of condescension etc that I listed above.</p> <p>And now, even as some conservatives have urged her to remove herself from the ticket, we've simultaneously entered a \"Sorry for Sarah\" phase. Judith Warner offered <a href=\"http://warner.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/25/poor-sarah/?em\">a silly example of the genre</a> in her New York Times column: </p> <blockquote> <p>I'll bet you anything that her admirers \u2013 the ones whose hearts really and truly swell with a sense of kinship to her \u2013 see or sense it in her, too. They know she can't possibly do it all \u2013 the kids, the special-needs baby, the big job, the big conversations with foreign leaders. And neither could they.</p> </blockquote> <p>Uh, Judith. No, they could not. And that's completely fine, because they shouldn't be a heartbeat away from the presidency anymore than Palin should. Gosh, First Dude, can you drive the kids to soccer practice? John is just insisting that I learn about this Kashmir place today. I know, I thought it was kinda neat that it was more than the name of a Zeppelin song, too!</p> <p>Every so often, a writer happens to be firing on all cylinders and lays waste to an argument that is a waste of our time. Rebecca Traister has done us this service in Salon. <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/mwt/feature/2008/09/30/palin_pity/index1.html\">It's must reading</a>. A small taste:</p> <blockquote> <p>Sarah Palin is no wilting flower. She is a politician who took the national stage and sneered at the work of community activists. She boldly tries to pass off incuriosity and lassitude as regular-people qualities, thereby doing a disservice to all those Americans who also work two jobs and do not come from families that hand out passports and backpacking trips, yet still manage to pick up a paper and read about their government and seek out experience and knowledge. </p> </blockquote> <p>Expectations for her performance on Thursday are so low that she may well stumble through. Ifill and Joe Biden will both have to be deft. We all have to go through this charade of pretending that the obvious isn't true. The threat is that the charade may overpower the truth. But even if it does, the truth will still be the truth, and the truth is that she does not belong anywhere near national leadership.</p>",
  "<p>In 2008, 3.5 million newly <a href=\"http://www.nextgov.com/nextgov/ng_20080925_7010.php\">registered voters </a>many of them minority and young voters energized by the Obama campaign, promise to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/21/us/21voting.html?_r=1&amp;bl&amp;ex=1216785600&amp;en=64c9c3848c52667d&amp;ei=5087%250A&amp;oref=slogin\">strain the system</a> with long lines and overburdened voting machines. Since these new voters could tip the scales against McCain in several key states, the GOP is already employing some bizarre tactics to further suppress their participation. A few examples:</p> <p>\u2022 Taking advantage of the economic crisis, the chair of the Republican Party in Macomb County, in the battleground state of Michigan, has plans to use a list of <a href=\"http://michiganmessenger.com/4076/lose-your-house-lose-your-vote\">foreclosed homes</a> to question the eligibility of voters, many of them low-income, minority, Democratic voters. Since they can be challenged if they are not \"true residents of the city or township\" in which they try to vote, \"We will have a list of foreclosed homes and will make sure people aren't voting from those addresses,\" the GOP chair told the Michigan Messenger. (A law firm specializing in foreclosures houses McCain's regional headquarters, and its founder has contributed more than $100,000 to McCain's campaign.) Republicans may also raise <a href=\"http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/local_news/stories/2008/07/06/vacant.ART_ART_07-06-08_A1_5UAL914.html?sid=101\">foreclosure-based challenges</a> in Ohio and a host of other cities and states.</p> <p>\u2022 Last week, a House committee held hearings on widespread <a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/articles/news/campaign-2008/2008/09/24/confusing-voter-registration-laws-could-affect-presidential-election.html\">discrimination against student voters</a> who have registered in droves, a majority of them to support Obama. Efforts to discourage the youth vote have focused on the fact that many college students have two places of residence (school and their parents' home). One registrar in the county that is home to Virginia Tech warned new student voters that they could lose their insurance and scholarships if they registered using their school addresses (something that has never happened). Students at Colorado College received similar warnings, and in Michigan, the <a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/articles/news/national/2008/09/18/aclu-sues-michigan-over-voter-purge-program-saying-it-hurts-college-students.html\">ACLU has sued </a> to prevent the cancellation of voter registrations for individuals who get a driver's license in another state. </p> <p>\u2022 Florida election officials have received dozens of calls from registered Democrats in the state, worried that there may be a problem with their voter registration. <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=94818483\">They had all received </a>an official looking \"Party Affiliation Voter Registration Card\" from the McCain campaign, listing their name, district, and something called a \"voter ID number\" and identifying their party affiliation as Republican. Mailings meant to mislead or discourage voters are nothing new: In Ohio's crucial 2004 vote, some minority urban voters received <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122125136545029511.html?mod=googlenews_wsj\">fake voter bulletins </a> that told Republicans to vote on Tuesday and Democrats to vote on Wednesday.</p> <p>\u2022 For years, while Democrats complained of vote suppression, Republicans have countered with accusations of voter fraud, claiming that fake people, dead people, non-citizens, non-residents, and criminals are trying to vote. This largely mythological claim has nonetheless been effective in bringing about new barriers to voting in the name of preventing fraud. Just this year, the Supreme Court upheld an Indiana law that imposes strict photo ID requirements for voting. The law will disproportionately affect those least likely to have drivers' licenses, including the young and the elderly, poor people, minorities, and legal immigrants. In the Indiana primary in May, a <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2008/may/07/nation/na-voterid7\">dozen nuns</a> in their eighties and nineties were turned away from the polls because they did not have valid photo identification.</p>",

Narratives that were meant to inspire and empower us with their messages of triumph over adversity serve instead as fodder for our most voyeuristic tendencies; it's starting to feel like there's an incredibly tasteless <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xe1a1wHxTyo&amp;feature=related\">competition</a> on to find the poor sod who has had the most <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Cry-Silent-Tears-Horrific-Childhood/dp/0007274041/ref=pd_sxp_f_pt\">miserable childhood in the history of the world, ever</a>.</p> <p>But as Libby Brooks observed recently in her <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/17/ukcrime.internationalcrime\">excellent piece</a> on the debate about rape: \"Creating a hierarchy of victimhood helps no one.\" I couldn't agree more.</p> <p>Even those with all the advantages aren't exempt from all this wallowing and internal reflection. <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/boarding-school-is-a-form-of-child-abuse-says-psychotherapist-673456.html\">Born with a silver spoon in your mouth and sent to all the best schools</a>? Don't worry, there's a support group out there for you somewhere. Think you've always been happy and never wanted for anything? Well think again. No one gets through life unscathed: you're probably in denial and need a good dose of therapy to find out whatever it is you're repressing.</p> <p>The recent furore over <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jun/28/discriminationatwork.gender\">Harriet Harman's equality bill</a> proposals was a perfect illustration of how even the most privileged among us are now getting in on the act. Threatened with having to compete against women and ethnic minorities for jobs they would normally regard as theirs by right, some men have, ever since the bill was announced, been squealing louder than stuck pigs. \"It's not fair!\" they complain as they watch their unearned privileges ebbing away, \"I'm being discriminated against! Now I'm a victim too.\"</p> <p>Really? Then welcome to the club. It's getting a bit crowded in here isn't it?</p> <p>What's really lacking in all of this introspection is any sense of the bigger picture; all political perspective seems to have been lost. These personal histories stand alone, testament to the individualism that has permeated every aspect of 21st-century life. Rather than examining and critiquing our social conditions, we're encouraged instead to look inwards, to heal ourselves and rid ourselves of any demons we may have picked up along the way. As a consequence of this we're failing to make those vital connections between our personal experiences and how our lives have been shaped by forces beyond our individual control.</p> <p>But \"the personal is political\" was not just some trite feminist slogan dreamed up to help bored housewives make sense of their lot. As Carol Hanisch said in her <a href=\"http://scholar.alexanderstreet.com/download/attachments/2259/Personal+Is+Pol.pdf?version=\" 1\" 1969\">essay (pdf)</a> of the same name: \"personal problems are political problems. There are no personal solutions at this time. There is only collective action for a collective solution.\" Isn't it about time we started to embrace that kind of thinking again?</p> <p>The discriminations and prejudices I've encountered in my life are not because I'm me, Cath Elliott: they're a direct result of the gender and social class I was born into. Counselling, self-help books or holistic therapies might make me better able to deal with what life has thrown or has yet to throw at me, but it won't do anything to change the external conditions that impact negatively on me and mine. </p> <p>As Elayne Rapping says in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Culture-Recovery-Making-Self-help-Movement/dp/0807027162\">The Culture of Recovery</a>: \"By itself, therapy can only do so much in a world in which material conditions and differences do indeed have an impact on consciousness and emotional experience. One can \"get one's life in order\" as best one can, through therapy, self-help, and so on. But that life will still be lived in a context of social reality which therapy, alone, does not address, except indirectly. More, and different, activities are needed.\"</p> <p>So, the choice is ours. We can either continue to wallow in our victimhood, fighting to outdo each other with our tales of oppression and woe, and attempting to <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/You-Can-Heal-Your-Life/dp/0937611018/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1222442977&amp;sr=8-1\">heal our lives</a> in splendid isolation, or we can learn once again to recognise our shared experiences and start to fight together for change. We're only victims if we choose to be so. Personally I reject the label: I'd advise everyone else to do the same.</p>",

  "<p>Last month the Republican convention was almost swept away by a hurricane that never happened. This week the Conservative conference has been overshadowed by a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/marketturmoil\">hurricane</a> that only seems to be gathering in strength.</p> <p>It is hard to think of a phrase that does not seem trite to sum up the huge amount of concern and worry that is affecting people in America and Europe. Most people, if they are honest, do not know how or when it might end. Policymakers and politicians are playing catch up.</p> <p>David Cameron has just given a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/30/toryconference.conservatives4\">short address</a> to the Conservative party conference. It was an opportunity for him to spell out what, if anything, the opposition can do to try and steer the ship through these stormy waters. Cameron's speech was short and succinct. He made it clear that the Conservatives will help the government to pass any realistic and practical legislation that can help now and in the future. This includes a bill to help the regulatory authorities intervene earlier in a banking crisis. We have dropped our opposition to one technical point, in order to speed the legislation through. Cameron has also urged the government to bring forward legislation to protect depositors, providing much needed reassurance and stability.</p> <p>This crisis cannot be waved away or solved overnight. But politicians, who will take their share of the blame, can now step up to the plate. They must show, as I think Cameron is showing, that they will be calm in a crisis. They must show that they can see the wood for the trees. The gross negligence that has occurred does not mean the end of capitalism of the end of our financial services. It was good to see Cameron defend the fundamentals of a market economy, after last week's lurch to the left by Labour. Above all, the government must do what Cameron has done \u2013 put aside party politics, and work together for the good of the country.</p>",
  "<p>The blaze that caused \u00a310m of damage to the Cutty Sark last year was sparked by an industrial vacuum cleaner on the ship, police said today.</p> <p>The machine was being used to remove waste during restoration work on the <a href=\"http://www.cuttysark.org.uk/index.cfm\">historic tea clipper</a> when the fire broke out in May.</p> <p>Officials found that the equipment had been left running for a weekend before the fire broke out during the early hours of a Monday morning.</p> <p>Nick Carey, of the London Fire Brigade, said the industrial vacuum cleaner had been used by workmen because it was equipped with a thermal cutout to prevent overheating.</p> <p>However, investigators found that the Italian machine did not have the switch because it had been adapted to run on the lower power voltage used on UK building sites.</p> <p>Carey said tests on an identical vacuum cleaner revealed that it caught fire if the plastic inlet hose became blocked.</p> <p>Investigators condemned \"dangerous work practices\" by renovators and the failure of security staff to notice the blaze.</p> <p>However, they stopped short of saying that the devastation could have been averted had the alarm been raised earlier.</p> <p>Physical evidence and CCTV footage revealed that the fire began on the lower deck towards the stern of the ship, which is kept in a dry dock in Greenwich, south-east London.</p> <p>The investigation was conducted by Metropolitan police detectives, who worked alongside the London Fire Brigade and forensic experts.</p> <p>Detective Chief Inspector Dave Garwood, who led the inquiry, said two security guards had failed to observe the fire immediately and had subsequently made a \"clumsy\" attempt to hide a false logbook entry.</p> <p>He said a page claiming that routine patrols had been completed until 7am, two hours after the blaze broke out, was found in a bin.</p> <p>Garwood said the guards - who have been sacked - may not have been able to stop the fire but could have reported it more quickly.</p> <p>A project manager told investigators that guards had been found asleep, or absent from the site, on previous occasions.</p> <p>Garwood said renovation workers were responsible for dangerous practices on board the ship.</p> <p>He added that electrical equipment was often left plugged in, debris was not removed immediately and there were loose electrical connections.</p> <p>The deputy chief inspector reported that it was unclear whether fire alarm tests had been completed properly in the weeks before the blaze and said a fire marshal had not checked the ship before it was left for the weekend.</p> <p>\"We believe that the lack of this fire check on Friday, May 18, was a significant factor in the fire,\" he added. \"It was a missed opportunity.\"</p> <p>More than 40 firefighters <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/may/22/topstories3.artnews\">tackled the blaze</a>, which began shortly before 5am on May 21.</p> <p>Flames engulfed the 138-year-old tea clipper, once the fastest of its type, causing serious damage.</p> <p>The fire burned through each of its three decks, destroying all the building work structures and tools on board.</p> <p>The damage added \u00a310m to the cost of the ongoing conservation project, bringing the total cost of the work to \u00a335m.

  "<p>A British couple whose three-month-old daughter was taken into care because of a \"misguided\" suspicion of abuse, were today awarded \u00a38,000 by the European court of human rights.</p> <p>The Strasbourg court rejected the claim of the unnamed Oldham couple that the removal of the baby breached their human rights, ruling that social and medical authorities had a \"genuine and reasonably-held concern\" about the child's welfare.</p> <p>But the fact that the couple had no way to challenge the correctness of the local authority's decision and to claim compensation meant the government had breached the human rights convention, the court ruled.</p> <p>The couple, named only as RK, 36, and his 32-year-old wife, are British nationals, whose daughter, M, was born in July 1998. Three months after the birth, M was taken to hospital with a fractured femur.</p> <p>Doctors decided the injury was not the result of an accident and M was placed in the care of her aunt.</p> <p>But when the baby then suffered another bone fracture a second medical check diagnosed brittle bone disease. M was returned to her home and parents in April 1999.</p> <p>The couple claimed in court that the child's removal on the basis of a medical misdiagnosis breached a human rights requirement on governments to protect the \"right to respect for private and family life\".</p> <p>They also claimed their \"right to an effective remedy\" had been breached.</p> <p>In today's judgement, the ECHR said that there was no dispute that the interim care order had interfered with the couple's right to respect for their family life. But it said that the interference had been \"in accordance with the law\" and pursued the legitimate aim of protecting M.</p> <p>\"Indeed, the authorities, medical and social, had a duty to protect children and could not be held liable every time genuine and reasonably held concerns about the safety of children in their families were proved, retrospectively, to have been misguided,\" the judges said.</p> <p>They described brittle bone disease as \"a very rare and difficult condition to identify in small infants\".</p> <p>The judges decided that the actions of the authorities \"had been proportionate in the circumstances and had given due and timely account to the applicants' interests\".</p> <p>But they said: \"The applicants should have had available to them a means to claim that the local authority's handling of procedures had been responsible for any damage they had suffered and to claim compensation.\"</p> <p>The parents were awarded \u00a38,000 for violation of the right to an effective remedy, plus \u00a314,000 for legal costs and expenses.</p>",
  "<p>In <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/britain/exhibitions/artnow/artnowlivesept07/gilligan.shtm\">Melanie Gilligan's</a> Artangel film <a href=\"http://www.crisisinthecreditsystem.org.uk\">Crisis in the Credit System</a>, a role-play session by a group of city high-flyers at a country house hotel turns into a nightmare vision of capitalism out of control.</p> <p>Except it ain't no nightmare - some of the darkest images the film conjures up now look like reportage, as the crisis spirals beyond where it was at when this eerily diverting number was produced.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/iWdFzEqlwBo?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <object width=\"425\" height=\"344\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/iWdFzEqlwBo&hl=en&fs=1\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><embed src=\"https://www.youtube.com/v/iWdFzEqlwBo&hl=en&fs=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\"></embed></object> </figure>   <p>But I can't help thinking there is a disturbing analogy between the credit culture that has come crashing to a halt and the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2008/sep/16/damienhirst.art1\">inflation of reputations in contemporary art</a>. As we enter another London autumn with another wave of the latest geniuses, maybe some controls need to be brought in to prevent a similar failure of credit undermining the art world.</p> <p>A massive delusion grips the London art scene and the media that celebrate it: this takes two forms -</p> <p>(a) There about 100 geniuses currently working in London. This is the older version of the myth, dating back to the Young British Art era of the 1990s. In this fantasy, a huge number of individual artists ranging from Marc Quinn to Grayson Perry are formidably gifted and important. The sheer number of such names beggars belief and cannot be real - it's obvious that many of these people must be lesser artists, by far, than we want them to be, otherwise London would now be the greatest cultural capital in world history. After all, Paris in 1907 or Athens in the 5th century BC could only boast a handful of great artists.</p> <p>(b) In the more sophisticated - or sophistical - version of the dream, there are no geniuses in London right now, but genius doesn't matter.</p> <p>Even talent is a corny word. What's great is that so many young people find art to be a useful language and there's so much activity. Some of it's fantastic, some of it less so, but the buzz is tremendous. This fiction has extended the credit in the system enormously - the supply of convincing new stars ran out some time ago but the notion that this isn't about stars, it's about the work, and the quantity rather than ultimate quality thereof, has given the system new bounce. But it's just nonsense to say artistic quality doesn't matter or to refuse any test that judges today's art against serious criteria.</p> <p>The credit boom in art is far from over. It will go on - until it ends. But current events are proving that everything ends: even capitalism. Melanie Gilligan's film is thought provoking - but mostly it made me think about the follies of an art system that doesn't add up.</p>",
  "<p>Times of international crises can be intensely frustrating for opposition parties, particularly when outside events clash with their annual conference.<br><br>David Cameron had three options today after the US House of Representatives voted down Hank Paulson's toxic loan plan:</p> <p>1. Do nothing and carry on with the conference as normal on the grounds that Republican congressmen and women are unlikely to change their votes after an intervention by the leader of Britain's main opposition party.</p> <p>2. Shout from the rooftops what the Tories think in private - that the two countries with the most important financial centres in the western world (the US and the UK) are now crippled by poor leadership.</p> <p>3. Try to appear statesmanlike and offer constructive help in a difficult time.</p> <p>Cameron wisely chose the third option and guaranteed himself at least a mention on the lunchtime news bulletins when he offered Conservative help with any emergency legislation that may be needed.</p> <p>In a spirit of bipartisanship he offered to drop one of the Tories' main objections to the handling of bank crises. The Tories will drop their call that the Bank of England, rather than the Financial Services Authority, should \"pull the trigger\" on failing banks.</p> <p>Cameron hopes his offer will either be helpful - or make Gordon Brown look partisan if he spurns Tory help.</p> <p>But Cameron has to be careful not to lay on his statesmanship too thick. At one point he gravely intoned that Britain could not allow a repeat of the events in the US in which the legislature threw out a plan from the executive. That, of course, is unlikely to happen in Britain because we did not have founding fathers who decided to separate these principal branches of government.</p> <p>Brown enjoys a historically large Commons majority and may be tempted to tell the Tories that their bipartisanship has arrived a little late. Until Sunday Cameron was still railing against the nationalisation of Northern Rock and Bradford &amp; Bingley, a position originally designed last year for political reasons to embarrass Brown when he bowed to the inevitable and took Northern Rock into \"temporary public ownership\".</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/19/labour.labourconference1\">Keir Hardie</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2008/sep/29/toryconference.conservatives2\">Margaret Thatcher</a> certainly make an odd couple. It is hard to imagine how they might get on with one another, or where the utterly inevitable argument that would take place between them would reach boiling point. Yet the two do now have one thing in common. Each has been chosen, in the past 10 days, as their respective party's greatest hero. For those who bemoan the fact that Britain's political parties have converged into one mushy centrist consensus, the choices of Hardie and Thatcher come as a bracing vindication of the sense that party politics remains deeply tribal.</p> <p>A word of background. Every year, at each of the party conferences, several newspapers and media outlets, with the Guardian well to the fore, host their own fringe meetings. It has to be confessed that most of these meetings \u2013 my memory tells me the practice began about 20 years ago \u2013 have now become pretty similar in form. Three or four luminaries from the appropriate party sit or a stage and debate a predictable and very generalised motion. Whither the Liberal Democrats \u2013 or Labour, or the Tories? Or variations on that theme. Sometimes someone stands up and says something reportable, but most of the time not.</p> <p>This year, we decided to change the Guardian event. Instead of the usual general chunter about the state of the world, we organised a poll to find the greatest hero of each of the two main parties. The only reason we didn't do this with the Lib Dems is that we pinched the idea from them; in 2007 the Lib Dem history group organised its own contest, electing <a href=\"http://www.liberalhistory.org.uk/item_single.php?item_id=33&amp;item=biography\">John Stuart Mill</a> as the greatest Liberal of all time. We thought that equivalent exercises for Labour and the Tories would refresh the annual fringe event \u2013 and might even be enjoyable occasions too. As it turned out, we were right.</p> <p>There was, I confess, an ulterior motive. As well as aiming to please the respective audiences, we hoped we might get a story out of it. When, earlier this summer, we asked Labour and Tory MPs to choose four names to be debated from a shortlist of around 20, my private hope was that Labour MPs would put Tony Blair into the final four, so that the debate and vote at the Labour conference would have a bit of contemporary spice. Likewise I wanted the Tory MPs to put Thatcher in the last four. That too would have give the Tory conference event a bit of edge.</p> <p>In the event, I got one out of my two wishes. Frustratingly, Labour MPs put Blair fifth on the list, behind Hardie, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/19/labour.labourconference\">Clement Attlee</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/19/labour.labourconference2\">Nye Bevan</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/19/labourconference.labour\">Barbara Castle</a>. More predictably, the Tory MPs put Thatcher straight into the run-off, along with Edmund Burke, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/30/conservatives.toryconference\">Benjamin Disraeli</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/26/conservatives.past\">Winston Churchill</a>. Last week at Manchester, a large audience on the Labour fringe overwhelmingly chose Hardie (the MPs had put Attlee top). Last night in Birmingham, an equally large audience emphatically gave the Tory palm to Thatcher.</p> <p>It would be hard to argue that Thatcher should not be in the final four, as John Whittingdale, making the case for his former boss, made clear:</p> <p>But there is also a case against her, even in Tory terms, which Kenneth Baker, arguing for Churchill last night, articulated:</p> <p>But it was a terrific session \u2013 as the Labour session in Manchester also was last week. Whittingdale told an excellent anecdote about Thatcher's total lack of sense of humour:</p> <p>While Michael Gove managed by sheer cleverness and wit to almost hoist Burke into second place in front of Churchill:</p> <p>What, if anything, do these two final choices tell us? I think they say something significant in both cases. Offered a choice between a path-breaking ethical visionary and three political leaders with a variety of very substantive achievements to their names (Attlee \u2013 freedom for India, Bevan \u2013 the NHS, Castle \u2013 equal pay for women), Labour delegates delivered a landslide for the ancient visionary. At the risk of oversimplifying absurdly, I think this shows that most Labour activists are happiest feeling good about themselves as individuals rather than actually doing things for others.</p> <p>The Tories are the precise opposite. Offered a choice between an apostle of caution, a unifying cynic, the saviour of the country and the most divisive politician in modern British history, their choice was almost as conclusively in favour of the modern warrior Thatcher as Labour's was for Hardie. If Labour activists like comfort, the Tory activists just as clearly fancy a fight.</p> <p>Does this illuminate anything about our politics? I think it does. Basically Labour doesn't mind losing whereas for the Tories winning is what matters. Looking around the party battlefield right now, I think that gets it about right.</p>",
  "<p>\"There's a slight air of unreality about it all,\" the BBC's Evan Davis gently suggested to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/30/davidcameron.creditcrunch\">David Cameron</a> when they discussed the deepening economic crisis and the Tory conference on the radio this morning. </p> <p>Cameron's unscheduled intervention on the conference podium underlines how much is at stake for the Tories too.</p> <p>For the party of free markets and deregulation the terms of trade are changing fast and Cameron's team are running hard to catch up with the pace of events and distance themselves from where they were until quite recently. But at least they're trying.</p> <p>Among party activists in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/toryconference\">Birmingham</a>, in the corridors, bars and receptions plenty of representatives \u2013 never delegates \u2013 are still with the Republican obstructionists in the US Congress \u2013 convinced that government interventions across the world are preventing the self-correction which unfettered markets would deliver unaided to the stricken banking system.</p> <p>\"We shouldn't be bailing out the banks, let them pay for their own mistakes,\" a self-styled fundraiser for the party, living in a rich corner of London, told me at the Spectator party last night. \"We're way past that stage now,\" I ventured.</p> <p>A few feet closer to the exit I encountered another woman, also 30-ish, who was vague about what she does for a living (banker?) but agreed with me. \"There's an enormous truck bearing down on us all,\" she said. \"People haven't got it yet.\"</p> <p>Agreed on that, I don't think I've quite got it yet either. But I'm going through all my financial affairs in my head in spare moments, starting to think \"can I afford that any more?\" You probably are too. If not, get started.</p> <p>I thought <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/politics/georgeosborne\">George Osborne</a> rose to the occasion well enough in his speech to the conference yesterday. Yes, there was plenty in it to criticise, as the <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/30/wallstreet.marketturmoil1\">Guardian's leader</a> suggests today. </p> <p>\"The cupboard is bare,\" as he said. But the conference juggernaut is still making spending pledges and Osborne himself promised a council tax freeze \u2013 the biggest applause line of the day, incidentally.</p> <p>He managed to get rid of his teenage smirk, the one he usually lets slips every time he delivers a good zinger, and sounded both serious, scornful \u2013 of Gordon Brown and the City \u2013 as well as suitably austere. There was a touch of Iain Macleod, the Tory highbrow, professional gambler and bridge player, darling of the party left, who died at No 11 three weeks after becoming chancellor in 1970.</p> <p>Macleod was a fine orator and when Osborne inverted the prime minister's novice joke I thought of him. Did you catch it? \"Well, Mr Brown, when it comes to listening, learning and understanding, you know I believe in apprenticeships. But this is no time for a novice.\"</p> <p>All that said, Brown and Alistair Darling are now looking as if they are on top of events much more than they did as Northern Rock shattered this time last year. The Bradford &amp; Bingley collapse was much better handled, so far as I can yet see. </p> <p>And which governing party presided over deregulation and the demutualisation of solid, unflashy building societies? Labour was carried along by the tide, further than it should have been, but Margaret Thatcher \u2013 voted the party's greatest hero in last night's Guardian conference debate - put it all in train.</p> <p>That may be why hardcore Republican congressmen wrecked the Paulson plan as semi-socialist and why Barack Obama seems \u2013 seems - to be pulling ahead again in the presidential race. They don't get the need to stop the rot, stop the collapse of financial institutions around the world, which are basically sound and should not fall. It's all about confidence.</p> <p>But then, the US Congress failed most of its major tests in the 20th century: the League of Nations (1919-20); the Wall St slump of 1929-31; collective security before Pearl Harbour (1941); Vietnam (1963-75) and the debt-crazed, tax-slashing deregulation of the past 20 years. </p> <p>Neither party comes out well, but the Republicans, pandering to the dafter prejudices of public opinion, comes out worse. Why change the bad habits of one century just because a new one rolls up?</p> <p>The most sombre conversation I heard last night was between half a dozen senior Tories, ex-ministers, even a former cabinet minister. They too thought it is now getting very serious, very fast. </p> <p>\"When we get into power we will have to cut public spending sharply as Margaret Thatcher did in 1979,\" said one. \" Does David Cameron have the nerve to do it. Have he and George Osborne got it yet?\" </p> <p>\"And will Labour poison the well? Will Brown spend and spend, knowing he's going to lose. All that stuff about free childcare for two-year-olds, he knows he can't do it now,\" said another.</p> <p>Scary talk. Meanwhile, in distant Austria the far right has just taken 29% of the vote. Tin helmets on.</p> <p><strong>11.45am footnote:</strong> Cameron has just addressed the conference, implicitly confirming last night's rumours that they thought of cancelling the remaining stages by bringing his closing speech forward by 24 hours to this morning.</p> <p>Instead, still struggling to catch up with events, he made a short holding statement which contained two key points. </p> <p>One was telling his party activists that, despite widespread anger with the financial sector, today is not the \"day of reckoning.\" Today is the day for ensuring safety, security and the protection for the jobs and savings of ordinary citizens, put at risk by the meltdown. </p> <p>\"We must not bury the free enterprise system, but reform it, he said. Tory instincts are sound here because Tories understand the system - \"We understand its strengths and its weaknesses.\" That's a further attempt to put distance between the party and its past.</p> <p>Cleverly I thought, Cameron also extended a bipartisan hand to the government \u2013 \"let us not allow the political wrangling that took place in America to happen here in our own country.\" Prolonged applause.</p> <p>In practical terms he wants a tightening of bank regulation (who should have the power, the Bank of England, as he wishes, or the FSA ?); legislation, also next week, to strengthen protection of savings; and a global effort to tweak the \"making to market\" mechanism which is now driving down credit worthiness in a destructive way.</p> <p>All fair enough, and the devil is in the detail. But it struck me as a well-judged intervention.</p>",

  "<p>At last, it is official. The Indian home ministry, speaking on behalf of the federal government declared last week that it would \"violently oppose\" any plea to decriminalise homosexuality in the country. Calling it a <a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Homosexuality_a_reflection_of_perverse_mind_Centre/articleshow/3530854.cms\">\"moral perversion\", and \"a social vice\"</a> that needs to be contained, the ministry suggested that Indian society's strong and overwhelming disapproval of homosexuality was reason enough to treat it as a criminal offence.</p> <p>This was all a bit odd, as the health ministry, also a part of the federal government, <a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Health_Minister_Ramadoss_for_legalising_homosexuality/articleshow/3342815.cms\">took quite the opposite position</a>, supporting the plea filed by over 30 voluntary organisations to \"read down\" the 150-year old anti-gay law, which, by criminalising anything outside heterosexual vaginal intercourse, carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.indianexpress.com/news/gay-ban-court-makes-moralist-govt-squirm/366528/1\">The Delhi high court seemed sympathetic</a>, and censured the government severely for its indifferent attitude to the case and for speaking in two voices.</p> <p>But why should the government take such a step after all? First, sexuality is a taboo in India \u2013 and has been for centuries, despite academic beliefs otherwise. Public displays of affection, even between members of the opposite sex, are considered deeply offensive. At least 11 states have independently banned sex education in schools on moral grounds, despite the fact that India has one of the highest rates of HIV infection in the world among young people.</p> <p>Second, homosexuality is indeed held in deep contempt by a vast majority of Indians. Most men who are aware of their sexual orientation prefer to keep it a secret, for fear of social ostracisation. Besides, having an anti-gay law doesn't help. The law is used almost on a daily basis by the police to commit institutional abuse \u2013 in the form of blackmail, extortion, harassment, and even rape or murder \u2013 although <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/english/docs/2006/01/11/india12398.htm\">such incidents</a> mostly go unreported. </p> <p>Third, and this is probably the most important reason, politicians fear that supporting gay rights could prove political suicide. Such fears are not necessarily unfounded. With rare exceptions in the national press and television, portrayal of gay men and women by the sensationalist Indian media has been hopelessly and stereotypically negative, often equating homosexuality with paedophilia and bestiality \u2013 views likely to be shared by the voting population.</p> <p>Having said all this, an increasing number of gay men and women refuse to be treated as criminals because of their sexuality. Indeed, recognising this, the Delhi high court went so far as to make helpful comparisons between the dehumanising effects of the current law and those of caste-based discrimination. </p> <p>The possibility therefore exists that the court may end up ruling in favour of decriminalising homosexuality. If so, a bitter legal battle is then likely to commence between gay rights activists and the government \u2013 one that will be played through the supreme court, and in the full glare of the hungry media.</p> <p>And that is not necessarily helpful. Indeed, should there be any indications that consensual gay sex would be legalised, it is likely that there will be a flurry of legislations that are blatantly anti-gay, and likely to appeal to the voting public. </p> <p>For example, same-sex marriage and adoption, and any accompanying benefits, hitherto unlegislated, could be outlawed. Laws similar to Section 28 may be introduced. And it will certainly take a very long time before gay men and women have any semblance of equality with their heterosexual counterparts. </p> <p>The key to gay rights in India lies not just in legislation, but in educating an overwhelmingly conservative public, and raising awareness about the normalcy of sexual plurality and the need for tolerance and acceptance. And that will take time and effort. </p> <p>Unfortunately, where even gay rights groups often struggle with ideological differences, few people in India seem to care enough to make that effort.</p>",
  "<p>And the best Canadian album of the past twelve months is? An album written and recorded by a man, with a British passport, in his Islington bedroom. </p> <p>British-Canadian Dan Snaith - the electronic eccentric known as <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/cariboumanitoba\">Caribou</a> - won the CA$20,000 (\u00a310,600) <a href=\"http://www.polarismusicprize.ca/\">Polaris Music Prize</a> last night for his 2007 album <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/aug/19/worldmusic.jazz\">Andorra</a>. The dual citizen originally hails from London, Ontario, but he moved to the other London about seven years ago to complete his PhD in Mathematics at <a href=\"http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/\">Imperial College</a>.</p> <p>Now in its third year, the Polaris Prize is Canada's attempted answer to Britain's Mercury Prize. That would make the choice of Caribou roughly equivalent to 2005 Mercury winner Antony and the Johnsons, who was famously <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4221256.stm\">assailed for living a transatlantic existence</a>.</p> <p>Or at least it would, if there anyone was remotely raising a fuss. This is Canada, however, so there were no sour grapes on display from the <a href=\"http://canadianpress.google.com/article/ALeqM5giV89_-epMu3oPQwe2ymVsaFZYuA\">nine runners-up</a> at the Phoenix in Toronto last night. (How could you argue that a one-man band called Caribou - the adorably antlered animal that <a href=\"http://www.wildernesscommittee.org/campaigns/wildlife/caribou/reports/Vol24No04\">adorns our 25-cent coins</a> - is not Canadian enough?)</p> <p>Unlike the Mercury, the Polaris just doesn't seem capable of controversy. That allows for the focus to remain firmly on the <a href=\"http://www.polarismusicprize.ca/nominees/\">quality of the nominated albums</a>, sure, but, on the other hand, it makes it a bit dull. Imagine the Mercury if a band like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/audio/2008/sep/10/jonze.elbow\">Elbow won</a> every single year. Where's the fun, if there aren't a few WTF decisions like M People once in a while?</p> <p>The Polaris jury decides on the final winner out of the ten short-listed candidates by secret ballot rather than a Mercury-style consensus. Ex-jury member Mike Doherty recently told all about the behind-the-scenes non-battle that led to Montreal's Patrick Watson being selected last year. \"I looked forward to volatile arguments punctuated by fists hitting tables and speeches that would grow increasingly fervid as the open bar loosened tongues and the nominees performed out of earshot in the concert hall,\" he <a href=\"http://www.nationalpost.com/arts/story.html?id=846369\">revealed in the National Post yesterday</a>. \"Instead, our subdued, sober group politely agreed to disagree.\"</p> <p>Caribou - after Watson and, 2006's inaugural Polaris winner, string king Owen Pallet aka Final Fantasy - is another lovely, uncontroversial pick. Andorra is widely regarded as Snaith's most satisfying work. In The Observer Music Monthly, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/aug/12/popandrock.shopping6\">Ben Thompson wrote</a>: \"Shrugging off its painful titular association with English footballing underachievement, Andorra conjures up a magical realm somewhere between the Who at their spaciest and My Bloody Valentine at their most connected.\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/nov/20/2\">This here website's Rosie Swash called</a> choice cut She's the One \"a glorious and unassuming pop classic.\"</p> <p>Unassuming is certainly the word for Snaith, who was nearly literally speechless upon winning the award. \"If I seem completely overwhelmed I apologise,\" he said. \"It's because I totally am.\" Asked what he was going to do with the money, he disappointed the gathered journos on deadline by saying to check back with him in a few days once he had given it serious thought.</p> <p>Snaith's polite dorkiness was mirrored by the overall proceedings. Technical glitches gave the Polaris ceremony - broadcast live on <a href=\"http://radio3.cbc.ca/\">CBC Radio 3</a> - an unpolished feel, as did the decision to include awkward print journalists as presenters. (One unfolded his introduction on a crumpled piece of paper and read it in a monotone.)</p> <p>But if the trappings were a bit cringeworthy, the musical performances weren't. Caribou beat out fine albums from artists with international followings like London (Ontario) singer-songwriter <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/jun/05/folk.popandrock\">Basia Bulat</a>, Montreal's electro-pop outfit <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/jan/31/popandrock\">Stars</a>, and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/jun/16/popandrock.alexispetridis\">eye-rollingly named</a> but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/aug/25/holy.fuck.reading\">eye-poppingly brilliant</a> electronica act Holy Fuck, as well as less transatlantic artists as alt-country crooner Kathleen Edwards, Prairie-ana peddlers The Weakerthans and Common-influenced progressive emcee <a href=\"http://news.guelphmercury.com/arts/article/382278\">Shad</a>.</p> <p>The evening was proof that Canada's indie scene continues to thrive. One only had to look at the albums that didn't make the shortlist - <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/mar/07/popandrock.neilyoung\">Neil Young</a>'s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/oct/12/popandrock.shopping\">Chrome Dreams II</a>, The New Pornographers' <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/aug/17/popandrock.shopping\">Challengers</a>, Tegan and Sara's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/feb/17/popandrock.features13\">The Con</a> - to see that it was a strong year even without a release by an Arcade Fire, Feist or Broken Social Scene.</p> <p>My only worry is that, if the Polaris is designed to boost the profile of the nominated acts, it won't do that if people start to get bored and tune it out. A love-'em-or-hate-'em band like the Klaxons can actually win the Mercury, but a similarly controversial disc like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/aug/25/crystal.castles\">Crystal Castles</a>' self-titled debut apparently can't even land a slot on the shortlist. Caribou's Andorra was a fine, safe choice for the Polaris - but is it too much to ask for the occasional dramatic one?</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Preamble</strong></p> <p>The visitors go into tonight's match on the back of a Sir Alex Ferguson hissy-fit, thrown yesterday when the Manchester United manager told hacks he would never co-operate with them again. Quite how how the gentlemen of the fourth estate will cope without being bullied, belittled or glowered at by Fergie on a weekly basis is anyone's guess. </p> <p>Whether Ferguson will be able to get by without the weekly ego-boost provided by a room-full of obsequious sausage-roll junkies braying far too loudly at his unfunny quips also remains equally open to question. It's also worth noting that, at the time of writing, he had yet to confirm who will aid and abet him in his attempts to wind up other managers in the build-up to big matches now that he'll no longer relying on the press to do so.</p> <p>Away from all that guff and nonsense, tonight's encounter at the 10,000-seater Aalborg Stadium is Superligaen champions AaB's first meeting with United. Managed by itinerant former Arsenal, Middlesbrough and Bolton manager Bruce Rioch, AaB <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/sep/18/championsleague.celtic\">drew away to Celtic</a> in the opening match of their first ever Champions League campaign, but have had a poor start to their domestic season, amassing just seven points from their first eight games. </p> <p>Holders Manchester United also drew their first game of the Champions League, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/sep/17/manchesterunited.villarreal\">against Villarreal</a>, this season and travel to Denmark having seen off Bolton 2-0 on Saturday, with the ease of their comfortable win having been overlooked in all the hoopla over the ridiculous penalty award gifted to them by referee Rob Styles. \"The most important thing is that Aalborg get our respect. We must make sure we don't fall into any traps and play to our best level,\" said Sir Alex Ferguson, shortly before taking his self-imposed vow of silence.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>AaB:</strong> 1-Karim Zaza; 3-Martin Pedersen, 4-Michael Beauchamp, 6-Steve Olfers, 16-Kaspar Bogelund; 21-Kasper Risgard, 9-Thomas Augustinussen; 23-Thomas Enevoldsen, 8-Andreas Johansson, 14-Jeppe Curth; 10-Marek Saganowski. <br><strong>Subs:</strong> Stenild, Due, Caca, Braemer, Sorensen,<br>Kristensen, Ronnie Schwartz Nielsen.</p> <p><strong>Man Utd:</strong> 1-Edwin van der Sar; 3-Patrice Evra, 15-Nemanja Vidic, 5-Rio Ferdinand, 21-Rafael; 17-Nani, 22-John O'Shea, 18-Paul Scholes, 7-Cristiano Ronaldo; 9-Dimitar Berbatov, 10-Wayne Rooney <br><strong>Subs:</strong> Amos, Brown, Anderson, Giggs, Park, Evans, Tevez.</p> <p><strong>Referee:</strong> Olegario Benquerenca (Portugal)</p> <p>The only surprise inclusion in the Manchester United's side is curly-haired Brazilian tyro Rafael Da Silva at right-back, ahead of Wes Brown.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>Interesting fact you might not know about AaB, if like me you believe everything you read on Wikipedia:</strong> The club was founded in 1885 by English engineers who were building Jutland's railway system and was originally a cricket club.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>First email of the evening:</strong> Will Sir Alex Ferguson be extending his vow of silence as far as MUTV and the club magazine?\" asks Gary Naylor. \"I suppose not. Didn't this sort of thing go out of fashion with Pravda and the V\u00f6lkischer Beobachter? For the universally acknowledged Numero Uno in the world's best supported club to treat his fans in this way is hubris of the highest order.\"</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>Champions League update:</strong> Real Madrid have just beaten Zenit St Petersburg 2-1 in a cracking game of football. Quite how Zenit didn't win by seven or eight goals is anyone's guess, as they completely outplayed Real in the second half, spurning no end of glorious scoring opportunities in the process.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>Another email:</strong> \"This game is rife with Wigan power,\" writes Adam Leier, a Latics fan in New York. \"Bruce Rioch used to manage Wigan and Andreas Johansson used to play for them. He's pretty deadly! He was the most effective goal scorer of 05/06 per minutes played in the Premier League. He also hold the record for joint fastest red card in PL history, in the final game at Highbury, which led to a penalty, which lead to the final goal ever scored at Highbury.\"</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>Game on:</strong> The home side line up wearing red and white striped shirts with tasteful white and gold epaulettes, white shorts and white socks. Manchester United line up in blue shirts, shorts and socks. According to ITV4's fancy graphic, AaB will play a 4-1-4-1 formation, with Thomas Augustinussen patrolling the space in front of his back four and Marek Saganowski alone up front. Expect United to play a 4-4-2, with Wayne Rooney and Dimitar Berbatov up front.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>1 min:</strong> AaB win a throw-in deep in United territory, down near the corner flag. The ball's chucked into the mixer and United clear.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>2 min:</strong> Nani picks up the ball on the left wing, cuts inside and let's fly from 25 yards. His shot stings Kaspar Bogelund's thigh before being hacked clear. \"Is Sir Alex revealing his 'blue steel' look in the photo at the top of your article?\" asks Niall Glynn.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>4 min:</strong> Dimitar Berbatov volleys wide of an open goal after Ronaldo charges down a poor clearance from AaB goalkeeper Zaza who, to be fair, was left horribly exposed by a dreadful backpass from one of his defenders. The ball looped up in the air and dropped kindly for Berbatov, whose decision to opt for power rather than precision tells you all you need to know about his form at the moment.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>6 min:</strong> Great save by Zaza who blocks a Rio Ferdinand volley from six yards with his shins. Manchester United are running rings around AaB at the moment - it's only a matter of time before they score.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>10 min:</strong> AaB attack and Thomas Enevoldsen curls a wonderful low ball across the edge of the Manchester United six-yard box, forcing Patrice Evra to concede a corner from which Andreas Johansson should have scored. The ball dropped beautifully for the Wigan old boy, but he tried to put his laces through the ball and ended up kicking fresh air.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>12 min:</strong> From the left wing, Nani tries to play Cristiano Ronaldo in behind the Aalborg defence, but the ref correctly penalises him for offside. From the ensuing free-kick, AaB launch another sortie deep into Manchester United half, with Kaspar Bogelund getting in behind the left back, only to see Patrice Evra recover in time to cut out his attempted cross.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>14 min:</strong> I'm not sure what's wrong with Paul Scholes, but he's just been carried off the pitch by stretcher-bearers, sitting up on his conveyance looking mightily fed up but in no particular distress. He is immediately replaced by Ryan Giggs, who takes up a position in the centre of midfield alongside John O'Shea.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>16 min:</strong> Just outside his own penalty area, Giggs gets caught in possession by Thomas Augustinussen, who barges straight into Nemanja Vidic. The Serb stand his ground and wins a free-kick for Manchester United.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>19 min:</strong> Rafael Da Silva has a shot from distance, forcing Karim Zaza to parry his low drive straight into the path of ... a defender, who taps it out for a corner, from which nothing comes. That could have spilled anywhere.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>GOAL! AaB Aalborg 0-1 Manchester United (Rooney 21)</strong> Ryan Giggs picks up the ball in midfield, drills a low through-ball past the sleeping Kasper Bogelund and into the path of Wayne Rooney. He latches on to it just inside the AaB penalty area, before flicking it low past the onrushing Zaza and into the goal.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>24 min:</strong> Bogelund attempts to make amends for his complicity in United's opener by peeling off Ronaldo and volleying a loose ball diagonally from right to left inside United's penalty area. A marvellous saving tackle from Rio Ferdinand helps keep the Danish side scoreless.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>27 min:</strong> \"Let's face it, United are going to hammer AaB in this game,\" writes Nathan Smith. \"The next time someone says that the Champions League should be made up only of national champions, maybe you should point them towards this terrible anti-climax. The group-stages can get pretty tedious, but at least you're guaranteed a few decent games and a bit of tension. Remember the days when you could win a European Cup by beating Bruges in the final?\" Bruges? It wasn't so long ago you could win the European Cup by beating Liverpool in the final.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>28 min:</strong> Terrible ball from Marek Saganowski who, with all the time in the world and the ball at his feet just outside the Manchester United penalty area, sends a low pass for Bogueland to chase into the corner. There's too much weight on it and despite Bogelund's best Nijinsky impersonation, it dribbles over the end-line for a goal-kick.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>32 min:</strong> With AaB centre-half Michael Beauchamp lying prostrate on the floor injured after a tussle with Nani, Ronaldo incurs the wrath of the crowd by trying a shot on goal instead of putting the ball out of play. AaB left-back Martin Pedersen, who appears to model his look on Billy Idol (tattoos, spiky bleach blond hair and a temperament to match) takes issue with Ronaldo's lack of sportsmanship and goes for him, forcing Wayne Rooney to step in and act as peacemaker.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>34 min:</strong> Beauchamp is forced to go off injured - he must have pulled something while stretching acrobatically for a clearance against Nani. He's not having much luck in the Champions League this season - he got sent off in a case of mistaken identity against Celtic. Pedersen fought his corner there too - offering to lie on the grenade and walk instead.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>38 min:</strong> Rafael Da Silva gets booked for a completely unnecessary lunge on Martin Pedersen.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>40 min:</strong> Pedersen tries to run the ball out of defence, but a sloppy pass gifts possession to Rafael. The young Brazilian sets off on a searing run down the right flank, before prodding the ball across the edge of the six yard box for Rooney to chase. Offside.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>42 min:</strong> Rafael hogs the headlines again, this time trying to curl a left-footed effort in from distance. He doesn't quite get hold of it, but forces a corner out of goalkeeper Zaza. Corner for United, from which Berbatov almost - but inevitably doesn't - score. He's done nothing in this half and looks like he couldn't care less.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>44 min:</strong> AaB midfielder Jeppe Curth runs on to a cross from Kaspar Boguelend and sends a dipping chip into the sky. It's a good effort, but sadly for him, it lands on the roof of the net.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>44+1 min:</strong> \"Can you explain why AaB's Beauchamp is being pronounced Beecham?\" asks Steve Hewitt. \"It does my head in. His accent is antipodean, but that's no excuse.\" I don't know, Steve. I thought all people pronounced that name Beecham. And let's face it, it wouldn't be the first thing an Australian got wrong. Maybe he's a very effective remedy for cold and flu?</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>Half-time</strong></p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>46 min:</strong> The second half is underway.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>47 min:</strong> Corner for Manchester United, conceded by Kasper Risgaard. The ball is sent in to the mixer, where Pedersen steals the ball off Rooney's toe and gallops out of his own penalty area on another counter-attack before picking out Thomas Enevoldsen. He cuts inside Rafael Da Silva before slashing a wild shot from distance over the bar.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>49 mins:</strong> Ryan Giggs picks up the ball in the final third, shimmies his way into a shooting position and pulls the trigger. His effort is blocked by Caca ... who I may have forgotten to mention, is the attacking midfielder who replaced injured centre-half Beauchamp.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>51 min:</strong> A clumsy knee-on-knee challenge from Johansson leaves Rafael Da Silva writhing on the deck in agony. The AaB defender picks up a yellow card for his troubles, while the United full-back is carried off on a stretcher, where he gets a bit of treatment before coming back on.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>Goal! AaB Aalborg 0-2 Manchester United (Berbatov 55)</strong> My report of Dimitar Berbatov's first goal in a Manchester United shirt disappears when I try to launch it, only to be mysteriously replaced by a chunk of text from Scott Murray's report on Arsenal v FC Porto. Weird. Anyway, that's been bounced out of this report now, back to where it belongs. It was a comical goal - the Bulgarian was teed up by a farcical attempt at a back-pass from AaB skipper Thomas Augustinussen and had the good grace to look embarrassed after controlling the ball before smashing it past AaB goalkeeper Karim Zaza.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>63 min:</strong> Things you've missed while our minute-by-minute tools have gone into meltdown and started flashing up \"administrative error\" messages: Wayne Rooney having to go off injured, his replacement Carlos Tevez having a goal disallowed for hand-ball, the AaB goalkeeper being booked for trying to steal that all-important yard at a goal-kick instead of taking it from the edge of the six-yard box, the last vestiges of Wes Brown's dignity ebbing away as he's brought on to replace a 19-year-old.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>67 min:</strong> Andreas Johansson saunters through the Manchester United defence like somebody dribbling around training cones, before laying the ball off to team-mate Jeppe Curth. He shoots into the side-netting under pressure from Nemanja Vidic.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>70 min:</strong> \"Only 20 minutes to go,\" chirrups ITV4 commentator Clive Tyldesley. Only? This games is well and truly over as a contest - AaB might have nicked one back, but there isn't a hope of them two.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>74 min:</strong> Ronaldo tries a low, dipping 25-yarder which Karim Zaza does well to hold on to.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>75 min:</strong> Not for the first time this evening, Kasper Bogelund charges forward from the AaB right-back position, deep into the United half. With three players queuing up for the cross, he puts too much welly on his delivery and sends it flying high over their heads.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>76 min:</strong> Thomas Envoldsen sends an excellent cross from the left wing towards the back post, where Andreas Johansson literally clambers all over Patrice Evra before heading narrowly wide. No free-kick is forthcoming - the goal would have counted if he'd hit the target.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>GOAL! AaB Aalborg 0-3 Manchester United (Berbatov 78)</strong> Critiano Ronaldo skins Martin Pedersen down the right wing and sends in a cross, which bounces around waist-height beside Berbatov, who swivels on one foot before expertly volleying the ball past Zaza. It was an excellent strike, but having graduated from the Thierry Henry school of unconvincing brooding indifference, he's far too cool to celebrate his strike and focuses all his efforts on unsuccessfully attempting to stifle a grin instead.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>83 min:</strong> Berbatov turns provider, using the outside of his right boot to stroke an inch-perfect pass into the path of the onrushing Ronaldo. He takes the ball wide of the goalkeeper, narrowing the angle he has to shoot at in the process, before firing a lazy effort a foot wide of the near post.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>89 min:</strong> Both sets of players, both managers and all the fans are clock-watching at this stage, as am I.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>90+1 min:</strong> AaB go forward in search of a consolation, but Evra puts a stop to Caca's gallop, before sending Ronaldo on his way. The referee puts AaB out of their misery with a sharp blast on his whistle - it's game over. </p> <p>Elsewhere in this group, Celtic have just lost to Villarreal at the Madrigal. Their record away from home in the Champions League remains abysmal. United and Villarreal top the group with four points from two games, while AaB and Celtic have one point each and will almost certainly be left left scrapping over the Uefa Cup crumbs. </p>",
  "<p>To read the headlines, you'd think the end of the world was nigh. The collapse of the $700bn US bail-out of the global financial system attracts dire warnings across the UK papers. We are \"Staring into the abyss\" (Telegraph) and facing a \"World of Pain\" (Mirror) after the \"Meltdown on Wall Street\" (Mail) and the <a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/money/article1749345.ece\">\"Blackest Monday\"</a> (Sun).</p> <p>According to the Times, the world faces a new phase in the financial crisis now that plans for the <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article4848747.ece\">\"biggest rescue of Wall Street since the Great Depression lies in tatters\"</a>. The financial system is lurching closer to a \"catastrophic breakdown\" after Wall Street suffered one of the worst days in its history.<br> The paper's economics commentator, Anatole Kalestky, offers some hope: \"In one form or another, the package will surely be passed in the next few days.\" The alternative, he writes, would be the failure of every leading bank in America and, for the rest of the world - particularly Britain - the nationalisation of all leading banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions. The US broadsheets use more measured headlines than their UK counterparts, but their analysis is no less severe. The Washington Post says the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/29/AR2008092900623.html\">\"bipartisan rebellion\"</a> that killed the rescue plan sent \"global stock prices plunging, prompting fierce recriminations on the presidential campaign trail and dealing President Bush his worst legislative defeat\". The paper says that although Democratic and Republican leaders have vowed to go back into negotiations to devise compromise legislation, no talks have been scheduled. </p> <p>Twice as many Democrats as Republicans backed the plan in last night's vote in the House of Representatives, the New York Times reports. It says some Republicans cited ideological objections to government intervention while liberal Democrats said they were of no mind to race to aid Wall Street tycoons. </p> <p>But the fundamental reason for the defeat was \"an outpouring of opposition from deeply hostile constituents just five weeks before every seat in the House was up for election\". <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/30/business/30cong.html\">\"House members in potentially tough races and those seeking Senate seats fled from the plan in droves,\"</a> the paper says. </p> <p>New York's Daily News lists the <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/money/2008/09/29/2008-09-29_president_bush_nancy_pelosi_among_bigges-1.html\">biggest losers</a> from the blocked bail-out, including Bush, the Republican presidential candidate, John McCain, and retired people, who are advised to use their pension statements for kindling. </p> <p>Time magazine says the origins of the bail-out defeat go back a long way. The vote itself was a <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1845655,00.html\">\"popular revolt\"</a> against Bush and almost every other US political leader and is the \"culmination of a historic sense of betrayal that Americans have long felt for their representatives in Washington\".</p> <p>At a time when the US is going through such huge turmoil, the Los Angeles Times finds time to highlight the woes of the hundreds of UK investment bankers who are suddenly out of work. The cafes of Canary Wharf have been transformed into <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fg-britecon30-2008sep30,0,5189956.story\">\"career triage centres\"</a>, the paper's reporter in London says, while a meeting for would-be teachers attracted 80 people. \"Teaching does offer security,\" the man from the teacher training unit helpfully pointed out.</p> <p>Those investment bankers could be joined in the unemployment lines by staff from the newly nationalised Bradford &amp; Bingley.

  "<p>An unexpected consequence of Labour's first landslide in 1997 was its reappearance in semi-rural areas. For the first time since agriculture workers stopped being a power to be reckoned with in party consultations, rural affairs mattered, and not only in the context of banning foxhunting. Labour MPs discovered that it was possible to be seriously poor in the most picturesque of settings, and to be overcrowded or poorly housed amid rolling acres. Many reports were commissioned, even more recommendations made. But nothing was actually done.</p> <p>Yesterday, the <a href=\"http://www.cpre.org.uk/news/view/532\">Campaign to Protect Rural England</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.housing.org.uk/default.aspx?tabid=212&amp;mid=828&amp;ctl=Details&amp;ArticleID=1454\">National Housing Federation</a> jointly warned that 700,000 people are now on the housing waiting lists in rural areas, and that more than a third of the homeless in the UK live in the country. The reason is not hard to find. In Dorset, the average family home costs 17 times the average family income. (It's not the worst: in south Buckinghamshire it's 25 times).</p> <p>And the reason for that, as the Lib Dem MP Matthew Taylor <a href=\"http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/livingworkingcountryside \">reported</a> to Gordon Brown in July, is urban flight. In the last 10 years (uncanny symmetry, this) 800,000 people have moved out of town into the country. The rural population is expected to increase at nearly twice the rate of the national increase.</p> <p>And it's not a sudden spurt provoked by the recent prosperity, although that's done damage too \u2013 two cottages knocked into one, the sale of public housing, and the acquisition of a holiday home. But it's more than that. When questioned, a sixth of us dream of living out of town.</p> <p>As a result, people who live in the country are less likely to work there. They commute into town. The people who work in the country (who earn 25% less than people doing similar jobs in large towns) live on the urban fringe and commute into the villages. It's an object lesson in unsustainability.</p> <p>One reason why Labour has done so little to tackle the problem is that there is no easy answer. John Prescott demanded three million new homes; he tried the idea of eco-towns to buy off the hostility. Finding a way round chronic nimbyism has proved impossible. The government is changing planning law. But Ireland, the land with a bungalow in every view, is a grim warning of what can happen if the pendulum swings too far.</p> <p>Yesterday afternoon in Birmingham, in the heart of one of Britain's biggest conurbations, this improbable alliance of the one-time tweedies of the CPRE and the NHF, the organisation that speaks for housing associations, argued for a new approach \u2013 more funding, but also more local involvement in designating land for affordable housing, top-quality design, and more restrictions on Right to Buy to stop housing built for low-paid locals being sold on the open market. The big new idea is <a href=\"http://www.communitylandtrust.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=blogcategory&amp;id=16&amp;Itemid=39\">Community Land Trusts</a>, local organisations that buy land expressly for affordable housing and retain control of it.</p> <p>There is a consensus building around these ideas. Matthew Taylor's report on the <a href=\"http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/planningandbuilding/livingworkingcountryside\">Living Working Countryside</a> proposes maximising local influence on housing strategies, while the Tories are <a href=\"http://www.conservatives.com/Policy/Where_we_stand/Countryside.aspx\">looking at ways</a> of incentivising development so that communities drop the resistance that has often been the source of their local councillors' political power.</p> <p>There is little time left. \"Villages,\" Matthew Taylor warned, \"are already becoming American-style gated communities. The only difference is that the gate is the price.\"</p>",
  "<p>The next time Danny Cipriani finds himself with a spare hour or two between photoshoots he should sit down with a copy of Ronan O'Gara's newly-published autobiography. We are not exactly talking James Joyce or Oscar Wilde here but, then again, neither of them ever played international rugby at outside-half. If Cipriani wants a glimpse of what the future might hold he would be well advised to put Ulysses aside and enter Rog's world.</p> <p>It is a fascinating place, particularly if you hail from outside Ireland. What comes through strongest is that talent on its own is never enough. O'Gara has his critics but his steely determination slices through almost every page. When he was a teenager coming up through the ranks he was not even rated the most promising young out-half in Munster. Everyone reckoned Jeremy Staunton was the wonder kid and O'Gara has the cuttings to prove it. He can still recall the shock of being left out of the Ireland Schools team in 1994 for a certain Emmet Farrell. No-one imagined when he started that Munster would become the best team in Europe and O'Gara's entire career has been one long fight to prove himself in the toughest of environments. Neither he nor his team give the impression they are done yet.</p> <p>O'Gara, assisted by his elegant ghostwriter Denis Walsh, is nicely self-deprecating too. Mixed in with the magnificent Munster memories are passages that do more than hint at the less attractive aspects of life as a professional player. Take the morning after the Bay of Plenty game against the Lions in 2005 during which he missed several first-half tackles. \"Knows how to kick to the corners but Ronan Keating would be a better tackler,\" concluded the New Zealand Herald. \"Kiwis know their rugby and they know a lemon when they see one,\" sneered another local chronicler. \"O'Gara should have painted himself yellow and jumped in a gin and tonic.\"</p> <p>It is a bitter verdict, particularly when directed at a player who used to be paranoid about what other people thought of him. He still finds dealing with strangers tricky. \"I'd say people find me rude. A couple of people have told me so straight out. They were right. I'm not comfortable being a face people recognise. I really struggle with match days ... even afterwards I don't like the back-slapping. I know it's only a game and I should relax a bit more but I don't believe I could think like that and still perform.\" He sounds happiest on those days when he is able to sneak out, anonymous beneath a baseball cap, to attend midweek mass. </p> <p>It comes as little surprise, therefore, to read he was incandescent with rage last year when a reporter and a photographer from a Sunday tabloid rang his doorbell, keen to dig up some dirt on some non-existent marital problems. \"People like you are what's wrong with modern Ireland,\" he screeched at the hack. \"You're a low life.\" At which point in the narrative, the paparazzi-plagued Cipriani may just experience a flicker of recognition. No one ever accused Cipriani of lacking self-confidence. He has more natural talent than O'Gara has ever had. But via the pages of the Cork man's revealing, hard-nosed book, the young genius will discover that recuperating from a shattered ankle is merely the first of many hurdles set to examine not just his rugby ability but his private life and, occasionally, his sanity. He might even care to flick to page 282 to discover what Munster thought of him last season: \"Cipriani is a talented guy but he didn't hurt us in either game.\" </p> <p>Rugby is partly about talent, of course it is. But most of all, as O'Gara reminds us, it is about desire and bloody-mindedness and knocking the English down a peg or two. Danny Boy has already discovered that life is not always a posy of violets but a couple of hours with Ronan will familiarise him with fame's darker side.</p> <p><em>Ronan O'Gara: My Autobiography, published by Transworld Ireland, is out now</em></p> <h2>A hard day's night</h2> <p>It's a tough call but the first half of Leicester v Wasps last Friday night may just have been the most depressingly barren 40 minutes of top-level rugby I have ever seen. Those who watched the appalling 3-3 draw between Toulon and Brive earlier this season begged to differ and, heaven knows, there have been loads of dodgy matches under assorted different laws down the years. But here's a thesis: nine times out of 10 in the winter months you get a better game in daylight rather than under the lights. This week, with autumn drawing in, there are six midweek Premiership fixtures, all evening kick-offs. Hopefully, they will all be exceptions to the gloomy rule but don't bet on it. </p> <h2>Bad news for dinosaurs</h2> <p>The Leicester and England hooker George Chuter is not a happy man. \"I was disappointed that some of the [Experimental Law Variation] suggestions I emailed to the IRB appear not to have been considered worthy of even a trial in the Welsh fourth division. These include scrums instead of kick-offs, scrums instead of lineouts, scrums instead of backs moves and the outlawing of any hair product. I don't know where our game is heading but I'm sure it's going to be a place that doesn't welcome fat, slow old people with no hair. I'll get my coat.\" If you bump into George on the streets of Leicester, buy him a coffee and slip him a fiver.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Jeremy Batstone-Carr</strong>, analyst at <strong>Charles Stanley</strong>, said: \"First and foremost, we suspect that all may not be lost. It is likely that neither side will wish to claim victory and that the result is likely to bring the Bill back to the House, with further amendments, for another vote. Note that a relatively small number of dissenters are required to deliver the mere 50% majority necessary to ensure the Bill's passage. Therefore, investors should continue to believe that, despite the high level invective a rescue package will be delivered.</p> <p>\"Investors should note that despite the equity market's violent reaction to the news from Congress, the crisis in the financial markets has never really been about equities. The most strenuous efforts should continue to be made to unfreeze the money markets, the point at which Wall St. and Main St. intersect. Failure to achieve a breakthrough would inevitably give rise to considerably weaker US and global growth than had hitherto been forecast and most likely increase the risk of a long and deep recession as the deleveraging process continues unchecked.\"</p> <p><strong>Paul Ashworth</strong>, senior US economist at<strong> Capital Economics</strong>, said: \"You couldn't make this stuff up if you tried. The rejection by the House of Representatives of the supposedly agreed plan to allow the Treasury to buy up to $700bn of distressed mortgage-backed securities has unsurprisingly sent the stock markets into another tailspin. They forgot the first rule of policy making in a crisis: above all do no harm. Even if a new amended plan can be agreed, we doubt it will be in place until next week at the earliest. Admittedly, we weren't particularly big fans of the Treasury's TARP in the first place, because addressing the lack of liquidity in the market for mortgage-backed securities wouldn't have helped with solving the real problem, which is the destruction of bank capital due to asset write-downs and mounting loan defaults. </p> <p>\"Nevertheless, the program could have helped to reduce some of the stresses in the securities market and improved the functioning of the interbank funding market. As President Bush said after the House vote, 'we've got a big problem'. Too right.\"</p> <p><strong>Bernd Weidensteiner</strong>, analyst at <strong>Commerzbank</strong>, said: \"A number of possible options are now being discussed. A revised version of the package might be put to the House again for approval, and to up the pressure on the house, the Senate might be asked to vote first. The package would almost certainly be approved there. On the other hand, negotiations might start again from scratch, which would mean a very tight schedule for all concerned. On 4 November, after all, the country goes to the polls to elect a new president, House and a third of the Senate. It is equally possible, therefore, that no package will be approved before the new administration takes office in January.</p> <p>\"Until the corresponding legislation is passed, the Fed and the Treasury secretary will have to make do with whatever means are available. The FDIC will proceed with its endeavours to oversee consolidation in the banking sector. The Treasury secretary can perhaps have recourse to the Exchange Stabilisation Fund to come to the aid of faltering banks. However, the Fed will have to bear the brunt of battling the crisis, and will use all the means currently at its disposable \u2013 and possibly additional instruments \u2013 to keep the money market from the grip of paralysis.\"</p> <p><strong>Alex Potter</strong> at <strong>Collins Stewart</strong> said: \"Firstly, the plan is likely to be renegotiated over the rest of this week (though with a break for Jewish New Year) with a view to another vote in a week. Most commentators appear to be expecting a watered-down bill second time around. Secondly, the margin of defeat (225-208) was relatively small, so some small concessions would appear likely to secure the bill. </p> <p>\"The US government is clearly hoping that, with cleaner balance sheets, liquidity will return to the US banks and the wholesale money markets will become functional again. There would clearly be collateral benefits to the UK &amp; Europe, in our view. However, we do feel that liquidity will more likely be tempted back when underlying asset prices (mainly houses) stabilise and this seems a distant prospect yet. The only alternative is a solution that includes previous main liquidity providers not just central banks. This would include Mid-Eastern petrodollar funds, sovereign wealth funds, state investment bodies, Chinese &amp; Indian governments and the Japanese pension system. This will also take time.\"</p>",
  "<p>The schools minister, Lord Adonis, has set out his ambitions for a national network of cadet forces, to be shared between the independent and state sectors. </p> <p>Introducing cadet forces to disadvantaged areas of the country, starting in the capital, would help improve pupils' confidence and self-reliance, he told the annual meeting of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC), which represents 250 private schools, today. </p> <p>He also announced new plans to partner every London state school with a university under the London Challenge scheme, which supports under-performing schools. He said every school in the country could ultimately follow this model.</p> <p>Combined Cadet Forces (CCF) is the volunteer youth wing of the armed forces. Pupils aged between 13 and 18 are trained in army, navy and air force skills including marching, shooting and cooking army rations. </p> <p>Adonis said: \"Cadets can be a real force for good in our schools. The experience provides not only fun, healthy activities for young people but they also encourage valuable personal attributes, help to build skills and, using military themes based upon the culture and ethos of the single services, foster confidence, self reliance, initiative, resourcefulness, loyalty and a sense of service to others. </p> <p>\"This initiative is another example of the emerging spirit of cooperation between state and independent schools, which we must continue to foster and encourage.\"</p> <p>Aldenham school in Hertfordshire, City of London school, Whitgift school in Croydon and Highgate Boys in north London will be among the first independent schools to set up schemes. </p> <p>The cadet plan is starting with six London private schools in multiple partnerships with state schools. It follows months of negotiations between the Department for Children, Schools and Families and the Ministry of Defence. </p> <p>Adonis has insisted \u2013 in the face of criticisms from teachers' unions over the plans \u2013 that arguments against cadet forces in schools are \"spurious\".</p> <p>Unions have accused the MoD of recruiting in schools and some have expressed fears about the connotations of children who may be growing up in violent neighbourhoods having access to weapons. </p> <p>Peter Lonsdale, a long-standing adult CCF volunteer, has been appointed a \"cadet ambassador\" to help set up the schemes. He said that the forces' recruitment strategies were completely separate to the cadet forces but he acknowledged concerns about weaponry being condoned to pupils who may experience violence in their communities. </p> <p>\"I empathise with that view. There are people who are against the army for religious, philosophical or political reasons. But from my perspective, shooting is an Olympic sport and taught properly it can encourage respect and self-control. Pupils have to pass a test, which can take four months before they are allowed access to weaponry. I would prefer they learn respect for weapons in a safe environment than behind the bike shed.\"</p>",

  "<p>I have chosen to argue the case for <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/disraeli_benjamin.shtml\">Benjamin Disraeli</a> for the Guardian's debate on the greatest Tory hero because he encapsulates three characteristics which resonate today: social responsibility; localism; and pragmatism.</p> <p>TV history channels tend to imply that history only began in 1939, and that the vast majority of it involved Germany between 1939 and 1945. But, as we host the first Conservative party conference in Birmingham for around 75 years, I have been struck by the things we can learn from further back in our own past, and especially by what we can learn from Tory success more than a century ago.</p> <p>Here in Birmingham, we are surrounded by living, working monuments to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Chamberlain\">Joseph Chamberlain</a>'s period in charge of this great city where I grew up. For example, Birmingham's main thoroughfare, Corporation Street, was developed under Chamberlain's watch. Of course, Chamberlain started out as a Liberal, but he was only able to make the profound improvements that he did because of the social reform legislation introduced by Disraeli.</p> <p>Disraeli's social reforms, like the <a href=\"http://www.opsi.gov.uk/RevisedStatutes/Acts/ukpga/1875/cukpga_18750055_en_1\">Public Health Act</a> (1875) and the <a href=\"http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/acts/artisans-dwellings-act-1875\">Artisans' Dwelling House Act</a> (1875), put real autonomy in the hands of local authorities to tackle what was then called \"the Condition of England question\". These laws were not suffocating top-down rules, but empowering legislation that made a real difference to people's lives. Disraeli once said that \"permissive legislation is the characteristic of a free people\". There is no more powerful lesson for Conservatives today.</p> <p>So Disraeli used local expertise to provide local solutions to local problems. But localism was not the only legacy he left. He also forged a newly pragmatic form of Conservatism. He understood that a party that had little to say about the \"two nations\" would be forever sidelined in a more democratic age.</p> <p>A decade ago, the Conservative party was pushed back to its core vote, much of it in rural areas. If you transpose an electoral map of our landslide defeat in 1997 on an electoral map of the mid-19th century, they are very alike. It was Disraeli above all who made the Conservative party a force that could be equally appealing to all of the country, and who stopped it from becoming an exclusively rural party forever condemned to obscurity.</p> <p>That has never been a tempting prospect. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris\">Boris Johnson</a>'s victory in London shows that, today, we are once again making waves in our great cities. And it was Disraeli who was responsible for three key themes of social responsibility, localism and pragmatism which, above all, explain the resurgence of the Conservative party under David Cameron. Here in Birmingham this week, for example, we are launching new policies to ease the council tax burden, to help young unskilled people and to improve public transport. It is likely that Disraeli would have been understood, and welcomed, the programmes that we are developing.</p>",

  "<p>Madam Speaker, when was the last time someone asked you for $700bn?</p> <p>It is a number that is staggering, but tells us only the costs of the Bush administration's failed economic policies: policies built on budgetary recklessness, on an anything-goes mentality, with no regulation, no supervision, and no discipline in the system.</p> <p>Democrats believe in the free market, which can and does create jobs, wealth, and capital. But left to its own devices, it has created chaos.</p> <p>That chaos is the dismal picture painted by Treasury Secretary [Henry)] Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman [Ben] Bernanke a week and a half ago in the Capitol. As they pointed out, we confront a crisis of historic magnitude that has the ability to do serious injury not simply to our economy but to the American people; not just to Wall Street, but to everyday Americans on Main Street.</p> <p>It is our responsibility today, to help avert that catastrophic outcome. Let us be clear: This is a crisis caused on Wall Street. But it is a crisis that reaches to Main Street in every city and town of the United States.</p> <p>It is a crisis that freezes credit, causes families to lose their homes, cripples small businesses, and makes it harder to find jobs. It is a crisis that never had to happen. It is now the duty of every member of this body to recognise that the failure to act responsibly, with full protections for the American taxpayer, would compound the damage already done to the financial security of millions of American families.</p> <p>Over the past several days, we have worked with our Republican colleagues to fashion an alternative to the original plan of the Bush administration.</p> <p>I must recognise the outstanding leadership provided by [the chairman of the House financial services committee and Democrat of Massachusetts] Barney Frank, whose enormous intellectual and strategic abilities have never before been so urgently needed, or so widely admired.</p> <p>I also want to recognise [Illinois Democratic Republican] Rahm Emanuel, who combined his deep knowledge of financial institutions with his pragmatic policy experience to resolve key disagreements.</p> <p>Secretary Paulson deserves credit for working day and night to help reach an agreement, and for his flexibility in negotiating changes to his original proposal.</p> <p>Democrats insisted that legislation responding to this crisis must protect the American people and Main Street from the meltdown on Wall Street.</p> <p>The American people did not decide to dangerously weaken our regulatory and oversight policies. They did not make unwise and risky financial deals. They did not jeopardise the economic security of the nation. And they must not pay the cost of this emergency recovery and stabilisation bill.</p> <p>So we insisted that this bill contain several key provisions. This legislation must contain independent and ongoing oversight to ensure that the recovery programme is managed with full transparency and strict accountability.</p> <p>The legislation must do everything possible to allow as many people to stay in their homes rather than face foreclosure.</p> <p>The corporate CEOs whose companies will benefit from the public's participation in this recovery must not benefit by exorbitant salaries and golden parachute retirement bonuses.</p> <p>Our message to Wall Street is this: the party is over. The era of golden parachutes for high-flying Wall Street operators is over. No longer will the US taxpayer bail out the recklessness of Wall Street. The taxpayers who bear the risk in this recovery must share in the upside as the economy recovers.</p> <p>And should this programme not pay for itself, the financial institutions that benefited, not the taxpayers, must bear responsibility for making up the difference.</p> <p>These were the Democratic demands to safeguard the American taxpayer, to help the economy recover, and to impose tough accountability as a central component of this recovery effort.</p> <p>This legislation is not the end of congressional activity on this crisis. Over the course of the next few weeks, we will continue to hold investigative and oversight hearings to find out how the crisis developed, where mistakes were made, and how the recovery must be managed to protect the middle class and the American taxpayer.</p> <p>With passage of this legislation today, we can begin the difficult job of turning our economy around, of helping those who depend on a growing economy and stable financial institutions for a secure retirement, for the education of their children, for jobs and small business credit.</p> <p>Today we must act for those Americans, for Main Street, and we must act now, with the bipartisan spirit of cooperation which allowed us to fashion this legislation.</p> <p>This not enough. We are also working to restore our nation's economic strength by passing a new economic recovery stimulus package, a robust, job-creating bill that will help Americans struggling with high prices, get our economy back on track and renew the American dream.</p> <p>Today we will act to avert this crisis, but informed by our experience of the past eight years, with the failed economic leadership that has left us less capable of meeting the challenges of the future.</p> <p>We choose a different path. In the new year, with a new Congress and a new president, we will break free with a failed past and take America in a new direction to a better future.</p>",
  "<p>Internet radio stations threatened with closure in the US are on the verge of securing their future, after a groundswell of support from users.</p> <p>Tim Westergren, who founded popular <a href=\"http://www.pandora.com/\">online music service Pandora</a>, said that phone calls from thousands of fans helped to repel a \"sneak attack\" by media industry lobbyists who were attempting to derail new legislation.</p> <p>\"We emailed all our listeners and said to them to call their representative, and buried the Hill in phone calls,\" Westergren said yesterday. \"We beat back a concerted attempt to knock us out.\"</p> <p>Pandora - which uses detailed analysis of individual music tracks to create personalised playlists - is among the world's most popular internet radio stations, with 17 million registered users.</p> <p>However, it was among a number of services that faced closure after American legislators decided to drastically increase the level of royalties that internet broadcasters should pay for streaming music over the web.</p> <p>The changes require them to hand over around 70% of their income in performance royalties. By contrast, satellite radio providers pay around 7.5% through the same mechanism, while traditional radio broadcasters pay no performance royalties at all.</p> <p>A new proposal which gives internet radio stations more time to renegotiate the settlement was put forward, but organisations including the <a href=\"http://www.nab.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Home\">National Association of Broadcasters</a> had attempted to scupper the deal. </p> <p>However, with grassroots campaigners swamping senators and representatives over the issue, Westergren said he was confident the new deal would succeed in the next few days. </p> <p>He also suggested that the incident could be a breakthrough moment for those who want to harness consumer power online to fight established Capitol Hill lobbyists.</p> <p>\"Can you imagine even five years ago that an arcane law in the bottom of a bill, surrounded by lobbyists, would be fought so that they had to renegotiate?\"</p> <p>\"We have the ability to bring so much pressure to bear,\" he added. \"I hope what we did will become a model for other people.\"</p> <p>Westergren also said that he was keen to move forward with deals elsewhere in the world, including the UK. </p> <p>The service has not been available outside the United States since last July, after the company pulled the plug following threats of legal action from record labels. The situation has left the market to rivals such as <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/\">Last.fm</a> which have negotiated individual deals with record companies.</p> <p>But Westergren said he was confident that progress could be made once the right settlement was made in the US.</p> <p>\"We've made no progress in the past 18 months,\" he admitted. \"But we think we can take this as a template around the world. As soon as we're done here, I'm going to get on a boat.\"</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron\">David Cameron</a> pledged to put party politics aside in the wake of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/30/marketturmoil.globaleconomy\">global financial crisis</a> today and work with the government to create stability in the markets.</p> <p>Reflecting on the consequences of events in the US overnight, when the Dow Jones index suffered its biggest drop in history after the House of Representatives rejected a $700bn rescue plan for ailing banks, the Conservative leader said people would expect a responsible opposition to act in the national interest.</p> <p>Cameron took time out from the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/toryconference\">Tory party conference</a> in Birmingham to speak to the prime minister last night and today embarked on a round of television and radio interviews to proclaim his party's support for fresh government regulation.</p> <p>The Tory leader is to make a short statement to the conference at 11am today on the financial crisis to offer cross-party support for action to stabilise the markets. </p> <p>\"Today of all days a responsible opposition should be there to work with the government,\" Cameron said. \"It is very important that the legislation that is required is cut across party lines,\" he told the BBC.</p> <p>On GMTV he added: \"What I've said to the prime minister is that we as a responsible opposition absolutely stand ready to help pass legislation if that is necessary.</p> <p>\"We know there is legislation on bank regulation that needs to go through and as soon as parliament comes back on Monday we are ready to help with that.</p> <p>\"What matters most of all is that we work together to create financial security. Just as you need cross-party working in the US to get this ready so you need cooperation here,\" he said.</p> <p>The refusal of the House of Representatives to endorse the controversial bailout plan was \"very worrying\", the Conservative leader said, echoing Brown.</p> <p>Insisting that a free market system \"does need rules\", the Tory chief called for a new law to protect savers' deposits.</p> <p>And he would still ask \"important questions\" about legislation while helping to get necessary measures on to the statute book.</p> <p>Cameron called for a new scheme that \"absolutely safeguards\" deposits in banks and building societies.</p> <p>And he criticised the government for only pulling together a deal on the mortgage lender Bradford &amp; Bingley a year after it began to get into trouble.</p> <p>\"Everyone has known for a year about its difficulties, but it was only at the last minute that a deal was put together,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Also we've been saying that the need for legislation so that you can have a Bank of England rescue for these organisations rather than take them onto the national books and nationalisation so that we're all liable, we think that would be a better approach.\"</p> <p>\"There have been huge problems right across the world,\" he said. \"It is important to recognise in the UK, the debt boom went on for far too long. There was no one to call time on it. We need to learn that lesson and put the Bank of England back in charge.</p> <p>\"We need to make sure the government does not live beyond its means.\"</p>",
  "<p>The UK is finally to remove its remaining two opt-outs to the UN convention on the rights of the child. This should give much-needed protection to thousands of children in contact with UK immigration officials, and to <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/almost-3000-children-now-held-in-custody-811779.html\">children held in custody</a> \u2013 but only if ministers reverse harmful policy.</p> <p>Last year over 7,000 children applied for <a href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/immigration-asylum-stats.html\">asylum</a> in the UK; nearly half had no parent or guardian with them.</p> <p>Children in immigration detention (about 2,000 each year) are made to feel like criminals \u2013 dawn raids, long journeys in caged vans, roll counts, and watching their distraught parents being handcuffed and forced onto aeroplanes. When the chief inspector of prisons asked what would make life better, detained children said they would like to go swimming and to return to their schools. </p> <p>Jacqui Smith says the removal of the reservation shows the government's \"commitment to treat children in the UK immigration system with compassion\". Human rights also require respect for each person's human dignity and fair treatment. Current policy fails these tests. </p> <p>The UN committee on the rights of the child asked civil servants in Geneva last week to explain why children who arrive in the UK alone and vulnerable are not given a guardian, to account for differences in care and education and to explain why children can be prosecuted for not having the right documents. Challenging questions, because the convention obliges governments to always give priority to children's best interests and to protect all children all of the time. </p> <p>The other reservation permits the state to hold children in custody with adults. Its removal should mean an absolute prohibition on girls mixing with women in prison and the end of children in the armed forces who breach military law being imprisoned with adults. </p> <p>The government's announcement does not on its own signal that the UK now fully complies with the convention. The broader treatment of children in the criminal justice system was heavily criticised by the UN committee last week, including the very low age of criminal responsibility, child deaths in custody and the deliberate use of painful restraint. </p> <p>After years of neglect, the removal of the reservations could be a sign that things are changing at last. The UN committee publishes its full analysis and recommendations on Friday. Ministers and civil servants must use this as a blueprint for action. And they should be sure of the public's full support.</p>",

  "<p>On Friday night, the American electorate had an opportunity to hear the two presidential candidates in a head-to-head debate. The outcome of the November election is still hard to predict. But if the electoral roll were expanded to include the population of Europe, then the result would be a fait accompli. As Constanze Stelzenm\u00fcller, director of the Berlin office of the German Marshall Fund, put it in July: \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/20/usa.barackobama\">We made up our minds long ago: our president is Barack Obama.</a>\" </p> <p>Certainly, opinion polls seem to support this assessment. <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/uselection2008/2049446/Barack-Obama-beats-John-McCain-in-European-vote-US-election-2008.html\">A survey conducted in May 2008</a> in five European states (Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Russia) found Obama to be well ahead of John McCain in every case. A <a href=\"http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/node/9326\">subsequent poll</a> in France, Germany and the UK on the eve of his July visit to Europe showed that his lead over his rival had increased in all three countries. And while crowds are notoriously fickle, the astonishing pictures of an adoring multitude at the rally for Obama at the Victory Column in Berlin on July 24 spoke a thousand words. This was the people's choice.</p> <p>But who exactly were they choosing and why?</p> <p>Just prior to Obama's clamorous reception in Berlin, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/21/barackobama.uselections2008\">Gary Younge remarked</a>: \"In the past six months, it has become patently clear people see in him whatever they want to see.\" This has been clear to Obama himself for much longer. \"I am new enough on the national political scene,\" he wrote in 2006 \"that I serve as a blank screen on which people of vastly different political stripes project their own views\" (<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/17/books/17kaku.html\">The Audacity of Hope</a>, page 11). Since hitting the presidential campaign trail in February 2007, however, the screen has become less blank as Obama has set out his political vision in a series of stump speeches.</p> <p>\"America must lead\": this was the keynote of his address at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, and it is one that he has sounded over and again in subsequent speeches on foreign policy. Just nine days before his appearance in Berlin, in a speech in Washington DC on July 15, he again invoked \"the tradition of American leadership on behalf of the global good\" and announced: \"From the moment I take office, I will let it be known that the United States of America is ready to lead again.\"</p> <p>But he did not make this known in Berlin. Not once in his speech to the 200,000 did he mention American leadership. Instead, he peppered the text with words like \"partnership\", \"sharing\" and \"cooperation\". \"My country must stand with yours and with Europe,\" he said, seeming to imply equality and parity. Whereas his speech to the Chicago Council on Global Affairs was called \"The American Moment\", the one in Berlin was \"A World that Stands as One\". The difference in title is telling.</p> <p>So, on the question of America's role beyond its borders, it might look as if there are two candidates with one name. And if Obama is elected in November, the choice of the American people could be different from the one that wowed Berlin. And yet, the two Obamas are not necessarily irreconcilable. There is a way of seeing and hearing him that brings the two figures into alignment.</p> <p>To begin with, we must not automatically equate American leadership with American hegemony. In view of America's recent record abroad, it is difficult for us Europeans to keep these two notions apart. But not only is there a distinction analytically, it could make all the difference politically. That is to say, Obama might be trading on this distinction when addressing his domestic audience. </p> <p>I stress \"domestic\". He knows that across the world people in general are fed up with America's view of itself as head of the herd, as leading the charge for \"freedom and justice\"; fed up because suspicious of the underlying motives and appalled by the results. Abroad, the image of America as a beacon to the world is, to say the least, tarnished. You might say, therefore, that Obama had the good taste not to subject his audience in Europe to this particular brand of inspirational rhetoric.</p> <p>But at home, America is the City on a Hill. This is not just any image. It is the self-image of the republic. In 1630, long before the US was a twinkle in Jefferson's eye, John Winthrop, the first governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, gave a sermon to his congregation of English emigrants: \"[W]e must consider that we shall be as a City Upon a Hill, the eyes of all people are upon us.\" Winthrop was a Puritan and by \"we\", he meant New England. But over time, his radiant simile, which was equally congenial to the enlightenment idea of America as a beacon of liberty, became the indispensable image of \"the indispensable nation\" as Madeleine Albright put it. When Obama says to his fellow Americans \"we must lead the world, by deed and example\", he is holding up the American torch, reminding them what America, in its own eyes, is.</p> <p>But lead the world in what direction? That is the open question. With which deeds and by what manner of example? When these crucial blanks are filled in, the gap between \"the two Obamas\" seems to shrink. Consider an excerpt from his Chicago speech. Affirming his belief that \"the American people will be ready to lead again\", he elucidates: \"They will be ready to show the world that we are not a country that ships prisoners in the dead of night to be tortured in far-off countries. That we are not a country that runs prisons which took people away without ever telling them why they are there or what they are charged with. That we are not a country which preaches compassion and justice to others while we allow bodies to float down the streets of a major American city.\" His call to leadership is a summons to America to put its own house in order.</p> <p>As regards other nations, Obama puts forward the proposition - radical in relation to the status quo of American foreign policy - that putting their houses in order might be more their own business than America's. \"[W]e should be sceptical,\" he writes, \"of those who believe we can single-handedly liberate other people from tyranny.\" He argues that \"when we seek to impose democracy with the barrel of a gun, funnel money to parties whose economic policies are deemed friendlier to Washington, or fall under the sway of exiles like Chalabi\" this retards the possibility that \"genuine, homegrown democracy will ever emerge\" (The Audacity of Hope, pages 316-7). </p> <p>Covering the Berlin rally, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/25/barackobama.germany\">Jonathan Freedland reported</a> that \"the loudest applause came when Obama, however subtly, offered himself as the coming antidote to all that the Germans, Europeans - and most non-Americans - have disliked about the Bush era.\" When Obama, offering himself to the electorate at home, acknowledges that America is \"less respected than at any time in recent history\"; lambasts eight years of a foreign policy \"that lectures without listening\"; calls for \"a new era of international cooperation\"; and says it is better for America \"to act multilaterally rather than unilaterally\": then the gap between \"the two Obamas\" begins to look more rhetorical than real. </p> <p>On the other hand, if you trawl through his speeches you can find plenty of evidence to support a different conclusion. There are those who see Obama as a neocon wolf in Democratic sheep's clothing. I have also encountered the view that his oratory is sheer razzmatazz; that when the hot air dissipates all you are left with is a typical politician who is playing for high stakes. And perhaps Younge has a point: people still see in Obama what they want; even what they fear.</p> <p>Yet there is another possibility. When he addressed the rally in Berlin, he remarked: \"I know that I don't look like the Americans who've previously spoken in this great city\". Appearances are not necessarily deceptive. The possibility exists that Obama does signify a departure, both domestically and globally, from business as usual; that he offers \"change we can believe in\". As self-styled \"leader of the free world\", perhaps he would turn American leadership in another direction: away from American hegemony. It is hard to say - and too soon.</p> <p>Meanwhile, as the November presidential election approaches, all we Europeans can do is watch with bated breath. Not only do we wonder how the American people will cast their vote, we also ask ourselves: if they choose Obama, whom will they have chosen?</p>"
