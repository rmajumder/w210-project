  "<p>Sir Ben Kingsley CBE is on record as telling this paper's Stuart Jeffries last year that he prefers to be addressed as \"Ben. Just Ben.\" But while loitering outside his London hotel room, I am offered some unsolicited advice by the PR assistant from the distributor of his latest film, The Wackness. \"Don't forget to address him as 'Sir Ben',\" she warns severely. \"But he told Stuart Jeffries to call him 'Ben',\" I protest. \"Ooh, I don't know anything about that,\" comes the twitchy reply. \"His people told us it has to be 'Sir.'\" I think I can detect the faint crunching of eggshells.</p> <p>As I am ushered in, the 65-year-old actor sweeps quietly but magnificently toward me across the carpet. He is wearing an immaculately trimmed little beard, and he seems to be floating. He is one of those men who comports himself so confidently that his inner conviction that he is in fact a giant overshadows the reality \u2014 which is that he is small enough to be his own action figure. </p> <p>I must admit I get a bit caught up in his bountiful hospitality. \"Ryan!\" he half-purrs, half-booms, hand outstretched. He could be welcoming me to his daughter's wedding. I reach out and grab that hand as though we haven't seen one another since our salad days at Oxford when we pushed the bursar's bed through the streets for a rag week jape. (Neither of us were at Oxford. But he makes me feel as though we were.)</p> <p>It's lovely. We even seem to be chuckling together at some unspoken joke. That's when it happens. \"Ben!\" I reply warmly, followed instantly by a voice in my head that says: \"D'Oh!\"</p> <p>I register an infinitesimal change in his eyes \u2014 a tremor, a wince \u2014 and somewhere in the background I'm certain I hear a PR being told she will never eat lunch in this town again. But Kingsley recovers quickly, and soon it's all Oxford again. \"What's your background? Tell me about yourself. Do you love your job?\" These are his questions, not mine. Oh yes, I tell him, I love my job. \"Good,\" he says, sounding genuinely relieved, as though he had been mulling over this matter in the hours preceding our meeting. \"Well, I love my job too, so that's something we have in common.\" </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336776247\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/08/19/ben2460.jpg\" alt=\"Ben Kingsley in The Wackness\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>We have come to talk about The Wackness, a baldly manipulative coming-of-age story set in the mid-1990s in which \u2014 hey! \u2014 things are never the same again after that summer. Didn't The Opposite of Sex kill off movies like this? Oh well. At least Kingsley is a treat as Dr Squires, the dope-head psychiatrist with mad-professor hair, to whom Luke, the teenage hero (Josh Peck), turns in his hour of need. Not everyone has warmed to Kingsley's comically indulgent turn as the immature shrink, whose midlife crisis manifests itself in Biggie Smalls impressions and some full-on face-sucking with one of the Olsen twins. Richard Brody in the New Yorker berated what he called Kingsley's \"weird-old-man routine\u2026 [it's] fake and vain, a shameless play for an Oscar nod.\"</p> <p>When I ask Kingsley if playing Squires was like pretending to be a little boy, his eyes light up. \"Yes,\" he says firmly. \"You. Have. Hit. The bull's eye.\" He takes a deep breath, as though recovering from a shock. \"My secret, my shared secret with the director Jonathan Levine \u2014 and sometimes you have to have them \u2014 was exactly that: 'I'm playing the child.' And Jonathan said: 'Got it!'\" All this is delivered in a voice that gets quieter with every word. I think he believes there is an actor in the next suite, whiskey tumbler pressed to the wall, hoping to steal the tricks of his trade. \"And that was my message to myself throughout the shoot,\" he continues. \"'You can't grow up. You cannot grow up.'\"<br> I ask him when he nailed the essence of Dr Squires and, as with my first question, he treats this enquiry with a respectfulness that would be flattering if it weren't so exaggerated. \"It has to happen,\" he says. \"You're absolutely right. It must happen. That 'Ah!' moment. You've got to have it. I'm sure painters have it. They're working away on a canvas and suddenly they go, 'Ah! There it is.' Certainly I knew I wanted Squires to have his brain coming out through his scalp, so I knew he'd need to have hair. Because this\" \u2014 by which he means his own shaved head \u2014 \"is too neat, too contained.\" He strokes his scalp, which is buffed to such a bright sheen that you could use it to check that your tie is straight.</p> <p>\"At that point, I thought, 'Well, I can't quite see the portrait yet, but there's something there \u2014 yes! \u2014 in the corner of the canvas. Look!'\" He is gesturing to an invisible painting. Bizarrely, I find my gaze wandering toward it. \"But it really happened when we shot the first scene. Josh is in my office. He says, 'Do you want me to lie on the couch or anything?' And the way he said it left me no choice but to reply: 'Do ... do you want to lie on the couch?' I realised that everything this man does is for the first time. That was the first little breath of 'Ah!' that I found.\"</p> <p>The joy of being in Kingsley's company is that he seems to have slipped his moorings. This sensation has also permeated his work since Sexy Beast, the 2000 thriller that represented a miraculous on-screen rebirth. His portrayal of the gangster Don Logan, who was barking in both senses of the word, comprehensively altered the world's perception of him; it was like no other image-reboot since Brando in The Godfather. Playing the title role in Richard Attenborough's 1982 Gandhi had dragged him from relative obscurity and won him the Best Actor Oscar, but in career terms it also left him washed up on a desert island with other people's reverence for company. How do you cast someone whom the whole world knows as an inspirational symbol of peace? He may as well have played a paedophile for all the good it did him with casting directors.</p> <p>In the years immediately post-Gandhi, it was all high-gloss prestige. He had prestige enough to make you puke. He briefly became Harold Pinter's cinematic envoy, measuring out the writer's strategically-weighted words in two dead-from-the-brain-down movies, Betrayal (1983) and the winsome Turtle Diary (1985). There were bright spots where his implied benevolence was used in a sophisticated fashion, and twisted into comedy: he was a savvy Dr Watson to Michael Caine's bumbling Sherlock Holmes in Without a Clue (1988), and earned his second of four Oscar nominations as a hushed Meyer Lansky opposite Warren Beatty in Bugsy (1990). These peaks, and a brief return to the pinnacle of nobility and good taste in Schindler's List (1993), must have kept him nourished through the lean late-1990s. Did he close his eyes and think about Spielberg and Beatty to help him forget that, yes, he really was being directed by Michael Winner in Parting Shots (1998) and, yes, he was billed below Chris Rea?</p> <p>But there had been a flicker, during Roman Polanski's Death and the Maiden (1994), of something cruel. He played a respectable doctor suspected by Sigourney Weaver of being her former torturer; the inspired pairing of the itsy-bitsy Kingsley and the statuesque Weaver forced you to rethink your preconceptions about aggressors and victims. He sees much of his career in terms of exactly this kind of double-act \u2014 \"dances,\" he calls them. I point out that Sexy Beast falls into this category, with its warped courtship between Don and his old mucker Gal (Ray Winstone). \"Yes. It's a love story. I think Iago is in love with Othello. And I think Don loves Gal. Loves him. Like a soldier loves a general. These dynamics, to me, are everything. There's no film without them.\"</p> <p>Since Sexy Beast, he appears newly liberated. He can do anything now, from playing himself like some kind of minor, spoilt royalty dazed by riches in The Sopranos to carrying off a still and sober portrait of an Iranian immigrant in the otherwise overblown House of Sand and Fog. These days he is working more than ever, with roles in two other movies out this month beside The Wackness (Elegy and The Love Guru) and more to come, including the trainbound thriller Transsiberian, the comic satire War, Inc and Martin Scorsese's Shutter Island with Leonardo DiCaprio. Kingsley maintains that it's his inner peace, rather than anything connected with Sexy Beast, that has made him so in demand.</p> <p>\"Three or four years ago, I realized there was a demon I needed to be face to face with, so that I could say: 'You can go now. Thank you. You can go.' I felt this shift. Something had been clinging on. Some demon was sitting over me with a knife and fork, ready to eat me every day.\" He won't tell me what the demon was, only what it wasn't: \"It wasn't substances,\" he smiles. Did the demons leaving coincide with him meeting Daniela Barbosa de Carneiro, who became his fourth wife? \"The other way around. The demons left. Then the happiness came.\"</p> <p>Can he tell the difference between his work before the demons left, and now? \"I'm surprised I can't. Because I know I'm warmer, more embracing. I find my emotional triggers are closer to the surface, easier to reach. I don't have to dig too deep between 'action' and 'cut.' It's right there.\" He's jabbing at his chest with an insistent finger, and grinning madly.</p> <p>The Wackness is released 29 August.</p>",
  "<p>I love making-of documentaries. The best ones give you an insight into the nuts and bolts of film-making, a glimpse into what it takes to make a movie. But nowadays they are turning into vacuous promotional exercises. The bigger the picture, the more \"amazing\" the actors/ director/ atmosphere on set. Not much to learn there.<br> Thankfully there are new ways of heading behind-the-scenes, one of which has been pioneered by Pedro Almod\u00f3var. The great Spaniard is currently shooting his next movie, Los Abrazos Rotos (Broken Embraces) in Madrid, and for the past months, he has been <a href=\"www.pedroalmodovar.es\">blogging</a> about the preparations. It's a treat to read. <br> One of my favourite posts deals with <a href=\"http://www.pedroalmodovar.es/PAB_EN_03_T.asp\">finding the right hairdos</a> for Pen\u00e9lope Cruz's character. As Almod\u00f3var explains, she \"lives two very different, almost opposing, lives, that naturally must be characterized, among other things, by very different hairstyles\". One aspect of her character sees her \"pursued by fatality, a fighter with no luck, a fallen angel,\" the other as \"light, pop, na\u00efve, outrageous, exultant.\" <br> To represent this duality, Almod\u00f3var and Cruz try out different styles, from the wavy platinum bob to the Audrey Hepburn-style bun. Looking at the posted pictures, it's amazing to see the difference just swapping wigs can make. </p> <p>The director <a href=\"http://www.pedroalmodovar.es/PAB_EN_01FAbrazosRotos.asp\">invites us into his office</a>, where actors are rehearsing scenes - you see his desk, a wall of books behind. There he explains his faith in his actors, miles away from the Alfred Hitchcock approach. If you want to make a good movie, you must trust and nurture your cast, he says. \"[They are] what give me the greatest feeling of security when it comes to breathing life into this story.\" <br> Elsewhere the director explains how he sometimes <a href=\"http://www.pedroalmodovar.es/PAB_EN_05_T.asp\">talks to actors as he would talk to their characters</a>, or makes them relate to one another in character. It's \"something very Pirandello-like; the actors get inside their characters and talk among themselves with the only information to which they have access, that is, what I give them in the script. As well as being fun, it's a very good exercise for feeling that you are 'the other'.\" And it's good rehearsal practice before shooting.<br> In his latest post, Almod\u00f3var reveals his influences for <a href=\"http://www.pedroalmodovar.es/PAB_EN_07_T.asp\">Broken Embraces</a>, ranging from film noir to melodrama. \"We've finished the ninth week of shooting. These days we are tackling the darkest part of the film. The film touches on many genres. This week, it's the thriller. I admit that in recent years I've had a weakness for this genre. (And for the western, but I wouldn't know how to come to grips with a western).\"</p> <p>Almod\u00f3var reveals just enough information to keep you interested while cannily not revealing the whole plot. So to describe what Broken Embraces is about, Almod\u00f3var recalls Louis Malle's Lift to the Scaffold. \"At the end, when the characters of [Jeanne] Moreau and her unfortunate lover Maurice Ronet are cornered, condemned to live in different prisons, some photos appear of the couple in their good moments, embracing. <br> \"Jeanne Moreau's voiceover talks of those photographed embraces as something eternal, something that no one will be able to break and that will remain forever, while she will waste away in prison. My next film, Broken Embraces, talks about that kind of embrace.\"</p>",
  "<p>When the Olympic handover ceremony takes place in Beijing on Sunday, a TV audience of more than 100 million will marvel at a feat of strength, beauty and synchronicity every bit as impressive as anything they have seen in the swimming pool or gymnastics hall.</p> <p>For ZooNation, the British street-dance company that leads what promises to be an awe-inspiring performance complete with breakdancing, backflips and popping, it will be an opportunity to silence its critics. </p> <p>The announcement back in June that a multicultural urban dance group had been selected to represent Britain in the Olympic flag handover, which heralds the beginning of the London 2012 Olympiad, was met with horror and derision by certain sections of the press.</p> <p>\"Hip-hop hoodies, our Olympic envoys\", screamed the Daily Mail, \"Controversial dance act will take part in closing ceremony\", reported the Telegraph. \"London hoodies to pick up Olympic baton\", <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/jun/13/olympicgames2008.olympicgames2012\">the Guardian</a> sneered, and implied that the show ZooNation was then performing in the West End glamorised drug-dealing, pimps and gangsters. </p> <p><strong>Broadening narrow minds</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/jun/19/olympics2012.london\">Kate Prince</a>, the choreographer behind ZooNation, hit back at her detractors with the quip that her show Into the Hoods - an urban take on Stephen Sondheim's Into the Woods - was as much about gangster rap, drugs and pimps as the Sound of Music was about the Nazis.</p> <p>Meeting Prince three weeks before she was due to head out to Beijing, she was still disappointed and bemused by the furore. She could not understand why people seemed to find it hard to accept that the champion of a style of dance that emerged from the black US inner cities and won a following among <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/youngpeople\">urban youth</a> in the UK could be an \"English rose\" from the New Forest.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336757813\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Society/Pix/pictures/2008/08/19/5kate.jpg\" alt=\"ZooNation choreographer Kate Prince\" width=\"220\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">ZooNation choreographer Kate Prince. Photograph Graeme Robertson</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\"Journalists have been endlessly asking me: 'How does a white girl from the countryside end up doing something like this?'\" she sighs. \"I don't know how I got here. Street dance was something I became really passionate about and one step follows another and you arrive at something.\" But she is adamant that background should not be a prerequisite for doing a job. \"Saying I can't do this is like saying a black man from Hackney can't direct an opera. Anyone can do anything, aren't we past putting people in boxes?\" </p> <p>Prince, 33, took traditional ballet and tap lessons from the age of six to 12. But her destiny was set as an impressionable teenager watching pop videos.</p> <p>\"I saw Janet Jackson one day on MTV and that was the moment when I said I want to do that,\" she recalls. \"I know it sounds crap, but to me it was cool, everyone doing intricate, fast choreography.\" </p> <p>It wasn't until she went to Edinburgh University and choreographed the students' footlights that she was able to indulge her passion. One of her performances so impressed a London producer that she got a job on a West End musical. Prince describes herself as a \"cheesy musical theatrehead\". Her favourite film is Singin' in the Rain and her ambition was to combine musical theatre with a hip-hop style of dance to create a family show for the MTV generation.</p> <p>She travelled to New York and LA searching out classes in the latest street-dance techniques and taught them back in London. She gradually built a dance company with some of her best students, and in 2002 developed a piece called BoxBeat, loosely based around the story of children running away to a strange world where hip-hop characters came to life and taught them to dance. Six years later, this became Into the Hoods' Ruff Endz Estate, home to such characters as rapper MC Rap-on-Zel, struggling music producer Jaxx, who lives in the Basement, DJ Spinderella and her ugly sisters, Lil' Red, a singer who has just signed a deal with unscrupulous manager Wolf, and Giant, the drug dealer.</p> <p>ZooNation took its show to Edinburgh, where impresario Phil McIntyre spotted its star quality and put it on at the Novello Theatre on the Strand, where it became the West End's longest running dance show.</p> <p>It is a cliche to say that Prince plucked deprived youngsters from the inner cities and used dance to divert them from a life of crime. Her 12-strong company is predominantly made up of professional dancers, such as Jamaican-born Teneisha Bonner, 26, who was brought up in south-east London by her mother, and who did a three-year degree in dance theatre. Prince did, however, meet Bradley Charles, 15, on an outreach course she taught for Newham council. \"He's a bright sensible kid,\" she says of Charles. \"He was always going to be a success story.\" But other kids from the same east London project she remembers weren't so motivated. \"One went missing and two robbed a bank,\" she recalls. </p> <p>\"Everyone in ZooNation is there because they have worked hard, they have made good decisions, they have decided not to go down an avenue, but to be part of a team and try to do something with their lives,\" says Prince.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336757814\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Society/Pix/pictures/2008/08/19/4jeff.jpg\" alt=\"ZooNation dancer \" width=\"220\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A ZooNation dancer practices a routine. Photograph: ZooNation</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\"We love dancing, performing and making each other laugh, and we like working with young people,\" she says about ZooNation's origins. Yet a social mission quickly followed. \"We saw that it was about the bigger picture. We had the opportunity to get people into the theatre who previously would have had nothing but a negative image of hip-hop and young people, and to get them leaving with a smile on their face.\" </p> <p><strong>A social mission</strong></p> <p>Through its subsidised Saturday classes attended by 50 young people at the Urdang dance academy in Islington, north London, its youth company ZooYouth, and various outreach projects, ZooNation also tries to attract troubled youngsters to the thrill and discipline of dance. </p> <p>\"The power we have now is to go out and reach those who may not make the good decisions, may not have that opportunity,\" says Prince. \"I remember getting into trouble and running away when I was young just to get that adrenalin rush and bonding thing. If you're doing dance, you're not going out and robbing someone. You're too motivated, and knackered.\"</p> <p>\"I'm not saying dance is going to save the world,\" says Prince, \"but it will make a dent in the problem. And there are problems.\" </p> <p>ZooNation's participation in the Olympic handover will showcase the vibrant youth culture and multiculturalism that helped to secure London's bid to host the Games in 2012. Prince is hugely honoured that it will feature on the world stage alongside dancers from the Royal Ballet and CandoCo, a company that includes disabled dancers. But when we meet after top secret rehearsals for the big day, she says she would rather have spent the summer running workshops for disadvantaged young people across London. \"I've run out of hands and we don't have funding, but dance and music is such a beautiful gift, it can change how people feel about themselves.\"</p> <p>She is most excited about the potential of the Olympics to \"connect with young people\". \"You can do that with dance, sport and music,\" she says. She believes the government could help by putting more money into grassroots dance. </p> <p>\"I don't want to be quoted as an idiot who thinks if we all start dancing everything will be OK,\" Prince reiterates. \"But it will help. Unless someone's got a brighter idea?\"</p>",

The government moved to take control of Cemex's subsidiary after a 60-day period for negotiating compensation laid out in a June nationalisation decree by the president, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez.

A dozen fire trucks rushed to the scene, but only three were actively spraying hoses hours after the fire erupted, apparently due to water shortages. There was no official word on the cause of the fire. Evacuated employees said authorities had ruled out terrorism, and an electrical short-circuit had likely sparked the fire. <br><strong>Associated Press in Cairo</strong></p>",
  "<p>When Montana's governor, Brian Schweitzer, launched his campaign for re-election this summer he chose to be pictured on a horse lassooing a calf, and in silhouette against a barn door, presumably after a long hard day on the ranch. What was not mentioned was the word Democrat - a party affiliation that in some parts of the west still conjures up associations with gay marriage, gun control and abortion.</p> <p>Those sensibilities could be in for a shake-up as Barack Obama launches the Democrats' most aggressive drive for years for votes from the Rocky Mountain west.</p> <p>The strategy unrolling now across the west could turn once reliably Republican states such as Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, and possibly even Montana into America's new electoral battleground. But it is Colorado which is viewed as the biggest prize.</p> <p>\"Colorado defines competitive,\" said Dick Wadhams, the chairman of the state Republican party. \"I think either party could carry Colorado.\"</p> <p>It all hinges on how you define Democrat - a political label that has been comprehensively altered by a new generation of elected politicians in the west - and an impressive grassroots organisation now being assembled by the Obama campaign.</p> <p>The big push begins next week, when some 50,000 Democrats are expected to converge on Denver for the party's convention. Democrats see the convention, especially the spectacle surrounding Obama's nomination speech at a giant football stadium, as a chance to impress on voters in Colorado and other states the party's renewed commitment to the west.</p> <p>Obama's first appearances on his return from holiday this week were in Nevada and New Mexico, and he is planning to campaign in Colorado after the convention. \"Colorado and the west are both a big focus of this campaign,\" said Stephanie Mueller, a spokeswoman for the Obama campaign in Denver.</p> <p>Not that John McCain, the Republican candidate, is expected to yield easily. McCain has lived in Arizona for the last 25 years, and has made frequent visits to Colorado and Nevada.</p> <p>But after eight years of an unpopular George Bush, Democrats believe that voters in Colorado and other states are disillusioned with Republicans. They are frustrated with the rising deficit, the war in Iraq, and worried about the economy. This could be Obama's moment.</p> <p>Unlike previous elections, when the Republicans rode a wave of emotion over terrorism, or issues such as gay marriage and abortion, this time voters' concerns are down to earth: the economy and the need for renewable energy sources.</p> <p>That has led to a blurring of the conventional political divisions. In Colorado, unaffiliated voters outnumber Democrats and Republicans. Soaring petrol prices have turned conservative farmers into ardent conservationists. Even the Republican candidates have taken to carrying around solar film panels and using public transport to get to campaign events.</p> <p>The early signs are encouraging for Obama. The two candidates are virtually tied in Colorado, although a Rasmussen poll last week put McCain ahead of Obama in the state for the first time in seven months. McCain and Obama are also running neck and neck in Nevada and New Mexico.</p> <p>But Obama claims the edge in organising, grafting his campaign on top of rejuvenated local organisations.</p> <p>In every state of the west, the Obama campaign has taken the lead in voter registration, increasing the number of Democrats.</p> <p>In New Mexico, the campaign has opened 20 offices - compared to just five in the 2004 elections - and the organising effort has extended into rural areas that have not been involved in presidential contests for decades.</p> <p>In Colorado, Obama's campaign has opened 10 offices, including in towns seen as redoubts of the Christian right.</p> <p>Even in Montana, a state of 950,000, the campaign has deployed 40 paid organisers to register new voters.</p> <p>Wadhams insists that much of the excitement about Obama's organising prowess is over-stated. \"There is a lot of smoke and mirrors,\" he said.</p> <p>But Democrats across the west believe enthusiasm about Obama's candidacy and the campaign's investment in the region could make this the Democrats' moment.</p> <p>\"That investment and the energy that we see on the ground in New Mexico will absolutely translate in November,\" said Brian Col\u00f3n, the chairman of the New Mexico Democratic party.</p> <p>The challenge for Obama though will be to resist Republican efforts to brand him as an elitist, or a textbook liberal more at home in San Francisco or New York than in the west.</p> <p>For the last 40 years, the west has sent only Republicans to the White House - except for 1992 when Bill Clinton benefited from a third party candidate who drained Republican support. By 2000, Republicans governed all eight states, and controlled 13 of the 16 Senate seats.</p> <p>Then Democratic activists began to plot their comeback. In Colorado, local entrepreneurs began funnelling money towards liberal causes, building up institutions that could put Democrats on a surer footing. First came the thinktanks, then media monitoring organisations. By 2004, the local renewal efforts under way in Colorado and other states had a powerful patron in Howard Dean, the Democratic national committee chairman.</p> <p>Under Dean, the Democrats began putting money and resources into building up party networks even in states which had little prospect of voting a Democrat into the White House. Western Democrats credit the strategy with gaining a foothold for the party even in staunchly Republican states such as Utah and Wyoming, and say it will prove its value over the coming years.</p> <p>\"In a place like Montana there simply weren't the resources to keep a party headquarters opened during the entire year in non-election years and so it was very difficult,\" said Schweitzer. \"It kept people on the ground recruiting new candidates, maintaining voter files, making sure we have county committees that are working and organised.\"</p> <p>At the same time, the Democrats began recruiting a new generation of organisations, and began scouting for political candidates who could appeal to moderate voters in the west.</p> <p>Eight years on, five of the eight governors of western states are now Democrats, and five of the 16 senators.</p> <p>Betsy Markey, who is hoping to unseat a Christian right member of Congress in Colorado, has a simple formula for success that Obama might want to heed.

  "<p>As the alter ego of the reclusive billionaire Howard Hughes, Robert Maheu was the conduit through whom Hughes faced the world and bought up a string of Las Vegas casinos. According to Vegas lore, he helped Hughes \"rid the town of mob influence\", but Maheu, who has died aged 90, was a product of the intelligence community, closely connected to mafia figures. The same contacts and skills that proved invaluable to Hughes placed Maheu in the tangled webs surrounding both the assassination of President Kennedy and the Watergate break-in.</p> <p>Maheu (pronounced May-hew) was born in Waterville, Maine, to French-Canadian parents who ran a grocery business. After graduating from the College of the Holy Cross, Worcester, he left Georgetown University law school to join the wartime FBI as a translator. Given an identity as a Nazi-sympathising Canadian, he infiltrated New York's German-American Bund, passing disinformation to spies who were eventually arrested. After the war, and a brief spell with the Small Business Administration, he opened his own private investigative agency. He was soon put on a retainer by the fledgling CIA, where some of his former FBI colleagues had moved. He provided services to them while allowing the CIA to deny any link with him. His greatest success may have been scuttling, presumably through blackmail, Aristotle Onassis's attempt to obtain a monopoly on Saudi Arabia's oil shipping.</p> <p>In 1954, Maheu was hired to deal with a starlet attempting to blackmail Hughes after their relationship had soured. Hughes had him spy on other women too, including Ava Gardner, and to undertake industrial espionage, before asking him, in 1957, to become his public intermediary. \"Whenever I spoke, it was Howard Hughes speaking,\" Maheu recalled. However he never actually met his employer. </p> <p>When Maheu was hired to serve a subpoena on an elusive Las Vegas casino owner, the legendary Washington fixer Edward Bennett Williams introduced him to Johnny Roselli, the mob's frontman in Las Vegas. Maheu and Roselli became close friends, and, in 1960, when the CIA decided to use the mafia to try to assassinate Fidel Castro, they turned to Maheu. Maheu and Roselli brought the CIA together with mob bosses Sam Giancana and Santo Trafficante, who initiated the series of attempts on Castro's life. The conjunction of mobsters and CIA agents, disaffected after the failed Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba, in 1961, is often cited as the root of the many conspiracies to kill President Kennedy.</p> <p>Giancana hired Maheu to spy on his mistress, singer Phyllis McGuire, whom he suspected of having an affair with comedian Dan Rowan. When Maheu's operatives were caught in the act, they claimed they were worried McGuire would reveal \"national security\" secrets about the Castro plan. Roselli later confirmed the deal while plea-bargaining after his arrest for cheating members of Hollywood's Friars Club out of $400,000 in a crooked card game. This made Maheu's protestations that his country had \"thrown him in front of a bus\" when he testified at the Senate hearings in 1975 ring hollow, as both Giancana and Roselli were murdered before giving testimony.</p> <p>In 1966 Maheu moved to Las Vegas to work full-time for Hughes, who decided to buy the Desert Inn, rather than move out. Using the money from Hughes's sale of Trans World Airlines, he acquired more casinos, including the Sands, thus enabling Hughes to become Nevada's third-largest landowner. \"He was the King of Vegas,\" Maheu said, \"and as his surrogate, I wore the crown.\" </p> <p>It didn't last long. Maheu found himself at odds with the \"Mormon mafia\", corporate employees who surrounded Hughes. In 1970 he was fired, and Hughes was taken off to the Bahamas, never to return. When Clifford Irving's fake biography of Hughes appeared in 1972, Hughes held a telephone press conference to deny any connection with the book. He denounced Maheu as \"a no-good son of a bitch who robbed me blind\", and Maheu sued for defamation. He won a $2.8m judgment, overturned on appeal, and later settled out of court. </p> <p>Maheu served as Hughes's bagman, and among those who received cash was Richard Nixon's sidekick Bebe Rebozo. Hughes had also bailed out Nixon's brother Donald when his business failed in the 1950s. Nixon was worried this might be made public. In 1972, the Watergate burglars may have been looking to see if Democratic party head Larry O'Brien (one of Hughes's Washington lawyers) possessed incriminating evidence of illegal contributions from Hughes. Maheu claimed Hughes got him to offer both Presidents Lyndon Johnson and Nixon a million dollars if they would stop nuclear testing in the Nevada desert, a bribe both turned down.</p> <p>After his time with Hughes, Maheu returned to his detective agency and became one of Las Vegas's leading citizens. He died of cancer and congestive heart failure. His wife of 62 years, Yvette, died in 2003. He is survived by three sons; his daughter predeceased him.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Robert Aime Maheu, fixer, born October 30 1917; died August 4 2008</p>",
  "<p>Twelve days after they first rolled in, Russian tanks are still in Georgia and show no signs of pulling out. A small column left the strategic town of Gori yesterday, but Russian troops were still in the Black Sea port of Poti, taking 20 Georgian servicemen at gunpoint, and still encamped at Igoeti, 27 miles from the capital, Tbilisi. Nor is this likely to change. Having signed a ceasefire agreement which requires it to pull back to the position it occupied before the Georgian attack on Tskhinvali on August 7, Russia continues to dismantle Georgia's military machine. Russian forces have not only occupied the areas of South Ossetia which were previously under Georgian control but drilled a large \"security zone\" around the enclave, occupying villages like Igoeti which were wholly Georgian.</p> <p>Every day this occupation continues, Russia undermines its own case - which was to stop Georgia's ethnic cleansing of Ossetia. Every day Russian tanks rumble around Georgia, or greater Ossetia, is another day when Georgia's leaders claim that the real object of Russia's invasion is to dismember an independent and sovereign state. Dmitry Rogozin, Russia's ambassador to Nato, wrote in yesterday's International Herald Tribune that the Russian military did not \"subject civil objects and civilians on the territory of Georgia to deliberate attacks\". There are countless smouldering Georgian villages that say otherwise.</p> <p>All of which obscures Georgia's historic aim to seize its breakaway provinces back by force. Georgia's previous attempts to solve its separatist conflicts with tanks and bombardments (they did it to South Ossetia in 1990-92 and Abkhazia in 1992-93) are glossed over by those who cast this conflict as a demonstration of Russian imperialism. Zviad Gamsakhurdia, Georgia's first post-Soviet president, claimed Ossetians only appeared in Georgia on the coat-tails of the Red Army's invasion in 1921. Georgia's current president, Mikheil Saakashvili, said in an interview with the BBC that the only Russian citizens in South Ossetia were the ones that Russia had just created by handing out passports. Each Georgian leader peddles the same myth, which is to deny Ossetians or the Abkhaz their history, identity and land.</p> <p>Widen the field of vision, and what happened in South Ossetia could be repeated and amplified in the Crimea, a pro-Russian enclave that has always disputed its inclusion into Ukraine. Pull back the lens still further, and there are more than 8 million ethnic Russians in Ukraine, and 1.2 million in the Baltic states, where they are significant minorities in the populations of Estonia and Latvia. Old memories die hard. Last year a man was killed in a Russian demonstration in Tallinn after the Estonian authorities moved a Soviet-era war memorial. When former Baltic leaders write that Europe must stand up to Russia, what does that mean for sizable portions of their own populations? Sovereignty is not the only principle at stake. How successfully independent states cope with the legacy of their history also matters.</p> <p>There was no international settlement when the Soviet Union broke up. The map could easily be redrawn again, and it is in no one's interests that it is done either by Russian tanks or by western security guarantees. Nato's eastward expansion must not only be judged by the benefits enjoyed by its new members, but by the reaction it causes elsewhere. It may have just shifted the line of confrontation eastwards. Without Russia's participation, Nato's ability to solve conflict in the Caucasus is limited. Its ability to spread it, however, is unlimited. Nato's decision yesterday to create a special consultative council for Georgia, and to suspend the one it has with Russia, may appear today to be a useful diplomatic lever. But in the long term the exclusion of Russia from the collective security arrangements of a region where millions of ethnic Russians live is a recipe for conflict.</p>",
  "<p>Christine Ohuruogu, who last night won Britain's first Olympic 400m gold medal since Eric Liddell in 1924, admitted that she had run the race blind. \"I had a race plan but as usual it went out the window,\" she said \"I was in my own world. People said 'Did you know Sanya [Richards] had gone off very hard?' but she was in lane seven and I couldn't see her. </p> <p>\"All I had to work off was the Russian girl outside me who I knew would go off very hard, and at 200 metres I was annoyed with myself that I had left myself too much work.\" </p> <p>In fact the 24-year-old Londoner timed her performance to perfection, charging through in the final 30m to beat the American superstar Sanya Richards and add the Olympics to her world and Commonwealth crowns. But Ohuruogu, who was in Beijing after winning her appeal against the British Olympic Association's lifetime ban after three missed drug tests, is unsure if she will run at the London 2012 Games which take place a couple of miles from her family home.</p> <p>\"It's something I have given thought to but it's a long way away,\" she said. \"The Olympics will be 15 minutes from where my parents live, that is where I was brought up, where I have lived all my life. It would be great if I could say I will be there, but you have take each year as it comes.\"</p> <p>Ohuruogu had been tipped to become the face of 2012 after she won the Commonwealth Games title in Melbourne two years ago. But her life was turned upside down when she was suspended, for 12 months, for missing the tests. She returned last year summer in spectacular fashion to win the world title in Osaka and has now joined Britain's greatest female athletes with this magnificent run. </p> <p>She becomes only the fourth British woman to win an Olympic track gold medal alongside Ann Packer, who won the 800m in 1964, Sally Gunnell, who won the 400m hurdles in 1992, and Dame Kelly Holmes, who triumphed in the 800m and 1500m in Athens four years ago. </p> <p>After Ohuruogu won in Osaka, Sebastian Coe, the chairman of London 2012, said: \"She could be one of our ambassadors but we have never discussed anyone being the face of 2012.\" Coe was part of the presentation party here, handing Ohuruogu her flowers on the podium. \"He [Seb] was really happy,\" she said. \"It's been a great British Olympics. I did not have nightmares that I would never be here.\" </p> <p>Her coach, Lloyd Cowan, was in no doubt that she should be used for 2012. \"If you can't sell that then what is the London Games about?\" Cowan said after watching his charge storm to victory in the Bird's Nest Stadium. \"Maybe the face is not the one you want to see, but if you can't sell the Olympic, world and Commonwealth champion, then what does that say about London and what we are doing?\" </p> <p>Cowan attributed her victory to strength of body and mind. \"What she does is not easy. But she has huge mental strength when it counts. People say bad things about you because they want to bring you down, and she has had to go through that for a whole year,\" he said. \"How would you feel if you ended up in prison, you have been released and you are trying to do your honest day's work and people keep bringing up the past? </p> <p>\"But we cannot control what people think. We do our job and people judge us on that job. We invest in all sorts of athletes but she delivers. The bottom line is that we get there and we perform.\" </p> <p>As a double winner of the Golden League and having beaten Ohuruogu three times last year, Richards was the favourite . She led from the start last night, but ran out of steam as Ohuruogu was reaching full power. The Briton won in 49.62sec - 0.01sec outside the personal-best time she ran in the final in Osaka. Proof, if more were needed, of her ability to save her best for when it matters.</p>",
  "<p>Hicham Yezza (Britain's terror laws have left me and my family shattered, August 18) raises forcefully the question of why there has been only moderate opposition to the erosion of habeas corpus. I fear that one reason is that detention has so far been used only or mainly against Muslims, perceived by many as a homogeneous, distinct group and one which can be often conveniently identified by their names. This feeds the dangerous illusion \"it couldn't happen to me\", always the first step in a slide towards authoritarian rule. A law which allows innocent people to be detained on the flimsiest of evidence not only shames those who passed it, but threatens all of us and risks turning the police from protectors into bullies. <br><strong>Margaret Dickinson</strong><br>London </p> <p>The story of Hicham Yezza's arrest is in every way disgraceful, but a particularly strange point about it is the authorities' apparent conviction that merely studying al-Qaida pronouncements is in itself an offence. If we do not study these things, how are we supposed to understand them? Without understanding, how can we deal with them? Both Yezza and his friend were obviously qualified students of such matters, people whose interest in them deserved high praise and encouragement, not punishment. Arresting people like these will naturally tend to keep others away from those essential studies. And that will surely have a bad effect on our national security.<br><strong>Mary Midgley</strong><br>Newcastle upon Tyne</p>",
  "<p>Children from the poorest homes are being systematically failed in their education because their schools are not receiving the funding needed to properly support them, new research suggests. </p> <p>Figures obtained by the End Child Poverty campaign reveal that in vast areas of the country fewer than one in eight of children who receive free school meals leaves school with five good GCSEs, including English and maths. Across England half of children reach that target but for the 14% of children who qualify for free lunches that figure stands at just 21%.</p> <p>The research shows London bucking that national trend because of extra money it receives through the London Challenge programme to support struggling secondaries. </p> <p>Tomorrow's GCSE results are expected to show another rise in the pass rate with the proportion receiving A* and As edging towards 20%. But there are concerns that this is being fuelled by improvements in private and high-performing state schools rather than comprehensives in the poorest areas, which are falling behind. This year's GCSE students are the first to be educated solely under New Labour.</p> <p>The End Child Poverty figures show that in Barnsley just 10% of children on free school meals get five good GCSEs including English and maths. The top 20 performing areas in terms of the GCSE success rate for children from the poorest homes are dominated by London boroughs which have received London Challenge support. </p> <p>John Dunford, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: \"London Challenge has been very successful. It tells us that additional resources and improvement strategies need to be precisely targeted if schools are to receive the right kind of support to raise achievement and in particular to narrow the achievement gap between rich and poor.\"</p> <p>He said the government's new National Challenge scheme to target underperforming secondaries across the country did not currently stand to expand the same resources and support that London Challenge had provided in the capital. </p> <p>Hilary Fisher, director of the Campaign to End Child Poverty, said: \"It is unacceptable that children have the odds stacked against them simply by default of having poorer parents. The government must put its money where its mouth is and end child poverty so that all children, no matter their background, have equal chances to achieve a decent education.\"</p> <p>Separate research today from the TUC shows how growing inequality in Britain is damaging the prospects of children from poorer families. Using international data, it found children's wellbeing was more affected by the extent of inequality in a society than by average incomes. Children in the least equal nations had poorer health and educational attainment.</p> <p>The TUC said the number of children living in poverty in Britain had fallen since 1997, but the inequality gap between the top 10th of the population and the bottom 10th had grown. Pre-tax incomes of the richest 10th increased by 41% over the Labour government's first eight years, compared with 26% for the poorest 10th. </p> <p>Andrew Adonis, the schools minister, said: \"At GCSE the gap in achievement between children from poorer and more affluent backgrounds is narrowing and results for children on free school meals are rising faster than the average. Since 2002 the percentage of pupils on free school meals achieving five or more A*-C grades at GCSE has risen by 12.5 percentage points, in comparison with 9.1 percentage points for pupils not on free school meals.\"</p>",
  "<p>A British man and his eight-year-old daughter have died in a crash in Turkey after the driver of their vehicle reportedly had water squirted into his eyes and lost control of the vehicle.</p> <p>Jonathan Pearce, 38, and his daughter Charley, from the West Midlands, were on a First Choice holiday with six other members of their family, who were all travelling in the same open topped 4x4 when it crashed into a tractor. Pearce's eight-year-old nephew, Joseph, was said to be in a critical but stable condition after Monday's crash. </p> <p>The 4x4 was in a convoy of four vehicles that were taking part in a safari, organised by a local company, Sarigerme Tours. They were returning the tourists to their holiday village in Sarigerme, on the south-west coast of Turkey, when the accident happened. </p> <p>The holidaymakers had been having water pistol fights between the vehicles but the crash happened when another passing tourist joined in, according to others travelling in the convoy.</p> <p>One eyewitness, who asked not to be named, told a local news agency: \"It was dreadful, really dreadful. One minute they were all laughing and squirting each other with water pistols. It was a long straight stretch of road and the tractor had broken down at the side. </p> <p>\"We didn't see it happen but we were told that the driver, a young lad, was squirted with water, which temporarily blinded him. He saw the tractor too late and swerved to avoid it but as he swerved the back of the jeep took the full impact of the crash. They were standing up in the jeep having a whale of a time. When they hit the tractor I saw them being flung out into the road \"</p> <p>The eyewitness said no one in the 4x4 had been wearing a seatbelt. The other vehicles reversed back and people tried to help the victims. They covered up Charley because she was \"obviously dead\". </p> <p>The injured were taken to the Yucelen hospital, in Mugla, an hour away, where father-of two Pearce, whose wife Joanne was also in the 4x4, died of his injuries. </p> <p>Of the 10 passengers in the vehicle, eight were from the Pearce family. Charley's uncle, Joseph Pearce, and her cousin Stephan, six, were treated for cuts, bruises and shock before being released. Another British man, Chan Singh, who had been in the same vehicle with his wife, was also taken to hospital, although the Foreign Office in London said he had suffered only minor injuries.</p> <p>A Foreign Office spokeswoman said she understood that the driver of the 4x4 vehicle had been detained. Police at the nearby station of Ortaca confirmed they were looking for a German motorbike tourist who had allegedly thrown water at the vehicle. </p> <p>A spokesman for Sarigerme Tours said staff were \"very, very sad\" at the tragic accident and that the company had never had an accident previously in five years of running 4x4 safaris. </p> <p>\"Four jeeps went out on the safari. Three of them had passed the broken down tractor. But as the fourth jeep came down the road a German motorbike tourist thought he'd join in the fun and threw water at the jeep. </p> <p>\"It hit the driver in the face and temporarily blinded him. He swerved to avoid the tractor but the back of our vehicle hit the [tractor's] trailer and the passengers were thrown out.\"</p> <p>A relative in the West Midlands, who did not wish to be identified, said the rest of the family had only found about the accident yesterday and were completely distraught. \"It is all too soon and still raw at the moment to say anything else.\"</p> <p>A First Choice spokeswoman said it was \"a deeply sad time\" and the company wished to express its heartfelt sympathy to the family and friends of those killed. She said resort staff were offering support and assistance to the rest of the family and emphasised that the safari organiser was not affiliated to First Choice. </p> <p>A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: \"We can confirm that two British nationals died and seven were injured in a road traffic accident whilst on a jeep safari in Turkey yesterday.\"</p> <p>She added that the family were receiving consular advice.</p>",
  "<p>Britain's biggest police force will this week be plunged into crisis after one of its own leaders sues, alleging he was the victim of racial discrimination. Assistant commissioner Tarique Ghaffur, third most senior officer at Scotland Yard, is expected to issue employment tribunal proceedings that heap fresh pressure on Sir Ian Blair, the Metropolitan police commissioner.</p> <p>Senior sources close to both men have told the Guardian that the feud between the two leaders of British policing has been fermenting for years and has been barely concealed.</p> <p>Late in 2004, after it was announced that Blair would become the commissioner of the Met, colleagues dropped in to his Scotland Yard office to congratulate him. One of those well-wishers was Brian Paddick, then a senior Met officer. Paddick said Blair, then the deputy commissioner, commented: \"Brian, I don't know what I'll do if Tarique becomes my deputy.\"</p> <p>Ghaffur applied for the deputy job, but did not get it. For four years the enmity between Blair and Ghaffur has grown. </p> <p>Never before has so senior an officer been in such open rebellion against his force, and Ghaffur is now threatening to reveal embarrassing secrets about the Met.</p> <p>His employment tribunal claim will allege the commissioner was involved in Scotland Yard's investigation into whether the Labour government traded peerages for cash. The Met's commissioner has claimed to have had no involvement.</p> <p>Already sources close to the commissioner say they believe Ghaffur's allies are behind corruption allegations that have left Blair facing a formal inquiry over the awarding of \u00a33m worth of contracts to a friend. Ghaffur has collected hundreds of documents which, his allies say, will support his various claims.</p> <p>Allegations have also been made against Ghaffur. Since he let it be known in June that he was consulting lawyers, his private life has been trashed by two newspapers. His allies suspected the Met was involved.</p> <p>Sources on each side agree over Ghaffur's career prospects in the Met after 33 years as an officer. \"He's finished,\" two senior sources told the Guardian.</p> <p>A question many in government and the Met ask is how the commissioner, who took office promising to be a champion of diversity, ended up being accused of leading a racist force by the country's most senior Asian officer and one of the high-profile Muslims in British public life.</p> <p>Ghaffur joined the Met in 1999, after rising to become deputy chief constable in Lancashire. After two years Ghaffur angered senior white colleagues, including Blair, over the case of Ali Dizaei who was a rising star in the Met and fierce critic of the police over race.</p> <p>Both sides privately agree the direct feud between Ghaffur and Blair goes back to the case of Dizaei.</p> <p>Dizaei, then a superintendent, was subjected to a huge \u00a34m covert investigation which ended with his standing trial in 2003 on corruption charges. He was acquitted. Blair, who at the time was deputy commissioner, was in charge of the anti-corruption unit that pursued Dizaei. </p> <p>As early as 2001 it was privately known that Blair would land the job of Met commissioner, barring any mishap. The Dizaei case almost derailed his plans.</p> <p>Ghaffur, by then an assistant commissioner, gave evidence that many in the Met blamed for collapsing their case and helping Dizaei towards acquittal. Ghaffur told the jury Dizaei had been the victim of a witch-hunt. Dizaei was acquitted because the investigation into him spiralled out of control and produced no evidence of wrongdoing a jury would believe.</p> <p>Paddick said Ghaffur's testifying for Dizaei would have angered Blair: \"I don't think it is something Ian Blair has ever forgotten.\"</p> <p>Senior colleagues were enraged by his actions. A senior Met source said: \"It was a devastating blow to the case. Ian Blair was utterly furious with Tarique; he had no notice Tarique would do that and it was clearly damaging. It was at a critical time when Blair was launching his bid for commissioner.\"</p> <p>But as the dust cleared it emerged the Met had \"spied\" on Ghaffur. As undercover officers tailed Dizaei, recording his every move, they also taped his meetings with Ghaffur, his mentor. The Met claimed the spying on one of its most senior officers was accidental. </p> <p>Ghaffur, who was given the codename \"Vivaldi\" by the undercover team, believes his own force deliberately spied on him in an attempt to dig up dirt. He will claim he was also excluded from meetings about the Dizaei case while more junior officers were allowed to attend. </p> <p>Ghaffur moved on and set up a new unit tackling the most difficult crimes, the serious crime directorate. The unit would demonstrate his policing abilities and also be the issue on which he clashed again publicly with Blair and over which he very nearly got the sack.</p> <p>SCD tackled homicides and the upper end of crime. Ghaffur pioneered ways of working with communities and developed and led a unit that even his critics conceded was groundbreaking. Paddick said: \"He delivered excellent results. He did in the end win people round.\"</p> <p>But in 2006 the Met, now led by Blair, wanted to cut SCD's budget to spend on other areas of policing. Ghaffur, who was part of the Met's inner cabinet known as the management board, took a step unheard of in modern policing; he publicly threatened his own employer with legal action to try to stop the budget cuts.</p> <p>A senior Met source said: \"It would be seen as directly attacking the authority of the commissioner and cabinet [collective] responsibility.\"</p> <p>A senior source said: \"He came very close to not having his contract renewed ... he was saved by the commissioner and MPA losing their bottle. \"</p> <p>The public defiance led to Ghaffur being stripped of leading SCD and sent off to head the central operations unit, dealing with firearms and traffic. It was a redeployment meant to signal clearly to him that he was on the way out. A senior source said: \"By the time he [arrived at the unit] he was already in the last-chance saloon.\"</p> <p>Latterly Ghaffur has tried to become a chief constable of either the West Midlands, West Yorkshire or Greater Manchester force. He was unhappy at being moved to central operations, but when London was chosen to host the 2012 Olympics he was put in charge of the games' security. However, eventually the government decided the Met should not be running security, and put a Home Office official in charge.</p> <p>Ghaffur feels this was further evidence of his being undermined, and he will also claim to have been excluded from meetings about the Olympics.</p> <p>But was it racism or just the political nature of the top of British policing that saw Ghaffur's ambitions thwarted?</p> <p>One senior source with close knowledge of the Met said: \"Tarique has added value to the force, but he's reached his limit and does not realise that. I realise that I've reached my limit. He's brilliant at some things, but just doesn't realise his weaknesses.\"</p> <p>Ghaffur's issuing of formal legal proceedings will mean that the top six ethnic minority officers in the Met have all sued or are suing the force for racial discrimination. </p> <p>In 1999 the Met was found to be institutionally racist by a public inquiry and it has been trying ever since to prove otherwise. Ethnic minority officers, headed by Ghaffur, believe the force is still prejudiced.</p> <p>Lee Jasper, a former adviser on race and police to the former mayor of London Ken Livingstone, knows Blair and Ghaffur well and is a fan of both. He says that the impact of Ghaffur suing could be serious: \"The effect will be disastrous. It represents a real setback for their race equality efforts internally.\"</p>",
  "<p>The chair of Woolworths yesterday accused would-be bidder Malcolm Walker of megaphone diplomacy in his attempt to win control of the struggling retail chain - but made it clear he was still open to offers.</p> <p>Richard North suggested the boss of the Iceland frozen-food chain had leaked his plans to the media rather than conduct conventional, private discussions. </p> <p>It emerged at the weekend that Walker had sent a bid proposal to Woolworths at the end of July offering to pay \"tens of millions\" of pounds for the ailing variety stores. Walker made it clear he did not want Woolworths' more profitable businesses - the music and books distributor EUK or its DVD venture with the BBC.</p> <p>Walker is backed by Icelandic retail investor Baugur, who also back his Iceland chain and are Woolworths' second biggest shareholder with a 10% stake. Woolies rejected the bid after an emergency board meeting on Sunday, branding it unacceptable on the basis that it undervalued the assets, would leave all pension liabilities with Woolworths and could undermine its funding arrangements.</p> <p>Yesterday North revealed that he had started to take steps to package the chain for a possible sale last October and that Walker had first made contact to suggest a takeover of the 815-strong store chain some six weeks ago.</p> <p>North visited Walker at his London home in Sloane Square to discuss details. Walker requested more information and North agreed to it if Walker signed a confidentiality agreement. North prepared this and sent it to Walker, but heard nothing. North then contacted Walker and says he was told the Iceland boss no longer needed the information and was working on assembling bid finance.</p> <p>North had intended to contact the board about the bid this week but the full details were leaked to a Sunday paper, prompting the hasty board meeting and Woolworths' rejection. North said one of the biggest issues with Walker's planned bid was that he didn't want to take on any existing pension liabilities, even for existing employees. \"There is no way we could be liable for maintaining a pension fund for employees of someone else,\" he said.</p> <p>In preparing to make the chain saleable, he added, the Woolworths' pension-fund trustee had been asked how big a cash injection would be demanded. North yesterday refused to say exactly how much the fund wanted, but said it was more than Walker was offering for the retail chain - which is understood to be \u00a350m. On those grounds, he said, the offer was \"bizarre\".</p> <p>North said he was open to \"any sensible offers\", but would talk \"only privately\" and he had not been able to contact Walker: \"He is on a yacht in the Caribbean and I gather the reception is not very good\".</p> <p>Woolworths shares closed at 6.76p, down 0.63p. They have collapsed by more than 70% in the past year.</p>",

According to Afghan officials, four of the soldiers were executed after being captured or \"kidnapped\" during a two-day running battle with more than 100 insurgents. </p> <p>President Nicolas Sarkozy was due to arrive in Afghanistan this morning to show troops that \"France was by their sides\". The casualties were mostly from France's 8th parachute regiment, recently arrived as part of a controversial reinforcement of the French presence in Afghanistan ordered by Sarkozy earlier this year. </p> <p>Elsewhere, a team of suicide bombers attempted to storm American and Afghan national army (ANA) bases near the eastern city of Khost, the second major assault on the positions in 24 hours. </p> <p>In the past three days, more than 100 people have died during fighting and bombings around the country. \"We had an OK winter and a good spring but we are having a tough summer,\" said one official from the International Security Assistance Force (Isaf) in Afghanistan.</p> <p>The French casualties appear to have come after a joint Isaf and Afghan army patrol was ambushed on Monday afternoon in the Spir Kundi district of Kabul province, 20 miles north-east of the town of Sorobi, a strategic bottleneck on the crucial road linking the capital to the city of Jalalabad, near the Pakistani border. </p> <p>Fighting continued overnight and into yesterday morning, though local officials said that the clash was over by early afternoon. Abdul Wahed, a provincial councillor from Sorobi, said the fighting yesterday had lasted three or four hours.</p> <p>The French force was backed up by air strikes and Afghan army troops. Afghan officials said that three Afghan soldiers had been injured and dozens of Taliban militants killed. \"Recently Isaf and ANA [forces were] deployed into the area and started going on patrol. This was their third patrol and it came under attack yesterday afternoon and it lasted several hours. There were [coalition] air bombardments but it is an uninhabited area so we have no reports of civilian casualties,\" Qazi Suleiman, the Spir Kundi chief, said. </p> <p>The deaths will cause uproar in France. Sarkozy has taken French foreign policy in a more pro-Washington direction than his predecessor Jacques Chirac and has stressed France's commitment to the military and reconstruction effort in Afghanistan. European nations have been under increasing pressure from the US to contribute more combat troops to contain the Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan. </p> <p>Since 2002, the French have contributed 1,000 men to the Isaf force patrolling Kabul but the new troops were the first to be committed to combat operations, other than small detachments of special forces. </p> <p>The deployment was originally planned for south Afghanistan where fighting has been fiercest. Before this latest incident, 14 French soldiers had been killed since their initial deployment. Overall, 176 foreign soldiers have been killed this year. </p> <p>Accounts of the Khost incident differ. However, Arsala Jamal, the governor of Khost province, said 10 suicide bombers had been killed along with an Afghan army soldier. Jamal described a complex and ambitious operation involving two waves of attacks late on Monday night and again yesterday morning with teams of bombers backed by conventional fighters. </p> <p>\"Militarily this was very stupid,\" he said. \"The Taliban wanted to show off to the world with a spectacular strike.\" </p> <p>Kabul has seen a huge security operation in recent days aimed at preventing an attack on yesterday's Afghanistan independence day. But the problem merely seems to have been displaced. The plateaux and valleys to the north and east of Kabul have become increasingly problematic in recent months with growing numbers of attacks on convoys on the road to Jalalabad. In one incident last week near Sorobi, insurgents stopped traffic on the road and torched coalition fuel tankers. </p> <p>The lightly armed Taliban have often suffered heavy casualties whenever they have risked a formal engagement with western troops. But a Taliban spokesman yesterday claimed that the insurgents had inflicted \"heavy losses\" on such troops. </p> <p>\"This morning we ambushed Nato troops in Sorobi district using mines and rockets. We destroyed five vehicles,\" Zabihullah Mujahed told the AFP agency. </p> <p>Taliban spokesmen routinely exaggerate numbers or fabricate claims of civilian casualties. But the loss of the French troops will hand a major propaganda victory to the insurgents as will the proximity of their attack to the capital. The engagement is the first major clash to take place within Kabul province. Last week an attack on aid workers in Logar province and strikes on convoys in Wardak province, south of the capital, revealed the growing presence the Taliban has been able to establish in areas previously considered under Afghan government control.</p> <h2>'We are resolved to fight terror'</h2> <p>Nicolas Sarkozy yesterday insisted France remained committed to its military presence in Afghanistan as opposition figures condemned a deployment which saw the French army suffering its heaviest losses in 25 years.</p> <p>Paying tribute to the 10 men who died in yesterday's ambush, President Sarkozy said that, while France had been \"hit hard\" by the attack, his determination for French troops to remain part of the Nato force in Afghanistan was \"intact\". </p> <p>\"France is resolved to fight terror for democracy and for freedom,\" he said, announcing his intention to fly to Kabul last night. \"The cause is just and it is the honour of France and of her military to defend it.\"</p> <p>But the deaths - the biggest loss of life suffered by the French army since a bombing in Lebanon in 1983 - were used as an example by the opposition Socialist party to highlight the need for a national debate. \"What are the aims of this war? How many troops must there be to reach its stated objectives?\" said a statement from the party leader, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande. </p> <p>The French government faced its first vote of no-confidence earlier this year when Sarkozy's move to send hundreds of extra troops to Afghanistan was greeted with dismay by the opposition and members of his own right-wing UMP. </p> <p>Opinion polls have consistently shown that the majority of the population opposes military engagement in the country and yesterday political websites were flooded with angry comments from Sarkozy's critics. </p> <p>\"There are families suffering who must be cursing Sarko for having sent young guys out there to act the big guy in front of his friend Bush,\" read one comment on Le Monde's political blog. \"Without Sarkozy's political choice these men would still be with us,\" said another on Le Figaro's website.</p>",
  "<p>Fifteen years ago the music world was turned upside down with the release of Liz Phair's album, Exile in Guyville. Written in response to the Rolling Stones' Exile on Main Street (both were double albums, 18 tracks long), it matched that record in grandeur, ambition and achievement and quickly attracted a stream of superlatives. </p> <p>The praise has continued with the album's re-release this summer, and Phair's performance of it in its entirety at a string of US concerts. In fact, as the Village Voice recently noted: \"It's near impossible to overstate Exile's importance as an astonishingly honest, influential, genre-busting exercise.\" </p> <p>Phair's debut was a revolution for women listeners in particular. A mix of indie rock, power pop and folk, Exile attracted attention for its sexually frank content and confessional nature, and amid all its talk of blow jobs, fucking and running, there was also an emotional openness that brought a vulnerability to Phair's swagger. The same woman who sang \"Every time I see your face/I think of things unpure unchaste/I want to fuck you like a dog/I'll take you home and make you like it\" also spoke with a pang of romantic longing. \"I want all that stupid old shit,\" she admitted, \"like letters and sodas.\" </p> <p>\"I am a feminist, and I define myself,\" Phair said at the time. \"Be yourself, because if you can get away with it, that is the ultimate feminist act.\" And perhaps more than anything, Exile in Guyville provided an introduction to feminism for a generation of young women who had assumed the battle had been fought by their mothers, but found that they needed a new form of feminism to address not only the persistent social imbalances, but also issues such as the expression of sexuality. It was, if you like, third-wave feminism with a beat. </p> <p>Shayla Thiel-Stern of the University of Minnesota recently reflected, \"The album made it OK for us (girls) to talk explicitly about sexuality in terms that only guys were allowed to use, and it made it fine to acknowledge both the vulnerability as well as the fun and vulgar aspects of sexuality, even if it was in the form of singing along.\" Other commentators have testified to Guyville's importance in their feminist awakening. At Salon.com, for instance, writer Kate Harding declared Guyville \"the album that made me a feminist.\"</p> <p>Phair wasn't the only woman writing confessional songs in the 1990s; it was a time when this form of songwriting flourished. A year before Exile in Guyville came Little Earthquakes, the debut album by Tori Amos, which was marked by its emotionally cathartic quality. Notably, it included her first single, Me and a Gun, which dealt with Amos's own rape at the age of 21: \"Yes I wore a slinky red thing, does that mean I should spread/ For you, your friends, your father, Mr Ed?\" It was Little Earthquakes, and Me and a Gun in particular, that shifted the tone of women's songwriting, and convinced record companies that there was a market for confessional albums. </p> <p>A few years later came Alanis Morissette's Jagged Little Pill, a sheeny take on the genre that received relentless radio airplay, but, like Little Earthquakes, was fuelled by a desire to articulate a woman's feelings in the wake of a physical attack. Not long before recording, Morissette had been robbed at gunpoint in LA, an episode that led to panic attacks, hospital visits and therapy. Like Guyville, Morissette's album was characterised by an emotional and sexual frankness (\"Are you thinking of me when you fuck her?\" was the lyric of note) which proved no barrier to commercial success. It went on to be the biggest-selling album of the 1990s in the US. </p> <p>There were others too, both before and after, who pursued this confessional mode of song-writing: Fiona Apple, Ani DiFranco, Juliana Hatfield, Lisa Loeb and Heather Nova all rose to prominence in the 1990s. Before them came Patti Smith, Kate Bush, Suzanne Vega, Carole King, Carly Simon, Dory Previn and Laura Nyro. These artists offered up emotional honesty and spoke of subjects not often addressed by mainstream popular culture - the wish to be viewed as something other than wives and mothers, of frustration, sexual desire, the pain of desertion, rape, abortion and motherhood, masturbation and menstruation.</p> <p>Of course, confessional songwriting has existed in some form for centuries, but it was the arrival of female singer-songwriters such as Joan Baez and Buffy Sainte-Marie in the 60s who paved the way directly for an artist like Phair. As Dr Peter Mills, senior lecturer in media and popular culture at Leeds Metropolitan University, says, these singers \"located emotional responses that weren't being articulated by [songs like] Jimmy Mack\". Crucially, they began to shift the focus away from songs about being boy-crazy or having traditional ambitions such as getting married, to exploring women's own emotional desires. Mills regards singer-songwriters of the early 70s such as Carole King and Carly Simon as a \"bridge\" between girl groups like the Supremes and the thrust of Phair's generation. \"King grew up writing the boy-centric songs in the Brill Building [the New York office building famously used by music publishers and writers],\" he explains, \"but she also embodied the barefooted female singer-songwriter.\" Carly Simon, too, helped to alter the vocabulary of songwriting. \"With the exception of You're So Vain, which is about the peacockery of maledom, her early records are very loving,\" says Mills, \"but her songs were not especially saucer-eyed, they're very realistic and mature.\" </p> <p>The year of 1971 saw the release of three phenomenally important albums by female artists - Carole King's Tapestry (also re-released next month), Carly Simon's self-titled debut, and Dory Previn's Mythical Kings and Iguanas. All enjoyed considerable success, but while King and Simon are still feted today, Previn is strangely overlooked. Like King, Previn had trained as a lyricist, though she was employed to write film music rather than pop songs. When she embarked upon a career as a solo artist, beginning with On My Way to Where in 1970, she set out the stall of the confessional songwriting that we would see over the next four decades. Much of that first album dealt with her time in a psychiatric hospital and the breakdown of her marriage to the composer Andr\u00e9 Previn, but there were also references to her difficult relationship with her father and allusions to fantasies of incest. Mythical Kings and Iguanas dwelled less in the past, and focused on a woman's desire for a relationship, along with physical and emotional abuse and being involved with a younger man.</p> <p>\"She hasn't quite had her time yet,\" Mills says of Previn. \"The same could be said of Laura Nyro, and Judee Sill. The language they use doesn't have the rage of Alanis or Liz Phair or PJ Harvey, but there's still some of that matching of rage to articulacy, and that's unusual in pop.\"</p> <p>One of the key areas that these women singer-songwriters sought to articulate, particularly in the 90s, was female sexual experience. Mills notes that the explicitness of Phair et al was not unprecedented; lately, he says, he has been listening to a compilation of women's songs called Sugar in My Bowl: Vintage Sex Songs 1923-1952. \"There's one called Hot Nuts,\" he laughs. \"You could not play that on the radio now! It's incredibly filthy. So it's not as if it hadn't been expressed before Liz Phair.\" In fact the arrival of Madonna in the early 1980s had done much to alter the expected image of women pop stars, as well as to expand the vocabulary of feminine pop. \"But the appeal [of Phair] was that frankness,\" adds Mills. \"A lot of pop music is sold on its candour, but it's rarely as candid as Guyville. It opened up the expressive vocabulary for female artists.\"</p> <p>It's interesting to explore why women have so often chosen confessional songwriting.Sheila Whiteley, author of Women and Popular Music, suggests it is partly because \"women don't have that long history of songwriting. They can't refer to past examples which is why they go into themselves, drawing on themselves.\" The answer might also lie in the history of poetry. Even now, male singer-songwriters are often viewed as troubadors - historically, lyric poets whose subjects were chivalry and courtly love. Widely travelled and educated, troubadors existed under the patronage of a nobleman and were essentially writing to supply him with the tools to woo women.</p> <p>By contrast, the rise of confessional poetry came in the second half of the 20th century, and is exemplified by poets such as Sylvia Plath and Anne Sexton. The genre was defined by ML Rosenthal, in his 1959 essay Poetry as Confession which described it as verse that goes \"beyond customary bounds of reticence or personal embarrassment\". The troubadour tradition was as resolutely male as any other male lineage, and with its notions of chivalry and old-fashioned romance, it wasn't a relevant mode of expression for modern women writers. Confessional poetry was a more logical form for them to embrace, in part because it originated at a time of increasing female emancipation, and it tapped in to the idea that women, who had been voiceless for so long, had a story to tell, secrets to confess. On this basis, it is not surprising that female songwriters often plumped for a confessional approach too.</p> <p>Of course, there are male confessional songwriters, but Mills suggests that their songs are \"frequently almost tactical, part of seduction. It's confession with a point.\" The confessional tone of much female songwriting, by contrast, \"is not there to impress, or to seduce - it's not a dance move.\" As Morissette, speaking about the objective of her song You Oughta Know, one of Jagged Little Pill's most well-known tracks, once explained: \"It wasn't written to elicit a response from this person or to seek any sort of revenge. It was to unburden myself with my now allowing myself to just admit how I felt. And in admitting how I felt by singing it so many times I kind of transcended it, really. I was able to admit all of this and to go forth from there, instead of getting stuck.\"</p> <p>Without Exile in Guyville, without Phair and Amos, perhaps even Morissette, the musical landscape would look very different today. Their emotional and sexual candour cleared the way for subsequent generations of female songwriters - Cat Power, Feist, Laura Marling, Amy Winehouse among them - teaching them that to articulate their own thoughts and experiences was empowering, and that in singing of these uniquely female experiences, they could achieve the same heights as their male counterparts. To paraphrase Phair, the openness that she exhibited in Guyville has allowed female singer-songwriters, ever since, to \"stand 6ft 1in, instead of 5ft 2in. And that's quite an achievement.</p>",

  "<p>Judged on face value, Shane Meadows' new film is honest, earthy and affecting. Two lonesome teenagers - one British, one Polish - befriend each other on the streets of London. They hang out, get drunk and lope off in doe-eyed pursuit of a foxy French waitress. Half-an-hour in, the Polish dad has an announcement to make. \"Today, I went on a fast train through the tunnel, under the sea,\" he says. \"It only takes a couple of hours either way. Not bad, eh?\"</p> <p>Under normal circumstances this remark would sail by unnoticed, but these are not normal circumstances. When one realises that Meadows' movie is entirely funded by Eurostar, it's hard not to hear the line as a sales pitch - a word from our sponsor. Maybe it even makes you question the integrity of the film as a whole Is Somers Town a pureblood Meadows work in the vein of, say, Dead Man's Shoes, or the searing This Is England? Or is it something more slippery and suspect - \"a covert advertising campaign,\", as the film's Wikipedia entry puts it; \"essentially an advert,\" in the opinion of CNN.</p> <p>Somers Town isn't released in the UK until Friday, but Meadows has heard the rumblings. \"I know there are people out there going, 'Oh, it's all a big con,' \" he says. \"That's insulting to me, because I'm proud to have Somers Town in my family of work. If no one knew Eurostar had funded it, they wouldn't give it a second thought.\"</p> <p>For better or worse, Somers Town is a historic venture. Initially conceived as a nine-minute \"legacy project\" to commemorate the opening of the company's high-speed rail link to St Pancras, Somers Town swiftly snowballed. In the space of 10 days Meadows had shot so much footage he decided the short should become a feature. It went on to win awards at the Berlin and Edinburgh film festivals, a resounding triumph for all concerned. </p> <p>Talk to the men behind Somers Town and they'll tell you the same thing: the film is a drama, not an advertisement. The only stipulations imposed were that the film be set in Somers Town, and that it contain no \"gratuitous\" sex or violence. Aside from that, the director could do what he liked, enjoying complete creative control of a reported \u00a3500,000 budget. </p> <p>\"Basically we said to Shane, 'Whatever you think it is, it is,'\" says Greg Nugent, Eurostar's marketing director. \"This was Shane's project. We had no idea what was coming out, so there was a real danger of us ending up with something we couldn't use. That was a massive risk for us.\" It's safe to say the company is rather pleased with the way things panned out: instead of a short promo to put on their website, or screen on the train, they got a prize-winning drama with an infinite shelf life. \"This,\" agrees Nugent, \"is not how it was meant to be.\"</p> <p>Is there a precedent here? Product placement is almost as old as cinema itself. Brandchannel.com reports that there are 15 \"featured brands\" in The Dark Knight and a whopping 95 in Sex and the City. The likes of The Island and I, Robot have faced criticism for allegedly subjugating the plot to the plugs. Run, Fatboy Run (in which Simon Pegg runs the fictitious \"Nike River Run\") was dismissed by the Guardian's Peter Bradshaw as \"one enormous ad for Nike\". </p> <p>But it's hard to say how much money changes hands in these deals: product placement at the cinema remains entirely unregulated, both in the US and in the foreign markets that screen its films. Here in the UK, advertising agencies who work with film-makers are answerable to no one - not to Ofcom or the British Board of Film Classification. The numbers are presumably buried deep in the studio accounts.</p> <p>If nothing else, Somers Town deserves points for transparency. Meadows film is not a rag-bag of promiscuous product placement, but something else entirely - a tough, tender film that was nonetheless bought and paid for by one major company. It is an in-house production with one foot in the postwar heyday of the official British Rail film and the other in a shiny new era of corporate sponsorship and \"associative marketing\".</p> <p>Barnaby Spurrier, the film's producer, prefers to frame it in terms of artistic patronage. Eurostar might just have easily commissioned an artwork by Tracey Emin, or Gilbert and George. Instead they took a punt on a picture by the Midlands-based Meadows, one of the UK's most talented and distinctive film-makers. \"I do understand the suspicions, but I wish people would not prejudge,\" Spurrier says. \"It's so difficult to get British films made that any form of new finance deserves to be explored. The fact is that Shane made this under the exact same auspices as he'd make any film.\"</p> <p>So what's in it for Eurostar? Spurrier explains that they own the print and will get the revenue - assuming, as now seems likely, the film turns a profit. Nugent goes a step further, admitting that Eurostar has already benefited from its association with The Da Vinci Code, which it helped promote courtesy of a multi-million dollar deal with Columbia Pictures. Film, he says, makes a particular impact. \"If people are seeing the benefits to St Pancras and the regeneration we've been involved in, then that obviously helps our reputation. If that makes them more likely to go on a Eurostar train, then that's good as well.\"</p> <p>Over at Campaign magazine, deputy editor Francesca Fisher compares Somers Town to \"those traditional Coca-Cola ads - I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing. They gave you a nice feeling inside, but it was pretty intangible stuff. This film has the same effect. You come away thinking 'nice old Eurostar', and maybe that steers you towards buying a \u00a3150 train ticket.\"</p> <p>Released last month, Olivier Assayas's acclaimed Summer Hours, starring Juliette Binoche, spun out of a commission from the Mus\u00e9e D'Orsay. Now here's Somers Town. Fisher spots a trend here - a new avenue of finance for film-makers; a new media channel for advertisers. Even so, she assures me, it arrives with an in-built safety mechanism. \"The moment it's done badly it will be a disaster. If people sit down to watch a damn good film, then fair enough. But if they pay to watch some grossly overt propaganda then they'll feel cheated and will end up resenting the brand - and it will probably never happen again.\"</p> <p>All this would be so easy if Somers Town sucked. It would even be simpler if this was a slick and cynical product in the I, Robot mould. But Meadows' film is neither. Scripted by Paul Fraser, the director's longtime collaborator, it's a soulful social-realist drama that keeps the plugs to a minimum and revolves around a London that is resolutely unglamourised. For 90% of its run, Somers Town is beyond reproach. It's just the other 10% that set my alarm bells ringing. In its final moments, at least one major character gets to spend a weekend in Paris. Hitherto shot in black-and-white, the film abruptly explodes into luminous colour, like Dorothy visiting Oz. There are pavement artists and carousel rides. Lovers kiss outside the Sacr\u00e9-Coeur and a boy waves his Eurostar ticket up to the camera. </p> <p>So here is the charge I put to Meadows. If a film is funded by Eurostar, and it shows Eurostar in a positive light then it is, by definition, an advert for Eurostar. \"Well, if you want to define it that way, I've not got a clever argument to oppose it,\" he replies. \"But I never once thought about Eurostar when I was making this film. I'm not selling my soul to the devil here.\"</p> <p>Meadows has made commercials in the past, of course. He has shot ads for McDonald's, Quorn, Barclaycard and Natwest. In this regard, he's hardly unusual. Even Ken Loach made a McDonald's advert, back in 1990, long before he contributed to the McLibel documentary. Meadows has never made any bones about this; has never tried to distance himself from his corporate gigs. Somers Town, he says, was nothing like that. </p> <p>As he sees it, the film's only crime is that it \"tinkers with the Holy Bible of how films are made in this country\". Still based in his native Midlands, Meadows has spent his life finding unorthodox, wing-and-a-prayer ways of transferring his visions to the screen: Somers Town is just another way of achieving that end. So long as it's done right, he hopes other directors might follow his lead. </p> <p>\"There are a lot of positives here if you want to go looking for them,\" he points out. \"This is my first film in London, the first that proves I can move away from my community. It's also the first film where I've worked with actors in a foreign language. It's a film that's made me want to go to eastern Europe. It's a film that's started me on a whole new path.\"</p> <p>As it happens, I took a lot of positives from Somers Town, too. It is a deeply moving, sharply acted, beautifully structured piece of work; a worthy addition to the director's CV. And, as with Meadows, it's a film that made me want to travel, to go abroad; if not to eastern Europe then maybe to Paris, and maybe by train, a fast train under the Channel. Curse those nice feelings, that intangible stuff. Sometimes it's the most powerful stuff there is.</p> <p><strong>Somers Town </strong>is out on Friday.</p>",
  "<p>Let the hand-wringing begin. On a day when Britain's cyclists concluded their march into the nation's affection Christine Ohuruogu planted the Union flag on yet another corner of the Olympic landscape in Beijing, making her own magnificent contribution to the gold medal pile with victory in the women's 400 metres.</p> <p>At its purest level, where all that matters is speed, guts and athleticism, the 24-year-old Londoner's triumph was as awesome as anything witnessed over the past few days at the Olympic velodrome. </p> <p>Not many athletes would dare to give Sanya Richards a head start of 20 yards at the halfway point of the 400m and still believe they will break the finishing line ahead of the great American. </p> <p>Not many who find themselves 10 yards adrift going into the home straight still believe they have the strength to haul themselves back into contention. Not many believe they were destined to be Olympic champions.</p> <p>Ohuruogu believed and now she can add the most precious gold medal of all to those she won at the Commonwealth Games and World Championships. \"I thought she was great tonight,\" said the pre-race favourite and world No1 Richards, who eventually finished third. \"I was so proud of her.\"</p> <p>Yet if Britain's first track and field gold medallist of these Games did enough to win over her principal rival, there are those whom she will never win over; those for whom her one-year ban from the sport for missing three drug tests between October 2005 and June 2006 should serve as a life sentence, if not for her then certainly for her reputation. \"I don't care what people say,\" Ohuruogu said, her disgust plain that the subject of her ban could even be broached at the moment of her greatest triumph.</p> <p>Nowhere in the Olympic rulebook does it say that gold medallists are exempt from answering questions, including the most unpalatable ones, but even if last night's success did come with such immunity, Ohuruogu should most certainly care what people say.</p> <p>Without anti-doping rules, athletics is not much more than the wild-west with spikes. Without athletes who show respect for anti-doping rules, the sport will have even less credibility than it already has. And without credibility, athletics is nothing.</p> <p>Ohuruogu finds it tiresome to return time and again to the painful subject of her ban but she owes it to a sport that she clearly loves to acknowledge the genuinely felt concerns of those who care enough to pay attention. Such an approach would serve her cause better, just as it would be less provocative - if she chose contrition over victimhood, conciliation over unconcealed contempt for those whom she perceives as her enemies.</p> <p>Yet conciliation requires goodwill on both sides. Alas, the absolutists who would have had her banished into the sporting wilderness in perpetuity need little provocation. </p> <p>In their world of moral certitude everything she does is provocative, including winning her Olympic gold medal - an act that will, presumably, act as the starting gun for a fresh assault on her reputation and credibility.</p> <p>Like any athlete who has excelled at these Games, the Londoner underwent the mandatory doping test immediately after her race and she will be the target of the usual whisperings until the results are in. But unlike the vast majority of her peers, Ohuruogu is forced to fight on a second front: she should never have been able to challenge the life-long ban on competing in the Olympics, should never have been successful in overturning the ban and should never have been allowed to board the plane to Beijing, her critics will argue. </p> <p>If UK Athletics supported her when she sought to challenge the Olympic ban, then why did it fail to support Dwain Chambers? These are legitimate questions - the latter, in particular - but what Ohuruogu's critics fail to understand, or are unwilling to accept, is that she is not the one who should be providing the answers. </p> <p>Why should we ask a 24-year-old athlete to make sense of a subject that has proved beyond the combined might of UK Athletics, the British Olympic Association and the Royal Courts of Justice?</p> <p>She is not a lawyer or a moral philosopher. She is an athlete - one who broke the rules, certainly, but also one who then played by the rules. That should be enough for anyone. In the aftermath of a pulsating night in Beijing it was certainly enough for Sanya Richards.</p>",
  "<p>Trying to deal with knife crime confronts a problem which does not apply to the other worrying scourges of youth criminality: guns and drugs. Knives are essential items in every home in the country; no household can do without them. To keep a gun legally you need a licence, for which you have to give reasons for wanting one. Without a licence, you are committing an offence. But there is no such thing as an illegal kitchen knife, no licensing system, just hundreds of millions of knives everywhere, a large proportion of them capable of inflicting physical harm, costing little and easy to obtain for virtually everyone, of whatever age. They have, throughout history, been used to kill and injure, but never, it seems, to such an extent as today, in this country, by such young people.</p> <p>On this occasion, government and police cannot be accused of inactivity or complacency. Laws have been hardened, police powers to stop and search have been extended and schools have been given new powers. Doctors will probably soon decide that they should inform the police whenever an apparent victim of a knife crime comes to a hospital to have wounds seen to.</p> <p>Yesterday the home secretary, Jacqui Smith, inaugurated a campaign aimed at persuading children not to carry knives - even if they're doing so to defend themselves - and to persuade parents to play a bigger role in anti-knife education. I do not believe that media campaigns do very much to turn young people off drugs, drink, unprotected sex, cigarettes or whatever, and I don't think the \"It doesn't have to happen\" initiative can have any significant impact, though the participation of the likes of Rio Ferdinand and David Beckham can only do good. </p> <p>The home secretary also revealed the results of a police blitz recently carried out in 10 areas of knife-crime activity - 55,000 stopped and searched, 2,500 arrests, 1,600 knives and blades confiscated. She has promised more search arches and more search wands. Sounds good, but I want to know what happens to the arrested 2,500. Besides, I do not doubt that the vast majority of the 1,600 confiscated items will promptly have been replaced. </p> <p>Since last year it has been an offence to sell a knife to anyone under 18, punishable by a \u00a35,000 fine and a maximum six months' imprisonment. London's Evening Standard newspaper sent a 17-year-old boy to two areas of the capital which had suffered from knife crimes. Without any identification, he tried to buy various knives from more than a dozen well-known stores. The good news is that in most of them he was asked for his ID; and when this was not produced he was refused his request. But in four respectable establishments he was easily able to get what he asked for, without ID. The cashier at a Lidl superstore asked him: \"You're not going to go and kill someone, are you?\", before selling him a folding handsaw.</p> <p>The offending stores will, I trust, be prosecuted, but past practice in the courts - when the crime was to sell to under-16s rather than, as now, under-18s - show that the fines imposed were pitiful, and no one was imprisoned. Perhaps sentencers will become tougher now. But the restrictions on selling knives apply only to under-18s. Despite what one might think from the media publicity, the great majority of knife crimes are carried out by over-18s, who are entitled to buy knives without giving reasons or answering questions. Anyway, knife-carriers do not need to buy from shops. There are enough other sources.</p> <p>I seem to have produced a dossier of unremitting pessimism. I may be being too gloomy. It is possible that the accumulation of small improvements I've described will grow into a significant success. I hope so. But it is obvious to me that knife crime is just another manifestation of a society unease that goes back to those usual suspects: poor parenting, bad housing, inadequate schooling and nowhere for bored youngsters to go. Those are deficiencies which cannot be cured by stopping and searching or refusing to sell things to teenagers.</p> <p><strong>It was outrageous that the no-personality swimmer</strong> Michael Phelps could count as part of his tally of eight gold medals the three he won for being part of winning relay teams. I have a solution to this gross moral injustice. Only one medal should be awarded to the whole team, divided between its participating members. So Phelps would have received one quarter of a gold medal for being one of four victorious swimmers. That way, his Beijing total would be five and three-quarter gold medals, which is more truthful (and might have muted the absurd and ignorant claim that he is the greatest ever Olympian). </p> <p>But I have now discovered an unfortunate consequence of my suggestion. It would have to apply to all those courageous British rowers, sailors and cyclists whose success has been gained in concert with others. I do not have the heart to suggest that the winning \"Yngling girls, the three blondes in the boat\" (as they were referred to, even though one of them was clearly not blonde) accept only one third of a medal each, nor that the gallant, second-placed British rowing eight (actually nine when you count the cox), would each be fobbed off with 11.11 recurring per cent of a silver medal. The problem is to find a way of reducing Phelps's unwarranted reputation without in any way diminishing the glorious achievements of the glorious British athletes.</p> <p><strong>This week Marcel saw</strong> the musical West Side Story at Sadler's Wells: \"Totally wonderful. I'd only seen the film, but the stage version is far more vibrant and exciting.

  "<p>Christine Ohuruogu, the most controversial and complex of Team GB's record-breaking Olympians, delivered Britain's 16th gold medal of the games last night with a performance as stirring and sensational as any that have come before in a remarkable 10 days of achievement.</p> <p>The 24-year-old, who was only cleared to run in November after overturning a lifetime Olympic ban for missing three drugs tests, stormed to victory in the women's 400 metres to add Olympic gold to the Commonwealth and World Championship titles she holds.</p> <p>Having faced shame, deep-seated scepticism about the source of her achievements and the prospect of a premature end to a career of outstanding promise, last night she took a giant stride towards personal redemption. </p> <p>Ohuruogu's gold was the fourth of another outstanding day for Team GB, and ensures they will return home next week as the most successful since the 1908 games. The sailor Paul Goodison won gold in the Laser class at Qingdao, before the apparently invincible cyclists contributed two more Olympic champions in the shape of the sprinters Chris Hoy and Victoria Pendelton. Jason Kenny took silver behind Hoy, as did the high jumper Germaine Mason, who competed for Jamaica until 2005.</p> <p>All were eclipsed, however, by Ohuruogu's victory on a steaming night in the Bird's Nest stadium that saw her join Kelly Holmes, Sally Gunnell and Anne Packer as one of only four British women to win an Olympic title on the track.</p> <p>The victory, secured with a characteristically powerful finish that took her past fading rivals including the American favourite, Sanya Richards, in the final 50 metres, caps a remarkable 12 months in which she has bounced back from a drugs ban that threatened to end her career and destroy her reputation. </p> <p>Even Olympic gold is unlikely to snuff out all the uncertainty, but Ohuruogu professed to be unconcerned at the questions that will track her every step in international competition. Speaking almost three hours after her final victorious stride - her exit from the stadium was delayed by the demands of doping control and an endless round of broadcast interviews - she dismissed the cynics.</p> <p>\"I don't really care what people think or what people say,\" she said, with the gold medal hanging from her neck. \"As far as I am concerned I am here and I won a gold medal. They can say what they like but I really don't care.</p> <p>\"Why should this be spoiled unless someone tries to? I'm very happy with myself, I'm very happy that I have picked up three gold medals in three major championships.\"</p> <p>She admitted, however, that she had not slept for two nights before the race and felt \"huge pressure\" to deliver. \"I needed to sort my head out, I felt tired, I hadn't slept for the past two nights and the pressure was getting to me. But I just thought 'keep going, you can win'.\"</p> <p>Ohuruogu's indifference to her detractors has hardened during two years in which she has battled to overcome the self-inflicted wounds that threatened her Olympic dreams.</p> <p>In the spring of 2006 she seemed destined for a great and unblemished career. In March she won gold in the Melbourne Commonwealth Games, and the organisers of the London Olympics identified her as a potential poster-girl for 2012. Articulate and academically gifted, Ohuruogu is one of eight siblings born to Nigerian parents in Newham, east London, making her a perfect ambassador for 2012. </p> <p>All that changed in June when anti-doping officials arrived at Mile End Stadium in east London to collect a random sample only to find that she was training at Crystal Palace, 10 miles away. When she failed to arrive at the stadium within an hour, her career took a fateful turn.</p> <p>It was the second time in a fortnight that testers had tried and failed to test her, and the third in nine months. She faced an automatic one-year ban.</p> <p>Ohuruogu and her supporters have long said that the missed tests were the result of innocent errors. She says she missed the second test because she was completing an overdue article for a charity magazine, and the fateful third test because there was a school sports day at Mile End. Her friends and supporters, meanwhile, describe a woman whose academic prowess - she has a degree in linguistics - is at odds with occasional scattiness.</p> <p>\"I am generally not a disorganised person,\" she said before the Olympics. \"I am very busy. And busy means I get a bit scatterbrained and that is just how I am. I am not going to beat myself over it. The mistake was made and you just move on.\"</p> <p>Ohuruogu has consistently maintained that she is innocent of doping, and none of the numerous tribunals that have examined the case has ever concluded that she was intentionally evading the testers.</p> <p>Whatever the reason the implications were severe. As well as the one-year ban imposed by the governing body of athletics she had the Lottery funding for her training withdrawn. More significantly she was also immediately handed a life ban by the British Olympic Association.</p> <p>She took her first step on the road to Beijing a year ago when, returning to competition for the first time 20 days after the one-year suspension expired, she secured Britain's only gold of the World Championships in Osaka. It was a performance that spoke of great resolve and superb preparation, but she was shocked by the scepticism that greeted it in some quarters. \"It hit me hard,\" she said. \"I didn't realise what people were saying until my brother called me and, naturally, it upset me.\"</p> <p>On her return she set about overturning the BOA ban, and suggested she would compete for Nigeria if she was unsuccessful. Her cause was aided by recent precedent however, as two other athletes in the Beijing team, the triathlete Tim Don and the judoka Peter Cousins, had successfully overturned similar bans. The tribunal accepted her argument that there were mitigating circumstances and in November reinstated her. It also ruled that there was no evidence that she had deliberately avoided the testers, and 20 subsequent samples came up negative.</p> <p>Last night Ohuruogu said she had nothing left to prove to her detractors, and she may yet find herself reinstated as an ambassador for London. </p> <p>Lord Coe, chairman of the London organising committee, was part of the medal presentation party last night and congratulated her personally. </p> <p>She is taking nothing for granted however: \"I have given thought to London but it is a long way away,\" she said. \"It is literally on my doorstep and 15 minutes away from where my parents live, and it is where I was brought up and lived all my life so it would be great if I could say I would be there, but it is a long way away.\"</p>",

  "<p>Levy Mwanawasa, president of Zambia since 2002, came to international prominence only recently with his forthright criticisms of the conduct of this year's Zimbabwean elections. He said openly that he sympathised with the plight of Morgan Tsvangirai, the Zimbabwean opposition leader, and would have no doubt led the anger of many African leaders against Robert Mugabe had he not suffered a stroke at the Sharm el-Sheikh African Union summit in June. He was taken to a hospital in France, where he has died aged 59.</p> <p>It was his second stroke, the first coming in April 2006. Before that his slurred speech, arising from a serious car accident on December 8 1991, had earned him the unfair nickname of \"the Cabbage\". The car accident was rumoured to have been a botched assassination attempt as Mwanawasa, by then vice-president, was outspoken against corruption.</p> <p>Born in Mufulira, in the copperbelt region of central Zambia, and a law graduate of the University of Zambia, he made his name in 1989, as the defence counsel for Lieutenant General Christon Tembo, charged with treason against the regime of President Kenneth Kaunda. Kaunda was shocked as crowds cheered Tembo, and Mwanawasa became a celebrity. Popular support for Kaunda continued to plummet and he lost power in 1991. Mwanawasa was made vice-president in the Movement for Multiparty Democracy government of Frederick Chiluba.</p> <p>Mwanawasa did not take easily to politics and retired from office in 1994, only to return and eventually succeed Chiluba as president, winning the controversial 2001 elections. The supreme court judged, in 2005, that those elections had been marred by irregularities, but not enough to overturn the result. Mwanawasa won a second term in 2006, four months after his first stroke.</p> <p>Before then, in 2004, he revealed the thin skin that had always allowed barbs to hurt him. When the Lusaka satirist Roy Clarke likened him to a great fat elephant, Mwanawasa was enraged and ordered his deportation, to which the courts did not agree, as Clarke was not a Zambian citizen. The episode characterised Mwanawasa's presidency - the bold steps he took were always tempered with equivocation. He prosecuted Chiluba on charges of corruption and instigated anti-corruption measures, but barely managed to contain the rise of greater corruption. He improved conditions in the main hospitals, but allowed them to degenerate in the public universities. He became the darling of the IMF and western banks for his neo-liberal reforms, but was only able to instigate these reforms on the back of an unforeseen boom in mineral prices. And, while the macro-economic figures depicted Zambia as a rare African country in good economic health, a huge percentage of Zambians lived in poverty.</p> <p>However, he did ensure the robust condition of political debate in Zambia. Elections were flawed but fair. A free press flourished. Debate, if not action, on HIV was taking place. He attracted a foreign investment and aid, roads and communications were improved, and he left the private sector in much better shape.</p> <p>Mwanawasa was one of those uncharismatic transitional figures, of whom Africa probably needs more, who takes a nation imperfectly forward. </p> <p>In his last few months he made the mark that no one predicted, by holding that Africa should not tolerate the situation in Zimbabwe, challenging the culture of silence much as he has done as a young lawyer. He is survived by his wife Maureen; he had four children by her, and two by an earlier marriage.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Levy Mwanawasa, politician, born September 3 1948; died August 19 2008</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Friday August 22 2008.

  "<p>Brothers do seem to have a degree of difficulty in getting along. Look at Cain and Abel, Romulus and Remus, Mike and Bernie Winters.</p> <p>Ambridge shuddered this month as the Grundy brothers collided. The problem was, of course, Emma, the milkman's clotted-cream daughter. She has been dithering between Will (right but repulsive) and Ed (wrong but romantic) for years. So much so that a DNA check was needed to establish which one was the father of her son, George. It was Will. However, this month she and Ed finally sealed their troth in the cowshed to a background chorus of turtle doves. Emma passed the joyful tidings on to Will, who had just returned from a really good display of ferreting: \"Me and Ed are back together. You don't mind, do you?\"</p> <p>Will minded. Far from wringing Ed's hand, he tried to wring Ed's neck and, as a gamekeeper, he had had plenty of practice. Only Emma's fortuitous arrival (\"Will, stop it! You're going to kill him!\") prevented a far more interesting story line.</p> <p>You would be looking at a gamekeeper with a grievance for some time before you were reminded of a ray of sunshine. Will now sank into bottomless gloom and ran away - judge of his despair - to Yarmouth. Or to \"a dead end and a pile of sand dunes\", as Ed put it when he went to bring him home. Poor old Will, never the life and soul of the party, was now doing a disturbingly accurate impression of Eeyore, the clinically depressed donkey. </p> <p>Gamekeepers have easy access to chainsaws and shotguns. Will's alarmed employer, Brian Aldridge, palmed this ticking time-bomb off on a Gloucestershire shoot for six months, describing him as \"a bright young keeper\". May God forgive him.</p> <p>All this leads one to puzzle anew where Borsetshire can possibly be, as everyone reacted to Gloucestershire (\"Gloucestershire!\") as though it were the dark side of the moon. Which should suit Will nicely.</p>",
  "<p>It seems that, contrary to what we were promised, colourful V-necks and bias-cut skirts can't always get a woman out of trouble. Trinny and Susannah have, as one tabloid chortled inevitably, \"fallen out of fashion\" with viewers, with viewing figures down from 7 million to 2.5 million.</p> <p>Well, the novelty of watching posh English girls bang on about boobs and bums on TV can last only so long, particularly if they insist on banging on about them quite so aggressively. The duo argued that showing women how clothes could make them look thinner actually gave them more confidence. Others might counter that barking on about the alleged importance of looking \"nice and slim\" does about as much for women's self-esteem as a bumper pack of Nuts magazines.</p> <p>Yet the real fly in Trinny and Susannah's once golden ointment is most likely a young man who has probably never worn a wraparound cashmere top in his life - Gok Wan. His show How to Look Good Naked peaked last year with 3.4 million viewers while Gok's Fashion Fix is averaging 2 million. Considering that he is on the relatively minnowesque Channel 4, while Trinny and Susannah were on BBC and now ITV1, one can safely describe this as a trouncing.</p> <p>One theory is that the secret of his success is being so much nicer than T&amp;S. This is not exactly true. Like the ladies, Wan believes that no outfit is complete without control-top knickers. But whereas Trinny and Susannah think that looking taller/thinner/younger are the sole factors behind one's choice of wardrobe, Wan knows that maybe some other reasons come into play. Like having fun.</p> <p>Wan is a product of the new fashion generation, one raised in the shadow of the celebrity-obsessed high street. If Trinny and Susannah's holy grail is a dress from Marks &amp; Spencer (T&amp;S love M&amp;S) that \"skims over the stomach\", then Wan's is a version of a McQueen gown that was recently worn by Kate Moss, tricked out by Peacocks for \u00a322. His approach is more in tune with these Closer-reading times.</p> <p>T&amp;S may occasionally talk about their past problems but are too full of braying self-confidence to convince Mavis from Surbiton that they were once like her. Instead, they come across as a gorgon-headed beast of matronly,imperious bossiness. Wan, however, was once an obese bullied teenager who made himself over to resemble a Chinese Jarvis Cocker and somehow convinced the world that he is a fashion expert and every woman's gay best friend. The man is a reality TV show in his own right. And, really, it's hard to get more zeitgeisty than that.</p>",
  "<p>When David Cameron sent every Tory MP off for the summer with a reading list, it was easy to spy members of the government-in-waiting on holiday in newly fashionable Padstow. Floppy-haired heads bend over Robert Kagan's The Return of History and the End of Dreams, or Cold Cream: My Early Life and Other Mistakes, by Ferdinand Mount. Toiling through the 25-volume list, with only a biography of Boris Johnson for light relief, the Tories are enduring a hard summer's slog. But those of us who have accepted with resignation the imminent end of the New Labour project have our own catch-up reading to do. I have boned up on who our new political masters are to be by carefully scrutinising the pages of the new right - a user's manual. </p> <p>On first sight, it looks like chick lit. It's called Shire Hell and it's a paperback with a pretty cartoony village on the front (with wind farm) and the inside cover is adorned with praise from such political grandees as Jilly Cooper, India Knight, Sophie Kinsella and the review pages of Tatler and Easy Living. But don't be fooled. Its author, Rachel Johnson, is Boris Johnson's freelance journalist sister and what she has written is no less than a pin-perfect portrait of the 2008 zeitgeist: a satire of the new green Tories, the old shires and the new money. If you want to know what we are in for, then this is the book of the year. Wrap the dust-jacket of Philip Bobbitt's Terror and Consent: The Wars for the Twenty-First Century around it if you're too embarrassed to be seen reading it but you will not find anywhere else a more accurate and detailed study of the coming Cameronian right.</p> <p>Johnson's previous book, Notting Hell, anatomised the Notting Hill set and was judged to be a thinly disguised portrait of her neighbours: its political classes (David and Samantha Cameron, George Osborne and Michael Gove); the media power couple (Emma Freud and Richard Curtis); the minimalist architect (John Pawson); the supermodel (Elle Macpherson); the American tycoon (Peter Soros). The residents bicker over the communal gardens and compare shades of cream from the Farrow &amp; Ball paint chart. Their dinner guests are chefs Rowley Leigh and Sally Clarke. They went to Eton (known as School) with Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall. They dress their children in miniature Prince of Wales checked knickerbockers, designed by a Frenchwoman in South Kensington. They knock out six children as evidence not of poor understanding of contraception but as the ultimate status symbol to show they have \"more money and more help to buy sleep, the most precious beauty product of all\". To be poor in Notting Hell is to be forced to wear a Whistles skirt and LK Bennett shoes. </p> <p>Anyone passing through Notting Hill in the first years of this century would have been floored by the enormous wealth on display. From a run-down neighbourhood in the 50s in which recent arrivals from the Caribbean rented squalid rooms from slum landlord Peter Rachman, Notting Hill imperceptibly turned into a neighbourhood in which only the gadzillionaire could afford to buy one of its ice-cream-coloured mansions. Notting Hill was where \"a cosy kitchen supper\" really meant \"a catered \u00a3200-a-head dinner\". The Notting Hill Yummy Mummy lived, according to Johnson, \"an organic life of holistic therapies and private training sessions in a multimillion-pound house . .. with just a couple of small Filipinas chained up in the basement ... [It was] about having slate solar panels to heat your London home ... as well as an eight-bedroom spread in Shropshire ... about having your hair shirt never too far from your Helmut Lang in your walk-in cupboard.\"</p> <p>By the end of Notting Hell, adulterous freelance journalist Mimi and her old Etonian husband Ralph (which if you do not know is pronounced \"Rafe\" just shows what riff-rafe you are) have fled to Dorset, selling up the inherited Notting Hill pile to take their place in the new shires - the outposts of civilisation, where \"there are no normal shops - ie ones selling Swarovski-crystal-encrusted designer jeans, organic hemp baby-clothes, Elle Macpherson Intimates - within a hundred-mile radius\". And it is so cold indoors once you move a couple feet from the Aga that the required garment is one of those quilted waistcoats in army green with brass poppers, which is apparently called a Husky.</p> <p>Dorset is inhabited by the old gentry, new City money, the Grundy under-class and the eco-warriors who live in yurts. It is a world in which you are a social nobody if you don't hold your own literary festival in the grounds of your stately home, or operate an organic farm shop making heritage cheeses. You cannot write this book if you are not part of it. Johnson's husband, Ivo Dawnay, is an old Etonian (surely a coincidence) but is it satire or affectionate portrait of the Tory world? Cleverly, she manages to just get away with a light satirical edge. She was sent into social purdah when Notting Hell came out, and all her neighbours recognised themselves, so Shire Hell is set in the invented town of Godminster. Its characters include Virginie Lacoste, \"stone-cold French superfox and children's culotte magnate\"; Granville and Catherine Cobb, owners of the Court Place farm shop and additional properties in Gstaad, Tuscany and California; Ned Bryanstone, local landowner living on capital with an expensive second wife who runs her own literary festival. </p> <p>In mid-August, Johnson, like all Tories, is not-in-town. She is in Exmoor, in her second home. I asked if the book was meant to be a satire on the Cameron set. \"I didn't have David Cameron in my head, but I was pitilessly photographing for the page what is my milieu's experience of country living, from having the Aga to owning the right boot rack. I wanted to show exactly how things look. The Conservatives are very materialistic and they dress this up with their greenness but it's just a new form of consumerism. All these things are status symbols, like Liz Hurley's Gloucester Old Spot pigs. The countryside has given people a larger canvas to display their wonderfulness.\" </p> <p>The intersection of the worlds of Notting Hill and the countryside are brilliantly illustrated by an incident that took place at last year's gala dinner hosted by Alexandra Shulman, editor of Vogue, to launch the Golden Age of Couture show at the V&amp;A. On being introduced to Kate Moss, Cameron commiserated with her for the summer flooding that had washed out her Cotswold village, which is in his constituency, and spoke knowledgeably of when the local pub might reopen. Impressed, Moss asked for his phone number. Returning to his table, Cameron proudly announced that he was expecting a call from Moss; unfortunately it was because she thought he was a plumber. </p> <p>In the coming Tory administration, the countryside will move to the centre of modish life and will bring to bear a new influence on the political agenda. \"The Tories have made the countryside very chic,\" Johnson says. \"It's a show-off thing. It allows them to say, 'We come from the soil.' And of course the shires are all Tory. Labour has done brilliantly in bringing out sleepy rural communities to a greater level of activism.\" The coming of the shires as a powerhouse of influence derives, she says, from Labour's apparent hatred of the countryside - if the Iraq war is the left's cause, the hunting ban is the right's bete noire. But the countryside had been neglected before Labour. \"Thatcher had no feel for the countryside,\" Johnson points out. The absence of rural buses long predates the 1997 Labour landslide.</p> <p>The Cameronians understand the countryside not just because they are pro-hunting and shooting and patronising the serfs, but because the Tories have, Johnson claims, benefited from the creation of enormous City wealth under Labour. The past decade has seen the self-invention of a new class she calls the agrivistes (and she includes in Shire Hell an important new coinage, the Jewray Henrys, which she says was first used by the new owner of a country estate, fitted with kosher kitchen). \"Money came into the City and rolled out west,\" she says. It was a tide which raced through west London into the counties, through the Cotswolds and on to Cornwall. Johnson herself being, if not old money, at least old class, accuses Gordon Brown of failing to tax the super-rich (is she perhaps closet old Labour?), while placing intolerable pressures on rural communities. While the decayed aristocracy has been secretly relieved to offload its large and unheatable houses, balls and chains around the necks of generations of eldest sons, it also resents the buyers who swoop in from London to view properties from the controls of a helicopter then install electronic gates, which protect the estates from the prying eyes of their former owners.</p> <p>But with the recession, the flood of wealth into the countryside has come to an abrupt halt. Reading Shire Hell three weeks ago, I felt that it was a moment in the zeitgeist so forensically captured that it was already passing away into history as you turned the pages. Johnson agrees. \"I'm the death knell to every trend. With this massive recession looming, Shire Hell may already be an anachronism. Notting Hill ended with a great jolt, with people losing their jobs in the City. It's not cool to flash it about so much now. I've heard people saying they won't take their chef in the yacht this summer and that they will have to cut back from four to two polo ponies. Thrift is the new chic.\"</p> <p>This is where Cameron comes in. Johnson claims not to be part of his set, but with her brother running London one could hardly expect their worlds not to collide. She's stayed at the country house he rents for his holidays. If you want to understand the coming Tory chic it's \"a very simple but comfortable house, there are gillies and people stalking\". I assume she does not mean crazed monomaniacs in bedrooms plastered with photographs of Jill Dando, but chaps in tweed caps toting Purdeys. Or is that wrong? Obviously, being Labour, I've no idea. The shires, Johnson says, \"are dear to [Cameron]. He brilliantly combines the new green and the old Tories.\" Will he repeal the hunting ban? \"In my view he should,\" she says, \"but I don't think he will because it would lose them votes in the cities and that's going to be a critical thing for him.\"</p> <p>So what can we expect from the new shire-friendly administration when Gordon Brown is finally dragged by his bloody fingernails into a general election? Sex, obviously. \"The whole thing of sex in the city is a great myth,\" Johnson points out. Londoners are too stressed out to bonk. In Shire Hell, as in Jilly Cooper's novels before it, rural life is a complicated web of marital infidelities and children of doubtful parentage. There's something about being close to the land that revs up the hormones. Sex is more natural and less is made of it. Johnson describes hunts in which two horses somehow become detached from the main pack, head out into the gorse and return with their dishevelled riders picking twigs out of their hair. To live in the countryside is to shag, ride, drink, or all three. Johnson says, and I find myself for the first time in our conversation a little sceptical, that she derives her observer's eye from the fact that she does none of them, and is a \"disenfranchised outsider\". In her author photo she looks like what Frasier Crane would pantingly describe as a \"dirty girl\". In saying she does not \"do sex\" you want to remind her of the extremely raunchy sex column she writes for Easy Living.</p> <p>Knowing precisely how to dress for the country is what divides the Tories from Labour. The Dorset dress code divides between Ralph Lauren patchwork cowgirl skirt and the entire stock of the Boden catalogue. The Camerons, on their Cornwall beach holiday, appeared to be dressed from head to toe in Boden, while poor Gordon Brown sat hunched in the sand grimacing for the camera in his work jacket with Sarah Brown still in her shift dress and stilettos. Johnny Boden (Eton and Oxford) and his wife Sophie are close friends of Rachel Johnson and trailing them was part of the research for the book. He gets cross when she mentions other brands.</p> <p>If the agrivistes brought Stella McCartney and Marc Jacobs to Dorset, then the sexed-up country-dwellers manage to attract each other clothed in \"tapestry-patterned embroidered cardigans\" and \"rugby shirts tucked into fractionally too-tight high-waisted jeans\". The social uncertainty of the agrivistes is measured by the studied look of their country clothes, the hilarious cravat that makes them look like \"total country plonkers\".</p> <p>In Notting Hell, freelance journalist Mimi, who will later move to Dorset, is a Guardian-reading Labour voter. Is this a device to enable Johnson to deploy her satire from behind safe cover? Or is Boris Johnson's sister secretly pinker than a huntsman's coat? At any rate, Labour voters have a spy in the enemy's camp. When the Tories win the election, they are going to have to find a way of muzzling her. Westminster Hell must be the next volume in the series.</p>",
  "<p>Muslim prisoners, including some convicted terrorists, inside one of Britain's biggest high security prisons feel so unsafe that they have sought sanctuary in the jail's segregation unit for their own protection, the chief inspector of prisons discloses today. </p> <p>Anne Owers says that there have been serious incidents of \"prisoner-on-prisoner\" violence inside Frankland prison, near Durham, with black and ethnic minority inmates in general the target of attacks and Muslim prisoners in particular.</p> <p>Owers says in her inspection report on the high security jail published today that some, but not all, of the Muslim inmates who have been attacked had been convicted of terrorism offences.</p> <p>Fourteen prisoners have been identified by the prison authorities as involved in racist activities, some for racially motivated offences and others with links to racist organisations. Owers also reports there has been a \"serious incident\" involving groups of black and ethnic minority prisoners and white prisoners.</p> <p>Two high-profile terrorists, Dhiren Barot and Omar Khyam, were moved out of Frankland prison in March amid claims the jail had become \"an extremely dangerous environment for ethnic minority prisoners\". Barot's solicitor, Mudassar Arani, told the high court that boiling water and oil had been thrown over Barot last July and he had spent a week in hospital.</p> <p>The prison inspectors report that when they surveyed inmates about their treatment by staff the responses by black and ethnic minority prisoners were worse than those of white prisoners on a range of issues and they were also over-represented in all disciplinary procedures, including use of force, segregation and adjudications. </p> <p>Staff understanding and knowledge of Muslim prisoners was particularly weak. Muslim prisoners had been stopped from holding communal prayers in cells, on landings and in exercise yards without the chaplaincy being consulted.</p> <p>Frankland, with more than 700 inmates convicted of serious offences, is one of the largest high-security jails. Owers says its population has become even more \"challenging\" for staff recently with an influx of prisoners with gang affiliations and the arrival of a small number of terrorists. </p> <p>\"It is unfortunate that this coincided with the absence of the governor for some months, and the resulting drift that was observable at this inspection needs urgently to be reversed,\" said Owers.</p> <p>She says that action is particularly important as Frankland is due to expand to more than 1,000 prisoners - far more than any dispersal prison has so far been required to hold.</p> <p>The inspection, carried out in February, found no evidence of a robust strategy to reduce violence to deal with bullying and ensure safety, order and control. More than one in four prisoners on the general wings tested positive for drugs - a high ratio for a high-security jail.</p> <p>Owers does, however, praise the prison's work on the special dangerous and serious personality disorders unit, which holds 80 of the most dangerous prisoners in the prison system. She says that innovative work is being carried out. </p> <p>Phil Wheatley, the director general of the National Offender Management Service, said he was concerned about the comments about the safety of prisoners within Frankland but added they should be seen within the context of the prison's \"extremely challenging\" population.</p> <p>\"The issues raised in the report are currently being addressed by the governor and staff at Frankland. A new diversity and safer prisons manager is in post to ensure a focus on matters raised by the inspector in relation to anti-bullying and diversity.\"</p>",
  "<p>You could argue that the guitarist Jimi Hendrix, in his brief, dazzling career, galvanised jazz as much as he shook up pop and rock. In three years, he sketched out several lifetimes' worth of possibilities in sound, rhythm and showmanship. His example sparked a new generation of musicians - Jaco Pastorius, Mike Stern, George Duke - and encouraged more established figures, such as Miles Davis, Gil Evans and Joe Zawinul, to reinvent their careers.</p> <p>The jazz-funk guitarist Hiram Bullock, who has died aged 52, was one of the new breed of guitarists liberated by Hendrix's example, and uninhibited by preconceptions of what jazz and rock were supposed to be. He was a flamboyant stylist, as comfortable jamming with legends as doing sessions or television.</p> <p>Though he released many solo albums, he is best remembered as a sideman, albeit one who was rarely self-effacing. His CV included studio work with Sting, Bonnie Tyler, Kenny Loggins and Marcus Miller, and he played memorable stints with jazz composers Evans and Carla Bley, and saxophonist David Sanborn. </p> <p>US television viewers of a certain age will remember him as the \"barefoot guitarist\" in The World's Most Dangerous Band, the house musicians, led by Paul Shaffer, of the long-running Late Night with David Letterman show on NBC.</p> <p>Born in Osaka, Japan, where his parents had been posted with the US military, Bullock moved to America aged two and grew up in Baltimore, where he learned the piano, saxophone and bass, before switching to guitar at 16. He went to Miami University, studying alongside Pat Metheny and Pastorius, and a regular gig with singer Phyllis Hyman soon led him to New York City. By his mid-20s, he had played with a host of stars including Billy Joel, Joan Armatrading, Paul Simon and Chaka Khan - plus every crossover project in town, among them the Brecker Brothers, Sanborn, Hank Crawford, Bob James and his own New York City Band. He joined Evans's band for its irregular tours and regular Mondays at New York's Sweet Basil club.</p> <p>Bullock played with Pastorius's trio in his final, difficult years and made significant contributions to Bley's compositional palette, playing live and on albums such as Night Glo and Sextet (ECM Records). One of his most memorable moments was soloing on the Hendrix song Little Wing on Sting's Nothing Like the Sun (A&amp;M, 1987). This was no casual session - the ex-Police frontman had sat in with Evans at Sweet Basil, and recruited his entire band for that track.</p> <p>Anyone who heard the Evans band during the 1980s will testify to Bullock's raw energy and inventiveness, which his boss clearly relished.</p> <p>Asked whether Bullock had achieved his potential as a jazz guitarist, the London Jazz Festival programmer John Cumming replied that it may not matter whether Hiram was a jazz player or not. \"He essentially came from a blues, funk and rock corner, and it was his ability to bring this attack to a jazz context that always seemed to be the defining factor,\" said Cumming. \"It was this that endeared him to artists like Gil, for instance. Although he played on countless sessions, he was a great live performer, and this is where he stood out, whether with Sanborn, Bley or Gil Evans.\"</p> <p>Bullock's health had been damaged by drug abuse. A poignant blog entry (posted in March this year) described his treatment for throat cancer: \"Basically, they poison me to kill the cancer, then bring me back to health (actually I guess that last part is on me). I needed to lose some weight anyway!\"</p> <p>He is survived by his partner, Jennifer, and two stepsons.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Hiram Law Bullock, guitarist and songwriter, born September 11 1955; died July 25 2008</p>",
  "<p>Exactly 150 years ago, an exceptionally hot spell of summer weather reduced the Thames flowing through London to a scandalous condition known as The Great Stink. Queen Victoria, travelling down the river to Millwall docks, had to contain her nausea by clamping a bouquet to her nose. The fumes were not only foul but terrifying, since they were thought to be pestilential - the source of cholera.</p> <p>The Great Stink, with its power of concentrating MPs' faculties, led to the introduction of legislation for the transformation of sewerage in London. An unprecedented sum for a domestic purpose, \u00a33m, was voted for intercepting sewers to be tunnelled along the riverside by Sir Joseph Bazalgette. The act, rushed through by August 1858 was to lead to revolutions in local government and public health engineering throughout the world.</p> <p>If only such action was expressed today. Great Stinks are still routinely emanated by rivers swollen with raw sewage and reduced to a trickle in the hot season in parts of Asia, Africa and Central America. But the stench does not instil the same degree of terror.</p> <p>Equivalent attention and massive public investment are desperately needed today on behalf of the 40% of the world's population - 2.6 billion people - without a means of dealing with the personal waste evacuation process that everyone on the planet has to manage on a daily basis. </p> <p>To try to change this, the UN declared 2008 the International Year of Sanitation. But for go-getting sanitary publicists, despite the annual death toll of 1.5 million children from diarrhoeal disease, the life-threatening menace of \"feculent corruption\" does not carry the edge it once did.</p> <p>Nor do great figures and celebrities rally to their cause. They are happy to lend their names to campaigns for clean water. But do they ever mention the reason why \"dirty\" water poses a threat to child health, the lack of toilets to contain detritus and consequent faecal contamination? Programmes for \"water and sanitation\" conveniently forget the \"S\" word too. They spend the lion's share of their resources on water: 95% in Madagascar, for example, leaving just 3p per head a year to spend on sanitation. </p> <p>Madagascar is typical. Sanitation has rock-bottom political priority in country after country. Privatisation of municipal utilities - at the bidding of the World Bank and others - has compounded the problem, since any profits to be made are all in water supply, which people need to survive. But sanitation is a public good and, as the Victorians discovered, needs to be subsidised from the public purse.</p> <p>Faced with the Great Stink and its consequences, Victorian celebrities lost their squeamishness. When Bazalgette's southern intercepting sewer was opened in 1865, the Prince of Wales, the Lord Mayor of London, the Archbishop of Canterbury and 500 dignitaries dined on salmon while the city's excreta gushed forth beneath them. During the International Year of Sanitation, an international photo opportunity with a religious, royal or senior political personage on a lavatorial throne has so far failed to materialise.</p> <p>Unless more attention, and less embarrassment, can be garnered by sanitation's international exponents, there will be little prospect of achieving the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) in sanitation, declared in 2002. After intense lobbying at the Johannesburg Earth summit, a goal to reduce by half by 2015 the numbers of people without access to sanitation in 1990, was added to an identical goal for water. But of all the MDGs, this one lags furthest behind. On current progress, it will take until 2076 to reach the goal in Africa. </p> <h2>Safe and convenient</h2> <p>One of the excuses offered by politicians and planners for the resounding lack of attention to sanitation is that there is no popular demand for toilets - unlike water. But the reason why demand is not expressed is because the subject is taboo, not because people don't feel it. Women, especially in urban areas of the developing world, desperately need somewhere to \"go\" that is safe and convenient. The night-time expedition to the bush or open ditch can lead to sexual harassment and attack. Reputation is also at stake. In urban South Africa, a woman seen cleaning a public latrine is unmarriageable. Such topics are unlikely to surface in a meeting with the local MP.</p> <p>Handled carefully, demand for sanitation can and does emerge. The current lodestar in sanitation is an approach called community-led total sanitation (CLTS), pioneered in Bangladesh. The shock tactic of the strategy is to point out that members of the community are eating each other's detritus.</p> <p>The accumulated evidence and disgust prompts conversion to the doctrine of \"open defecation-free\" behaviour and mass commitment to the building of household toilets. This strategy is surprisingly effective - and not just in Bangladesh. In a recent CLTS pilot in southern Zambia, the local chief became so engaged that he took it upon himself to chivy his subjects into toilet construction. </p> <p>It is not surprising that those who venerate their ancestors - as in Madagascar - might object to burying faeces in their underground resting-place. Nor that those used to the open air might feel claustrophobic in a hot, dark, and often smelly toilet house. However, in an increasingly crowded rural landscape, and in slums and townships where people are living almost on top of each other, the days of open defecation ought speedily to come to an end. </p> <p>The question, then, is how to meet demand among poorer citizens for whom such a significant home improvement represents a huge financial output.</p> <p>The International Year of Sanitation has managed to galvanise the international community - the Department for International Development, schools of hygiene and tropical medicine, <a href=\"http://www.wateraid.org/\">WaterAid</a>, Unicef and the World Health Organisation - to undertake new ventures on the excretory frontier. Gradually, more resources are being found. But current policy seems to expect that many of these will be spent on re-training public health engineers and turning experts with spigots and ball-cocks into experts in lavatorial spin. </p> <p>The public health revolution that followed London's Great Stink required large investments of public funds on infrastructure. The sanitary revolution needed for the 21st century requires investment not in vast tunnels for sewerage, but in helping to create an intermediary sanitary economy with cheap, attractive, good quality products ready to meet the emerging demand for simple, decent facilities. Such an economy would have the attraction of providing local people with jobs - not as miserable muck-shovellers, but in respectable skilled occupations.</p> <p>There is still almost half of the International Year of Sanitation left in which to bring about a new sanitary revolution. What is needed is new openness, and the same political push committed 150 years ago to solving London's crisis. Who with celebrity status could help in the UK to put pressure on our government and on the international community? Or will we have to rely on a 21st century rash of epidemics and dying rivers to put this most basic of problems on the popular and political agenda?</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Maggie Black is the author with Ben Fawcett of The Last Taboo: Opening the Door on the Global Sanitation Crisis, published by Earthscan, \u00a316.99.</p>",
  "<h2>Britain in the dock</h2> <p>Just in case you believed any earlier guff about the government taking the environment seriously, Eco Soundings sees that the EU environment commissioner, Stavros Dimas, has quite lost patience with Britain and is referring us to the European court of justice for failing to convert the EU liability directive into domestic law. \"This is one of the most significant new pieces of EU environmental law of the last few years\", storms Dimas. \"More than a year after the deadline, it is high time it was transposed,\" he says.</p> <h2>Up in the air</h2> <p>Meanwhile, Jonathan Shaw, minister for air quality, has replied to the 12 NGOs that wrote to Gordon Brown about their concerns that Britain was not meeting new EU air quality laws. Shaw fails, yet again, to commit Britain to comply fully with the laws and offers no ideas how the UK intends to meet the obligations. That brings the tally to five ministers and the prime minister who have now declined to do so. </p> <h2>Humorous emissions</h2> <p>Is the air conditioning on the blink at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs' HQ? How else to explain a rare outbreak of humour last week, when a press release from the usually gloomy department about new wildlife laws was headed \"Kermitted to frog protection\". An exciting new trend, and one we look forward to being continued. \"Emissions impossible\" when describing the latest carbon pollution figures perhaps?</p> <h2>Shame on you</h2> <p>Meanwhile, more than 300 local authorities have admirably signed up to the Nottingham declaration on climate change, but that still leaves a good few that haven't bothered, or that are in denial. The Local Government Association does not want to embarrass those councils that haven't signed, but Eco Soundings is not so coy and plans to name and shame them starting next week. You have been warned.</p> <h2>GMO profit monster</h2> <p>Memo to environment minister Phil Woolas, who wants evidence that GMOs are a disaster. Monsanto, which now has a virtual monopoly of US transgenic soya, cotton, and corn seed sales, has just made record profits in the middle of a world food crisis. That has not stopped it writing to US farmers saying that its \"competitive challenges\" have \"forced\" it to increase its herbicide prices more than 50%, and the price of its corn and soya seeds by 35%. Twelve states, and 35 farm and citizen groups, are calling for an investigation into Monsanto's competitive practices. </p> <h2>Falling short</h2> <p>US: one. Germany: two. China: five. UK: six. Is this the Olympic medal table? No, it's the Ernst &amp; Young annual league table of world renewable energy, which shows us dropping like a stone, despite signing up to 15% renewables by 2020. Largely it's because the energy bill is still stuck in parliament. \"To make the UK a world leader in attracting investment in this sector, and to avoid it slipping further down the index, the government needs to consider creating incentives for investors, following the lead of Germany and the ambition of China,\" says the report.</p>",
  "<p>Andy Baddeley made a bold bid in the 1500 metres here last night but the speed of the Olympic final was too much for him. The British No1 was fifth at the bell but slipped back to ninth as Rashid Ramzi, of Bahrain, won in 3min 32.94sec.</p> <p>\"Even though I was in a decent position, some pretty bad spiking halfway round hurt me a bit and, when I tried to push on with the leaders, I just couldn't,\" said Baddeley, who ran 3:35.37.</p> <p>\"Still, no regrets, no excuses, I did all I could. I am disappointed to finish so far down the field, especially after doing so well in the heats, but this is motivation for me and I'll go away, work hard and come back fitter and stronger next time.\" </p> <p>Britain's Sarah Claxton finished eighth in the 100m hurdles but it proved to be heartbreaking for the leading American Lolo Jones. She was heading for gold when she clipped the penultimate barrier and could not recover. Her team-mate Dawn Harper powered through to take gold. \"You hit a hurdle about twice a year where it affects your race,\" said Jones. \"It's just a shame that it was on the biggest race of my life. It's like when you are in a racing car and you hit a curve, either you can maintain control or you can crash and burn. Today I crashed and burned.\"</p> <p>Usain Bolt was in a different class once again as he reached tonight's 200m final despite slowing down with 60m of his semi-final left. Britain's Christian Malcolm also qualified but Marlon Devonish did not. \"I always said that as long as I am injury-free I am good enough to make finals,\" said Malcolm. \"I think besides Bolt it is pretty wide open. I am a little bit surprised how easy he is making it look but anything can happen in a final.\"</p> <p>Jade Johnson held her nerve to reach the final of the long jump with her last attempt at qualifying. After two disappointing efforts Johnson, the 2002 European and Commonwealth silver medallist who no longer receives lottery funding, hit the take-off mark almost perfectly before clearing 6.61 metres, 2cm beyond the automatic qualifying distance. </p> <p>It was a tremendous performance but it may not be enough for a medal in Friday's final. Britney Reese, of the United States, jumped the farthest with 6.87m, while Sweden's Carolina Kluft looked ominous. She took one jump, hitting 6.70m, and that was enough. \"I like to leave things to the last minute,\" said Johnson. \"I don't know what my problem is.\" </p> <p>Goldie Sayers, Britain's No1 javelin thrower, had a huge smile across her face as she qualified in style, reaching 62.99m in the second round to ensure her place in tomorrow night's final. </p> <p>Emily Freeman is through to tonight's 200m semi-finals, where she has been drawn in the lane outside the favourite, Allyson Felix of the US. Martyn Rooney will run in the 400m final after a personal best of 44.60 took him to second place in his heat.</p>",
  "<p>There are hidden depths to Victoria Pendleton's bubbly girl-next-door persona. After she crossed the line in the second leg of her final against Anna Meares, taking the title that has been her sole goal since 2004, she said something to herself while whizzing round the banking, before lifting her arms in triumph. She could not recall what the words were, \"and I don't think I could repeat them if I did remember\".</p> <p>The Queen of British track racing might have said something not totally regal but that was understandable. Pendleton is an utterly driven athlete who had this one single chance to take a gold medal - unlike Chris Hoy, who at least had two back-up events if he slipped up in one - and she had to keep her patience until the final hour of the final day before her moment came. Not surprisingly, later on, she was overwhelmed, to the extent that she could not distinguish one ride from another when looking back.</p> <p>That barely mattered: they were all perfect. She was never truly threatened, not because the opposition were not up to the task but because she was in total control of each round from the moment on Sunday when she qualified in an Olympic record time. A cast-iron will to dominate is the key element in a successful match sprinter and Pendleton has developed that since her inglorious exit in Athens when by her own admission her mind simply was not strong enough.</p> <p>What is astonishing with Pendleton is the difference between her clinical racing style and her regular admissions that she is a bag of nerves. The man who has enabled her to master her emotions at the times that matter is the team psychiatrist, Steve Peters, the key to her success she said yesterday: \"The psychology of what drives me as a person has been essential, getting everything in perspective, getting me in the right mind-frame. My expectations were too high. I was beating myself up psychologically at every moment. It was knocking me back.\"</p> <p>\"Just one more ride,\" whispered Peters to Pendleton before she set off to face Anna Meares of Australia in the second of the two rounds. It was straightforward: a jump down the penultimate banking to take the lead going down the back straight, the definitive acceleration down the straight, a narrow lead on the final banking and a chasm between the two of them by the line. A few laps warm down and she collapsed into the arms of the tactics coach, Jan van Eijden, the man who takes her round the velodrome in Manchester with an elbow in the ribs here and a shoulder barge there to get her used to the physical stuff.</p> <p>The emotion was understandable. Pendleton had to endure a nerve-jangling two days before she even took to the track. No wonder she said that once she had the gold medal around her neck, she felt \"like I've been waiting for ever\". Asked how she spent the wait, she replied: \"I painted my nails a few times, watched the TV, struggled to find something to eat because obviously you haven't much of an appetite, went on the rollers, just biding my time. It was very tough, harder than I anticipated, especially with the success of the team. On some days I was very emotional in a good way because it's good to see your team win and it was awesome to see my team-mates win.</p> <p>\"The pressure was mounting because I wanted to do what they've done and win a medal. It was important to be part of that. This week, watching the guys perform gave me some experience of what it must be like being a parent. I was a mess watching them and there was nothing I could do because they were on TV. I was like 'woh, is that how my mum and dad feel, because that is awful' and I felt quite guilty. How dare I inflict that on someone else?\"</p> <p>Afterwards Pendleton thanked her coaches, including one man who is not here, the English Institute of Sport weight training coach, Mark Simpson, \"for kicking my arse\" during the process that has put muscle on her slender shoulders. Her sessions under Simpson's watchful eye in the gym in the Manchester Velodrome are so intense they can be almost painful to watch but the punishment paid off last night.</p> <p>On the day that her team-mate and \"hero\" Hoy became a triple gold medal-winning legend, it should be pointed out that no one will ever know whether or not Pendleton might have been capable of something similar because the cycling powers that be and the International Olympic Committee has deprived her and her fellow women of the chance to do so. The disparity between women's and men's track events - seven to three - is grotesque in what passes for an age of equality. Pendleton will still be racing in London assuming the younger generation have not elbowed her out and it is to be hoped that by then she will have more than a single medal to go for.</p>",
  "<p>Terry Edwards, Britain's performance coach, was experiencing the rough side of life two weeks ago. The world champion Frankie Gavin's failure to make the lightweight limit at 60kg had cast a shadow over the team, with accusations that they were unprofessional and underprepared.</p> <p>But yesterday was much easier for Edwards. Just a day after the super-heavyweight David Price had fought his way into the semi-finals and a guaranteed medal, he was followed by Sunderland's light-heayweight Tony Jeffries, who recorded a 10-2 win over the Hungarian Imre Szello. </p> <p>Not since 1972, when the light-flyweight Ralph Evans, the bantamweight George Turpin and the light-middleweight Alan Minter all won bronze, has Britain had more than one boxing medallist. They could make it three this year because James DeGale fights in the middleweight quarter-finals today, against Bakhiytar Artayev of Kazakhstan.</p> <p>\"There was a lot of talk [after Gavin departed] but the team never felt down,\" said Edwards. \"We stuck together and this is a great success, not only for Beijing but for London, with so many of these guys intending to stay around for 2012.\" </p> <p>Edwards was impassioned about the systems and preparation that have brought the team to this point. They have brought with them details of 2,500 fights, digitally stored so that boxers and coaches can check on opponents and determine strategy. They have motivational tapes, too, that the fighters watch each day.</p> <p>Preparation made the difference for Jeffries. He fought Szello only eight weeks ago at the EU Championships in Poland and won by a single point. But this fight was altogether different. Jeffries' first punch, a haymaker right after nine seconds, was his worst. When he settled and started punching in straighter lines, he was very effective. He edged the first round 2-1 but in the second it felt like every other time he went forward, he scored a point. Seven scoring shots in two rounds effectively ended it as a contest.</p> <p>The final score was 10-2 and the Hungarian wore the face of a man who had not only lost, but could not understand how he could have won. \"We've worked really hard on the tactics,\" said an upbeat Jeffries, \"In the last fight against Eleider Alvarez [won on a countback], I was nervous and tense. I would rather have boxed in the first round and not got the bye. Over the last two years I've dedicated my life to this. It's unbelievable getting a medal. It's the proudest moment of my life. \"</p> <p>The 23-year-old also played down thoughts of stepping up to the professional ranks. \"I've never been that interested,\" Jeffries said. \"Hopefully my funding will increase now for the 2012 Olympics. I've had my ups and downs and a couple of years ago I was on a bit of a down. But my family and girlfriend and all of Sunderland have been brilliant, and I really thank them all. Everybody in this country would love to go to the Olympics and I've done that. I'm very proud to be British and to win a medal and help Great Britain on the medal table. \" </p> <p>Kenny Egan will be Jeffries' semi-final opponent on Friday. The Irish southpaw defeated the wayward Brazilian Washington Silva in his quarter-final, stopping him in his tracks with a lovely straight left to the head. Egan, whose best result was a bronze at the 2006 European Championship, won the fight without being touched, the final score being 8-0.</p> <p>Jeffries and Egan have history, too, having also clashed in Poland two months ago with Egan leading 14-7 when Jeffries was withdrawn before the final round with a cut eye. \"Jeffries said to me after the fight that I was a lot better than he thought I was, which was cheeky thing to say,\" Egan said at the time. \"But it's something I'll remember, believe me.\" It looks like Jeffries will need those fight videos and the motivational tapes once again.</p>",
  "<p>Compared to the polar bear, the American pika is downright tiny.</p> <p>Weighing only 4 ounces to 6 ounces, this small, rabbit-like mammal with thick brown hair that lives on boulder-covered slopes near alpine meadows in western US mountain ranges, could represent the latest effort to use the Endangered Species Act to combat global warming.</p> <p>Environmentalists filed a lawsuit today in US district court in Sacramento, California, to force the Bush administration to decide whether to list the pika for protection under the act. </p> <p>The lawsuit claims the animal is threatened by rising temperatures and says the US fish and wildlife service has dragged its feet for months on whether to list it.</p> <p>In May, the polar bear was protected as a threatened species under the act. But Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne made clear at the time that the Endangered Species Act was not intended to regulate global climate change.</p> <p>Kempthorne said it would be \"inappropriate\" to use the Endangered Species Act to control greenhouse gas emissions from automobiles, power plants and other sources. He said the polar bear listing would be accompanied by \"administrative guidance\" and an administrative rule to limit any unintended harm to the US economy.</p> <p>Environmentalists dispute the White House approach.</p> <p>\"We disagree with the administration that the Endangered Species Act isn't a perfectly appropriate act to address global warming,\" said Greg Loarie of Earthjustice, an environmental legal firm representing the Centre for Biological Diversity in the lawsuit.</p> <p>Loarie said the pika, which is intolerant of high temperatures, is an appropriate animal to test their contention.</p> <p>\"The pika is very much the polar bear of the Lower 48 [states],\" he said.</p> <p>The fish and wildlife service had no comment on the lawsuit.</p>",
  "<p> <a href=\"http://www.gamedaily.com/articles/news/primary-wii-gamer-in-us-households-is-young-males-ndash-magid/?biz=1\">According</a> to GameDaily, US research firm Frank N. Magid Associates has been surveying Wii fans to find out who's been buying Nintendo's hugely successful machine. And the key finding may surprise you.</p> <p>Although we've been led to believe that it's non-gaming consumers who're driving Nintendo's business, it turns out that, in 73% of households the primary Wii gamer is - a young male. It's only in the category of secondary Wii gamer - i.e. the person who comes along and has a go, but isn't the owner of the console - that things equal out, with 45% of households counting women in this sector.</p> <p>If you look at the games coming out for Wii, while there are plenty of Wii Sports-style casual mini-game romps, there are plenty of traditional Nintendo titles - cute, cheerful, but relatively demanding and conventional in terms of genre. Check out the <a href=\"http://www.metacritic.com/games/wii/\">Metacritic page for Wii</a> and you'll find very few of those beloved mainstream titles amid the big scorers - it's stuff like Super Mario Galaxy, Legend of Zelda and Resi 4. Of course critical opinion is no reliable guide to consumer behaviour, but it's an indication of how seriously the machine is treated by gaming veterans.</p> <p>In the end, maybe Nintendo still needs us more than a lot of people thought it did.</p>",
  "<p>Delaware senator <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/24/us/politics/24biden.html\">Joe Biden</a>'s greatest strength - foreign policy - is not just about his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 as chairman of the foreign relations committee, but his deep knowledge and ability to see the whole chess board. When war erupted in Georgia, Biden didn't need a staffer to explain what's at stake - <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/08/18/politics/politico/thecrypt/main4360945.shtml\">he already knew</a>. <br> Biden's stock as a potential running mate has <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-joe-biden-georgia-080818-ht,0,840643.story\">climbed</a> as foreign events have dominated the headlines in recent weeks. But Biden wouldn't be content with playing defence, which isn't in his nature. He wouldn't just shore up Obama's foreign policy flank. He helps Obama go on the attack, which is surely a consideration when running against a candidate who still supports an unpopular war.<br> And for those who dismiss diplomacy as sissy stuff, Biden would be the embodiment of muscular diplomacy. Students of history may recall the way Lyndon Johnson ruled the Senate before becoming president, which came to be called the <a href=\"http://www.uiowa.edu/~commstud/resources/nonverbal/lbj.htm\">Johnson treatment</a>. He would lean in on a colleague when making an argument, grasp him by the shoulder and get in his face. Few could withstand him in a one-on-one conversation when he subjected them to the full force of his personality and tower over them with his six foot, three inch frame. <br> I've seen the Biden treatment in action. When he is fully engaged with a subject, whether Nato or crime or his Iraq plan, he brings the full force of his personality and intellect to bear on his audience. Anyone who's been up close with him doesn't easily forget the experience. I can imagine the Biden treatment on the world stage. World leaders, most of whom already know him, would have a hard time dismissing his argument. The guy just doesn't let up. In terms of temperament, Biden is hot to Obama's cool - a useful quality for a candidate more inclined to seek common ground than go on the attack. When Obama criticises McCain, he keeps his cool (has anyone ever seen him angry?) and takes a gentle, almost mocking tone. But when Biden takes aim at you, you will know you're being shot at. Joe Biden would be the smartest and most scathing attack dog of the top candidates being considered - surely a consideration given the negative tone the McCain campaign has taken. He gave us the most succinct put-down of a rival in the campaign last November when he <a href=\"http://www.concordmonitor.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=\" 20071101 news01 711010358 1043 news01\">dismissed Rudy Giuliani by saying</a>: \"There's only three things he mentions in a sentence: a noun, a verb and 9/11.\"<br> Biden demonstrated his willingness to stand up for Obama when he went on the attack against opening up more coastal waters to offshore drilling, <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/25313596/page/3/\">pointing out</a> that oil companies were pumping oil from only 10 million acres of the 41 million acres of offshore leases they already control.<br> And let's not forget Biden's speaking prowess. He is probably the second best orator in the campaign. He can go from full roar to quiet as a whisper and still command your attention. He has the all too rare ability to ratchet up the intensity while lowering the volume - an effect that cannot be fully captured on television. Whether or not he gets the nod as Obama's running mate, I am looking forward to seeing how he takes charge of the room when he speaks next week at the Democratic convention.</p> <p><em>Note: this article was written before the Obama campaign confirmed that Biden would be his running mate.</em></p>",
  "<p>Shamili Okropiridze's slippers were still lying inside the front porch. In the kitchen his plates were neatly stacked. On the table lay a photograph album with black and white snaps of him showing off his muscles and relaxing on the Soviet Black Sea coast. </p> <p>But the only remnant of the man himself was the dark bloodstain on his front gate and the lingering smell of death. </p> <p>Russians or Ossetians, it's not clear who, shot Okropiridze dead on August 12. He had heard the rumble of approaching tanks and peered out into the street. Russia's war machine swept through his village Tkviavi last week, just a few miles away from the breakaway republic of South Ossetia. Someone had broken into his bedroom - putting a neat shot through the glass window, not far from the photographs of his parents hanging in the living room. </p> <p>\"His body lay on the street for a week. It turned black. We wanted to bury it but the Russians wouldn't allow us,\" said his neighbour Rusvelt Metrikuli, 63, adding: \"Shamili lived alone. His daughter was in Tbilisi. He just looked out and they killed him.\" </p> <p>Metrikuli said that the South Ossetian and Chechen paramilitaries, who had advanced on the town of Gori, returned, looting, burning and killing. \"People were scared. We ran away. I've been hiding in a field for the past 14 days\" </p> <p>The scale of ethnic cleansing in the district nine miles north of Gori was strikingly apparent today, as an aid convoy threaded its way along a dirt track towards the few residents who had stayed. Many houses along the road had been burned and looted; most locals had fled. The village shop had been ransacked. In the next hamlet of Karbi, two miles away, Jemal Saginashvili, 72, showed where a Russian cluster bomb had landed in his apple and plum orchard. His trees had been charred and blackened; bits of the bomb - serial number 1086119767 - laid scattered. </p> <p>The roof of his bedroom had been staved in while the walls of the neighbouring house had been sprayed with shrapnel. \"My relative Dodo got a large piece of metal in the lung. She was covered in blood. We summoned an ambulance to take her to hospital but she died,\" Saginashvili said. Today a few elderly men and women appeared on the streets, some crying and at least one drunk. The first humanitarian supplies were arriving in three yellow buses including sacks of flour and noodles. </p> <p>Back in Tkviavi, Russian soldiers were laughing and skinny-dipping in the Patara Liakhvi river, their khaki tents spread out on along a willow-lined bank. Others were digging trenches, reading or smoking. In Gori, as elsewhere in Georgia, there was no sign of the pullout promised by Moscow. Armoured vehicles blockaded roads and there were checkpoints in and out of the city. </p> <p>\"They have taken dozens of new positions. They are in control of the main entrances and exits of the city. This is an occupation, no doubt,\" Alexsandre Lomaia, Georgia's national security secretary, said. </p> <p>Asked why the Russians kept on promising to leave, but failed to do so, he said: \"They give different answers depending on how much vodka they have had to drink. I'm serious.\" </p> <p>In many Georgian villages north of Gori there were signs of destruction: looted petrol stations; the upturned ribcage of a dead cow; dumped tractors. At the crossroads in Tirdznisi were the remains of a minibus hijacked and shot up by a South Ossetian gang. The bus lay on its side; a corpse had been dumped in the grassy verge; nearby were shoes, broken glass and abandoned passports. \"The bus was going to Tbilisi. The Ossetians stopped it and took some people hostage. Others escaped,\" Tariel Gulisashvili said. \"Five people from the bus are missing.\" </p> <p>Others said their village Eredvi had been razed to the ground in an apparent attempt to drive Georgians from the land they had occupied for centuries. Tkviavi and neighbouring villages, says Moscow, lie in a \"security zone\" which Russia intends to occupy indefinitely. </p> <p>On Monday soldiers finally disposed of Okropiridze's corpse, burying him in his garden beneath a trailing vine. Inside the house, his bag had been packed ready for a quick departure. </p> <p>\"There used to be 2,000 of us here, including Shamili,\" Metrikuli said. \"But now there are just 20 of us left.\"</p>",
  "<p>Hosting the Olympics, China had a golden opportunity to show the world how it has changed. While it did just that in the economic and cultural sphere, with its dazzling opening ceremony, China has manifestly failed to live up to its promises on human rights. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/7733097\">confiscation of 315 Bibles</a> from four American Christians in Kunming airport yesterday is just the tip of the iceberg. </p> <p>On August 10, for example, a well-known Christian activist, <a href=\"http://dynamic.csw.org.uk/article.asp?t=press&amp;id=759\">Hua Huiqi</a> was arrested when he tried to attend the same church service as President Bush. He subsequently managed to escape. Two weeks earlier, in Inner Mongolia, Wang Shuang, a preacher, was arrested and is among four Christians jailed. <a href=\"http://dynamic.csw.org.uk/article.asp?t=press&amp;id=759\">Family members report</a> that he was hung by handcuffs in prison.</p> <p>The dramatic <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/7541832.stm\">footage</a> of the BBC's John Simpson conducting an interview with Pastor Zhang Mingxuan from detention in a police station sent the world a powerful message. Zhang said he was being detained because the authorities were \"afraid I will tell you how bad human rights are\".</p> <p>It is unarguable that China today is very different from 30 years ago. Under Mao Zedong's rule, the church was driven completely underground. Now, the picture is more complex. Some of the country's 80 million or more Christians worship in open churches which, while state-controlled, are at least public. It is no longer a crime to own a Bible, and a government-sponsored printing house claims to publish 8,000,000 copies a month. And even the experience of those who choose to attend unregistered house churches varies. In some parts of the country, the authorities more or less leave them alone, while in others they crack down harshly. </p> <p>But even though Bibles are now printed, their distribution is still limited \u2013 and controlled. They are available in some bookshops and in state-sanctioned churches, but for many Christians, especially in rural areas, it is still difficult to get a Bible. Demand continues to outstrip supply.</p> <p>Far more serious, however, than the availability of Bibles is the detention and torture of Christians. In the months leading up to the Olympics, the Chinese government launched an intense campaign against Christians. In February, 21 <a href=\"http://www.premier.org.uk/news/current/more concern for christians in china.aspx\">prominent Christian leaders</a> were sentenced to re-education through labour in what one agency, <a href=\"http://chinaaid.org/\">China Aid Association</a>, described as the largest mass sentencing of house church leaders in 25 years. The number of foreign Christians expelled in the past year has reached a level not seen for 50 years, the group claims.</p> <p>Today, China Aid Association reported <a href=\"http://chinaaid.org/2008/08/18/secret-crackdown-campaign-prepared-in-china-against-independent-church-leaders-and-freedom-defenders/\">a secret directive</a> from the central committee of the Communist party of China, distributed to all law enforcement agencies, instructing them on a new campaign against house church Christians and other \"unstable social elements\", to begin in October. Such developments indicate that China appears to have learned nothing from the Olympics. Even with the spotlight shining right on them, the repression goes on. One activist, Pastor <a href=\"http://dynamic.csw.org.uk/article.asp?t=press&amp;id=754\">Eddie Perez Romero</a>, an American church leader and professor, transformed <a href=\"http://dynamic.csw.org.uk/article.asp?t=press&amp;id=753\">two hotel rooms</a> into protest sites, painting slogans about human rights and depicting the torture that continues in China's jails. Video footage is available <a href=\"http://exodus8one.org/blog/\">here</a>. That was a bold act and one that should be applauded. But it has had little impact on China. \"One world, one dream\" is a slogan in tatters.</p>",
  "<p>Via <a href=\"http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/ezraklein\">Ezra</a>, an amusing development and a <a href=\"http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/ezraklein_archive?month=08&amp;year=2008&amp;base_name=the_return_of_harry_and_louise\">clever piece of political jujitsu</a>. Harry and Louise, the tv-commercial-land couple who helped sink <br>the Clinton healthcare plan, have returned. Same actors, same sort of stage set. </p> <p>But this time, instead of starring in an insurance-industry commercial, they're in an ad sponsored by groups that support reform and universal (or near-universal) coverage. Well, for the most part; Ezra reports the details. But this was a smart idea on someone's part, and hopefully this ad campaign will continue if Obama is elected and when he proposes his healthcare reform legislation.</p>",
  "<p>Negotiations for the creation of a transitional government in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/zimbabwe\">Zimbabwe</a> are at a serious impasse. They were suspended last week, with chief mediator Thabo Mbeki saying that while a <a href=\"http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-08/13/content_9275517.htm\">break was needed</a> to give opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai an opportunity to reflect on remaining sticking points, most of the issues were resolved. But shows of optimism by the South African president or anyone else are wholly premature. The most critical matter of all \u2013 who will actually run Zimbabwe \u2013 is no closer to resolution.</p> <p>If Tsvangirai is taking time to reflect, he is completely justified. Since his Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) won the historic parliamentary elections and he defeated Robert Mugabe in the first round of the presidential poll on March 29, his popular mandate has been clear and unsullied by the June 27 presidential runoff, which he was forced to quit in the face of extreme violence against his supporters.</p> <p>Tsvangirai has been entrusted by Zimbabwe's people to lead the country out of its troubles, and he cannot hope to do that if he accepts anything less than a transfer of the reins of power.</p> <p>At the outset, an agreement seemed possible, making Tsvangirai head of government with full executive powers and leaving Mugabe as ceremonial head of state with a \"father of the nation\" role. Tsvangirai made significant concessions: Mugabe would retain some powers such as the right to declare war, would co-chair the cabinet, and could make some appointments of some key government posts in consultation with him.</p> <p>But Mugabe <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/14/zimbabwe\">refuses to cede</a> any serious executive power. Hardly surprisingly, Tsvangirai has rejected outright his demand that he keep the power not only to reshuffle the cabinet but also to fire the prime minister. Mugabe did concede that the supervision of ministries could be shared, with Tsvangirai overseeing those such as finance, foreign affairs, industry and commerce, and local government. But all the security ministries \u2013 defence, home affairs, and intelligence \u2013 would report to Mugabe directly. And Mugabe would continue to chair the securocratic clique known as the joint operation command (JOC), his primary instrument for retaining power, and responsible for much of the recent ugly violence.</p> <p>Though Mugabe wears no general's uniform, for all practical purposes his is a military dictatorship, relying on the support of the military establishment, and brute domestic force, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/15/zimbabwe\">to cling to power</a>. Tsvangirai, rightly, has refused to accept being rendered impotent and irrelevant on internal security issues, arguing instead for the JOC to be reconstituted as a jointly chaired national security council, professionalised and disconnected from Zanu-PF and Mugabe himself.</p> <p>Despite the evident reasonableness of Tsvangirai's position \u2013 too moderate for some of his supporters' taste \u2013 he has been cast by <a href=\"http://www.mg.co.za/article/2008-08-16-zim-talks-end-is-in-sight-says-mbeki  \">Mbeki</a> as the more intransigent party, and borne nearly all the pressure imposed by a mediator whose impartiality continues to be called into question. Meanwhile, there is no sign that Mbeki's co-mediators \u2013 Jean Ping of the African Union, Jorge Chikoty of the Southern African Development Community; and the UN's Haile Menkerios \u2013 will be able to counterbalance his role with effective pressure of their own on Mugabe.</p> <p>The opposition leader has very good reason for holding absolutely firm in the talks to acquire the powers that are rightly and democratically his, and which he needs if he is to begin to be able to bring Zimbabwe back from its unutterably miserable current economic and social dysfunction.</p> <p>Tsvangirai's ace is that he holds the key to Zimbabwe's international acceptance. There is ample potential support from the US and EU to rebuild Zimbabwe's shattered economy and society, to tackle the public finance system that has permitted the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7569894.stm\">hyper-inflationary meltdown</a>, and to implement specific reforms, such as restructuring the justice sector, and professionalising the security sector. The World Bank, the IMF and the African Development Bank are all able and willing to play major roles in the country's macro-economic stabilisation.</p> <p>What global political and institutional leaders need to do is to make even more loudly and publicly clear than they have already that any negotiated agreement, in order to be credible, to get sanctions lifted, and above all to open the door to critical new international assistance, must provide Tsvangirai with essential executive powers, including control over the key elements of internal security, and that support will only be delivered, and sustained, if minimum benchmarks are observed. That basic sentiment is out there, but it has to be more explicitly articulated.</p> <p>Short of a deal that can really enable the MDC leader to move the country in the direction the Zimbabwean people have entrusted him to take, the international message must continue to be that the results of the June 27 presidential runoff are illegitimate, political violence is completely unacceptable, and the solution to Zimbabwe's political and economic crisis can only come through a properly negotiated process, producing a genuinely workable government that reflects the current popular will.</p>",
  "<p>When I was a kid growing up in south-west London, sneaking into the cinema involved loitering near some wheelie bins outside a side entrance, waiting for an accomplice to open a door from the inside the theatre and hoping the usher didn't notice the chink of light or the sudden surge of brats scuttling in. </p> <p>In other words, it involved guile, suspense and the highest of high stakes. These days, at least in New York multiplexes, sneaking in is a doddle. At cinemas whose screens number in the dozens, standard procedure is to check your ticket when you enter the complex rather than the auditorium where your particular movie is playing; once you're in, you've got the run of the place. Buy a ticket for a lunchtime show and you can emerge after dark, bleary-eyed, gorged on screen-hopping and feeling a little bit dirty and ashamed.</p> <p>Like downloading shared music or watching pirate DVDs, it's an essentially dodgy practice that is still sometimes irresistibly tempting to the economically-minded and the curious. Filmgoing is cheaper in the US than the UK, but still not the bargain it used to be, and the siren call of a pumping, muffled soundtrack as you walk past an unmanned door can be inarguable \u2013 especially when it's something you wouldn't shell out for but can't help wondering about. </p> <p>Show me a trailer for the new Indiana Jones or X-Files movie, and the rational part of my brain will tell me it looks like rubbish, sounds like rubbish and smells like rubbish. My inner fanboy, however, will prick up his ears. (What if it's actually really fun on the big screen?) Ordinarily, the good angel will win, but now I can indulge the dark side too, as well as the neck-craning gawper in me that craves a glimpse \u2013 just a glimpse, mind \u2013 of catastrophe. Having paid good money to see WALL-E earlier in the summer, I gained a peculiar satisfaction \u2013 you might even call it schadenfreude \u2013 from ducking into the final act of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull and then the opening quarter-hour of The Love Guru, and confirming that, yes, the former was slapdash and unsatisfying and the latter a steaming mound of elephant dung. All of the scoffing with none of the niggling curiosity or resentment at wasted money. </p> <p>Like pirated music or DVDs, the practice also highlights the feelings of entitlement, even disposability, that can hover around entertainment products. I've always been loathe to walk out on a film halfway through, even if I'm not enjoying it, in much the same way as I'll always read to the end of a novel. Call it a sense of obligation, right or wrong. (Aged 13, I felt a giddy, transgressive thrill walking out of The Hunt for Red October because I decided I'd had enough of red lights, klaxons and Sean Connery's beard.) But these days, I'm so accustomed to viewing clips and extracts of movies online that I think nothing of having a nibble and throwing it back if I'm not keen. It's an approach some marketing strategies have encouraged, with the opening scenes of films like The Golden Compass posted online by the studios themselves.</p> <p>Having all those big screens at your disposal can inspire a feeling of luxurious waste, like using several fresh towels in a hotel room just because you can. And it's pretty much a victimless crime: you hand over your money for a film you actually want to see, and there's no obvious harm in taking up an empty seat in another auditorium or two for a bit on your way out. (I, for one, would never countenance occupying a seat at a sold-out Friday night show, for instance.) But like channel-surfing on TV, screen-hopping is generally a pretty hollow experience, tending to confirm the feeling that nothing worth watching is really on. Plus there's always a chance of being caught red-handed, as happened to a friend of mine recently. And being frogmarched to the box office is, I'm told, considerably less thrilling as a grown-up than as a kid.</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama is reportedly <a href=\"http://voices.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2008/08/18/veep_week_speculation_hits_fev.html\">finalising his choice for a running mate</a> and preparing to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/19/us/politics/19veep.html?ex=1376798400&amp;en=43db2b379b53a6a0&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink\">text the news to his supporters</a> in the next few days, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/19/us/politics/19veep.html?_r=1&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;oref=slogin&amp;adxnnlx=1219154658-nqm8e893K5kKpw7YpkJU3w\">perhaps as early as Wednesday</a> morning. And despite a brief, not-very-serious boomlet last week, that person is not likely to be John Forbes Kerry, the junior senator from Massachusetts and the 2004 Democratic candidate for president.</p> <p>Kerry, of course, is not the only Massachusetts pretender in the vice-presidential sweepstakes. Former governor Mitt Romney, defeated by John McCain in the Republican primaries, would appear to be very much alive. Still, you can't help but get the feeling that if McCain didn't, well, you know, hate Romney's guts, he'd have already tapped the man who <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/politics/politicalintelligence/2008/02/romney_put_in_4.html\">spent $42m on his own campaign</a> and still has plenty where that came from.</p> <p>It's been a long dry spell for those of us who live in Massachusetts, one of the few enclaves where politics is followed as avidly as sports or <a href=\"http://www.americanidol.com/\">American Idol</a>. We haven't elected a president since John Kennedy in 1960. It's a sign of desperation that we've been reduced to getting excited about the vice-presidency, which, as one holder of that office, <a href=\"http://www.nndb.com/people/358/000054196/\">John Nance Garner</a>, memorably observed, is \"not worth a bucket of warm piss\".</p> <p>That said, there's an argument to be made that Kerry and Romney might be the best possible choices. Hear me out.</p> <p>I don't recall Kerry's name coming up at all until last Wednesday, when <a href=\"http://thephoenix.com/BLOGS/talkingpolitics/archive/2008/08/13/vp-john-kerry.aspx\">David Bernstein</a> of the Boston Phoenix picked up on some cable chit-chat by Hillary Clinton spokesman Howard Wolfson. Within hours, longtime Kerry tormenter <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/sep/13/stateofselfindulgence\">Jon Keller</a> of WBZ-TV (Channel 4) was <a href=\"http://cbslocalblogs.prospero.com/WBZ_Keller?entry=97\">pushing the idea</a> on his blog, and he <a href=\"http://cbslocalblogs.prospero.com/WBZ_Keller?entry=101\">followed it up</a> on Friday. That, in turn, led to a photo of Obama and Kerry on the <a href=\"http://www.drudgereport.com\">Drudge Report</a>, over the caption \"NO WAY?!\"</p> <p>Well, why not? At the moment, it looks like Obama may be leaning toward senator Joe Biden of Delaware, who was <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/thecrypt/0808/Biden_calls_for_1_billion_in_emergency_aid_to_Georgia.html\">dispatched to the war-torn republic of Georgia</a> earlier this week. Biden is thought to have the edge over the likes of Indiana senator Evan Bayh and Virginia governor Tim Kaine because of his foreign-policy experience. But Kerry's is at least as impressive. And given Kerry's near-victory in his presidential run four years ago, he's someone who has already established a certain comfort level with the electorate.</p> <p>Biden has a well-known foot-in-mouth problem (remember his <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/01/31/biden.obama/\">observation</a> that Obama was the first black candidate who's \"clean\" and \"articulate\"?) <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/01/AR2006110102513.html\">So does Kerry</a>, to be honest, but he's more disciplined than the notoriously loose-lipped Biden. Kerry and Obama also share a mutual enemy, Jerome Corsi, who's reprised his Swift Boat lies of four years ago with a <a href=\"http://mediamatters.org/items/200808150015?f=s_search\">book-length attack on Obama</a> that's currently <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/24/books/bestseller/besthardnonfiction.html\">number one</a> on the New York Times bestseller list.</p> <p>As we all know, Kerry is a bit of a stiff. But he's strong where Obama is weak. He's an experienced Washington hand who'd make a credible president should it come to that. Kerry would not be the most inspiring choice, but Obama could do worse - as he almost surely will if he picks Biden.</p> <p>Romney is simultaneously more likely to get the nod than Kerry and more problematic. His negatives are obvious. For one thing, he <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/04/AR2008020402805.html\">gives pandering a bad name</a>, having switched from moderate to conservative positions on abortion rights, illegal immigration, campaign-finance reform, gun control and embryonic stem-cell research in order to ingratiate himself with the religious right. For another, evangelical Christians still <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/16/us/politics/16veep.html?ex=1376625600&amp;en=ceca905293606c07&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink\">fear his Mormonism</a>. Then, too, <a href=\"http://wonkette.com/401151/john-mccain-reminds-mitt-romney-what-a-terrible-candidate-he-was#more-401151\">McCain's dislike of Romney</a> was visceral and obvious during the primaries.</p> <p>But Romney, like Kerry, is plausible as president, which McCain needs, given his age and <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/id/113705\">history of cancer</a>. Romney's public persona may be hard to warm up to (he's charming in small-group encounters), but he's smart, well-spoken and, as a businessman and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/nov/20/howmittgotmass\">governor</a>, proved himself to be competent, though ambitious to a fault. (<a href=\"http://thebostonphoenix.com/boston/news_features/editorial/documents/04509217.asp\">Trashing Massachusetts on the presidential campaign trail</a> while he was still governor did not go over well here.)</p> <p>Ironically, because Romney was so unconvincing as a born-again right-winger, putting him on the ticket would help to solidify McCain's image as a different kind of Republican who can appeal to moderates and independents. McCain is, in fact, a conventional conservative, but his <a href=\"http://www.democracynow.org/2008/2/4/the_myth_of_a_maverick_matt\">media-created image as a \"maverick\"</a> has proved endurable beyond all reason.</p> <p>I don't expect that either Kerry or Romney will wind up on a presidential ticket. And I realise that we Massachusetts political junkies have a vastly overblown sense of our importance.</p> <p>But if Biden spends a week defending himself after making some hideously inappropriate remark, or if McCain has a health scare that focuses attention on whatever unprepared cypher he finally settles on, well, remember: they could have done better. And they would have if they'd picked someone from Massachusetts.</p>",

  "<p>George Osborne, the shadow chancellor, will tomorrow accuse Gordon Brown of pursuing policies that are \"deeply unfair\" on the future generations who will have to pay the government debts he is accumulating.</p> <p>In a major speech to the centre-left thinktank Demos, Osborne will insist that not passing on debts to the next generation should be one of the three key characteristics of a fair society.</p> <p>Osborne will also say that a fair society is one where people are rewarded for their effort and ability, and where people can achieve their aspirations regardless of their background.</p> <p>The speech is intended to be seen as an audacious raid into Labour territory. Brown believes that Labour is the party of fairness and there have been reports that fairness will be the theme for the government relaunch being planned for the autumn.</p> <p>In his speech, extracts from which were released to the media today, Osborne will mock Labour for choosing the fairness label.</p> <p>\"I know why [Labour is using it]. I've seen the focus groups too. People like the word 'fair',\" Osborne will say.</p> <p>\"They think government is 'unfair' to those who work hard and play by the rules. They want a 'fair deal' and 'fair play'.</p> <p>\"And when you're in trouble as a political party there is a temptation to cling desperately to the words that focus groups throw up.</p> <p>\"I remember an attempted Conservative relaunch in 2003 was based on the theme 'A fair deal for everyone'. It was not a great success - indeed we lost our party leader that autumn.\"</p> <p>On the subject of \"intergenerational fairness\", Osborne will say that although this concept is less understood than other notions of fairness he can see it becoming increasingly important.</p> <p>\"We are currently on course to leave that next generation a higher national debt and the highest budget deficit of any major economy in the world,\" he will say.</p> <p>\"And, far from changing course, all the leaks and briefings coming out of the Downing Street at the moment suggest that the prime minister is preparing to try to buy his way out of trouble - by bribing people with their own borrowed money.</p> <p>\"Leaving our children to pay our debts is not fair. We already know that we face a rising bill over the years to come, from our ageing population.</p> <p>\"To add to the bill, gross fiscal irresponsibility is not just economically reckless, it is deeply unfair on future generations.</p> <p>\"We need to develop a new fiscal framework to replace the busted fiscal rules that were supposed to protect us from the short-term spending sprees of politicians out to save their own skin - a framework that fairly protects the interests of the next generation.\"</p> <p>Osborne will also repeat the long-standing Conservative claim that Labour's approach to the public services has not generated fairness.</p> <p>\"We have discovered that state attempts to guarantee fairness through monopoly provision by monolithic public services turns out to be as unfair as previous ideas of 98% tax rates and forced equality of outcome,\" he will say.</p> <p>\"So if monopoly state provision is not the answer, what is?</p> <p>\"Evidence from around the world shows that, just as a broad consensus now exists that we should be free to make our own choices and to innovate in the private sphere, so we must trust choice, competition in provision, and local decision making in public services.\"</p> <p>Commenting ahead of Osborne's speech, Treasury minister Angela Eagle said the Conservatives were in no position to attack Labour on the issue of fairness. </p> <p>\"The Labour party is delighted that the battle is to be joined on fairness when we are fighting a Tory party that, for all the talk of change, is still committed to the old unfair policies,\" she said.</p> <p>\"This is the same Tory party that opposed the minimum wage, opposed pension credit and the winter fuel allowance, opposed support for families through tax credits and still won't commit to any real pledge on child poverty. And this is the same shadow chancellor whose flagship tax policy diverts \u00a31bn to the 3,000 richest estates in the country.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Police Federation is to ask rank and file police officers in England and Wales to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/aug/14/police.tradeunions\">work to rule</a> in protest at the government's continued refusal to give officers with a pay deal that they deserve. Once again, pay negotiations with the Home Office have broken down, which will no doubt lead to the <a href=\"http://www.lge.gov.uk/lge/core/page.do?pageId=119225\">police negotiating board</a> (PNB) being unable to come to an agreement over the annual pay rise \u2013 and as happened last year, the matter being referred to the independent police arbitration tribunal. Previously the index used by the PNB to calculate our annual pay rise was the median of private sector pay, but at a time when public sector increases are going down and private sector increases continue to rise, they moved to a public sector index.</p> <p>The findings of the independent tribunal are binding to the PNB, but not to the home secretary, who can decide to ignore the findings and award whatever she pleases. Last year, this led to over 20,000 police officers marching in central London to <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7203839.stm\">protest against</a> the below inflation pay rise, in effect a pay cut.</p> <p>Police officers are prevented by law from taking industrial action (quite right, too: can you imagine the carnage on the streets of our major cities if the police went on strike?), which is why <a href=\"http://www.personneltoday.com/articles/2008/05/27/46022/paul-mckeever-takes-over-as-chairman-of-police-federation-as-jan-berry-retires.html\">Paul McKeever</a>, chairman of the police federation, will not actually call for work to rule as that would be deemed industrial action. Instead, he called for officers to ensure that they secured their full entitlements, hoping to cost the government millions in overtime payments. Often officers who make an arrest towards the end of a shift can often be caught up in red tape and paperwork for hours (typically it takes around four hours to deal with a shoplifter) meaning officers have to leave late, but seeing you are not paid for the first half an hour of overtime, if you're off an hour late, most officers won't bother claiming for half an hour. If McKeever gets his way, they will.</p> <p>Let's face it, public sector pay pales in comparison to the private sector, and so I'm sure I speak for many officers when I say we're not in it for the money. Most police officers I know have a strong social conscience and do the job for the love of it and for the sense of satisfaction in locking up criminals and making the streets safer for the public. However, considering the personal danger we place ourselves in, and the abuse we suffer daily as a matter of course, I personally don't think it's unreasonable to expect a decent level of remuneration. Especially when you consider that as members of a disciplined service we are required to present ourselves for work when ordered to do so, to deal with incidents while off duty, and are accountable for our actions, or inaction, while on or off duty.</p> <p>At the Police Federation's annual conference in May, officers voted for the right to lobby the government for the right to strike, a move I suspect was designed to scare the government into agreeing to their pay demands. I do not know of any officer who would even consider going on strike, as they know full well the consequences. Their moral compass would simply not allow it. The government knows this and so has us over a barrel, and can be as mean as they like when it comes to our pay, knowing full well that we'll still parade for duty, ready and raring to get out on the streets and deal with this country's criminals because we love the job. That makes me feel both pride and compassion for my fellow underpaid coppers everywhere.</p> <p><em>Dai Davies is a serving police officer and all views and opinions expressed are entirely his own and not those of his employers</em></p>",
  "<p>The only championship cricket of the day is being played out under heavy cloud and grey skies at the Rose Bowl, <em>writes Mike Averis</em>, where Somerset have hopes of going top of the first division - Nottinghamshire and Durham sitting out this round.</p> <p>However, any hope of rapidly reducing the three-point gap to the top were set back by morning rain, which has so far cost 24 overs, and a distinct lack of urgency in making up for lost time. At tea Hampshire are 75 for 2, having taken 36 overs getting there.</p> <p>Both wickets fell to the much-travelled Peter Trego - the second an acrobatic caught and bowled to get rid of James Adams who had toiled for almost two hours and 77 deliveries in making 18. Adams totally misjudged a slower delivery, and top-edged an ugly flat-batted shot. Trego dived and managed to get a hand beneath the ball to leave Hampshire at 60 for two.</p> <p>Earlier Andrew Caddick, captaining in place of Justin Langer, who has a bad back, and Charl Willoughby both struggled to control the swinging ball. They each bowled seven overs for 16 runs before being replaced by Alfonso Thomas and Trego.</p> <p>Thomas was tidy without threatening, bowling seven overs for nine runs. Trego picked up Michael Carberry with his eighth deliver, the opener lbw for 18 to a ball which swung back into him.</p> <p>Michael Lumb raised hopes of an increased run rate when he drove Trego twice through the onside and then chipped him through mid-wicket. At tea he is 26 not out, having hit five boundaries.</p>",
  "<p>Letting out your property could give you the freedom to move on at a time when selling has become incredibly difficult. It can allow you to move and rent elsewhere, or even buy a property without selling your own. But it also turns you into a landlord with all the responsibilities it entails. </p> <h2>Your mortgage </h2> <p>You need to get your mortgage lenders consent to let your property - failure to do so could put you in breach of the terms and conditions of your home loan. If you are planning to keep your mortgage as it is, in order to rent out your property temporarily so that you can relocate and rent a home elsewhere, then a lot of lenders may be happy to let you do so.</p> <p>If you are planning to let out your property to buy another one, however, then you may face greater barriers as you will be taking on two loans, regardless of the fact you plan to have your tenants pay off one of them. </p> <p>In this instance, you may find you need to take out a buy-to-let mortgage. These generally come with higher rates of interest and bigger upfront fees than standard owner-occupier mortgages. The buy-to-let lender will also want to know that the rent you are charging will cover the mortgage interest payments and then some. Criteria are getting tighter, and while lenders were at one stage asking for rents that cover 100% of interest payments, they are now asking for 125%.</p> <p>You will also need to tell your buildings and contents insurers that you are letting your property. If you do not you may well find that your insurance is invalid. </p> <h2>Do I need a letting agent? </h2> <p>You can let your property privately without the use of a letting agent, but using one has quite a few advantages. They will market the property for you and organise viewings, and get references from your tenants and draw up a tenancy agreement for you. </p> <p>Depending on the level of service you choose, they will also manage the property and take care of any maintenance issues, dealing directly with the tenant on your behalf. </p> <p>They will also organise rent payments and, of course, levy their fee. These can vary hugely and are dependent on the market, the property and the area it is in, but you can expect to pay 10% of the rent you receive in fees, or around 15% if you opt for a full management service.</p> <p>It is a good idea to make sure the agent is a member of a recognised body. Members of the <a href=\"http://www.arla.co.uk/default.aspx\"> Association of Residential Letting Agents</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.naea.co.uk/\">National Association of Estate Agents</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.rics.org/\">Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors</a> are all bound by a strict code of conduct. </p> <h2>How much rent to charge</h2> <p>Your letting agent will give you an estimate for the amount of rent you can expect to charge. Bear in mind that tenants may try to negotiate a lower price, so if your mortgage payments are sizeable and your margins close, you need to be careful. And when the market is flooded with rental properties be aware that, just like house sale prices, rental prices can drop.</p> <p>You should make sure you have a substantial financial buffer in place to cover a \"void,\" or a time when the property is empty between tenants. You need to know that you would be able to meet the rental or mortgage payments on the home in which you are living, as well as the one you are trying to let out.</p> <p>And, of course, you will still be responsible for the upkeep of the property. Could you cover the cost of repairing the roof or replacing the boiler? If you are planning to buy another property you will then have two roofs, two boilers and double the chance of having to pay out for maintenance. </p> <h2>Other responsibilities</h2> <p>Since April 2007, the law has stated that your tenant's deposit must be kept in a government-authorised tenancy deposit protection scheme. It is held there until the end of the tenancy when it should be returned, assuming the tenant has kept your property in good order. The idea is to protect tenants from unscrupulous landlords who blew the money or withheld it unreasonably. </p> <p>From 1 October 2008 landlords will have to provide potential tenants with an energy performance certificate outlining the energy efficiency of the building.</p>",

  "<p>Gary Glitter was today deported from Vietnam following his release from prison after serving most of a three-year sentence for child sex offences.</p> <p>The former glam rock singer, whose real name is Paul Gadd, was driven from Thu Duc prison to Ho Chi Minh City airport and put on a Thai airlines plane to Bangkok. </p> <p>He is expected to arrive back in Britain at 7.15am tomorrow, where he is likely to be met by police officers at Heathrow airport. </p> <p>The home secretary, Jacqui Smith, said she did not want him to be allowed to leave the country again.</p> <p>\"We need to control him, and he will be, once he returns to this country,\" Ms Smith told the radio station TalkSport today. </p> <p>\"It certainly would be my view that with the sort of record that he's got, he shouldn't be travelling anywhere in the world. I want Gary Glitter to be controlled whilst he's here and I don't want him to be able to go anywhere else in the world in order to abuse children.\"</p> <p>He will be made to sign the register of sex offenders, requiring him to tell the police where is living and notify police if he plans to go abroad. He could also face an order prohibiting him from going near children or using the internet.</p> <p>Vietnamese authorities forced Gadd to travel economy class after blocking his preferred choice of first or business class.</p> <p>The executive class ban for Gadd, travelling on passport number 761028553, issued to him while he was in prison, came after lawyers attempted to book a ticket back to Britain on Qatar Airways, via Doha.</p> <p>Qatar Airways refused to take him.

His sentence was later reduced for good behaviour.</p> <p>His lawyer, Le Thanh Kinh, said Gadd was looking forward to returning to Britain: \"He is OK but he is worried about his health. He has problems with his hearing and his heart.\"</p> <p>In a recent interview with the Vietnamese newspaper Cong An Nhan Dan (People's Police), Gadd said he was thinking about resuming his singing career and that he might move to Hong Kong or Singapore. However, last week he said he wanted to come back to the UK to take advantage of the health service.</p> <p>Kinh said Gadd left prison at 11.30am (5.30am BST) and that he was driven the 90 miles to the airport.</p> <p>Thu Duc is the biggest prison in Vietnam, with more than 10,000 prisoners - including about 100 foreigners. It is in Binh Thuan province, 87 miles north of Ho Chi Minh City.</p> <p>In his 1970s glam rock heyday, Gadd performed in glittery jumpsuits, silver platform shoes and bouffant wigs. He sold 18m records and recorded a string of top 10 hits.</p> <p>His most successful song, the crowd-pleasing anthem Rock and Roll (Part 2) cracked the top 10 in the US, where it continues to bring sports fans to their feet with its rousing one-word chorus: \"Hey!\"</p> <p>During the 1990s, his career faltered, although he appeared on occasional quiz shows and made variety show performances.</p> <p>His fall from grace began in 1997, when he took his laptop computer to a repair shop and an employee discovered thousands of hardcore images of children.</p> <p>Two years later, British authorities convicted him of possessing child pornography, and Gadd served half of his four-month jail term.</p> <p>He later went to Cambodia but was expelled in 2002 after children's rights advocates protested about his presence in the country.</p> <p>Gadd subsequently moved to Vietnam, where he took up residence in a seaside villa in Vung Tau, a resort town popular as a weekend getaway for residents of Ho Chi Minh City.</p> <p>Neighbours said they often heard the bald and burly Gadd singing loudly by his swimming pool and entertaining teenage girls.</p> <p>In November 2005, police launched a week-long manhunt for Gadd after allegations arose that he had been molesting girls at his villa.</p> <p>He was arrested at Ho Chi Minh City airport, where he was trying to board a flight to Bangkok. He was convicted in March last year, when the trial judge denounced him for \"disgusting and sick\" behaviour.</p> <p>The court said Gadd had molested the girls repeatedly at his villa and in nearby hotels. His sentence was reduced by three months last year for good behaviour during Vietnam's annual lunar new year prison amnesty.</p>",
  "<p>Heli Mejia Mendoza was the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia's warden, the one who kept the keys to the chains wrapped around hostages' necks.</p> <p>He publicly admitted to safeguarding dozens of men and women the rebel group kidnapped and kept captive for years, including three American defence contractors rescued last month.</p> <p>Mejia - better known as \"Martin Sombra\" - was a member of the FARC central general staff, making him the highest-ranking member of Colombia's guerrilla group ever captured, US authorities say.</p> <p>His indictment earlier this month in a Washington DC federal court on terrorism and kidnapping charges comes after a four-decade career in the jungle, which the US attorney's office said began when he was just a child.</p> <p>The US government says Mejia allegedly helped form the insurgency in the 1960s and then worked his way up to become one of the top leadership's most trusted aides.</p> <p>\"It was a concentration camp, and he was the boss,\" said Luis Eladio Perez, a former Colombian senator who was held hostage by Mejia and other FARC leaders for seven years.</p> <p>Mejia, 55, laboured in virtual obscurity until his February arrest in a city outside the capital, when a tipster got a $52,000 reward for disclosing his whereabouts.</p> <p>If extradited to the United States, Mejia will become the first person to face criminal charges for the 2003 kidnapping of the three former defence contractors since the Florida men were rescued last month - and can appear in court to testify.</p> <p>Mejia's case is another swipe at the FARC, a 44-year-old leftist insurgency classified as a terrorist organisation that has seen top leaders killed, some of its cherished hostages rescued and now its chief jailer face charges in a US court.</p> <p>Mejia is also charged with multiple counts of murder and kidnapping in Colombia, where he pleaded guilty to the 1999 taking of the Girasol military base, when two soldiers were killed and 17 taken captive. He has yet to be sentenced in that case.</p> <p>Experts say although the United States has not yet requested him, Mejia is likely to leave for Washington before he goes to trial on the kidnapping charges in Colombia, which include the senator, former presidential candidate Ingrid Betancourt, her running mate Clara Rojas and the baby Rojas had in captivity.</p> <p>But critics say Mejia should first pay for his crimes in his home country.</p> <p>\"It sends the message that the Colombian judiciary is incapable of handing out justice, or - even worse - that three Americans are worth more than dozens of Colombians,\" Perez said in a telephone interview from Bogota. \"What he did to us for seven years was what, nothing?\"</p> <p>Colombian President Alvaro Uribe has close ties to Washington - which has given $5bn in aid in recent years - so it is unlikely Bogota will refuse to hand him over, experts said.</p> <p>Perez first encountered \"alias Sombra\" in late 2003, about two years after he was captured. Perez was taken to a camp made of wood and metal wires where the three Americans had already been held for about eight months.</p> <p>The three Americans were flying in a drug surveillance plane in February 2003 when they crash-landed in FARC territory. Two men aboard were killed, and Keith Stansell, Marc Gonsalves and Thomas Howes were taken hostage until a bold military rescue last month.</p> <p>The hostages were part of a group of Colombian police, soldiers and politicians whom the FARC held in the hopes of forcing the government into a prisoner swap.</p> <p>Perez said Mejia was in charge of about 120 rebels there. He described Mejia as an approachable problem-solver who kept ample provisions of food and medicine. He was poorly educated and seemed more like a lackey than a top rebel leader, he said.</p> <p>\"He was tough, but he also could be very nice,\" Perez said. \"He liked to talk politics and talked a lot about being a young man in the Liberal Party hunted down by rivals in the Conservative Party.\"</p> <p>The US attorney's office described Mejia as one of the 44 founders of the FARC. The group was created in 1966, when Mejia was 11.</p> <p>\"The guerrillas created and formed the organisation based on peasants and children they took,\" said political consultant Mauricio de Vengoechea of Newlink Political in Miami. \"I do not think he was 11 years old and at the meeting where they formed the FARC, but it's very possible that they took him to join their ranks at that age. \"</p> <p>Mejia was charged with seven terrorism and weapons charges and faces 60 years in prison - the maximum penalty Colombian law allows for people extradited to the United States.</p> <p>In January, a US federal judge sentenced FARC leader Ricardo Palmera, known as \"Simon Trinidad,\" to 60 years in prison for conspiring to hold the Americans hostage.</p> <p>Lozano said Washington and Bogota should not expect for Mejia's criminal indictment to cause any ripple within the organisation.</p> <p>\"The FARC does not care,\" Lozano said. \"The person who is captured is captured; the one who is killed is killed. They are replaced. That's how war works.\"</p>",
  "<p>Uganda boasts of its inclusivity and its decentralisation. On paper it is a text-book example of a country with a structure of governance that should enable universal participation. There are guaranteed seats for women at every level of government; there is a female deputy president. A quarter of MPs are women, and women have been promoted to a wide range of public jobs. And there is universal primary education.</p> <p>But the official statistics belie the marginalisation, the gross inequalities, of Ugandan society, especially in rural areas and in the northern part of the country \u2013 where the state scarcely reaches. Rural Uganda is marginalised by the capital, Kampala, and within rural Uganda there are divisions by geography, tribe, gender, age and sexual orientation, an intractable web of culture and politics.</p> <p>There is progress, but the north still feels a long, long way from Kampala, further even than the five-hour drive along increasingly rough roads, the absence of the comforts of town life \u2013 electricity, water, sanitation. Its basis is not only geographical but tribal: to the Acholi of northern Uganda, and the Iteso of the north east, the Ugandan government is in the grip of another tribe. Twenty years after the final collapse of the Amin and Obote regimes of the early years of independence, people here feel they are still being punished for supporting them.</p> <p>The most enduring evidence is the lack of security. When the Lord's Resistance Army took their insurgency south to Soroti in 2003, there were only a handful of government soldiers to defend the town. Lawlessness remains a problem despite the slow spread of permanent police posts. Everyone, it seems, has a gun, and anyone who accumulates the smallest amount of wealth is vulnerable.</p> <p>There is a stark contrast between the beginnings of prosperity in a Kampala where blank glassy skyscrapers \u2013 bank headquarters and international hotels \u2013 are starting to sprout, and the deep poverty of rural villages where the only brick buildings are remnants of colonial days.</p> <p>And there is an equal contrast between the formal status of women, and the reality of their role in rural Uganda, where tribes such as the Iteso still require women and schoolgirls to kneel before men, are still sold to their husbands by their fathers, and where, whatever the land ownership laws say officially, men continue to own all the capital.</p> <p>Children without families \u2013 orphans and runaways \u2013 have no real support network. There are few government children's homes (and only a handful more run by NGOs). If to lose your parents is a disaster, to be born without even knowing your tribe deprives you not only of the support of the extended family, but of a key component of your identity.</p> <p>Nor is there effective state support for children and adults with physical or mental disability, and little effort so far to dismantle what are often insurmountable hurdles: the absence of public transport, schools inaccessible to disabled students, the lack of medical support and supplies for the chronically ill and their families.</p> <p>And in an increasingly evangelical world, homosexuality is worse than atheism. Officially, it does not exist.</p> <p>Uganda's is a society in transition. Modernisation will bring benefits, but it also erodes traditional support networks \u2013 the family, the clan, the tribe. Communities once dislocated by insecurity are now dislocated by the flight from the land. Universal primary education is a great advance; but unless, for example, there are adequate washing facilities and availability of water, girls will continue to be excluded. Development projects cannot help only a few: they have to ensure that progress is also inclusive. A lot harder than it sounds.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> Wimbledon. <br> <strong>The lineup:</strong> Joe Da Costa (vocals), Will Ritson (drums), Nick Rowson (guitars), Jonny Tams (keyboards, gadgets).<br> <strong>The background:</strong> Gold Teeth, who may or may not be named after the Steely Dan song Your Gold Teeth, only formed in February 2008 and are as yet unsigned but they're already selling out venues in London and attracting a lot of A&amp;R attention. Melody Maker once caused a minor furore for putting Suede on the cover before they'd released a note, but they had at least been going \u2013 gigging \u2013 for a while. Gold Teeth, despite their backgrounds in south London bands (they're a Wimbledon supergroup, apparently), seem to have appeared from nowhere, their MySpace doing the work of marketing departments and management, although things should speed up even more now that they've got Razorlight's team behind them. Although they've already had their first Xfm session aired, they're not planning to release anything until October, but chances are the debut single will be a track called Everybody. It's an early crowd favourite that usually sees hundreds of coloured balloons falling from the ceiling and creates a party atmosphere.<br> But what are they celebrating? Let's have a listen. Everybody has some of the currently popular tropical/Afrobeat flavours, with an electronic pulse, a lilting rhythm and Highlife guitar, but what makes it stand out is the lyric, which is self-pitying and stark where the music is anthemic and joyous: \"Everybody wants to see that you don't even look at me/No, you don't even love me,\" complains the singer, turning the plaint into something strangely affirmative via an endlessly repeated \"everybody is everybody\" refrain, which will go down well as a chant in Ibiza or Ilford. Tasty is like late-period Madness or early-period Blur, and it's hard to tell, because it's just a demo, whether the slovenly feel is a deliberate attempt to achieve a reggae-lite skank or due to sub-par performances on the part of the band, although the pre-hype doing the rounds is heavy on the individuals' instrumental prowess (\"At a mere 19 Will is an astonishing drummer, at 23 Nick is a nascent guitar God, at 23 Jonny is a producer-programmer-boffin in the making\", etc); certainly Da Costa is in full Albarn-esque mockney mode throughout. Bread and Butter and Donkey Kong Boredom also mix up ska, calypso and indie with flashes of shimmery psychedelic guitar but they're not great songs. Confused Blue is based around the beat from Bob Marley's Jammin' although minus the irie vibes \u2013 like most of Gold Teeth's songs, it's imbued with feelings of paranoia and suburban alienation, like the ska noir of the Specials. In fact, if you want to place Gold Teeth anywhere, it's between Blur circa Leisure (and maybe a less intense Happy Mondays) and the queasy MOR of the second LP by the Specials, whose squalling fairground sound Gold Teeth keyboardist Jonny Tams evokes quite nicely throughout this track and the inebriated delirium of their final MySpace offering, Roll it Over. </p> <p><strong>The buzz:</strong> \"They are without a doubt the best unsigned band I've seen play this year.\"<br> <strong>The truth:</strong> They need better songs, and obviously decent production, but the idea of a British indie band touting a sort of dark Afrobeat is appealing. <br> <strong>Most likely to:</strong> Work with Paul Epworth or Paul Oakenfold.<br> <strong>Least likely to:</strong> Work with Paul Anka or Paul Young. <br> <strong>What to buy:</strong> Gold Teeth's debut single will be released in October, although the title and the label are not yet known.<br> <strong>File next to:</strong> Blur, the Specials, Kid British, White Rabbits. <br> <strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/goldteeth\">www.myspace.com/goldteeth</a><br> <strong>Wednesday's new band:</strong> The War on Drugs.</p>",
  "<p>The excitement is building for the <strong>MediaGuardian Edinburgh International Television Festival</strong> - only three days to go folks! Feverish speculation has abounded as to who is taking part in the TV exec special of How To Look Good Naked - and who will be getting it out. Alas, Monkey can reveal that Sky1 controller Richard Woolfe will definitely not be showing Gok Wan his white bits, despite several attempts to get him to do so. However, some interesting names have emerged, none more so than Channel 4's head of press, Matt Baker, who has been spotted filming with Mr Wan. Monkey has been reassured he doesn't get naked though. Phew. Also set to take part is Richard Klein, the head of independent commissioning at BBC Knowledge. Monkey hears that at one point, Gok asked Klein to take his trousers off, but the BBC man declined to do so - as he wasn't wearing any underwear. Apparently, Gok had a peep to check and was able to confirm that the big man was indeed going commando. For those going to the festival, it will be screened at 12.30pm on Friday. For those who aren't, Monkey can almost guarantee that clips will appear on YouTube...</p>",
  "<p>America's beleaguered housing market suffered more gloom today when it was revealed that the number of new housebuilding projects started last month tumbled by 11% to the lowest annual rate in more than 17 years.</p> <p>The commerce department said the annual pace of housing starts dropped to 965,000, slightly ahead of analyst forecasts but the weakest since March 1991.</p> <p>Building permits, an indicator of future construction and a good gauge of the health of the market, also fell to a yearly rate of 937,000, well below forecasts. The report suggested that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/14/subprimecrisis.useconomy\">battered property market</a> would continue to plague the already weakened economy.</p> <p>Housebuilders are hoping the housing rescue package approved by Congress last month will boost the real estate sector. The law includes a temporary $7,500 (\u00a34,000) tax credit for first-time buyers which, in effect, works out as a 15-year interest-free loan. </p> <p>The grim figures came alongside data on producer price inflation, which revealed the highest year-on-year rise in July since June 1981 at 9.8%, reflecting July's record high spike in oil prices. Oil has since slipped markedly, but it is uncertain whether this slide will continue.</p> <p>Stripping out volatile items such as food and energy, core inflation of goods leaving the factory gate also ticked up by 3.5%, the largest annual rise since June 1991.</p> <p>The numbers did little to steady nerves on Wall Street, which were already jittery amid fresh fears that the credit crunch will cause <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/19/creditcrunch.marketturmoil\">further damage</a> to the already struggling banking sector, and force the US government to step in to rescue Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, leaving investors with almost nothing. The Dow Jones industrial average dipped 0.5% in early trading to 11,422.07 points.</p> <p>It also intensifies the dilemma facing the Federal Reserve. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/01/useconomy.usa\">Growth in the last quarter of 2007</a> fell into negative territory for the first time in six years. </p> <p>With <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/14/inflation.useconomy\">inflation already soaring</a>, today's figures suggest manufacturers will try to pass on higher costs to consumers \u2014 meaning more price pressures in the pipeline.</p> <p>Analysts said the producer price data suggested that inflation in the US economy was more systemic than past numbers may have suggested.</p> <p>\"It will continue to show up in consumer price inflation for months to come,\" said Marc Pado, strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald &amp; Co. \"We're clearly not out of the woods yet... it's going to make people very nervous about rolling into a recession.\"</p> <p>The Fed has cut interest rates aggressively from 5.25% a year ago to 2% to try to revive the flagging economy. It faces a difficult decision on whether to continue with this course of action as the prospect of recession heightens and inflation becomes more of a problem.</p> <p>\"The Fed is stuck between a rock and a hard place, and it shows,\" said Pado. \"The market is struggling a bit. We're walking a tight rope.\"</p>",
  "<p>Recent discussion and how/whether UK startups should try for a stake of the US market brought up the discussion of trade missions, and whether they are valuable.

  "<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336762497\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Business/Pix/pictures/2008/08/19/inmarsat.jpg\" alt=\"Inmarsat satellite launch\" width=\"220\" height=\"310\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>A satellite the size of a double-decker bus and weighing six tonnes was launched into space early today, completing a decade-long $1.5bn (\u00a3805m) investment by London-listed communications company Inmarsat.</p> <p>The Inmarsat-4 satellite, which has a solar panel wingspan the length of a football pitch, was carried into orbit by a Russian-made Proton Breeze M rocket from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.</p> <p>As it moves into position above the Pacific ocean over the next few weeks it will complete a global communications network for the company. There are two other Inmarsat-4 satellites in orbit.</p> <p>The launch was not just a success for Inmarsat, whose shares gained 12.5p to 500.5p on the news, but for the makers of the Proton rocket at the Khrunichev plant in Moscow. The last outing of the rocket, which was developed in the 1960s to carry nuclear warheads, ended in disaster when it deployed a US communications satellite at the wrong altitude.</p> <p>Despite that setback in March, which was the third in as many years, Inmarsat's chairman and chief executive, Andrew Sukawaty, said he was not overly concerned at being next in the launch queue.</p> <p>\"It is true that the last satellite they launched before this one was a failure but you can take that one of two ways: if you look at the history of the satellite launch business, usually the return to flight \u2014 the next one after a failure \u2014 has a very high success rate because they double check and triple check everything,\" he said. \"We even had other satellite operators calling us and wanting to buy our slot.\"</p> <p>The rocket blasted off at 11.43pm last night \u2014 4.43am local time \u2014 and just over nine hours later the satellite separated from the last stage of the rocket.</p> <p>The satellite will now take another four weeks to slot into its geosynchronous orbit. The first of its five solar panels is ready to begin charging the satellite's battery and the rest will follow over the next few weeks.</p> <p>\"But as they say in the business, 80% to 90% of the launch risk is now behind us,\" said Sukawaty. \"We held off popping the corks from the champagne bottles until this morning.\"</p> <p>\"In fact cork separation was at 9.12am,\" quipped his colleague, press officer Chris McLaughlin.</p> <p>The new satellite is 60 times as powerful as the whole fleet of its predecessors and can provide broadband at up to 500Kb per second. While that may seem low compared with the speed available to the average UK household, which is 10 times greater, it is a massive improvement on the current speed of just 64Kb per second.</p> <p>Inmarsat supplies voice and data services to governments and shipping companies who need to keep in contact with vessels at sea, and is increasingly kitting out aircraft so that passengers can surf the internet during their flight. </p> <p>Its network is also likely to be heavily used as airlines start to permit the use of mobile phones on board.</p> <p>Its equipment is also used by aid agencies in remote areas.</p>",
  "<p>In what comes as a surprise to approximately no one with basic critical thinking skills, the <a href=\"http://www.apa.org/releases/abortion-report.html\">American Psychological Association task force on mental health and abortion</a> has found that \"there is no credible evidence that a single elective abortion of an unwanted pregnancy in and of itself causes mental health problems for adult women\".</p> <p>Over the last two years, the task force reviewed and analysed \"all of the empirical studies published in English in peer-reviewed journals since 1989 that compared the mental health of women who had an induced abortion to comparison groups of women, or that examined factors that predict mental health among women who have had an elective abortion in the United States\". They found that, while some women do indeed experience negative feelings or suffer clinical depression after an abortion, there's nothing to suggest that such feelings are directly attributable to the abortion itself as opposed to other circumstances, like, say the <a href=\"http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/psrh/full/3711005.pdf\">73% of abortion seekers</a> who terminate because they can't afford a baby, for reasons ranging from unemployment to lack of healthcare to supporting the maximum number of dependents possible already. The report also notes that \"women terminating a wanted pregnancy, who perceived pressure from others to terminate their pregnancy, or who perceived a need to keep their abortion secret from their family and friends because of stigma associated with abortion, were more likely to experience negative psychological reactions following abortion\" \u2013 which suggests that fundamentalist religion might be a better indicator of post-abortion distress than abortion, ahem.</p> <p>One of the most significant recurrent problems the task force identified was \"serious methodological problems\", like a failure to control for other obvious risk factors. In addition to the aforementioned poverty and social stigma, many of the previously completed studies that claimed causation between abortion and mental distress ignored relevant indicators such as domestic violence, preexistent emotional and/or psychological problems, former or current substance abuse, and prior unwanted births. The exclusion of such evident risk factors renders any conclusion so laughably absurd it's difficult to believe an ideological agenda was not at work. Because science certainly wasn't.</p> <p>In 2005, I <a href=\"http://shakespearessister.blogspot.com/2005/12/anti-choicers-not-so-fast.html\">questioned</a> on these same grounds a Norwegian study which purported to find that women who had abortions suffer \"mental distress\" longer than women who miscarry. It made the very mistakes which the APA task force found are endemic to studies examining abortion-related distress \u2013 and I daresay the problem is that, even within the scientific community (as everywhere else, including <a href=\"http://shakespearessister.blogspot.com/2008/06/butbutbut-if-women-just-knew-troooth.html\">the US supreme court</a>), the idea women inevitably suffer distress after an abortion is taken as self-evident; these studies are coming to a foregone conclusion.</p> <p>Thing is, not all women do suffer distress after an abortion. Some women feel distress at a pregnancy, which is why they seek out abortions. Plenty of women surely feel a combination of sadness and relief after an abortion, given that, to my understanding, abortions don't eliminate the ability to hold two thoughts in one's head at the same time.</p> <p>But it's really the women who feel no regret that seems to bother and confound us. There's not a strong cultural narrative for women who are equipped to carry a child but totally don't want to, irrespective of their reasons. Most discussions of abortion axiomatically regard pregnancy as something every woman wants and to which every woman will have a special connection, which is why so much legislation is designed with the presumption that women seeking abortions have had to deny the reality of being pregnant \u2013 that if only she sees it's a baby on an ultrasound \u2026 if only she hears the fetal heartbeat \u2026 if only she just thinks about what she's doing for 24 more hours \u2026</p> <p>To the women who seek abortions, the reality of being pregnant is not something they get an abortion in spite of. It is precisely what's driving them to seek the abortion in the first place.</p> <p>Maybe if we could wrap our heads around that, we could finally wrap our heads around the idea that abortions do not cause mental distress to the women who get them.</p>",
  "<p>So Obama has sharpened his message, according to <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1833849,00.html\">this report</a> by Time's Karen Tumulty, and is now ripping into McCain:</p> <blockquote> <p>Where he would rarely even mention McCain in the past, Obama now openly mocks him. McCain boasts of putting country first, Obama said, \"but I have to say, it's not an example of putting country first when you say George Bush's economic policies have shown 'great progress.'\" As for McCain's contention that Obama would be \"an economic disaster,\" he retorted: \"Mr. McCain, let me explain to you. The economic disaster is happening right now. Maybe you haven't noticed.\"</p> <p>\u2026And he told the crowd that a top McCain economic adviser (a reference to comments by former Senator Phil Gramm) \"is calling you whiners...This guy obviously doesn't pump his own gas. He obviously doesn't do his own shopping. He's obviously not paying his own bills.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>That's all pretty good, but here's the thing\u2014the fundamental difference between most Republican attacks and most Democratic attacks, and why Republican attacks are more effective: </p> <p>When Republicans imagine attacks, they think in terms of character; when Democrats imagine attacks, they think in terms of policy and record. Read that again. It's the key to presidential campaigns.</p> <p>Look at Obama's attacks above. Basically, they're about McCain's policy positions. They're pretty good and effective, and attacks like them might prove to be enough this year, given the state of the economy and world and general lack of enthusiasm for McCain that's afoot. But they don't go right at the guy. The only character attack above is directed at someone who is now a former McCain adviser.</p> <p>The McCain attacks, by contrast, are almost all aimed at character. Obama's a celebrity, he's like Britney, he's a lightweight, he's a hypocrite and so on. They throw in some policy stuff for good measure \u2013 he's gonna raise your taxes, he's to blame for high gas prices. But the gist of the GOP strategy is to turn the other guy into a person that most Americans just wouldn't want to have as president.</p> <p>It's been this way since the 1970s. Karl Rove did it, but as usual he gets too much credit from the MSM. Lee Atwater did it before him. Atwater and James Baker and George Bush Sr. turned Mike Dukakis into a girly-man (Dukakis helped their case with his <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=michael+dukakis+tank&amp;search_type=&amp;aq=0&amp;oq=michael+dukakis+ta\">infamous tank ride</a>) who defended <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Horton\">(black) rapists</a> and was just unfit to command a great country. Roger Ailes and Nixon did it to McGovern. </p> <p>In essence, ever since the Democratic Party started defending black peoples' and women's and, later, gay people's rights, it's been fairly easy for the other side to kick loose some subconscious cobwebs in middle-Americans' brains and make Democratic men seem like, well, sissies.</p> <p>Obviously I'm not contending that Democrats should stop defending those people. They certainly should not. But what they should do is answer the Republicans in kind. </p> <p>For example, we now know that John McCain wears <a href=\"http://www.236.com/news/2008/07/31/john_mccain_caught_in_520_ferr_8049.php\">$520 shoes</a>, owns <a href=\"http://salon.glenrose.net/default.asp?view=plink&amp;id=8054\">an obscene number of homes</a> (variously placed at seven to 10) and has probably never written a check to a utility company or a home contractor or a dentist in at least 26 years (since he married La Hensley). And Saturday we learned that he thinks someone with a net worth of <a href=\"http://beltwayblips.com/story/who_s_rich_mccain_and_obama_have_very_different/\">only $4.9 million</a> is not rich. He can be painted as \u2013 and indeed is \u2013 out of touch with what regular Americans go through every day. </p> <p>If he were the Democrat, everyone in America would know the above. The Republicans would have run ads featuring those Ferragamo loafers and aerial photographs of the seven, eight, nine or 10 houses. For good measure, the script of these ads would have cleverly made sure that viewers knew that this emasculated sissy-man didn't earn a penny of the fortune that purchased all this. He married it!</p> <p>Can't do that to McCain because he's a war hero? Nonsense. It was done to John Kerry. He was a war hero. In fact, Kerry, we can safely assume based on the things I've read, killed more men in a face-to-face way than McCain ever did. That's arguably more manly than even surviving five years' torture. It can be done to anyone.</p> <p>But the Democrats just don't think this way. No, it's not that they're better human beings. They're afraid to go toe-to-toe with Republicans on these things because they figure (accurately) that Republicans have more experience at this stuff. And they're more concerned about media reaction. Republicans don't care about editorial criticism from the major newspapers \u2013 they tough it out until the charges stick. Democrats would start backing off if the Times and the Post wrote editorials taking them to task.</p> <p>In general: Democrats try to turn the Republican into someone you disagree with on the issues. Republicans try to turn the Democrat into someone you wouldn't want to live on your street or let near your children. Is it any wonder the latter is more effective?</p>",
  "<p>Nicolas Sarkozy today said he would travel to Afghanistan after 10 French soldiers were killed after Taliban insurgents attacked their patrol near Kabul.</p> <p>A three-hour gun battle broke out after the attack yesterday, 30 miles east of the capital, in the Surobi district, continuing sporadically overnight and picking up this morning, when the Nato soldiers were killed, Afghan military officials said today. A further 21 were injured. </p> <p>One Afghan source claimed four of the soldiers had been kidnapped by the insurgents and killed. </p> <p>French reinforcements in armoured vehicles joined the battle today, while other troops stopped civilian traffic from entering the area. Witnesses reported helicopters flying overhead. </p> <p>The deaths of the men, from the 8th Marine Infantry Parachute Regiment, represent the biggest single loss of life for the French in Afghanistan since the US-led invasion of 2001 ousted the Taliban regime. Before yesterday's attack, the total French death toll was 14.</p> <p>At April's Nato summit in Bucharest, Sarkozy pledged a further 700 soldiers to Afghanistan, and their arrival by the end of this month will take the French contingent, based mainly in Kapissa province, north-east of Kabul, to 2,600. </p> <p>A Taliban spokesman said insurgents had used mines and rockets to inflict \"heavy losses\" including the destruction of five French vehicles. Retaliatory airstrikes killed five militants and 15 civilians, they claimed. </p> <p>Surobi district chief Qazi Suliman put the Taliban death toll at 13.</p> <p>The French ministry of defence in Paris would confirm only that a clash involving French troops, who are with Nato's International Security Assistance Force, was ongoing. </p> <p>The attack is the deadliest upon foreign troops since 16 American soldiers were killed in June 2005 when a rocket-propelled grenade shot down their helicopter. </p> <p>Meanwhile, in the town of Khost, a squad of six suicide bombers tried to storm the main US base in south-eastern Afghanistan, three of them detonating their bomb vests, just before midnight yesterday.</p> <p>The Taliban launched several waves of attacks at the Camp Solerno base a few miles from the Pakistan border - the second largest US base in Afghanistan after the headquarters at Bagram. They were fought off and surrounded by ground forces, fighter aircraft and helicopters.</p> <p>A total of 13 insurgents, including the six bombers, died in the attack, said the Afghan ministry of defence.</p> <p>One US soldier was killed, four Afghan troops were wounded and there were a number of civilian casualties.</p>",
  "<p>Leaders of Pakistan's coalition government are meeting today to discuss who will succeed their common enemy, Pervez Musharraf, who resigned yesterday after nine years in power.</p> <p>The talks came as 23 people were killed in a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/19/pakistan.terrorism\">suspected suicide bomb blast</a> in in north-western Pakistan, highlighting the precarious security situation in the country . </p> <p>Twenty militants were killed in a separate clash with Pakistani security forces in the north west.</p> <p>Today's meeting will focus on the divisive issues of the nomination of a new president, the restoration of 60 judges sacked by Musharraf and the former president's immunity from prosecution.</p> <p>The law minister, Farooq H Naek, said today that there had been no resignation deal with Musharraf. \"He resigned himself and as far as his accountability is concerned, coalition partners will decide,\" Naek said. </p> <p>Musharraf had been seeking immunity but the coalition party led by the former prime minister Nawaz Sharif says he should face trial for treason. </p> <p>While the question of Musharraf's impeachment had brought the largely dysfunctional coalition together, analysts said there would be a tussle over who would succeed as president and whether the judges fired by Musharraf would be restored. </p> <p>Sharif wants the judiciary reinstated but Asif Zardari, Benazir Bhutto's widower who leads the Pakistan People's party, is thought to still be reticent.</p> <p>\"There's no stable settlement. These two guys [Sharif and Zardari] will now start slugging it out,\" said Najam Sethi, editor of Pakistan's Daily Times. \"The political interests of the two are diametrically opposed.\"</p> <p>Prolonged wrangling over Musharraf's position has raised concern in Washington and elsewhere that it will distract from Islamabad's efforts to tackle militants. </p> <p>A grim-faced Musharraf yesterday delivered an impassioned defence of his record on live television that lasted for over an hour. He kept the news of his resignation until the final moment, ending his almost nine years in power with \"God bless Pakistan\". </p> <p>\"If I was doing this just for myself, I might have chosen a different course but I put Pakistan first, as always,\" said the president, wearing a western suit and tie but speaking in Urdu. </p> <p>The coalition government, led by the Pakistan People Party and Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League-N, had managed to stage a bloodless counter-coup by announcing two weeks ago that they planned to impeach the president.</p> <p>Most members of the coalition government, which came to power after elections in February, did not want to go through the trauma of impeachment proceedings, hoping the threat of prosecution would be enough to convince the president to go. That strategy proved successful just two hours before parliament was due to meet to officially start the prosecution process. </p> <p>Yousaf Raza Gilani, the prime minister, said: \"Today, parliament has become sovereign. We can hold our head up high in the world and say that we too are a democracy.\" </p> <p>Raza Rabbani, a leading member of the Pakistan People's party, said: \"This is the first time in Pakistan's political history where you have the people winning against establishment institutions.\"</p> <p>The crisis that led to Musharraf's departure has been brewing for more than year. He sacked the respected chief justice in March 2007, and later declared a state of emergency. </p> <p>The popular opposition leader Benazir Bhutto was assassinated late last year, and elections in February saw the coalition government elected and determined to oust him.</p> <p>It had been predicted that Musharraf would step down as a part of a western-mediated agreement between the president and the coalition government, which would give him immunity from future prosecution. He also wanted to be able to stay living in Pakistan. </p> <p>It is thought that his terms have been met, though he suggested that no deal had been cut. </p> <p>\"I don't want anything from anybody. I have no interest. I leave my future in the hands of the nation and people,\" Musharraf said. \"Let them be the judges. Let them do justice.\" </p> <p>While there seemed to be no formal agreement, political insiders suggested that Musharraf would have received assurances from the Pakistan People's party, which leads the coalition, that would have been guaranteed by the army. </p> <p>Pakistan's people and its western allies hope that removing the president, who seized power in a 1999 coup but gave up his army uniform late last year, will mean the coalition can now get on with the business of governing. </p> <p>Musharraf leaves Pakistan in the hands of the same politicians that he had repeatedly denounced. But he admitted that he had no choice. </p> <p>\"Even if I beat this impeachment, relations between the presidency and the government can never be fixed. Pillars of the state - parliament and the judiciary - would be harmed and, God forbid, the army might have been dragged in,\" he said. \"No 'charge sheet' can stand against me because I never did anything for myself. Whatever I did, I put Pakistan first.\" </p> <p>Britain praised Musharraf yesterday but was quick to distance itself from him. \"It is important to highlight President Musharraf's commitment to tackle terrorism, to promote dialogue with India, especially over Kashmir, and to root out corruption,\" said the foreign secretary, David Miliband. </p> <p>\"But reform depends above all on legitimacy, and that is why the UK has been at pains to stress the importance for Pakistan of strong institutions rather than strong individuals, and why we believe a strong democracy is key.\"</p>",

  "<p>You may notice that from tomorrow, this blog and a few others will look a little brighter, a little flashier, a little more like ... the rest of the website. That's right, blogs are at last moving onto our new platform. We'll be doing them in two stages, but you can expect the following blogs to look a whole lot shinier very soon:</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/allotment\">Allotment blog</a></p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog\">Environment blog</a></p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/ethicallivingblog\">Ethical Living blog</a></p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/joepublic\">Joe Public</a></p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz\">Lost in Showbiz</a></p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/marketforceslive\">Market Forces</a></p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/blog\">Money blog</a></p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/mortarboard\">Mortarboard</a></p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/blog\">News blog</a></p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog\">Politics blog</a></p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blog\">Science blog</a></p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/blog\">Travel blog</a></p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth\">Word of Mouth</a></p> <p>\u2022 ... and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/insideguardian\">InsideGuardian</a>, too.</p> <p>... and it's not just a fresh lick of paint. There will be new features including improved search, new ways of getting around, and best of all a closer connection to the rest of the site. </p> <p>What can you expect to find in our new world of blogs? Here's a (not so) shortlist:</p> <p><strong>New design</strong></p> <p>We created a new design for our blogs to reflect the overall design of guardian.co.uk, and showcase the new colours, layout, graphics and navigation. They will, however, remain blog-like - posts will still appear in reverse chronological order with comments and, as before, the righthand column will contain our commercial content and related features, such as the calendar archive. All of the blogs will be getting new colours and fresh banner images. Take a look at the preview below; we hope you'll be impressed.</p> <p><strong>Keyworded links to content throughout the site</strong></p> <p>You may have noticed on guardian.co.uk that we have these clever things called keywords, which look like this: </p> <p>Keywords are useful because they allow you to browse content throughout the site by topic, even if that content is spread out across many different sections.</p> <p>However, the pesky thing about keywords until now has been that they didn't apply to blogs. So, if you clicked on the US election keyword in an article, you might be taken to other articles and videos about the US election but blogposts about the election would be left out. Now, by folding blogs into the rest of the site, blogposts will be fully linked to existing keywords on the rest of the site, and you'll be able to find them on related articles, other blogposts, even videos and audio clips.</p> <p>Also, every blogpost will be linked by keywords both locally and universally, so you'll be able to browse by related content exclusive to the blog or across all content on the site.</p> <p><strong>New navigation</strong></p> <p>We've also tweaked blog navigation for 1) user friendliness and 2) a closer relationship between the blogs and the sections they belong to. Blogs will now sit officially within their content section: Politics blog, for example, will live in the Politics section, as opposed to living in a separate 'Blogs section' of the site. This will be apparent in the URL and navigation at the top of every blog front and article page. We think connecting the blog with its section better reflects the way people naturally interact with the website.</p> <p>We've also added pagination to the blogs fronts so that you'll be able to page back to previous posts, even older ones which have been pushed off of the front page. If you want to look at a post from farther back in time, we've replaced the old archive drop-down with a more user-friendly month-by-month calendar widget which you can use to choose posts from any week since the blog began. (You can see the calendar widget in the picture above!)</p> <p><strong>Other links to the rest of the site</strong></p> <p>If you've used the guardian.co.uk search box, you might be happy to learn that blogs are now incorporated into sitewide search results. In addition, blog author profile pages will now be merged with profile pages for the rest of the site and blogposts will appear in guardian.co.uk author feeds.</p> <p><strong>Sharing</strong></p> <p>Just as with non-blog articles, you can now email your favourite blogposts to friends, clip them to your user account, or share them via Facebook, Digg, reddit, del.icio.us, StumbleUpon, etc.</p> <p><strong>Link to the rest of the blogosphere</strong></p> <p>Have you seen the sharp new 'Most Talked About' widget on the Guardian.co.uk homepage? It catalogues which articles on guardian.co.uk are the most linked to in the blogosphere and then ranks them by popularity. This widget will live on blogs, as well, in the righthand column.</p> <p><strong>New community features!</strong></p> <p>All blog comments will now use the new Pluck module for commenting, as they do on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree\">Comment is Free</a>. Pluck allows for user avatars, archiving of previous comments, and a variety of other nifty new features. Check <a href=\"http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/inside/2008/08/blogs_and_commenting.html\">Meg Pickard's post</a> for more details. </p> <p>UPDATE: I've re-opened comments on this thread to coincide with the second batch of blogs launching today including:</p> <p>Katine<br>Art blog<br>Books blog<br>Film blog<br>Music blog<br>Theatre blog<br>TV and radio blog<br>Games blog<br>Ask Jack<br>Deadline USA<br>Greenslade<br>Media Monkey<br>Organ Grinder<br>PDA<br>Sportblog<br>Technology blog <br>Dave Hill's London blog<br>Charlotte Higgins on culture<br>Jonathan Jones on art<br>Tom Service on classical music<br>Gareth McLean on TV</p> <p>Feel free to let us know what you think!</p>",

  "<p>With 27 young people dead in 2007 and \u2013 after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/aug/18/teenage.stabbings\">the weekend's violence</a> \u2013 23 killed already this year in London alone, you can't help but wonder what is going on, on our streets. I have been inviting ex-gang members, community workers and others into parliament to discuss the gun, gang and knife crime situation in the UK. The dialogue is always intense and intriguing. One teenager, Jeremy, stood up and confronted journalists who were there. \"You have made me a victim. You labelled me and my friends a gang, now a high-profile gang want to challenge us, we were just young people hanging out.\" Elijah, a former leader of the Peel Dem crew turned his life around in prison. When I asked why, he laughed: \"I always wanted to be a businessman, never a gangster. But no one ever showed me how or gave me the opportunity.\" The PDC tattooed on his neck now has alternative meaning \u2013 Poverty Driven Children, and his new record label PDC (Public Demand Cartel) entertainments. </p> <p>I once heard Andrew, a young black man from my constituency in Brent, north London, say: \"I don't expect to live beyond 25.\" I waited for him to laugh \u2013 but he wasn't joking. But when you consider that black people are four times more likely than their white counterparts to be a victim of homicide, Andrew's view may be some young people's reality. It's an interesting fact that young people who are involved in crime grow out of it by the age of 25 (according to research by the <a href=\"http://www.bctrust.org.uk/\">Barrow Cadbury Trust</a>), and with 61.6% of young people in Brent obtaining five or more A-C grades \u2013 higher than the national average \u2013 I have a personal quest to \"keep young people alive beyond 25\". It's often overlooked, but many young people are achievers, and the media and politicians must all play our part in stopping the demonisation of youngsters. </p> <p>I believe crime will only get better if the community, and our society, gets stronger. There are still a multitude of problems in society that can beat the hope and aspiration out of the young \u2013 all the negative publicity, the labels, celebrity culture. Sometimes it seems that technology has replaced simple conversation. Today's young people need adult interaction \u2013 without this we can't prepare them for the transition from childhood to adulthood. </p> <p>I have created a website, <a href=\"http://www.mylifemysay.co.uk/\">mylifemysay.co.uk</a>, which will never close. I am also organising a week-long debate in parliament during <a href=\"http://www.londoncouncils.gov.uk/lobbying/campaigns/2010resources/localdemocracyweek.htm \">Local Democracy Week</a> (October 13-19) in the presence of ministers and other politicians, to ensure that young people's voices are listened to. I have challenged the home secretary to match public solutions to current and future government policy. I think it is time to move away from civil servants' solutions and aim for civil society solutions. We may be pleasantly surprised by the results.</p>",
  "<p><strong>11.24pm</strong> So I really wasn't going to get sucked into the whole missed drugs test debate, but I just want to point out an inaccuracy- or flippancy of language. It is not that Christine did not 'bother' to go to a drugs test. Drugs testers come and meet you where you say you will be a month before you are actually there, in a one hour time slot. As an athlete this tends to change a lot (competitions, change in training venues/schedules/studies/work/birthdays/illness/late train/traffic etc). You have to be pretty on the ball with telling them where you are. All. Of. The. Time. This is no easy task and I for one would be really bad at it. Character traits aside, Christine's missed tests were not deliberate I am sure of that. Certainly she would never 'not bother' to turn up to one. So....the website needs 400wds on Christine. Zaijian kids, thanks for bearing with me and have a great afternoon/evening wherever you are.</p> <p><strong>11.20pm</strong> Some news in on Sanya, she's blaming a tight hamstring for slowing her down in the final 80m. 'The gold would have been mine if it weren't for a hamstring grab,' she says 'I was in control for half of the race by the 320m mark, I felt my right hamstring. I pulled my leg through and it got tighter and tighter.' Jeez, I dunno what to say about this. Is she for real? Michael Johnson didn't seem to think she had any excuses. And he's a leg. For the moment I'm sticking with him.</p> <p><strong>11.14pm</strong> And there's definitely a bit of room for grovelling in here. Sorry guys for going awol...I was running up and down the stairs (6 flights no less, calves like an athlete now) trying to get a signal to bring you blogs live from the mix zone. Unfortunately with all the journos and snappers down there the signal is too weak so the view is back up in the stadium of an emptying arena, meanwhile down in the belly there Christine is doing a press conference with a huge smile on her face, no doubt. For anybody who didn't see the medal presentation ceremony, Christine could not stop smiling, a lovely broad beam, and then there were tears as the realisation of her achievement slowly dawned. This has been a very special moment in history.</p> <p><strong>11.06pm</strong> So what have we missed? A 1500m final with Andy Baddeley where the young lad lagged behind, and more Christine chat....when will it end? Maybe 2012. Or maybe that's when it will all begin again. Apparently Michael Johnson's given poor old Sanya a right rollicking for going off too fast in such an important race. Stood on the podium in poxy third place she looked pretty miserable</p> <p><strong>11.04pm</strong> Wow well that techie attempt failed spectacularly, no more wifi down there, too many crowded journos and still no sign of Christine...</p> <p><strong>10.19pm</strong> Bear with me folks, we're down in the mix zone...there are a lot of spaced out looking British journos wondering about. Personally my heart is still beating round about 100mph.</p> <p><strong>10.15pm</strong> YES YES YES! It's a Meg Ryan moment! No it's better than that! Christine has won gold! Brrrrrraps! Despite a very fast start from Sanya R she could not keep it going and as they came round the last bend Christine began to gain ground. The final 60 metres were intense but as Christine grew stronger, Sanya - incredibly, unbelievably - faded. And there she was - our face of 2012 - yes kids - crossing the line to take gold in 49.62.</p> <p><strong>10.03pm</strong> Blimey Martyn Rooney, you do like to give us all a scare don't you? After looking like second to last on the final bend, Rooney came sneaking up/down the last 100m to steal 2nd place in 44.60. Excellent show! All is forgiven re the Maurice head moves. Right in front of me now though is the women's 400m finalists checking their start blocks and strolling up and down. Christine is doing a good amount of pre-race fiddling, bit of water, sit down on the lane number block thingy, stare intently ahead. The tops are coming off now, these women mean business. Sorry but my heart is. In. My. Mouth. COME ON CHRISTINE!!!!!</p> <p><strong>9.56pm</strong> The quicker we forget about Mr Steele the better methinks (he came last). Instead let's start cranking up the hype on the women's 400m final, it's only 14 minutes away. If I was the BBC I'd be able to show you a montage of everything you wanted to know about Christine and Sanya, set to a catchy theme tune. Instead I guess we'll just carry on arguing about missed drugs test bans... Shortly before we can indulge ourselves in that fun though, Mr Martyn Rooney (no relation to Wayne I gather), is about to kick off the men's 3rd 400m semi final (yeah I know that doesn't sound right, but athletics is a little eccentric) from lane 6. Oh goodness I can't believe he just tried the Maurice Greene head shake! Did he really just do that? Martyn, no no no!</p> <p><strong>9.53pm</strong> Men's 400m semi final number 2. Andrew Steele is lining up for the Brits in lane 7, looking red faced, and mean. Well, I think that's the look he's going for. Or he might just be petrified. He has a bit of stray chest hair out the top of his retro GB vest. Not sure if it's fair to mention that?</p> <p><strong>Paul Hession</strong> finished in 5th place, 20.38, just missing out on a place in the final.</p> <p><strong>9.46pm</strong> Wowee, Jezza absolutely stormed that one, 44.15, he was ahead after just 200m. In the home straight (or strait?) he had enough time to do a Bolt and look both left and right before slowing down for the last 10m. For the fashion conscious, he was wearing his trademark silly shades, but seriously cool shiny red spikes.</p> <p><strong>9.40pm</strong> Here we go, the first semi final of the men's 400m. Defending champion Jeremy Wariner is in this one. I remember him tearing round the track that day in Athens and going 'who's he???' the only white guy in the field. Michael Johnson's protege is the only one in this heat to have run under 44 seconds this season.</p> <p><strong>9.35pm</strong> Strong flag knowledge on the blog! In other news, Marlon Devonish has just flopped in the 200m. And I say that with fondness, cos Marlon is a really top guy - and a bit nifty with the art - still we got a Brit in the mixer with Usain. Office sweepstakes on how many seconds he'll finish behind the Jamaican.....</p> <p><strong>9.30pm</strong> Malcolm's done it! Qualified in fourth place for the final with a time of 20.25. That's his first Olympic final since 2000, having missed out on Athens through illness. That's eight frickin years ago. He'll be delighted. To the nationality query person, apparently it's a two year ban you have to serve. He's got one English parent and one Jamaican parent, and despite being born in Jamaica had dual nationality. Was competing for JA as a junior but then got a knee injury which ruled him out of action for a little over a year, at which point he thought (and I'm paraphrasing) \"hey, may as well do another year and switch countries\". If I was able to go down in the mix zone I'd relay what he's telling my fellow hacks right now. Whatever it is I'm really hoping he lays on the patois. Also, thanks to the flag info, would never have known that, great pub quiz material.</p> <p><strong>9.25pm</strong> I do wish this software would load a little quicker. You've just missed Isinbayeva's tears (and pearl dangly earrings for those interested) as she was presented with her medal. Feofanova completed the Russian podium double and Silnov got a bit watery eyed just watching them, anticipating his own ceremony no doubt. Lining up in the blocks is Mr Christian Malcolm in the first of the 200m semi finals. Oh bugger he's right next to Walter Dix. This will either be an advantage or totally show him up.</p> <p><strong>9.20pm</strong> The union jacks are out in full force and our Germaine is lapping it up with a victory circuit. He must be boiling in that GB parka though. It's proper hot here tonight in the nest.</p> <p><strong>9.15pmtaketwo</strong> Pommiebarsteward there is a lot of love going out to you right now. Not to Silnov though. There was the slightest of gasps as he attempted the last height, but the bar quickly fell. He'll have to settle for...well...gold. Anyhow let's get back to rowdy partisan celebrations of Germaine's achievement. The American journo next to me just saw the scoreboard and went 'oh my gaaaad, second?' yep chaps he meant us coming second. 'That kinda scares me' he concluded.</p> <p><strong>9.15pm</strong> yes well I did say about Silnov's hair. It would be better off if it did do a Boris look - ie a few shaggy bits and spikes - but instead it is doing that terrible lay down flat bowlcut thing. Hasn't stopped him going for 2.42 though. He's got one last try.</p> <p><strong>9.05pm</strong> Crikey whatsyerface, Germaine's just won a silver medal in the high jump - our first of any kind in that event since Steve Smith's bronze in 1996 - and you wanna know who's wearing what jewellery?! Germaine's racing around like a loon and to be honest I feel like jumping out the tribune and joining him. Brrrrrap! Happy days. In sad days news, Allan Scott looks to be out of the hurdles after finishing 6th in his heat.</p> <p>BIG news in the high jump! Holm is out (need to work on those premature celebrations coach Sweden) and our Germaine is in the medals!! Question now is, what colour? NO, scrap that, it is just so brilliant that track and field (well, field) have finally got a blinkin medal, now we can all stop envying CS+S</p> <p><strong>8.55pm</strong> DJKM? I wonder what that stands for. I'm not a seasoned blogger, this is my very first live blog - yep folks, full debut - usually I read my copy three times before I file it but doin this live business you just ain't got time. It's obviously an acquired skill. Now it would be nice if you were a little patient, and also got my gender right.</p> <p><strong>8.50pm</strong> Germaine's just fouled his first jump at 2.36. He's never jumped that high before so these are nervous times. Just four left in it now. Next guy out is gonna have to say bye bye to some shrapnel. Stefan-so-good-at-it-Holm just messed up too. In the hurdles, despite a false start, USA's David Payne sailed through in 13.24 while - cue CHI-NA! roar - Dongpeng is through in third place.</p> <p><strong>8.45pm</strong> An almighty roar just gone up for Shi Dongpeng on the blocks for the 100m hurdles, Chi-NA! here goes the crowd....</p> <p>8.33pm Oh NO NO NO! Error alert....That was Mason pb-ing it up with a 2.34 (great news in itself though, you will agree). Sadly, Marty B is still stuck on trying to get over 2.32. Sorry I was far too distracted by the hurdles setting up, searching for errors of theirs while making errors of my own, I will concentrate on the high jump now and stop faffing about. Quick question...does anyone care about the men's discus? Just that it's started.</p> <p><strong>8.30pm</strong> If only David Attenborough were commentating. He's a teensy bit of a hero of mine - and all of yours I suspect - if he were to lend his expertise to this particular field, well, I predict we'd all go a little bit giddy. Whoosh. Now then back to the afletiks. Raul-Roland Spank (brilliant name, just brilliant) the German jumper has just cleared 2.32 at the last attempt. Meanwhile....men's 10m hurdles being set up on the track, let's hope they do better than our friends at Crystal Palace did the other week...NEWSFLASH! Our mate Martyn B has just cleared 2.32 on his last attempt!</p> <p>8.25pm Oh bugger I'm missing a five-minute-by-five-minute post. Here goes 8.15pm: Tom Parsons is out after a third attempt at 2.29. Damn those socks. Now back to 8.25pm, hope you're all conversant with time travel. Re crash mats, sorry folks, it's just my bad grammar at play there, he stood up off the crash mat - as in stood up - but hadn't got off yet. Hence ruled as a foul jump. Anyway doesn't matter cos he's jumped 2.32 at the first asking, as per previous post. So has Silnov now. And if anyone knows who his hairdresser is...have a word.</p> <p><strong>8.20pm</strong> Germaine's over at 2.32 on the first attempt! Woop woop! 'Whass-ma-name???' he motions to the crowd, cupping one ear. Showboating, we love it. Unfortunately, or fortunately if you're Mouthy, so is Stefan Holm. Also news just in about a 'ducking' John Terry about to be made England captain. Am I behind?</p> <p><strong>8.15pm</strong> Settle down at the back let's concentrate on the afletiks. Tom Parsons is out after a third attempt at 2.29. Damn those socks.</p> <p><strong>8.10pm</strong> Stefan Holm (Swedish) and Andrey Silnov (Russian) hot stuff indeed, and to be expected, both have seasons bests of 2.37 and 2.38 respectively. Meanwhile our boys are dabbling round the 2.30 mark. They will have to do more than wobble bars to beat those kinda stats. Some curiosities....Tom Parsons is busting Aston Villa socks for luck (oh bugger) and the dedicated high jump camera is obsessed with a lady in the crowd eating a carrot stick. Unusual. ps Predictably the Villa socks didn't work, but we have learned that British high jump coach Fayyaz Ahmed has stunning facial hair, think three amigos...</p> <p><strong>8pm</strong> Tough times for Germaine Mason. Cleared 2.29, the bar kept wobbling, and wobbling and wobbling. Germaine stood up off the crash mats (are we allowed to use that word in elite sport? Sounds so school) and the bar kept wobbling. And then....FELL OFF. How unlucky is that? Let's hope he gets back on track in his second attempt.</p> <p><strong>7.55pm</strong>ps Mouth (can I call you that?) there are a few empty seats tonight, well spotted, but not as many as at Wembley cup finals. And anyway the Chinese have been ever so good at attending the Bird's Nest thus far so I can only put their inattendance (and I think in truth that is an exaggeration, as well as a misspelled word) down to being in mourning. The whole country is practically kitted out in black armbands after Liu Xiang's hamstring incident. ps Martyn Bernard has made 2.25m on his second attempt. It's looking alright kids.</p> <p><strong>7.47pm</strong> Crikey we've got some haters on here tonight. Now listen you lot, our Christine is an absolute leg(end). Just cos she couldn't do 5th gear on the A12 and look after her little sister and phone the drugs testers all at the same time (see missed tests excuses for details) doesn't make her a wrong'un. She had quite enough hate from the tabloids and we don't need to continue that. Northendboy (Preston are you?) Christine's media adoration? I am not following you. This is the same lady that was savaged at every end of the press, TV and radio spectrum. And then received 0.71% of the Sports Personality whatsit of Year vote. I'd hardly call her popular. On more positive pastures....Tom Parsons and Germaine Mason have made it over 2.25m.</p> <p><strong>7.30pm</strong> Yes MouthoftheMersey it does. Now look, we haven't time for self flagellation or confessions, we're behind schedule and there are updates to get on with. Pardon any typos, we may be skitting over the keyboard quite fast. So far Alyson Felix has breezed through her 200m heat in second place, luckily our Emily Freeman has also got through (phewee), plus Roqaya Al-Gassra blazing into first place in her heat - which suggests that hijabs are no impediment to sporting excellence. Blimey we're getting a bit controversial and it's only 12.32pm your time. What else? Brit blokes going strong in the high jump, we have three of them, surely we can convert that into a medal?</p> <p><strong>Oooh</strong> dear, what a way to start an athletics session, just a little bit late. Imagine if Usain Bolt had tried that, then he'd definitely have been accused of showboating. Luckily I won't get accused of showboating because I haven't ever won anything, and am unlikely to do so in the near future. Let's hope that isn't a Cassandra moment vis a vis the British athletics team here tonight. As all British athletics fans are already sorely aware of, while the medals have 'rained in' (oh god that phrase) in cycling, rowing and sailing, so far in athletics we have won precisely zilch medals in four days. It is thoroughly depressing, and, dare I suggest, thoroughly disruptive to the democracy of sport. Who ever did cycling, sailing or rowing at school? (Erm, those whose parents paid their school fees needn't join in this show of hands). Anyway all that waffle was simply a preamble to say...hold onto your hats girls and boys, this might just be our night! Woop woop! Or brrrap brrrrap if you're supporting the East London contingent. Christine Ohuruogu in the 400m final is the big one of course and we are hoping she is going to whup Sanya Richards' smiley little arse. Then we can happily make her the face of 2012, and no more whingeing. Elsewhere excitement includes the men's high jump final, in which we have three - yes really! - Brits competing....watch this space</p>",
  "<p>Russia and Georgia today exchanged 20 prisoners of war, but there was still no sign of a Russian withdrawal from Georgia that was supposed to have begun yesterday.</p> <p>The prisoner exchange began as two Russian military helicopters landed in the village of Igoeti, the closest that Russian forces have advanced to the Georgian capital of Tbilisi. Soldiers and men in unmarked clothing disembarked and two people on stretchers were taken to Georgian officials. Georgian ambulances later brought two other people to the helicopters. One was on a stretcher.</p> <p>Alexander Lomaia, the head of Georgia's security council, told reporters in Igoeti that 15 Georgians and five Russians were exchanged. </p> <p>\"It went smoothly,\" he said. The operation also witnessed by Russian Major General Vyacheslav Borisov, who commands troops in the area.</p> <p>Russia's most forward position last night was where it had been for the past few days, at Igoeti, 27 west of Tiblisi. Russian tanks were visible today in the surrounding wooded hills. An armoured vehicle also ploughed into a line of stationary Georgian police cars.</p> <p>Lomaia said the exchange removed any pretext for Russians to stay in Igoeti or anywhere on Georgia's only significant east-west highway. Russia announced yesterday it had begun to pull back forces after an EU-brokered ceasefire agreement, but as of this morning there was no sign of significant movement in Igoeti or in the nearby strategic city of Gori.</p> <p>The Russians appeared determined to interpret the ceasefire and promised withdrawal as they see fit. One Russian defence official indicated that a withdrawal from Georgia proper is not imminent.</p> <p>\"Rear units, as well as second- and third-echelon units are being pulled back first. The vanguard units will be pulled back at the final stage,\" Colonel Igor Konashenkov, a spokesman for Russia's land forces, was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency.</p> <p>Despite claims by Moscow that a pullout had begun, Russian forces yesterday could be seen across most of the country, and Georgian officials claimed that armoured columns had tried to push further into the mountainous heartland, towards Borjomi in the south and Sachkhere in the west.</p> <p>\"We could leave here in two minutes. But we've had no orders to pull out,\" said a Russian soldier manning a checkpoint yesterday about 25 miles west of the capital, Tbilisi. He knew nothing about a ceasefire.</p> <p>Georgia's foreign minister, Eka Tkeshelashvili, said Russian troops had razed a Georgian military base at the western city of Senaki.</p> <p>\"Practically speaking there are so far no signs of withdrawal at all. What they're trying to do is to widen their territorial presence,\" Tkeshelashvili said before flying to Brussels to appeal for support from Nato foreign ministers today. \"They have pretty much unrestricted freedom of action. They are trying to show us they are masters on the ground right now.\"</p> <p>She said she would call for punitive diplomatic measures against Russia, excluding Moscow from international institutions, if Moscow refused to comply.</p> <p>A Georgian interior ministry spokesman said columns of Russian armoured vehicles were stopped by police roadblocks outside Borjomi and Sachkhere and agreed to turn back. But another column broke through a similar roadblock west of Tbilisi.</p> <p>One report circulated yesterday evening suggested the Russian forces would only begin their promised withdrawal after nightfall, and Georgian officials said they would review the situation in the morning after further international pressure.</p> <p>\"I might be naive, but I'm still hopeful that a very strong, common effort by Europe and the United States will be effective in the withdrawing of Russian troops from territory of Georgia,\" Tkeshelashvili said. \"We'll see how well grounded my expectation is.\"</p> <p>The Russian president, Dmitry Medvedev, vowed to initiate a troop withdrawal yesterday after signing the agreement on Saturday. On Sunday he told France's president Nicholas Sarkozy a pullout was imminent.</p> <p>Last night Russian officers insisted that the withdrawal had already begun. In Moscow the deputy chief of staff, Anatoly Nogovitsyn, said: \"According to the peace plan, the withdrawal of Russian peacekeepers and reinforcements has begun.\" This included Gori, he added.</p> <p>Russian officials across the border in North Ossetia echoed this. \"War columns are already leaving. The main pullout will take place today. It takes a long time to pack up a tank,\" a Russian spokesman in the North Ossetia capital, Vladikavkaz, said. \"We are talking days not weeks.\"</p> <p>Another Russian military spokesman, Lieutenant General Nikolay Uvarov, told the BBC last night that Russian forces had left Gori, which lies on the main east-west highway running through the heart of the country. </p> <p>However, Russian troops were very much in evidence in the town, and at checkpoints between Tbilisi and Gori, searching cars and cutting the road between east and west Georgia. Nor was there a sign of military movement from Gori towards South Ossetia.</p> <p>Georgian officials also claimed the Russians were busy laying mines. Tkeshelashvili said that one of her principal appeals to Nato today will be for help in demining.</p> <p>\"Russian forces are not leaving. They are merely rotating their hardware. One comes, another one goes,\" said Irakly Porchkhidze, a Georgian government official inside Gori, where humanitarian relief was arriving today. He added: \"There is no pullout.\"</p> <p>There was growing concern that the Kremlin plans to exploit ambiguities in the Sarkozy-drafted agreement to justify a semi-permanent presence inside Georgia's borders. Moscow today indicated it intended to deploy its forces under an internationally brokered peace agreement in 1999, allowing Russia a generous \"security zone\". </p> <p>The zone extends nine miles around Tskhinvali and allows a \"corridor\" into Georgian areas. The document was designed to end the Georgian-Ossetian conflict and agreed by a joint control commission, an international body. The Georgian foreign minister, Tkeshelashvili, said the 1999 deal only allowed Russia a maximum of 500 peacekeepers, not to garrison towns or set up checkpoints.</p> <p>South Ossetian militias yesterday said they had no intention of handing back territory. On Saturday the militias, supported by Russian heavy armour, seized Akhalgori, 25 miles north-west of Tbilisi. \"This is now ours. It's Ossetian land,\" a militia spokesman said yesterday morning.</p> <p>The town was under the control of South Ossetia's interior ministry and police administration, he said. The Georgian flag had been replaced by a white, red and yellow Ossetian one.</p>",
  "<p>Living dolls ... Photograph: Greg Campbell/AP</p> <p>Elvis wanted to be your teddy bear, but instead he's become a Barbie doll. In the lead-up to the 31st anniversary of his death last Saturday, <a href=\"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2008/aug/14/elvis-priscilla-in-barbie-world/\">toy company Mattel has recreated him on his wedding day with Priscilla</a>, his bride of less than five years.</p> <p>The dolls cost $65, but an autographed boxed set was auctioned off for $6,800 to one lucky fan at a fundraiser for <a href=\"http://www.elvis.com/presleyplace/\">Presley Place, an apartment building in Memphis that houses homeless families</a>. \"I don't know if I saw it well, but I think it's a good likeness,\" said the winning bidder.</p> <p>This is not the first time <a href=\"http://www.billbam.com/barlovelgif9.html\">Elvis has been made into a toy</a>. He spent most of his short life being somebody's plaything. His mother, Colonel Tom Parker, and his ever-reliable drugs supplier Dr Nick - they all pulled his strings.</p> <p>This might not have been a wholly a bad thing: it was because of his sucker-attachment to <a href=\"http://www.elvispresleynews.com/Elvis-GladysPresley.html\">his mother</a> that he first set foot in Memphis' Sun Studio and paid $4 to record some loving ballads as a <a href=\"http://oldies.about.com/od/elvis/a/elvis1954.htm\">birthday present</a> for her.</p> <p>Left to his own devices, Elvis was a train-wreck waiting to happen. Before he fell into the colonel's clutches, Elvis was out of control. The <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5OZ9tOvhg0\">false-start to Milk Cow Blues</a> may have been contrived, but he sounds like he means it: \"Let's get real, real gone for a change!\"</p> <p>He couldn't help but be trouble: \"I don't take no orders from no kind of man,\" he reckoned, some 10 years before the Colonel upped his own earnings share from 25 to 50%, apparently with Elvis's agreement. \"My pelvis has nothing to do with what I do,\" he indignantly told one interviewer, after accidentally sexing up most of the world. \"I get a kind of rhythm with the music ... I'm not trying to look vulgar and nasty.\" A few years later, Elvis personally choreographed the homoerotic sequence for the <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6595912/jailhouse_rock\">very gay Jailhouse Rock</a>.</p> <p>In Mick Farren and Edward Barker's seminal 1975 book Watch Out Kids, it was noted: \"Elvis had soul and this was [a] revolution ... He was condemned in the press, on the radio, and from pulpits ... He became a symbol of anti-authority and anti-parents ... until by the time he was drafted he had become a symbol of the ideal all-American boy.\"</p> <p>Despite his apparently unconscious pelvis gyrations eventually leading to the summer of love, Sgt Presley received a good conduct medal and by 1970, <a href=\"http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/nixonelvis.htm\">a drug-addled Elvis flew to the White House</a> to offer his anti-drug vigilante services to Nixon. About four years later, he developed a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmLIBL4xgJ0&amp;feature=related\">similar attitude toward degenerates as Travis Bickle</a>.</p> <p>While threatening to pull any gossip's \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmLIBL4xgJ0&amp;feature=related\">goddamn tongue out by the roots</a>\" for speculating about his drug use, Elvis was taking enough downers to sink a submarine and uppers to launch a space shuttle. A couple of months before his death, his whistle-blowing sacked minders beseeched: \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkWds8YuCAU\">How do you protect a man from himself?</a>\"</p> <p>The god-fearing, American ideal of Elvis, as epitomised in the new Barbie doll, can never negate the wild, savage rebel icon. Both co-exist and the weird paradox of kitsch commodity and anti-authoritarian punk has encompassed his entire pop-cultural image ever since. Whether he was being led by conservative capitalist forces or playing the devil's tune, Elvis remains a crashing, burning law unto himself.</p>",
  "<p>Record numbers of people have accepted university places through Clearing this year, according to official statistics.</p> <p>Despite the race for a university place slowing, 1,355 more people have accepted places since Friday.</p> <p>According to the <a href=\"http://www.ucas.com/website/news/media_releases/2008/app_stats08/appsta180808.html\">latest figures</a> from Ucas, published yesterday, 4,767 students have gained places through the Clearing system \u2013 up from 3,392 on Friday and 4,448 this time last year.</p> <p>In total, 361,760 students have now accepted places at university, which compares with 333,174 the same time last year.</p> <p>This means roughly the same percentage of total candidates have accepted places through the clearing system at this stage compared with last year \u2013 1.32% compared with 1.34% in 2007.</p> <p>However, a sizeable number \u2013 68,561 \u2013 are waiting for a decision from their chosen institution or are still deciding where to go, compared with 60,091 four days after results were given out in 2007.</p> <p>Ucas is due to publish tomorrow a breakdown of what subjects students are applying to study at university.</p> <p>But researchers at the School of Oriental and African Studies suggest that university languages are in decline.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.routesintolanguages.ac.uk/community\">research</a>, led by Soas' Joanna McPake and Itesh Sachdev, found the numbers taking languages at university fell rapidly in the last decade.</p> <p>The report on community languages such as Urdu showed that English universities provide courses in 81 languages but mostly for foreign language learners.</p> <p>The researchers argue for more degree courses in the UK's most widely used community languages - Urdu, Cantonese, Punjabi and Bengali.</p> <p>\"We propose a broader vision of language learning which encompasses the interests of community and foreign language learners, breaking down artificial distinctions between the two areas and benefiting all learners, whatever their background and whatever their goals.</p> <p>\"Our recommendations specifically concern improving provision for community language learning in higher education, but should also contribute to the development and embedding of this wider vision,' the researchers said.</p> <p>They urged a series of \"awareness raising activities\" among universities, policy-makers, politicians and linguistic communities.</p>",

They could mean long-serving staff would receive many thousands of pounds less if they were laid off.</p> <p>M&amp;S refused to comment on the concern that it could be planning a cull at a time when the slowing economy is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/14/unemploymentdata.economicgrowth\">pushing up unemployment</a>.</p> <p>\"This is about bringing us into line with what the market is doing,\" said an M&amp;S spokeswoman, adding that the company would still offer better terms than its rivals, and double the statutary minimum.</p> <p>But Paul Kenny, general secretary of the GMB, fears the proposed changes are the prelude to some significant layoffs.</p> <p>\"Companies don't cut redundancy payouts in advance unless they are planning some pretty swingeing cuts,\" warned Kenny.</p> <p>Kenny also accused M&amp;S of taking a \"cavalier\" attitude to its workforce in recent years, which he claimed was encouraging more staff to join unions such as the GMB.</p> <p>Currently, a worker aged more than 40 is entitled to 3.75 weeks pay for every year spent at M&amp;S, but the company is now proposing cutting this to 3 weeks. Younger employees would see their payout cut from 2.5 weeks to 2 weeks for every year's service. Under the proposals, the maximum payout would also be cut from 70 weeks to 52.</p> <p>M&amp;S insists that it is open to feedback from its employee representatives \u2013 the 3,500 staff who represent the 60,000-strong workforce in negotiations with management.</p> <p>But according to the Times, these representatives have already warned that the proposals have <a href=\"http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/retailing/article4561341.ece\">alarmed and upset the retailer's staff</a>.</p> <p>Nick Bubb, analyst at Pali International, believes that M&amp;S suffered poor sales in July and may be under pressure to cut costs.</p> <p>\"With sales falling and costs rising, M&amp;S have to do something to try to protect profits, so it would come as no surprise if more cutbacks are coming at HQ and if M&amp;S scale back store openings more aggressively,\" said Bubb in a research note today.</p> <p>Some staff are understood to be particularly unhappy that their redundancy terms are being cut just weeks after Steven Esom, M&amp;S's former head of food, walked away with \u00a3500,000 after being sacked after just one year at the company.</p> <p>\"Why do people at the bottom, who have no control how the business is run, get the sack on the cheap while the top bosses get large payouts no matter how badly they have screwed up?\" asked Kenny.</p> <p>Last month chief executive Stuart Rose defended the payout to Esom saying that it was important to honour contractual obligations. <br></p>",
  "<p>Ten French soldiers have been killed and 21 wounded following a Taliban ambush 40 miles east of Kabul. According to Afghan officials, four of them were executed after being captured or \"kidnapped\" during a two-day running battle with more than 100 insurgents. </p> <p>The casualties were mainly from the 8th Parachute Regiment, recently arrived in the country as part of a controversial reinforcement of the French presence in Afghanistan ordered by Nicolas Sarkozy earlier this year. The French president is due to arrive in Afghanistan tomorrow morning to show troops that \"France was by their sides\".</p> <p>Elsewhere in the country, in one of the most audacious attacks since the Taliban relaunched their insurgency two years ago, a team of suicide bombers attempted to storm American and Afghan National Army (ANA) bases near the eastern city of Khost, the second major assault on the position in less than 24 hours. </p> <p>In the past three days, more than 100 people have died in fighting and bomb attacks around the country. \"We had an okay winter and a good spring but we are having a tough summer,\" said an official from Nato's International Security Assistance Force. </p> <p>The French casualties appear to have come after a joint Isaf and ANA patrol was ambushed yesterday afternoon in the Spir Kundi district of Kabul province, 20 miles north-east of the town of Sorobi, a strategic bottleneck on the crucial road linking the capital to the city of Jalalabad near the Pakistani border. </p> <p>The deaths are likely to cause uproar in France. Sarkozy has taken French foreign policy in a radically more pro-American direction than his predecessor, Jacques Chirac, and has stressed France's commitment to the military and reconstruction effort in Afghanistan. Since 2002 the French have contributed a 1,000 men to the Isaf force patrolling Kabul but the new troops were the first to be committed to combat operations. </p> <p>The French deployment was originally planned for the south of Afghanistan where fighting has been fiercest. Before this latest incident, 14 French soldiers had been killed since their initial deployment. Overall 176 foreign soldiers have died this year.</p> <p>A Taliban spokesman claimed today that the insurgents had inflicted \"heavy losses\" on Nato troops. \"This morning we ambushed Nato troops in Sorobi district using mines and rockets. We destroyed five vehicles,\" Zabihullah Mujahed told the AFP news agency. </p> <p>Taliban spokesman routinely exaggerate numbers or fabricate claims of civilian casualties, but the loss of the French troops will hand a major propaganda victory to the insurgents. The lightly armed Taliban have often suffered heavy casualties whenever they have risked a formal engagement with western troops, preferring to avoid direct confrontation. </p> <p>Fighting continued overnight and into this morning though local officials said that the clash was over by early afternoon. Afghan officials said that three ANA had been injured and dozens of Taliban militants killed. </p> <p>\"Recently Isaf and ANA deployed into area and started going on patrol. This was their third patrol and it came under attack yesterday afternoon and it lasted several hours. There were [coalition] air bombardments but it is an uninhabited area so we have no reports of civilian casualties,\" Qazi Suleiman, the district chief, told the Guardian. </p> <p>Abdul Wahed, provincial councillor from Sorobi, said the fighting today lasted three or four hours.</p> <p>The propaganda value of the battle will be enhanced by its proximity to the capital. The engagement is the first major clash to take place within Kabul province itself. Last week an attack on aid workers in Logar province and strikes on convoys in Wardak province to the south of the capital revealed the growing presence the fragmented alliance of groups that comprise the Taliban have been able to established in areas previously considered under government control. </p> <p>Kabul has seen a huge security operation in recent days aimed at preventing an attack on the Afghanistan's Independence Day on Monday. </p> <p>However the problem merely seems to have been displaced. The rugged plateaux and valleys to the north and east of Kabul has become increasingly problematic in recent months with growing numbers of attacks on convoys on the road to Jalalabad. In one incident last week near Sorobi, insurgents stopped traffic on the road and torched coalition fuel tankers. </p> <p>Accounts of the incident at the US and ANA military bases near Khost differ. However, Arsala Jamal, the governor of Khost province, said that 10 suicide bombers had been killed along with one ANA soldier. Jamal described a complex and ambitious operation involving two waves of attacks late on Monday night and again yesterday morning, with teams of suicide bombers backed by conventional fighters. \"Militarily this was very stupid,\" he said. \"The Taliban wanted to show off to the world with a spectacular strike.\" </p> <p>Isaf officials insist that the campaign against the insurgents cannot be won purely by military means. Brigadier-General Richard Blanchette, Isaf spokesperson said the French casualties \"would not deter Isaf from supporting the people of Afghanistan in their fight against the enemies of peace and stability\".</p>",
  "<p>Judging by the response to her Comment is free piece last week, I'm obviously not the only one who was stunned <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/14/religion.anglicanism\">by Julie Burchill's</a> assertion that in her latest incarnation as a \"Christian Zionist, a Christian feminist, and a Christian socialist,\" she now believes \"literally, in the God of the Old Testament\". As dozens of posters pointed out, the term \"Christian feminist\" is an oxymoron; it's a glaring contradiction in terms on a par with \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compassionate_conservatism\">compassionate conservative</a>\" and \"pro-life anti-abortionist\".</p> <p>Christianity is and always has been antithetical to women's freedom and equality, but it's certainly not alone in this. Whether it's one of the world's major faiths or <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article4164416.ece\">an off-the-wall cult</a>, religion means one thing and one thing only for those women unfortunate enough to get caught up in it: oppression. It's the patriarchy made manifest, male-dominated, set up by men to protect and perpetuate their power.</p> <p>Since men first conceived of the notion of a single omnipotent creator, that divine being has taken the form of a man: no matter what name he answers to, be it Yahweh, Jehovah, Allah, or just plain God, what's not in doubt is that he's a he. His teachings and his various holy books reinforce the message that this life exists for men, while the best women can hope for is some kind of reward in the next one; as long as we do as we're told of course, without questioning our lords and masters, and as long as we manage to remain pure of heart and mind while we prostrate ourselves at their feet.</p> <p>Like a lot of people, I've dabbled with various religions over the years, but each time it was my feminism that proved my downfall: from the Rastafarian ex-boyfriend who refused to let me touch any living thing during that time of the month when I was allegedly \"unclean\", to the happy-clappy church that took my purchase of a non-gender-specific Bible as evidence that I had a heritage of witchcraft in my family, and that reassured me I would one day be reunited with the foetus I'd had aborted (now there's an encounter to look forward to!) Whatever it was I was looking for when I crossed these hallowed thresholds, I came away with no more than a growing comprehension that it was all a con: Jesus doesn't want me for a sunbeam; indeed, there's no room even in the stable for women like me.</p> <p>From the very first days of feminism there's been a recognition that religious doctrine is incompatible with the quest for women's rights. As <a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0205/p17s01-bogn.html\">Susan B Anthony</a> said way back in the 19th century: \"The worst enemy women have is in the pulpit.\" Or as Helen H Gardener put it in 1885 in <a href=\"http://www.infidels.org/library/historical/helen_gardener/men_women_and_gods.html\">Men, Women, and Gods</a>: </p> <blockquote> <p>This religion and the Bible require of woman everything, and give her nothing. They ask her support and her love, and repay her with contempt and oppression \u2026 Every injustice that has ever been fastened upon women in a Christian country has been 'authorised by the Bible' and riveted and perpetuated by the pulpit.</p> </blockquote> <p>And so it goes on today. In any society where religion dominates it is women who pay the price: we can argue until we're blue in the face about whether or not any particular religion sanctions so-called honour crimes for example, but what's unarguable is that men's interpretation of religion, and the patriarchal values that religion instils, has led to <a href=\"http://www.stophonourkillings.com/\">the murders</a> of countless women. Similarly, it's in the name of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/07/religion.women\">religion that girls</a> are denied an education; in the name of religion that more than half a million women die every year because they cannot <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/aug/21/valuingwomenslives\">access safe abortions</a>; in the name of <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/public-health-and-religion-aids-america-abstinence-480593.html\">religion that Aids</a> continues its unrelenting progress across Africa, and in the name of religion that women throughout the world remain subjugated, impoverished and denied individual agency. </p> <p>It's in the name of social cohesion that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/feb/08/uk.religion\">Archbishop of Canterbury</a> now expects us to quietly accept the inevitability of Sharia law in this country: one rule for us and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/feb/14/failedbyreligiouslaw\">another for our Muslim sisters</a>. Well I'm sorry archbishop but no, there should be no ifs or buts on this one; we're either equal under the law or we're not. We should be no more prepared to sell out Muslim women in the name of religious tolerance than we are Christian women, and the last time I looked, despite its very best efforts, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jan/10/religiousrightdefeated1\">religious right</a> weren't deciding the law around here either.</p> <p>Don't get me wrong, I'm not preaching intolerance or condemning those women who do choose to follow a faith. We probably all need something to help us get by in this life: I've chosen nicotine as my particular <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opium_of_the_people\">opiate</a>, but whatever floats your boat. Wear the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/jul/28/fashion.women\">hijab</a> with pride if that's what does it for you, or wear your <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Ring_Thing\">silver-ring-thing</a> and pledge <a href=\"http://jezebel.com/5009722/purity-balls-ruining-young-girls-one-white-rose-at-a-time\">an oath of chastity</a> to your dad. Just don't try and claim that any of those things are symbols of freedom and emancipation; they're not.</p> <p>If Burchill is happy being one of God's handmaidens, then good luck to her; I sincerely hope she finds whatever it is she's looking for in her quest for enlightenment. But let's not pretend that this newfound role is in any way compatible with being a feminist or an advocate for women's rights. As the lion is never going to lie down with the lamb, so the church is never going to passively cede any control to women: it's simply not in their interest.</p>",
  "<p>Microsoft's Engineering Windows 7 has a long post by Steve Sinofsky on the background to <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/e7/archive/2008/08/18/windows_5F00_7_5F00_team.aspx\">Windows' development</a>. He lists the various groups that contribute to the project -- from Applets and Gadgets to Windows App Platform -- and says:</p> <blockquote> we create feature teams with n developers, n testers, and 1/2n program managers. This ratio is pretty constant across the team. On average a feature team is about 40 developers across the Windows 7 project. </blockquote> <br> <p>So, 40 developers times 23 groups comes to 920 people, so the total is probably around a thousand. Assuming they cost Microsoft $100,000 per year each, that comes to $100 million a year.</p> <p>It sounds like a big team, but maybe not so big if you break it down. If there are 40 people working on something like IE8 or Media Center, that means there are (following Sinofsky's formula) only 16 actual programmers on each team.</p> <p>Is that too many, or too few?</p> <p>IBM had over a thousand people working on OS/2, and at the time, most people reckoned that was bloated*.....</p> <p>* Note: this was meant to indicate a bloated team. The code wasn't all that bloated....</p>",
  "<p> Good-looking, bad-looking ... John Berger and Sebastian Barry's Booker contenders</p> <p>Following the recent announcement of the Booker longlist, I'm pleased to say that The Booker Club is up and running again. My first read will be Aravind Adiga and I'll do my best to maintain alphabetical order and a steady rate of just over a book a week from then on. I hope you'll join me.</p> <p>Already the idea of reading the entire Booker dozen before the September 9 shortlist announcement is looking rather optimistic, while I'm not sure I'll have even got through them by the final announcement on October 9. No matter, the books look interesting and I'm game for the challenge. Going on what happened last year, when many of <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/books/2007/09/sam_jordison_venerable_prizes.html \">the books I liked best</a> didn't make the shortlist last time, I'm also happy to overrun in the hope of catching some missed gems.</p> <p>I'm also pleased to report that, <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/books/2007/08/judging_the_booker_by_its_cove.html\">just like last year</a>, I don't know much about most of the books on this year's long list at this early stage. Although that's partly thanks to my ignorance, it's also a good sign that - whatever you think about literary prizes - the Booker is at least doing a good job of promoting some previously unsung talent.</p> <p>It also presents me the opportunity to judge the books on offer almost entirely on the basis of their covers. I've got no preconceptions, no background knowledge and in several cases no books (since they aren't yet published). So it is that I can here present a very literally superficial, surface only view of the long list:</p> <p><strong>Aravind Adiga - The White Tiger</strong> This comes with a recommendation from Mohsin Hamid, who has selected the adjectives \"compelling, angry and darkly humorous\" from the big pot of book review clich\u00e9s that I'll no doubt have dipped into repeatedly myself by the time this job is through. Considering what a cynical study in issue-fiction his own Booker-nominated <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/books/2007/09/booker_club_the_reluctant_fund.html \">The Reluctant Fundamentalist</a> was, this blurb makes me wary. In the book's favour is the fact that physically it's a lovely item. Nice paper, simple but eye-catching cover design and fine ruby red flyleaves. I'm looking forward to reading it already.</p> <p><strong>Gaynor Arnold - Girl in a Blue Dress</strong> Another Booker success for the admirable Birmingham-based Tindall Street Press that comes complete with a fine battling underdog story about how the book took five years to write, was turned down by mainstream publishers and agents and generally seemed to be going nowhere until the Brummie talent spotters got it nominated for the biggest prize in the country ... I'm already biased in its favour.</p> <p><strong>Sebastian Barry - The Secret Scripture</strong> The Booker site promises <a href=\"http://www.themanbookerprize.com/prize/books/360\">Ireland, blight, mistreatment</a>. Haven't we had that before? Endlessly?</p> <p><strong>John Berger - From A to X</strong> This is the book I'd most like to win. Partly because Berger is a talented writer, partly because I enjoyed <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/books/2008/01/looking_back_at_the_booker_joh.html\">his other prize-winner G</a>, but mainly to see what he will do when confronted with the chairman of the judges, Michael Portillo. Considering the fact that last time he won he gave all his prize money to the Black Panthers, this meeting with the former Tory hate figure could be most interesting ...</p> <p><strong>Michelle de Kretser - The Lost Dog</strong> \"A fine novel\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jun/14/saturdayreviewsfeatres.guardianreview5,\">according to Ursula K Le Guin</a> which means it's almost certainly worth taking seriously. Although <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/04/books/review/McCulloch-t.html\">this effective skewering</a> in the New York Times does make me nervous. \"The past is not what is over but what we wish to have done with.\" Eh?</p> <p><strong>Amitav Ghosh - Sea of Poppies</strong> Opium! Pirates! And, er, colonial confusion and guilt ... It is the Booker prize after all.</p> <p><strong>Linda Grant - The Clothes on Their Backs</strong> The idea of a novel about clothes makes my normally quiescent inner-male chauvinist shudder in dismay. Let's hope he's proved wrong.</p> <p><strong>Mohammed Hanif - A Case of Exploding Mangoes</strong> A debut novel that apparently plays around with the endless conspiracy theories surrounding <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Zia\">the mysterious death of Pakistani leader Muhammad Zia Ul-Haq</a>. Sounds promising.</p> <p><strong>Philip Hensher - The Northern Clemency</strong> An epic about Thatcher's Britain. It will be intriguing to find out what chairman Portillo makes of this one. <strong>Joseph O'Neill - Netherland</strong> This is being touted as one of the greatest cricket books written, not to mention one of the finest post 9/11 American novels. Both unusual, but admirable, achievements for an Irishman. Going on the cover alone, this is the book I'm most looking forward to reading.</p> <p><strong>Salman Rushdie - The Enchantress of Florence</strong> In recent years, as well as hanging around with ageing rock stars, the once brilliant Rushdie has also been increasingly reviewed like one. We are told each new book he puts out is a \"return to form\", just like the last few Rolling Stones, REM, and David Bowie albums weren't either. But then, even if this is half as good as Midnight's Children, I'll probably enjoy reading it. Apparently John Sutherland will curry his proof copy of this book and eat it if it doesn't win. If that happens, I hope he posts the video footage on this site.</p> <p><strong>Tom Rob Smith - Child 44</strong> <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/books/2008/07/in_from_the_cold_the_novel_tha.html\">Already creating something of stir</a> as - supposedly - the first thriller to appear on a Booker longlist (even if The Reluctant Fundamentalist's cover advertised that as a thriller too). It will be interesting to see how genre snobbery affects this one's chances. Meanwhile: Stalin! A serial killer! The MGB! Sounds fun.</p> <p><strong>Steve Toltz - A Fraction of the Whole</strong> \"From the Australian bush to the caf\u00e9s of Paris; from the highs of first love to the lows of failed ambition, this is an unforgettable, rollicking and deeply moving family story.\" I love the word \"rollicking\" but can pass no other comment about this book, other than that I'm not sure what the pink spots on the cover are about.</p>",
  "<p>Ideas for where to go for the summer can come from anywhere; the National Gallery is as good a place as any. Claude Monet's <a href=\"http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/work?workNumber=ng3951\">The Beach At Trouville</a> was painted at the once hyper-fashionable Normandy resort, and grains of sand are famously mixed into the paint, testifying \u2014 along with the picture's boldness and immediacy \u2014 to the fact that Monet painted it en situation while in Trouville on his honeymoon.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336738692\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2008/08/18/trouvillemonet.jpg\" alt=\"Boardwalk at Trouville by Claude Monet\" width=\"220\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The boardwalk at Trouville by Claude Monet. Christie Images/Corbis</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Corbis</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1870, Trouville was the last word in smart; it has long been overtaken in chic by the glitzier, ritzier Deauville just next door, where there is a sleek film festival, and oodles of designer stores policed by tanned men and women who look as if they will step outside their premises and ask to see your credit card if you wish to keep on window-shopping for any length of time.</p> <p>The gentleness and understated charm of Trouville-sur-Mer certainly seemed nicer to me. The town is often described as Nice to Deauville's Cannes. It is perhaps Torquay to Deauville's Brighton, or maybe Kate Middleton to Deauville's Kate Moss. The famous beach itself was evidently painted by Monet facing west, towards the casino \u2014 which, like so many such places of illicit pleasure on the French coasts, is not a sleazy little underground club but a grand, separate building.</p> <p>Sadly, Monet's prospect has been marred by an ugly-looking property development. But the beach really is a wonderful expanse, a great sandy reach which extends miles uninterruptedly up the coast in the other direction, sometimes sparsely populated or even dreamily empty even on the sunniest days. In many ways, it is like an old-fashioned bucket-and-spade English seaside town, and in the 19th century it was credited with having imported to France the English fad for \"sea-bathing\". There are pony rides on the sand and at high summer actual donkey races, the courses des \u00e2nes.</p> <p>The beach has other claims to fame, incidentally. It is where the young Gustave Flaubert fell in love in 1836, walking behind a beautiful married woman, Elisa Schlesinger, and gallantly picking up her cape which had fallen on to the sand. Marcel Proust stayed in one of the villas overlooking the beach, making it the model for La Raspeli\u00e8re in Remembrance Of Things Past, and stayed also in the Hotel Des Roches Noires, whose breezy glamour Monet also painted. That is now an apartment block of faded, muted grandeur.</p> <p>Swimming in Trouville for me meant a long, purposeful march out into the surf even when the tide was in; a geographical peculiarity in the form of a long trough parallel to the shoreline means that the water gets deep and then suddenly, disconcertingly, shallow again, quite far out. It is probably dangerous, which is why a coast guard actually stands watchfully in the water with his trousers rolled up to his knees, arms folded, a walkie-talkie at the ready. When we retreated from a swim one afternoon, my three-year-old son discovered the dead body of a shark, three feet in length, in the sand. (What happens is that they get caught by fishing boats and then thrown back, to be washed up later.) There was a great temptation to grab the shark, carry it up to my wife \u2014 sunbathing and generally chillaxing \u2014 and treat her to a playful jape. But touching a shark carries a powerful taboo, especially if you are afraid that some final beyond-the-grave muscle reflex will make it snap its jaws round your hand one last time. It was left well alone.</p> <p>We had come to Trouville without pain and without fuss via Eurostar to Paris Nord and then by train from St Lazare out to the station of Trouville-Deauville where a salty haze in the air seems to finely granulate the light. A house high on the hilltop overlooking the coastline was where we stayed \u2014 sharing with my sister-in-law, her husband and their two children \u2014 and where there is a remarkable line of villas all with this same tremendous prospect: we took a boat ride out to sea a little way precisely to appreciate this remarkable stretch of property. (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marguerite_Duras\">Marguerite Duras</a> called it the greatest \"tracking shot\" in France.)</p> <p>One of the great things to do in Trouville is make a morning visit to the fish market, whose stalls extend the length of the port behind the Casino, and will stay open as long as that morning's catch remains unsold. Short of actually scrambling aboard the fishing boat as it comes into harbour and haggling with the captain there and then, this is the best way to get fresh fish. The <a href=\"http://www.holidayfrancephotos.com/category/search-results/detail/735?searchstring=normandy\">fish auction house</a>, a modest, pavilion-like structure designed in the 1930s is now a listed building.</p> <p>While I snoozed in a hammock in the garden of our rented villa one afternoon, my wife and niece nonetheless took an urgent stroll to Deauville for some shopping \u2014 an area in which Trouville is obviously outclassed.

  "<p>Three people were still in critical condition today after yesterday's fatal coach crash near Alton Towers, which left a Polish fruit picker dead.</p> <p>The vehicle, carrying more than 70 passengers on a day trip to the theme park, plunged down a steep embankment.</p> <p>The man, a 26-year-old, was pronounced dead at the scene of the crash in Alton, Staffordshire.</p> <p>Twenty-one people were taken to local hospitals in Stoke-on-Trent, Stafford, Burton and Selly Oak, Birmingham, and dozens more sustained minor injuries.</p> <p>Two of the injured were airlifted to hospital and paramedics treated \"walking wounded\" at the medical centre at Alton Towers.</p> <p>The coach's driver is among those in a critical condition, with serious leg injuries, police said. He was given a routine breath test following the crash, which was negative. The passengers, from Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and South Africa, had been on a day trip to the theme park.</p> <p>They were all workers on the family-run fruit business Lutton Farm, based in Lutton, Oundle, Northamptonshire.</p> <p>\"They had a day off to go to Alton Towers. They do this kind of thing quite often,\" said farm owner Anne Long, 79, who runs the business with her husband and three of her four children.</p> <p>Long said some the workers lived on the farm during the fruit picking season, while others found accommodation in nearby Peterborough, Cambridgeshire.</p> <p>She said her family first heard about the crash when her daughter got a call from one of the passengers just after 6pm last night.</p> <p>\"My daughter rushed straight up there to help. Most of the workers are back here now. Everyone is in shock.\"</p> <p>The Polish man who had died was known as \"Peter\" and had come to work at Lutton Farm every summer for three or four years, she added.</p> <p>\"That's not his real name because he has a Polish name but everyone knew him as Peter. He was a good guy, we've had him here for three or four years.</p> <p>The coach, from Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, was travelling from Alton Towers theme park towards Alton village, <a href=\" http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=Alton,+Stoke-on-trent,+Staffordshire,+United+Kingdom&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;cd=1&amp;geocode=0,52.976498,-1.893695&amp;ll=52.982731,-1.887846&amp;spn=0.016226,0.036306&amp;z=15\">along Station Road</a>, when it crashed shortly before 6pm last night.</p> <p>It collided with two parked cars and smashed through a wall before plunging 10 to 15 feet down an embankment, Staffordshire police said.</p> <p>The coach eventually came to a stop on its side, in a resident's garden.</p> <p>Chief Inspector John Maddox from Staffordshire police said today: \"We're currently carrying out enquiries into how this crash happened, gathering evidence from the scene and speaking to witnesses.</p> <p>\"This is likely to take some time given the nature of the incident and the diverse background of those involved. We have a number of interpreters helping us and our officers are currently liaising with the relevant embassies to keep them fully informed.\"</p> <p>He said police investigators and specialist vehicle examiners would be working at the scene for much of the day and Station Road would remain closed, causing potential travelling difficulties to visitors to Alton Towers.</p> <p>\"We apologise for any inconvenience this causes to local residents and Alton Towers visitors and would encourage those planning a trip later today to check the latest travel news, or Alton Towers website.\"</p> <p>Last night, Bradley Ford, a local resident and one of the first witnesses at the crash scene, said: \"I heard this massive crash and rumble - crunching metal. It sounded initially like a thunderstorm, but then we heard shouts and screams,\" he said.</p> <p>\"From what I could see, a coach had crashed at the hill <br>and ploughed through a neighbour's garden. It ploughed through two cars parked in a driveway. One of them was bouncing down the road, the other must have flown along with the coach.</p> <p>\"It must have dropped about 20ft. It was on a slope. There were people climbing out of the fire exits on the bus. The majority were walking wounded.</p> <p>\"There's a bad bend at the bottom of the hill which is in line with the neighbour's driveway. They couldn't have managed to take the corner and had no choice but to go through.\"</p> <p>Martin Bredda, who lives nearby said \"It's an extremely dangerous road, a narrow country road. It's mayhem, absolute mayhem. We had a torrential downpour just before it happened. I was in the pub when someone came in screaming for blankets and sheets. We all went to help, but the area had been cordoned off.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>Just 40 gold medals to go </strong></p> <p>1848: James Marshall finds gold-dust in the bucket of his waterwheel in Sutter's mill in Coloma, California.</p> <p>1896: Skookum Jim Mason pulls a nugget out of Bonanza creek in Klondike, north-west Canada.</p> <p>2008: Nicole Cooke crosses the line first in the women's road race in Beijing.</p> <p>Yup, the British gold rush sparked by Cooke is getting mighty frenzied. Paul Goodison bagged the 13th gold of the Games for Britain in the Laser class sailing. Stopping only briefly to ask \"what is Laser class sailing?\" the thousands of British fans and spectators in China will once again burst into bouts of celebratory gloating. God Save The Queen has been more ubiquitous in Beijing than any song except the anthems of China, the US, that awful pap by Sarah Brightman and Liu Han, and Kim Wilde's Kids in America.</p> <p>Minutes later they will be back on their feet again. This time for cyclists, who are by far the greatest British success story of the Games. The astonishing haul of five golds won by the 25-person team is set to rise, rise and rise again later today.</p> <p>With the day's cycling due to start at 9.30am BST the British fans in the stands of the Laoshan velodrome will soon be popping up and down like cuckoo clocks. Chris Hoy and Jason Kenny are on course for an all-British showdown in the men's sprint, Victoria Pendleton should go in the final of the women's equivalent provided she comes through her semi-final, while Bradley Wiggins and Mark Cavendish will contest the final of the Madison. That last event should see Wiggins win his seventh Olympic medal and is guaranteed to cause a spike in admission charts at casualty wards across the country, as kids try to emulate the slingshot handshakes riders use to propel their relay partners into the race.</p> <p>Winning all three events would mean that the British cycling team had won eight golds, more than the entire nation won at any single Olympic Games between 1924 and 1996. It would also be enough to make this Britain's most successful Games in a century. They've a way to go to beat the bullion tally from 1908 mind, when Britain provided more than a third of the 1,800 athletes at the London Games and won the small matter of 56 golds. With three more possible today, that's just 40 to go people.</p> <p><strong>Latest news</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/19/olympicsathletics.olympics20081?DCMP=EMC-E_BEI_EMS\">Encouraging morning for Brits in the Bird's Nest</a><br>Jade Johnson and Goldie Sayers qualified for the long jump and javelin respectively, while Emily Freeman and American favourite Allyson Felix both progressed in the 200m heats.<br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global/2008/aug/19/olympics2008.olympicstriathlon?DCMP=EMC-E_BEI_EMS\"><br>Britain fails to win first medal in triathlon</a><br>Alistair Brownlee was the highest British finisher in this morning's men's triathlon, coming home in 12th place.

Having already cleared 4.45m, Murer discovered that one of her poles had disappeared from the arena, misplaced by officials. Furious, she refused to take any more jumps and stood, arms folded across her chest, in the middle of the runway refusing to budge until her pole was found. China's Shuying Gao was made to wait, bemused, while officials fixed the problem and the stadium announcer apologised for the \"minor technical problem\". They did get her pole back, eventually, and Murer promptly failed to make any of her next three jumps and was eliminated. </p> <p>Good to see that the Beijing authorities have acceded to media pressure and finally released details of the application procedure for those disgruntled citizens wishing to use the offical \"protest zones\" in parks across the city. There have been, authorities said, 77 requests for the right to protest from 149 people. Encouraging news for freedom of speech activists everywhere then. Except that, ah, 74 of those requests were \"withdrawn after amicable settlements between the authorities and the parties concerned\". Two more were \"suspended due to incomplete procedures\" and the 77th was \"rejected because it was in violation of demonstration law\". All of which brings the grand total of protesters to have made it through the paperwork to the parks themselves to, umm, zero. </p> <p>Perhaps NBC don't realise quite how much the Olympics can grab people's imagination.

  "<p>The Israeli government's decision to halt immigration from Ethiopia prompted <a href=\"http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1218710383397&amp;pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull\">angry scenes</a> in Jerusalem on Sunday, during a protest outside the prime minister's house. Around 5,000 demonstrators voiced their condemnation of the authorities' actions, with the chairman of the Organisation of Ethiopian Immigrants in Israel describing the situation as \"a crime against Zionism, and the original Zionist idea of saving Jews from around the world\". </p> <p>Israel is stuck between a rock and a hard place when it comes to absorbing new olim [immigrants], largely thanks to the small print in the country's immigration policy. Mirroring Hitler's assertion that anyone with at least one Jewish grandparent was to be considered <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Untermensch\"><em>untermenschen</em></a>, the founding fathers of Israel declared that anyone with similar ancestry would therefore qualify for full citizenship of the newborn state. </p> <p>Over the years, millions of Jews have taken up this offer, and today around 15% of Israel's seven million population is made up of <a href=\"http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3485951,00.html\">first-generation olim</a>. Of that number, the vast majority come from the former Soviet Union, and the next largest group hail from Ethiopia, a country which has seen a mass migration of its native Jews to Israel dating back to the 1970s. </p> <p>The most famous airlift of Ethiopian \u00e9migr\u00e9s was in 1991, with the country on the brink of collapse as rebels closed in on the capital, Addis Ababa. <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/376225.stm\">Operation Solomon</a> saw more than 14,000 Ethiopian Jews flown to safety in the space of a day and a half, heralding a new wave of Ethiopian immigration that has continued unabated to the present day. </p> <p>During one of my pre-barmitzvah trips to Israel, my family and I stumbled across an incredible scene in the streets of Jerusalem, as thousands of grateful participants in Operation Solomon flooded the city, marching jubilantly through the centre of town declaring their thanks for their salvation. The atmosphere was electric and highly-charged, their presence seemingly a sign of the lengths to which the Israeli authorities would go in order to rescue any imperilled Jew, regardless of where in the world they lived, or the colour of their skin. </p> <p>Less than two decades on, it is clear that Israel's relationship with its incoming <a href=\"http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/ejhist.html\">Ethiopian brethren</a> has soured somewhat. Human nature seemingly dictates that bad blood often exists between different ethnic groups, and Israel is no different. Despite being a largely homogenous country, in terms of religious background at least, the spectre of racism rears its ugly head between the various types of Jew making up the populace. </p> <p>As one Ethiopian girl commented, when I interviewed her last summer, \"There's racism everywhere [in Israel] - against Filipinos, and against Yemenis; although we seem to have replaced the Yemeni these days.\" Her words echoed those of the Ethiopian boys with whom I served in the army, many of whom complained of their lack of prospects in a country that simply \"sees us as no better than the Arabs\". </p> <p>Of course, there is no denying that absorbing the hundreds of thousands of Ethiopians who have made it to Israel's shores has sapped huge sums of money from the country's coffers, with the average cost of integrating an Ethiopian immigant estimated to be around \u00a360,000. However, cost alone cannot play a part in deciding which Jews can or can't qualify as olim, according to the principles on which the state was founded. </p> <p>Government ministers declare their intention to end Ethiopian immigration in one breath, and with the next announce plans to \"invest vast resources in increasing the scope of aliyah [immigration]\", which gives a clue as to quite the type of immigrant the authorities would rather encourage. Rich westerners are the flavour of the month, with both the government and <a href=\"http://www.nbn.org.il/index.php\">private organisations</a> throwing thousands of dollars at potential olim from the US, the UK and mainland Europe. These immigrants cost far less to the Israeli taxpayer, and are generally seen as a beneficial influence on both the country's economy and society as a whole. </p> <p>In the meantime, thousands of Ethiopians with Jewish roots still languish in refugee camps in Gondar, desperately praying that the Israeli government will relent and allow them too to come to the Jewish state. Israeli authorities have used the smokescreen of disputing the authenticity of their Jewishness as reason to abandon them, despite the Sephardi Chief Rabbi of Israel declaring that calling a halt to their immigration is fundamentally wrong under Jewish law. </p> <p>Israel has set itself up to have, in essence, an open-door policy to world Jewry in the same way as the EU allows freedom of movement throughout its realm to all citizens of member states. By taking a stance such as Israel is maintaining now, its government is beginning to resemble a spin-off of Italy's <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/2459968/Italy-declares-state-of-emergency-over-Roma-immigrants.html\">anti-Roma leaders</a> seemingly prepared to rewrite the rules on the basis of which type of immigrant is most desirable to its people. In doing so, Israel's rulers are ripping up the rule-book on which the state was founded, to the detriment of thousands of Ethiopians left out in the cold. </p>",
  "<p><strong>19.34</strong> Well, that's it from the velodrome. Hope you've enjoyed the ride. And for any non-British readers who have stuck with it this far, heartiest congratulations. To be honest, this is just about as good as it gets for Team GB. Forgive us, therefore, if the Guardian mask of studied impartiality has occasionally slipped somewhat. And next time you pop out for a ride on your bike, think of Chris Hoy's thighs and pedal a little faster.</p> <p><strong>19.17</strong> No wonder the tears are flowing already. He won a gold in the time trials in Athens but this is something else. We should not forget Kenny, either. A silver medal at the age of 20 is unlikely to be his last. He just doesn't have Hoy's rampaging power and finishing strength. Nor does anyone else at these Games.</p> <p><strong>19.14</strong> He can't do it! It's HOY the history-maker! A third gold medal of the Games, the first Briton to achieve that feat in 100 years. He started on a BMX bike at the age of seven; now, at the age of 32, his place among cycling's greats is assured.</p> <p><strong>19.08</strong> Total respect to Pendleton, a charming and gifted athlete at the peak of her powers, but there's barely time to wrap herself in a Union Jack before the men's sprint finals resume. Three laps, as before, with the onus on Kenny to catch Hoy unawares and see off the flying Scotsman.</p> <p><strong>19.04</strong> FABULOUS STUFF! IT'S GOLD FOR PENDLETON! Never in doubt, she had the race won before she even entered the final straight. Britain's sixth cycling gold of these Games is in the bag.</p> <p><strong>19.00</strong> Here she comes! It's tough on Vicky P that, because of the way the schedule has panned out, she is likely to get overshadowed by Hoy's quest for triple gold. That should not detract from her consummate racing over two days here when, frankly, she has blitzed all-comers. Her and Meares have a bit of 'previous' in big races but this appears to be Pendleton's race to lose.</p> <p><strong>18.55</strong> Brief lull while we get the races for the minor placings out of the way. Don't go away, though, because Pendleton will be back on shortly.</p> <p><strong>18.46</strong> It's HOY! Kenny did his best to get away early but the powerhouse caught him on the line. He looks unstoppable...</p> <p><strong>18.43</strong> And here comes the big one! That's Hoy, obviously, whose trouser-buying habits have apparently become the subject of speculation following a casual enquiry in the Guardian this week as to how he finds a pair capable of accommodating his huge thighs. We'll leave that one to the fashion experts....all I can say is that Hoy could be just the quick, powerful back-row forward Scotland have been looking for.</p> <p><strong>18.36</strong> Don't despair. The great thing about cycling at these Games is that there's always another GB medal around the corner. Pendleton has just won the first race of her final against Meares in commanding fashion. And if that hasn't cheered you up, here's a treat for all you new Madison fans out there...</p> <p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU40d5YVmYo</p> <p><strong>18.27</strong> Congrats, obviously, to the Argentine pair of Juan Esteban Curuchet and Walter Fernando Perez on pricking the GB bubble without any hint of 'Hand of God' controversy. To say the Brits are disappointed with their effort, though, would appear to be a substantial understatement. Cavendish immediately disappeared down the ramp out of the arena without a hint of a backward glance, let alone a consolatory arm around Wiggins. Up in the stands, Mr Blair looks rather less chirpy. Maybe his successor knows more about cycling than we imagined.</p> <p><strong>18.24</strong> It's OVER. Argentina gold, Spain silver, Russia bronze...and GB eighth. Not good enough on the day, sadly.</p> <p><strong>18.22</strong> Argentina, Russia and Spain look to be the gold medal contenders, with Belgium lurking. This is not how it it was supposed to be.</p> <p><strong>18.19</strong> It's just not happening. Whenever Cavendish looks about to surge away, the momentum is never quite sustained. Only 12 laps to go...</p> <p><strong>18.17</strong> If we are going to see a glorious British attack, it has got to happen soon. And here it comes, bang on cue! Cavendish is away again, giving Wiggins a flying handover. But after eight of the 10 sprints, GB are still only in 10th place. Don't let anyone tell you these gold medals are easy to win.</p> <p><strong>18.11</strong> Tell you what, these boys are brave. Or stupid. Just a reminder to those who have never ridden one of these racing bikes that there is one crucial design flaw. They don't have brakes. So when you're whizzing around the bend and the bloke in front of you cuts you up, you need extraordinary reactions to stay alive. Cavendish is unbelievable in a crowd. They clearly don't take much notice of Health and Safety restrictions on the Isle of Man.</p> <p><strong>18.06</strong> Right, we're approaching the final third of the race, a mere 60 laps to go. The Kiwis, the Danes and the Germans are on the attack, the Brits are biding their time. We're approaching crunch time...</p> <p><strong>18.01</strong> Is this a good moment to talk about the roof of this stadium, a wonderful spoke-inspired circular design? Of course not, you idiot. Concentrate, this is important.</p> <p><strong>17.59</strong> Don't panic, Mr Mainwaring. The gleaming-domed boss of GB cycling, Dave Brailsford, is leaning nonchalently against the the bike-racks with the air of a man convinced it'll come good in the end. Cavendish is suddenly going like a train, the pack has been split. C'mon, lads!</p> <p><strong>17.52</strong> Hmm. A fair amount of groaning amongst the cognoscenti. The Brits are leaving themselves with a lot to do and the fast-paced race they would have ideally preferred has not yet materialised. At least the Italians have been reined in but Team GB's magic touch is not yet evident.</p> <p><strong>17.46</strong> Significant moment. Italy make an early move and gain a lap on the rest of the field. Argentina are trying to do the same. The rest of the pack, though, are doing their best to put the Italians firmly back in their place by upping the pace. Only 136 laps to go, though....</p> <p><strong>17.42</strong> Just kidding, I know precisely what's happening now I've consulted my esteemed colleague, the guru otherwise known as the Guardian's chief cycling correspondent. We've had two sprints so far and, frankly, it's not been the greatest start. The Brits have missed out on early points which was the gameplan. Cavendish won four stages of this year's Tour de France, however, so if there's some late sprinting to be done there is no-one out there with more gas....</p> <p><strong>17.39</strong> The Danes are winning, I'm told. Early days, though....</p> <p>17.30 And they're away in the Madison. This'll be fun. Imagine a whole load of coloured clothes spinning around in a washing machine and you'll get some idea of how easy it is to keep an eye on a specific rider. One minute they're belting along the inside, the next they're hanging around up on the banking. Ah yes, the banking. It's a 44 degree slope, apparently, and standing up on the top of it is scary enough, let alone taking a bike up there. The mad men of the Madison. Hmm, maybe I'll go home and write a stylish TV series when this is all over...</p> <p><strong>17.26</strong> Not a spare seat in the stadium now. If Gordon Brown's planning a late dash, he's left it too late. Next up is the Madison, the race the connoisseurs drool over. It takes its name from Madison Square Garden in New York where they dreamed up a new set of rules over a century ago to prevent cyclists becoming exhausted in six-day races. It's not a million miles away from tag wrestling, with teams consisting of two riders in a race run over a distance of 50km (200 laps) with intermediate sprints. Here, if you're interested, are the rules in full: The final placing will be determined by the accumulated points in the sprints, which occur every 20 laps, or by the distance according to the complete laps covered by each team. Teams having covered the same number of laps will be placed according to their accumulated points. Where there is a draw on laps and points, the place during the final sprint shall decide the final result. Sprint points will be awarded as follows: 5 points to the first team, 3 points to the second, 2 points to the third and 1 point to the fourth.</p> <p>Simple, eh? All you really need to know is that Wiggins and Cavendish are bloody good at it. By the way, Guo Shang has just missed out on the final against Pendleton after a re-run race caused when she fell off during the cat-mouse phase and was then disqualified for entering the sprinters' lane alongside Meares in the closing dash. This is China, a country which boasts over 300 million bicycles. It's fair to say the organisers would have loved to see her in the final.</p> <p><strong>17.08</strong> Surprise, surprise, it's an all-Brit final. Kenny shreds Levy and it'll be fascinating to see what happens next. The GB tactical sprint coach Jan Van Eijden advises both men but, clearly, he's in an impossible position now. It's a bit like Venus and Serena Williams playing each other. Hoy's the senior man, though, and will fancy his chances.</p> <p><strong>17.04</strong> And it's Hoy in the final! These races are supposed to be nip and tuck but he's strolled this one. He's looking unbelievably strong and, frankly, invincible. But these are the Olympics, things can always go wrong. Theoretically.</p> <p><strong>17.00</strong> Not sure who Vicky will be racing in the final yet. Meares has come back at her, winning the second race to set up a third and final decider. The speed at which all these riders hurtle off the banking is just unreal.</p> <p><strong>16.53</strong> Beijing time Never mind the star-gazing, we're here for the sport. Jason Kenny is perhaps the least well-known of Britain's individual medal hopefuls but he also looks quick, strong and purposeful as he pips Maximilian Levy to bring a final showdown with Hoy ever-closer. But, hold on, what's this? Another familiar face...why, it's the Princess Royal! There's a clear pecking order here...Bernie's had to move seats. Presumably Lord Coe, Sir Clive Woodward and Dame Helen Mirren will be along shortly. Honestly, cycling really is becoming the new rock and roll. And Vicky P is in the final, coming from nowhere to pip Willy Kanis (nice name for a girl) on the line and guarantee herself at least a silver.</p> <p><strong>16.42</strong> Chris Hoy, already Scotland's most prolific Olympian, romps away with his opening duel against Mickael Bourgain of France but we're suddenly peering at a couple of notable spectators down below. Look, there's Bernie Ecclestone, clearly here to check whether F1 has got a new track rival. And, crikey, there's Tony Blair sitting a bit further along the same row. Clearly he's trying to steal some of that bike-loving David Cameron's thunder...please insert your own Norman Tebbit-themed joke here.</p> <p><strong>16.36</strong> Yes, okay, I know it's Pendleton but the excitement is already rising here and it's clearly affecting my typing. At least I got Guo Shuang right...and she's just won her first race against Australia's Anna Meares.</p> <p><strong>16.31</strong> And then they go mad, dipping down off the banking and swooping like eagles. Pembleton wins it by a comfortable margin but it's best-of-three and she still needs one more win to make the final.</p> <p><strong>16.30</strong> Right, here we go. They've just flashed up the medal table showing Britain already have nine medals, with Spain their nearest rivals on two. Just the sort of encouragement Vicky needs. Mind you, they don't exactly flash out of the blocks here.....imagine a cat stalking a mouse and you get the general idea, at least for lap one.</p> <p><strong>16.29</strong> Actually, I was wrong earlier when I suggested there were no other riders of interest here except the gallant Brits. China's Guo Shang could well end up facing Pembleton in the women's sprint final and looked pretty sharp in the semis yesterday. Splendidly, she hails from Inner Mongolia which I like to imagine as a rather neat, suburban, mowed-lawn and picket-fence type of place where the hordes go to play whist and bingo when they're not roaming the inhospitable plains. Or maybe not. Either way, she's one to watch.</p> <p><strong>16.16</strong> Beijing time Let me set the scene while we're waiting. If you've never been inside a velodrome they take a bit of getting used to. No hidden dressing-rooms here, the riders and their equipment is all open to public inspection in the middle of the track. It's a bit like having a seat above an operating theatre as people in masks extract vital organs before your eyes. Well, not quite but they're frantically busy in a cool, calm, measured type of way, making sure that every last little detail is just so. Around them the cyclists circle their practice laps, exuding that slightly other-worldly fitness and focus so common among elite athletes. Part of me wishes they had paper bags slung across their shoulders and had to lob a copy of China Daily into a letter-box at the end of every lap but, clearly, that would be a silly idea.</p> <p><strong>Preamble</strong>: Well, morning to all and welcome to what must be the first live cycling blog in Guardian history. For those of you who don't know a Madison from a set of bike clips, don't panic. Something tells me this may not be the most sophisticated technical blog you'll ever stumble across but we'll be doing our best to keep you up to date with potentially the most significant three hours British track cycling has seen in 100 years of Olympic competition. Chris Hoy and Bradley Wiggins are both seeking their third gold medals of these Games, a feat no Brit has managed since a certain Henry Taylor earned three swimming golds in London in 1908. Victoria Pendleton is also going for gold - sorry, this sort of excitable stuff is hard to avoid - and you'll also be hearing plenty about Mark Cavendish and Jason Kenny.</p> <p>As I write there are platoons of cyclists from other nations whizzing around the track just below me here at the Laoshan Velodrome but, in theory, they're only here to make the numbers. That, at least, is what the greybeards tell me and the excitement is practically dripping off them. Considering the low profile of British cycling just a few years ago, this is the amateur biker's equivalent of England winning the Ashes and the Rugby World Cup rolled into one. Or bigger still, depending on your point of view. So feel free to show your support (and impress your co-workers) by wearing your helmet at your desk and changing into the tight-fitting lycra outfit you've been saving for that REALLY special occasion. Failing that, simply sit back and, ahem, get in touch with your inner Chopper. First to go is Vicky P in the women's sprint semis scheduled to start at 4.30pm local time....</p> <p>Find out how all the overnight action unfolded <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global/2008/aug/19/olympics2008\">here</a>, including news of Great Britain's 13th gold, courtesy of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/19/goodisonsailing\">Paul Goodison</a> in the Laser sailing class.</p>",

This year we made your cricket captain go all boo-hoo-hoo and slink off back to Yorkshire like a whipped puppy. Then we replaced him with one of ours. And yet, despite the fact that we only won our first medal of the olympics yesterday (silver in the men's long jump), there has been a lamentable lack of Saffer-baiting on this page,\" says Simon Rhoades in Cape Town. \"Is this the result of a) stoic British forbearance, b) sheer carelessness, or c) a realisation that we only care about proper sports and not silly nonsense like horse disco and larking about in dinghies that everyone pretends to enthuse about every four years? I think we should be told.\" Ha! Your total ignorance of all things British is revealed Rhoades, we're rubbish at horse disco.</p> <!-- Block 92 --> <p><strong>8.47am: </strong> Away from the cauldron of the water polo, to bring humdrum news of another British medal hopeful. Tim Brabants wins his heat of the 500m kayak. The 1km is his speciality - he's through the heats in that too - so a good effort from Brabants.</p> <!-- Block 91 --> <p><strong>8.41am: </strong>Dr Samuel Johnson's back for the second semi of the water polo. It's Hungary v Netherlands and Dr Sam loves the Dutch swimsuits: \"The girls (WOMEN! WOMEN! WOMEN! THEY'RE WOMEN!) look [small moan] great.\"</p> <!-- Block 90 --> <p><strong>8.35am: </strong>And if you want to win some tickets to South Africa's thumping of England in the ODI series click here.

By the way, we'll be handing over to our man Rob Kitson in the velodrome around nine for live interweb blogging (it's the future apparently), before he hands over to Anna Kessel in the Bird's Nest for the athletics.</p> <!-- Block 88 --> <p><strong>8.27am: </strong>Ten seconds to go, and the Aussies call a time out. Dr Samuel Johnson is so excited he invents at least four new words. The Aussies can't craft a chance though, and the US are through to the final. Dr Sam signs off with a rather hopeful \"We'll return you to the studios\" as if the BBC have lined up a team of pundits to analyse the action. Which they really should have done.</p> <!-- Block 87 --> <p><strong>8.23am: </strong> The US are camped in the shallow end, and the pressure pays off: it's 9-8 to the Americans with a minute to go. <a href=\"http://www.theage.com.au/news/latest-news/poms-are-winning-call-an-inquiry/2008/08/18/1218911573038.html\">Tom Gilbert brings us more news of Aussie woe here</a>.</p> <!-- Block 86 --> <p><strong>8.21am: </strong> 8-8! And the crowd, all seven of them, are going crazy.</p> <!-- Block 85 --> <p><strong>8.20am: </strong> This game would be much better if I could actually see the ball, I think the Aussies just hit the post, but it might have just been one of them slamming their head against the crossbar. The commentator, Dr Samuel Johnson, comes up with the rather grand claim that he invented the word \"faith\". 8-7 with two minutes to go.</p> <!-- Block 84 --> <p><strong>8.14am: </strong>Hello, water polo is the best thing ever invented ever. EVER. The Aussies save a penalty, counter-attack and make it 8-7.</p> <!-- Block 83 --> <p><strong>8.13am: </strong>It's 8-5 in the women's water polo between the USA and Australia - yep, it really has come to this - and incredibly the BBC have found not just a commentator on the water polo, but a pundit too. And Australia have scored! 8-6 to the US.</p> <!-- Block 82 --> <p><strong>8.03am: </strong>\"If it's new Olympic events for London 2012 you're after then how about the 4x400m money laundering relay, 10m air pistol equity bubble bursting and the mixed doubles finger-pointing. Three golds for sure! As for the stadium, it's got to be distended, tubular and an unnatural red colour - The Saveloy!\" says Stephen Spencer. I was acquitted of all money laundering charges, Spencer I think we should all move on now.</p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p><strong>7.55am:</strong> There's still diddly-squat happening people so I'm about to pass the MBM baton to my good friend Mr T Lutz. He's wearing a new hoody and is looking pretty mean today I might add. But before I go here's a suggestion for a London 2012 stadium from Alex in Sydney: \"The People's Citadel of Supreme Sporting Endeavour.\" God loves a trier Alex, so it's not a bad suggestion.</p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>7.47am:</strong> With a look ahead to the cycling in an hour or so you might want to put your money on the best dressed pedaler - that's what Stephen Spencer seems to do. \"Britain may have dominated the cycling but I'm awarding the best dressed gold to the Kiwis. The ride-off for bronze in the men's team pursuit against Australia was like watching the four horsemen of the apocalypse hunting down a flock of frightened budgies.\" I've never seen a frightened budgie Stephen and I'm a bit suspicious as to how you've seen such a thing. So suspicious in fact that I might just give the RSPB a call.</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>7.38am:</strong> The London 2012 naming brainstorm continues. \"Why don't you name the stadium in honour of your latest gold medallist?\" suggests Scott Tran. \"Goodison Park has a nice ring to it.\" I think we could have a winner here Scott. Everton's news stadium proposal would take the club <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Goodison\">so far outside Liverpool </a> they may as well move to London.</p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p><strong>7.32am:</strong> There's still nothing of note happening in Beijing. The latest results are as follows: Canada have beaten Netherlands 4-0 in the baseball and in the big one, oh yes, the women's handball quarter-final, Norway have given Sweden a good tonking 31-24. Claire Garner's just asked what time the cycling is on today though. So I can confirm that Britain will be winning more medals on two wheels from 0900BST and we'll have a live track-side blog too you lucky lot. For the full schedule of events <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympics/2008/events/aug/19\">click here</a>.</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>7.24am:</strong> The BBC are running a clip of British swimming bronze medallist in Athens, Stephen Parry, getting mobbed by People in Tiananmen Square because they think he's Michael Phelps. I've got to say that he doesn't sound too convincing when he's telling them he's not Phelps. I reckon he's signing Phelps autographs at a tenner a pop as soon as the cameras stop rolling. Spare a thought for poor Phelps too, I bet he's inundated with fans of Stephen Parry when he's off out to the corner shop for a can of Red Bull.</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>7.20am:</strong> Thanks to Tim Maitland for filling a Cheerio-sized hole in my sailing knowledge with this gem: \"Re: 6:18 'struggling to tag'. It's actually 'tack',\" says Tim. \"That's a posh word for turning (with the bow going across the wind direction).\" Okay. \"If he was turning with the bow facing the wind direction it would be a 'jibe'.\" Clock keeps ticking. MBMer look at his fingernails and wonders whether he should file them when he gets home. MBMer decides not to bother.</p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>7.10am:</strong> \"London's Olympic stadium looks like a Cheerio,\" reckons Benjamin Arthur. Cheerios taste like cardboard, so perhaps the London Games organisers could save money on the budget by building the stadium out of cardboard? Might get soggy in the rain though I suppose.</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>7am:</strong> Here's the on-the-hour news update. Earlier this morning Britain's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/19/olympicsathletics.olympics20081\">Jade Johnson scraped into the long jump final</a>... just. Britain failed to medal in the triathlon, but Sean Ingle watched young Brit <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global/2008/aug/19/olympics2008.olympicstriathlon\">Alistair Brownlee put in a ballsy performance</a> to finish 12th.</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>6.56am:</strong> Read all about it! There's a handy story about Paul Goodison's 13th gold for Britain <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/19/goodisonsailing\">right here</a>.</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>6.49am:</strong> \"What London 2012 needs is something with the crossover appeal of chessboxing,\" suggests general-fan-of-violence Andy Chan (I'll avoid the obvious wise-crack seeing as it's Rush Hour - sorry, couldn't help myself!). \"Brits would have a moderate chance of excelling at these sports given a few more years practice. I propose 'darts knife-fighting', where, as the name handily suggests, massively overweight competitors in hoodies alternately chuck darts at a board and then have at each other with 3-inch blades.\" Interesting Andy. I think 'darts knife-fighting' has been popular on the streets of London for a few years now. he kids generally start in their teens so they'll have a great chance of gold come 2012. Still nothing much going on in Beijing.</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>6.45am:</strong> BREAKING NEWS: Paul Goodison says he fancies representing Team GB in Weymouth 2012. He's waving a Union Flag around and dancing in his boat. Perhaps I was wrong about sailing being underwhelming...</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>6.42am:</strong> Paul Goodison cruises down towards the finish line and wins Britain's 13th gold medal of the Games. Sweden's Rasmus finishes sixth overall. That's got to hurt!</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>6.38am:</strong> They're on the final down-wind leg of the race and Goodison is still on target for gold. It might take him a minute or two to get to the finish line though as he's just ambling ahead of Rasmus in second-last position.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>6.35am:</strong> Goodison is a massive Sheffield United fan, for his sins. Apparently he's had Blades manager Kevin Blackwell in his boat recently. I wonder how that came about? Maybe he puts on a taxi service off the coast of Scarborough. \"Eh, you'll never guess who I had in the back o' my boat the other night...\" Maybe not eh? Goodison has now sailed Rasmuss out of the silver medal position.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>6.29am:</strong> I reckon sailing has got to be the most underwhelming way to win a gold medal. Nobody ever seems sure exactly who is in what position or when the race is actually over. And as for the poor medal-winning sailor, they have about 10 minutes in their boat before they can jump out and celebrate. Goodison is still on for gold, I can inform you.</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>6.25am:</strong> Meanwhile, in the attempts to name the London 2012 stadium, Nick Evans is back to suggest a \"bowl shaped traditional dish found in London? Chicken Balti.\" It's not a million miles from the fantastic curry houses on Brick Lane Nick, but not nearly catchy enough. \"The way Team GB!GB!GB! is performing,\" chants Steve Jenkins. \"Might I suggest Brasso as the sponsor of choice?\" Not bad Steve. The Brasso Stadium sounds gritty and very old-school East Laaaandaaan. Goodison is going to need some Brasso as it stands. He's second to last, but providing Rasmus Myrgren of Sweden doesn't win, then Goodison will bring home Britain's 13th gold.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>6.18am:</strong> Goodison just needs to beat his nearest rival Rasmus Myrgren of Sweden to win gold, I believe. I can't say I'm an expert on boats and things aquatic but I do know that he's 'struggling to tag'. I presume that's a problem for Goodison. There's not enough wind apparently, but he's still leading overall.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>6.14am:</strong> Action at last! Well if you can call sailing action. GB's Paul Goodison has started cruising towards a medal in the men's laser class. I'll keep you updated as he goes.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>6.12am:</strong> \"More yank bashing,\" tubthumps Nick Evans somewhere in the States. \"I've had to endure bleating about the exclusion of softball from future the Olympics \"because we are too good\". Perhaps the US is the only nation that plays it? Am I correct in thinking that along with beach volleyball, softball was introduced at the Atlanta games in 1996? I wonder what sports could be introduced in London which are sufficiently arcane that we would bolster our medal tally? Perhaps Gurning with an Olympic standard horse collar, or chasing a cheese (or other object) down a hill whilst intoxicated?\" I only want to see one thing at London 2012 Nick, Phil 'The Power' Taylor wiping the floor with the opposition in a dingy East London pub. That'd be guaranteed gold.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>6.05am:</strong> I believe we're riffing on what London's 2012 stadium could be called to compete with the Beijing Bird's Nest. John Senior has this to offer: \"Presumably the Bird's Nest is inspired by the Chinese soup of the same name. For London, given the required shape, surely it has to be the Yorkshire Pudding.\" Just one snag with that John, it's 200 miles from Yorkshire. Next!</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>6am:</strong> Good morning people. I hope you've had an Olympic-sized sleep wherever you may be. As Howard has already informed you there's not an awful lot going on in China this morning. The beach volleyball has kept us night folk of Farringdon Road entertained thus far however. And I can inform you that in the all-Chinese semi-final Tian Jia and Wang have beaten their compatriots Xue and Zhang Xi. Amazing huh?</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>5.45am:</strong> Great news: the beach volleyball has gone into a deciding set. But that's going to be Gregg Roughley's problem, since he's here to take over another mighty tail-off in the minute-by-minute. Email him at <a href=\"mailto:gregg.roughley@theguardian.com\">gregg.roughley@theguardian.com</a></p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>5.43am:</strong> It's 27-27 in this beach volleyball, and I'm really hoping that this isn't recorded because I'm getting moderately diverted by it for nothing, if so. I have a limited resource of moderate diversion and I don't want to squander it.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>5.40am:</strong> Ideas for the London Olympic Stadium names are flooding in at the rate of three in the past hour. This from Andrew Jolly: \"We need something that encompasses the feeling of antipathy, followed by great hope, finishing in abject despair that being a British sports supporter is all about (Team GB!GB!GB! 2008 aside). Maybe the Paula Radcliffe Stadium? The England Euro 96 Stadium?\"</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>5.37am:</strong> Oh, and as a (somewhat crucial) addition to that last undate, Xue/Zhang Xi lead by one set to nil, so they need to win this one to reach the final. It's 24-24 now.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>5.36am:</strong> It's 21-21 in the second set of the all Chinese women's beach volleyball struggle between Tian Ji/Wang and Xue/Zhang Xi. And it the time it's taken to write that, it's 22-22 and they have to go to 24 to decide the winner. Titanic.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>5.30am:</strong> <strong>Predictable weather update from our man in Beijing:</strong> There's no effing wind again, which means Paul Goodison's gold medal sail has been postponed. There goes any excitement for the next three hours.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>5.24am: </strong>I'm thinking (hoping) Nick Evans is replying to Paul Savage's query at 5.13am, although his terse email is fair enough criticism of this report: \"More like the pigs ear,\" he says.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>5.23am: </strong>Quick update from the various streams on my computer: </p> <p><strong>Brazil lead Japan in the first game in the quarter-finals of the women's volleyball</strong>; there's some <strong>table tennis</strong> happening, which is massively popular in China, less so in Farringdon; and two <strong>Chinese beach volleyball teams</strong> are going head to head in the second semi-final for the right to play the American duo in the final.</p> <p>And John Senior is no child development expert, but is going to stick his neck out anyhow: \"If Mrs Wool is due next month, I suspect Wool Junior will have outgrown his/her bottle by the time of the next Olympics. My advice: Invest in a big TV with multi-screen so Junior can sit on your knee watching CBeebies all day while you enjoy the sport. If Mrs. Wool grows suspicious, tell her you're using the Games to teach Junior about world geography and flags. (If Junior's a girl, of course, the Wool family could always move to China, delete the L from their surname, and try to get her a spot on the 2012 gymnastics team.)\"</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>5.13am:</strong> Paul Savage is in Nairobi, and I feel kind of guilty about only quoting this part of his very genial email. \"If the Chinese have the Bird's Nest \u2013 what will we have in London 2012? What main stadium architecture best captures our nation? The Meat Pie maybe?\" There's something to sink your teeth into emailers. Chortle.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>5.06am: </strong>It's been a mighty quiet morning for Team GB so far, but have no fear rampant nationalists because we're going to get another gold medal soon in the laser class sailing. Our boy Paul Goodison starts the medal race as such a hot favourite, he's practically Australian. So long as he doesn't capsize and finish last and the Swedish boat wins, there'll be another proud Team GB!GB!GB! moment in 60 minutes or so.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>4.57am:</strong> So that's the triathlons done and Great Britain still searches for its first medal. Still, we're nailed on to win everything in 2012, because THAT'S THE LAW OF THE OLYMPICS, so tune in again then. Right now, here's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/19/olympicsathletics.olympics20081\">a round up of what's been going on in Beijing this morning</a>; here's <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/19/bolts_showboating_is_a_slap_fo.html\">Kriss Akabusi's provocative Awooga in the face of Usain Bolt</a> and here's Marina Hyde on <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/19/london_will_struggle_to_match.html\">Beijing's army of volunteers</a> helping the running of the Games.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>4.50am:</strong> <strong>Germany's Jan Frodeno wins gold in the men's triathlon. </strong>Simon Whitfield takes silver, Bevan Docherty, New Zealand, takes third. Alastair Brownlee finishes 12th, Will Clarke 14th.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>4.49am: </strong>Terrific stuff from Simon Whitfield, but NO! There's the man mountain Jan Frodeno, of Germany, who thunders past the Canadian, collapses to the carpet and takes gold.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>4.48am: There goes Whitfield. Gomez is done.</strong></p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>4.46am: </strong> Hold on, Simon Whitfield is coming back to interrupt the happy trio. Four of them for the medals, and apparently it's Whitfield with the best sprint of all of them.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>4.45am: Triathlon</strong> Despite the lack of British interest (a phrase that still types itself), this is compelling. Bevan Docherty, Javier Gomez and Jan Frodeno have gone together, and it's all about their sprint finishes.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>4.41am:</strong> That's the bell in the triathlon, with Javier Gomez leading the formidable-looking Frodeno of Germany, Docherty of New Zealand, and Whitfield, of Canada. Brownlee is back in seventh now.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>4.39am: </strong>Call off the dancing girls. Brownlee's run has now been downgraded to \"brave\", which, as we now know, means futile and not medal winning. The leading five have sprinted clear and the poor mite Brownlee is running through treacle as if in a nightmare.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>4.37am:</strong> Brownlee has some water, and he's tipped it on his head. The breakaway comprises Gomes, Frodeno, Brownlee and Docherty.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>4.35am:</strong> Six runners in the breakaway, with Brownlee one of them. Apparently Whitfield has the sprint, the Spaniards have each other, and Brownlee missed the water station.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>4.33am: </strong> The Spaniard Rana has taken over this thing, from pre-race favourite Javier Gomes. Brownlee is third, although struggling a bit now since the Spanish have taken over.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>4.32am:</strong> A huge Dane named Henning has just edged into the lead from Alaistair Brownlee, although the young Brit seems unperturbed. He's a real babyface is our Brownlee, which will delight the likes of Hazel Irvine and Sue Barker, who love that kind of thing.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>4.28am:</strong> <strong>Alaistair Brownlee leads the Olympic triathlon.</strong></p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>4.25am:</strong> I can feel big Team GB!GB!GB! stirrings here. Alastair Brownlee is officially in third place in the triathlon, and they're getting very near to the impudent Bockel and Zeebroek.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>4.22am:</strong> Alex in Sydney has some parenting advice: \"Having a child can help and also score you brownie points. You get to say things like, 'You go to bed love and I'll stay up and give him his late bottle when he wakes' rather than 'I'll be up in a minute dear, I want to watch men in very tight lycra'.\" Right now, the bulging lycra of Bockel and Zeebroek are still out in front with about a lap and a half of the running gone. The chase group, including GB!GB!GB!'s Alastair Brownlee, are about 20 seconds back.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>4.18am: </strong> Bockel and Zeebroek were about 40 seconds ahead at the transition to the running, but they both look utterly spent. The better runners are in the chasing pack, apparently, which include Britain's Alastair Brownlee. The Brit has taken the lead of that chase, although the Mexican Serrano is still in third, some way up the road.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>4.15am:</strong> <strong>Jumping and chucking news from Team GB</strong>: <strong>Jade Johnson</strong> has made it to the final of the long jump with her last leap of 6.61m. That puts her 11th in the 12-woman final. A threat, no doubt. Then <strong>Goldie Sayers</strong> propels the javelin past the qualifying mark and is into the final as well. <strong>Bockel and Zeebroek</strong> lead at the transition to the running in the triathlon.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>4.05am: Triathlon: </strong>Apparently the Mexican Francisco Serrano isn't pulling his weight in the three-man breakaway, and Axel Zeebroek is turning round asking for him to take the lead so that him and the other rider -- Luxembourg's Dirk Bockel -- can get in his slipstream. It falls on deaf ears as Serrano sits in the middle of the three.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>4am: Triathlon: </strong>There's a three-man breakaway, led by Francisco Serrano of Mexico, and also includes thrash-metal's Axel Zeebroek. Brownlee is in the chasng group, about 28 seconds back. \"Perhaps you could ask readers on my behalf how their sports-watching (or Guardian-online-reading) habits changed after having a child?\" wonders Charles Wool. \"Wife expecting next month; occurred to me that Olympics may never be the same.\" Anyone?</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>3.57am:</strong> According to the great God Wiki,\" says Alex in Sydney, \"in Krzygstan they still practice the illegal tradition of bride kidnapping.\" [Legal note: sue Wiki if this is wrong. Or Alex.] \"Perhaps if kidnapping was introduced to some of the events, the plucky Krzygs could motor up the medals table.\" Well, they do have those league tables for serial killers (in which Team GB!GB!GB!'s is a contender), so perhaps for 2012.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>3.54am:</strong> \"How is GB!GB!GB! actually pronounced?\" asks Peter Roy. \"Is it in a deep booming voice with a pause between each GB similar to the USA, USA, USA? Or is it more a GBGBGB, similar to the robot Twiki's ramblings from the Buck Rogers series?\" At the moment, it's pronounced very quietly indeed.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>3.52am:</strong> The American Matt Reed, a cycling specialist, has taken the lead in the triathlon. Brownlee is still able to see them, if he looks hard, and might reckon he can catch them in the run.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>3.48am: </strong>Halfway through the bike section in the triathlon, and the news is that Alastair Brownlee had a very good swim. It says a lot. The Belgian Croes is still out front.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>3.45am: </strong>Emily Freeman comes through her 200m heat comfortably. She finishes second, but that's good enough. Marko Albert and Peter Croes lead in the cycling section of the triathlon, as the field stretches. Brit watch has become slightly more dispiriting. Brownlee is ninth, Clarke about 20th, Tim Done=done.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>3.41am: Fire alarm news: It works.</strong></p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>3.37am: Triathlon: </strong> The Brownlee breakaway has been swallowed up by the main group. Tim Don, son of refereeing's Philip Don, is a minute behind the main pack and is \"not 100 percent\", according to his agent, who has a hotline to the Beeb's commentators. \"A fire alarm test at 3:30 a.m.?\" says John Senior. \"That should be popular with the Guardian's neighbors.\" They're used to it, John. Usually it's the big Monday night muesli roast, which can get a bit rowdy.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>3.34am:</strong> Alastair Brownlee started off as a runner, so there would be high hopes for Team GB! GB! GB! if he can get to the running section ahead. And just as I type that, the plucky Brit breaks away from the pack on his own on the bike and this might, <em>might</em> turn into something worth jingo-ing about.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>3.31am: Men's triathon: </strong>The Olympic record holder, Cuba's Osleidys Menendez, is sixth in the first pool of the javelin, and she might not qualify. Jenkins of Canada still leads the triathlon, with Brownlee, the 2006 World Junior Triathlon champion, second.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>3.26am:</strong> The Canadian Colin Jenkins takes the lead in the cycling leg of the triathlon, as the Guardian Towers security guard informs us that there'll be a fire alarm test in 10 minutes. \"Don't worry though,\" he adds to four ashen faces.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>3.22am:</strong> 40km on the bikes in the triathlon, and Alastair Brownlee and Frederic Belaubre attempt to elope. It doesn't last long, and they're hauled back in before they reach Gretna.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>3.21am:</strong> \"Baiting Kyrgyzstan is unfair on a nation suffering a chronic vowel shortage,\" zings Chris Wright. Meanwhile, Tim Don and Will Clarke have gone missing in the triathlon.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>3.19am:</strong> There are no members of Team GB in the men's 3m springboard, so it doesn't exist as far as we're concerned. Meanwhile, Shane Reed has become the first triathlete to crawl out of the water, with Alastair Brownlee, of GB, in 11th. It's a real evolutionary moment, that, when they crawl out of the water.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>3.15am: Men's triathlon</strong> You don't win a triathlon in the swimming section, I learnt while watching the women's race yesterday. But for what it's worth, Shane Reed of New Zealand is leading, from Frederic Belaubre of France and Igor Sysoev.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>3.04am: Men's triathlon</strong> Suddenly everything is a go-go. The shoal of <strong>triathletes</strong> are in the water, including all the British competitors; the men's <strong>3m springboard semi-finals</strong> have started in the diving place; and the <strong>women's javelin</strong> and <strong>long jump</strong> qualifying are underway in the Bird's Nest. One pair of (tired) eyes will do their best.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>3am: Men's triathlon:</strong> Live action again, mercifully, as the men's triathlon gets started. Spain's Javier Gomez is the hot favourite; Tim Don, Alistair Brownlee and Will Clarke go for GB. It's at the Ming Tomb Reservoir, which is a spectacularly beautiful place, even on the approximate four-inch screen of this Hitachi telly.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>2.54am:</strong> Having spent the majority of his career guffawing at the slightest provocation, Kriss Akabusi had the smile wiped off his face by Usain Bolt \"showboating\" in the 100m. Why? <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/19/bolts_showboating_is_a_slap_fo.html\">Let Kriss explain in his own words.</a> Nathaniel Davis wasn't impressed: \"The fact that Bolt broke the world record while not even caring about breaking the world record is anything but showboating, it is almost too humble to fathom,\" Nathaniel says. \"For me, what made Bolt's 100m win so extraordinary and awe-inducing was not simply his speed, but his refreshingly relaxed approach to a sport that has become too technical, too inhuman. Bolt only wanted to win; I find his lack of interest in anything else inspiring.\"</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>2.50am: </strong>The<strong> women's javelin</strong> is underway in the athletics arena, the preposterously named Bird's Nest. The Czech favourite sets the early pace, with a 67.69m throw. <strong>Goldie Sayers</strong> is Great Britain's hope here, and she has her first chuck in the coming hour.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>2.44am:</strong> Andrew Jolly is getting in touch with his inner Kyrgyzstan: \"In the interest of harmonious Anglo-Kyrgyzstani relations, and in the (probable) absence of any Kyrgyzstan nationals following the MBM, could I be the first to point out that they only have a population of 5 million, and so their medals/population ratio is quite similar to the invincible Team GB!GB!GB!. Team Kyrgy!Kyrgy!Kyrgy! even has a nice ring to it.\" They call that the \"population defence\" to any medals table debate, I think.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>2.41am: Beach volleyball: </strong>Two match points are saved, one when Misty-May Treanor flaps one into the net. But then, a hopeless serve from the Brazilian player goes straight into the net, and that's that. USA win 21-12, 21-14 to book their spot in the final.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>2.39am: Beach volleyball:</strong> USA, the defending Olympic champions, are 18-12 to the good, and looking like a great bet for the final. And, eat that Sao Paulo, it's now 19-20 after a dive-smash wins one point, then a terrific block wins the second. Match point.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>2.36am:</strong> Tim Maitland has emailed: \"Re: 'Liu Xiang's Achilles tendon? Who cares.' While I completely understand that the current union-jack-waving frenzy has awakened those patriotic genes and made you want to tea-party-like-it's-1977... but billions do care.\" It was kind of a joke, Tim, but you next points are fair. \"I'm not sure that the comparison is completely accurate, but you can at least get a sense of perspective by considering what the emergence of the first great black sprinters meant to the African diaspora. Liu Xiang proved that Chinese... think Greater China and beyond, rather than the Peoples' Republic... could run fast. Running fast is sexy. Running fast is modern. Running fast is a sign of the emergence of the Chinese peoples in the 21st century ... When Liu snatched the numbers off his shorts and walked away... most silently did the same ... I've been watching sport for a living for the best part of 25 years, and it was one of the most poignant moments I can remember.\"</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>2.30am:</strong> It's 10-10 in the second game of the beach volleyball. \"Very disappointed to hear there will be no Aussie-baiting today,\" says Will Sinclair, who was in the thick of it last night, if I remember. \"In it's place, can I suggest we revert to Kyrgyzstan-baiting? A quick review of the medal tally indicates that the small former Soviet state has only won a single bronze, a single silver and NO GOLD! Go back to playing your komuz (a three stringed lute, apparently), you LOSERS! Any Kyrgyzstanians care to mount a defence for their hopelessly outclassed nation?\" I'm not holding out a lot of hope for this, but the challenge is there.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>2.23am:</strong> Oliver Pattenden has written one very, very long sentence, and then a short one, which is a textbook set-up/punchline format if ever I saw one. Get your chuckle boxes round this: \"I was about to write you a sincere email about how fed up I am with the degrading way the women's beach volleyball players (and their bikinis) are always discussed, and how it's a sport these players and their fans take very seriously, and that the comments of retrograde sexists who seem attracted purely to an article of clothing, are demoralising are not only demonstrating the pathetic level of ignorance of most sports spectators (and a fair few journalists) but are really undermining and disrespect the athletes in a way I really don't think they'd appreciate. Then I realised that Brasil's women are wearing tops with 'BRA' across their chests, which isn't really helping my point is it?\" He's here all night.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>2.19am:</strong> \"That's it! That's it!\" The first set in goes to the American duo of Kerri Walsh and Misty May-Treanor. They take it 21-12.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>2.17am:</strong> I have just watched \"the play of the tournament\" in the beach volleyball, which has left me cold for something so magnificent. The Brazilian duo won it, and have got it back to 10-18 in the first game/set/rubber.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>2.15am:</strong> Late-night stalwart Andrew Jolly (for whom it's actually the middle of the day, since he's in Australia) has been totting up what we can hope for from Team GB!GB!GB! for the rest of the games. \"Laser sailing; men's madison; men's individual sprint; women's individual sprint, womens BMX, mountain bike, triple tump, and women's 400m. Have I missed anything?\" Well, there's some horsey stuff, in which we're sometimes good for a bronze, and out men's triathletes have got an outside chance, apparently. That said, our outside chances in the women's event yesterday came 21st and nowhere.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>2.10am: Beach volleyball:</strong> This is the women's semi-finals, by the way, between Brazil and the United States. I'm guessing it's live, in which case the score is 10-5 to USA in the first game, but it might be recorded, in which case .... USA won 2-0.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>2.08am: Beach volleyball:</strong> Straight in and straight into the beach volleyball. I've never gone crazy for this, since I have previously seen bikinis before, and also have access to the internet, where there are all kinds of things to see, so I'm told. Happy that it's on today, though, because it gives me the perfect excuse to quote New Yorker writer Anthony Lane, who said: \"Beach volleyball is to proper volleyball what Elvis's movies are to Elvis's music,\" <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/08/25/080825fa_fact_lane\">among 5,000-odd other words on the Games that I advise you to read</a>.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>1.55am:</strong> Here we go again, here we go-go-go to the temple of consumption. It's day 11 at the Games of the XXIX Olympiad in Beijing, and it's going to be another thriller.</p> <p>Over the previous 10, Her Majesty the Queen has received a huge boost to the drafting of her New Year's honours list, with a 12-gold-medal haul for Team GB. The future MBEs, CBEs, Knights and Dames of our proud nation have surpassed the expectations of even the most jingoistic cab driver. Liu Xiang's Achilles tendon? Who cares. Team GB has biked, sailed, rowed and swum the gold into our souls, and we're loving it.</p> <p>Today, the fun starts with the <strong>men's triathlon</strong> at 3am BST, about an hour from now. Do two outside chances make a genuine chance? Who knows, but son-of-former-football-referee-Philip-Don <strong>Tim Don</strong>, a former World Champion, is going, as is British champion <strong>Will Clarke</strong>, whose father never officiated any top-level football match, unless you know different. Emails are always welcome. <strong>Alistair Brownlee</strong> is also wearing the Team GB colours, but he doesn't have a Wikipedia entry.</p> <p>Much later, <strong>Bradley Wiggins</strong>, <strong>Mark Cavendish</strong>, <strong>Victoria Pendleton</strong> and <strong>Chris Hoy</strong> go in the velodrome, and Paul Goodison is off again in the men's laser (sailing). Bikes and boats=British bounty. On the track, <strong>Christine Ohuruogu</strong> goes in the 400m, and there also some dressage.</p> <p>All kind of other events featuring athletes not from these shores will be grudgingly squeezed into the other 19 hours of this live report. Stick with us.</p> <p>Please share your thoughts by emailing here: <a href=\"mailto:hswains@gmail.com\">hswains@gmail.com</a>, although Aussie-baiting is taking a rest day. (Unless there really is nothing else)</p> <!-- Block 1 --> <p>Howard will be tapping away right here from 1.55am.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Q</strong> We inherited a house last year after the death of my father-in-law. As my wife is an only child this will be the sole inheritance of her lifetime. We put the house on the market in November 2007 but it hasn't sold. The house is in need of some minor repairs and modernisation. We do not want to invest our money in a letting opportunity as my wife grew up in the property and it has strong emotional ties. We have considered making some minor improvements, but estate agents have advised us to sell the property as it is. We are also worried about losing any invested money due to a falling market. Our friends have repeatedly told us to go for auction, but we are unsure if this is the right route for us. After our first estate agent grossly overpriced the property we feel exposed to those who could take advantage of us in the current financial market.</p> <p>The property is costing us in terms of specialist empty property insurance (\u00a3400 a year) and council tax at 50% (\u00a344 a month). Is it worth holding out until we are in a rising market (even though the credit crunch reports seem to point towards a two-year period of bottoming out) or should we cut and run and realise our asset sooner rather that later? We've heard that auctions fetch lower than the market price (currently \u00a3129,000) and can be quite costly in terms of fees.<br><strong>RW</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> If you would rather not have the expense - and possibly the worry - of running an empty property, I would be tempted to sell the house sooner rather than later. I would also be tempted to take the estate agent's advice and sell it in its current state rather than spend money on modernising it. </p> <p>As for selling at auction, the big advantages are certainty and speed. The property goes to the highest bidder and once the hammer falls, he or she is legally obliged to complete the purchase. Unlike selling with an estate agent, the property is not sold subject to contract, which means that completion usually takes place within 28 days of the auction.</p> <p>However, you are right in thinking that selling at auction can be expensive. As well as the typical commission of 2.5% (plus VAT) of the sale price, you would also have to pay the auctioneer's costs of around \u00a31,400 to market the property - whether it sells or not.</p> <p>As a general rule, selling at auction is considered to be most beneficial for property which is out of the ordinary in some way. This can mean it is architecturally unusual and hard to value, or is very run down and in need of major renovation work. If you were to sell your property this way you should choose an auction house offering similar property in the same sort of price range to improve your chances of getting a realistic valuation and a good price.</p> <p>Alternatively, get three different estate agents to give you a valuation. It would also make sense to get their advice on the steps you can take to improve the property's saleability, which don't involve a major financial outlay.</p>"
