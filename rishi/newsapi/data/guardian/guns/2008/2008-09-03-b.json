  "<p>An American poet and playwright who could be savagely critical of his compatriots, Carl Morse, who has died aged 73, had a deep, if no less critical, affection for the British. This was best encapsulated for me by the story he told of seeing a woman in the audience at the end of one of his plays in London, howling inconsolably. Having assured himself that this fit was brought on by his play - and not some personal anguish - Carl determined to return to Britain as often as possible.</p> <p>During the 1980s and 90s, he exercised an important influence on a generation of British gay and lesbian writers and performing artists through his inclusion in anthologies printed by Gay Men's Press, the Oscars Press and Gay Sweatshop; performances of his work at the Oval House Theatre in London; and his co-editing of Gay and Lesbian Poetry in Our Time (1988). A selection of his work in Three New York Poets (1987) introduced his poetry to a British audience. Fruit of Your Loins (1995), which I had the honour of co-publishing, collected some of his most compelling writing for the stage. His plays, like his poetry, were fuelled by rage, leavened by humour and punctuated with a surprise tenderness. </p> <p>Carl grew up in Maine, with a working-class background, then studied English and foreign languages at Yale. His first contact with British writers came during a Fulbright scholarship (1956-58), spent mostly in France. Working with a publishing house back in New York, he was especially proud of his correspondence with EM Forster while editing the first US publication of Forster's Alexandria in 1961. He was also an accomplished translator from French to English and vice versa. His work included a biography of Verlaine, the essays of Andr\u00e9 Maurois, and even the 1961 French version of Snow White.</p> <p>Carl lived for many years at London Terrace, in Chelsea, New York, where he was one of the city's most accommodating hosts and Martini stirrers. His grandness, hilarity and furious resistance to intolerance will be missed. He is survived by his partner, Fred Trump, and the extended family he made for himself.</p>",
  "<p>It's having a busy time, making waves that have been felt all around the mobile and web world \u2014 especially the latter.</p> <p>First up, Android \u2014 a software stack for mobile devices that includes an operating system, middleware and key applications. That's not our description, but Google's. We'd describe Android as Google's attempt to give Linux a pretty face before putting it on to mobile phones as part of the company's ongoing endeavour to conquer the world, perhaps as part of the Doctor Who Christmas special plotline.</p> <p>Google's dastardly plan began in January, when it launched the Android Developer Challenge. This encouraged geeks to devise applications for Android in the hope of winning some cash. Some serious cash: a total of $10m (\u00a35.6m) in prize money was offered. Google gave 50 developer teams $25,000 each just to open their netbooks. Those who made the most \"innovative apps\" would win much, much more.</p> <p>The geeks got to work and, eight months on, <a href=\"http://code.google.com/android/adc_gallery/\">the results</a> are just in: 10 entries each bagged a top prize of $275,000, and 10 more grabbed equal shares of $1m. Where did the remaining millions go? This moolah's been set aside for part two of the challenge, scheduled to begin when the first Android handsets go on sale - which also happens to be about now.</p> <p>What innovative ideas did all this money reward? $275,000 went to CompareEverywhere, a price-comparison service that uses snapshots of product barcodes to look up the most competitive deals online. Another $275,000 went to GoCart, a price-comparison service that uses snapshots of product barcodes to look up the most competitive deals online. Fortunately, most of the remaining 48 finalists innovated beyond barcode-scanning.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Google has been doing some \"innovating\" of its own: it's invented a web browser. <a href=\"http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/09/fresh-take-on-browser.html\">Google Chrome</a>, which was released in beta yesterday, is pitched as a reinvention of the browser. For our money, though, Google's real innovation was to turn a press release into a comic book that supposedly slipped out early. A slip-up that's garnered Google plenty of press for Chrome, naturally.</p> <p>So what is Chrome? Check out the <a href=\"http://www.google.com/googlebooks/chrome/\">cartoon press release</a>, but if you're still lacking time, Google says that Chrome bolsters stability by treating websites not as websites but applications, supposedly ensuring that one sickly site won't cause every other one in your browser to keel over. </p> <p>It's impossible to see the arrival of a browser from Google as anything but a push into the last internet space that it doesn't yet have a foot in - and hence as an elbow in the ribs to Microsoft, which is releasing Internet Explorer 8, as well as Firefox and Mozilla. Existing browsers date back to the 1990s, it says - a subtle dig. Does the future have a chrome finish?</p>",
  "<p>The Republicans last night went to war against what the campaign manager, Rick Davis, yesterday described as \"frenzied scrutiny\" of Sarah Palin by the media as Palin spent a third successive day shuttered in her hotel suite in Minneapolis. She has given only one interview - to People magazine - since being named as John McCain's running mate.</p> <p>During her sequestration, Palin has been coached by senior campaign aides on McCain's policy positions, and has been honing the delivery of her address.</p> <p>Davis told the Washington Post yesterday that the speech prepared for the vice-presidential nominee - evidently before McCain had made his choice - was \"very masculine\". Once Palin got the nod, he said, \"we had to start from scratch\".</p> <p>Other aides said that last night's advice would depart from Palin's introductory speech last week - when she called herself a \"hockey mom\" - and would focus instead on her record as a reform-minded governor of Alaska and as an authority on energy. Until then, it was left to the campaign to beat back critics, and blunt the potential fallout from further revelations about Palin's background and family life.</p> <p>Rudy Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, led the charge yesterday, trying to link his record of governing a city of 8 million with Palin's experience as steward of a town of 8,000. In an interview with CBS, Giuliani argued Palin was more qualified to be president because she had been a governor and run a budget.</p> <p>He added: \"Has anybody ever asked Barack Obama, can you bring up your two kids and be president of the United States? They are asking, 'Can she be vice-president and be a mother?' Come on.\"</p> <p>As scrutiny of Palin intensified, Time magazine reported that as mayor of Wasilla, she had tried to sack a local librarian for refusing to ban certain books.</p> <p>\"The greatest opening we have in this election is that there are many disaffected Democrats who are seriously considering voting for the McCain-Palin ticket,\" Davis said in a conference call yesterday.</p> <p>The campaign is also confident of support from rightwing Republicans, who have abandoned their usual opposition to pre-marital sex to embrace Palin's pregnant daughter Bristol as a heroine to the anti-abortion cause.</p> <p>There was also sensitivity that continued discussion of Palin could damage her image outside the convention hall - even though the Democrats say the controversy was an asset to McCain because it distracted from the ailing economy.</p> <p>\"I guess I don't blame them. Because if you don't have any issues to run on I guess you want it all to be on personality. And if you've got George Bush's track record and John McCain voting 90% of the time in agreement with George Bush then you probably don't want to talk about the issues,\" Obama said during a campaign stop at Kent State University in Ohio.</p> <p>In a brief exchange with the Guardian yesterday, McCain's spokesman, Tucker Bounds, said he would not address any questions about Palin's travel within the US without reference to Obama. \"Before I begin to process your question, will you please let me know how many states Barack Obama had travelled to before he started running for president - and which ones they were,\" he wrote.</p> <p>The testiness even extended to Karl Rove, the mastermind of George Bush's election victories, who had suggested McCain's rationale for choosing Palin was winning the election, and not governing. \"Karl's wrong,\" snapped Steve Schmidt, a senior campaign adviser, on CBS yesterday. \"She's been under vicious assault and attack from the angry left.\"</p>",
  "<p>Court sittings could be cancelled, trials delayed and magistrates even made redundant as a result of a \u00a390m \"black hole\" in the budget of the courts service, according to documents leaked to the Conservatives.</p> <p>The budget crisis is revealed in a letter sent by Lord Justice Leveson, the senior presiding judge for England and Wales, to all judges and magistrates last Friday, warning them that \u00a327m extra savings had to be made by next March, with an urgent action plan to be presented to the justice ministry later this month. </p> <p>Further savings over the next three years to bring the total to \u00a390m need to be made because of a sharp fall in fee income for the courts. The crisis has been triggered by a sharp reduction in cases brought by Revenue &amp; Customs chasing unpaid taxes and a sharp drop in child protection cases after the introduction of full-cost fees in May.</p> <p>\"No part of the HMCS [the courts service] will be protected from having to find savings ... All options are being considered. Regional, central and area directors are reviewing all parts of the business to see where savings can be made ... Some parts of our budget are fixed costs which are difficult to cut (eg rent on buildings) so we have to find savings from parts of the budget where we have control such as salary costs, sitting days, building works and our charge projects,\" says a courts service paper for senior managers enclosed with the Leveson letter.</p> <p>The memo also admits that \"a redundancy scheme ... is something we may have to consider for the future\".</p> <p>The roots of the budget crisis lie in a fall in fee income from civil and family court business since April: \"HM Revenue and Customs, who were our biggest customer, have reduced their use of magistrates' courts to retrieve unpaid taxes,\" it says. \"At the same time, local authorities are taking longer to go to court while the new public law care proceedings bed in. Some local authorities are challenging the validity of the new fees for this work.\"</p> <p>Shadow justice minister Henry Bellingham said: \"Once again, this government's incompetence has led to a crisis in the justice system. If court sittings are cancelled and trials delayed, the public will be put at risk and justice undermined. Ministers ignored warnings from judges, magistrates and local authorities and now they do not have the money to address the shortfall. This is a black hole of their own making.\"</p> <p>The budget crisis has potentially wider implications. When the Ministry of Justice was set up last year, the senior judges warned that spiralling prison costs could jeopardise the independence of the courts unless their budgets were ringfenced.</p> <p>Although court service managers insist that asking the justice ministry or the Treasury to meet the shortfall \"is not an option\", Lord Justice Leveson observes in his letter that extra money was promised if it was needed to cover the fall in fee income from family work as part of the \"concordat\" settling the dispute between the judges and the justice ministry.</p> <p>Under rules introduced in May, local authorities are expected to repay courts for the full cost of child protection proceedings in an attempt to persuade them to resolve cases without going to court.</p>",
  "<p><strong>For as long as I can remember, I have had an overpowering longing for love and a family of my own. I grew up in a dysfunctional household and was an introverted kid, then a troubled teenager. Although I believe I have managed to grow into a pretty decent 35-year-old despite the odds, I still have not got a partner and children.</strong></p> <p><strong>The concept of relationships is alien to me. I have never been in a functional one - I have only been with two men - and it has dawned on me that I have idealised the concept due to my lack of experience, which in turn is the result of my fear of rejection and heartbreak.</strong></p> <p><strong>More to the point, I am terrified of ending up with a man like my father, who is emotionally detached. He drove my mother to extremes, psychologically. I have always been fiercely independent and remain so, but, at the same time, I lack confidence and feel I am an underachiever, despite doing well academically and in some other areas of my life too. Am I wrong in thinking that it is a mistake on my part to want a family when clearly it is not meant to happen? How does one overcome fear and start living life? How can I start believing in myself, so that others will too? </strong></p> <h2>Concentrate on yourself first </h2> <p>My childhood was similar to yours and I, too, felt an overpowering longing for love. However, I decided not to have children and focused on finding a loving relationship. </p> <p>I married late in life and have found the closeness and affection that was lacking in my childhood. I am happier now than I have ever been and have no regrets about not having children. </p> <p>Overcoming my earlier difficulties has been a long and difficult process, and therapy was helpful. I realised that the lack of parental support in childhood had made me very self-contained and incapable of expressing my feelings and needs in the way that normal people do. At your age, I was in so much inner turmoil that I was incapable of really loving another person. </p> <p>Concentrate on your own emotional development first - those of us who struggle to achieve healthy and satisfying relationships are often more appreciative of love when we finally receive it.<br><strong>HS</strong>, Carmarthenshire, Wales</p> <h2>Change your outlook</h2> <p>You still have time on your side. I suggest that you try to think less. Be brazen, selective and assertive about who you want as your partner and potential father for your children. You sound as if you are successful and independent in your professional life, so draw on these strengths in your personal life.</p> <p>I understand that you have hang-ups - I did too, which is why I write to you from the heart and urge you to be proactive in your quest for happiness. Don't resign yourself to a fate you don't want - change your outlook and the way you operate. You need to open up like a flower in bloom!<br><strong>KB</strong>, Wales</p> <h2>Therapy might help you</h2> <p>Have you sought help for your feelings of fear and lack of self-confidence? You may benefit from talking things through with someone. At 29, I have just completed a course of eight sessions (on the NHS) with a cognitive behavioural therapist for help with my own feelings of anxiety and low self-esteem. It has been life-changing. I can't recommend it highly enough as a means of changing how you think about yourself and your future. </p> <p>Furthermore, please don't think that love and a family are \"not meant to be\" for you. Why wouldn't they be? You've come so far in breaking free from your difficult background - don't give up now.<br><strong>CR</strong>, London</p> <h2>Improve your social skills first</h2> <p>You are not wrong in longing for a family or a healthy, loving relationship with a man. </p> <p>But please don't try to have the former without first mastering the latter or you will create a miserable and complicated situation for everyone involved.</p> <p>Improving your social skills will help you to feel more confident and to become a better judge of other people to ensure you make the right choice of partner. Don't overlook powerful tools such as hypnotherapy sessions and neuro-linguistic programming lessons, which can help you to become a fearless new you, ready for a relationship and equipped to handle a family of your own.<br><strong>LS</strong>, London</p> <h2>Examine your motives carefully</h2> <p>At an early age, I decided I wanted to have children, whether or not I found a partner. I came to this realisation after caring for my younger sister, who was born when I was 14. A child is the most wonderful gift, but should you decide to have one, it is your responsibility to provide a loving, caring, functional home. Make sure that you want a child for the right reasons - it sounds as if you want to create a perfect family to make up for what you didn't have as a child, so examine your motives carefully.</p> <p>No one is an expert at relationships: we all struggle with what life throws us, but the important thing to recognise is that you need to get over your fear of what might be, and just live. You know what kind of man your father was, so don't go out with men like him. I didn't want to be with someone like my father, and my partner is nothing like him. Beware of self-fulfilling prophecies and be proactive in getting what you want out of life. </p> <p>Are you a good friend? If you are, that is a great basis on which to become a good parent and partner. <br><strong>T</strong>, Hong Kong</p> <h2>What the expert thinks - Linda Blair </h2> <p>You have told us a great deal about your fears, self-doubt and lack of positive experiences. These are all part of you, but they are not the sum total of what makes you the person you are. Dwelling only on what's holding you back will do just that - hold you back. You say that the concept of relationships is \"alien\" to you, yet you grew up in a family that - whether dysfunctional or not - provided you with a number of relationships and you have also had two partners. I imagine you also have friends and work colleagues. These interactions can all help you to understand more about other people, and allow you to discover what effects other people have on you. If you reflect on your experiences, you will become aware of what it is within each relationship that fulfils you - as well as what causes you distress. It is not the number or type of experiences we have that determines how much we learn - it is whether we make use of them.</p> <p>You also suggest that because you grew up in a dysfunctional household, it is surprising that you are now \"pretty decent\". Yet dreadful experiences are precisely what make some individuals determined to become decent and generous. Finding such life events hurtful, they use them as examples of what not to do. You have done this already, in that you say you don't wish to end up in a relationship with someone like your father.</p> <p>However, those individuals who are most likely to live fulfilling lives despite an unhappy past use that past only as a starting point. They decide what they do want in life, and identify what must be done to realise their dreams. To help them figure out how to behave more adaptively, they look for inspiring role models to provide examples of how to create positive beliefs and how to behave constructively.</p> <p>Look around you. Who has ideals you admire? Who seeks to achieve their dreams, however difficult, and how do they do so? Start changing your own beliefs and behaviours so that they resemble those of your chosen role model more than those you dislike. </p> <p>I doubt that any of these people would articulate a dream and then say that it is \"not meant to happen\".</p> <p>The only way to overcome your fear of living life is through taking action. You can only conquer a fear by defying it - by pushing aside self-doubt and trying. This is also the only way to start believing in yourself, because you can't know for sure what you are capable of until you put yourself to the test.</p> <p>You already know how you don't want to live, and what you do want. Now you must start trying to achieve your aspirations. Start small. What can you do today that will be a step in the right direction? Of course, you will make mistakes - everyone does. However, the only people who realise their dreams are those who learn from their mistakes when they \"fail\", adjust their beliefs and behaviours accordingly, and then try again, and again, and again. They truly \"live life\" and end up believing in themselves.</p> <h2>Next week: Should I return to the wife I left? </h2> <p>Five years ago I had an affair and, as a result, I left my marriage of 15 years. After all this time, my wife and I have come through the pain of our respective feelings of betrayal and loss. We have also stopped fighting over access to our four children and money; we conduct our relationship on a fairly congenial basis, but rarely stray into emotional territory. Before the affair, our marriage was seemingly safe and secure, although it could not be described as sexually or emotionally rich; it was more akin to a much-loved cardigan than a flashy new top. The affair became a very loving and highly sexual relationship for me, but stuttered to an end this year, because I could not psychologically move on from the family I had left behind. Now my wife has told me that she still loves me and wants me to come home. </p> <p>We are both struggling financially and it seems the most practical thing to do. </p> <p>However, when we talk, I am only partially listening; the other part of me is thinking, \"I admire and respect you, and feel responsible for you but I feel nothing more for you than that.\" In two years, our eldest child will leave for university and within five years the others will also have left home, so there would be just the two of us living together.</p> <p>Should I go home, as I have failed to create a happy alternative and put on the cardigan again - even if it is not as loved as it once was?</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 Private Lives </strong>appears every Thursday.

  "<p>Gerard Butler is standing at the window with his back to me, aiming a gun. His tree-trunk legs are spread wide. His biceps are stretching his cashmere jersey, his deltoids flexing like a pair of dolphins trying to nibble his ears. Testosterone oozes across the room.</p> <p>From this angle, Butler is quite something. You feel an instant sympathy with the 1,589 members of the Facebook group Gerard Butler Is My Husband - He Just Doesn't Know It Yet. Likewise the 800-odd who signed up to Gerard Butler Can Impregnate By Touch Alone, and Gerard Butler Can Make Even Physical Deformity Sexy (presumably a reference to his role in the film Phantom of the Opera). </p> <p>And then he turns round. He's not holding a gun, just squeezing his fingers round an imaginary one. And his target out there? A really nasty piece of work - got to be. After all, the hulk who has played Attila the Hun and Beowulf, and who led 300 highly oiled Spartans into battle wearing just a cape and a leather codpiece, is hardly going to waste his wrath on small fry, is he? Grendel, is it? The Persian hordes? Actually, there's one solitary and rather damp paparazzo loitering on the street below. \"God damn, I hate those people,\" growls Butler, returning to the sofa and cracking open a Coke.</p> <p>So much of Butler's fame is based on his beefcake physique - that rippling 10-pack, that big stubbly head - but the menace that bubbles up in him on screen just isn't present in real life. Not, at least, from the front. He seems, if anything, a bit lost. Half his time, he says, is spent \"trying to maintain a good attitude\" by way of \"meditation, conversation and spending 10 minutes a day with nature\".</p> <p>Unlikely things torment him. Gratuitous violence on film leaves him feeling \"hollow inside\". \"It's like when you're having a steak and you suddenly feel nauseous,\" he says. \"You think, 'This is something dead, and I'm putting it inside me.'\" Yikes. Anyway, the queasy carnivore, the reluctant action hero, is here today to promote RocknRolla, Guy Ritchie's latest geezer flick, in which he stars as One Two, a twinkle-eyed thug who gets in over his head with an old-school London mobster, played by Tom Wilkinson. Butler's giving the promo his best shot. Indeed, he's slightly overegging it. Guy, he says, is a \"genius\". Acting with the ensemble was fabulous. \"Sometimes you pinch yourself and think, 'Fucking hell, I'm working with Thandie Newton!'\"</p> <p>Despite the iffy early reviews, he's keen on the film because, he says, it gives him the chance to show off his range. Although there's something a bit improbable about the idea of a Ritchie film doing that for anybody, he does have a point. \"One Two is more multi-faceted than the parts I've played before,\" he says. \"He can be tough, but he can also be clumsy, vain, self-conscious and silly.\" It is in many ways the perfect Butler part: a hard man with a soft centre, rough-edged but still sweet enough to accommodate the gay advances of a mate.</p> <p>A winning Scottishness is crucial to Butler's appeal, particularly across the pond. The film 300 was, in the end, a kind of Greco-Braveheart. His King Leonidas gave his orders in fluent tartan, without any incongruity being felt by audiences. In the US, clearly, they associate the accent with sword-waving warriors rather than with Rab C Nesbitt. \"In Scotland I'm just like a lot of other guys,\" he says, \"but in America I'm seen as a very strong, masculine guy.\"</p> <p>Does he think there's a difference between what makes a man a man in LA and in Glasgow? He's thoughtful. \"In Glasgow, you probably grow up faster. You have to deal with more shit, more realism. In LA, it's a superficial, perfect world. In Glasgow, you're expected to be a man - but it doesn't make you the perfect man. It makes you a man who's not able to talk about his feelings.\"</p> <p>Butler was raised by his mother after she and his father separated, the latter choosing to remain in Montreal, where Butler lived for the first two years of his life. He didn't have any further contact with his father until he was 16, when the two met up in a cafe. Butler found himself tongue-tied, and returned home to cry solidly for three hours. The pair became close, until his father died of cancer when Butler was 22.</p> <p>He studied law at Glasgow University, won a traineeship in Edinburgh, but didn't much like it, preferring to hit the bottle with his pals (he was especially keen on jumping in front of moving cars and smashing bottles on his head). At 28, he quit booze for good, and then found himself fired from the law firm. So he came to London, took some odd jobs, drifted around. One day Steven Berkoff approached him in a cafe and asked if he'd ever considered acting, offering him a part in Coriolanus. Film work followed: a bit part in Mrs Brown, then Dracula, Attila, Tomb Raider: Cradle of Life and 300. These hard-men roles were interspersed with slush, such as Dear Frankie, in which he plays a dreamy father substitute to Emily Mortimer's deaf-mute son.</p> <p>And now RocknRolla. Butler gives an assured performance, but it's a flashy, trashy movie that's unlikely to do much for his career. Butler has, perhaps, reached something of a plateau. For all that carefully maintained physique, he's not getting any younger and appears to be wrestling with an identity crisis. He seems genuinely stumped when I ask who his role models are, and where he sees himself in five years - hardly ambush questions, but he doesn't have answers. He says something vague about accepting his career, going on a spiritual journey, and that he's in no hurry to have children. He lives alone in New York but has been linked to a number of women, Naomi Campbell and Cameron Diaz included, but no one for long.</p> <p>Is he lonely? \"I definitely have my moments. It's a Scottish thing, the Celtic fog. I am prone to getting inside my head too much. I feel it quite heavily from time to time. In this job, there's more chance for that. Not all the time, just 95%. It's like: please don't leave me alone.\" Perhaps it is this vulnerability that gets to his fans: the hard man with the lost boy deep inside. The extraordinary outpourings on the net (other Facebook groups include Please Have Your Way With My Naked Body Gerard Butler, and Gerard I Want to Touch Your Butler) do seem to be responding to more than just the torso.</p> <p>Maybe he's too introspective, he says at one point. \"I grew up in a very working-class part of Glasgow,\" he adds. \"Then I worked for a very well-to-do law firm in Edinburgh. Then I was an actor in London. Now I'm between New York and LA. I've lived in so many places it's sometimes confusing as to who I am\". </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 RocknRolla</strong> is out tomorrow.</p>",
  "<p>I will not be the only person who reacted with amusement to the news that HarperCollins has just launched a website that encourages would-be authors to upload sample chapters, which will then be judged not by professional editors, but by readers. Amusement at the company's chutzpah, specifically - but amusement tempered with some sympathy, too.</p> <p>In the mid-90s I did a five-month internship in New York at a magazine that published both long-form reportage and fiction. Mostly this meant that very American pastime of rigorous fact-checking (I will never forget calling up the bemused manager of the KFC in Giza and asking him to measure out the exact distance, in yards, between his establishment and the Sphinx's nose) - but it also meant responsibility for reading the manuscripts sent in by hopeful writers, aka the slush pile. There were four of us unpaid minions, and whenever the pile got so high it wouldn't stay up of its own accord we'd retire to the boardroom, divide the orange envelopes between us, and set to work. </p> <p>It is a dispiriting business. Like everyone who has ever done this, we began in great hope. We would discover the next Tom Wolfe, the next John Cheever ... but reality quickly set in. The vast majority of it is just bad. You start doubting your own judgment (particularly when the stuff that you do pass on to senior editors gets ignored, or immediately rejected), get distracted by prisoners who think it a good idea to include a picture of themselves with a gun pointed at the viewer (true story), and quite quickly find yourself reading the first two paragraphs, putting a pencil mark or something on page six (so the outraged author doesn't post it back with a note pointing out that they can tell you haven't read it), and slipping it into an SAE. Not without a mounting sense of guilt. </p> <p>I was very glad when I went on to be an editor and the next set of dewy-eyed interns took over. </p> <p>The slush pile is the great awkward albatross of the publishing industry. Writing must come from someone, and go to somewhere, and not everyone has a friend whose boyfriend happens to be editor of a literary imprint: every day someone decides that there's nothing for it but to post their precious manuscript to someone they've never met, at a company that is receiving stuff from people like them all the time. And even in the best-case scenario - where every word of every submission is read - it is a deeply fallible system. Publishing history teems with stories of missed opportunities. Last year, for example, researchers rooting through 50 years of Knopf archives discovered readers' reports rejecting Anne Frank's diary (\"A dreary record of typical family bickering, petty annoyances and adolescent emotion\"), Borges (\"utterly untranslatable\") and Sylvia Plath (\"There certainly isn't enough genuine talent for us to take notice\"). There will have been a dozen editors - one for every publishing house that rejected him - who kicked themselves when DBC Pierre won the Booker prize in 2003. </p> <p>And it is not, generally, a best-case scenario. While there are advantages for a publisher to going through slush piles - ideally finding the next Roth, or, more realistically, circumventing agents' fees - there are also great disadvantages, not least of which are the hours and hours of labour for very little return. Most big publishers would far rather let an agent do the legwork, and pay the percentage, hence notes on websites like this one, for Faber: \"We no longer accept or engage in communication about any fiction, non-fiction, plays, screenplays or books for children.\"</p> <p>Which doesn't mean the most determined take any notice. Hamish Hamilton, an imprint of Penguin, for example, gets four or so a week - despite a note on the website that declares \"Sadly, we're unable to consider unsolicited manuscripts. The best way to find a publisher is through an agent.\" These four are given to people in the office for a week or two on work experience; if they think there's any merit in the submission, it goes to publishing director Simon Prosser or one of his permanent colleagues. Yet nothing in the past 10 years has actually ended up in print that way. The only books that have been published and not arrived via an agent were recommended by friends in the publishing industry, or by Hamish Hamilton's writers, \"which is slightly different, because there is some connection,\" says Prosser. He has recently established an online magazine called Five Dials, and hopes to receive news of more unexpected (but higher-quality) writers that way. </p> <p>Yet Prosser started out reading slush piles. \"When you're a very junior editor and trying to build up a list and the agents don't know you very well, that's absolutely something you have to do. In most cases the probability [of finding something good] is very low, unless you've got a particular talent for it.\"</p> <p>What applies to junior editors applies to small, independent publishers too, and one outfit that has shown a particular talent for finding good books in the slush pile is the Tindal Street Press, based in Birmingham. No one had really heard of the firm until it beat Martin Amis and JM Coetzee to the Booker shortlist in 2003, with Clare Morrall's Astonishing Splashes of Colour. Morrall had been rejected by 33 publishers before she resorted to sending her book to publishers unsolicited. \"Because we're small and we've been building a reputation, we haven't been an obvious choice for agents,\" says editor Luke Brown, \"so the slush pile has been vital for us.\" This year Tindal Street is publishing three novels that began life this way. Brown admits, however, that this kind of publishing is extremely labour-intensive: not only do you have to find the book - you then have to make it publishable. </p> <p>\"We work a lot with the authors,\" says Brown. \"Generally there are four or five drafts. It's a question of seeing its potential.\" The process can take up to three years, and there are few big publishers, mindful of corporate owners and bottom lines, willing to give this kind of time to an off-chance.</p> <p>These days, the task of first sifter generally goes to agents - but even they are feeling overwhelmed. Curtis Brown proclaims on its website, as a point of difference: \"We are one of the few agencies who do accept unsolicited manuscripts.\" Anyone who begins to feel this publishing business is a closed shop has good reason. </p> <p>But there are other ways to get a hearing. There is the Literary Consultancy, for example, established by Hannah Griffiths and Rebecca Swift in 1996, at a time when many independent publishers were being gobbled up by conglomerates. They began to see, as Swift puts it, that \"bottom lines had become all-important, meaning that writers who were perhaps too literary or too experimental are judged with extreme caution by anyone interested in profits first.\" </p> <p>In the slush pile Swift saw not guilt-inducing dross, but \"a great big neglected pile of people's efforts. Everybody needed and deserved attention.\" But at the same time, \"what they needed to understand was that that was very highly skilled attention, and that to get a really good response should cost money.\" They charge \u00a375 to read stories of up to 3,000 words; \u00a3250 for a one-or two-page synopsis up to 100 double-spaced pages; \u00a31.50 per double-spaced page for the first 300 pages of a longer manuscript, and \u00a31 per page thereafter, providing for that a detailed, thoughtful critique of the entire submission. If they consider a work exceptional, they will recommend it to an agent. They are doing well. </p> <p>The internet, of course, means that more and more people publish straight on to the web, either as is, or to get peers to comment on it. Ten years ago Hamish Hamilton was getting 20 manuscripts a week rather than four, and Prosser puts this decrease down not just to active discouragement, but also the ways in which writers are learning to circumvent the traditional machine. \"I do think there's been an opening up,\" says Swift. \"A lot of writers are taking things into their own hands and publishing online. </p> <p>I think sending things in blind now is about the most stupid thing you can do.\"</p> <p>Given that context, Swift argues, and the sheer amount of writing, HarperCollins's new venture seems less an abdication of responsibility than an attempt to keep up. It remains to be seen how much it will achieve. \"They'll probably find a couple of good writers a year,\" Swift says. \"But I think to leave it completely to peer management might be fantastically chaotic.\" </p> <p>No less chaotic, some would argue, than taking pot luck with a student on work experience, or an overworked editor who might be having an off day. Publishing is, in the end, a triumph of hope over logistics. There will always be someone hoping to be like first novelist Rawi Hage, picked off a slush pile at Anansi Books in Canada to win the world's most lucrative literary prize, the \u00a380,000 Dublin Impac Literary Award; or Nobel prize winner William Golding, rejected by 20 publishers then picked off the slush pile by Charles Monteith at Faber; or JK Rowling, picked out of the post by office manager Bryony Evens, even though she knew the agent she worked for didn't publish children's books. And they will keep trying anyway, chaos be damned.</p>",
  "<p>A first world war sailor's engagement ring, discovered on the seabed almost 90 years after he died, was donated to a museum by his nephew yesterday.</p> <p>Stanley Cubiss was one of 188 crewmen who died on January 12 1918, after two warships ran aground on the Orkney island of South Ronaldsay.</p> <p>Cubiss's ring was found on the seabed by diver Peter Brady last summer while he was exploring the waters around Orkney. He and his diving partner, Bob Hamilton, traced Cubiss's nephew, Malcolm Cubiss, and gave the ring to him.</p> <p>Malcolm Cubiss, a retired brigadier, said: \"I was amazed first of all that they managed to find something like that in the sea, and secondly that they tracked me down from an inscription on the ring.\"</p> <p>The inscription inside the ring reads: \"To Stanley from Flo, 6 March 1916.\" </p> <p>Cubiss has now donated the ring, along with other photos and medals, to Scapa Flow visitor centre on the island of Hoy. \"I am now 79 years old, and if I had kept this ring, which was very kindly offered to me, I would have only put it in a drawer, and in time it would have been thrown out or sold,\" he said.</p> <p>\"I had one or two other pieces, medals and photos and other things, and it struck me that if there is a museum there, then that would be a much more appropriate place for them.\"</p> <p>The ring and artefacts were handed over by the divers during a small ceremony at the centre yesterday. They will join other pieces related to the first world war disaster in which the two ships, HMS Opal and HMS Narborough, ran aground on Orkney in a snowstorm.</p> <p>Janette Park of Orkney Museums said she was thrilled by the find. \"Up to now we had a lifebelt and a gun off the Opal. These artefacts complement the naval displays we have by showing the social history and the personal side of the sailors' lives.\"</p>",
  "<p>Harriet Harman will today step up her drive to make buying sex illegal when she releases new figures showing that more than half of men and women support the move if it will reduce people-trafficking for sexual exploitation. </p> <p>Labour's deputy leader, the minister for women and equality, will also highlight cultural double standards after some respondents, particularly older men, condoned buying sex but condemned those who sell it. </p> <p>A Home Office-led review into the demand for prostitution, due to report this year, is looking at whether ministers should make it illegal to pay for sex. The review is looking at a range of options to curb demand, but the Home Office minister, Vernon Coaker, has given a broad hint he will back criminalising the purchase of sex if there is a sign of a national consensus on the issue. </p> <p>The findings of the government-commissioned survey are likely to give ministers greater confidence in introducing the measure. At present the law makes it illegal to sell sex, but ministers including Coaker have visited Sweden to see if tougher laws, including banning the purchase of sex, can work.</p> <p>Harman has the backing of a number of prominent ministers, including the solicitor general, Vera Baird, and the attorney general, Lady Scotland. </p> <p>Harman claimed some people in the survey showed \"double standards\", indicating that they were relaxed about the principle of paying for sex but would be deeply ashamed if a female relative was working as a prostitute. </p> <p>The Ipsos-Mori poll, conducted in July and August, showed that more than half of men and women (58%) support making it illegal to pay for sex if it will help reduce the numbers of women and children being trafficked into the UK for sexual exploitation. </p> <p>The research also found divergent attitudes between women and men. A clear majority of women found both paying for sex and selling it unacceptable (61% and 65% respectively), but men were much more equivocal, with just 42% and 40% respectively finding it unacceptable.</p> <p>More than half of those questioned (60%) from both genders would feel ashamed if they found out a family member was working as a prostitute. But men were more likely to find it unacceptable for a female relative to sell sex, while being relaxed about a male relative paying for it. </p> <p>This difference was most stark among men over 55, who were the most accepting of buying sex in general, but just 21% of whom thought it acceptable for a female relative to sell sex.</p> <p>Young people were more likely than older people to find paying for sex and selling sex unacceptable (64% and 69% respectively). </p> <p>Harman said: \"Our survey suggests that there are double standards out there: the overwhelming majority of those people who said they thought selling sex was a reasonable choice also said they would find it unacceptable if a family member was working as a prostitute. </p> <p>\"While the majority of men and women agree that paying for sex should be made illegal if it will help stop the trafficking of women for sexual exploitation, women and young people are much more likely to find the whole idea of paying for sex unacceptable. We know that paying for sex fuels the demand for trafficked women and children, but we can't talk about tackling demand without challenging cultural attitudes more widely.\"</p> <p>Harman has been allowed to express her personal view that buying sex should be made illegal before the government review has been completed.</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama's Irish ancestry barely rates a mention as he tells his American story, but the roots, if genealogists are to be believed, run deep. His great-great-great-grandfather on his mother's side fled Ireland and the Great Famine at the age of 19. As a senator in Chicago, he has been careful to maintain a visible interest in Ireland, and yesterday reports emerged suggesting that O'Bama, as some style him, may yet create an advisory group on Ireland, led by five top senators. He looks great in green.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Many there would rejoice if the Democrat prevails in November, but the omens would be less good for Tim Spicer, the private military contractor whose company, Aegis Defence Services, has been living large on the basis of a $293m security contract from the Pentagon, making it the biggest private military outfit in Iraq. Of course, we know Spicer for other things too. There was the arms-to-Africa saga of the late 1990s - when his previous firm, Sandline, shipped weapons to a Sierra Leone militia leader - and also some shenanigans in Papua New Guinea. He was also, during his eventful time in the British army, the commanding officer of two Scots Guards convicted of murdering Catholic teenager Peter McBride in north Belfast in 1992. Barack Obama, way back in 2005, wrote to a constituent voicing distaste for Spicer, and the letter has since been given a fresh airing by the Pat Finucane Centre, the civil rights group in Belfast. \"Given his history, I agree that the United States should consider rescinding its contract with his company,\" Obama wrote. And they won't let him forget it.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>The game's up. The signs are unmistakable. With 18 months to go until the expiry of Sir Ian Blair's contract as commissioner of the Metropolitan police, he'll soon hear whether he can expect a renewal. The hope is slim, but Slim left town. High noon indeed. The challenge is to find anyone who believes that Sir Ian will get an extension. The Tories are coming, and they don't like him, but neither would he receive sufficient support from Labour. The continuing unease about the shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes has weakened him immeasurably, as has dissension within the senior ranks - not to mention the investigation into his longstanding friendship with a well-paid Met contractor. Dark days ahead. And long nights.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Yes, the news is bad at present, and the latest setback concerns suggestions that Andy Hayman, the former head of the anti-terrorist squad, may weave tales of his difficulties at the Met and of the deterioration of his relationship with Sir Ian into a troublesome new book. Little wonder, then, that the powers are assessing the alternatives. Paul Stephenson, Sir Ian's deputy, seems a possibility, as does Hugh Orde, chief constable in Northern Ireland, and Norman Bettison, the top man in West Yorkshire. Bettison has issues, having lost a legal battle last year to fatten up his pension, but some still say he could bring calm after the turbulence of the Blair years. It's all relative.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Ken Livingstone has spoken out on Sir Ian's behalf, but then Ken speaks out on many things. At the weekend, in the Telegraph, the subject was his underpants. \"When I packed to go to Shanghai and Beijing to open the London Olympic bid's offices, I hadn't been aware that as I packed my underpants one of the kids had unpacked them, so I arrived in Beijing and realised that I'd got no pants,\" he told the paper. \"I went to the Chinese equivalent of M&amp;S.\" Size became an issue. \"In England I'm a large, but they just had XXL, so I thought, 'I won't fit in those.' Then I realised that because of the problem of western obesity, the largest size of underpants in China would just about pass as a UK large. Their XXL is our large.\" Amazing.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>\"It hasn't caused me any trouble at all, quite the opposite. It has made me world famous,\" said Giles Coren, of his crazy, sweary memo to subeditors at the Times. \"My dear, you wouldn't be talking to me now or trying to interview me if not for those emails.\" But that's him.

  "<p>An \u00a385m redevelopment of Connaught Place, the historic commercial centre designed for imperial Delhi by the British Raj architect Robert Tor Russel, has run into a storm of criticism just as the first phase has been completed.</p> <p>The restoration of the first of Connaught Place's colonnaded neo-Paladian buildings was completed in August under the urban renewal project, which is due to be finished by July 2010. But the work has faced criticism from conservation architects as well as local traders. </p> <p>On the architectural front, experts from the Delhi Urban Arts Commission discovered flaws, including misaligned decorative plaster and badly designed flooring, when they inspected the buildings. Workers are now correcting the mistakes. </p> <p>The traders support the restoration but do not want the area to be converted into a pedestrian promenade and leisure hub. They were not consulted about the project and have now hired a conservation architect and petitioned Delhi's lieutenant governor for their cause. </p> <p>\"Connaught Place has always been a commercial complex, so the municipality cannot change the historic character of the area and make it into a leisure centre,\" said the conservation architect AGK Menon. </p> <p>Inspired by Rome's Coliseum and shaped like a horseshoe (to bring luck to all, it was said), providence has been particularly unkind to Delhi's commercial hub. Among all the grand structures of a unique garden city that has come to be known as Lutyens' Delhi, after its master architect, Edwin Lutyens, the two concentric rings of Connaught Place's buildings, housing shops below and offices and residences above, have been the most ill-fated. </p> <p>After the British left, draconian rent control laws, neglect by the municipal authorities, and the installation of an underground market at the tree-lined, 13-acre Connaught Circus, turned the once elegant site into a seedy, dilapidated eyesore. Even shoppers stayed away. </p> <p>\"It is only a question of time before the last vestiges of neo-Palladian architecture and imperial building are lost beneath cheap restaurants and new office blocks,\" Andreas Volwahsen, an architectural historian, lamented in 2002.</p> <p>\"Sadly, a town is being deprived of its most important economic foundations.\" </p> <p>However, three years later the opening of a Delhi Metro station under the Circus brought in many more visitors. Refurbished cinemas, stylish restaurants and stores have added to the bustle and glitz. </p> <p>The restoration of the area, officially renamed after Indira and Rajiv Gandhi but still mostly known as Connaught Place, is due to be completed in time for the Commonwealth games, in two years' time. </p> <p>However, none of the historic buildings of Lutyens' Delhi, including the presidential palace, circular parliament and grand north and south block secretariats, are listed. Legally, these buildings can be torn down and replaced, as has happened to a few places in the Connaught Place precinct. The only protection comes from a general no-development rule in the Lutyens' zone. But the municipality has delayed producing a heritage building list, allegedly influenced by lobbying. </p> <p>Developers are also trying to get the protected area of Lutyens' Delhi drastically reduced to permit unhindered commercial development. </p> <p>\"Lutyens' Delhi is a unique historical district which occupies less than 2% of the national capital's land, yet developers have been allowed to nibble away at its edges,\" said Menon, who added that there were plans to lobby Unesco for recognition of Delhi as a World Heritage City.</p>",

Kendrick, based at Warminster in Wiltshire, admitted negligently discharging an L96 sniper rifle. A court martial at Bulford, Wilts, took two hours to find him guilty.

  "<p>In 1983, the Sony Corporation of Japan launched a device on a largely unsuspecting world. The Sony Betamovie became the world's first commercial camcorder, using videotape, not film. Despite retailing at around \u00a31,200 - then around the cost of a decent second-hand car - the Betamovie camera helped usher in one of the most defining and disruptive cultural activities of the 1980s: the home video.</p> <p>Fast forward to the present day and the descendants of the Betamovie are far lighter and unimaginably cheaper than those sold in the 1980s. The online retailer Firebox is selling the <a href=\"http://www.firebox.com/product/2160/Busbi-Digital-Video-Camera\">Busbi video camera</a> - which, at \u00a334.95, is perhaps the most basic camcorder ever released. Yet despite being 40 times cheaper than the original Sony Betamovie, it's not a device to sneer at. The quality may be poor when compared to that of more expensive devices, but the Busbi is more than adequate if the intent is to share the results on one of the most defining and disruptive activities of today: YouTube. <br><strong><br>Flipping simple</strong></p> <p>The Busbi is one of a growing number of pocket camcorders, a new category of low-budget, shoot-and-share video cameras. In the US pocket camcorders have caught on as quickly as the iPod once did; indeed, they have much in common with the bestselling digital music player. Another basic camera, the Flip, offers a similar silhouette to the iPod and roughly the same level of simplicity. Even so, despite their sales success, the diminutive cameras have also polarised popular opinion: some love their ease-of-use and low cost, while others see only a clunky and primitive device on the shelf before them. </p> <p>Despite the low cost of the Busbi, the nascent pocket camcorder market has been cornered by the Flip Ultra. According to David Pogue, technology reviewer at the New York Times, the Flip has single-handedly changed an entire industry. Since its launch last May, it has captured more than 14% of the US camcorder market, selling more than 1m - and most of those have gone to women. </p> <p>The Flip, which costs \u00a399, is an astonishingly simple piece of technology. You take it out of the box, switch it on, press the red button to start shooting and that's basically it. The Flip, moreover, stores an hour of video, runs off a pair of AA batteries and needs neither cable nor chargers to maintain it. When you want to upload, you flick a switch and a USB arm flips out (hence the name) allowing you to upload everything to a computer in a couple of clicks. The software is held on the device and is automatically linked to social networking sites including MySpace and YouTube.</p> <p>Pure Digital, the manufacturer of the Flip, has already announced a sister product called the Mino, 40% smaller than the Ultra, which will be in UK shops in time for Christmas. Furthermore, the Flip's success has led to several other pocket camcorders to follow. The most notable among them is Kodak's Zi6, a pocket camcorder capable of taking high-definition video, which will sell for just $180 when it launches later this year. </p> <p>It was photography giant Kodak that launched the second consumer camcorder, the KodaVision 2000 in 1984, but failed to capitalise on its position as the world's largest supplier of processed film. In 2001, it tried again with the launch of the MC3, a hybrid video and MP3 player, but it bombed, adding to the woes of the troubled corporation that has struggled with the conversion from analogue to digital technology.</p> <p>\"I think the MC3 was ahead of its time,\" says Andrei Andrievsky, a product manager at Kodak. \"None of the videoblogging infrastructure that exists today was available back then. Teenagers are on YouTube several times a day. They are using video for self-expression and social connectivity [in a way] that was not there many years ago.\"</p> <p>So how can manufacturers sell camcorders that now cost less than a decent pair of jeans? Says Andrievsky: \"The price point came available very recently, as the cost of components has fallen.\" It's the same reason, he says, that mobile phone companies can offer video recording capabilities on their handsets. Even so, despite the falling costs, Andrievsky says that the Zi6 is not competing with the \"serious\" camcorder market. \"If someone wants to videotape a wedding or the birth of a child, I would not recommend the Zi6,\" he admits. </p> <p>With the price of camcorders falling so dramatically, the big question is: how low can they go? It's telling, perhaps, to learn that Jonathan Kaplan, the Flip's founder, originally envisioned the Flip as a disposable single-shot camcorder. RCA's Small Wonder - the original pocket camcorder - now retails in the US for around $90, and you can buy a Busbi online for \u00a329.99 at Amazon. Few expect the cost of the devices to rise. </p> <p><strong>Snapped up</strong></p> <p>Meanwhile, the cost of traditional camcorders is falling just as swiftly. According to retail analysts GFK, the average price of a camcorder is \u00a3262. \"The average price keeps falling,\" says Nigel Caplow, a consumer electronics expert at GFK. \"Last year the total number of units sold in the UK rose from 850,000 to 877,000, but the value of those units fell from \u00a3243m to \u00a3229m.\" That value, he says, would have fallen further if it were not for the introduction of more expensive high-definition cameras, which have an average price of \u00a3600. </p> <p>When the Betamovie was released in 1983 it was a defining product of its time: hardware-driven, technically challenging and expensively produced in Japan. Pocket camcorders similarly capture the mood of today: software-driven, technically simple to operate and cheaply produced in China.</p>",
  "<p>The Republicans set up a firewall around Sarah Palin yesterday, in a concerted attempt ahead of her debut to choke off or deflect questions about her experience.</p> <p>Last night she was making her first appearance at the Republican convention and her first before a national TV audience, after being embraced by the party's social conservative wing, and injecting much-needed enthusiasm into their support for candidate John McCain.</p> <p>However, in a sign Republicans are nervous at his decision to make the unknown governor of Alaska his running mate, party operatives began an aggressive defence of the vice-presidential candidate.</p> <p>A TV campaign ad released yesterday set out to build a case she is a more effective agent of change than Democratic nominee Barack Obama.</p> <p>The campaign said it would not answer questions on McCain's decision-making process before settling on Palin. It also lined up party leaders to talk up her achievements and to dismiss as sexist any criticism of her experience or lack of it.</p> <p>An angry McCain cancelled an interview with CNN after an on-air clash between an interviewer and a press spokesman over Palin's foreign policy experience. There was also a parallel effort to squash discussion of her family life, including that of her pregnant daughter Bristol, 17.</p> <p>The entire Palin family was lined up on the tarmac at Minneapolis airport to greet McCain's arrival yesterday, including Bristol and her boyfriend, Levi Johnston. McCain made a point of chatting to the couple and gripping Johnston's arm. Aside from this, and a walkaround on the convention stage earlier, Palin was in hibernation - leaving it to her fellow Republicans to rally to her defence.</p> <p>Officially, the campaign is convinced she will appeal to centrist voters - especially women. But that brave front was undermined by a video which surfaced yesterday of an off-air chat between top Republican strategists Mike Murphy and Peggy Noonan, in which they said \"cynicism\" and \"political bullshit\" drove McCain to choose Palin.</p> <p>Earlier, Republican campaign manager, Rick Davis spoke of \"frenzied scrutiny\" of Palin by the media as she spent a third successive day in her hotel suite. She has given only one interview - to People magazine - since being named as McCain's running mate. During her sequestration, Palin has been coached by senior campaign aides on McCain's policy positions, and honed the delivery of her address.</p> <p>Davis told the Washington Post that a speech already prepared, evidently before McCain made his choice of a woman, had been \"very masculine\", and \"we had to start from scratch\" to write one for her.</p> <p>Other aides said last night's advice to her would depart from the manner of Palin's introductory speech last week - when she called herself a \"hockey mom\" - and focus instead on her record as a reform-minded governor and an authority on energy. Until then, it was left to the campaign to beat blunt fallout from further revelations about Palin's background and family life.</p> <p>Rudy Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, led the charge yesterday, trying to link his record of governing a city of 8m with Palin's experience as steward of a town of 8,000. In an interview with CBS, Giuliani argued Palin was more qualified to be president because she had been a governor and run a budget.</p> <p>He added: \"Has anybody ever asked Barack Obama, can you bring up your two kids and be president of the United States? They are asking, 'Can she be vice-president and be a mother?' Come on.\"</p>",
  "<p>Job interviews at West Ham and, most likely, Newcastle United must henceforth take on a new form. Candidates will have to be asked how they propose to cope with diminished funds. Intelligence and talent would make Slaven Bilic an outstanding choice at Upton Park but, at the moment, it is also apt that, as coach of Croatia, he has never been in a position to sign a player. There are going to be fewer sprees in the Premier League.</p> <p>It is as well that the Abu Dhabi United Group is too rich to have commercial inhibitions, because Manchester City may be obliged to stir up most of the Premier League's excitement when it comes to acquiring footballers. Not even the Champions League clubs can be depended on for extravagance. At Arsenal, the habitually frugal Ars\u00e8ne Wenger broke even this summer and Liverpool's Rafael Ben\u00edtez was second-guessed by proprietors who recoiled from the \u00a318m price put on Gareth Barry by Aston Villa.</p> <p>Alan Curbishley must have spotted the trend, but he still felt moved to resign at West Ham in protest at the sale of players. The club assert that there was little option but to transfer Anton Ferdinand after he had declined a new contract. That, however, begs the question of why a person who had expressed a desire to stay in the London area would depart for Sunderland. The terms must have been much more appealing there.</p> <p>Roy Keane is lucky to have been on the loose with a cheque book. Funds have not dried up and Aston Villa, for instance, embarked on squad development, but there is a tone of encroaching austerity. Tottenham Hotspur, for instance, were comfortably in the black by the time the transfer window closed. It is even feasible that Roman Abramovich is cultivating a taste for good housekeeping.</p> <p>There was an emphasis on the fact that he had been outbid for the first time when City snatched Robinho for \u00a332.5m. Though opportunities to jeer at billionaires are scarce and must be cherished, there was a quietly interesting aspect to the affair. The Russian could easily have tossed in an extra \u00a36m to match the Eastlands bid. Might it not be that this, too, was another first for the oligarch as he preferred not to pay more than the player is worth?</p> <p>If even Abramovich has contracted a sense of proportion then it was inevitable that a truly hard line would be taken in other boardrooms. There are owners who can barely comprehend the stance they used to take. Euphoric at the purchase of the club, West Ham's owner, Bjorgolfur Gudmundsson, sanctioned an outlay of about \u00a350m over two transfer windows in 2007 to rebuild the squad. Such a splurge had not achieved much more than to make top-flight status secure. Huge amounts have been expended at clubs who have either never been in the elite or had that status in a bygone era. The Icelander may be discouraged, but Mike Ashley's introduction to reality was far more traumatic.</p> <p>He probably concedes that he has himself to blame since he admits that he did not conduct due diligence before spending \u00a3134m to buy Newcastle. Another \u00a3100m then went on debt reduction. That did not cover the \u00a327m still owed on transfers completed by his predecessors. Lifting his head from the worrisome accounts, he would have eyed the \"Ashley Out\" message on a protester's banner.</p> <p>Sympathy must not be allowed to get out of control. He has been reckless. More than that, Newcastle and West Ham failed dismally to come up with an approach to which all parties at each club could subscribe. In each case, a de facto sporting director was employed who gave the impression of acting without reference to the manager. At West Ham, Gianluca Nani, fairly or not, came to be considered as some kind of adversary for Curbishley.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in the north-east, Kevin Keegan seemed excluded from policy- making when he still felt that four substantial additions to the squad would be made at the start of this week. Come Tuesday, he merely had the Spain Under-21 forward Xisco and the loan signing Ignacio Gonz\u00e1lez. There had, until then, been indications that he wanted to maintain unity and he did not rail against the acceptance of Villa's \u00a312m offer for James Milner.</p> <p>West Ham and Newcastle will have had the best of intentions. Ashley has spoken as if the structure he put in place was born of compassion. \"You must make sure people aren't spread too thinly,\" he said three weeks ago. \"How could Kevin devote all his time to the first team if he also had to look after the academy? That's where Dennis Wise comes in.\"</p> <p>The flaw is so blatant that it seems impossible that it escaped Ashley's notice. Keegan hardly knew Wise. As with Nani and Curbishley, scant attention was paid to fostering a partnership. Instead there was the potential for division. Clubs will be in peril unless far more care is taken to ensure agreement and solidarity behind the scenes.</p>",
  "<p>A little over a week ago, Manchester City's executive chairman Garry Cook gave an interview which serves as a reminder of why we should always, always listen to the preposterous characters who run football.</p> <p>\"I was in Beijing last week,\" began Cook, \"sitting with [Thaksin Shinawatra] and the second richest man in China and other guys. They all want to be part of Manchester City. I've had representatives of companies from Dubai, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait on. Some of those representatives have actually phoned the supporters' club because they couldn't find the club number. So I get the supporters' club secretary saying to me, 'So the club is for sale, then, because I've got Anwar on the phone from Saudi Arabia?' This club is not for sale.\"</p> <p>Mm. We can't yet know whether the club's new Anwars are the type of people too stupid to be able to find its phone number, but they certainly talk an elegant game, thus far contriving to make Loadsamoney look like Gandhi. </p> <p>\"[Cristiano] Ronaldo has said he wants to play for the biggest club in the world, so we will see in January if he is serious,\" the deal's frontman Dr Sulaiman Al Fahim said on Tuesday, before casually mentioning he'd pay \u00a3135m for the United winger. \"But why not? We are going to be the biggest club in the world.\"</p> <p>With luck, there is something of the satirist to Dr Al Fahim, and he will go on to make ever more outlandish \"statements of intent\" - a phrase somewhat overused in recent days - perhaps outlining plans to purchase Rupert Murdoch for use as the club mascot, or acquiring Warren Buffett to man one of the Eastlands pie vans.</p> <p>As we all know, though, these days football is just a way of keeping score, by which of course one means keeping score in geopolitical powerplays, as opposed to in anything so low-level as games of football. Most crucial is Dr Al Fahim's statement that \"we hope that the purchase of City will help raise the profile of Abu Dhabi and emphasise the excellent work that is taking place there\".</p> <p>Tellingly, Dr Al Fahim already fronts one loss leader for the emirate, and so it is that Manchester City football club (est 1880) finds itself in the esteemed company of a reality TV show. And their shared frontman speaks about both of his properties in decidedly similar terms, recently declaring that \"the second season of Hydra Executives will once again highlight the promising prospects in Abu Dhabi as a key destination for entertainment, real estate and tourism sectors\".</p> <p>Hydra Executives appears to be loosely modelled on The Apprentice, with Dr Al Fahim in the Surallan role, though the prize of a $1m business grant does make the chance to work in Sugar's post-room look like rather small beer. At present, the show is aired in Abu Dhabi, but according to a February declaration of the credible Dr Al Fahim, he was \"finalising deals with leading television and media networks in Los Angeles and London\". As for which UK channel won what must have been a hotly contested bidding war ... to put it tactfully, no transmission date is yet scheduled. And yet, one can't help thinking these stalled negotiations are a blessing in disguise. </p> <p>Given the shared aims between the two ventures - both TV show and football club exist for the glorification of the emirate - would it not make sense for the good doctor to fuse them, and immediately begin shooting a reality series focusing on Manchester City? </p> <p>Certainly, the plotlines the new owners have already sketched out for the club make it ideal for this most spirit-warming modern medium. The show - call it Manchester Dhabi - could run along standard lines, with team-mates set a variety of amusing tasks, such as finishing in the top four of the Premier League, or enticing Cristiano Ronaldo to join without being able to promise him Champions League football, or stimulating $2bn property investment in Abu Dhabi, at the same time as distracting from its human rights record. </p> <p>These tasks will ideally lead to the holy grail of reality: conflict. Having said that, a credible punishment system also stimulates ratings, so failure to comply could result in team-mates being sent to one UAE's fine prisons, which may have failed to meet with the approval of those Lord Longfords in the US State Department, but are probably built in the shape of palm trees.</p> <p>And in keeping with all reality TV shows, Manchester Dhabi will conclude with all involved declaring they've gone on \"an incredible journey\". For once, it'll be hard to argue.</p>",

  "<p>The US vice-president, Dick Cheney, is due to arrive in Georgia's capital, Tbilisi, today to underline America's \"deep and abiding interests\" in the Caucasus, in the face of Russian warnings that any western moves to rearm the country could bring further instability, sharpening the standoff in the region between Moscow and Washington.</p> <p>As Cheney flew from Azerbaijan to Georgia in a regional tour intended to underline US resolve, the Bush administration unveiled a $1bn aid package to rebuild the country's civilian infrastructure. Cheney was also expected to discuss Georgia's long shopping list of military hardware to help rebuild its army, which was severely mauled in last month's brief conflict with Russia. </p> <p>Georgian officials have said they want to equip their army's existing four brigades with state of the art weaponry, and possibly add four more brigades. </p> <p>Any such move would worsen tensions with Russia, which has used its occupation of large swaths of Georgia to raze as many army bases, and destroy or confiscate as much equipment as possible.</p> <p>\"All these calls on Tbilisi [by the US] about the need to restore destroyed military capability do not in any way promote the stabilisation of the situation in the region,\" a Russian foreign ministry spokesman, Andrei Nesterenko, said.</p> <p>Russia's prime minister, Vladimir Putin, has accused Washington of having advance knowledge of, and participating in, Georgia's attack on South Ossetia last month. US military advisers had \"probably\" been involved in fighting Russian troops, Putin said.</p> <p>During his visit to Azerbaijan yesterday, Cheney told reporters that the region was \"in the shadow of the recent Russian invasion of Georgia\". \"President Bush has sent me here with a clear and simple message for the people of Azerbaijan and this entire region: the United States has deep and abiding interests in your well-being and security,\" Cheney said.</p> <p>The dispatch of the vice-president to the area is in itself a message. Cheney leads the hawkish wing of the Bush administration, and has championed taking a tough line with Russia.</p> <p>In his meeting with Georgia's leader, Mikheil Saakashvili, this morning, Cheney is expected to add his voice to calls for Russia to withdraw its troops from deep buffer zones it has carved in Georgian territory, outside the disputed regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia regions.</p> <p>Moscow's ambassador to London, Yuri Fedotov, said yesterday that Russia would withdraw its troops from those zones only when they could be replaced by international peacekeepers and once the Georgian government had signed non-aggression pacts with South Ossetia and Abkhazia.</p> <p>Fedotov said he \"deplored\" the severe criticism of Russia voiced recently by the prime minister, Gordon Brown, and the foreign secretary, David Miliband. He claimed to have repeatedly warned the Foreign Office about the worsening crisis in Georgia in the weeks leading up to August 7, when the conflict ignited. He said he had been assured that Saakashvili was \"under control\".</p> <p>The Foreign Office rejected Fedotov's account.</p> <p>The Russian ambassador was speaking to a group of journalists about the prospects for a deal at a summit next Monday, when the French and current EU president, Nicolas Sarkozy is due to fly to Moscow with the head of the EU commission, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, and the European foreign policy head, Javier Solana, to meet Russia's president, Dmitry Medvedev. </p> <p>\"I'm not in a position to anticipate the outcome of Monday's discussion, but if the EU proposes a very clear plan on how to prevent a potential confrontation and further shelling in the territory of South Ossetia ... then it's not difficult to deploy 200 or 400 people in the zones and to allow Russia to withdraw its personnel,\" Fedotov said.</p>",
  "<p>As you read this, another corner of Europe has been ethnically cleansed. That means young men murdered, old women driven out of their lifelong homes, villages plundered and torched. As in Bosnia, so now in South Ossetia, with the butcher's work largely done by irregular militias. \"We did carry out cleaning operations, yes,\" the militia leader \"Captain Elrus\" told the Guardian's Luke Harding. These violent crimes have been committed under the noses of Russian troops, now unilaterally rebranded peacekeepers by the simple expedient of being given blue helmets. This ethnic cleansing has extended to the buffer zone around South Ossetia that Russia has unilaterally established, exploiting an alleged loophole in the ceasefire agreement brokered by Nicolas Sarkozy on behalf of the European Union.</p> <p>These facts, established on the ground by brave and careful reporters, are the true human measure of Europe's failure to keep its cardinal promise of peace even in its own backyard. They are also the measure of Russia's deliberate, strategic challenge to the whole late-20th century way of doing politics and international relations that the EU represents. Do not underestimate the significance of this moment.</p> <p>Two things must be said, which complicate but do not negate the point. First, Georgia's leaders behaved with reprehensible folly in escalating the conflict in South Ossetia on August 7, allowing their forces to kill and wound civilians, and failing to anticipate the hammer blow of Russia's military reaction - despite indications that it had been rehearsed. \"We did not prepare for this kind of eventuality,\" confessed Batu Kutelia, the Georgian deputy defence minister. What irresponsible idiots.</p> <p>Second, the dying Bush administration behaved with characteristic incompetence in allowing the Georgian government to nurse even the shadow of a hope that the US cavalry might ride to the aid of this would-be Israel of the Caucasus. Warnings to the contrary were reportedly conveyed by the state department, but not with equal clarity from all parts of this dysfunctional administration. Worldwide ridicule of Washington's indignant response also demonstrated how much credibility the US has lost due to the invasion of Iraq. (Don't invade a sovereign country - that's what we do.)</p> <p>So, yes, there was fault in Tbilisi and Washington. But finding fault with the US (a sport at which Europeans excel) and Georgia (a faraway country of which most Europeans know nothing) reduces by not one jot or tittle the challenge Russia now poses to the whole way western Europe has tried to conduct human affairs since 1945 - and the creed most of Europe has lived by since 1989.</p> <p>\"Territorial integrity\" is not the heart of the matter here. The essence of our new European way of doing things is something more like procedural integrity. The frontiers of existing states must be respected, but in exceptional cases territories within states may negotiate special autonomies or even vote to become independent, like Slovakia and Kosovo, or perhaps Scotland one day - but always by peaceful means, by negotiation and consent, with the sanction of national and international law. The how matters even more than the what.</p> <p>That's our fundamental claim, which Putin's Russia now challenges head on. Its message is that the unilateral use of force in the advancement of national interests is part of what great powers do; that the EU's postmodern, multilateral, law-based order is a transient 20th-century anachronism; and that, in the words of Thucydides's Melian dialogue, \"the strong do what they can, and the weak submit\".</p> <p>So what is Europe's answer? The outcome of Monday's EU emergency summit was less bad than it might have been. By contrast with the last emergency summit, held five years ago over Iraq, a minimal unity was preserved. But the measures agreed were still weak. \"Thank God common sense triumphed,\" commented an apparently satisfied Vladimir Putin. And the unity itself is weak, reflecting differing levels of energy dependency on, and diverse historical experiences with, Russia. Moscow will do everything in its power to exploit these differences. Monday's Izvestia had a fascinating coloured map of EU states divided into four categories, with Britain and Poland tagged \"virulent critics\", while Germany, France, Belgium and Italy received the complimentary label of \"Moscow's lobbyists\".</p> <p>I found the tone of mild self-congratulation from Sarkozy and Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso at the post-summit press conference in Brussels inappropriate. You should not allow that tone to creep in when, even as you speak, poor women and children are being made destitute, if not worse, partly as a result of Europe's failure. A defeat is not a victory. And this summit can only be counted a success if it begins a fundamental rethinking of Europe's whole policy towards Russia.</p> <p>What we need is a twin-track approach, combining elements of muscular deterrence and skilful engagement - if you will, of cold war and detente. Putin's is not the only view in Russia. Hopes that President Medvedev's would soon be audibly different have receded, but there are others, including the private views of some worried Russian capitalists. It must remain clear that the door is still open to the kind of strategic partnership the west dreamed of in the 1990s, with Russia as a new pillar of liberal international order.</p> <p>Our new working assumption, however, must be that it will for the foreseeable future remain Putin's Russia: a ruthless great power, determined to roll back the influence of the west and establish its own 19th-century style sphere of influence in the post-Soviet space; and one prepared to use violence, intimidation and extortion to realise its national interests, which it defines as extending to the \"protection\" of millions of Russians in other sovereign states around its borders - in Crimea, for example, a part of the sovereign state of Ukraine where slightly more than half the population identify themselves as Russians and the Kremlin has its Black Sea fleet harboured at Sevastopol.</p> <p>Yalta, c'est fini, declared Sarkozy at the Brussels press conference, alluding to the alleged division of Europe into two spheres of influence at the 1945 Yalta conference. But a new kind of Yalta may be beginning - at that very same town in Crimea, and many like it, where Mother Russia yearns to look after her own. Europe must do what it can for Georgia, including a visible presence on the ground. But strategically even more important is to do what it can for Ukraine, a large and pivotal state that (unlike Georgia) still more or less controls all the territory within its borders.</p> <p>David Miliband was absolutely right to go there in response to the Georgian crisis. The EU should now give Ukraine a clear perspective of membership. It should put monitors, officials, lawyers, police advisers and development workers - Ukrainian and Russian-speaking - on the ground, especially in regions such as Crimea. Our response should be realistic in assessing not just Russia, but our strengths and weaknesses. Russia does tanks. Europe is not good at doing stuff with tanks. But we do a thousand other things, each smaller, softer and slower than a tank, which, given time and the perspective of eventual membership, can be a force more powerful. This European model is now on trial.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.timothygartonash.com\">timothygartonash.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The IRA's ruling body, the army council, no longer has an army to command and control, a British cabinet minister claimed last night.</p> <p>The Northern Ireland secretary, Shaun Woodward, made his claim that the IRA was dissolving after a politically sensitive report by the International Monitoring Commission, the organisation charged with overseeing the Provisionals' ceasefire.</p> <p>The commission reported yesterday that the IRA's seven-man army council had fallen into \"disuse\", but there would be no formal announcement of its being disbanded.</p> <p>Responding to the IMC's 19th report, Woodward told the Guardian yesterday: \"I would go further and say this: is there an army for the army council to direct? It now seems according to this report there is not.\"</p> <p>Privately, the British and Irish governments accept the IRA cannot publicly announce its ruling body has been dissolved because it fears that its base would feel humiliated. Such a move would also leave it open to charges of selling out to unionists by dissident republicans.</p> <p>In its latest report, the IMC said: \"The mechanism which they [the IRA] have chosen to bring the armed conflict to a complete end has been the standing down of the structures which engaged in the armed campaign, and the conscious decision to fall into disuse.\"</p> <p>It added: \"Now that that campaign is well and truly over, the army council by deliberate choice is no longer operational or functional.\"</p> <p>The report's authors also exonerated the IRA as an organisation from involvement in non-terrorist crimes, although it accepted some of its individual members or ex-members may be engaged in \"ordinary\" criminal activity.</p> <p>Overall, the ceasefire monitoring commission said the IRA posed no threat to peace or the democratic process. It said it saw \"no grounds\" for believing that the IRA and its membership could return to \"war\".</p> <p>The Irish government emphasised the significance of the IMC's conclusion that the IRA not only did not intend to return to war, but was also now incapable of doing so.</p> <p>\"This report demonstrates not only that PIRA has gone away, but that it won't be coming back. The IMC could not have been more unequivocal in its conclusion that the Provisional movement is now irreversibly locked into following the political path,\" Dermot Ahern, Ireland's justice minister, said yesterday.</p> <p>The latest report is critical, given the current pressures on the Northern Ireland power-sharing government. Sinn F\u00e9in has sent out thinly veiled warnings that unless policing and justice powers are transferred from London to Belfast, it may pull out of the devolved power-sharing government. </p> <p>The first minister and Democratic Unionist leader, Peter Robinson, has called on the IRA army council to disband so that unionists have full confidence in the political process. The lack of a formal announcement on the army council's future will pose problems for the unionists.</p> <p>Woodward said the findings meant there was now \"no rational reason\" for the Northern Ireland parties not to discuss all issues on the table, including the devolution of policing and justice powers.</p> <p>\"We have arrived. The time has come to move on. It's not a statement that is important - after all, the loyalists have made plenty of statements about decommissioning but they haven't decommissioned. By their actions rather than any statement the IRA is at a situation where it no longer poses any threat,\" Woodward said.</p> <p>Gordon Brown said the report should provide \"reassurance and hope\" to everyone who wanted an end to conflict in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>\"It is now time for all the political parties to work together to complete the final stages of the peace process - to complete the devolution of policing and justice.</p> <p>\"In the next few days, I will use all my efforts, working with the parties in Northern Ireland, to make sure that the devolution of policing and justice can go ahead,\" Brown said.</p>",
  "<p>One of Britain's most senior police officers has claimed government policies have damaged public and police confidence in the criminal justice system.</p> <p>Mike Fuller, chief constable of Kent, told the Guardian he believes dangerous criminals are avoiding jail or being released early because of a lack of places in the country's prisons.He claims the crisis was entirely foreseeable: five years ago, ministers ordered police to bring more offenders to justice, but failed to think through the consequences.</p> <p>He also said forces are over-inspected, with hours of his time each week wasted answering to 13 official national bodies, which sometimes gave contradictory advice and uncosted recommendations. Fuller said: \"Sentencing policy would appear to be determined more by the number of prison places rather than the seriousness of the crimes people have committed. That means recidivist offenders are being released from prison when they should not be.\"</p> <p>Fuller is regarded as a contender to be the next commissioner of Scotland Yard. Several top officers are jockeying for position to succeed Sir Ian Blair, whose term must end by January 2010, though a series of crises mean some expect he may not survive until then. A report in today's Times suggest that ministers, senior officials and leading police chiefs have secretly discussed replacement of the commissioner by the end of this year.</p> <p>Fuller continued: \"People committing serious and violent crimes are not receiving as long sentences as they should be, making the job of the police more difficult.\"</p> <p>To back up his claim, Kent police released details of some recent cases. According to the force, a burglar with 100 previous offences received a suspended sentence and then committed another one. Last week a man failed to appear in court having been given bail while awaiting sentence for 255 thefts from motor vehicles; police arrested him, and he was granted bail again - only to fail to show up at the time the court had ordered.</p> <p>Fuller said he and his officers were frustrated at the overall situation that had emerged over the last two years: \"The feeling is the police do their bit, they catch dangerous offenders, and sentencing policy is determined by prison places. It's a police perception, it's also my personal perception.\" He said that five years ago the government gave a national directive to increase offenders brought to justice: \"Not surprisingly, over that time, there has been increased pressure on prison places. What I'm saying, is these problems could have easily been foreseen.\"</p> <p>Asked who could have foreseen them he replied: \"One would have to point to the government.\"</p> <p>It had failed to realise how important the public thought tough sentences were: \"Sentencing is crucial to confidence. The government has underestimated how important sentencing is to public confidence.\"</p> <p>He said he was talking about offenders who commit burglary, car crime and violent street robberies, and not the most serious crimes of rape or murder.</p> <p>Recorded crime has been falling for three years, and latest figures show a 12% year-on-year fall, but the prison population is up from 61,000 in 1997 to 83,000 today. The length of a typical jail sentence rose by 13% between 1996 and 2006 to 25.2 months, but has fallen from a peak of 25.9 months. Government figures also show the number of jail sentences handed out by the courts began to fall between 2005 and 2006, down 3% for crown courts and 7% for magistrates.</p> <p>Richard Garside, director of the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies at King's College London, said: \"The current overcrowding crisis at most is merely intensifying the long-term problem of prisons entrenching, rather than addressing, crime and offending.</p> <p>\"Ministers have exacerbated the problem by setting targets for the police and other criminal justice agencies that, as our research shows, often have little if anything to do with reducing crime or increasing the safety of the public. This is an argument for reducing our reliance on prison as a means of responding to crime, not building ever more places in response to ill-thought-out policy initiatives.\"</p> <p>Fuller is the first chief constable from an ethnic minority background, and he is seen as a possible future commissioner of the Met. His rivals for the highest job in British policing are Ulster's top officer, Sir Hugh Orde; Bernard Hogan-Howe from Merseyside; and Sir Norman Bettison from West Yorkshire.</p> <p>Fuller became Kent's chief constable in 2004 after a 26-year career in the Met. He helped set up Operation Trident, tackling gun violence within African-Caribbean communities, and is a former chair of the Black Police Association. Fuller is also believed to be the only chief constable who is also a qualified barrister.</p> <p>In the interview, Fuller also took aim at the government's attempts to ensure the police are up to scratch. He said up to 13 bodies had the right to inspect his force: \"There's always somebody inspecting us, or we're under the threat of inspection. It is a constant inspection process. Probably at least a third of my time is spent dealing with inspection, inspection processes, preparing for inspection, accounting to inspection bodies.\" He said some inspection bodies made contradictory recommendations: \"It actually takes us away from our core role. There's been too many targets... We've been over-inspected by too many agencies who often don't cost their recommendations, who often don't talk to each other or share information...\"</p> <p>He said accountability was important, but this was best done at a local level: \"There is more benefit in being locally accountable than being accountable to central government bodies.\"</p> <p>Fuller said his force faced this level of inspection despite performing well.</p> <p>He refused to comment directly on the claim of racial discrimination bought by Met assistant commissioner Tarique Ghaffur against Sir Ian Blair. However, he said of a series of race claims bought by senior ethnic minority officers against the Met: \"Potentially it is very damaging for recruitment if the service can't be seen to progress BME [black and minority ethnic] officers and retain them.\"</p> <p>Of his own career, he said his race had led him to be the subject of more critical scrutiny: \"I'm judged more critically by the media, by my staff, by my peers, because of my colour.\"He had received a friendly reception from officers when he took over Kent four years ago. But he told of one officer who, despite having a black chief constable committed to diversity as a boss, had only carried out stops and searches on black people. The officer was caught two years ago and disciplined.</p> <p>A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: \"Public confidence in the criminal justice system has increased significantly in recent years and we are working hard to bring more offenders to justice and to improve services to victims and witnesses. Since 1997 the government has increased prison capacity by over 23,000 places. Sentencing in individual cases is a matter for the courts.\"</p>",
  "<p>A man who regularly won and lost millions in a night at London casinos won again yesterday when the high court upheld his refusal to pay \u00a32m in gambling debts after he cancelled a cheque because he disliked the croupier at Aspinall's and considered the game unfair.</p> <p>But Fouad al-Zayat, a Syrian-born, Cyprus-based businessman nicknamed the Fat Man, failed in a claim to force the casino to return a further \u00a310.5m losses. He will have to pay his own costs, which are enormous after almost two years of legal actions.</p> <p>Yesterday Mr Justice Teare repeated the judge's comment from an earlier hearing: \"This is one of those cases which have everything to do with law and nothing to do with justice.\"</p> <p>The dispute between Aspinall's and one of its most lucrative clients dates back to a Friday night in March 2000 when Zayat settled down to a game of blackjack. He was well known at the club: he first started playing there in 1994, and over more than 600 visits bought \u00a391m in gaming chips and lost more than \u00a323m.</p> <p>That night he lost steadily, and by the small hours of Saturday was more than \u00a32m down, his worst losses in a single game. At one point he asked for the croupier to be changed, but was told none other was available. When he discovered that there had been another croupier on duty, he was enraged and told his bank to stop the cheque; when the casino tried to bank it the following Tuesday, it bounced.</p> <p>Aspinall's, reluctant to lose its whale - as the highest-stake gamblers are known - delayed proceeding against him for almost six years, during which he lost another \u00a310.6m. \"Not surprisingly he was regarded by the club as an important client who demanded and was shown respect,\" said the judge.</p> <p>The casino won an initial judgment that he must pay up, and assets including a personal jet were temporarily frozen. However, Zayat then won the right to launch the appeal which was upheld yesterday, on the grounds that in delaying attempting to recover the debt, the club had in effect given him credit, which is illegal under the Gaming Act. His additional claim for the return of his subsequent losses - when the club allowed him to buy chips using third-party cheques or debit cards - was thrown out.</p> <p>There was no official response from the club yesterday, but Andrew Herd, one of the directors, said it would be considering the judgment carefully. </p> <p>The Fat Man has not been seen there recently, nor as far as Aspinall's knows at any of the other London casinos which were once his haunts.</p> <p>There was no response from Zayat either. However, last year, in one of only a handful of interviews he has ever given, he explained why he was fighting the debt: \"Casinos give a service, and if the service is not good, considering the price which you are paying, then you do not pay.

  "<p>The Hungarian pianist Andr\u00e1s Schiff is a musician with a sense of history. In his music room, which takes up most of the first floor of his mews house in west London, there are two grand pianos, one a gleaming modern black instrument, the other a burnished, aged Steinway. Before we go upstairs to talk, I ask if I can look around the room, where Schiff has prepared some of the most memorable concerts of the past three decades. Where does the Steinway come from? \"Oh, that's Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler's piano,\" he says, casually, as if it were quite normal to have a piano that once belonged to the inspirational German conductor, who died in 1954. I am briefly speechless. \"His widow gave it to me,\" he explains. \"It was in their house in L\u00fcbeck, and she didn't know what to do with it. Anyway, let's go up.\"</p> <p>This weekend Schiff celebrates 30 years, to the day, of music-making at the Wigmore Hall in London, playing the same piece he played there on September 7 1978, Bach's Goldberg Variations. It is music he loves deeply and has recorded twice, by the composer he has probably been most closely associated with over the years: he says he plays music by Bach every day of his life. \"It's shocking how quickly it all happened,\" he says in his almost perfectly idiomatic English (he still has a Hungarian accent). \"I look back on 30 years and remember that I was a young man, almost a boy\" - he was 25, in fact - \"and I remember when I was with people, I was usually the youngest in the company. That time feels like a moment, and I look back on those years with great joy and pleasure. But I would not like to turn back the wheel of history. I am very happy to be where I am now, and not to be the youngest in my circle of friends, or a group of people, but to be taken more seriously.\" Does he take himself more seriously, at the not-that-grand-old age of 55? \"Me? No!\" he laughs. \"But some people do.\" </p> <p>This is not surprising. Schiff is an engagingly passionate advocate of the music he loves the most - Bach, Schumann, Chopin, Mozart, Schubert, Bart\u00f3k - both as a pianist and, in recent years, as a conductor. His relationship with this core classical repertoire was forged in his early life in Hungary. \"I was born in 1953, the year Stalin died, and I was very fortunate to be Hungarian. If I had been brought up in France or Germany, it would have been a very different story.\" But surely growing up in what was still a communist dictatorship cannot have been conducive to creativity? \"The worst years of communism were over,\" Schiff says, \"and in the 1970s there was a certain easing procedure, what they later called Goulash Communism. I studied at the Budapest Academy, which was like an oasis. It was a pretty grim life as far as freedom of movement or speech or thought were concerned - but music, the most abstract of the arts, they could control the least. That was very important. Music meant a lot to people.\" Schiff remembers the pianist Sviatoslav Richter coming to play in Budapest: thousands of people queued for tickets, and the police had to be called in to exercise classical music crowd control.</p> <p>But Schiff's most abiding influence is Gy\u00f6rgy Kurt\u00e1g, 80 this year and one of the world's greatest living composers. It was Kurt\u00e1g who taught him piano and chamber music. \"I will never forget my first lesson with him: I just had to play a Three Part Invention by Bach in E major\" - a bread-and-butter piece of any piano student's repertoire - \"and we were working on this little Invention for about two and a half hours. We couldn't even get through the first three bars,\" Schiff laughs. \"Kurt\u00e1g was talking about vitally important things - tone-quality, harmony, articulation, counterpoint - and in that first lesson, I learned that music is not just a matter of life and death, it's more important than that.\"</p> <p>Kurt\u00e1g's modesty meant he never taught Schiff any of his own compositions. \"But he had a composer's approach to music, which he passed on to me,\" Schiff says. \"It's not the pianist's approach to music. I think it's a much higher level of integrity. Instrumentalists often get lost in technicalities and minor details. Composers know the hierarchy of what matters in music.\" Schiff is no composer himself. \"It does hurt me somehow, that I have no talent for that. I would love to be able to do something, but probably I would not consider it good enough. And there is enough bad music in the world.\"</p> <p>For all Schiff's high-mindedness - he talks of the moral dimension he hears in great music, and of Beethoven as a prophet - there is an impish side to his character. His blue eyes twinkle subversively when we talk about the ageing Wigmore Hall audience (\"Some people worry that the audience is old, but I don't - I love old people\") and his concerts, especially his Mozart performances, are full of earthiness and impetuosity. Even the title of the ad-hoc orchestra he conducts a few times a year, the Cappella Andrea Barca, is an in-joke, an over-literal Italianisation of his name (in German, Schiff means \"boat\", or \"barca\" in Italian). \"One should never lose a sense of humour,\" he says - and I notice he is wearing blue slippers - \"to be able to laugh at yourself. The artists I've admired the most were those who combined wisdom with child-like innocence. I worshipped Mieczyslaw Horszowski [who was still playing as a 100-year-old], who could give you a performance of Mozart that was quite unique. As Artur Schnabel said, 'Mozart is too easy for children and too difficult for adults.' Very talented children can give wonderful Mozart performances, and old men can do it - it's very difficult when you're in between.\" </p> <p>But it is Beethoven who has dominated Schiff's creative universe for the past few years. After a complete cycle of piano sonatas at the Wigmore Hall a couple of years ago (you can still hear Schiff's fascinating lectures about each sonata on the Guardian website), Schiff proudly tells me that he's about to complete his 20th performance of all 32 sonatas. \"It's strange - when I'm so deeply absorbed in a composer, as I have been with Beethoven, then I physically and mentally begin to feel like him. Beethoven changed me as a person. Hopefully not for the worse - no, I don't think so.\" I have images of Schiff mutating into everyone's favourite tousled-haired compositional genius before my eyes: does he really mean that he becomes the composer, not just on the stage, but in the rest of his life, too? \"Well, there are composers who enrich you and uplift you - Beethoven is the best example. As a composer and as a person, I feel he has a lot of generosity. But I remember there were years when I was playing a lot of Chopin, which is very great music, but I cannot relate to Chopin the person. When I was playing his music, I always felt he was saying, 'Don't do this, don't do that, this is too much, this is too little.' I felt that as a performer, I didn't have enough choices. Chopin wears you out. But I find that with Bach and Beethoven, I have enormous choices. You can play a Bach fugue in 10 different tempi and it will still be good.\" And Mozart? \"Mozart is a strange case, but with him the choices are narrower. In that sense, he's closer to Chopin.\"</p> <p>Next up for Schiff is Debussy. \"I have hardly played any of his music, and he is very different from the composers I usually play, but actually it's a quite logical step. However, to get into this world I have to improve my French considerably.\" It is typical of Schiff to inhabit any composer's music in this way: he has to be well-versed in the literature, culture and politics of their time and place. And how does he expect Debussy to feel? Generous like Beethoven, or constricting, like Chopin? \"My instinct is that he will be generous.\" Just as well: if Schiff's previous immersions in composers and their music is anything to go by, his Debussy project will be huge in scale and ambition. His beloved Wigmore Hall audience is in for a treat.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 Andr\u00e1s Schiff</strong> plays the Wigmore Hall, London, on Sunday and Tuesday (box office: 020-7935 2141); the final instalments of his complete Beethoven cycle on ECM are released later this year</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Saturday September 13 2008.

  "<p>Every six months, for the better part of my life, I have been making a seasonal journey to Bangladesh. I left Dhaka at the age of two, and I have always called it home, though the city my parents and I left in the 70s is unrecognisable, now a jumble of Lego-shaped buildings, barely a road or a tree between them. My visits home, which used to consist of lazy rickshaw rides around Dhanmondi Lake, are now spent waiting in the frozen car-seas of Dhaka traffic. And, of course, there are family visits and long lunches and my parents, who wait eagerly for me and shower me with affection, no matter how old I am, or how often I have disappointed them by refusing to move back.</p> <p>But this time around, I am leaving the city and travelling to an island off the banks of the Jamuna river, to learn how people are adapting to a difficult environment. I was recently told by a journalist that, having written a novel about the birth of my country, perhaps I should now write about its death. Bangladesh is sinking under the weight of the rising seas, one of the first victims of our transforming climate. Already there are great swaths of land in the coastal belt that have surrendered to the tides. </p> <p>The facts about climate change in Bangladesh are indeed grim. The country is a low-lying delta, meaning any slight shift in sea levels will cause the land to be slowly swallowed by the waters of the Bay of Bengal. In the next 50 years, 17% of Bangladesh's landmass is sure to go underwater, causing more than 30 million people to become homeless. Those who live further inland will be only slightly better off: the cyclones and floods that are already a feature of the weather will occur more frequently and with greater ferocity. Geological events stimulated by changes in temperature will mean intense pulses of rainfall followed by periods of drought, and a potential collapse of the monsoon cycle itself. If the sea level rises by 5m (16ft), Dhaka will go under. This is the grim reality that the delegates of the UK/Bangladesh climate change conference, taking place in London next Wednesday, will aim to address. In expectation of the climate change deal that will be struck in Copenhagen next year, it is critical that Bangladesh's concerns are more widely known and understood.</p> <p>But I have no intention of sounding the death-knell. I know that people in Bangladesh have, for generations, adapted to the cruelties of nature, and my destination is an example of their tenacity. Deep in the delta, a group of islanders, repeated victims of flooding and river erosion, have found a way to live with their unreliable, unforgiving landscape. The small islands on which they live - forced there because, in a country of 180 million people, every inch of available space has to be used - have an average life span of nine years before they are made uninhabitable. I wonder how these islanders cope with this shifting terrain; how they can bear to know that the place they are living in today may not exist tomorrow. I want to know because more and more people in Bangladesh will suffer the same lot, as the sea creeps up; and because, in the not so distant future, this may be the fate of humanity worldwide. </p> <p>The Jamuna river is often called the \"Jamuna braid\". It is 22km at its widest point and it splits into estuaries and channels, diverging and reconnecting to create a shifting landscape that is part land, part water. It is in the Jamuna braid that most of Bangladesh's chars are located. The chars - islands made of river silt - are strange land formations that inhabit the space between land and water. Every year in Bangladesh, new chars emerge out of the river's changing course; and as they appear, old ones are returned to the water, swallowed by the river as though it is collecting on an old debt. The story of these chars, and the people who inhabit them, is a catalogue of migrating loss, of land earned and forsaken. Here, in the Jamuna braid, the Chars Livelihood Project (CLP), a collaboration between the Bangladesh government and the UK's department for international development, has been helping islanders cope with their uncertain terrain.</p> <p>It takes three hours to crawl out of Dhaka, and after crossing the Jamuna Bridge, we arrive at the office of our local hosts. Habibullah Bahar has been working on this stretch of the Jamuna river for almost three decades. He is softly spoken, and piles my plate with breakfast as I quiz him about the chars. There is a not-quite-thereness about them. \"Who owns the land,\" I ask, \"is it the government?\" He smiles in such a way that I feel foolish for even asking. Of course not; a place that will only exist for an unknowable amount of time is not going to come under the umbrella of the state. </p> <p>Chars don't become habitable until they are a few years old. You can tell their age, Bahar tells me, by the wild plants that grow on them. When chars are taken by the river, often their inhabitants have to move in with their relations, or find some other piece of land on which to build a house. In any case, they will only have enough on which to live: they have nothing to till, so the men hire themselves out as weavers or day-labourers. This is why, according to development-speak, char-dwellers are the \"hard-core poor\". It is because they own nothing, and even the ground beneath their feet is a fleeting luxury.</p> <p>After breakfast, we make our way to the riverbank, where a six-seater speedboat waits for us. The men climb into waterproof jackets and trousers. I am wondering what to do with my sari, when I am offered a long robe. \"Burkha,\" the speedboat driver tells me, \"waterproof\". I'm in the middle row, next to Bahar, and he hands me an umbrella. It's raining on the shore, but I can't imagine why I would need an umbrella on a speedboat.</p> <p>It takes about a minute for me to find out. Our swift movement upriver barrels water into the boat, and there it is joined by lashings from the river-tide. The small estuary widens, the banks yawn open, and the water splashes on to our laps. The umbrella saves me from being beaten in the face, but I'm soaked through, burkha and all, before we have barely begun. </p> <p>On the way, Bahar points out the new islands. \"This one came up last month,\" he says, pointing to a small stretch of muddy land. The riverbank is jagged, and every once in a while I see chunks of it breaking off and disappearing into the water. Two hours later, we veer off the main river and the banks narrow. The driver switches off the engine, a group of men arrive on shore to pull our boat into the channel, and we arrive on Chouhali char.</p> <p>The landscape is dimpled, the homesteads rising out of the ground in neat rectangular plots. This is what the CLP is giving the islanders. They call them plinths. Char-dwellers have always built their homesteads on raised ground, knowing that their proximity to the water means that their land will be the first to go under in the event of a flood. The CLP project has taken this model and raised the homesteads of the poorest islanders. They have also given them access to clean water, latrines and a small cash advance. There are still parts of the island that can be walked, but in a few weeks, with the monsoon, each of these homes will be surrounded by water, little islands of their own.</p> <p>The first thing I notice is that there are no men in the village. No one owns any arable land, so the men hire themselves out as day-labourers. Most of them work as weavers in nearby towns. The absence of men means that women do all the work: cutting grass for their cows, collecting firewood, patching up their homes with whatever they can find, tending their gardens. And, of course, there are children to raise and feed. </p> <p>Chouhali has no electricity, no running water, no hospitals, roads or government offices. It has a school, a long, rectangular building that has been divided in two for the upper and lower grades. When the floods arrived last year, it was this building that sheltered the villagers whose homes were submerged. The children stand to attention when we arrive, and a boy in a black sequined shirt offers to perform for us. \"When I die,\" he sings, \"who will come to bury me?\"</p> <p>I am supposed to stay the night with Joneka, whose plinth is a few months old. Of all the poor residents of Chouhali, Joneka is considered one of the poorest. Before I meet her I am told that she is a widow. Having no land of her own to till, and no man to provide a weekly wage, she and her two young sons rely on her small patch of garden for food. Recently, the CLP has been giving her a small stipend, to tide her over until she can sell her cow in the market. </p> <p>I arrive on Joneka's plinth. She wears a long blue dress with a matching scarf. Her features are severe, but as soon as she sees me she breaks into a smile and greets me as though we are old friends. I ask after her in the common Bengali greeting, \"Kemon achen?\" (\"Are you well?\"), and she replies confidently in her only word of English: \"Fine.\" On one side of the plinth is Joneka's house, a flimsy structure that is held together with grass and jute. The thatched roof is leaking. She is going to get a piece of tin in the next few weeks; the one she has, borrowed from her brother-in-law, is for the cow. The inside of the house is crowded with all her possessions: a small bundle of firewood, two cooking pots, and a stove built into the ground. </p> <p>I ask Joneka how her husband died. \"The electric current fell on him,\" she says. \"We were visiting my sister in town. No one came to help because they knew they would die too if they touched him. They took him to the hospital, but it was too late.\"</p> <p>Joneka couldn't go back to her in-laws' house and, as a married woman, her father would no longer take her in. She relied on the charity of her sisters, and spent six years living on the edge of starvation. It wasn't until she moved to Chouhali, and came under the CLP, that she was given a cow, a latrine and a source of clean water. Once she sells the cow in the market, she will have enough savings to become self-reliant. I ask her if she will remarry, and she shakes her head resolutely. \"If I married,\" she says, \"I wouldn't be able to keep my children.\" I think of my grandmother, who was widowed at 26 and never remarried. She has always told me it was because she didn't believe any man would love her children as he should.</p> <p>Joneka and I spend long hours together. She lays out a jute mat for me, and while she sews a blanket (she will sell it to a neighbour for 50p), we talk of many things. She asks why I am not married, and I describe my life of freedom and exile in London. My tongue is loose and easy. But as evening draws near, the rain starts. Joneka's roof is leaking again, and there is not enough dry space, between the stove and the firewood, for us both to sleep. I bid her farewell as it grows dark, after she has prayed by the light of her hurricane lamp. She will eat a quick meal and fall asleep early; she doesn't want to use too much oil.</p> <p>On the day I am to leave, Joneka hosts a gathering of women from the village. I ask them how many times the river has taken their homes. \"Eleven,\" one says. \"Seventeen,\" says another. Each time, they have barely escaped with their lives, every one of their possessions gone in a flash. I play with their children as they tell me, in loud voices, how grateful they are for their raised ground. They want to thank me, and I have to explain that it has nothing to do with me. \"I'm only a writer,\" I say. \"I've just come to write about you.\" Why have you come all this way, they want to know, and I can't give them a straight answer. \"It's true,\" I say, \"I have come a long way, because I wanted to meet you. I am not here to give you anything.\" Joneka looks resplendent in her only sari, and she holds me to her chest. \"You are my sister,\" she says.</p> <p>I return to Dhaka, forsaking the speedboat for the slower, more melancholic country boat. On the way, I see more breaks on the riverbank, and, all of a sudden, a tree floating on the surface of the water. It hovers, vertical, for a moment before sinking into the swirl of the tide. </p> <p>At home, I cannot stop thinking about Chouhali. When I am asked about the trip, I find myself not knowing what to say. I am reminded of what VS Naipaul wrote in The Enigma of Arrival, his memoir about exile. \"I saw what I saw very clearly. But I didn't know what I was looking at. I had nothing to fit it into.\" I'm struck dumb by how little I still know. I thought I would come back with an idea of how the Chouhali islanders had learned to live their lives of uncertainty; how they built their houses and grew their crops, how they fed themselves and raised their children, how they patched their roofs and grazed their cattle. And I wanted more intimate truths: how they bore up against the cruelties of their environment; what it was that allowed them to keep on after their homes had been taken by the river 10 or 20 times. But I learned nothing of that. I can only say that I began to feel my way around the vast, impenetrable mystery that lies in the distance between my life and Joneka's.</p> <p>It is time to return to London. On my last day, as I am saying a tearful farewell to my grandmother, wondering if she will still be here when I come again, the phone rings. Joneka has borrowed Bahar's mobile to say goodbye. \"Did you get your tin?\" I ask. There is a smile in her voice as she tells me that she sent her brother to the market. \"The roof is solid,\" she tells me. \"Now you can come and stay\".</p> <p><strong> \u00b7 </strong>Tahmima Anam is the author of A Golden Age, published by John Murray at \u00a314.99.</p>",
  "<p>At a time when the Tate has had a record year for acquisitions, bringing works valued at \u00a363.1m into its collection, the UK's most important art institution is poised to push the power of its brand to new levels of domination. </p> <p>Nor will it be limiting its reach to dry land. In a three-year deal with P&amp;O, a scheme called Tate Cruises has recently been established, with passengers idling around the Mediterranean or the Baltic being lectured to by Tate experts.</p> <p>\"It is a good opportunity to develop new audiences,\" said the Tate's director of media, Will Gompertz, adding that the outreach programme was \"also financially beneficial to Tate\".</p> <p>While the Guggenheim and the Louvre are building high-profile outposts in Abu Dhabi, the Tate is looking at a different approach to establishing a greater presence overseas and at home, by creating partnerships with existing institutions. </p> <p>For the moment, though, the focus is national. \"Our job is to serve people across the country,\" said Paul Myners, the Tate's chairman. \"Tate Liverpool and Tate St Ives are manifestations of that ... over the next years we will see Tate increasingly active outside London and Liverpool. We are a national institution, and sometimes we must go to the customer.\"</p> <p>That might mean sending more works out on loan, according to Tate director Nicholas Serota, or working in partnership with galleries such as the Ikon Gallery in Birmingham or Mima in Middlesbrough. The recent gift of 725 works of contemporary art from former art dealer Anthony D'Offay will also tour around the country from 2009. </p> <p>The Tate's stupendous acquisitions in the past financial year also included the Sainsbury bequest of 18 masterpieces to the National Gallery and Tate. In addition, Damien Hirst gave four works and Louise Bourgeois donated her giant spider sculpture, Maman. There was also a bequest of a Stanley Spencer and a Bacon, Figures in a Garden, from c1936.</p> <p>The past year has also seen Serota's contract, which was due to have expired in 2009, extended indefinitely - a mark of his successful tenure, the only threat to which is the problem of raising \u00a3215m to build the projected Tate Modern extension by 2012 in a shaky economic climate. Only \u00a370m has so far been pledged, and the Tate yesterday refused to commit itself to completing the landmark building, by architects Herzog and De Meuron, in time for the Olympics. But if the project failed to go ahead, said Myners, it would be \"a blow to the nation\".</p> <p>Highlights of next year's programme will include a look at two giants of the Russian avant-garde, Alexander Rodchenko and Lybov Popova. It is, perhaps, an auspicious choice when canny eyes in the arts fundraising world turn their attention to the Russian super-rich in search of donations.</p> <p>In royalist contrast to that revolutionary fervour, Tate Britain is to host a blockbuster exhibition entitled Van Dyck and Britain, from February. The centrepiece will be the artist's huge equestrian portrait of Charles I. </p> <p>The autumn will also see at Tate Britain a large-scale show devoted to Turner and his rivals - or at least his imagined rivals, since most of them were long dead. Paintings by the great British artist will be set alongside Old Masters by the likes of Rembrandt, Poussin and Claude Lorrain, demonstrating how fervently he attempted to outdo his predecessors. </p> <p>At Tate Modern, the main summer exhibition will offer a revisionist view of futurism, the controversial modernist movement that is often associated with the birth of Italian fascism. It will assemble works by Boccioni, Severini, Carr\u00e0 and Balla, as well as British artists influenced by futurism, notably Wyndham Lewis.</p> <p>The autumn will see an exhibition at Tate Modern called Sold Out, examining pop art and its legacy, and looking at the ways in which artists since Warhol have created their own brands and aggressively marketed themselves.

  "<p>They are plucked off pizzas and discarded from caesar salads across the country, but somebody, somewhere has been eating too many anchovies. The fish that has divided food fans for years is today named on a list of unsustainable fish and shellfish that ethical consumers should not eat. </p> <p>Anchovy is among dozens of \"fish to avoid\" highlighted by the Marine Conservation Society (MCS). Anchovy populations in the Bay of Biscay have been struggling since 2002, as overfishing left fewer adult fish to provide eggs. The fishery suffered a complete failure in 2004 and is now officially closed. Stocks in the other big European anchovy fishery - off the Portuguese coast - are also critical. Anchovies are still legally caught there, though quotas have been restricted. </p> <p>In a report on hundreds of types of fish, the society has awarded each kind a ranking from 1 to 5, after assessing its biology, stock status, management and the impact of the farming or fishing method. Sixty-nine received the worst rating of 5, including monkfish from north and northwest Spain, North Sea cod and dogfish. Others to avoid include the Atlantic salmon, common skate and swordfish.</p> <p>The society's list does not label entire species unacceptable to eat, but tries to explain that whether a certain type of fish is sustainable or unsustainable depends on where and how it was caught. It gives Dover sole caught by wasteful beam trawling in the North Sea and Irish Sea a 5 rating and says they should be avoided, while those from a sustainable fishery off Hastings are rated 2 and recommended.</p> <p>Such detail is rarely made available to consumers, with current legislation only requiring the common name and rough geographical location to be included on labels. The society is calling for better labelling in restaurants and shops to help consumers choose more environmentally-friendly options.</p> <p>Sam Wilding, a fisheries officer with the society, said: \"Labelling of seafood sold in the UK is lacking detail, and as such is not fit for purpose. This is leading to confusion. It is vital that consumers are given better information to act upon if we are to reduce the tragedy of overfishing.\"</p> <p>He said anchovies in European waters were at an all-time low. \"There are not many anchovy left in European waters, and we say people should avoid them, to give populations a chance to recover.\"</p> <p>Willie Mackenzie, oceans campaigner at Greenpeace, said: \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/sep/04/fishing.wildlife\">You pick up some tuna in a supermarket</a> and it might say it comes from the Indian and Pacific oceans. Well, that covers half the world, it could be one of several different species, and it could have been caught in lots of different ways. We really need better labelling with more detailed information to help consumers do the right thing.\"</p> <p>Chris Brown, head of ethical and sustainable sourcing at Asda, said more detail risked confusing customers. He said Asda stocked marlin, which features on the MCS's \"fish to avoid\" list, but claimed it was sustainable because it was not deliberately targeted, but caught as inevitable \"by-catch\" in a sustainable tuna fishery off Sri Lanka, and would otherwise be disposed of. \"I can't write all of that on the label,\" he said.</p> <p>Brown said it was down to retailers to take more responsibility, and accused some restaurants and supermarkets of confusing the situation by selling sustainable ray, but labelling it as unsustainable skate, because customers are more likely to buy familiar species.</p> <p>The society said cod demonstrated why precise labelling was important, with cod from the north-east Arctic a more sustainable choice than those from the North Sea.The MCS has certified some cod fisheries in the Pacific as sustainable, and also said consumers could choose organically-farmed Atlantic cod. Wilding called on shoppers and diners to ask more questions about the source of their fish. \"Our advice is to ask the waiter or waitress. They might not know at the moment but part of what we're trying to do is to improve training, and raising awareness is important for that.\" He said the society had produced a pocket-sized version of the list that could be used as a reference.</p> <p>Philip MacMullen, head of environmental responsibility at the industry body Seafish, said: \"It is genuinely difficult to be sure of all the details of any given fish supply line. To this extent advice given via lists ... must match the reality of the available information. We should not be raising unrealistic expectations. The complexities of fisheries also mean that it is difficult to rely on a simple eat-and-avoid list. Fish stocks are dynamic and can change their status quite quickly.\"</p>",
  "<p>With record sums having been paid for transfers of foreign players to English clubs and the takeover of Manchester City by another foreigner, the news that Michel Platini, the president of Uefa, is to hold an inquiry into the disparity between the rich and poor clubs is to be warmly welcomed (Platini launches inquiry into level of club debts, August 29; You're bought! Abu Dhabi's answer to Sir Alan Sugar in Manchester City takeover, September 2). For too long, the football authorities have failed to take any effective action against the distortion in competition - in both a sporting and a business sense - of football clubs, which cannot be for the \"good of the game\" or the fans. Let us hope that this time something meaningful results.<br><strong>Professor Ian Blackshaw</strong><br>The International Sports Law Centre, <br>The Hague, Netherlands</p> <p>Imagine that someone allied to a track record of human rights abuses periodically sold off his country's primary export commodity at a high price, thereby further securing his undemocratic and repressive tenure.

Not so. Manchester City, and all British football clubs, deserve better.<br><strong>Shashank Joshi </strong><br>Department of government, Harvard University</p> <p>Daniel Taylor reports on the hundreds of millions of pounds that are exchanged in the buying of Premier League players just prior to the transfer window closing. Since every penny of this money has come from offshore, does any agency check as to the provenance of this money? </p> <p>Is it clean, tax-paid and not from the proceeds of criminal activity? Quite frankly, it is beyond the FA to undertake such a task, but surely there should be some checks performed, especially since foreign money has a huge stake in the Premier League in this country?<br><strong>Roger Marsh </strong><br>Morecambe, Lancashire </p> <p>Your editorial (Blue heaven, September 3) on the surreal goings-on at Manchester City is all the more poignant when the roots of the club are taken into account. In 1880, Anna Connell, the 25-year-old daughter of the rector of St Mark's Church in Gorton, founded the football club that became the Eastlands-based plc we know today. </p> <p>Connell fought for improvements in Gorton, which suffered chronically poor housing and sanitation, through the vehicle of football, advocating playing fields and healthier living. But who has heard of Anna Connell today? Manchester City's new owners? As we witness the bonkers enrichment of a few clubs, football's billionaire owners and millionaire players would do well to remember that the sport of football grew out of a need to improve the health of the disadvantaged, foster community cohesion and alleviate poverty. Football's relentless, and ultimately unsustainable, pursuit of profit is a betrayal of its founding spirit. <br><strong>Nick Reeves </strong><br>London</p> <p>Peter Preston talks about the experience of one football fan as being by \"precise design\" (Fantasy Football, September 1). Yet the English football we now have is entirely \"precise by design\" - the FA's blueprint for the future of football back in the early 1990s, which led to the formation of the Premier League, has been immensely successful. </p> <p>Three issues nevertheless remain unaddressed by Preston. First, as with all conspicuous consumers, keeping up with the Joneses is vital. Trying to address what has become of our domestic game is no easy matter when the money and players that so many clubs crave are up for grabs by many other clubs from across Europe. Second, and related to this, not unaware of the spiralling problems in football, the EU has included sport as one of nine competences it is seeking to achieve through the Lisbon treaty. The problem is that the treaty has not yet been ratified. Third, as we all know, whatever rises, falls. Italian football in 2008 is more like English football in 1988. Market forces dictate that the current situation in England surely cannot last.<br><strong>Professor Simon Chadwick</strong><br>Director, Centre for the International Business of Sport, Coventry University</p> <p>Peter Preston's assessment of the chronic inequalities in Premier League football omits one major element; poverty pay for backroom staff. Our joint study with the IPPR showed that low pay for cleaners, security guards, retail and hospitality staff is endemic throughout the league, with some barely scraping even the minimum wage. Our campaign for fair pay in the premiership is supported by the Football Supporters' Federation, the minister for sport and the mayor of London.

  "<p>A sell-out crowd turned up. But it had rained during the previous day and into the night, already leaving any start a precarious possibility. Play finally did get under way, but two hours late, by which time the match had already been reduced to 43 overs per side. Three overs into the game, time enough only for Matt Prior to clutch another one-handed stunner to see the back of Herschelle Gibbs, another intense shower washed in on a biffing breeze and sent the players scurrying from the field once more. Regular top-ups ensured they never returned.</p> <p>A washout meant that for the first time in his brief tenure as England captain Kevin Pietersen's luck had run out. Leading into the game the talk had been of whitewashes and rankings. A clean sweep and England would have soared so rapidly up the world rankings, to the lofty and unusual heights of second place, that oxygen and sherpas might have been required.</p> <p>As it is, they must settle for good progress and third place. Perhaps this is no bad thing, for there was a danger of getting things out of proportion. England's undoubted improvement under Pietersen's leadership needs to be offset against mentally tired and physically drained opponents who, ever since their well-deserved triumph in the Test series, have arrived at matches with half an eye on the calendar and the departures lounge. A rankings system that on the back of one successful series can see a team leapfrog another who have hammered them in both previous series needs to be regarded with some scepticism.</p> <p>So too does a system where overs are recalculated in one-day cricket without due regard to common sense. A glance at the Met Office rainfall radar would have shown the likelihood of further interruptions and as such a sensible approach would have been to settle on a realistic length of game given the circumstances. In truth there was never much chance of a full match but they never really gave it the best chance.</p> <p>While the groundstaff proceeded diligently with their futile mopping operations, Pietersen was to be seen leaning on the railings of the dressing-room balcony, a rueful look on his face. Best, though, to be philosophical, for in a short space of time he has managed through personality and sound cricket thinking to turn round a mediocre team and make it into a competitive one. In doing so, he has taken much of the heat from the coach, Peter Moores, who has managed to blend nicely (and no doubt gratefully) into the background.</p> <p>In this Pietersen has been helped by the return to fitness and form of Andrew Flintoff, the undisputed man of the series, and by the resurgence of Steve Harmison, whose one-day renaissance has been down as much to Pietersen's persuasive powers as anything.</p> <p>The captain knows what he wants and, as shown by his attempts to sweet-talk Marcus Trescothick back into international cricket, he will do all he can to get it. His faith in players - Owais Shah at No3, Flintoff at No5, Ian Bell at the top of the order - is manifest and they appear to have responded to this.</p> <p>His acquisition of a pace quartet to match any, with potential back-up from Ryan Sidebottom, has played a large part but that is down to good fortune: his predecessor, Paul Collingwood, never had such resources at his disposal. There is a good way to go, however, before England can be certain of their new status. Their results over the years have always been better at home than abroad, which is hardly surprising, although they had outstanding wins in Sri Lanka last winter and in Australia the winter before.</p> <p>And what they have now is a side admirably suited to home conditions where the seamers generally hold sway on pitches that have some pace and carry. The real test for this new side will come in the course of seven matches in India at the end of the year.</p> <p>There, on sluggish pitches, spinners rather than wrecking balls boss the middle overs, while the capacity of seamers to take the pace from the ball is crucial. The side would become unbalanced if, say, the offspinner Graeme Swann replaced Luke Wright, with a hard hitter disappearing from the later order. Or if Swann replaced Jimmy Anderson, a bowler capable of swinging the new ball, a crucial element on the subcontinent would have gone. Maybe it is Harmison who would make way.</p> <p>Ultimately, success, particularly in one-day cricket, will come in the development of a squad capable of adapting to all conditions and circumstances. One size does not fit all.</p>",
  "<p>Australians still grumble about being sacrificed to Winston Churchill's vaulting ambition at Gallipoli 93 years ago. It may take them a few generations to work through falling victim to Marcus Trescothick's mints in the Ashes of 2005.</p> <p>Yet the story came in the nick of time. Great Britain's successes in the Games of the 29th Olympiad were vexing. They were attributable mainly, of course, to the unfair advantage of performance-enhancing money - Australian athletes, by contrast, are roused merely by sun, surf and a whiff of Vegemite. And, well, Great Britain - what's that? A transparent attempt to align England to those famous Olympic powerhouses of Scotland and Wales. All the same, could that traditional and comforting Australia edge in sporting prowess really have narrowed so sharply?</p> <p>Then along comes Trescothick, apparently revealing that England's very temporary custody of the Ashes was obtained by sugary spit of mouth rather than salty sweat of brow. Rupert Murdoch's Australian, which can always be relied on for sober and dispassionate coverage of cricket issues, laid it out with typical restraint: \"The secret behind the devastating swing bowling that took England to its historic 2005 Ashes win has been revealed. They cheated.\" What a relief for the country to be confirmed in its most deeply embedded prejudices - that any English ascendancy, however brief, must be an outcome of trickery or luck.</p> <p>Naturally, the story is slightly more ambiguous. Trescothick says he put Murray Mints to use because they stimulated most saliva, and saliva is not on anyone's banned substance list. He sucked them throughout the 2001 Ashes series when England's bowlers achieved uncanny standards of accuracy, finding the middle of Australian bats with monotonous regularity.</p> <p>Nor where professional ethics are concerned do Australians have much to learn. For example, in his new instructional book, If Better Is Possible, Australia's most successful coach, John Buchanan, shares his battle plan for last year's World Cup. Among the frankly expressed objectives: \"Bowlers must position themselves in their follow-through wherever possible to force batsmen to run around them.\" Let's just say that this doesn't reconcile easily with Law 42.5 which states that \"it is unfair for any member of the fielding side, by word or action, willfully to attempt to distract or obstruct either batsman after the striker has received the ball\". Obviously, too, Buchanan does not have nearly so effective a publicist as Trescothick.</p> <p>Of Trescothick's admission, meanwhile, one of those mysterious \"ICC spokesmen\", never named and never accountable, informed the BBC: \"According to the laws this is illegal.\" This being the same ICC that not so long ago retrospectively altered the result of the Oval Test of 2006 in the face of the apparently unambiguous Law 21.10: \"Once the umpires have agreed with the scorers the correctness of the scores at the conclusion of the match ... the result cannot thereafter be changed\". What with the steady pervasion of cricket by technology, we are working steadily towards that vision recommended for Roses matches of the 1920s by the Lancashire bowler Dick Tyldesley: \"What we need is no oompires and fair cheatin' all around.\"</p> <p>In this instance, however, the Laws of Cricket are secondary to the opportunity they afford for the atavistic pleasure of sledging the Poms - and it's kind of reassuring that this remains in Australia a source of such seditious merriment. You might imagine that a grown-up relationship between England and Australia would result in less puerile point-scoring; but it's precisely because the relationship is so mature that it permits such harmless silliness. In fact, in this era of instant umbrage, it seems an almost unseemly luxury to be able to diss any country, and an act of delicious fun to give it back. What Australia's longest-serving prime minister Sir Robert Menzies observed in Wisden a generation ago regarding relations between England and Australia still holds true: \"We know each other so well that, thank heaven, we don't have to be too tactful with each other.\"</p> <p><strong>Olympic incentive for Australian girl power</strong></p> <p>Now Australia's successful Olympians have been safely hawked to reality and lifestyle television, and the failures have been held up to the equally traditional odium and ridicule, the \"lessons\" of the Games are being debated. One widely noted phenomenon, especially in the pool, was the success of women comparative to men: until the last few days, the female of the species was considerably deadlier than the male.</p> <p>Mind you, this continued a trend rather than forming a new one. Up to and including Barcelona, women had provided 40% of Australian medals while constituting only a fifth of Australian athletes. It's arguable, in fact, that Australia's famous sportsmindedness actually militates against an abundance of top-flight male Olympians. The big sports fill big quotas. Finding the critical mass of elite male athletes to compose a competitive Olympic contingent depends on making the best of those who either did not like or could not cut Aussie rules football, the rugby codes, tennis and soccer. Australian athletics' new poster boy Steve Hooker, for example, grew up wanting to play Aussie rules for Carlton - his hair also suggests aspirations to succeed the lead singer of REO Speedwagon. He only tackled pole vaulting 11 years ago because it \"looked like fun\" when his football ambitions were thwarted.</p> <p>If this is so, and because there are fewer other opportunities for women to excel in sport before a mass audience, it may be that Australia's female athletes will inevitably give a better account of themselves at Olympics, setting up an interesting tension in a country where sport is often regarded as an unassailable bastion of the white male monoculture.</p> <p><strong>Surly Symonds the one that got away</strong></p> <p>Officially Andrew Symonds is to do a month's penance for going fishing instead of attending a team meeting ahead of Australia's three perfunctory one-day internationals against Bangladesh. Truth is that Symonds, a super cricketer, is also a surly boor, who has finally even alienated forbearing colleagues.</p> <p>Thus have been revealed the true colours of antagonists at the centre of the on-field incident eight months ago that threatened to split the cricket world, the men with whom administrators stood shoulder-to-shoulder in the conviction that they could not possibly be at fault: first Harbhajan Singh, a juvenile smart-arse, was suspended during the IPL for slapping similarly excitable countryman Shantakumaran Sreesanth; now Symonds, an arrogant bonehead, has been invited to reflect on his insouciance. One wonders whether events might have played out differently had the ICC referee Mike Procter done his job in January and simply suspended both players for their contrived and unnecessary altercation, instead of allowing so much racial hay to be made. Instead, it has been disrespect to team-mates that has finally undone both men. That, at least, remains a taboo - maybe, in cricket, the last remaining.</p> <p><strong>Business as usual at UK Athletics </strong></p> <p>Great Britain to sack UK Athletics performance director. Full review. Sweeping changes. New man said to have \"no-nonsense approach\". More discipline. More accountability. Sack this sorry lot and choose a bunch of kids. Now, that's more like the England that Australians recognise - pleased to see it hasn't died out entirely.</p> <p>Lawrence Donegan returns next week</p>",
  "<p>A Photoshopped picture of Sarah Palin has been doing the rounds for the past few days; it shows her in a stars and stripes bikini toting a rifle - patriotism, hunting and cheesecake all combined in one image. Two minutes of Googling reveals that the rifle has been identified by gun nuts in Republican chatrooms as a Crossman pump pellet gun. Soft porn for rednecks. Expect to see it pinned to the wall in every gas station in Texas and tacked to the dashboard of every long-haul truck. But this cartoon-like depiction of her smothers what we need to understand about why Palin appeals to American voters and why American elections have been so deadlocked for the past decade, as if there were two Americas, doomed to lived on the same landmass under the same government, like hopelessly incompatible spouses.</p> <p>A new novel, American Wife by Curtis Sittenfeld, published in the US this week, tells a fictionalised and thinly veiled story of Laura Bush, from small-town girl in the 1950s midwest to school librarian to Republican bride to President's wife. What you learn from the novel is that, like it or not, the American heartland is not so much a political ideology but an actual place with people living in it. Small-town Americans have values and a lot of those values are good ones: neighbourliness, family life, a knowledge of the land and what grows in it. The other America they see on TV seems without ethics - crime, violence, drug addiction, pornography and prostitution - and they don't want any part of it.</p> <p>So clear is the divide between big-city and small-town America that one American friend said to me: \"These whitebread Republicans are like children - someone has to tell them what to do and what to think, they're incapable of independent ideas.\" </p> <p>The conviction by the left that the right is stupid is one of the defining and least attractive characteristics of contemporary politics. Assuming that anyone who disagrees with you is too dim to get your point is not itself a particularly brainy way to win others over to the essential correctness of your views. But it is true that to small-town Republicans the world is not a complicated place, because they have seen so little of it. </p> <p>I asked a sophisticated and well-travelled Republican why he voted the way he did. He described growing up \"dirt poor\" in a small town in Northern California where joining the military was your sole ticket out; where the people in his family who depended on welfare stayed where they were and the ones who worked their fingers to the bone managed to make a better life for themselves. For him, joining the army led directly to an education. In fact, it led all the way to Princeton. But how, I asked him, baffled, could someone as intelligent as he is believe that George W Bush was anything but a cretin? </p> <p>Because, he explained, people in small towns don't like or trust intellectuals, particularly ones who appear to be sneering at them for their supposed stupidity. They admire a plain-speaking man; it's what they know and what they are used to. </p> <p>They always assumed Bush was a regular guy who could keep his thoughts concise. </p> <p>So America is stuck. Two countries, mutually irreconcilable, who never meet each other and don't want to, either. Who distrust each other at best, despise each other at worst. And who have absolutely no understanding of the other. </p> <p>Reading Sittenfeld's thinly disguised account of Laura Bush and her upbringing, it was possible to see that the modest lives of her midwestern characters both had dignity and made sense. But I only have to meet them in a novel, which I can snap shut as soon as I've finished it. Were I an East Coast Democrat, which is the only kind of American I can ever imagine being, I would have no objection to small-town Republicans - to their church-going and their hunting rifles and their flag-decked porches and their meatloaf with gravy, and their lemon chiffon cake. I could admire their intimacy with the wide prairie and the vast sky. </p> <p>The problem is that when they're running the whole country, they want to take away abortion rights, drill for oil in Alaska (a Palin policy), ignore climate change, and start unwinnable wars. With the small-town Republican mindset in charge, the rest of America and the rest of the world is forced to live by small-town values, which aren't much help when you're trying to decide what, if anything, can be done about Iranian nuclear ambitions or more humbly, workplace date rape. </p> <p>Can America survive another photo-finish election which the Republicans win, or will it be out and out war between the red and the blue states? Perhaps only small-town America itself can prevent it, such as the dental nurse who asked how the mother of five kids, one with Down's syndrome, could hold down a full-time job, one step from running the United States. Sarah Palin, bad mom. That might finish her.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>This week Linda witnessed the end of the months-long <strong>Desperate Housewives</strong> drought when it at last returned to Channel 4 on Wednesday: \"I survived in the meantime with the theme tune as my mobile-phone ringtone.\" She finally saw, almost a year after everyone else, <strong>The Band's Visit</strong>: \"A film that quietly rejoices in the absurdity of human nature.\"</p>",
  "<p>As one of the games industry's colossi, you'd expect Will Wright's latest game to be epic, but Spore is more ambitious in its scope than any game ever: he could have called it Sim Universe. Spore is essentially five games in one, with stages titled Cell, Creature, Tribal, Civilisation and Space. Inspired by the 1977 Eames film Powers of Ten, it starts you off gently by giving you control of a single-cell organism, which you evolve until it can leave the sea and walk up the beach. The Creature phase is the one that has generated the most publicity: it allows you to design an organism from scratch - although, in truth, aesthetic whims are less of a priority than making use of the body parts you acquire with their attendant properties. Evolve sentience and you must attempt to dominate an area of your planet in the Tribal stage; once you dominate a planet in Civilisation, you can head off to the stars for some surprisingly relevant (in these days of global warming) terraforming. Spore's best phases are Creature, Tribal and Space - Civilisation is too dependent on manic activity when you first start playing it. But the consistency between phases (the scope alters, but basic gameplay principles, such as the option to play aggressively or diplomatically, still apply) is stunning, the whole experience feels thoroughly fresh and innovative, and you will want to replay it several times. Essential.</p>",
  "<p>J\u00e9r\u00f4me Kerviel, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale's alleged rogue trader, appeared before a Paris court yesterday, backed by a revamped defence team ready to go on the offensive to try to prove that the bank's management knew what he was doing. In January SocGen revealed record losses of \u20ac4.9bn (\u00a33.9bn), which it said were caused by the junior trader's unauthorised deals.</p> <p>Kerviel did not comment as he entered the Paris financial court to be questioned alongside his former aide for the first time. Thomas Mougard, 24, is under formal investigation for complicity in introducing fraudulent data into a computer system. He denies the accusations, arguing he was not aware of the illicit nature of the transactions he was asked to carry out.</p> <p>Kerviel is under formal investigation for breach of trust, computer abuse and falsification of documents. He has admitted building up non-authorised trading positions, but has argued his supervisors turned a blind eye.</p> <p>Before the hearing his new defence team made it clear it intended to implicate Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale directly in the affair. According to one of his lawyers, they have evidence that some among the bank's hierarchy knew about the illicit nature of his transactions, an accusation SocGen has always strongly denied.</p> <p>\"The bank knew in detail about J\u00e9r\u00f4me Kerviel's activities; a connivance that could go as far as complicity,\" one of the lawyers, Bernard Benaiem, told France Info radio. \"We want to show that these elements of complicity will show this affair in an entirely new light.\"</p> <p>It is claimed that emails exchanged between SocGen's financial controllers showed they were aware as early as spring 2007 about the fictitious nature of some of his transactions. </p> <p>The lawyers have also mentioned a report by the French Banking Commission, which fined the bank \u20ac4m in July after uncovering \"grave deficiencies\" in SocGen's internal controls. Only the conclusions were made public, but Kerviel's lawyers argue the main part of the report backs their case. </p> <p>Independent investigations and the bank's own internal inquiries into the scandal have found that its managers and control systems failed to operate properly and ignored warnings. In May, SocGen's directors accused managers of negligence and said his direct supervisor had been too tolerant of Kerviel's activities. A report by PricewaterhouseCoopers blamed the \"culture\" at the Delta One trading desk, describing it as \"overheated\", where activities got out of hand.</p> <p>But so far no one has actually gone so far as to claim that the bank knew about what was actually happening. By aiming to prove that it did, Kerviel's legal team is hoping to put the bank on the defensive. Lawyers could demand further investigations, which could set back further a case which already looks set to run for years.</p> <p>The defence also intends to put the spotlight on the events of last January, arguing that SocGen, not Kerviel, was responsible for the bank's colossal losses, by liquidating his transactions amid turmoil on the world's markets.</p>",
  "<p>Wild cheers often fill the Target Centre in Minneapolis, home to the Minnesota Timberwolves basketball team. Until this week, though, it hadn't usually been because someone had urged the crowd to unite to fight the secret government plan to merge the United States, Canada and Mexico into a single entity, or because they'd mentioned the name of the economist Friedrich Hayek. </p> <p>But these were regular occurrences at the Rally For The Republic, a libertarian counter-convention held just across the river from the official one by the former Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul. A crowd that organisers estimated at 10,000 screamed and clapped as conservative heroes such as Barry Goldwater and Jesse Ventura took the stage.</p> <p>These were dark times for America - \"the future of the Republic is bleak\", Paul himself warned in a speech during the 10-hour proceedings. But there was solace in coming together to plot the revolution.</p> <p>Exactly what that revolution might entail, though, was unclear. Paul supports what he sees as a strict return to America's constitution, including the abolition of federal income taxes, the Federal Reserve, and most departments of the US government. But his is also an exceptionally broad church. </p> <p>The cable news host Tucker Carlson, who introduced the day's events, remembered first meeting the Texas congressman: \"I didn't agree with his whole outlook,\" he said, \"but he didn't care. He was completely uninterested in having me, or anyone else, sign up to a 30-point programme that was in effect a cult of personality.\"</p> <p>If anything, Paul's is a cult of no personality: the 73-year-old is a diminutive, avuncular presence, courteous without being overly warm, a vessel for his supporters' varying preoccupations. \"People talk about a big tent,\" one supporter said, \"but Ron Paul has taken a razor blade and cut the tent wide open.\"</p> <p>This is one reason why his presidential bid proved a surprise phenomenon, using a well-organised internet campaign to rouse independent-minded voters disaffected with both major parties. But for liberals, discussions with Paul and his supporters are disorienting. They are opposed to the war in Iraq, and to government invasions of privacy, and to the unfettered power of corporations. On the other hand, they oppose gun control, government welfare, abortion, most taxes, and the United Nations - some suspect 9/11 was a US government conspiracy.</p> <p>\"Most of America doesn't really understand the issues the way Ron Paul supporters do, so a lot of them think we're nuts or just extreme,\" said Drew Delavera, a young former Republican from Florida. \"But if they took the time to read the constitution, they'd see we're not so nutty. They'd see we're just going back to the basics.\" </p> <p>To drive home the point, supporters at the rally handed out copies of the Bill of Rights; some wore costumes of the American revolutionary era. (\"No offence,\" said one, Tim Smith, on being questioned in an English accent.)</p> <p>Paul won only a handful of delegates to the official Republican convention, and says the party refused to give him proper access credentials. </p> <p>Not that he seemed to care much: \"I think the two parties have blended together, over many years,\" he told the Guardian. (\"Even Bill Clinton was a more conservative president than George Bush,\" said Howard Phillips, chair of the Conservative Caucus, who spoke at the rally.) </p> <p>Some supporters argued that his defeat in the primaries actually helped. \"If we had sent Ron Paul to Washington, he would still have had to battle the machine of everyone else,\" said Jennifer Riley, from North Dakota. The very-big-tent approach has attracted controversy: Paul was forced to dissociate himself from racist statements contained in newsletters issued under his name, and he refused to return money donated by a supporter with connections to a white supremacist group. </p> <p>\"If somebody sends me money and has a weird belief and I didn't know about it, I don't see that as a big deal,\" he said. \"If they're bad people, why should I give them back their money?

  "<p>British forces pulled off an epic mission to deliver a 200-tonne turbine to a dam in the heart of Taliban territory in Helmand, but the $100m project must overcome serious obstacles before it can improve the lives of local Afghans, security analysts said yesterday.</p> <p>Nearly 5,000 troops were involved in the operation to bring the turbine and other machinery through 100 miles of insurgent strongholds to the village of Kajaki, where it will be used to refurbish an ageing hydroelectric dam.</p> <p>However, engineers predict it will take months before the dam is running at full capacity, and it will be at least two years before the electricity it generates reaches the 1.8 million intended beneficiaries, who live in remote villages in the Helmand river valley. </p> <p>Even then, electricity supplies are likely to face disruption from Taliban attacks unless the region is cleared of militants, analysts said.</p> <p>The area is not densely populated, so the power lines must cover many miles of hostile land to reach the remote villages that are due to be linked up to the dam. British troops in Helmand control an area of only a few miles radius beyond the Kajaki dam, so pylons and substations will have to cross what is now a stronghold for militants operating in the region. </p> <p>\"The power lines coming out of Kajaki are going to be extremely vulnerable to attack,\" said Matthew Clements, Eurasia analyst at Jane's Defence. \"The arrival of the extra turbine is a major blow to the Taliban, so they are going to be keen to make sure the project fails.\"</p> <p>Last year, at least 700 Taliban fighters crossed from Pakistan into Afghanistan to reinforce insurgents attacking the Kajaki dam. The attacks followed operations by Nato-led troops to allow reconstruction of the dam and the power transmission lines to boost output after fighting halted refurbishment in 2006.</p> <p>The Kajaki hydroelectric power plant was built with funding from US development aid in 1975. At full capacity, it can deliver 53MW of power and provide water for crop irrigation, but with only one turbine now working, it can only produce 16MW. A second turbine broke down six months ago and is awaiting spare parts. The third, a Chinese turbine, will add a further 18.9MW of power.</p> <p>Fitting the new turbine will take many months, requiring heavy lifting cranes to shift the equipment. Once in place, a generator must be installed above it, all under clean conditions that prevent grit and sediments from the dam's reservoir clogging up the machinery. </p> <p>The power station is connected to Helmand's provincial capital, Lashkar Gah, by a single main power line, but engineers plan to put in $77m of new transmission lines to connect up villages in the rest of the province. </p> <p>\"In Iraq we've seen that overhead power lines are extremely difficult to protect, and there's no point generating electricity if you can't distribute it,\" said Paul Smyth, head of operational studies at the Royal United Services Institute for Defence Studies. </p> <p>The military convoy arrived on Tuesday bearing seven 25-tonne sections of machinery. The route passed through territory that has been held by the Taliban for two years, and was cleared by engineers who removed improvised explosives and strengthened the road. </p> <p>The US-led coalition has said it killed 220 militants in Helmand province over the last week, coinciding with the turbine's movement through the region. </p> <p>Brigadier Mark Carleton-Smith, commander of British forces in Afghanistan, emphasised that it would take time to connect up homes that are currently without power. \"It's going to take a lot more investment and considerably more time and energy from the international community,\" he said. \"If we're not firm in our commitment, that will resonate negatively with the Afghan civilian population.\"</p> <p>The elaborate mission to deliver the third turbine to Kajaki suggests the military intention is to get the power plant up and running at full capacity in the hope that the security situation has improved by the time the new electric cables are ready to be put in place.</p> <p>\"The fact that they've been able to move this convoy through 180 miles safely already says a lot about what the military forces are able to do and what the insurgents are not able to do,\" said Smyth.</p> <p>\"This is not just about providing people with power. It's important for people there to see that life is better under the Afghan government than it is under the insurgents. </p> <p>\"In terms of its potential to give them electricity, to irrigate their land, and even think of having cottage industries, it could have a great effect on their lives.\"</p>",
  "<p>Kevin Keegan has effectively challenged Mike Ashley either to dismiss him or redefine Dennis Wise's role at Newcastle United. As the impasse over the manager's uncertain future continued yesterday a source close to him indicated that he wanted full control of all transfer activity: \"Kevin still wants the job, make no mistake about that - but he would like to be able to buy his own players.\"</p> <p>It was thought Keegan had been sacked by Ashley, Newcastle's billionaire owner, after bitter rows with Wise, the club's director of football and with Derek Llambias, the managing director, on Tuesday. But after hours of silence the club eventually released a statement insisting this was not the case.</p> <p>The Newcastle players are understood to be furious with the handling of the saga and it is expected that a player delegation led by Michael Owen will demand answers from the board about Keegan's future. The squad are said to be behind Keegan and would not want Wise - who ideally Keegan would like to see removed from his role - to take over as manager.</p> <p>With Keegan seemingly refusing to resign and the club declining to dismiss him, he retreated to the north-west where he has a house in Hale, Cheshire. The former England coach spent Tuesday evening consulting his lawyers in a Manchester hotel and discussing his position with the League Managers Association, then failed to supervise training for the second consecutive day yesterday.</p> <p>A St James' Park spokesman released a mid-morning statement saying: \"Newcastle United football club can confirm that discussions are ongoing between the board and Kevin Keegan. Both the club and Kevin would like to reiterate that Kevin remains as manager. He has not resigned nor has he been sacked.\"</p> <p>Yesterday's Newcastle Evening Chronicle contained an interview with the aforementioned source \"close to\" Keegan. After insisting that the manager wanted autonomy over transfers - something precluded by the continental managerial structure introduced by Ashley at St James' - the source argued the case for a policy change, explaining: \"If Kevin was allowed to bring in his own players and failed he would be the first to hold his hands up. But he has always bought flair players who get people off their seats.\"</p> <p>Reports last night went as far as to say Keegan had sent Ashley a letter through his legal advisers demanding control of all first-team affairs and contracts and the removal of Wise and Tony Jimenez, the vice president (player recruitment).</p> <p>Wise's control of transfers has long been a bone of contention and this week's upset was sparked by the board's failed attempts to sell Owen and Joey Barton before the transfer deadline. However, handing control to Keegan would necessitate the removal or demotion of Wise, who earns \u00a31.5m a year and is close to Ashley.</p> <p>Matters are further complicated by the fact that Keegan is believed to have demanded \u00a38m in compensation for the remaining three years of his Newcastle contract. He remains adamant he will not resign and it has been reported that, under the terms of his contract, walking away would leave him liable to pay back more than \u00a31m to Ashley. Yet if Ashley continues to refuse to sack Keegan while preserving Wise's position and powers, the manager could launch a legal claim for constructive dismissal. With spiky Newcastle fans waving banners demanding that Keegan stays and calling for the departures of both Wise and the club's owner, the suddenly deeply unpopular, and reportedly shocked, Ashley has some major decisions to make.</p>",

  "<p>Hey, rock and roll: I just had the most amazing web experience. Yes, friends, I registered my small business to pay its VAT online. OK, I should get out more, but stay with me: VAT is a key milestone on my road to e-citizenry. For years I've cited it as an example of a transaction not worth doing electronically. My little company's quarterly paper form takes only minutes to fill out. Of course, the VAT people then have to process my handwriting, but that's their problem.</p> <p>No more. What swung me was trying out <a href=\"http://businesslink.gov.uk\">businesslink.gov.uk,</a> the government's all-purpose portal for transactions with business. It's one of the trio of megasites destined to take on nearly all official transactions in the name of joined-up public services and, in theory, lower costs. (The other two are <a href=\"http://direct.gov.uk\">direct.gov.uk</a> for citizens' transactions and <a href=\"http://nhs.uk\">nhs.uk</a> for healthcare.)</p> <p>Of the three, Businesslink has the strongest case. Businesses are more likely than citizens to be equipped to transact electronically with government, so an e-service is likely to reach a critical mass of users more quickly. Digital exclusion is nothing like the concern it is with private citizens and NHS users; neither is privacy. And if you ask proprietors whether they would rather deal with officialdom through a single web portal or through separate relationships with a dozen different agencies, the answer will be pretty clearcut.</p> <p>A single Businesslink service illustrates the possibilities. Namecheck allows entrepreneurs to check new business and brand names simultaneously against registers in Companies House and the Intellectual Property Office, cutting in half the time needed. As Businesslink is supposed to absorb material from more than 160 other government websites by April 2011, there's plenty of room for more such rationalisation.</p> <p>However, because this is a clunking great government IT project, there is also room for concern. First, even if everyone agrees with the theory of providing a one-stop shop, it'll be a hard slog persuading individual state agencies to hand over their key functions. Directgov has a similar problem, but Businesslink has the special difficulty of extracting web content and commitment from bodies that may lack resources to cooperate. Links with local councils - responsible for licensing, public health and many other areas of business regulation - pose their own set of problems.</p> <p>A second concern is Businesslink's place in the \"gov 2.0\" programme launched by last year's Power of Information report. Unlike its NHS counterpart, user-generated content is not an integral part of the Businesslink programme. Its owner, HM Revenue and Customs, doesn't seem enthusiastic about sponsoring wikis for businesspeople to exchange ideas for tax-dodging. Possibly that will change as the web 2.0 philosophy percolates through Whitehall. But then we'll have a new set of worries, to do with competition with commercial sites and social communities which might have ambitions to set up their own portals.</p> <p>Finally, there is Businesslink's own business plan. The site is outsourced; run by the Serco Group under a contract agreed in 2005. While the contractor seems to be making a fair fist of the job, the government needs to ensure that it keeps a grip on the project and that the costs - \u00a335m a year - are recouped from savings elsewhere.</p> <p>All these factors seem to merit more external scrutiny than the service gets. It is possible that Businesslink is an example of Whitehall finally getting e-government right, but some independent confirmation would be nice.</p>",
  "<p>One of the world's leading climate scientists yesterday called for an immediate halt to the building of all coal-fired power stations to prevent catastrophic global warming.</p> <p>James Hansen, a former White House adviser and Al Gore's science adviser, giving evidence in a British court, said sticking to a \"business as usual\" approach would see the planet passing its climate change tipping point.</p> <p>Hansen was giving evidence in the case of six Greenpeace supporters charged with causing \u00a330,000 of criminal damage when scaling the 200-metre Kingsnorth power station chimney in Kent last October.</p> <p>The group admit causing the damage when painting the name \"Gordon\" on the chimney but argue that they were acting legitimately to prevent widespread climate change. The prosecution claims the group went beyond the bounds of acceptable protest.</p> <p>Asked what his message to Gordon Brown would be, Hansen said: \"I would ask him to make a clear public statement for a moratorium on new coal-fired power plants that do not capture CO2. There is enough potential in renewables for our energy requirements. The moratorium should be immediate. We do not need new coal-fired power plants. They all need to be phased out over the next 20 years.\"</p> <p>Hansen, director of the Nasa Goddard Institute for Space Studies and a professor at Columbia University, said the man-made rate of change of atmospheric CO2 was 10,000 times greater than natural.</p> <p>He warned that 1m species would be made extinct because of climate change and calculated that Kingsnorth, which emits 20,000 tonnes of CO2 a day, would be responsible for 400 of these. He told the jury that sea levels were rising at a rate of 3cm per decade, twice as much as the rate in the 20th century. \"[If nothing is done] we would be handing our children, our grandchildren and the unborn, a situation that would be out of their control\".</p> <p>He said he agreed with Al Gore's statement that more people should be chaining themselves to coal-powered stations.</p> <p>Tackling the issue of why one UK plant was so important, when China and India were building large numbers of plants, he said the UK, US and Germany were most responsible for today's climate change on a per capita basis. He said: \"We have to get the rest of the world to cooperate but somebody has to take the lead.\"</p> <p>The case continues.</p>",
  "<p>In a week when the checkout tills in football's transfer market rang up almost as many noughts as a bill in a Zimbabwean restaurant, Northampton are proof that in rugby, money does not guarantee success. The Saints return to Guinness Premiership action against Worcester at Franklin's Gardens on Sunday, chastened by a year in National League One.</p> <p>Northampton have spent big on and off the field in the past decade, but their policy of importing players from overseas rather than signing England internationals, who would be missing for a significant part of the season because of Test commitments, led two seasons ago to a collapse of team spirit, not least because some of those signings struggled to cope with the attritional nature of the Premiership. Relegation ensued.</p> <p>Promotion having been secured at the first attempt, the English rose is in bloom at Franklin's Gardens again. Jim Mallinder and Dorian West, previously in charge of England's Under-21s, were brought in as coaches as Northampton looked to tap into their knowledge of emerging players in the country. This summer has seen a number of English players recruited, including the scrum-half Ben Foden, one of four men signed from Mallinder's former club, Sale, along with the head of performance, Nick Johnston.</p> <p>\"The players say this has been the hardest pre-season they have known and it has had to be that way,\" said Mallinder. \"The bottom line is that we were not good enough to play in the Premiership last season. We did quite well in the first division, but we only had to achieve a certain level of fitness and the players have had to have a reality check in pre-season. They know the next nine months are going to be completely different. We are not where we want to be, but we are going in the right direction. They've responded brilliantly, coming in early and working doubly hard. Nick's changed a lot of things off the field and I have been delighted with the reaction of all the squad, young and old.\"</p> <p>The Saints are not the bookmakers' favourites to go down: Newcastle, who host Northampton on the second league weekend, are most fancied for the drop in a season when there is no obvious fall guy. However, a poll on a local website saw 30% of respondents tip Mallinder's men to finish in the bottom two. Memories are evidently still vivid of two seasons ago, when despite picking from a squad which included Bruce Reihana, Carlos Spencer, Mark Robinson, Ben Cohen and Tom Smith, Northampton finished bottom.</p> <p>\"We went down for a reason,\" said Reihana, the club captain. \"The bottom line was that we lost too many matches. Fingers were pointed at things that were not really there and while we searched for answers, we did not find many. We learned a lot last year and we return to the Premiership a stronger club on and off the pitch. I am positive about what lies ahead of us.\"</p> <p>Reihana, along with Spencer, stayed at Northampton even though the two New Zealand internationals had not envisaged playing second division rugby when they moved to England. \"I was part of the team which went down and I wanted to help the club get back up straight away, rather than run away,\" said Reihana. \"Jim and Dorian came in, things have turned around and we have a bright future.\"</p> <p>Northampton signed 12 players in the summer, including the Ireland back-rowers Neil Best and Roger Wilson from Ulster, the Argentina second-row Ignacio Fern\u00e1ndez Lobbe from Sale and Foden, who left the Stockport-based club because he wanted to play at scrum-half rather than full-back. The England management will be monitoring the progress of the hooker Dylan Hartley, who toured New Zealand with the national side in the summer without tasting any action, and the 21-year-old former Wigan rugby league wing Chris Ashton, who scored 41 tries for Saints last season.</p> <p>\"What we've looked for is a bit of experience and up and coming lads who've got something to build and points to make,\" said Mallinder. \"We had fantastic support home and away last season despite being in the first division and we want to give our supporters something to cheer. It was good for us to have a year in the first division. It gave us a bit of time to develop our own culture and a style of play we are comfortable with. The first five league games are vital. We have Worcester first up and will put everything into that. At the end of the month we will reassess and see where we are.\"</p>",

  "<p>A galloping horse in a confined space is an unbelievable experience. It is so loud and smelly - it's like an assault on the senses. I took this picture in 1998, when I was really broke. It comes from the second story I did for Sleazenation fashion magazine, looking at motion going nowhere.</p> <p>It sounds very arrogant, but at the time I thought: \"Ah, this is really something fresh in fashion photography. It's its own thing.\" Of course, it barely counts as fashion photography. There is no fashion in it, although we did give a credit to Herm\u00e8s for the blanket on the horse. I shot it in Newmarket, at the Animal Health Trust, which is quite a sophisticated facility: they put racehorses on this machine, take them up to a gallop, and test them physiologically. I worked with a stylist, who gave one of the assistants something to wear, and put the Herm\u00e8s blanket on the horse. It was quite a serious racehorse, so I was worried about it getting scared by the flash and injuring itself. Luckily, it wasn't bothered in the slightest. </p> <p>However, I just didn't get the shot. So I had to do it again. And then the second time, the stylist, who was also starting out, just couldn't get the time off from his painting and decorating job. So I had to go and do it on my own, and that's why the women are just dressed in their usual gear. I might have told them to change things slightly or fiddled with it a bit, but that's it.</p> <p>I remember the space was quite awkward, but in the end I moved a bit of equipment and got a spot. I was shooting with large-format film, which is expensive, so I had only 10 or 15 frames to play with and was really concentrating. But when I got it, I really felt as if I'd done something that was very much of its moment.</p> <h2>Curriculum vitae</h2> <p><strong>Born: </strong>London, 1968. </p> <p><strong>Studied: </strong>Self-taught. </p> <p><strong>Inspirations: </strong>\"Garry Winogrand, Irving Penn and Eugene Smith.

  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-337289283\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/bc/281851582/281851582_1772864322_ron-paul-last-FLV-16x9.flv\"/> </video>   <p>Wild cheers often fill the Target Centre in Minneapolis, home to the Minnesota Timberwolves basketball team. Until this week, though, it hadn't usually been because someone had urged the crowd to unite to fight the secret government plan to merge the United States, Canada and Mexico into a single entity, or because they'd mentioned the name of the economist Friedrich Hayek.</p> <p>But these were regular occurrences at the Rally For The Republic, a libertarian counter-convention held just across the river from the official one by the former Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul. A crowd that organisers estimated at 10,000 clapped and screamed as conservative heroes such as Barry Goldwater and Jesse Ventura took the stage. These were dark times for America - \"the future of the Republic is bleak,\" Paul himself warned in a speech during the 10-hour proceedings. But there was solace in coming together to plot the revolution.</p> <p>Exactly what that revolution might entail, though, was unclear. Paul supports what he sees as a strict return to America's constitution, including the abolition of federal income taxes, the Federal Reserve, and most departments of the US government. But his is also an exceptionally broad church. The cable news host Tucker Carlson, who introduced the day's events, remembered first meeting the Texan congressman: \"I didn't agree with his whole outlook,\" he said, \"but he didn't care. He was completely uninterested in having me, or anyone else, sign up to a 30-point programme that was in effect a cult of personality.\" </p> <p>If anything, Paul's is a cult of no personality: the 73-year-old is a diminutive, avuncular presence, courteous without being overly warm, a vessel for his supporters' widely varying preoccupations. \"People talk about a big tent,\" one supporter said, \"but Ron Paul has taken a razor blade and cut the tent wide open.\"</p> <p>This is one reason why his presidential bid proved a surprise phenomenon, using a well-organised internet campaign to rouse independent-minded voters disaffected with both major parties. But for liberals, discussions with Paul and his supporters are disorienting.</p> <p>They are opposed to the war in Iraq, and to government invasions of privacy, and to the unfettered power of corporations. On the other hand, they oppose gun control, government welfare, abortion, most taxes, and the United Nations; some suspect 9/11 was a US government conspiracy. </p> <p>\"Most of America doesn't really understand the issues the way Ron Paul supporters do, so a lot of them think we're nuts, or just extreme,\" said Drew Delavera, a young former Republican from Florida. \"But if they took the time to read the constitution, they'd see we're not so nutty. They'd see we're just going back to the basics.\" To drive home the point, supporters at the rally handed out copies of the Bill of Rights; some wore costumes of the American revolutionary era. </p> <p>Paul won only a handful of delegates to the official Republican convention, and says the party refused to give him proper access credentials. Not that he seemed to care much: \"I think the two parties have blended together, over many years,\" he told the Guardian. </p> <p>Some supporters argued that his defeat in the primaries actually helped. \"If we had sent Ron Paul to Washington, he would still have had to battle the machine of everyone else,\" said Jennifer Riley, from North Dakota.</p> <p>The very-big-tent approach has attracted controversy: Paul was forced to dissociate himself from racist statements contained in newsletters issued under his name, and he refused to return money donated by a supporter with connections to a white supremacist group. \"If somebody sends me money and has a weird belief and I didn't know about it, I don't see that as a big deal,\" he said. \"If they're bad people, why should I give them back their money? I'd rather see us use their money for good things.\"</p> <p>The revolutionaries had descended on Minneapolis from across the country, many travelling in bus charters known as Ronvoys; after the rally they were due to decamp to a Minnesota dairy farm for a six-day festival, Ronstock. Paul seemed quietly thrilled to be the incongruous star of the show. \"The campaign for the presidency is over, but the enthusiasm is not,\" he said. \"It has really only just begun.\"</p>",
  "<p>The launch of Google's Chrome web browser has not been as embarrassing as Apple's <a href=\"http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/technology/2007/06/12/malware_writers_may_be_delighted_with_safari_for_windows.html\">Safari for Windows</a>, but it has at least one security problem that Apple has already fixed.

  "<p>I'm totally baffled by Mitt Romney's <a href=\"http://Portal.GOPConvention2008.com/speech/details.aspx?id=35\">speech</a> to the GOP convention, which just ended. The conventioneers responded like the crocodiles being fed raw meat in the Bond flick <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070328/\">Live and Let Die</a>. But taken even on their face, his words are an indictment of the Republican party whose nomination he spent roughly $35m to win.</p> <p>He said: \"We need change all right - change from a liberal Washington to a conservative Washington! We have a prescription for every American who wants change in Washington - throw out the big government liberals and elect John McCain.\"</p> <p>But George Bush has been in the White House eight years now, and the Republican party controlled the congress from 1994 to just two years ago. The Democrats haven't done much at all since taking over in 2006.</p> <p>Romney went on to mention a series of Supreme Court decisions he denounced as \"liberal\", and yet the last two justices appointed to the court were arch-conservatives picked by Bush.</p> <p>He attacked the Democrats as a party that aims \"to grow the ranks of those who pay no taxes at all\", yet I'm one of the main planks in the Republican platform is lower taxes. Indeed, that's the one theme nearly every single speaker at the dais has riffed on.</p> <p>Romney said America needs a nation where schools and homes are \"free from promiscuity\". I'll let that statement stand on its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/02/uselections2008.republicans20084\">own</a>.</p> <p>He mocked Al Gore's private jet, rehashing a several-years old ad-hominem attack on the former VP and Nobel laureate's call for energy conservation. But I'm certain Romney didn't fly coach to St. Paul.</p> <p>Finally, maybe this is a product of my own background, but I get very nervous when I hear a politician call for the \"defeat\" of a major world religion, even when the words 'radical' and 'violent' precede and modify it.</p>",
  "<p>The billionaire tycoon and former Thai prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, the man who appeared to believe that he could buy anyone and anything \u2013 including a British premier league football team and Thai justice, is now a fugitive in the UK. He is a wanted man, facing two cases of corruption before the Thai courts, and probable extradition proceedings.</p> <p>But the anti-Thaksin movement in Thailand not only wants to prosecute the former prime minister for fraud and corruption, but is also intent on bringing down the current government in Bangkok, widely viewed as a \"proxy\" regime, composed mostly of the former prime minister's acolytes and supporters.</p> <p>Several days ago, the tenacious anti-Thaksin protest movement the PAD (People's Alliance for Democracy), seized the prime minister's office, <a href=\"http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/asiapacific/news/article_1428201.php/Thai_army_steps_in_to_restore_order_after_protest_turns_violent_\">Government House</a>, in Bangkok. </p> <p>Airports have also <a href=\"http://www.business24-7.ae/articles/2008/8/pages/touristsstrandedinphuketasthaiprotestsblockadeairport.aspx\">been disrupted</a>, hitting Thailand's tourist industry by leaving thousands of holidaymakers stranded. A frustrated prime minister, Samak Sundaravej, declared a <a href=\"http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,24284589-663,00.html\">state of emergency</a> from September 1, empowering the military to dislodge PAD protestors. The latest news is that the government has sought court orders to shut down around <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/sep/03/digitalmedia.thailand\">400 websites</a>.</p> <p>Thaksin, who dominated Thailand's politics as elected prime minister for a record five years, is now a wanted man in Bangkok. Ousted by a peaceful military coup in 2006, Thaksin opted for temporary exile in London and bought Manchester City FC. Meanwhile the deposed PM had been under investigation for fraud, corruption and tax evasion, in relation to his actions during his term of office, from 2001-6. By 2007 he had been charged with abusing his position as PM to benefit his business interests, and strengthen his near-monopoly over Thailand's telecommunications industry. </p> <p>After his wife was recently found guilty of tax evasion and sentenced to three years' imprisonment, Thaksin sensed that the Thai courts, which in the past had never dared to jail the rich and powerful, might be on the brink of establishing a new precedent. Thaksin had always denied all charges of wrongdoing, but he failed to turn up for his next court appearance and fled back to the UK, issuing a statement that the courts were biased against his family.</p> <p>This has prompted the sensational sale of Manchester City to <a href=\"http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/business/abu-dhabi-united-group-takes-over-man-city_10092161.html\">Abu Dhabi United Group</a>. It was a shrewd move, with the Football Association about to turn up the heat on whether Thaksin's role at the club fell foul of the requirements that owners and major shareholders should be deemed to be \"fit and proper persons\".</p> <p>Now Thaksin has taken a back seat, becoming honorary director, while still retaining a 30% stake in the club. At the same time he has clearly pulled off a financial coup. Given that \u00a31.2bn of his many assets had been frozen by the Thai courts in 2007, he has probably turned in a handsome profit on the sale. </p> <p>But the Thaksin legend is not just about buying football teams, TV stations and votes from poor farmers at election time. Earlier this year, several lawyers acting for Thaksin were convicted of <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7473641.stm\">trying to buy justice</a> when a cake box was discovered in the precincts of Thailand's supreme court. Inside the box, instead of a cake, were bundles of cash, worth around $60,000 (\u00a330,500).</p> <p>If the court in Bangkok convicts Thaksin of corruption in a land deal on September 17, then the attorney general in Thailand will be obliged to proceed with an extradition request. Lawyers for the deposed premier have been preparing papers for that eventuality and filing a request for political asylum.</p> <p>Before anyone begins to feel sorry for him, let us remember that any claim to be a political refugee, hounded by enemies, fails to take into account not only the unscrupulous pursuit of his business greed, but also the thousands of drug suspects affected by his infamous 2003 \"war on drugs\" \u2013 a lethal clean up campaign. At the height of his power, he incited police chiefs and governors to demonstrate rapid success rates, rather than respecting <a href=\"www.hrw.org/reports/2004/thailand0704/4.htm\">human rights</a> and the law.</p> <p>Thaksin still exercises massive influence on the current Thai government, and plots his comeback. The Thaksin legacy has polarised the nation, with most of Bangkok and the middle class wanting to see him behind bars, while the poor majority of the nation see him as the only prime minister who delivered cheap public healthcare and low-interest loans for farmers. </p> <p>In spite of a state of emergency, neither police nor military want to attack the well-connected PAD leaders and so the PM's office is still in the hands of the anti-government protestors. Thailand's coup-prone military is split between the government side, and those top generals who favour the opposition, thus neutralising each other. Some of King Bhumipol's privy councillors are also deeply opposed to Thaksin's influence on the country. </p> <p>The nation's development has been paralysed, caught between the pro-Thaksin rightwing government and the equally conservative PAD, which has metamorphosed from a populist peoples' power movement into an fanatically royalist\u2013led ideology based on the Thai trinity of nation, religion and monarchy.</p> <p>Some PAD leaders even advocate a reduction of democracy, by limiting parliament to only 30% elected by popular vote and rest appointees. Such reactionary nonsense only plays into the scheming hands of Thaksin and further cements his bonds with the common Tao \u2013 the masses.</p> <p>Until this ugly gap between the impoverished countryside and its legions of poor farmers and the huge city of Bangkok's elitist-minded urbanites is bridged, and unified, by one political movement or party, Thailand's deadlock is likely to defy all attempts to break the impasse, and Thaksin's legacy will continue haunt the nation.</p>",
  "<p>Democratic vice-presidential nominee Joe Biden said earlier this week that he and running mate Barack Obama could pursue criminal charges against the Bush administration if they are elected in November.</p> <p>Biden's comments, first reported by ABC news, attracted little notice on a day dominated by the drama surrounding his Republican counterpart, Alaska governor Sarah Palin.</p> <p>But his statements represent the Democrats' strongest vow so far this year to investigate alleged misdeeds committed during the Bush years. </p> <p>When asked during a campaign event in Deerfield Beach, Florida, whether he would \"pursue the violations that have been made against our Constitution by the present administration\", Biden <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13HbMfKTXr4\">answered in the affirmative</a>.</p> <p>\"We will not be stopped from pursuing any criminal offence that's occurred,\" he continued, going on to praise congressional committees for the deliberate pace of their inquiries into alleged Bush administration misdeeds.</p> <p>Members of Congress are \"doing the right thing, they're not making false accusations about anything \u2026 they're collecting data, subpoenaing records, they're building a file\", Biden said.</p> <p>\"If there has been a basis upon which you can pursue someone for a criminal violation, they will be pursued \u2013 not out of vengeance, not out of retribution, out of the need to preserve the notion that no one, no attorney general, no president -- no one is above the law.\"</p> <p>Obama sounded a similar note in April, vowing that if elected, he would ask his attorney general to initiate a prompt review of Bush-era actions to distinguish between possible \"genuine crimes\" and \"really bad policies\".</p> <p>\"[I]f crimes have been committed, they should be investigated,\" Obama told the Philadelphia Daily News. \"You're also right that I would not want my first term consumed by what was perceived on the part of Republicans as a partisan witch hunt, because I think we've got too many problems we've got to solve.\"</p> <p>When asked about his comments by Fox news today, Biden said he has no evidence that criminal charges would be warranted and no intention of pursuing action against the current president.</p> <p>\"What is true is the United States Congress is trying to preserve records on questions that relate to whether or not the law has been violated by anyone,\" Biden said, adding: \"But, you know, there's been an awful lot of unsavoury stuff that's gone on. And the mere fact \u2026 that it occurred in a previous administration doesn't mean [a subsequent] Justice Department, if, in fact, there's evidence, shouldn't pursue them. \"But I have no evidence of any of that. No one's talking about pursuing President Bush criminally.\"</p> <p>Congressional Democrats have issued a flurry of subpoenas this year to senior Bush administration aides as part of a broad inquiry into the authorisation of torturous interrogation tactics used at the Guantanamo Bay prison camp. </p> <p>Three Bush White House veterans have been held in criminal contempt of congressional committees for refusing to respond to subpoenas in an inquiry on the firing of federal prosecutors: former counsel Harriet Miers, former political adviser Karl Rove, and current chief of staff Josh Bolten. The battle over Miers's and Bolten's testimony is currently before a federal court.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Thursday September 4 2008.

  "<p>It is becoming difficult not to feel sorry for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/alistairdarling\">Alastair Darling</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/03/economy.taxandspending\">Norman Lamont</a> of our day. He inherits and gets blamed for a grim set of economic problems, not of his own making; he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/aug/30/alistairdarling.economy\">indulges in a bit of honesty</a> with a Guardian journalist in his croft, and gets lambasted from all sides; he tries to do something to help struggling homebuyers and, as the headlines show today, he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/03/economy.economicgrowth\">gets slammed</a> for that too. <br> Of course, underlying all this, is a particular problem \u2013 his nextdoor neighbour. We don't know if Mr Darling is kept awake at night by the sound of Gordon Brown shouting at staff at No 10, but the prime minister, who is famous for not taking blame where blame is due, is both the architect of Britain's economic fortunes, and the chancellor's boss. Whenever there's a crisis, deputy heads will roll, and Mr Darling's time in No 11 is surely numbered. The queue to succeed him is equally sure not to be long.  The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/03/economy.economicgrowth\">scepticism</a> about Brown's and Darling's economic rescue package is well-deserved. It is frankly bizarre that we spend years complaining about house prices being ridiculously high, and then feel the need to prop them up with taxpayers' money when they start coming down again. The cut in stamp duty and free loans are aimed at people entering the housing market, but these people are no longer the problem \u2013 they are gleefully watching once out-of-reach housing coming closer to grasping distance with every month, and wisely waiting for the right moment to pounce. Someone who could only afford a one-bed flat will soon be able to afford a three-bed house. The problem is those who already own their home who are now stuck with rocketing mortgage costs and negative equity, who were offered little yesterday.<br> But the real lesson for Brown and Darling is also a lesson for the Conservatives, who \u2013 if polls continue as they are \u2013 will inherit the economic state we are in. They won't be blamed for the problems, at least at first, but are wondering what they can do to remedy them. The fact is that there is very little that the government \u2013 any government \u2013 can do. We are in for a very uncomfortably long cold bath, come what may. Whether it is the international oil price, or the collapse of the credit market, there are no levers that ministers can pull that will make any real difference. (At least, after the event \u2013 it would have been possible to prevent the build-up of the credit bubble. All a new government can really offer is sound economic management over the long term.) However, this is not a message that ministers usually feel comfortable giving. Like a father to his children, politicians like to flatter themselves by conveying the impression of omnipotence. But it might be better \u2013 both politically and economically \u2013 to resist the urge to be seen to be doing something, but rather to manage expectations instead. The government should be honest with the public, and admit that it can only make a difference at the margin.  The problem both for the current government and its successor is that the one powerful tool they do have \u2013 control over tax and spending \u2013 has been put out of action. The government has a <a href=\".uk\">vast and growing budget deficit</a>, a real handicap going into a recession, which reduces tax take while boosting welfare spending. One forecast predicted the deficit would be a crippling 9% of GDP by the likely time of the next election, far higher than the (rapidly dropping) deficit the Tories handed over to Labour in 1997. <br> The big black hole in the government's finances will be one of the defining features of the next election campaign. Inheriting a state teetering on bankruptcy, the Conservatives would be in no position to boost the economy by cutting taxes, which would just make the public finances even more perilous. The Conservatives could help balance the books by cutting public spending, but that would be very unpopular (although the politics of that appear to be changing fast). Alternatively, they could raise taxes, but the public are already fed up with how much they give to the government. After a decade of unprecedented increases in public spending, there are no easy alternatives left.  As a matter of political as well as economic strategy, the Conservatives must resist the urge to bribe voters as soon as they are elected. Instead, they should dole out any painful medicine while they still have political capital and everyone still blames Labour \u2013 that way, they are more likely to be able to offer to give voters what they want closer to the election after next, sometime around 2014.  The frustration of the Tony Blair years is that he was handed an extraordinary opportunity to increase the amount we spend on health and education, but didn't use it to oil the wheels of reform. With budgets now under pressure, any real reforms to raise public service standards will be far more difficult to get past unions, professionals or managers. We have gone on a trillion-pound spending spree, with precious little to show for it apart from a massive hangover. Like the parents coming home after a runaway teenage party, the Conservatives will have missed the festivities, but will still have to clean up the mess.</p>",
  "<p>A British soldier who shot dead a colleague while playing with a gun he thought was unloaded was convicted of manslaughter today.</p> <p>Twenty-year-old Aarron Kendrick shot fellow rifleman Edward Vakabua in the head while inside barracks at Saddam Hussein's former palace in Basra last year. He had aimed a sniper rifle \"in jest\" at Vakabua as he lay asleep without realising the weapon was loaded, a court martial heard. </p> <p>Vakabua, a 23-year-old Fijian in the same platoon, received immediate treatment but was pronounced dead soon afterwards. </p> <p>Kendrick, of the Wiltshire-based 4th Battalion The Rifles, admitted negligently discharging an L96 sniper rifle but denied manslaughter. </p> <p>A board of five Army officers, the military equivalent of a jury, today took two hours to find him guilty. </p> <p>Kendrick told his court martial at Bulford military court in Wiltshire that he was messing around with a sniper rifle he had not been trained to use. He then cocked the weapon and pulled the trigger, shooting Vakabua, who was lying on a bunk bed.</p> <p>Recalling the incident, Kendrick said in evidence today: \"I squeezed the trigger and there was a bang. I thought 'What the fuck?' I dropped the weapon. I remember running up to Rifleman Vakabua and that's as far as I remember.\"</p> <p>Kendrick was then removed from the room. He said at first he was in shock but he realised what he had done. \"I was heartbroken. I knew him (Rifleman Vakabua) as a good friend,\" he told the court. \"I made a mistake. I caused the death of a very good friend of mine and there is nothing I can do to change it.\"</p> <p>Colonel Nigel Jones, prosecuting, had told the hearing Kendrick had showed \"wanton disregard for normal safety precautions\".</p> <p>While weapons were not meant to be left loaded inside barracks, the court martial was told that the two snipers regularly left 10-round magazines in their rifle so they were prepared for emergencies. </p> <p>A month before his death Vakabua had saved the life of another soldier injured by mortar fire, volunteering to drive him to a helicopter evacuation site despite the continued attack. </p> <p>Kendrick will be sentenced next week.</p>",
  "<p>The Palestinian government in Ramallah will propose that Arab nations deploy a joint military force in Gaza once a coalition government has been formed between the rival factions Fatah and Hamas, the Palestinian foreign minister, Riad Malki, said today.</p> <p>Malki said he would be taking the idea to a meeting next week of Arab foreign ministers in Cairo, which opens on Monday. He said the proposal came from the Palestinians though Egypt's foreign minister, Ahmed Aboul Gheit, also raised the prospect of sending a pan-Arab force to Gaza last week.</p> <p>Gaza is now under the control of the Islamist Hamas movement, which won Palestinian elections in 2006 and then seized full control of the strip last year after a near civil war with its rival Fatah. The Hamas government was then sacked and the Palestinian president and Fatah leader, Mahmoud Abbas, appointed a replacement government in Ramallah on the West Bank. Attempts since then to bring the two sides together into a new unity government have made little progress, but without that in the short term few see how any peace agreement with Israel could be implemented.</p> <p>\"The first step to take is to establish a coalition government that is not partisan and not factional,\" Malki said in a talk at the Israel Council on Foreign Relations in Jerusalem. He said that any joint government should then prepare for early parliamentary and presidential elections.</p> <p>\"During that time we do believe that there is a need to restructure the security services and to impose law and order in Gaza. To do that we do need pan-Arab forces to be deployed into Gaza for such a mission,\" he said. \"We will listen to the reaction of many Arab countries in this regard.\" It is by no means clear which Arab nations, if any, would contemplate sending their forces into Gaza.</p> <p>Malki also suggested that although Abbas' four-year term as president runs out in January next year, he is likely to stay in power for another year so that parliamentary and presidential elections can be held simultaneously. That would put the elections in early 2010, when the four-year term of the Palestinian parliament expires. Malki said the decision was up to the constitutional court, but he said: \"The presidential and parliamentary elections should go in parallel at the same time.\"</p> <p>He also said there had been no progress so far in the nearly year-long peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians, a process which began at Annapolis, in the United States, last November. He said the two sides had exchanged positions, ideas and maps but had not come to any agreement. \"Until this moment they did not start writing one single word on paper and the reason for that is that they don't really agree on any issue or sub-issue yet,\" he said. \"Are they willing to continue the negotiations? Yes. For how long? We will see.\"</p> <p>Earlier Malki had read out a speech prepared by Salam Fayyad, the Palestinian prime minister, who had been due to address the meeting but who cancelled his appearance at the last minute. Fayyad warned that the two-state solution, which would see the creation of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel, was receding.</p> <p>\"I feel that a two-state solution is losing currency amongst both our peoples and with the world community beyond,\" Fayyad's speech said. \"The current dynamic of no peace and no war will inevitably come to an end.\" He said there was no military solution to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, only a political one. \"We are not Finns or foreigners in an alien land,\" he said. \"We are Palestinians in Palestine and it is time for us to be recognised, to receive justice and liberty.\"</p>",
  "<p>The US is to give Georgia $1bn (\u00a3500m) in aid to help it rebuild after last month's war with Russia over its separatist enclaves. </p> <p>The aid package, which will be announced later today by Condoleezza Rice, coincides with the start of trip by the vice-president, Dick Cheney, to the former Soviet republics of Azerbaijan, Georgia and Ukraine. The trip is designed to show US support for its allies in the region.</p> <p>\"President Bush has sent me here with a clear and simple message for the people of Azerbaijan and this entire region: The United States has deep and abiding interests in your wellbeing and security,\" Cheney said today on his arrival in Azerbaijan. </p> <p>Moscow sent tanks and troops into Georgia last month after the Georgian government attempted to reassert control over South Ossetia by force. The scale of Russia's reaction, and its subsequent recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, another breakaway Georgian region, as independent states has drawn condemnation from the west. </p> <p>The aid package is expected to total just more than $1bn for reconstruction, staggered over two years. The US will specify that a significant proportion will be devoted to budget support, as well as to rebuild housing, transportation and other infrastructure destroyed in the conflict.</p> <p>Sources said the White House plans to approach the campaigns of the Democratic presidential nominee, Barack Obama, and his Republican counterpart, John McCain, to get a guarantee the financial assistance will continue after President Bush leaves office in January. </p> <p>The Bush administration is also considering moves to punish Moscow for the Georgian intervention, such as possibly scrapping a lucrative civil nuclear deal. The EU has criticised Russia for its military offensive but has so far stopped short of imposing sanctions.</p> <p>Cheney will head to Georgia after visiting Azerbaijan, before visiting Ukraine, which, like Tbilisi, is also seeking membership of the Nato security alliance. He will also be promoting the need for former Soviet states to export their oil and gas reserves using routes that bypass Russia.</p> <p>\"The United States strongly believes that together with the nations of Europe, including Turkey, we must work with Azerbaijan and other countries in the Caucasus and Central Asia on additional routes for energy exports that ensure the free flow of resources,\" Cheney said. </p> <p>The US aid offer comes on top of a loan of $750m from the International Monetary Fund. The loan is intended \"to help mitigate the adverse economic and financial consequences of the recent conflict\", the IMF said.</p>",
  "<p>Why does anyone buy pre-washed, bagged salad? </p> <p>Well, obviously, because it looks so fresh and lovely and it's so clean and convenient, it must be good for you, never mind that it costs a fortune. And because ignorance is bliss. Now, a professor from Imperial College London <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/sep/03/foodsafety.foodanddrink\">has gone and ruined it</a> by warning that food-poisoning cases are likely to increase as people buy more salad this way. Pre-washed doesn't mean safe to eat, he said. It can just mean \"looks clean but actually is contaminated with salmonella or E coli\". Buy a bag of pre-washed salad and you need to wash it all over again.</p> <p>More than four years ago, I deconstructed a ready-to-eat washed salad bag for my book <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/may/29/highereducation.news1\">Not on the Label</a>. I pointed out that between 1992 and 2000, the period during which the new phenomenon of bagged salads took off, nearly 6% of food-poisoning outbreaks were associated with prepared vegetables and salads. A study in 1996 of retail samples of bagged salad found 13% contained E coli. </p> <p>I was contacted more recently by someone who worked as a \"quality controller\" in the industry and had long experience of a large salad-washing factory. It was as bad, if not worse, than I said, he told me. The leaves are washed in huge tanks of water that is only changed once a day and merely topped up in between. The mud and dirt builds up. At periods of peak demand, and with pressure on prices, the system gets close to breaking point. Chlorine added to the water to control pathogens was supposed to be computer-regulated, but sometimes they were having to add extra doses by hand. </p> <p>But it's not just the bugs that bother me. Getting all this salad to us, often out of season from abroad, depends on a hidden army of workers. Sorting, washing, cutting and packing leaves by hand is a labour-intensive business. But we haven't all become so rich that we can afford servants, so the labour all too often is provided by exploited and underpaid migrants living in squalor. The problem continues. Recent inspections by the <a href=\"http://www.gla.gov.uk/\">Gangmaster Licensing Authority</a> uncovered bonded labour and plenty of other abuses in salad production in Britain. </p> <p>One of the main sources of out-of-season salad for British supermarkets is southern Spain. Vast swathes of Murcia and Almeria have been given over to these thirsty crops. Growing them intensively in monocultures depends on heavy agrochemical use. The miles of greenhouses form one of the bleakest industrial wastelands I've seen. The workforce there depends too on migrants, many of whom live in makeshift cardboard houses without sanitation. </p> <p>You can tell how worried the industry is from all the work being done. This week's <a href=\"http://www.foodmicro2008.org/programme.shtml\">conference on food safety</a> in Aberdeen had a whole session on food-poisoning bacteria in salad. The titles of the papers presented give you a flavour \u2013 here's an example: \"Microbiological Study of Fresh Herbs from Retail Premises Uncovers and International Outbreak of Salmonellosis\". </p> <p>Have you noticed, too, how few bags claim to be \"ready to eat\" these days, as they did in the past. Most of the ones I've seen just say \"washed\" now. </p> <p>In the US, which suffered three deaths and more than 200 people poisoned by E coli from spinach salad leaves in 2006, the authorities have given up trying to solve the problem at source. That outbreak was traced back to contamination from an intensive cattle feedlot. The Food and Drug Administration <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/08/21/health/main4371934.shtml\">has recently sanctioned</a> irradiating salad; in effect, accepting contamination in fields and processing is apparently inevitable. </p> <p>I actually counted how many washed leaves you get in a \u00a31 bag of salad once. The answer? Two leaves of frisee, one of red radicchio, two of a pale green crunchy variety, and about 18 whole and seven torn tiny dark green leaves about the size of a 2p coin. </p> <p>There are times when you are under pressure when labour conditions and environmental damage elsewhere are not at the front of your mind. But surely the only point in spending all that money on a bag of salad is that it saves you the bother of washing your leaves. Why buy it if it doesn't?</p>",
  "<p>The sister-in-law of the former prime minister Tony Blair said today she has been barred from leaving the Gaza Strip, more than a week after she entered the territory in defiance of an Israeli blockade.</p> <p>Lauren Booth, the half-sister of Cherie Blair, said she has been trying to leave Gaza since last Friday, but has been prevented at both Israeli and Egyptian border crossings.</p> <p>Booth was among 46 pro-Palestinian international activists with the Free Gaza Movement who sailed into Gaza waters on August 23 to draw attention to Israel's blockade. The blockade has prevented the area's 1.4 million Palestinians from travelling abroad and crippled the local economy.</p> <p>Most of the protesters left Gaza on the same boats last Thursday and sailed to Cyprus but Booth and several other activists stayed behind to carry out human rights work.</p> <p>Booth said she had asked British diplomats in the region to get her out of Gaza. \"High-level diplomatic manoeuvring is going on when none should be needed,\" she said.</p> <p>She said she has not spoken to Blair, who is the international community's Middle East peace envoy.</p> <p>Israel and Egypt sealed Gaza's borders after the Islamic militant group Hamas seized power in June last year. The sanctions have halted the movement of almost all goods and people across Gaza's border.</p> <p>An Israeli foreign ministry spokesman said his government was still weighing up whether to let Booth into the country.</p> <p>\"This is something she should have thought about before entering Gaza,\" he said. \"Nothing was coordinated with Israel.\"</p>",
  "<p>It's not often that Alex Salmond lapses into malapropisms, but at the launch of his legislative programme in the Scottish parliament today, he referred to the \"levitation\" of the Liberal Democrat, <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/scotland/article4615536.ece\">Tavish Scott</a> to his new post as leader, and talked of a \"hysteric\" vote by the convention of Scottish local authorities. He covered up this touch of the John Prescotts by turning these slips into jokes, but you couldn't help wondering if the first minister's attention might have been elsewhere. </p> <p><a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7595583.stm\">Fifteen bills</a> is a respectable enough programme for a second year of government, but they are not exactly historic, or should that be hysteric. Bills on curbing off-licence sales to under-21-year-olds, and restricting the display of tobacco in shops are unlikely candidates for the history books. \"There should be no limits to our ambitions for this nation\", said Alex Salmond with unintentional bathos as he announced measures on community sentencing and separating the dates of local and parliamentary elections.</p> <p>But if there is a mundane quality of this electoral programme there is a reason: the SNP want to avoid any distractions to the one really important bill before Holyrood this session: the legislation to scrap the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7594469.stm\">council tax</a> and replace it with a local income tax, dubbed \"the Nat tax\" by the Labour opposition. Last year, with the cooperation of the Scottish councils, the Scottish government froze council tax and now it wants to replace it with a tax related to ability to pay. But local income tax has been widely criticised by opposition parties and some economists as a costly irrelevance which will further erode council autonomy and provoke conflict with London. </p> <p>What the SNP is proposing is a 3p in the pound local rate to be set centrally and collected by local authorities. This, they say, would be more progressive than the council tax, because it would be related to actual income rather than the value of houses. The vast majority of families, they insist, would be better off under their scheme, which would be stable, transparent and cheap to collect.</p> <p><a href=\"http://news.scotsman.com/politics/SNP39s-local-income-tax-could.4229214.jp\">Critics</a> have said that local income tax would be expensive and would remove any incentive towards efficiency in the provision of local services because cost savings would not be reflected in reduced local charges. Others say that it would put local authority funding into the hands of central government, which is contrary to the provisions of the Scotland Act. The Scottish Liberal Democrats support a local income tax, but say it should be set locally rather than by government ministers in Edinburgh.</p> <p>Another more pertinent criticism is that it would benefit older single people living in large houses, because tax would no longer be related to property, and that local income tax would penalise dual-income households with children who would have to pay twice. It would also increase the headline rate of income tax in Scotland and might discourage inward investment. Still others say that the scheme would cause a <a href=\"http://www.theherald.co.uk/politics/news/display.var.2404734.0.snp_local_income_tax_blow_as_experts_pwc_criticise_plan.php\">financial crisis</a> in the Scottish budget because Westminster is refusing to continue paying an annual \u00a3400m in <a href=\"http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/2008/03/11/scrap-council-tax-and-lose-400m-in-benefits-westminster-warns-alex-salmond-86908-20347294/\">council tax benefits</a> if council tax is scrapped.</p> <p>There's no doubt that this withholding of council tax benefit is the greatest obstacle to the SNP plan. Scottish government insiders have hinted that the scheme might be impossible to finance if London refused to continue paying this important local government subsidy. Alex Salmond described this block on council benefit as \"embezzlement\" in his speech to parliament today; but so far the UK government is refusing to budge, insisting that there is no open-ended commitment to subsidise each and every fiscal innovation the Scottish government introduces.</p> <p>Now, since the minority Nationalist administration took over in 2007, there has been much talk of Alex Salmond picking fights with Westminster, but in fact there has been surprisingly little real discord between Edinburgh and London in the last 18 months of SNP rule \u2013 until now. The SNP insists that the Scotland Act gives Holyrood control over local authority finance, and that to withhold a subsidy that has existed for 15 years is an unwarranted assault on the authority of the Scottish parliament. James Purnell, the UK work and pensions secretary, is <a href=\"http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/latestnews/Salmond-tax-plan-in-tatters.3834253.jp\">adamant</a> that \"If there is no council tax there is no council tax benefit\". This is a real stand-off. </p> <p>The Scottish Conservatives are watching this confrontation closely. The Tory Scottish spokesman, James Mundell, recently indicated that the Conservatives under David Cameron might be prepared to negotiate over the \u00a3400m in council tax benefits. The Tories are looking for ways of compensating Scotland for any loss of MPs' voting rights in Westminster and reform of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnett_Formula\">Barnett formula</a>. However, the Scottish Conservatives are still opposed to local income tax as a replacement.</p> <p>Two of the three candidates for the Scottish Labour leadership, vacated by Wendy Alexander after her resignation in June, have also said they want to scrap council tax. However, they haven't made clear what they would replace it with. They rejected proposals from the <a href=\"http://news.scotsman.com/counciltax/Burt-blows-1bn-hole-in.2835809.jp\">Burt commission</a> two years ago for a 1% property tax based on revised property valuations, but say they still want a property-based tax. The intriguing question here is whether Westminster would continue to withhold council tax benefit to any Labour-inspired replacement for council tax. The reality is that it is simply impossible to reform Scottish local authority finance if Westminster refuses to continue to fund it.</p> <p>Will the SNP get their bill through? Well, it will be very close. The vote could depend on the two Green MSPs and the independent, Margo MacDonald. My own soundings suggest that while the Greens prefer land value taxation, they would be open to persuasion and regard the council tax as beyond saving. Margo MacDonald also feels the council tax has had its day, but will want something in exchange for her vote. The Liberal Democrats will probably come on side if there is some tinkering to give a degree of local authority discretion in setting the rate of council tax, which means the bill will probably pass. Only then will the first serious constitutional confrontation with Westminster begin.</p>",
  "<p>This year, Dartmouth College celebrated the <a href=\"http://insidehighered.com/news/2008/08/13/delta\">30th anniversary of National Lampoon's Animal House</a>, the classic tale of bacchanalia based on the school's Alpha Delta Phi fraternity. While college still retains the aura of youthful indulgence and excess, toga parties have gone out of style, and student alcohol abuse is a problem that schools are taking ever more seriously. The issue has gained renewed prominence in recent weeks, as more than 100 college and university presidents have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/22/alcohol.education\">called for a debate about reducing the legal drinking age</a> in the US as a way of curbing binge drinking.</p> <p>In 1984, following a successful campaign by the organisation <a href=\"http://www.madd.org/\">Mothers Against Drunk Driving</a> (Madd), the legal drinking age in the US was raised from 18 to 21. The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Minimum_Drinking_Age_Act\">National Minimum Drinking Age Act</a> accomplished this change indirectly by restricting highway funds to states that did not enforce the higher drinking age. According to Madd, the law has been effective: alcohol-related traffic deaths among 16- to 20-year-olds decreased 60% between 1982 and 2006.</p> <p>Underage drinking is not exclusively a college problem, but colleges receive young people liberated from the restraining influences of their families and communities three years before drinking becomes legal. Rather unsurprisingly, binge drinking is more prevalent at so-called \"party schools\", where alcohol is allowed to flow freely, according to <a href=\"http://www.jsad.com/jsad/article/What_We_Have_Learned_From_the_Harvard_School_of_Public_Health_College_Alcoh/2252.html\">a recent study by the Harvard School of Public Health</a>.</p> <p>And, as the saying goes, it's all fun and games until someone gets hurt. Some <a href=\"http://www.collegedrinkingprevention.gov/media/Journal/136-Hingson.sep.pdf\">1,700 college students die each year</a> in alcohol-related accidents. A 2006 study of <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2006-08-29-campus-fires-cover_x.htm\">deadly fires on college campuses</a> by USA Today found that alcohol was a factor in 59% of them.</p> <p>Many schools have responded by taking a harsher attitude toward student drinking. Shortly after being named <a href=\"http://www.alligator.org/articles/2008/07/29/news/campus/080729_party.txt\">the nation's top party school</a> by the Princeton Review, the University of Florida <a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/blogs/paper-trail/2008/8/8/florida-proposal-would-ban-drinking-games.html\">introduced a revised student code of conduct</a> that would ban \"any extreme alcohol consumption activity that constitutes, facilitates or encourages competitive, rapid or excessive consumption of alcohol\" - including such party favourites as keg stands and ice luges.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1828085,00.html\">Beer pong</a>, a popular drinking game in which players attempt to toss ping-pong balls into cups of beer, has been banned at Georgetown, Yale, Tufts, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Massachusetts at Amherst and other schools. Last fall, even Dartmouth, the game's birthplace, where the party culture dies hard, outlawed water pong, a non-alcoholic version.</p> <p>It's easy to scoff at schools for being overly paternalistic, but they have more at stake than embarrassed dignity or even student safety. Thoughts of potential liability are ever-present in a litigious time. After his son died in 2006 in an alcohol-related fire at the University of Dayton, Kim Cohen sued the school. \"We passed the baton to the University of Dayton. They dropped it, and now we have to carry that loss,\" he told USA Today. \"There comes an assumption of safety. Their inaction cost my son's life.\" The parents of a Rider University student who died last year after a <a href=\" http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/23/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/23Rrider.html\">suspected fraternity hazing incident</a> also filed suit, prompting administrators to tighten the school's alcohol policy.</p> <p>The risks are not limited to alcohol abuse, either. The shootings at Virginia Tech and Northern Illinois University vividly demonstrate what can happen when schools fail to provide the supervision and counselling that troubled students require. The families of those killed at Virginia Tech <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/education/higher/articles/2008/04/11/va_tech_families_agree_to_deal/\">received $11m in compensation</a>, and the parents of MIT student Elizabeth Shin <a href=\"http://www-tech.mit.edu/V121/N70/70shin-article.70n.html\">filed a $27.6m suit</a> against the school, following their daughter's apparent suicide in 2000. Though that case was later <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2006/04/04/parents_strike_settlement_with_mit_in_death_of_daughter/\">settled out of court</a>, it put many colleges on high alert.</p> <p>With such large interests of their own to protect, schools' commitment to protecting students may be met with scepticism. Even as colleges introduce new measures to identify students with mental health problems, students who express thoughts of suicide are more likely to be <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/03/education/03suicide.html\">forced to take leaves of absence</a> than to be offered help. In one prominent case, after George Washington University sophomore <a href=\"http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/display.php?id=30692\">Jordan Nott checked himself into the campus hospital</a> in the fall of 2004 for depression that led him to contemplate suicide, he was charged with \"endangering behaviour\" - a violation of the student code of conduct - and received a blunt letter from the dean of students: \"You are hereby suspended from the George Washington University effective immediately.\"</p> <p>Colleges insist that such moves are intended to provide students with the care they need, while protecting the rest of the school community. Whether or not their motives are altruistic, however, the advantages for institutional security are undeniable. As Cornell's deputy counsel Nelson Roth <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1194020,00.html\">told Time magazine recently</a>: \"Once the student is gone or goes home, the individual becomes the responsibility of parents. Our obligation ends.\"</p> <p>The call from college presidents to consider a lower drinking age seems at odds with their efforts to restrict alcohol consumption. But are they opposed to drinking per se or just the manner and place in which it occurs? Instead of having 18-year-old freshmen drink clandestinely in dorms and frat houses, perhaps the schools simply prefer that they drink off campus in bars and nightclubs, where the responsibility for monitoring consumption and the onus of liability will fall on others.</p> <p>Each side of the drinking-age debate has evidence to support its position, but the real issue isn't which set of fatality statistics is more credible and compelling. The central question is how and at what age young people acquire habits of responsible drinking. Should it remain a college rite of passage, or should it begin earlier, under the supervision of parents and other adults? That's certainly a debate worth having.</p>",
  "<p>Russia will withdraw its troops from the \"buffer zone\" it has created in Georgia when they are replaced by international peacekeepers and once the Georgian government has signed non-aggression pacts with the breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, Moscow's ambassador to London, Yuri Fedotov said today.</p> <p>Speaking just before the arrival of the US vice-president, Dick Cheney, in Georgia, Fedotov said he \"deplored\" the severe criticism of Russia voiced by Gordon Brown and David Miliband in recent days. He also claimed to have repeatedly warned Britain's Foreign Office about the worsening crisis in Georgia in the months leading up to the conflict that broke out on August 7. He said he had been assured that the Georgian president, Mikheil Saakashvili was \"under control\" and would not instigate a conflict. The Foreign Office rejected his account.</p> <p>The Russian ambassador was speaking to a group of journalists about the prospects for a deal at a Moscow summit on Monday, when Nicolas Sarkozy will represent the European Union in talks with the Russian president, Dmitry Medvedev.</p> <p>\"I think the European Union is knocking at an open door,\" Fedotov said. \"I'm not in a position to anticipate the outcome of Monday's discussion, but if the EU proposes a very clear plan on how to prevent a potential confrontation and further shelling in the territory of South Ossetia ... then its not difficult to deploy 200 or 400 people in the zones and to allow Russia to withdraw its personnel. It depends on political will.\"</p> <p>Fedotov said there were 500 Russian soldiers, whom he called \"observers\", manning checkpoints in \"buffer zones\" around South Ossetia and the Georgian port of Poti, insisting they were only there to \"prevent further confrontation\".</p> <p>As a further condition for withdrawal, he said the situation on the ground would have to \"stabilise\" and non-aggression agreements would have to be drawn up between Tbilisi and the two breakaway regions. </p> <p>Tbilisi has so far rejected any agreements that confer sovereignty on the regions, which have declared independence but have been recognised only by Moscow.</p> <p>Fedotov suggested an international monitoring force could be organised by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), and should include Russian observers, although he added the Russian role was open to negotiation.</p> <p>The OSCE has only 28 monitors in Georgia, and they have so far been stopped from travelling around the conflict zone by Russian checkpoints. The arrival of another 80 observers is dependent on an agreement among OSCE members, including Russia, over the \"modalities\" of their deployment. </p> <p>The European Union has also said it will send hundreds of monitors.</p> <p>In the months before the conflict ignited, Fedotov said he led regular Russian delegations to the Foreign Office to express Moscow's concern over rising tensions between the Georgian government and the Russian-backed regions.</p> <p>\"It had become a kind of routine. Every week or every two weeks, we received instructions from Moscow to raise the issue of the situation around South Ossetia and Abkhazia officially and to warn that there may be some deterioration of the situation,\" he said. \"Warning signals were sent, but there was no meaningful reaction.\"</p> <p>He said Foreign Office officials told him that Saakashvili was under their control. However, he conceded that this was not a direct quote but his interpretation of what he was being told.</p> <p>Fedotov said: \"It meant that the United States, and the UK were talking to President Saakashvili. It meant that this regime was considered a kind of ally of the west and they were sure he will behave more responsibly.\"</p> <p>A Foreign Office official rejected Fedotov's account of the talks, saying the meetings had been upgraded with the participation of more British officials as the situation worsened in Georgia. </p> <p>\"As violence increased in July so did our concerns and our diplomatic activity, and I would completely refute the thesis that we were inactive or complacent,\" the official said.</p> <p>Russian leaders have blamed Saakashvili for starting the conflict. The Georgian president claims he only sent his troops into South Ossetia in an abortive attempt to pre-empt a long-planned Russian invasion aimed at occupying Georgia and removing him from office.</p> <p>Fedotov warned that any Nato attempts to rebuild Georgia's military after the conflict would be destabilising.</p> <p>\"If Nato now plans to rearm Tbilisi, to restore or even enhance its military potential, of course it will be very deplorable. And it would not help ... a political solution,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> Brooklyn. </p> <p><strong>The lineup:</strong> Caroline Polachek (vocals), Patrick Wimberly (drums), Aaron Pfenning (guitar).</p> <p><strong>The background:</strong> Chairlift formed in Boulder, Colorado and relocated to the Lower East Side in 2006, but are only just achieving recognition. Despite their dodgy name (are they taking us on an escalator to the stars, or paying tribute to those gizmos that help pensioners conquer the stairs?), they're another superb new band from New York. They're part of a loose coalition of acts who operate in and around Brooklyn, including MGMT, Yeasayer, Boy Crisis, Tigercity, Mixel Pixel and Apache Beat. Although they're all quite different, Chairlift do have something of MGMT's spacey pop sound (the duo even remixed Chairlift's single Evident Utensil), Tigercity's airbrushed 80s AOR revisited, and Boy Crisis' rhythmic new wave-inflected synthpop, about them.</p> <p>It's hard to get a fix on what they do, but some reference points do occur while listening to songs from this female-fronted trio's forthcoming debut album, Does You Inspire You. Bruises captures some of the eerie glee of the Cure circa Close To Me. Somewhere Around Here is slow and atmospheric with a delicate interplay between Polachek and Pfenning's voices that recalls Prefab Sprout at their most wispily bewitching. Territory is dreamy, ambient rock but not in a folktronic alt.rock, Bat For Lashes / Cocteau Twins sense - more in an 80s power ballad way, perhaps because of the way Polachek's voice is clear and upfront in the mix and you can hear all her words (cf the enchanting gobbledegook of a Bjork or Liz Fraser). Although they've toured with LA musician Ariel Pink, who puts his perfect pop through an experimental filter, Chairlift would appear to have mainstream ambitions. </p> <p>Take Planet Health, one of their best songs. It's apparently about our obsession with youth and fitness, but its melody, huskily ethereal vocals, imperious, stately tone and polished production conspire to make it sound like Berlin's 1986 hit Take My Breath Away, written by Giorgio Moroder for the film Top Gun. In fact, one reviewer has described Chairlift's music as like long-lost outtakes from a soundtrack to one of those Bratpack movies by John Hughes, while another has detected a noirish sensibility worthy of David Lynch.</p> <p>As with the soon-to-be-massive Ladyhawke (see <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/jun/09/popandrock2\">NBOTD No 329</a>) Chairlift's music evokes the sound of 80s American chart pop; only with an added edge, a knowing nod and attention to period detail that elevates it beyond ironic homage and puts it in Scissor Sisters territory - not in terms of style, but in its serious intent. There's a bit halfway through their track Earwig Town where the synths play these amazing minor chords and Polachek's voice rises and falls - it's utterly magical, and obviously the work of musicians determined to rescue that sort of mullets-and-wind-machines balladry from kitsch hell.</p> <p><strong>The buzz:</strong> \"Like forlorn Velvet Underground darling Nico attending an electro Tropicana beach party. On the moon.\"</p> <p><strong>The truth:</strong> By the end of their album, on tracks like Chameleon Closet and Ceiling Wax, Chairlift go all weird and arthouse, but the first seven or eight songs are MOR-tastic.</p> <p><strong>Most likely to:</strong> Be photographed for their first major press feature suspended several hundred feet above a ski resort in a titular aerial vehicle pulled by steel cables.</p> <p><strong>Least likely to:</strong> Be approached for tour promotion by Stannah.</p> <p><strong>What to buy:</strong> Does You Inspire You is released by Kanine on October 28.</p> <p><strong>File next to:</strong> MGMT, Of Montreal, Ladyhawke, The Knife.</p> <p><strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/chairlift\">MySpace.com/chairlift</a> ; <a href=\"http://www.chairliftmusic.com\">ChairliftMusic.com</a></p> <p><strong>Tomorrow's new band:</strong> Moriarty.</p>",
  "<p>A statue by Terence Koh of a tumescent Christ in Gateshead <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/03/religion.art\">has led to</a> predictable howls of outrage, followed by the now familiar scratchy noise of lines being drawn in the sand. \"Enough gratuitous offence to believers!\" says one side; \"enough kowtowing to religious sensitivities!\" say the other. </p> <p>I suspect a lot of people on both sides actually like a good blasphemy row. It gives both the opportunity to express that most satisfying of moral emotions: righteous indignation. But I'm getting bored of them. Whenever one blows up, there is an unsightly rush to \"inviolable principles\", when the dull truth, as usual, is that it depends.</p> <p>This case is actually clear-cut because the Christian suing the <a href=\"http://www.balticmill.com/index.php\">Baltic Centre</a> is theologically confused. Every good Bible-believing Christian must know that Christ was all God and all-man (which is an impressive 200% being) and that he is \"one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are\" (Hebrews 4:15). That means it is orthodox belief that Christ had a penis, which was at least once erect. Even the evangelical minister who taught us RE knew that, and I remember him admitting how troubling he found the thought of his saviour suffering sexual temptation.</p> <p>But not all complaints about religious offence can be so easily dismissed as failing on their own terms. What are we to say of these?</p> <p>As I said, it depends. Doughty defenders of free speech will have no truck with such quibbling. They insist on a right to offend, wheeling out John Stuart Mill's venerable \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harm_principle\">harm principle</a>\" to clinch the case: \"The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilised community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others.\" And, no, \"mere offence\" does not constitute harm. </p> <p>There are two problems with this simple view. Saying that we <em>have a right</em> to offend skips over the question of whether we <em>are right</em> to offend. I have a right to tell random strangers that I think they're ugly, or that they have terrible taste in clothes, but it would be wrong of me to exercise that right, and not just because of the pots and kettles principle.</p> <p>But isn't mockery good, and any belief system incapable of putting up with it deficient in some way? That's true, but you can't just ignore the background against which lampooning takes place. Christians, for example, are not oppressed, despite what some wannabe martyrs would have us believe. British Muslims, in contrast, are a somewhat beleaguered minority. We should think twice before mocking them because, while comedy speaking truth to power is funny, the powerful laughing at the weak is not. The difference is only subtle to those too dunderheaded to spot the obvious. Witness <a href=\"http://www.alan-partridge.co.uk/index2.php\">Alan Partridge</a> asking a Jewish comedian who uses Jewish humour to \"tell us a joke about Jews\".</p> <p>That does not mean that we should never do anything that causes Muslims offence, or that shows Islam in a bad light, of course; only that we should not do so lightly. The choice is not between an all-out offence offensive and craven silence.</p> <p>The other reason absolutist claims for speech acts are misguided is that we don't just utter words, we do things with them, as the Oxford philosopher <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._L._Austin\">JL Austin</a> put it. When words belittle or mock, they can reinforce prejudice and hierarchies that have very real effects on people's lives. Mockery of those already on the margins can shore up the very barriers that limit their life chances. </p> <p>Free speech is indeed precious, but that doesn't mean that we have to defend without qualification every moron who abuses it. Koh's Christ is a bad test case because Christians should not be offended by it in the first place, but simply reminded of their saviour's full humanity. But in the future, we should not always be in as much of a hurry to defend the offender, even when we allow their right to offend.</p>",
  "<p>The harassment of women on Egypt's streets has long been ignored as an ugly fact of modern life. Whether on their way to work, study or play, millions of women are pestered verbally. Of course, harassment is a challenge everywhere, as recent debates on Cif have revealed. However, there is hardly a woman in Egypt I know who has not been on the receiving end of unwanted male attention.</p> <p>To prove how widespread this phenomenon is, the <a href=\"|http://ecwronline.org/index.php?option=com_frontpage&amp;Itemid=1&amp;lang=english&quot;\">Egyptian Centre for Women's Rights</a> (ECWR) recently conducted a survey of hundred of Egyptian and foreign women of all backgrounds. Shockingly, 84.5% of them said they had experienced some form of sexual harassment, with most reporting that they were bothered by men every day. </p> <p>By highlighting the sheer magnitude of the crisis, the ECWR has managed to give massive new momentum to its \"Making the streets safe for everyone\" campaign. \"We have been running [our] campaign since 2005 ... When we started, we couldn't even say the words 'sexual harassment',\" the ECWR's Rebecca Chiao said.</p> <p>As a sign of the shifting tide, the group has <a href=\"http://ecwronline.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=278&amp;Itemid=1\">just released</a> a number of radio spots by leading female and male celebrities aimed at encouraging women to speak out and embarrassing men to \"respect themselves\".</p> <p>One reason for women's silence has been the profound sense of shame they feel when harassed. Egyptian journalist Mona Eltahawy decided to break the taboo and tell of her own experiences in a leading independent Egyptian newspaper, al-Masry al-Youm. In <a href=\"http://www.almasry-alyoum.com/article2.aspx?ArticleID=116822\">her article</a>, she recounts some of the nastier incidents she has experienced, including men groping her and exposing themselves. \"I learned to push and punch those whose hands thought my body was fair game, but I never found anything to soothe the burning violation,\" she confesses.</p> <p>My brother, Osama, who is working on an in-depth feature about this issue, calls harassment \"the tolerated crime\" because \"the majority of Egyptian men believe that women find being verbally harassed flattering,\" even though millions of them disapprove of it.</p> <p>While the proper Arabic word for harassment is \"tahroush\", in the popular vernacular it goes by the much more light-hearted term \"mu'aksa\", which means \"teasing\". And a lot of the harassment is relatively harmless, ranging from passing and unimaginative expressions of admiration along the lines of \"Hello beautiful!\" to humorous banter and even lyrical poetry, and some of it may actually be quite charming. </p> <p>But for many women the sheer intensity of the onslaught must make going out feel like psychological and emotional attrition. When you add to that the occasional fondling hand and graphic sexual invitation, then it becomes intolerable.</p> <p>There is a widely-held belief that women somehow \"ask for it\". In fact, in response to ECWR's campaign, an anonymous viral campaign has been calling on Egyptian women to \"protect themselves\" with the hijab, comparing a scarfless woman to an uncovered lollipop attracting flies. It's hard to decide which is more insulting: men as insects or women as sweets.</p> <p>Perhaps certain nightlife \"hot spots\", where beautiful young women literally stop the traffic, attract a greater concentration of pests but the ECWR study found no real correlation between dress and attention, as three-quarters of the women who complained of harassment already covered their heads. \"I wore the hijab for over nine years,\" Eltahawy says, \"and I never experienced more harassment than during that time.\"</p> <p>A number of recent extreme incidents have sparked public outrage. In 2005, women at a pro-democracy demonstration, including a few I know personally, complained of being manhandled, groped and verbally abused by security forces. </p> <p>One phenomenon that has particularly shocked is the growing number of serious incidents in which passers-by fail to intervene. In a society which prides itself on its strong sense of community and an attitude of collective intervention, such inaction provokes widespread public indignation.</p> <p>On one reported occasion, a woman was attacked by 16 men on a busy street and no one did anything until a courageous taxi driver leapt out of his cab, armed with nothing but his belt, and proceeded to beat them off.</p> <p>This incident prompted Kelemetna, an Egyptian magazine targeted at young people, to launch <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=20112551897\">a campaign</a> focusing on the perpetrators. Under the slogan, \"Respect yourself: Egypt still has decent men\", the initiative has mobilised groups of young male and female volunteers to tour the streets of Cairo and talk directly to men and women about the issue of harassment, as well as to <a href=\"http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/babylonbeyond/2008/08/egypt.html\">confront harassers</a>. </p> <p>While it is welcome that people are taking a stance, this type of initiative runs the risk of provoking vigilantism or, if the members of these voluntary patrols are not carefully vetted, of eventually attracting people who will abuse their position. In addition, although protecting women is a noble goal, it carries certain macho undertones.</p> <p>The last few years have also seen a concerted campaign gather steam to introduce tough anti-harassment legislation. However, such measures are merely scratching the surface. The clash between modernity and tradition is creating some warped concepts. The tide is unlikely to turn significantly on harassment until Egypt's sexual identity crises are addressed and resolved. What Egypt really needs is a revolution in attitudes towards sex that takes the shame out of consenting sexual relationships and equalises the sexual status of men and women.</p>",
  "<p>J\u00e9r\u00f4me Kerviel, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale's rogue trader, appeared before a Paris court today backed by a revamped defence team ready to go on the offensive to try to prove that the bank knew what he was doing. </p> <p>In January, SocGen unveiled record losses of \u20ac4.9bn (\u00a33.96bn), which it alleged were caused by the junior trader's unauthorised deals.</p> <p>Kerviel did not comment as he entered the Paris financial court to be questioned alongside his former aide for the first time. Thomas Mougard, 24, is under formal investigation for complicity in introducing fraudulent data into a computer system. He denies the accusations, arguing he was not aware of the illicit nature of the transactions he was asked to carry out.</p> <p>Kerviel is under formal investigation for breach of trust, computer abuse and falsification of documents. He has admitted building up non-authorised trading positions but has argued his supervisors turned a blind eye.</p> <p>Before the hearing, his new defence team made it clear it intended to implicate SocGen directly in the affair. According to one of his lawyers, they have evidence that some among the bank's hierarchy knew about the illicit nature of his transactions, an accusation SocGen has always strongly denied.</p> <p>\"The bank knew in detail about Jerome Kerviel's activities; a connivance that could go as far as complicity\", one of the lawyers, Bernard Benaiem, told France Info radio. \"We want to show that these elements of complicity will show this affair in an entirely new light\".</p> <p>It is claimed that emails exchanged between SocGen's financial controllers showed they were aware of the fictitious nature of some of his transactions as early as spring 2007. The lawyers have also mentioned a report by the French Banking Commission, which fined the bank \u20ac4m in July after uncovering \"grave deficiencies\" in SocGen's internal controls. Only the conclusions were made public but Kerviel's lawyers argue the main part of the report backs their case.</p> <p>Independent investigations and the bank's own internal inquires into the scandal have found that its managers and control systems failed to operate properly and ignored warnings. In May, SocGen's directors accused managers of negligence and said Kerviel's direct supervisor had been too tolerant of his activities. A report by PricewaterhouseCoopers blamed the \"culture\" at the Delta One trading desk, describing an \"overheated\" trading desk whose activities got out of hand.</p> <p>But so far none has actually gone so far as to claim that the bank knew about what was actually happening. By aiming to prove that it did, Kerviel's legal team is hoping to put the bank on the defensive. His lawyers could demand further investigations, which could set back further a case which already looks set to run for years.</p> <p>The defence also intends to put the spotlight on the events of last January, arguing that SocGen and not Jerome Kerviel was responsible for the bank's colossal losses by liquidating his transactions amid turmoil on the world's markets.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Rob will be here</strong> at 7pm.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Preamble</strong> Hello. Andy Murray and Juan Martin del Potro <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/sep/03/usopentennis.andymurray\">don't exactly have a locker-room bromance going on</a>, which adds a certain frisson to an already intriguing contest at Flushing Meadows tonight. Murray will reach his first grand slam semi if he is wins, but Del Potro is widely recognised as the world's best teenager and has won his last 23 matches (although most of them were against various generations of the Cobleigh family). The winner loses to either Mardy Fish or Rafael Nadal in the semis.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>7.05pm update</strong> It's all going wrong. Having been here since March 25, 1992, or at least 10am this morning, I now realise there's <em>another</em> game before this one. Knowing my luck this game will be a 7-6, 6-7, 924,321-924,319 epic. See you in a bit.</p> <p>\"We should,\" begins Gary Naylor, \"really enjoy 'still British' Andy Murray more than we do. In an age of media-coached tennis automata, he shoots from the hip on and off court. He's already the third-best shot maker in tennis (after the obvious two) and possibly the third-best interviewee in British sport (behind Roy Keane and Monty after he's signed for a 77). If this country treated tennis as a proper sport instead of a middle-class (sorry!) dating agency, Murray would be more appreciated, Henry / Ronaldo sulks and all.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>8.23pm update</strong> The aforementioned game has finished, with Safina taking real good care of Pennetta in two sets, so we'll be on soon.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>Pre-match foreplay</strong> \"In the absence of any live sport after the Sophia Gardens washout,\" begins Jack Lee, \"can I suggest the following riff: 'Guess the sports Gary Naylor doesn't know anything about and refuses to be interested in'. My bet would be Octopush\u2026\" Numberwang? Is that a sport?</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>Here they come</strong> Del Potro swaggers on like he's going down the catwalk with a hot poker in a private position; trying too hard to ramp up the body language, basically. Murray looks at peace with himself, like he's been listening to Mogwai for the last half-hour. The Zidane score, to be precise.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>As if this match</strong> wasn't tense enough, my last train is at 12.05am (allow half an hour to get there from here).</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>Murray* 1-0 del Potro</strong> Murray holds to 15 with very little fuss. </p> <p>\"Can I put a fiver on there being no sports that Naylor isn't interested in,\" says Andy Bradshaw, simultaneously making an accurate point and closing the door on the one riff we had to get us through this evening.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>Murray 2-0 del Potro*</strong> Hideously flat camera angle on Eurosport, but from it we can discern that del Potro recovers from 0-30 only to blow it with two unforced errors. Great start for Murray.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>Murray* 3-0 del Potro</strong> So far Murray is all over del Potro, who keeps slamming relatively routine returns into the net under pressure that is mainly mental. Murray holds to 15 in that game, and that's three games in eight minutes, a ratio that appeals to those in a hurry.</p> <p>\"Just watched Murray unwrap his racquet on the court just minutes before he plays his quarter final. Are there any other sports where participants come this unprepared?\" says Tim Woollias, stopping short of the inevitable sex gag. \"Does David James come out with his gloves still in the wrapper.\" You missed the question mark! Why does everyone hate the poor question mark????????</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>Murray 3-1 del Potro*</strong> del Potro, the youngest quarter-finalist here since Andy Roddick in 2001, claims his first game, mainly through errant Murray returns. It's a slightly subdued start, albeit to Murray's taste. del Potro holds to 30.</p> <p>Here's Matt West. \"Assuming we all agree that there are no sports about which Gary Naylor knows nothing, can I suggest an alternative riff? Mike Ashley or Sarah Palin - who is the bigger liability to their organisation? Now I think about it, Keegan and Palin is a better comparison. Both adored by their constituency but viewed with a mixture of of amusement and bafflement by anyone outside it.\"</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>Murray* 4-1 del Potro </strong> One deliciously deep return from del Potro sets up a thrilling cross-court blast to make it 15-15, but Murray's first ace of the match makes it 30-15 and then a truly majestic slice/backhand lob combination takes him to 40-15. An ace seals the deal.</p> <p>Or so we think: then del Potro challenges it, but as he does Eurosport goes to a break. For all we know WW3 may have broken lose. A few moments later we are told the call stands and that peace prevails.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>Murray 4-2 del Potro* </strong> del Potro, like a slowly recovering amnesiac, has at least found his game on his own serve, although there is a suspicion that Murray has gone into that dangerous hold-serve-and-I'll-win-the-set mode. One scorching forehand helps del Potro hold to 15.</p> <p>Is anyone out there?</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>Murray* 4-3 del Potro </strong> There's a game on now, right here: it's all square on serve after del Potro breaks. He took 10 minutes to get started but now he's well and truly in this. A Murray double fault gives him a chance and then some withering returns precipitate the unforced error that takes it to 0-30, and another double fault eventually gives del Potro the game to 15. Well, well.</p> <p>\"Wondering why Del Potro has inverted angel wings on his chest,\" says Stu Bulloch. \"Boogie Nights vest alert. What is it about sports star and rubbish clothes. Robinho at his press conference. Clown.\"</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>Murray 4-4 del Potro* </strong> The momentum, which fluctuates almost imperceptibly in these contests, is certainly with del Potro now. Despite another really outstanding cross-court, backhand lob from Murray, del Potro holds to 30. He is starting to really dominate Murray here, and you suspect that this first set is bigger than most.</p> <p>Here's Peter McLeod: \"Kind MBM readers might consider visiting this: <a href=\"www.downrightkenya.org\">www.downrightkenya.org</a>. These guys are raising money for a brilliant charity. They need sixty thousand quid, once they've got it they'll build a school in a bit of rural Kenya that really needs it.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>Murray* 4-5 del Potro </strong> A huge point at 30-30 ends with Murray letting a del Potro pass go and watching, to his horror, that it lands in. Well in, in fact. del Potro has got Murray by the stones here, and a spectacularly wide second serve from our man - honestly, it was hideous - means a double fault, which means del Potro is serving for the set.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>Murray 5-5 del Potro*</strong> Murray breaks! In what is becoming a comedy of errors, del Potro's first double fault gives Murray a real opportunity at 0-30. He nets a routine, second-serve return but then wins a long, long point to go 15-40. </p> <p>This needs the Benny Hill music really, because Murray then slices another routine backhand into the net. So it's 30-40, and then del Potro works Murray around the court before a volleyed pass brings us to deuce. <em>Then</em> del Potro slaps what should have been a straightforward forehand into the net and then slams a backhand wide after a 25-stroke rally. So we're level again.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>Murray 6-5 del Potro*</strong> Murray restores something resembling order - not so much in terms of his own position but an increasingly shambolic contest - holding to love with the aid of his fourth ace. My last train is 158 minutes away.</p> <p>\"Hello,\" says the beautifully named Caroline Hack. \"I generally dislike tennis, but since getting hooked on live blogs from the Olympics, I find some live blogs quite amusing and I am seeing how this one progresses.\" Well thanks, and goodnight: sorry to have failed you. \"And I'd quite like Murray to win, I suppose (and how old is his opponent).\"</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>Murray 6-6 del Potro*</strong> It's tiebreak time. Despite double-faulting the opening point, del Potro carries on with the momentum of his recent service games and holds with ease, partly thanks to one violently effective forehand at 15-15.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>Murray wins the first set 7-6 (7-2)</strong> A preposterously good drop shot gives Murray the first mini-break at 4-2, and that's all he needs: del Potro muffs a return next up and Murray serves twice to claim a frankly shambolic set 7-6. He got a bit lucky there, frankly.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>del Potro is getting treatment for a knee injury between sets</strong>, but it doesn't look too serious.</p> <p>\"So tell us who your money's on now, Rob,\" says Jen Hornsby. Not my last train, for sure. It has to be Murray. He didn't play at all well in that set, which was very much a case of the lesser of two shambles.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>del Potro* 1-0 Murray (Murray leads one set to love)</strong> del Potro, fresh from some Ralgex and a marginally overzealous rubdown from a male physician, holds to 15. This is an odd game because, well, it's a grand-slam quarter-final, and even in that game Murray earned his only point with a sumptuous backhand down the line, but in amongst the good there is a whole lotta bad.</p> <p>\"If it helps,\" says Richard O'Hagan, richly aware that it won't, \"the last train to here goes five minutes later. And Marylebone is probably 15 minutes closer to Farringdon. Although none of this will help when Murray blows the deciding fifth set with a double fault and a temper tantrum.\" He might not be alone.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>del Potro 1-1 Murray* (Murray leads one set to love)</strong> What del Potro has, apart form a headband that any man with a mullet would like, is a really spiteful forehand return. It troubles Murray in that game, but to little avail. Murray holds to 30.</p> <p>Here's fatherhood's/rock's/sports journalism's/professional Mancunian's Lee Calvert. \"Have we had the spotter's badge moment of Murray lamming a drop-shot into the net then gruffly dishing out a self-<em>r</em>ollocking afterwards? If not, my money is on the fourth game of the second set.\"</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>del Potro* 2-1 Murray (Murray won the first set 7-6)</strong> This game has had some Nurofen and is settling down a little: del Potro holds to 15. Murray is still, if we're doing this with an alphabet, on his C-game. It's not good.</p> <p>\"If you don't make the last train home you could always shelter under a bridge all night with just a bottle of La Phroaig for company. Not for the first time...\" goads Ian Taylor, knowing full well I've never found a bridge in such circumstances before.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>Second Set: Del Potro 2-2 Murray* (Murray won the first set 7-6)</strong> At 30-15, Murray slams another backhand into the net, and then a smart, angled return from del Potro gives him break point. Murray saves it with a sharp, deep serve and then closes out the game with a lovely backhand volley and an ace. Still a curate's egg of a contest.</p> <p>\"If Keegan is Sarah Palin, does that make Dennis Wise Karl Rove?\" says James Marsh. \"Both are reviled, scheming right-wingers and I'm sure I heard they both have a deep hatred of taxes.\"</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>Second set: Del Potro* 3-2 Murray (Murray won the first set 7-6)</strong> Murray, disconcertingly, has increasingly little answer to the <em>bronca</em> of the Del Potro serve. He holds to love.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>Second set: Del Potro 3-3 Murray* (Murray won the first set 7-6)</strong> Del Potro is getting opportunities here, really good ones, and he keeps blowing them: at 15-15, on the second serve, he slaps a backhand return into the net. Just inexplicable. But he gets to break point via a double fault - so then Murray saves with an ace. The match in miniature, basically: sublime and ridiculous arm-wrestling incessantly. </p> <p>But then Del Potro blows <em>that</em> break point with a shockingly negligent forehand, and Murray then holds after a really excellent rally. So we're back where we started nine minutes ago.</p> <p>Mac Millings may or may not be able to tell the worst joke ever: \"It seems a little unfair that Andy Murray is having to play against two players. On the other hand, Juan Martin might be handicapped by having to carry David Jason's Argentine cousin, Del Potro.\"</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>Second set: Del Potro* 4-3 Murray (Murray won the first set 7-6)</strong> A long, long game, which began around the same time as Eldorado, ends with Del Porto holding after <em>four</em> deuces. Murray was 0-30 at one stage, but the unforced errors continue. This really is a poor game of tennis, in truth. There have been 49 unforced errors.</p> <p>\"Is del Potro something of a Gordon Greenidge?\" asks Gary Naylor. \"The more one-legged he becomes, the better he plays.\"</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>Second set: Del Potro 4-4 Murray* (Murray won the first set 7-6)</strong> One shot that is working absolutely perfectly tonight is Murray's cross-court backhand lob. At 30-15, and after a long rally, he whips it out again to the usual effect. It works quite beautifully, and then a painfully accurate backhand wins him the game at 40-30.</p> <p>Is anyone out there?</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>Second set: Del Potro* 5-4 Murray (Murray won the first set 7-6)</strong> Del Potro produces his first ace at 15-15, and then a beauty down the middle at 30-30 before holding. This looks set for a tiebreak.</p> <p>\"I beg to take issue with your opinion that this is a 'poor game of tennis',\" says Gary Naylor. \"Unforced error counts are more a mark of a player's attacking intent than poor play. Aranxia Sanchez Vicario playing moonball with Monica Seles was error-free tennis and rubbish. This match has a bit of needle, high stakes and players going for the lines - if my kids eventually go to sleep and I get a beer, it'll be just right!\" I am so busted.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>Second set: Del Potro 5-5 Murray* (Murray won the first set 7-6)</strong> Murray, serving to save the set, does so: the key point comes at 30-15 when Murray stops mid-rally, challenges, and is justified when replays show Del Potro's backhand was long.</p> <p>\"I have noticed that there is background music in-between games,\" says Lee Calvert, hyphenating inbetween when I'd probably have gone for one word, but it's each to his own and that's alright with me, \"and so far I've recognised The Who's 'I Can't Explain', and bizarrely one of Elton John's lesser 80s hits. Surely they should come up with something more relevant to the tennis? Such as, 'Deuce' by Kiss or 'Love Don't Live Here Anymore'. I'm pretty sure every single one of your nine readers can think of better examples than those.\" Love Stinks off the Wedding Singer?</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>Second set: Del Potro* 5-6 Murray (Murray won the first set 7-6)</strong> That's a huge break for Murray. At first it looks unlikely: he stops mid-rally again, but this time he loses a baseline call by <em>this</em> much. He drags the game back to 30-30, however, and then Del Potro feels the squeak of the bum and double-faults.</p> <p>So it's break point, but Murray's limp return goes long. But then two frankly pitiful shots from Del Potro hit the net, and Murray is serving for a two-sets-to-love lead. \"Doesn't Jeff Tarango sound like Greg Rusedski?\" asks Rory Young, quite possibly answering his own question.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>Second set: Del Potro 6-6 Murray* (Murray won the first set 7-6)</strong> Murray, serving for the set, makes a shocking mess of it: Del Potro breaks to love - to <em>love</em> - so we're going to another tiebreak.</p> <p>Here's Richard O'Hagan: \"So far as I can make out, the only appropriate song for this game is Hall &amp; Oates' 'I Missed Again'. Although Carter USM's 'Rubbish' may also be suitable.\"</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>Murray leads 7-6, 7-6 (7-1)</strong> Murray mini-breaks with the first, fourth and five points of the tiebreak. So despite a lovely pass from Del Potro on the sixth, Murray claims the second set 7-6 (7-1). Surely, surely, he will close this out from here.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>Third set: Murray* 1-0 Del Potro (Murray leads 7-6, 7-6)</strong> Murray hurries through his service game to 15 and you suspect that the swing of that last set - breaking to love to earn a tiebreak and then losing it so quickly - has broken Del Potro's will.</p> <p>In other news, here's Matt Mealor. \"On appropriate break songs, how about Tennessee by Arrested Development? Tennis-sy? Hyphenated? Question marks?\"</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>Third set: Murray 1-1 Del Potro* (Murray leads 7-6, 7-6)</strong> Del Potro shows those cojones of which we fondly speak but rarely ask to see, holding serve from 0-30 in a seven-deuce game. The length and outcome of that game has just got him back in a contest that was surely gone if he had surrendered serve.</p> <p>\"Naylor's hoping for his kids to go bed and a beer,\" notes Tim Woollias. \"I had my kids asleep and a cold lager, but my wife's just got home and we're now watching Desperate Housewives. Any ideas how I swing the TV back to the tennis? I wasn't going to miss two question marks...\" Shameless plot-spoiling usually works for me. Or throwing the TV out the window. OK so you can't watch it either then. But at least you've got me. I don't see anybody quip-by-quipping Desperate Housewives around here.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>Third set: Murray* 2-1 Del Potro (Murray leads 7-6, 7-6)</strong> Murray produces a huge, deep backhand at 15-30 and then takes the game with two big first-serves. </p> <p>\"Surely 'You Give Love A Bad Name' by Bon Jovi after Del Potro fails to capitalize on his love break in the second set?\" offers Umair Khan, not unreasonably.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>Third set: Murray 3-1 Del Potro* (Murray leads 7-6, 7-6)</strong> That, surely, is that. From 40-15 on the Del Potro serve, Murray takes three points in a row. He then blows one break-point but claims the second, and Del Potro responds by thudding his racquet into the turf. It's all over bar the last train.</p> <p>\"I have a beer,\" goads Matt Mealor, \"but sadly, despite Sex and the City triple bill having finished, I am still not allowed the remote. I really should get some trousers in this house. There's a lady having her femininity operated on whilst Lisa Rogers' voice tells me it looks completely normal. Beer is not enough. I'd swap it for kids and the remote right now, Naylor.\"</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>Third set: Murray* 3-2 Del Potro (Murray leads 7-6, 7-6)</strong> This is getting ridiculous. As in the second set, Murray surrenders a break faster than you can say 'Tim Henman' - that time to 15. He's genuinely doing this to wind me up.</p> <p>\"Given the demand for tickets for any sporting event in England - okay, betting without Middlesbrough home games - and the price of tickets, isn't it easier to travel the world watching top class sport?\" asks Gary Naylor. \"There's thousands of empty seats for this match, and I bet it's about $30 on the door. The same goes for cricket in Aus and football in Germany. If I live long enough to retire, that's what I'll be doing - you coming too?\" Must we wait for retirement? Must we?</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>Third set: Murray 3-3 Del Potro* (Murray leads 7-6, 7-6)</strong> Del Potro holds to 15.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>Third set: Murray* 4-3 Del Potro (Murray leads 7-6, 7-6)</strong> Good stuff from Murray, who holds to love. As the man on Eurosport points out, shame he didn't do it two games ago when he'd just broken. But if he can break here he'll be serving for the match.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>Del Potro has an injury break for his admittedly painfully knee just to ensure some of us will miss our last train</strong></p> <p>\"I find myself agreeing with Mr Naylor,\" winces Sarah A. \"Following an expensive summer of following cricket and tennis in this country, I have decided to forgo ludicrously expensive Ashes tickets and will hopefully be getting to the French Open, US Open, and with any luck the Champions League final too. I'm all for a Murray win; I just hope he doesn't pull out the bicep celebration or I may just be physically sick at the sight of it.\"</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>Third set: Murray 4-4 Del Potro* (Murray leads 7-6, 7-6)</strong> From 15-40, Murray wastes two break points, proving once again that it's never over until the last train has hotfooted it in the general direction of the Kent coast. Del Potro then takes the next two points to keep this merry little tale alive.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>Third set: Murray* 4-5 Del Potro (Murray leads 7-6, 7-6)</strong> Del Potro breaks Murray! I can't quite believe this. There were two really poor shots from Murray in there, and Del Potro breaks to 15 when a backhand from Murray goes long. Dear me. A moment ago Murray had two points to break and then serve for the match. Now he's going to a fourth set.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>Del Potro wins the third set 6-4; Murray leads 7-6, 7-6, 4-6</strong> Del Potro holds his nerve and his serve (to love) to take the set. Well. Well. Well. Murray had an enormous opportunity at 4-3 and 15-40 on the Del Potro serve, but now all bets are off.</p> <p>\"Tell Mr Naylor his retirement plans may need a lot of baubies,\" says Paul Prechner, not unreasonably mistaking me as a two-bit flunky. \"There may be a lot of empty seats but they don't come cheap. An exhibition NFL game played here in Toronto had a face price of $550 per ticket and I don't believe they were the best seats.\"</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>Fourth set: Murray* 0-1 Del Potro (Murray leads 7-6, 7-6, 4-6)</strong> \"Fact is so often stranger than fiction\" is Eurosport Man's explanation of this turnaround. Mine isn't printable, even at this hour. </p> <p>Anyway, Murray carries on where he left off in the third set - he's broken to 15, after back-to-back double faults from 15-30, and you would almost make Del Potro favourite here.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>Fourth set: Murray* 0-2 Del Potro (Murray leads 7-6, 7-6, 4-6)</strong> The crowd's love for Del Potro grows with every victorious game: that's five in a row, and all the momentum is with him at the moment.</p> <p>\"I'm half with Gary Naylor re: the quality quota, but would venture that Del Potro's game isn't much given to top-notch harem-scarem,\" says James Marsh. \"His tennis mirrors his face in that it's steadfast but with the odd interesting angle; a bit one-dimensional but beholden of flashes of Latin flair; muscularly anodyne but more than capable of achieving results against a decent opponent e.g. in rounds 1-4 here or on a slow Thursday night in a Slug &amp; Lettuce in provincial Cordoba.\"</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>Fourth set: Murray* 1-2 Del Potro (Murray leads 7-6, 7-6, 4-6)</strong> Murray wins a game, his first in six, and to love as well. He really needed that, but in the wider narrative of the game it might not mean much. Make no mistake: he has a real problem here.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>Fourth set: Murray 2-2 Del Potro* (Murray leads 7-6, 7-6, 4-6)</strong> Murray breaks back! This is a real slugfest now, if it wasn't already. Del Potro is in trouble at 0-30 but pulls it back to 30-30, aided by only his third ace of the match. Then he double faults to give Murray break point, and then Del Potro goes long under very little pressure to give Murray parity in this set. Is it possible for a tennis match to literally never end?</p> <p>\"Paul Prechner's example is, with respect, misleading,\" bows Richard O'Hagan. \"Almost all NFL teams charge full whack for pre-season games and it is an enormously contentious topic. Imagine being asked to pay full price to see Man Utd's fourth team play a meaningless friendly against another side who were also playing their fourth team. Fans of the US version of football are up in arms about it, as are the majority of the journalists, who are sick of being made to cover meaningless matches like this. As a result, there is serious talk of cutting the pre-season in half and having more games during the regular season. The emptiness of the stadia therefore means nothing, especially in Toronto, which the Buffalo Bills will be playing one game a season in from now on and where they arguable have even less right to rip off the locals than they do back home. Sorry if that's a bit serious for this time of night, but I'd hate Naylor to think things were always going to be this way and therefore give up on his dream.\"</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>Fourth set: Murray* 3-2 Del Potro (Murray leads 7-6, 7-6, 4-6)</strong> Murray saves <em>four</em> break points to hold serve. That was a huge game, including a successful challenge by Del Potro on the fourth deuce, but Murray held in there splendidly and moves ahead in this set for the first time.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>Fourth set: Murray 3-3 Del Potro* (Murray leads 7-6, 7-6, 4-6)</strong> After that tumultuous game, Del Potro holds relatively comfortably to 15. Murray could have done with a bit more respite on the Del Potro serve there.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>Fourth set: *Murray 3-4 Del Potro (Murray leads 7-6, 7-6, 4-6)</strong> Del Potro breaks again, and Murray is in serious trouble here. He is booed when he challenges a return of his that was called long at 0-0 (it was long) and a help-yourself forehand and then an errant backhand take him to the brink at 0-40. Del Potro misses one break point but not the second, with Murray going wide on another backhand. For the quarter-final of a grand slam, this is an amazingly open contest, and that's not a compliment to the players.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>Fourth set: Murray 4-4 Del Potro* (Murray leads 7-6, 7-6, 4-6)</strong> It's now reaching the stage where a break of serve is the norm: Murray does so there, to 15 after a 17-stroke rally on the final point, and that's the fourth break in this set. Both men - combined age 40, so men might be pushing it - are basically having sporting nervous breakdowns here.</p> <p>\"You'll be missing the first train at this rate,\" chuckles Gary Naylor.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>Fourth set: Murray* 5-4 Del Potro (Murray leads 7-6, 7-6, 4-6)</strong> And now, suddenly, Del Potro will serve to stay in the match after Murray not only wins a service game but rushes through it in four points. The psychology of that may prove very important, and I expect him to close this game out now on the Del Potro serve. Especially as Del Potro's knee just seized up on the last point. He hasn't asked for treatment, but he did stop completely on that last point.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>Fourth set: Murray 5-5 Del Potro* (Murray leads 7-6, 7-6, 4-6)</strong> A rasping forehand from Del Potro wins the psychologically crucial first point, and from there it's relatively plain sailing for him: he holds to love, aided at 30-0 by the 100th unforced error of the match.</p> <p>\"I'd like to offer a critical re-appraisal of this match. It actually seems to be a case of two evenly matched players, canceling one another out,\" says Richard O'Hagan. \"Of course. I've drunk a bottle of wine and half a bottle of champagne since it started...\"</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>Fourth set: Murray* 6-5 Del Potro (Murray leads 7-6, 7-6, 4-6)</strong> This game is now being scripted by David Lynch. It's utterly incomprehensible. Just when you thought order was being restored, after two comprehensive service games, Del Potro seriously threatens another break, first at 15-30 and then deuce. But Murray hangs on, clinching it with a swinging first serve, and again he's one game from victory. Unlike the last time, I don't remotely expect him to get it this time. Yes, this is a pathetic and remarkably juvenile attempt to tempt fate.</p> <p>\"Looks like it's the Smyth Memorial Sofa for you then,\" smirks Sam Collins. \"Even for a tennis addict like you this must be pushing it a bit.\"</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>Murray wins 7-6, 7-6, 4-6, 7-5</strong></p> <p>Murray is through to his first grand slam semi-final after three hours and 57 minutes. It's been a remarkable game, though not in an especially good way. Both men were all over the place at times, but both showed real courage: Del Potro because of a knee injury, Murray because he was playing like a dog. Murray will now play Mardy Fish or Rafa Nadal in the semis. Thanks for all your emails; I'll leave you with two more while I head to the nearest sofa. </p> <p>\"Don't suppose there are any sofa beds at GU Towers?\" says Ian Taylor. \"Er...not like that; I didn't mean for me...\" </p> <p>\"Ian Taylor in the foyer for Rob Smyth,\" writes theguardian.com/reception.</p>",
  "<p>Their caricatures suggest they are very different men - Kevin Keegan a firebrand, Alan Curbishley just bland \u2013 but what is clear is that both are suffering from very similar problems. Or \"suffered\" in the case of Curbishley, who today decided to put himself out of West Ham's misery by submitting his resignation.</p> <p>Curbishley, it seems, could no longer tolerate the creeping redefinition of what it means to be a Premier League manager. English gaffers have long been much more than head coaches, dictating everything from travel arrangements to tactics to transfers. While some bosses still exert that role \u2013 Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, for instance, even helped design Arsenal's Emirates Stadium \u2013 others have been increasingly sidelined by superiors eager to take greater control over how their money is spent. There appears to be a clash of personalities at St James' Park, but most of all Newcastle and West ham have been rocked by a clash of ideologies.</p> <p>In both cases it is difficult to know how long the new approaches are intended to last. In particular, West Ham's cost-cutting could be just a temporary necessity caused by the extravagance of the previous regime. Anton Ferdinand and George McCartney are competent enough players, but any club hoping to trim its wage bill would find it hard to resist an offer of \u00a313m for the pair. Indeed, some would say that by paying so much, and the concomitant salaries, Sunderland have just concluded the sort of deal that landed West Ham in their current predicament in the first place.</p> <p>Curbishley's departure didn't provoke the outpouring of emotion that immersed St James' Park yesterday because he never took the Hammers to the highs to which Keegan once treated Newcastle. But nor did he take them to the depths to which some headless Hammers fans have recently accused him of sinking. Indeed, he saved them from relegation soon after taking charge (even if in the process he presided over one of the club's worst ever performances, a gutless 6-0 surrender at Reading).</p> <p>Last season he guided them to tenth despite the squad being shredded by a brutal spate of injuries. That was reasonable performance, though it's true that there was always a certain risk of squad depletion given the injury history of some of the players Curbishley was allowed to sign. Still, the manager was perceived by many fans to have underperformed, largely because of the lofty expectations fanned by the previous chairman, Eggert Magnusson.</p> <p>There is also another factor in the lack of love for Curbishley. Just his interpretation of what it is to be a manager may be out of date, his measured tones and dignified demeanour is out of keeping with modern football, in which image \u2013 and a visible expression of \"passion\" - is increasingly important.</p> <p>The current favourite for Curbishley's job, the Croatia manager Slaven Bili\u00e7, shows plenty of passion of course \u2013 but surely more for his country than for a West Ham side with little money to spend?</p>",

  "<p>The Republican party hasn't just been winning presidential elections for most the past four decades, it's been winning the political conversation. From lavishly funded thinktanks like the <a href=\"http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Heritage_Foundation\">Heritage Foundation</a> to rightwing yakkers filling the airwaves, the Republicans have dominated the political conversation. The Republican convention this week will feature many of the key phrases that highlight the shift in America's politics. </p> <p>Here's a sampling to help you keep score: </p> <p><strong>Choice</strong><br>Although it's still part of the abortion debate (see <strong>pro-life</strong>), choice is also a Republican code word for privatisation, a term that got a bad name with President Bush's <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/18/politics/campaign/18social.html?fta=y&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;position=\">botched attempt to privatise social security</a>. It's also used for promoting private sector involvement in traditional government functions. Now Republicans talk about \"retirement choice\", \"Medicare choice\" or longstanding favourite \"school choice\". </p> <p><strong>Class warfare</strong><br>Progressive taxation was integral to America's income tax system from its origins, in line with a basic tenet of the American way of life, fairness to the little guy. When liberals controlled the conversation, they used the term <strong>economic justice</strong>. But then came Ronald Reagan. <strong>Reaganomics</strong> contended that lower taxes were more fair - government shouldn't penalise success, Reagan argued. Rather than squabbling over how to divide the pie, Republicans promised a bigger pie for all, without mentioning that haves would get an even larger share of the pie than have-nots.</p> <p>Reaganomics also promised that lower taxes would produce more revenue by spurring greater growth. Reagan's 1980 Republican primary rival, George Bush Sr, called it <strong>voodoo economics</strong> before he became Reagan's running mate. Reaganomics proved to be a dismal failure in fiscal terms, but its message that cutting taxes for the rich, like greed, is good stuck. Lower taxes on the rich are now presumed to spur economic growth. </p> <p>Contrary experience - recession under Reagan and his successor Bush Sr, America's <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/29/business/29tax.html\">growing income gap</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jan/05/oil.useconomy?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=networkfront\">jobless growth of the Bush years</a> that preceded the current stagflation - has not shaken this article of rightwing economic faith. Moreover, increasing the tax burden on the poor further excites Republicans because it supposedly dampens enthusiasm for government spending among the main beneficiaries, since they're footing the biggest portion of the bill.</p> <p>If you advocate progressive taxes - rather than accepting the emperor's new clothes view that Reaganomics works - you are engaging in class warfare. If you favour regressive taxes, you are promoting economic growth and helping the poor.</p> <p><strong>Death tax</strong><br>Rightwing anti-tax advocates recast the estate tax as the death tax and portrayed it as government's final insult against hardworking Americans. In truth, with estates up to $2m exempt from taxes, less 0.3% of US estates, representing the absolutely wealthiest Americans, pay any estate tax at all, according to United for a Fair Economy.</p> <p>Yet Republicans were able to turn the death tax into a grassroots rallying cry. They whined about forced sales of small businesses and family farms to pay estate taxes. They were <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/05/AR2006060501360.html\">never able to produce a single example</a> of such a forced sale, but that didn't stop them.</p> <p><strong>Hillarycare</strong><br>Americans get worse healthcare and pay more for it than citizens of other western industrialised nations. The reason is simple: America is the only western industrialised nation without some form of universal healthcare. While working people face choices between medicine or insurance and food or rent, Republicans are able to derail any serious debate, let alone progress, on universal healthcare with the magic word: Hillarycare.</p> <p>The phrase recalls Hillary Clinton's <a href=\"http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F03E3D71E39F93AA1575BC0A962958260&amp;scp=66&amp;sq=hillary+clinton+health+care&amp;st=nyt\">botched attempt to reform the system</a> early in Bill Clinton's presidency, still her most lasting legacy. Republicans use Hillarycare to conjure a healthcare system of limited choices, extraordinary expenses and poor outcomes, precisely what the US has today. </p> <p>The term can also be used to mock increasing government oversight in any area. Greater regulation of mortgage lenders in the wake of the subprime loan debacle would be <strong>Hillarycare for financial markets</strong>. </p> <p><strong>Hope</strong> vs <strong>Opportunity</strong><br>Democrats talk about hope and dreams. Republicans talk about opportunity and progress. Hopes and dreams are elusive and imprecise, like most Democratic messages. Opportunity and progress are more tangible and measurable, which mean that they can be taken away. Republicans claim that government is a barrier that takes away opportunities, when in fact if you are black, Hispanic, female, disabled or otherwise disadvantaged, the federal government is your guarantor of opportunity, mainly thanks to programmes and policies Democrats initiated. </p> <p><strong>Liberal</strong><br>Republicans have made liberal an indictment, not a legitimate viewpoint. If you are liberal, you are out of the <strong>mainstream</strong>. With two of the most liberal US senators on the Democratic presidential ticket, expect the L-word to fly early and often in St Paul.</p> <p><strong>Post-9/11 world</strong><br>To Republicans, living in a post-9/11 world justifies American unilateralism, including a pre-emptive war against a phantom enemy in Iraq, in the name of <strong>national security</strong>. In fact, the Bush administration's post-9/11 world strategy has made America less secure, converting global solidarity and goodwill to unprecedented levels of anti-Americanism, alienating allies and goading enemies into active hostility. Yet Democrats are portrayed as failing to understand the post-9/11 world.</p> <p><strong>Pro-Life</strong><br>When I cut my television news teeth at CNN in 1991, pro-life was up there on the forbidden list with <strong>foreign</strong> (Ted Turner was an early believer in the global village). The media had adopted the term pro-choice for abortion rights advocates, but no self-respecting news organisation used pro-life to describe foes of abortion rights.</p> <p>Pro-life held additional irony since anti-abortion zealots were bombing women's health clinics and shooting doctors. But under constant assault of anti-abortion forces and charges of liberal bias, the mainstream US media has been cowed into adopting pro-life as the standard term for opponents of abortion rights. Aside from the politics, it's an inane description: who this side of Josef Stalin isn't pro-life?</p> <p><strong>Working People</strong> vs <strong>Wealth</strong><br>Both parties say they're friends of working people. But Democrats often demonise wealth while seeking a common touch, and that's out of touch. Democrats still portray themselves as champions of the underdog. But in today's America, voters don't identify with Cinderella. They want to be Prince Charming. Republicans have convinced Americans to vote not their situations but their aspirations, while, as seen in Denver last week, Democrats have become increasingly unconvincing. As seen from the list above, Republicans don't need any kind of help to dominate discussions, or elections.</p>",
  "<p>The IRA has effectively disbanded as an underground army and no longer meets for any terrorist purposes, an independent body found today.</p> <p>However, the International Monitoring Commission (IMC) report says the Provisionals' ruling body, the army council, has not dissolved \u2013 a key unionist demand. </p> <p>The Northern Ireland Office (NIO) and government ministers talked up the positive messages contained in the <a href=\"http://www.independentmonitoringcommission.org/documents/uploads/ACF1599.pdf\">latest IMC report (PDF)</a>. They stressed the inactivity of the IRA and the fact that there appears to be no sign of fresh recruitment, intelligence gathering or other potential terrorist operations from within the republican movement.</p> <p>Today's NIO and ministerial briefings reinforced the message yesterday of Northern Ireland's chief constable, Sir Hugh Orde. The head of the Police Service of Northern Ireland told a delegation of Democratic Unionist politicians that whilst the IRA army council still exists it no longer meets to map out paramilitary campaigns, activities or strategies.</p> <p>Peter Robinson, Northern Ireland's first minister, has made disbanding the army council a condition for the last step in devolution \u2013 the transfer of policing and justice powers from London to the Stormont assembly.</p> <p>Robinson repeated his determination yesterday that the army council must dissolve before those powers are handed over. Although he accepted Orde's advice that the IRA ruling seven-man council was no longer meeting for terrorist purposes, Robinson said: \"We require the removal of the IRA's army council and we've always made that clear.\" The first minister said such a move would build confidence within the community and acceptance that in the future a Sinn Fein minister might exercise some control over security matters.</p> <p>A Sinn Fein source warned yesterday against Robinson setting the issue down as an absolute condition. 'He would be very silly if he did,\" the source said.</p> <p>Sinn Fein has said publicly that it might pull out of power sharing if policing and justice powers are not transferred.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/sep/02/google.microsoft\">Google's dramatic entry</a> yesterday into the <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/digitalcontent/2008/09/google_joins_the_browser_wars.html\">world of browsers</a> \u2013 the software that navigates us around the web \u2013 can be regarded in two ways: open war against Microsoft, which has over 70% of the global market for browsers \u2013 and a much more vital 90% of the operating systems that run computers \u2013 or Google's philanthropy to the rest of the world to promote wider usage of the web. And the rest of the world, of course, includes arch-rival Microsoft which, like other browser creators such as <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/\">Firefox</a> (20%) and Apple's <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/safari/\">Safari</a> (6% and rising) can make use of its impressive innovations because they are based on open standards not proprietary software.</p> <p>The truth lies somewhere in between but either way it raises uncomfortable questions about Google's increasing dominance of the web. </p> <p>The new browser, called <a href=\"http://www.google.com/chrome/\">Chrome</a>, is certainly a gift in that, like all of Google's other consumer products, no charge is made. Google makes its money from advertising and, to a lesser extent, from corporate deals. So the more the web is used the more money it gets from its search advertising. It is in danger of building up one of the most dangerous monopolies of all time \u2013 control of most of the information we deal in including our secret web lives. And yet, it is totally innocent of the charge that defines traditional monopolies \u2013 that they exploit their monopoly positions by overcharging consumers \u2013 because it doesn't charge at all.</p> <p>After playing around with it for a few hours one can say it certainly does what Google claims giving faster, cleaner and more reliable access the web with some snazzy innovations. I have switched to it as the default browser on my Windows PC (it is not available for Macs yet).</p> <p>So, another success for Google \u2013 and that's the problem. The company is like a friendly octopus that is gradually wrapping its tentacles around you. It started with search and Google now has around 75% of the global market. In theory this is the flimsiest monopoly of all because you only need to type \"Yahoo\" (almost indistinguishable in quality from Google's search) into Chrome's search box to escape, but it is not that easy. I recently changed my default search engine to <a href=\"http://clusty.com/\">clusty.com</a> as an experiment because it has some interesting features such as a dedicated Shakespeare search engine and an option to search through clouds of tags. But the experience usually lasts 45 seconds because as soon as one navigates to other pages, Google search boxes become ubiquitous and you can't be bothered go back to the default one.</p> <p>One by one, Google's tentacles have entangled me: news, its documents feature (I write practically everything on this service because it is automatically saved on the web so you can work from any computer), maps, gmail, <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/\">YouTube</a>, the admirable book search plus blogs. It recently tried unsuccessfully to lure me away from <a href=\"http://secondlife.com/\">Second Life</a> with a virtual world of its own <a href=\"http://www.lively.com\">Google Lively</a> for Windows only, and the very cool recent improvements to its <a href=\"http://picasa.google.com\">Picasa</a> photo hosting site, such as doing visual searches on faces in photos, nearly made me think of dropping my beloved <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com\">Flickr</a>.</p> <p>It is in this context that the Chrome browser must be seen. Its improvements, some borrowed from smaller browsers such as the innovative <a href=\"http://www.opera.com/\">Opera</a>, may have difficulty making inroads into Internet Explorer's 72% market share simply because the Microsoft offering, much improved since it has had to face real competition from Firefox, is embedded in most PCs when they leave the factory and typical users won't bother to change out of inertia. Google won't lose too much sleep because its real objective is to lure individuals and corporations away from Windows on the desktop and on to the web where Google hosts all its applications including search, videos and gmail.</p> <p>That, increasingly, will be the problem. Google's ability to use the success of its search engine to lure users to embrace all the other features that it is progressively improving will make it a one-shop stop for most people using the internet. If Google is eventually successful in cornering a larger share of the browsing market on top of what it knows about our search, video, writing and reading habits, it will know more about us than is healthy for any organisation private or public to be vested with. And it will be difficult for new start-ups to provide fresh competition. </p> <p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_Richelieu\">Cardinal Richelieu </a>once said that if you gave him 10 sentences written by the most honest man he would find something in them to hang him for. Google could do that in a fraction of a second. If Google were publicly owned, it would render the FBI and MI5 redundant. It is only because Google has more-or-less kept to its mission statement \"Don't be evil\" (well, outside of China, where it partially caved in to government censorship) that it hasn't generated widespread suspicion. As it, remorselessly, gets ever bigger and more pervasive, the corrupting influence of power could be felt more. And who knows what will happen decades ahead when the present , public-spirited owners have moved on?</p> <p>That said, the browser itself will bring much-needed competition to the market. Chrome has a deceptively simple interface that hides a lot of hot features. A single box at the top combines the role of search engine and URL slot so if you type something in it will immediately recognise whether you are looking for a web address (URL) or just searching. It will make suggestions if it thinks you have made a typo though, curiously, while it suggested the proper spelling of my name when I typed in \"Victor Kegan\", it failed to recognise \"crome\" as a misspelling of the name of its own browser. It will learn quickly. </p> <p>The \"tabs\" at the top enabling you to work on multiple sites at once are not linked so when one tab crashes the others don't follow it. Also, you can drag a tag down the screen and it becomes a window. The speed at which it works \u2013 thanks largely to the way it has made Java (the software that is ubiquitous on the web) perform much faster is very impressive and the \"incognito\" feature that enables you to leave no footprints on sites you visit is bound to be particularly popular with the erotica market which is hugely popular on thde web, if rarely written about.</p> <p>It is difficult to feel sorry for Microsoft which has battled by fair means and foul to maintain its hugely lucrative 90% monopoly of operating systems now being attacked in a pincer movement by the revival of Apple and a migration of individuals from the desktop to the web, lured by the siren sounds of Google. How long it will take for corporations to follow suit is anyone's guess, not least because the cost of shifting from an embedded system is huge. Some comparisons show that Microsoft recently increased its market share slightly.</p> <p>Microsoft, however, has every reason to be worried. The danger is that we will be exchanging one form of monopoly for another one that will eventually have more power over us than Microsoft could ever dream of.</p>",
  "<p>Alex Salmond faces his most significant political battle since taking power in Scotland after pressing ahead today with controversial plans to replace council tax with a new tax on income, despite substantial criticisms by business and financial experts.</p> <p>Launching his legislative programme for the coming year, Salmond issued a challenge to the business community, the government in Westminster and opposition parties by insisting that the Scottish parliament would scrap the \"regressive, unfair\" council tax with a new bill in 2009, despite their opposition. </p> <p>The first minister claimed that a local income tax, to be set by ministers at 3p in the pound, would deliver a net tax cut of \u00a3281m and leave eight out of 10 families better off \u2013 figures business leaders dispute. </p> <p>His calculations were challenged by Labour, who accused him of planning an underfunded \"tartan poll tax\" that would leave councils with a shortfall of \u00a3800m, damage hard-pressed local services, and make Scotland the highest taxed part of the UK. </p> <p>Annabel Goldie, the Scottish Conservative leader, said that local income tax had been widely \"rubbished and ridiculed\", but it quickly emerged that the new Liberal Democrat leader, Tavish Scott, is to begin talks with the SNP about supporting the measure.</p> <p>The Lib Dems support a local income tax but want the rate to be set by individual councils. Scott is being carefully courted by the SNP. Salmond's minority government must have Lib Dem support if it hopes to see its plans voted through. </p> <p>After being noticeably silent on the proposals in the chamber, Scott issued a short statement after the debate. \"We want to see the abolition of the discredited council tax,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Liberal Democrats want a genuinely local local income tax and we look forward to working with the government to deliver that.\"</p> <p>The proposal to introduce a local income tax is the centrepiece of the Scottish National party leader's second legislative programme, unveiled this morning among 15 new bills as the Scottish parliament returned from its summer recess.</p> <p>The new legislation includes a health bill that will introduce new restrictions on tobacco sales in shops, and a criminal justice bill which could ban under-21s from buying alcohol in shops and set a minimum price for alcoholic drinks.</p> <p>After the fiasco over rejected ballots and broken vote-counting machines marred last year's Scottish elections, Salmond said his government would also \"decouple\" the elections for Scotland's 32 local councils from Holyrood elections.</p> <p>Councillors will instead have two five-year terms, rather than four years at present, to enable local elections eventually to take place two years after Holyrood elections. This measure, recommended by Ron Gould's inquiry last year, will get all-party backing.</p> <p>Salmond failed, however, to bring forward detailed plans for several of his highest-profile pledges, including a new \"Scottish Futures Trust\" to replace private finance for major capital projects such as the new Forth bridge and new schools. </p> <p>Labour added that he had failed again to legislate to reduce class sizes or end automatic early release for prisoners. </p> <p>He has also dropped troubled legislation to set up a new national arts body, Creative Scotland, to replace the Scottish Arts Council and Scottish Screen. </p> <p>Last year's bill collapsed after MSPs uncovered financial errors in the proposals, leaving the arts world in a hiatus. The legislation has now been wrapped up in a public services reform bill \u2013 a measure seen as an embarrassment for Linda Fabiani, the arts minister.</p> <p>Labour's acting leader, Cathy Jamieson, one of three contenders for the Scottish party's leadership, said that Salmond's proposals for a local income tax were so discredited that \"the SNP are ashamed to mention its name. Instead, it is transformed into the 'abolition of council tax bill'.</p> <p>\"Whatever Alex Salmond decides to call them, the SNP's tax plans will simultaneously make Scotland the highest taxed part of the UK and damage local services. That's why they are opposed by virtually almost everyone in Scotland, from the STUC to the CBI.\"</p> <p>Some proposals are far less contentious, however. Labour and other opposition parties are likely to support ambitious climate change targets for an 80% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2050, several legal reforms, and measures to introduce free school meals.</p> <p>However, the SNP is also introducing a new marine bill, to improve conservation and introduce new planning guidelines for fishing, oil and marine industries, which will be separate from the UK marine bill being backed by Westminster and the Welsh and Northern Irish assemblies. Labour claims this will mean Scottish marine legislation will be out of step with the rest of the UK.</p>",
  "<p>A perennial favourite among the scholars who peruse these pages is the debate about <a href=\"http://www.yesitsarealsport.com/\">what makes a sport \"real\"</a>. </p> <p>The short answer, of course, is that any sport invented by a 19th century British public schoolboy is undoubtedly authentic, while <a href=\"http://media.www.tuftsdaily.com/media/storage/paper856/news/2005/04/21/Viewpoints/Viewpoint.Ultimate.Frisbee.Ultimately.Not.A.Real.Sport-1490939.shtml\">all others are almost certainly not</a>.</p> <p>Then there's the debate about who qualifies as a real \"fan\". Again the answer is self-evident: he's an English male capable of both faking a reasonably non-middle class accent and bluffing his way through a pub conversation about association football. Everybody else is bogus.</p> <p>But in sport the word \"real\" has other meanings. There is, for instance, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_tennis\">real tennis</a>, a major cause of the <a href=\"http://shakespeare.about.com/od/faqshakespearesworks/f/tennisballs.htm\">1415 Plantagenet invasion of France</a> that culminated in the battle of Agincourt where Henry V's stout English and Welsh yeomen invented the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jXFnQUU7yg&amp;feature=related\">modern sport of archery</a>.</p> <p>There are also Americans who play what they consider to be \"real\" baseball - complete with authentically itchy uniforms. And Englishmen who delight in <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hddYiSixKGQ\">a \"real\" version of soccer with no rules or tactics</a> whatsoever. </p> <p>It is thus with some trepidation that I announce the unveiling of the Campaign for Real Sport. I use word \"campaign\" here in its broadest sense since there's no way I'm going to set up a website or circulate a petition or kidnap some hostages or do anything that might actually make a difference. But I nonetheless believe that the need for a Campaign for Real Sport is increasingly urgent. That's why I'm insisting that you - yes, you - pick up this ball and run with it, lest the campaign fade and die (as did three previous incarnations <a href=\"http://www.upsideclown.com/2003_08_07.shtml\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=1AB99usTnpsC&amp;pg=PA288&amp;lpg=PA288&amp;dq=%22campaign+for+real+sport%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=Vb7srPFIi1&amp;sig=Jle5BrwOCW91xQF0P4mmFTH3CEY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ct=result#PPA288,M1\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://camresb.blogspot.com/2005/04/sports-biscuits-issue.html\">here</a>)</p> <p>The demands of CRS 2008 are few and reasonable.</p> <p>1) The removal of all pre-recorded music and non-emergency PA announcements from live games in order to facilitate and encourage genuine crowd culture.<br>2) The removal of electronic advertising hoardings and all other electronic distractions. (\"And that big McDonalds M at Anfield,\" says my wife.) <br>3) A mandatory redistribution of 70 percent - no, 90 percent - of all broadcast moneys into grass-roots sports, with 95 percent of that going directly into women's soccer. <br>4) The removal of all time outs, advertising breaks and other time-wasting artificial intervals that ruin so many sports as live spectacles.<br>5) The removal of different teams for attack and defence in American football. <br>6) Public kickings for feigners of injury in soccer, carried out by the referee's assistant. <br>7) Referee's assistants to be called linesmen or lineswomen. <br>8) Tennis matches to be first to 11, best out of three, as in table tennis. (\"With no grunting,\" says my mother-in-law.)<br>9) All US team franchises to be entirely reliant on the team never changing its geographical location.<br>10) All TV advertising restricted to half time.<br>11) No quarter times.<br>12) The removal of all on-screen advertising from televised games.<br>13) No cross-sport promotion or product placement, like ESPN's poor bloody Euro 90 commentators being forced to talk about basketball.<br>14) Only real ale or decent micro-brews to be sold at live games. <br>15) Only real ale or decent micro-brews allowed to advertise at games. <br>16) Only real ale or decent micro-brews allowed as shirt sponsors.<br>17) All club merchandise to be hand-knitted by the players (for 15 cents an hour and all the rice and rat meat they can eat).<br>18) All club chairmen, owners and shareholders to sustain the same level of fitness as the players, and to be charged entrance to games at a percentage-of-income rate comparable to that paid by the average earning fan. <br>19) In the Premier League there should be \"standing areas\" patrolled by gangs of psychotic feral skinheads where sad middle class nostalgists can recreate the 'good old days' when attending a football match was a life-threatening experience. <br>20) A total ban on cheerleaders; Frisbee-catching dogs; hot-dog and T-shirt firing cannons; competitions with a giant bar of chocolate as a prize; fat-suit sumo wrestling; erotic dancing lessons for children; pleas to \"make some noise\"; the playing of celebratory club anthems after every home-team goal; and all other \"entertainments\" that assume the spectator is a sexist moron with the attention span, imagination and self-organisational skills of a gnat. <br>21) The games of basketball and American football to be speeded up until the players actually sweat. <br>22) The compulsory demolition of all corporate boxes. <br>23) Through gradual and progressive rule and equipment changes, American football and rugby union to both become rugby league within five seasons. <br>24) Franchises to be removed from all US teams whose fans fail - within the space of five seasons - to come up with at least three original songs and five reasonably witty original chants. <br>25) The Premier League to be taken over by the FA - at gunpoint if necessary. <br>26) All American leagues to have compulsory relegation and demotion. All British leagues to have the draft and salary caps and big shouty men with buzzcuts who never sit down or speak in a normal voice. <br>27) All US broadcasters to be forbidden from saying \"the EPL\", \"the Prem\", \"pee kays\" and \"offsides\". </p> <p>Well there you have it. Those are my ideas. What are yours? Perhaps you think we should ban all women from football grounds except those with headscarves and big rattles, like in the good old days. Maybe you think all policing should be done by bobbies on white horses. Or we should get rid of the ban on shoulder charging the goalie. We've all got our opinions. I'm paid for mine while yours are literally worthless. But don't let that stop you. </p> <p>Remember - they're your sports, and it's up to you to keep them real.</p>",

Hell, we wouldn't even be making this blog post today if not for the fact that every time we even mention the film's title our unique users figure immediately quadruples.

  "<p>I've heard it before, but there's a particularly good version of it in <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/79320788-794e-11dd-9d0c-000077b07658.html?nclick_check=1\">Sue Cameron's column in the FT today</a> \u2013 the theory that politicians ultimately fail not because of what they are bad at, but because of what they are good at.</p> <p>She attributes it to Peter Hennessy, the doyen of contemporary historians. I'm sure other people have thought of this too, but Hennessy's an inspiration to anyone who studies modern politics, so I can't begrudge him taking the credit.</p> <blockquote> <p>Professor Hennessy says PMs often fail in the very areas where they have expertise: Eden, the foreign affairs expert, faced Suez; Callaghan, son of the Labour movement, had the winter of discontent; Thatcher, champion of the ratepayers, came to grief over poll tax. Will the economy prove Mr Brown's nemesis?</p> </blockquote> <p>It's a good thesis, and there are other names you could add to the list:</p> <p>Tony Blair \u2013 who came to power partly because he was brilliant at handling the media, but who was subsequently derided for being obsessed with spin.</p> <p>John Major \u2013 who was applauded as a consensus politician when he replaced Thatcher, but who ultimately presided over a massive party split.</p> <p>(A ministerial colleague of Major's once told me: \"When he became prime minister, we thought he would be good for the party but not so good for the country. In fact it turned out the other way round.\" Quite a neat verdict.)</p> <p>There must be others. Can you think of any more?</p> <p>The theory actually seems to cover two categories of failure: politicians who are rightly acclaimed for their expertise in an area, and who then muck up fantastically (like Eden), and politicians who are acclaimed for a particular skill, but who then find, as the world changes, that what used to be perceived as a positive becomes perceived as a negative (like Blair).</p> <p>Brown's situation seems to combine a bit of both. He's made economic mistakes, particularly over scrapping the 10p tax band, as he's admitted. </p> <p>But I suspect that his real problem is that, at a time when he was only part-responsible for what seemed like never-ending growth (the rest of it, frankly, was global economics and luck), he was happy to take 100% of the credit. Now, in a downturn over which he has precious little control, he's getting 100% of the blame.</p> <p>Incidentally, Hennessy has also told Cameron that he does not have a lot of faith in the ability of Brown's staff to help him recover.</p> <blockquote> <p>'If you think this lot have a Baldrick-style cunning plan you are flattering them,' says Professor Peter Hennessy of London University. 'A lot of the people in No 10 - notably the spads or special advisers - aren't house-trained. They don't know what everyone is meant to be doing.'</p> </blockquote> <p>.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diazepam\">Diazepam</a> tranquillisers (formerly marketed as Valium) have always been part of the UK's street drug scene. They regularly feature in the list of drugs used by those with serious drug problems, alongside heroin, crack and alcohol. Most users take diazepam that has been prescribed by their GP. But there has been a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/feedarticle/7770204\">significant increase</a> in the availability of this drug on the streets in recent months. So what's going on?</p> <p>Well, it isn't the fault of UK GPs. Instead, people have been bringing the drug in from Europe in suitcases, although how they are able to do this is unclear. Certainly you cannot walk into chemists in EU countries and buy this drug over the counter without a prescription. The best guess is that either these drugs are being stolen from wholesale pharmacies or perhaps those in charge are turning a blind eye to irregular bulk sales. The drug is also available online from suppliers in the far east where there is a notorious lack of quality control. You might take a blue diazepam pill from India, but what's in it is anybody's guess. </p> <p>The other reason that these drugs are popular at the moment in some parts of the UK is linked to a current shortage of heroin \u2013 or a drop in heroin purity, which amounts to the same thing. On the face of it, this doesn't make sense. With one <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/24/afghanistan.drugstrade\">bumper opium harvest</a> from Afghanistan following another, surely we should be treading on the stuff?</p> <p>In truth, there are always localised fluctuations in supply and quality of heroin, but this does seem to be more widespread than usual \u2013 and what it shows is that the illicit drug market is more complex than people think. In this case, there have been some significant seizures in Turkey, a growing market for heroin in China and Russia, logistical problems in moving large quantities of heroin and opium around war-torn Afghanistan and the need to find other, longer routes into Europe, for example, via west Africa. None of these factors by themselves would make much difference, but taken together they can have an impact on UK supplies, albeit a short-term one.</p> <p>So does less, or less pure, heroin equal good news? It does drive some people towards treatment in search of a methadone prescription, but it also encourages more injecting to make supplies go further and there is a risk of overdosing when purity levels come back up while tolerance to the drug has gone down. </p> <p>But diazepam as a heroin substitute presents its own problems. The drug is highly addictive, withdrawals can be life-threatening and, as with heroin, there is a high risk of overdose if mixed with alcohol. There is also some evidence from the <a href=\"http://www.drugscope.org.uk/ourwork/pressoffice/pressreleases/Street-drug-trends-08.htm\">DrugScope survey</a> that cheap diazepam mixed with alcohol is proving attractive to some young people who these days seem to favour more the pick 'n' mix drug culture of booze, pills and dope than the long straight track to heroin.</p>",
  "<p>Pupils starting secondary school in England this week are expected to be the first cohort legally obliged to stay on in education or training until 17.</p> <p>Legislation is going through parliament to raise the school leaving age to 17 by 2013 and to 18 by 2015, moves opposition parties have labelled a \"sledgehammer\" approach.</p> <p>This is just one of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/sep/01/diplomas.alevels.explained\">many changes</a> facing schools this year.</p> <p>The curriculum for 11- to 14-year-olds has been updated and improved, with more emphasis on personal, learning and thinking skills.</p> <p>This week will also see the first students starting the government's diploma qualification, established by ministers to rival A-levels.</p> <p>Universities have been slow to embrace the new qualifications. However, University College London said today that it would consider diploma students for its courses, which means all but one university in the Russell group have released statements saying they will consider applicants with the qualification.</p> <p>Imperial College London has said it will consider the qualifications but has reservations about whether the content will prepare students for degree courses.</p> <p>At a visit to Newham College, which will offer the diploma, the schools secretary, Ed Balls, said: \"Education is all about opportunities - a good education opens doors. It is the single best way for anyone, regardless of background, to do well and to gain the skills they need to succeed at whatever they want to do.</p> <p>\"We have made great inroads in this area and we now have more young people staying on post-16 than ever before, with record GCSE and A-level results.</p> <p>\"But there is always more to do, especially if we want the most disadvantaged to be able to fulfil their full potential. Our reforms are all about ensuring this happens.\"</p> <p>He added: \"I want to see a situation where every single young person has a range of interesting, exciting and challenging options ahead of them at every stage of their education, so that they never feel tempted to drop out or give up. This year will see some of the biggest steps towards this goal yet.\"</p> <p>Every school leaver will now be guaranteed the offer of a place in post-16 education or training through the <a href=\"http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/14-19/index.cfm?sid=42&amp;pid=347&amp;ctype=TEXT&amp;ptype=Single\">\"September Guarantee\"</a>. </p> <p>Teenagers will be able to enrol on one-year, or short courses, and may qualify for the Education Maintenance Allowance (EMA) for as long as they progress.</p> <p>But the Liberal Democrat schools spokesman, David Laws, said: \"There is a real problem with young people who do not stay on in education beyond 16, but it is typical of this government to think the answer to the problem is to pass a new law rather than dealing with the causes.</p> <p>\"This sledgehammer approach could damage the interests of some children who are presently able to go into employment at 16. Opportunities may be lost given the bureaucratic burdens the government is imposing on businesses.</p> <p>\"Ministers ought to be focusing on tackling the causes of educational failure, which are the real reasons young people end up leaving education at 16.\"</p> <p>Anne Pinney, assistant director of policy and research at the charity Barnardo's, said: \"The success of increasing the age at which young people must remain in education or training will depend on the delivery of a far stronger vocational offer and more work-based learning, for the one in five young people who currently leave school at 16.</p> <p>\"Our experience tells us that well-supported vocational training can motivate young people who have had a poor time at school, getting them back on track towards future achievement.\"</p>",

  "<p>\"If it wasn't for Wednesday\" was Frankfurter Allgemeine's cynical take on the third round of matches in this season's Bundesliga, which came shortly after a poor midweek showing for German clubs in European competition. What good, the paper wondered, were full stadiums, thrilling attacking football and 33 goals in domestic competition when Schalke 04, the league leaders, had meekly rolled over and become Schalke 0-4 against Atletico Madrid in the Champions League qualifiers? \"What will other countries think about our football now?\" </p> <p>What indeed? The easy, comforting answer is that Schalke will always be Schalke: world experts in gutless defeats; bigger bottlers than Coca Cola; overpaid underachievers. And in the Bundesliga's defence, we could also point out that Bayer Leverkusen versus Hoffenheim on Saturday, the meeting of the two youngest teams in the competition, was an unadulterated orgy of free-flowing football and quite probably the most entertaining match played in Europe last weekend. Bruno Labbadia's hugely talented Bayer side \u2013 and the Brazilian midfielder Renato Augusto in particular \u2013 overcame a Hoffenheim team that still managed to look pretty good despite conceding five goals.</p> <p>As a result of that 5-2 goal-fest in the BayArena, Schalke could at least console themselves with going into the international break at the top of the table. A solid 1-0 win at home to VfL Bochum brought some closure after the Royal Blue nightmare in Madrid, although not for the Brazilian right-back Rafinha, who faces a huge fine after absconding to the Olympics despite the club's wishes and is rapidly turning into a pantomime villain. Booed by his own fans for missing the first weeks of the season, the diminutive 22-year-old smugly applauded the sending off of Bochum's Christian Fuchs in the last minute of the match to rile the opposition too. \"This little gnome is really getting on my nerves,\" was the Bochum midfielder Mimoun Azaouagh's take on the matter. \"He's asking for other players to be booked but goes down every time the wind blows.\" </p> <p>The VfL defender Marcel Maltritz also joined the debate: \"It drives you mad when a little mercenary is constantly calling for yellow cards.\" As opposed to a tall German player doing the same thing, which would have been all right, presumably.</p> <p>Hamburg, meanwhile, slated by some sections of the media not long ago as cod-eating Northern surrender monkeys in the wake of Rafael van der Vaart's enforced sale to Real Madrid, have reinvented themselves as big-spending title candidates in the space of three days. After the eyebrow-raising capture of the German left-back Marcell Jansen from Bayern Munich for a sum reported to be \u20ac8m, they raised the stakes by shelling out another \u20ac19m for the centre-back Alex Silva and the playmaker Thiago Neves, both members of Brazil's bronze-winning Beijing squad. Martin Jol's side made hard work of <a href=\"http://www.101greatgoals.com/videodisplay/1521313/\">overcoming Bielefeld 4-2 away</a> but they'll be a force to reckon with as the season unfolds. They could also conceivably win the Uefa Cup \u2013 Milan might not be bothered \u2013 in a final against Schalke. No, really.</p> <p>Down south, the Bayern general manager Uli Hoene\u00df advised journalists not to talk about tactics too much. \"Because you don't understand them,\" he explained. An interesting comment, especially in the wake of an impressive <a href=\"http://www.101greatgoals.com/videodisplay/1522150/\">4-1 demolition of hapless Hertha Berlin</a>, J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann's first win of the campaign. The new Bayern coach had lined up his team in an unfashionable 3-5-2 formation, which according to a bemused S\u00fcddeutsche, was \"so old it almost looked radically new\". Against Hertha, who also played with three at the back, it ultimately didn't matter \u2013 Luca Toni et al were always going to be too strong. Hoene\u00df's grumblings, however, suggest that the board are perhaps not entirely sold on this counter-revolution on the pitch. Maybe Klinsmann just enjoys being contrary for the sake of it.</p> <p>All very interesting, you'll agree. And it would have remained the most interesting talking point if Der Spiegel magazine hadn't published a story that blew everything else out of the water: a new betting scandal is threatening to engulf the Bundesliga. A middle-aged Malaysian man with grey hair and stomach ulcers, named William Lee Wah Lim, is alleged to have fixed the outcomes of at least one Bundesliga match and a 2. Bundesliga game (the second flight) in 2005.</p> <p>Following a tip-off from a player who said he'd been contacted about rigging a match, German law enforcement authorities tapped Lim's phones in Baden-Baden in the autumn of 2006. In December he was arrested along with two co-conspirators and a few months later a judge in Frankfurt convicted them for fraud in connection with fixed matches in the Regionalliga (then Germany's third division) and the Austrian league. Lim then skipped his bail. But instead of buying a Premier League club, he went underground.</p> <p>Der Spiegel says it has since gained access to troubling evidence of other possible fixes that weren't part of the trial at the time. Hours of recorded Skype conversations and internet chats are said to reveal that Lim had bet nearly \u20ac2.2m on Kaiserslautern losing away to Hanover in November 2005. They did - after what were described as some terrible defensive mistakes, it ended 4-1 to 96. Kaiserslautern were relegated at the end of the season. All Lautern players have naturally denied any wrong-doing but Marco Engelhardt, captain at the time, admitted that they were \"Schweinetruppe\", a dodgy team, to Spiegel. And Lim had allegedly been going to casinos with Kaiserslautern players.</p> <p>Der Spiegel also alleges that Lim bet nearly \u20ac4m on Karlsruhe beating Siegen by two clear goals in the 2. Bundesliga match in August 2005. End result: 2-0.</p> <p>The league and German FA have promised to look into these sensational allegations. While Hanover's president Martin Kind fears a \"catastrophe\", most club officials prefer to voice incredulity. These things aren't supposed to happen in Germany, certainly not after the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2005/nov/18/newsstory.sport4\">bent referee Robert Hoyzer was caught</a>. Lim's story poses a much more worrying question than Schalke's failure in the Champions League. What good are full stadiums, thrilling attacking football and plenty of goals if the results are being predetermined somewhere between Manila and Kuala Lumpur?</p> <p><strong>Results:</strong> Karlsruhe 0-2 K\u00f6ln, Schalke 1-0 Bochum, Wolfburg 2-2 Frankfurt, Gladbach 3-2 Bremen, Leverkusen 5-2 Hoffenheim, Cottbus 0-1 Dortmund, Bielefeld 2-4 Hamburg, Bayern 4-1 Hertha, Stuttgart 2-0 Hanover</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/bundesligafootball/tables\">Click here to see the latest Bundesliga table</a></p>",

  "<p>The head of Japan's embattled national sport of sumo faced calls to resign today after two wrestlers, including one of his proteges, tested positive for marijuana.</p> <p>The Japan sumo association said urine tests conducted at several stables yesterday revealed marijuana use by the Russian siblings Roho and Hakurozan.</p> <p>The revelation of drug use among sportsmen known for their Spartan training methods and supposedly disciplined lifestyle is a huge embarrassment for the sumo authorities.</p> <p>It comes a fortnight after another Russian, Wakanoho, became the first sumo wrestler to be expelled in the sport's 2,000-year-history. Police found a marijuana cigarette in his wallet, which had been handed in after he dropped it on the street.</p> <p>Wakanoho, 20, was arrested after admitting he had bought a small quantity of the drug in Roppongi, a notorious entertainment district in Tokyo. A pipe used for smoking cannabis was found in his apartment.</p> <p>Today's revelations managed to knock the political fallout from prime minister Yasuo Fukuda's sudden resignation off the top of the TV news agenda.</p> <p>The sumo association said it had carried out surprise tests on all 69 wrestlers in sumo's top two divisions. Only Roho, 28, whose real name the association gave as Boradzov Soslan Feliksovich, and Hakurozan, 26, tested positive, officials said.</p> <p>\"It is possible that they inhaled very recently, probably within the last two days,\" said Shohei Onishi, a sumo anti-doping official.</p> <p>Hakurozan, whose real name is Baradzov Batraz Feliksovich, is coached by Kitanoumi, a retired grand champion who now heads the sumo association.</p> <p>Both wrestlers denied smoking marijuana. \"I have never used or even touched the stuff,\" Roho told reporters. \"I want another test to be conducted at a hospital I can trust.\"</p> <p>His younger brother said he was confident that further tests would clear his name. \"I don't mind of they investigate me or test me,\" Hakurozan said. \"I'm confident that I definitely won't test positive.\"</p> <p>Although possession of marijuana is punishable by up to five years in prison, Japanese law carries no penalty for simply smoking it.</p> <p>Sumo authorities are under mounting pressure to show zero tolerance towards drug use as it battles to salvage its already tarnished reputation.</p> <p>The ancient sport was rocked earlier this year by the arrest of Junichi Yamamoto, a stable master, on assault charges following accusations that he had ordered the beating by three of his wrestlers of a 17-year-old trainee in June last year. The victim collapsed and died the following day.</p> <p>Sumo elders have also had to fend off accusations of match fixing and have been ordered to clamp down on the widespread physical abuse of younger wrestlers.</p> <p>Last year the association banned Asashoryu, one of two reigning \"yokozuna\" - grand champions - for two tournaments after he was filmed playing in a charity football match in his native Mongolia, despite pulling out of a goodwill sumo claiming to be injured.</p> <p>Even so, sumo authorities will find it hard to resist charges that it singles out foreign wrestlers for harsh punishments for what many consider minor misdemeanours.</p> <p>While Asashoryu was forced to sit on the sidelines for three months, Toki, a Japanese wrestler who struck and killed a pedestrian while driving in Osaka in 2000, was banned for just one tournament.</p> <p>Police said they would examine further test samples from Roho and Hakurozan. The results are expected within the next few days. A second positive result would make it almost impossible for Kitanoumi to stay in his post.</p> <p>Mitsuru Yaku, a fellow sumo association member, told a TV interviewer that it was \"natural\" that Kitanoumi would be sacked, adding that he believed more damaging revelations were on the way. \"I don't think for a moment that all of the puss has come out,\" he said.</p> <p>Kitanoumi, 55, still holds the record as the youngest wrestler to attain the vaunted yokozuna status, at the age of 21 years and two months.</p>",
  "<p>The either/or question might seem like the preserve of the inane pub bore, but it is used with disconcerting frequency and can insidiously shape perceptions. Blur or Oasis? Pepsi or Coke? PCs or Macs? Jez or Mark? The Sopranos or The Wire? Spit or Bob Carolgees? And, for those who have ever watched football on the BBC, particularly in the mid-1990s, John Motson or Barry Davies?</p> <p>For a while, even the BBC suits couldn't make up their mind: after more than a decade of having Motson as the undisputed No1, they gave Davies his first World Cup final in 1994, and then gave him two FA Cup finals in 1995-96, before normal service was resumed.</p> <p>Davies, then, was destined to spend almost all of a hugely distinguished career in the shadows. Yet the suspicion remains that, of the post-Coleman brigade of football commentators, he might just have been the best of the lot. He was certainly infinitely superior to the current, barely distinguishable shower. For me, hearing him in action again at the Olympics came behind only Usain Bolt in the list of highlights. Yet at the same time some will have reached for the mute button. </p> <p>Davies was always something of a Marmite figure, a man whose \"woefully judgmental sermonising\", to quote one <a href=\"http://www.est1892.co.uk/forums/archive/index.php/t-19423.html\">internet forum commentator</a>, and unashamedly middle-class nature made him unlistenable to the archetypal football fan. Yet Davies's background has nothing to do with anything. He \"felt\" football as acutely as anyone, and many found his sporadic crankiness an integral part of his overall charm, like an endearing, eccentric uncle predisposed to unprompted expressions of contempt for modern society from behind an impenetrable fug of pipe smoke.</p> <p>This is not to criticise Motson, who for most of his career was a superb broadcaster. But Davies simply had more going for him. Davies wore baldness with a roguish majesty; Motson wore a sheepskin. Davies had a wonderfully expressive, almost operatic voice; Motson spoke like someone whose mouth had been invaded by Chewits. Davies focused on detail, narrative and character; Motson often commentated by numbers in more than one sense. Davies was chic; Motson a geek. Davies, like Richie Benaud, spoke little and often; Motson spoke lots and often. Davies, you imagined, had a dictionary by his side; Motson probably had a Rothmans.</p> <p>Davies, like all the best commentators, also had unique flourishes. Coleman's \"one-nil\" became his trademark, yet for some reason Davies's equally catchy and succinct \"so-and-sooooo... scores!\" never really caught on. Nor did his oft-used \"lovely goal!\" (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdOUS5tQ3Qw\">goal C on this video</a>, for example), which had the effect of making you feel that just you and Bazza had witnessed something of almost unprecedented aesthetic appeal.</p> <p>He also affectingly referred to games as \"contests\", to tournaments as \"competitions\", and to a \"penalty competition\" rather than the unnecessarily dramatic \"penalty shoot-out\". This was the thing with Davies: he cared enormously about language, and he was free of the hype and guff that marks almost all of today's coverage. He wouldn't have lasted five syllables, never mind five minutes, on Sky. Davies rarely got overexcited, so when he did you knew it was the real thing: \"And Leeds will go mad... and they've every right to go mad!\" (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPamaSbK5xM&amp;feature=related\">right at the end of this</a> video) or his finest hour: \"Interesting... very interesting... <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMmQk2lK_Ks\">Look at his face! Just look at his face!</a>\".</p> <p>Not that Davies was without flaws. Big deal. Sometimes his brain would move faster than his tongue, as during solo goals by Diego Maradona in 1986 (when \"he doesn't need them\" became \"he dudnedem\") and Ryan Giggs in 1992 (when \"beautiful\" and \"brilliant\" morphed into the Bernard Matthews-style \"broodiful\"). He had a shocker in the 1995 FA Cup final, at the worst possible time, and many found that his schoolmasterly reprimands to errant players were not to their taste. Others found them hilarious. How could you not, for example, laugh at this <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgXbz8F_nLw\"> heartfelt reprimand to Terry Fenwick</a>, beginning as it does with a simple 'Ach!'.</p> <p>There was also a perception that Davies could be a cold fish, too detached to fully engage the viewer. Yet that doesn't really stand up to the fact that two of his signature commentaries came during matches between England and Germany: \"And where were the Germans? And quite frankly, who cares?\" during the Olympic hockey final of 1988, and the simple, and simply perfect, \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mu4pGNwoxzY&amp;feature=related\">OH NO!</a>\" when Gareth Southgate's penalty was saved at Euro 96.</p> <p>Davies's decency also shone through in and out of the gantry. In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/oct/19/smalltalk.sportinterviews\">interviews</a>, he was humble and rarely took himself seriously. This sounds obvious but is anything but when dealing with media figures. He wasn't quite a Dan Ashcroft among Nathan Barleys, but he was still emphatically one of the good guys.<br>He was also, effortlessly and by some distance, the coolest commentator of his generation. He made baldness more than okay. And whereas Motson appeared in <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0424095/\">Flushed Away</a>, Davies appeared on <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWgg20IqibM\">Big Train</a>. Surely not even Motson's greatest fans would offer that up as an either/or.</p>",

Alongside them is a newly-painted sign in large Arabic lettering which reads: \"Occupation and corruption are two faces of one coin.\"</p> <p>Last Monday, Khader, 47, was one of 198 security prisoners released by the Israeli authorities as a gesture towards the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas. It was the third prisoner release since the latest and still fruitless peace negotiations began a year ago. </p> <p>Apart from two long-serving prisoners, most of those freed last week were young men jailed for attacks on the Israeli military or settlers and who were close to finishing their sentences. But the release of Khader was unexpected. He was a prominent youth leader in the Fatah movement, which is led by Abbas, and a former Palestinian legislator who became an outspoken critic of the late Yasser Arafat and the corruption that surrounded him at the top of the Fatah movement and the Palestinian leadership.</p> <p>Khader is one of several men in a younger generation of Fatah leaders who command support on the streets and who are pushing for major reform within the movement. He still rails against Fatah corruption, though it remains to be seen whether in the months ahead he can bring any significant change to a situation in stalemate. Since his release, thousands of supporters have descended on his small home in the Balata camp, in Nablus, to talk about the future at a time of deep division between the two leading Palestinian factions, Fatah and Hamas, and deadlock in the peace negotiations.</p> <p>\"The situation has got worse because of the separation and fighting between Fatah and Hamas,\" Khader said. \"We don't have a state yet, but we have two heads in this state and this will push us back to square one in our struggle. It's a very, very dangerous point that we have reached.\"</p> <p>Khader was arrested at his home in March 2003 and convicted of being a member of the al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, the armed wing of the Fatah movement that played a key role in the second intifada, and of helping fund the group through connections to Hizbullah and Iran. He was sentenced to seven years in jail but released after five and a half. It was his 24th time in an Israeli prison - he was first arrested at age 13 for taking part in a demonstration against the Israeli occupation.</p> <p>While he was inside, Fatah lost its dominance to its Islamist rival Hamas, which won elections in 2006 and then took full control of Gaza last year after a near civil war between the two factions. Both sides seem a very long way from returning to an agreement to govern together.</p> <p>\"Hamas missed a historic opportunity to lead the Palestinian people,\" he said. \"They fell into a trap and acted in a cruel and bad way towards the Palestinian people to defend their project.\" Yet, in the past week several senior Hamas leaders, including the deposed prime minister Ismail Haniyeh, have telephoned Khader to celebrate his release. At the same time, he said, problems within Fatah had worsened. \"The corruption is more organised now,\" he said. \"We repeat our mistakes. We never criticise our own experience.\"</p> <p>Others regarded as the young guard in Fatah make a similar argument, the most prominent among them Marwan Barghouti, a leader of the Fatah armed wing who was jailed a year before Khader and who remains in prison. Khader, who said he spent time in talks with Barghouti when they were in the same jails, argues for a new unity government with Hamas and rebuilding of his Fatah movement and says the Palestinians should work towards a two-state peace agreement with the Israelis. \"We can change our situation. We can choose our destiny by ourselves and our failed leaders are not our destiny,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>Heritage Open Days announced its biggest programme to date yesterday, with almost 3,600 usually off-limits heritage sites opening their doors next week.</p> <p>Curiosity seekers will be able to tour the workshops that maintain Blackpool's illuminations, take tea in the country's first works canteen for women only, and watch a rugby match with one team kitted out exactly as players would have been in 1885. </p> <p>The eccentric and hugely enjoyable series of Heritage Open Days, which runs from September 11-14, has enlisted schools, military bunkers and three \"faith trails\" to churches, mosques and temples in Birmingham alone. Visitors will also be able to clamber down into caves, check out private \"eco-homes\" and join a queue at the oldest-surviving branch of Barclay's bank. </p> <p>\"This is the largest single cultural event of the year,\" said Maria Adebowale, a commissioner for English Heritage, whose staff, together with the Civic Trust and local authorities, will provide 35,000 voluntary guides over the four days. \"More than a million people from across the country are expected to take part, while owners and operators of the buildings share their pride and passion for local heritage.\" </p> <p>She described the range of sites in the 15th programme since the idea was launched as Britain's contribution to a European initiative. The scheme has now swollen to involve 49 countries including Azerbaijan and Montenegro. </p> <p>Margaret Hodge, minister for culture, tourism and the creative industries, said: \"The great thing about Heritage Open Days is that there really is something for everyone. Whether it's the private homes of individuals, or places that fascinate and delight because of what happens there, it's a once-a-year chance to be surprised and, often, amazed.\" </p> <p>Visitors, who need to pre-book for many of the sites, also have their chance to add to history. Experts remain divided on whether bones in Banwell Caves, near Weston-super-Mare, really could date back to the supposed time of Noah's flood. Veterans of the second world war who tour Fighter Command's old HQ at Bentley Priory in Stanmore will be encouraged to add to oral history recordings. </p> <p>Blackpool's tour of the illuminations workshops, which will be replaced this winter by a more modern complex, are not the grand old resort's only offering. Parties are also being offered tours of the clubhouse and private theatre of Blackpool Magic Club, plus the chance to watch \"live tricks (without giving away the secrets)\".</p> <p>A number of other events offer access to heritage sites this month. London Open House takes place on September 20-21. Open Doors Days in Scotland runs every weekend in September. Open Doors Days in Wales takes place on September 6-7, 13-14 and 20-21. European Heritage Days Northern Ireland runs on September 13-14.

  "<p>Yousaf Raza Gilani, a Benazir Bhutto loyalist who was jailed for five years by the former president Pervez Musharraf, became Pakistan's prime minister in March.</p> <p>A stalwart of the Pakistan People's party, he comes from a prominent family of landowners in Multan, in southern Punjab, where the party needs to increase its vote.</p> <p>Gilani, 56, served part of his political apprenticeship through a long stretch in prison. He was jailed on politically slanted corruption charges in 2001 and released in 2006. He was accused of handing sinecures to supporters during his tenure as speaker of parliament.</p> <p>Immediately after taking office, Gilani ordered the release of 60 judges who had been detained by Musharraf since November. When Musharraf stood down as president last month, Gilani hailed it as the end of Pakistan's \"period of oppression\".</p> <p>In characteristically soft-spoken tones, he said: \"We can hold our head up high in the world and say that we too are a democracy.\"</p> <p>His appointment was regarded as a stop-gap measure and a compromise aimed at calming the debate between the four parties of Pakistan's ruling coalition.</p> <p>His low profile fueled speculation that his role was to keep the prime minister's seat warm for Bhutto's widower, Asif Ali Zardari.</p> <p>The US regards Gilani as a weak figure who does not control the military and intelligence apparatus put in place by Musharraf. On a trip to Washington in July, he failed to convince the Bush administration that his government could control the violence in the tribal areas and stand up to the Taliban and al-Qaida.</p> <p>When he took office, Gilani warned George Bush in a phone conversation that he would prioritise talking as well as fighting in the battle against Islamist extremism.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidcameron\">David Cameron</a> today appeared to criticise Washington's handling of the invasion of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq\">Iraq</a> when he attacked the \"neocon\" approach to trying to impose democracy on foreign countries.</p> <p>In a speech in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/pakistan\">Pakistan</a>, he said that he advocated \"liberal Conservatism\" and that this involved respecting national traditions.</p> <p>\"We should accept that we cannot impose democracy at the barrel of a gun; that we cannot drop democracy from 10,000 feet and we shouldn't try.</p> <p>\"Put crudely, that was what was wrong with the 'neocon' approach and why I am a liberal Conservative, not a neoconservative.\"</p> <p>\"A liberal Conservative approach recognises that democracy must be built around the institutions, habits and culture of each country.</p> <p>\"Democracy should be the work of patient craftmanship and not of a uniform mass production line, if the final product is to be of a quality that endures.\"</p> <p>In the initial copy of the speech released to the media, Cameron did not explicitly refer to President Bush or the invasion of Iraq.</p> <p>But the war was widely blamed on the influence of so-called \"neo cons\" in the Bush administration, such as Paul Wolfowitz and Douglas Feith, who were both senior figures in the Pentagon at the time of the invasion.</p> <p>The word \"neo con\" originally applied to liberals who moved to the right - who thus became \"neoconservatives\" \u2013 although it was often used as a description of the Bush administration as a whole.</p> <p>In his speech, Cameron said that democracy was a universal value, not just a western one.</p> <p>He went on: \"Those of us who believe in the goal of spreading democracy need to explain why we believe this is important.</p> <p>\"For me, democracy is not just a goal in itself.</p> <p>\"It is our best available mechanism for lasting good government that delivers economic, social and environmental progress.</p> <p>\"Democracies tend not to go to war with each other.</p> <p>\"Democracies offer a structure in which differences - including territorial and ethnic disputes - can be debated and resolved.</p> <p>\"Democracy gives every citizen a say.</p> <p>\"But the case for democracy needs to be remade and refreshed in every generation.</p> <p>\"Because there are always powerful forces which seek to stifle the universal human hunger for freedom.\"</p> <p>Cameron, who flew to Pakistan after visiting British troops in Afghanistan, was holding meetings with a series of political figures. The country has been in turmoil since the resignation of its president, Pervez Musharraf, last month.</p> <p>In his speech, Cameron said it was important for Britain and Pakistan to unite in the war against terror.</p> <p>\"We need your continued cooperation on counter-terrorism and we need to be sure that all your governmental agencies are fully committed to this goal,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Because and I say this not in a spirit of recrimination - it is on your commitment to delivering these goals that Pakistan's international reputation will depend.</p> <p>\"So for your own sake, as well as ours, this is an issue on which there is no room for ambivalence. Since democracy does indeed require the rule of law it must also involve unrelenting efforts to defeat terrorism.</p> <p>\"But when I say we need each other I mean it.</p> <p>\"We are in this together, as equal partners, two sovereign countries working shoulder to shoulder to deal with a problem that affects us both.</p> <p>\"It must be a partnership that takes proper account of local sensitivities and cultures; a cooperation which implements solutions both our countries can get behind.\"</p> <p>Cameron said Britain, for its part, also needed to do more to combat terrorism, by tackling extremism and enforcing laws properly.</p>",
  "<p>It's amazing the excuses some people will come out with. Take Pakistani politician Israr Ullah Zehri for example, who last week in Pakistan's senate tried to justify the so-called honour killings of five women by Baluch tribesmen by <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/us_world/2008/08/30/2008-08-30_5_buried_alive_tradition__pakistani_pol-2.html\">saying that</a>: \"These are centuries-old traditions, and I will continue to defend them.\" Zehri allegedly went on to tell the stunned parliament that they could spare him their outrage, and that \"We will not let anyone interfere with this.\" His message to another politician who tried to raise the subject was to \"keep quiet\".</p> <p>Keep quiet when <a href=\"http://www.paktribune.com/news/index.shtml?204881\">five women</a> have been beaten, shot, and then buried alive in a ditch? I don't think so.</p> <p>It was back in July that the women were abducted at gunpoint from a house in the village of Baba Kot in Baluchistan province, driven to a remote area and then murdered. Their crime? They were about to leave for a civil court so that the three younger women, all teenagers between the ages of 16 and 18, could marry men they had chosen for themselves. The two older women accompanying them were apparently the mother of one, and the aunt of another.</p> <p>According to the <a href=\"http://www.ahrchk.net/ua/mainfile.php/2008/2969/\">Asian Human Rights Commission</a>, which launched an appeal calling for an investigation into the case early in August, the women had been in discussion for several days with tribal elders, seeking permission from them to marry. This permission had been denied, and when news of the plan to ignore the elders and go ahead with their weddings leaked out, the tribesmen decided to deal with these uppity women in their own unique \"traditional\" way.</p> <p>So a group of men turned up at the house, dragged the women off at gunpoint, and drove them away in a government car. When they arrived at their destination the three younger women were lined up, beaten, and shot. Then, while they were still alive, they were thrown into a ditch and buried. The two older women were forced to witness this outrage, and when they couldn't manage to hold their silence any longer they too were shot and buried alive.</p> <p>And Israr Ullah Zehri thinks we should all keep quiet about it, don't interfere, and just accept that this kind of barbarity is a tribal tradition. No doubt he'll be expecting us to \"respect\" this tradition next: after all, the deputy chairman of the senate, <a href=\"http://www.hindustantimes.com/StoryPage/StoryPage.aspx?sectionName=&amp;id=a4ae9484-238e-4e0e-b3c1-e149e0394eb1&amp;MatchID1=4733&amp;TeamID1=2&amp;TeamID2=3&amp;MatchType1=2&amp;SeriesID1=1193&amp;PrimaryID=4733&amp;Headline=Buried+alive%3a+Pak+orders+probe&amp;strParent=strParentID\">Jan Jamali</a> does. Jamali refused to pass comment when the subject was being discussed in parliament, alleging that as it was \"part of Baluch traditions\" he couldn't say anything about it because one tribe doesn't comment on the actions of another.</p> <p>This attitude doesn't seem to be unusual in Pakistan. In <a href=\"http://www.shirkatgah.org/the%20dark%20side%20of%20honour%20-%20bulletin%202001.pdf\">The Dark Side of Honour (pdf)</a> Rabia Ali writes:</p> <blockquote> <p>In the perpetuation of honour killing as custom and practice, the role of the local waderos or sardars (tribal chiefs or feudal lords, usually both) cannot be underestimated. For the most part, the sardars support the custom as an essential constituent of their tradition. Many of these gentlemen are well-educated and well-travelled; many sit in the country's parliament (when it is not 'suspended') as representatives of the people and serve in the government as cabinet ministers and advisers; they are all aware that the world beyond their fiefdoms has changed in the last hundred years. And they are not interested in changing the almost medieval world they themselves inhabit.</p> </blockquote> <p>Thankfully this time the two men were <a href=\"http://www.dawn.com/2008/08/30/top4.htm\">alone</a> in their view and, nearly two months after the crime, the Pakistani parliament has announced a high-level police enquiry into the \"incident\".</p> <p>But I can't help wondering what would have happened if the Asian Human Rights Commission hadn't got hold of the story and launched an online campaign. Would this atrocity ever have been investigated? Or would these women's brutal murders simply have been ignored and passed over like so many thousands of others that have been commissioned in the name of honour?</p> <p>According to the UN, <a href=\"http://www.stophonourkillings.com/\">over 5000 women</a> and girls are killed every year for failing to live up to cultural and familial expectations of female behaviour, and some estimate that up to 25% of these murders happen in Pakistan. And it's not just women who are victims of the outdated patriarchal notions of ownership and control that lie behind these so-called <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/oct/29/nohonourinmurder\">honour killings</a>. In May for example, 22-year-old <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSDEL29449420080516\">Jasbir Singh</a> was murdered along with his partner Sunita Devi, this time in India, after her family found out that she was pregnant. The couple were living together at the time, but as they were both from the same village they were regarded by their caste as brother and sister and thus forbidden from entering into relations with one another. Their strangled bodies were later laid out for display outside Devi's parent's house, while villagers boasted of the pride they felt in maintaining the community's honour. The double murder \"was the act of real men\" according to one of Devi's cousins.</p> <p>But whatever the Balla villagers or Israr Ullah Zehri would have us believe, there is no cultural, religious or moral justification for these crimes: killing in the name of honour is quite simply an obscenity. Zehri thinks people should \"stop making such a fuss about it\". I think anyone with any sense of human decency should make as much fuss about it as they possibly can.</p>",
  "<p>You've heard the expression 'cool as a cucumber'? Even rusty academics have cemented it into British language \u2013 in dictionaries no less. The definition should say: 'Women who can wear Halston's over-the-knee Misa boots without resembling Julia Roberts circa Pretty Woman. Women with je ne sais quoi \u00e0 la pregnant Cate Blanchett and post-divorce Michelle Williams and, erm\u2026 Daisy Lowe.' </p> <p>Then there are the rest of us. Those with less cool than a tomato. Even on a 'fabulous' day. </p> <p>Somehow, I volunteered to sit beside a letterbox for 12 hours. The article would be called a day in the life of a post box, and I suppose the ridiculousness, and the delusion began there. So Big Boss sent me to the little red box in rural Somerset, driving (or should I say kangaroo-hopping) in a minty green Corsa. I am a serious hard-hitting journalist, I decided, not only with a company car but a shiny new expenses account. </p> <p>Never before have I filled a car with petrol, I realised as Corsa lurched into Texaco. Five minutes later, I had located the petrol hole. Twelve minutes later, the cap still covered it. Looking very businesslike in Nicki Hambleton-Jones mean specs and Ann Klein pencil skirt, I approach a leathery 4x4 driver on the neighbouring petrol pump.</p> <p>\"Erm, hello. Perhaps you could you help me.\"</p> <p>He looked up. Says nothing. </p> <p>\"- with the errr flap thingy, I can't quite open it.\"</p> <p>Damn it, what's it called. Leathery chap frowns slightly. So I say,</p> <p>\"On the car \u2013 the petrol flap.\"</p> <p>He understands. Obliges. Smiles. I glug in the petrol, inwardly proud, and decide he's not that bad looking for a forty-something. </p> <p>Hippy Traveller Friend sparked a relationship on the veg aisle in Somerfield. Well, sort of. After paying for her Munchies and pots of hummus and Lady Grey Twinings teabags at the same checkout for a few months \u2013 his checkout - they met in a party. They struck up a few words about the Matrix, I think. But he didn't ask her on a date until she popped back in to check out his checkout. Their first proper outing was a back-to-back X-Files session and five years on, she still goes to the same Somerfield. (Even though he's now a musician). </p> <p>Yes, sometimes cool is overrated, I decide. Leathery stands behind me in the shop queue and I imagine 4x4 drives through dusty Somerset villages on Sundays. Big Bald Shopman is saying something. I hand over my flashy new business expenses card. He says it again:</p> <p>\"Mileage.\"</p> <p>\"Erm, pardon?\"</p> <p>\"Mileage.\"</p> <p>He says it flat-pan. I wonder if mileage is a freebie or the Nectar Card of Texaco stations. They always mention in the Sainsburys queue, don't they? So I say,</p> <p>\"No thank you.\"</p> <p>He laughs, now. As does Acne Boy on the other till. </p> <p>\"No. I said mileage?\"</p> <p>It's a question now. He rises an octave at the end. So I say:</p> <p>\"I don't know, either.\"</p> <p>\"Where are you going?\"</p> <p>\"Somerset.\"</p> <p>\"On the M5?\"</p> <p>\"Oh no. I can only do A's, not M's.\"</p> <p>They are rocking about laughing now. They explain what mileage is and Leathery is breathing loud through his lips like he's impatient. My skirt feels a bit tight around my belly and the 'sultry' feels more like 'dumpy.' Then he speaks. (A bit Bristolian farmer for my liking). He says:</p> <p>\"You're not a natural are you?\"</p> <p>\"Haha, No. I'm most definitely a natural driver but this is my first time behind\u2026\"</p> <p>He cuts in. \"No, I meant natural blonde.\" And shakes his head a bit. </p> <p>Forget bumbling and the X-Files. There's something to be said for those glossy-haired women who don't spend their hours observing post boxes. Cool women who can carry off Halston Misa boots.

  "<p>There's a lot going on in Bristol's technology scene, and not least the work at <strong>Hewlett Packard</strong>'s impressive research department <strong><a href=\"http://www.hpl.hp.com/\">HP Labs</a></strong>, <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/technology/2007/08/30/nokia_music_library_comes_from_od2.html\">Nokia's <strong>OD2</strong></a> and a growing number of TV production companies. <strong>Ents24</strong> has grown to 16 staff since it founded in 1999 as a white-label event listings service.<br></p> <p>Backed by angel funding, the site relaunched in 2005 as a consumer-facing website <strong><a href=\"http://www.ents24.com\">Ents24.com</a></strong> and is hoping to squeeze a future out of ticket sales.</p> <p>Co-founder and managing director <strong>Neil Pollard</strong> introduces the site.</p> <p><br><strong>Neil Pollard</strong> and marketing executive <strong>Adele Taylor</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 Explain your business to my Mum.<br>\"Ents24 is a huge live entertainment guide covering live music, theatre, comedy, clubbing, cinema, festivals, exhibitions and lots of other attractions. From stand-up at the Stags Head to Madonna at the Millennium Stadium, we provide a central place where users can discover events, get all the information they need and book tickets.\"</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 How exactly does that work?<br>\"We add information about more than ten thousand shows every week, and our website provides lots of ways for people to quickly find the events they're interested in. You can browse what's on in your area, search for a specific artist or venue, or you can just leave all the hard work to us and sign up for email alerts. For example, if you tell us who your favourite bands are, we'll send you a message as soon as any of them announce new shows.\"</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 How do you make money?<br>\"For every event on Ents24.com, we provide an up-to-date link to where tickets are available to buy, so users don't have to spend ages looking around the web. If they buy a ticket, we generally receive a small finders fee from the ticket seller (at no extra cost to the user). Since so many people now use Ents24 as a starting point to plan their entertainment, it all adds up - last year we received commission on over half a million tickets. \"</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 What's your background?<br>\"Before Ents24, I was a postgrad student in the computer architecture group at Bristol University. I met the company's two other co-founders at university four years earlier.\"</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 How are personalisation and recommendation part of your business?<br>\"Personalisation is central to Ents24. By telling us their postcode and preferences, users can receive a fully customised newsletter into their inbox just in time for the weekend.

Having survived the down turn after the first dot com bubble burst, I can see that most companies have a real source of income this time around. However, I think there are still quite a few over-hyped websites around that don't seem to have any sustainable revenue plans.\"</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 What's your biggest challenge?<br>\"Margins on ticket sales are relatively low, so our biggest challenge is finding a cost effective marketing strategy. Instead of ploughing large amounts of money into driving traffic, we've invested heavily on making the web site as good as it can be, so our growth is largely dependent on users who like what they find at Ents24 spreading the word.\"<br></strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 Which tech businesses or web thinkers are the ones to watch?<br>\"Professor Wendy Hall at Southampton University is one of the UK's top web thinkers.

  "<p>Yasuo Fukuda's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/02/japan\">sudden resignation</a> as Japan's prime minister may have taken seasoned political commentators by surprise, but there was a <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/02/japan\"> certain inevitability</a> about the identity of the man tipped to succeed him.</p> <p>Though the selection process is notoriously opaque and fraught with factional manoeuvering, forces majeure notwithstanding, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/02/japan1\">Taro Aso</a> will become Japan's prime minister \u2013 at his fourth attempt \u2013 when the Liberal Democratic party (LDP) goes to the polls in three weeks' time.</p> <p>What follows is less certain. The opposition, having beaten Fukuda into submission after an 11-month tug-of-war in a deeply divided parliament, wants a general election to take place well ahead of the September 2009 deadline.</p> <p>And for good reason. Though it has governed Japan for all but 10 months of the past 53 years, most commentators agree that the LDP would emerge from a snap election as a mere shadow of its former self.</p> <p>Those who know Aso well expect him to bide his time, taking advantage of the boost in popularity that should accompany his ascension to the LDP's top job to push through a bill renewing Japan's <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/11/AR2008011103378.html\">controversial refuelling mission</a> in the Indian Ocean. Only then, one insider told me, will he call a general election:</p> <blockquote> <p>He has to call an election while he his still in his honeymoon period, and then say to the opposition: 'You may control the upper house, but now the momentum is with the LDP, so it's time you cut us a deal.'</p> </blockquote> <p>Aso's candidacy is not expected to go unopposed, however. Yuriko Koike, a former TV news anchorwoman who served as defence minister last year under Fukuda's predecessor, Shinzo Abe, has emerged as a <a href=\"http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jZnk2SkmOWM5MAeFKng4VYxZhn2Q\">possible challenger</a>.</p> <p>Several LDP heavyweights believe Koike offers the \"fresh face\" the party needs to retain its majority at the next election.</p> <p>But the 56-year-old Koike may prove too mercurial a figure for many in her party. She has switched her party allegiance several times since entering politics, and resigned as defence minister after less than two months in the job following a highly public falling-out with a senior civil servant.</p> <p>Junichiro Koizumi, who saved the LDP from electoral meltdown after becoming leader in 2001, has reportedly ruled himself out. The economics minister, <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24280182-25837,00.html\">Kaoru Yosano</a>, has been tipped as a possible contender, although the 70-year-old has now claimed that he had not given the premiership a moment's thought.</p> <p>Regardless of who succeeds Fukuda, Japan is now pondering the unthinkable: that the LDP, one of the most successful political machines of modern times, may be booted ignominiously into touch by a resurgent opposition and a disenchanted electorate.</p> <p>In his early days as LDP leader, Koizumi boasted that he would destroy the party in his quest for lasting political reform.</p> <p>Almost a decade on, Fukuda, the dour salaryman to Koizumi's maverick, may have just become the author of a very different LDP apocalypse.</p>",
  "<p>The first night of the Republican convention proper combined two themes in a way that the party has learned to master over the course of the last two presidential terms. On the one hand, non-partisanship, and on the other hand ... partisanship. During the first half of the evening, speeches about hurricane Gustav and the role of the US military backed up the convention's theme, \"Country First\". But as the night progressed, they intermingled more and more with critiques, implicit or explicit, of Barack Obama. There was a strikingly brief video address from George Bush - \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/03/uselections2008.republicans20086\">almost furtive</a>\", Martin Kettle calls it on theguardian.com today - in which the president praised John McCain and railed against the \"angry left\". And there were sharp attacks on Obama from the former presidential candidate Fred Thompson and the former Democrat Joe Lieberman, who became the first person to mention Obama's name at the podium, excoriating him for allegedly starving US troops of crucial resources even as he urged delegates, and the nation, to rise above partisan politics. (Lines to please the socially conservative wing of the party were much in evidence, too: a reference to McCain's pro-life position won the biggest cheer of the night.)</p> <p>The day's other dominant stories, of course, concerned Sarah Palin, including an ongoing row about her alleged membership in a fringe Alaskan secessionist party. But the party is rallying strongly behind her: Thompson used his speech to attack the media for obsessing over the story, and every mention of her name drew huge applause. Palin fans - and there are many among the delegates - speak of her as a bracingly conservative breath of fresh air. Critics might suspect that rationalisation is at play here: after all, don't loyal Republicans have a compelling interest in convincing themselves that McCain hasn't made a disastrous error? Either way, nobody should underestimate the strength of feeling in St Paul in support of the Alaska governor. She is the convention's keynote speaker today; that speech will surely prove to be a decisive moment in the election campaign.</p> <h2>Today at the convention</h2> <p>Here's a prediction: with a vastly supportive audience, as a naturally good speaker, and with expert speechwriting assistance, Sarah Palin will give a speech tonight that will be received with adulation inside the convention hall, and praise in the US media outside it. She'll be in a stronger position as a result, though admittedly that might not be saying much. The full details of the rest of today's programme have yet to be announced.</p> <h2>On theguardian.com</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/03/uselections2008.republicans20085\">Convention gets off the ground with addresses from Thompson, Lieberman and Bush</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/cartoon/2008/sep/02/sarah.palin.us.elections\">Cartoon: Steve Bell on Palin's winning mix of guns, babies and Jesus</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/03/uselections2008.republicans20082\">My fellow Alaskans: independent views hit McCain's running mate</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2008/sep/03/republicans2008.fredthompson\">Michael Tomasky: Where are the GOP's stars?</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/oliverburkemanblog/2008/sep/03/uselections2008.johnmccain1\">Campaign diary: Nasty liberal interviewer unfairly terrifies well-meaning McCain campaign aide</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/03/uselections2008.republicans2008\">Low-fat Huckabee puts yoghurt and jogging on the GOP menu</a></p> <h2>Best of the rest</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tag/sarah-palin\">The Huffington Post: Sarah Palin's first five days</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/02/AR2008090203462.html?hpid=topnews\">Washington Post: Aides Say Team Interviewed Palin Late in the Process</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article_email/SB122039868736392867-lMyQjAxMDI4MjAwMjMwOTI4Wj.html\">WSJ: GOP Tightens Image Control As Palin Prepares for Debut</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0908/13101.html\">Politico: Palin reignites culture wars</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/212652.php\">Talking Points Memo: Why did Fred Thompson accuse Barack Obama of not opposing infanticide?</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/02/obama-to-appear-on-fox-on-thursday-night/\">NYT blog: Obama to Appear on Fox on Thursday Night</a></p> <h2>Latest polls</h2> <p>Obama emerges with a clear lead in both daily tracking polls - which are more responsive to events, but less reliable as polls - and in regular polls.

Paul's supporters may not have succeeded in getting their libertarian hero nominated as the Republican candidate, but their enthusiasm seemed undiminished.

  "<p>\"I'm not going to the toilet for the whole week.\" Those were the first words my travel companion, Andrew, uttered as we arrived at Pollywogg Holler Eco Resort in western New York state. That was after he saw the al-fresco compostable toilet. I assured him it was constructed using the highly regarded Clivus Multrum system and perfectly clean, but he was having none of it. He also refused to use the \"rustic\" shower shack, preferring to fester instead. There seemed to be a contradiction here regarding cleanliness, I pointed out. He thought not.</p> <p>Pollywogg Holler, named after the frogs, and their chorus, that fill the woods of the Phillips Creek forest in Allegany county, is a unique place.

I fitted into the former category, no need to tell you where my friend's opinion lay.</p> <p>We arrived at dusk, after a drive from New York City through nearly 300 miles of continuous forest, past the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catskill_Mountains\"> Catskill Mountains</a>, past the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger_Lakes\">Finger Lakes</a> and skirting the Delaware river at the point it chooses to sparkle at its most glorious. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337222023\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2008/09/02/pollyhut.jpg\" alt=\"Pine Knot at Pollywogg Holler \" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pine Knot at Pollywogg Holler </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Vincent</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Built over the past 30 years by owners Bill and Barbara Castle, Pollywogg Holler is a diamond in the rough. Hidden down a mud and gravel logging road, it started off as one man's folly, and has evolved into something Bilbo Baggins would consider a home away from home. There are leats, streams, beaver dams, wooden houses built around trees and higgledy-piggledy cabins and shacks. A staircase made from branches wraps around the outside of one house that leans at a rather precarious angle. A well, covered over with a two-tier thatch canopy, nestles next to another. Rams heads, stained glass and a carved wooden door embellish yet another.</p> <p>The catalyst for this magic in the woods was a near tragedy. \"When I was 40, I died and the paramedics managed to bring me back to life,\" Bill told me about 20 seconds after meeting us on the road and loading us aboard his electric golf cart. \"It really did change my life. I decided to go to art school, built this place and lived here. My sister stopped talking to me. She said we were 'living in the forest like animals.' She's come round since.\" </p> <p>Bill, who looks like a hippie Walt Whitman, took us on a helter-skelter ride through the forest. We whizzed over streams, across bridges and under huge oaks and pines. Ten-foot high glass sculptures, life-size orange dinosaurs and enormous paintings casually propped against trees peeked out at us through the dense forest. \"I treat the woods as an outdoor gallery,\" said Bill. \"All the artworks have been given to us by the students doing the prestigious art course at nearby Alfred College. Each year we get more.\" There are also quite a few of Bill's own works in metal and wood.</p> <p>Finally, we approached Pollywogg proper and had to hold on to the cart and our bags as we crossed one last rickety wooden bridge that seemed to be defying the law of gravity. </p> <p>We stayed in the Main Lodge, the epicentre of this little community. A wonderful log cabin made of large red pine logs and maple roofing, it is all held together with ash dowels. No nails here. The porch cantilevers out over the brook and the dammed pond below. Inside are two small bedrooms and a large kitchen and living room. An enormous wagon-wheel kerosene chandelier hangs in the centre. Adirondack-style furniture, which uses fallen branches rather than commercial timber, is everywhere. Old musical instruments hang from the walls. Impromptu jam sessions are common.</p> <p>Bill built the lodge over every weekend for three years. It then became their main home, even though it had no mains water, electricity or central heating (it gets down to -27\u00b0F in winter). Instead, they used a potbellied stove, pumped spring water and summoned up lots of grit. The Castles now live in a ranch house across the forest road with all the mod cons. But most nights, if they are empty, Bill can be found sleeping in one of the loft houses or the Great Camp-style lean-tos.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337222024\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Travel/Pix/pictures/2008/09/02/pollywoggdome220.jpg\" alt=\"Phantasy dome at Pollywogg Holler \" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Phantasy dome </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Vincent</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He can take his pick from the Sauna Loft, which has a pine-fired Finnish sauna that also heats the sleeping loft above; the Wood Loft, reached by the outdoor organic staircase; the Love Shack, which frankly needs a bit more TLC; the Pine Knot and Lily Pad - two open-fronted lean-tos perched on the edge of spring-fed ponds; or the Phantasy Dome, a futuristic geodesic structure, with a circular bed suspended from the ceiling.</p> <p>That first night, we rested on the porch listening to the frog chorus, the inky darkness intermittently lit up by thousands of fireflies hovering below the forest canopy.

  "<p>PSP transfer? HD? Power usage? Availability in Norway and France? Storage requirements? Sony have answered your questions about <a href=\"http://uk.playstation.com/ps3/hardware/accessories/detail/item102429/PlayTV/\">PlayTV</a>, their forthcoming Freeview recorder for the PS3. Read on for full details...</p> <p><strong>What was the thinking behind PlayTV? Won't PS3 owners - generally tech loving early adopters - already have Sky+/Freeview PVR?</strong><br>PlayTV and the firmware upgrade of 2.42 provide the PS3 owner a single machine that can switch between game play and TV using the slick interface to watch and record free to air TV, in their house or while travelling with the PSP using Remote Play.</p> <p><strong>Will a UK PlayTV work with a US PS3?</strong><br>PlayTV does not work with US PS3.</p> <p><strong>What's the future plans for PlayTV - will new hardware be required for HD if/when Freeview HD comes on board?</strong><br>All manufacturers have to upgrade their hardware as the new standard has only just been defined. Currently no commercially available DVB-T2 exists. Sony is currently evaluating this new standard.</p> <p><strong>Can you store the recorded TV on an external hard disk? (and if not how many hours of video can you record on the various PS3 models)</strong><br>PlayTV allows you to move the content to the XMB where you can manage this in the same way you do with all of your media on the PS3. All broadcasts vary depending on how the information is encoded and sent out over the airwaves, we use the average of 1hr = 1GB, when you are using PlayTV there is a recording size in the library, you will soon see if your favourite programmes are taking up more or less space than the guidelines.</p> <p><strong>Can you clear up the transfer to PSP - is it a feature that's present now, or one that's going to be added in the future?</strong><br>PlayTV doesn't support direct PSP transfers but you can enjoy live or recorded video content via Remote Play feature.. PlayTV allows you to move the content to the XMB where you can manage this in the same way you do with all of your media on the PS3</p> <p>We understand that it may be possible for people who are very technically savvy to convert files moved over to the XMB, however, PlayTV was not created with this purpose in mind and it's not something we encourage.</p> <p><strong>What's the effect on the PS3 in terms of stability when recording while playing a game that takes data from the hard drive - is there any evidence of performance drops in gaming while recording?</strong><br>We have tested all PS3 and many Playstation games released as of today and have not noticed any significant issues during recording. PlayTV was designed to ensure that game play would always take priority as the Playstation 3' is first and foremost a games machine.</p> <p><strong>What plans are there for upgrades/updates in the future (in general)?</strong><br>SCEE is evaluating future plans.</p> <p><strong>Are there any plans to release alternative models to allow recording of FreeSat / Cable / Sky channels?</strong><br>SCEE is evaluating future plans .</p> <p><strong>Is HD recording still going to be coming to the current model? Are Sony looking at updating PlayTV's capabilities regularly via update?</strong><br>SCEE is evaluating future plans.</p> <p><strong>Toshiba are releasing TVs this winter which use a pared-down Cell to upscale SD. Will there be upscaling of Freeview live/recorded TV in the way there is for DVDs?</strong><br>Currently the picture on all TV types for PlayTV is of a high standard, in the market there are many variations of the upscale options available, Playtv does rudimentary upscaling of the picture already. The UI is also fully scalable between SD and HD pictures.</p> <p><strong>Why can't you record 2 things at once? PlayTV has 2 tuners, so it should be possible.</strong><br>We dedicated one tuner to do the recording and one to do the watching. Our find and record feature will find all of your programmes and this paired with a clever conflict management system should ensure that you can always record what you want.</p> <p><strong>What's the release date for the Irish version?</strong><br>DVB-T has not been rolled out in Ireland. Once digital rollout has been completed. SCEE will investigate further.</p> <p><strong>If you're going away for a week or so and want to record something, do you need to have the PS3 on all the time or can you put it on some sort of standby mode so it'll wake up when it needs to record?</strong><br>The PS3 only needs to be left in standby mode. It will wake up, record and shut itself down when the recording is completed.</p> <p><strong>Does it do series record?</strong><br>PlayTV fully supports a daily and weekly repeat option. Allowing you to set recordings for any programme at any time and create repeats for up to 25 times.</p> <p><strong>If files cannot be moved to personal storage or the PSP why not? What is the difference to a DVD recorder where you can record as much broadcast TV as you want and store it on Disc?</strong><br>PlayTV doesn't support direct PSP transfers but you can enjoy live or recorded video content via Remote Play feature.. PlayTV allows you to move the content to the XMB where you can manage this in the same way you do with all of your media on the PS3.</p> <p>We understand that it may be possible for people who are very technically savvy to convert files moved over to the XMB, however, PlayTV was not created with this purpose in mind and it's not something we encourage.</p> <p><strong>When the unit comes to Europe, will it work with Norwegian terrestrial TV?</strong><br>Currently, SCEE has no plans to launch in Norway.</p> <p><strong>Will it work with French digital signals?</strong><br>Yes</p> <p><strong>Will it only work with free to air channels, or can I also pick up encrypted channels such as Canal+?</strong><br>Only Free to Air Channels are supported by PlayTV.</p> <p><strong>Any plans for Home integration (such as inviting people into the virtual flat to watch programmes stored on the hard drive and so on)?</strong><br>SCEE currently doesn't have any plans to integrate PlayTV into Home.</p> <p><strong>Does the BluRay remote work with it?</strong><br>Yes and we have developed a guide for you to use which is accessible from the main menu. A hard back sticker is also supplied for use with the BD remote control.</p> <p><strong>Does red button stuff still work?</strong><br>Yes you can use the red button of BluRay remote or if you press L3 on the Sixaxis you will get an on screen keypad where you will be able to use the interactive services.</p> <p><strong>Will PlayTV will be able to receive the new Freeview HD format ?</strong><br>Refer to Q above</p> <p><strong>Why did Sony make one solution remotes, even their own redundant with the ps3. Surely if they believed that their console would be the centre of family entertainment system they, would have put in IR control, as in all stand alone Sony blue ray players. When will the come up with a solution to allow me to use my Harmony remote control with the ps3?</strong><br>The PS3 is designed as a gaming machine and controllers and remotes have been designed to be Bluetooth compatible, when using PlayTV you will only need to turn the TV on, set your TV to the desired volume and the use PlayTV and the PS3 for all your entertainment needs.</p> <p><strong>I'm happy for my ps3 to be on when needed but not all day. What I'm hoping for is a function which will turn the ps3 off after a few hours of being idled by the user. Does this function exist?</strong><br>The PS3 will wake up from its lowest power consumption position of standby to make the recording and then shut back down to standby on completion of the recording.</p> <p><strong>I like to turn my PS3 off at the plug on the back, rather than leave it on all day while I'm at work. I've understood that even on stand-by the PS3 uses a fair amount electricity. If you have the Play TV, it's more than likely to be left on all the time or standby. So will it be encouraging the use of more electricity?</strong><br>The PS3 has been designed to use the least amount of power possible in standby mode.</p> <p>PlayTV is released on the 19th Sept. It costs 70 UKP.</p>",

Photograph: Fraser Lewry</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fraser Lewry/Flickr</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I like food writers whose personalities really come across in their writing. Hugh Fearnley Whittingstall's mighty <em>Fish</em> opus is such an obvious labour of love it's quite possible to believe that the tassel-haired colossus could tell you the page number of every recipe featured in the book, as well as the grade of paper used during manufacture. At the other end of the scale, Jamie Oliver's titles read as if they've been franchised out for production to some kind of culinary clearing house. I'd be surprised if he's even <em>read</em> the books released under his name. There's no doubt the boy can cook, but his literary output remains bland and unconvincing.</p> <p>The man whose personality looms largest in his writing is American chef <a href=\"http://www.anthonybourdain.co.uk/\">Anthony Bourdain</a>, a New York loudmouth whose background is resolutely obvious from his in-your-face prose. In <em>Le Halles Cookbook</em> he placates anyone concerned about tossing live lobsters into boiling water with the phrase, <em>\"Don't worry. Lobsters are essentially big fucking bugs too stupid to know they're dead\"</em>, and instructs the reader to <em>\"pick up your wooden spoon and scrape, you magnificent bastard!\"</em> during another recipe. </p> <p>Where Bourdain troubles me is that he appears to lend his name to almost anything: the dust-jacket of Gina DePalma's magnificent <em>Dolce Italiano</em> comes with a lengthy quote from Bourdain. So does Mario Batali's <em>Molto Italiano</em>. And Michael Ruhlman &amp; Brian Polcyn's <em>Charchuterie</em>. And Jerry Hopkins' <em>Extreme Cuisine</em>. There's literally no stopping the man.</p> <p>He's not one for understatement, either. On the back of <em>Nose to Tail Eating</em>, the wonderful Fergus Henderson book of recipes from <a href=\"http://www.stjohnrestaurant.co.uk/\">St. John</a> in London, he's at it again, claiming the title to be <em>\"a cult classic from my favourite chef and favourite restaurant in the world\"</em>. See what I mean?</p> <p>Having said that, Bourdain could well be right about St John, and if the restaurant really is the best in the world, and if Henderson really is as good as our friend claims, then there's surely no better way to celebrate the arrival of 'V' in the alphabet than to reproduce the restaurant's signature dish, roast veal marrowbones. </p> <p>You may need a hacksaw. I did.</p> <p><strong> Recipe: serves four</strong></p> <p>12 pieces of middle veal marrowbone, each 7-8cm in length <br>Bunch of flat-leaf parsley<br>2 shallots, peeled and sliced thinly<br>Small handful of capers<br>Juice of one lemon<br>Extra-virgin olive oil<br>Salt and pepper to season<br>Good quality sea salt <br>Good quality white bread for toasting</p> <p>1) Pre-heat the oven to 200\u00b0c.</p> <p>2) Place the bones upright in a roasting dish and cook for 20 minutes. The marrow should be bubbling nicely by the end, but not so runny that it melts away.</p> <p>3) While the bones are cooking, roughly chop the parsley (Henderson refers to this process as 'disciplining' the herb - see what I mean about personality?), mix it with the chopped shallots, then, at the last moment, dress with the juice and oil, and season with a pinch of salt and a twist of pepper. </p> <p>4) Toast the bread.</p> <p>5) Serve. Put three of the bones on each plate, add a couple of slices of toast, and finish with a small amount of the salad and a miniature sea-salt mountain.</p> <p>Just to prove the Bourdain isn't the only one who's a slave to hyperbole, I'd like to say that the results are <em>wondrous</em>. Everything about this dish screams excess, from the bones standing tall and brown and proud, to the oozing, unctuous, messy marrow. Flying solo, the flavours are good, but together they're nothing short of spectacular, a salty, nectarous riot of almost miraculous symmetry.</p> <p>If anyone needs a quote for their dust-jacket, you know where I am.</p>",
  "<p>As the Mill discovered one dark winter's morning when it flicked through Heating and Ventilating News and came across <strong>Hot Air! \u2013 A Sideways Glance At The World Of Central Heating Gossip</strong>, it's a nasty feeling when someone nicks your riff and then does a better job of it.

  "<p>A policeman's lot is not a happy one, particularly if you're Sir Ian Blair. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/01/race.equality\">Tarique Ghaffur</a> racial discrimination case has come at the worst possible time for the beleaguered Met commissioner, coming as it has done hard on the heels of so many personal attacks about his style of leadership. However, the real damage to Blair may not be so much in the case itself but in the ammunition it provides to his many enemies at City Hall and in the media.</p> <p>Last month leaked emails from Boris Johnson's aides demanded to know why the mayor could not remove Sir Ian Blair from his post while an investigation is under way into how \u00a33m worth of contracts were awarded to his skiing companion <a href=\"http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-23523688-details/Leaked+emails+reveal+'plot'+by+Boris+Johnson+aide+to+sack+Met+chief+Sir+Ian+Blair/article.do\">Andy Miller</a>. If Ghaffur's current claims that he was ordered by the Met commissioner to <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/7591133.stm\">rewrite</a> a report on why a black man, Delroy Lindo, was stopped so often but never convicted are true, it could be what the mayor's aides have been quietly praying for. </p> <p>In the case of the ongoing investigation into the Miller contracts, Kit Malthouse, London's Conservative deputy mayor for policing, was told Johnson did not have the power to suspend Blair and that \"if the nuclear button is pressed\", it could put the inquiry in jeopardy. However, the spectacle of many of the most senior officers currently serving in the Met being hauled before an extremely divisive employment tribunal next year could well tip Malthouse into taking that option. In all probability emails are at this very moment flying around City Hall re-examining legal options or at the very least a private line of communication has likely been opened up with Blair asking if he is looking for an honourable way out of the crisis.</p> <p>All of which is a great shame, as Blair has, in his own waym been a brave advocate of tackling the increase in black youth crime in the capital and at the same time racial discrimination in the Met, a difficult balancing act. Witness him putting the full weight of his office behind the findings from the Damilola Taylor and Stephen Lawrence inquiries. But in doing so he has failed to heed Oscar Wilde's famous maxim that \"a man cannot be too careful in his choice of enemies\". </p> <p>Take the furore caused by his 2006 remarks about the murders of Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman and whether or not the media would have reported the crime in the same way if the girls had been black. He <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1508942/Met-chief-Why-the-fuss-over-Soham-murders.html\">said</a> \"We do devote the same level of resources to murders in relation to their difficulty. The difference is how these are reported. I believe that the media are guilty of institutional racism in the way they report deaths.\" Although Blair could have chosen his words more carefully, does it really seem likely that a man who in public is so outspoken against racism would in private use his authority to rewrite a racially-sensitive report? Yet by tarring all news outlets with the same brush, his own force had been subjected to by the Stephen Lawrence inquiry, Blair guaranteed that in future the media would line up behind his political enemies.</p> <p>Frankly his position was not helped either by allowing his deputy commissioner, Sir Paul Stephenson, to brief the press and him saying that Mr Ghaffur should <a href=\"http://www.thelondonpaper.com/cs/Satellite/london/news/article/1157154840177?packedargs=aid%3D1157154840177%26suffix%3DArticleController\">\"shut up\" and get on with his job</a>.Whatever senior officers may feel in private about Ghaffurs case, letting vent to their anger in public simply gave the story more oxygen and so played further into the hands of those who want to see the head of the Met step down before his time. </p> <p>Sir Ian so far has said little in public about the case other than he has a \"long, honourable and occasionally blood-stained record on the championing of diversity\". Ironically he therefore finds himself in a very similar position to that of the prime minister, seemingly criticised on all sides with ever fewer colleagues he can rely on to say the right thing and increasingly at the mercy of events that seem beyond his control. No doubt like Brown he will be reflecting that it is lonely at the top. <br></p>",

But since then each day has brought fresh details of her life and politics, supporting the view that McCain made an impulsive choice and his campaign team either failed to thoroughly vet her or did not have enough time to do so.</p> <p>The revelation that Palin appeared to support the secessionist Alaskan Independence party (AIP) - whose motto is \"Alaska First\" - sits awkwardly with McCain's campaign slogan, \"Country First\", and will be controversial in a country whose oath of allegiance includes the phrase \"one nation, indivisible\".</p> <p>It emerged Palin tried to ban certain books from a public library, an awkward disclosure in a country that enshrines free speech in the first amendment to its constitution.</p>  The AIP believes the 1958 vote that led to Alaska joining the American union was corrupt. It wants a rerun, with the aim of eventual independence. Party officials said yesterday Palin had attended at least one convention before leaving in 1996 to join the Republicans. But the party's chairwoman, Lynette Clarke, said today she had been mistaken when she claimed Palin had been an AIP member. The McCain camp yesterday insisted she had been a registered Republican since 1982. <p>A video of Palin's address this year to the independence party's convention while Alaska's Republican governor surfaced yesterday on YouTube. A smiling and gracious Palin wished the delegates a successful meeting, ending with the words \"God bless you.\"</p> <p>The first story to raise doubts about Palin was over a state probe into allegations that she abused her position as governor to try to sack her brother-in-law, a state trooper, after he divorced her sister. The same day the McCain campaign team put out a statement saying that Palin's 17-year-old daughter, Bristol, was five months pregnant. The father was later named in media reports as Levi Johnston, 18. The campaign team said it had gone public to end rumours that Palin's most recent child was in fact Bristol's.</p> <p>In a MySpace entry, which has now been blocked, Johnston describes himself a \"fuckin' redneck\" and says he is in a relationship but \"doesn't want kids\". He has left Alaska to join Palin's family at the Republican party conference in St Paul, Minnesota, where she is due to make a speech tonight.</p> <p>It emerged that Palin's husband, Todd, who is of Inuit descent and prides himself on being a champion snowmobile racer, was arrested 20 years ago for suspected drink-driving.</p> <p>Journalists descended on Alaska on Saturday and uncovered further details. According to Time magazine, as mayor of the small town of St George, Palin tried to ban certain books from a local library and threatened to sack a librarian who opposed this.</p> <p>And, contrary to Palin's claim that she had opposed the Bridge to Nowhere, the Alaskan bridge that cost millions but only links to a small community and is cited by McCain as a symbol of wastefulness, it was revealed she had initially supported it.</p> <p>Yesterday, the Washington Post reported that far from being a cost-cutter, she hired a lobbyist while mayor of her hometown, Wasilla, to secure $27m funding for a population of 9,000, the kind of spending McCain has vowed to veto.</p> <p>The paper later reported that Palin had a stake in an ailing car washing business that she failed to fully declare as governor. </p> <p>Just as McCain aides were beginning to hope the worst was over, an interview surfaced from earlier this year in which Palin was heard laughing after a talk show host referred to one of her Republican colleagues as a \"bitch\" and \"cancer\" in the state of Alaska.</p> <p>McCain, in Philadelphia yesterday, insisted \"the vetting was thorough\".<br>Republican aides were adamant that all the details that emerged had been known to them. Tucker Eskew, an adviser to Palin, gave the impression the disclosures were a deliberate strategy. \"We are going to flush the toilet,\" he said. But there was plenty of evidence to suggest it was not deliberate and instead reflected a failure on the part of McCain's campaign to interview her at length.</p> <p>A team of 10 staffers were dispatched to Alaska on Thursday, but Nicole Wallace, a spokeswoman for McCain, insisted they had been sent not to conduct a more thorough vetting but simply to help with the sudden influx of reporters.</p> <p>McCain may have chosen Palin, whom he had only met twice, because he wanted a woman on his ticket rather than two elderly men, as would have been the case if he had chosen Joe Lieberman. There are reports McCain had planned to pick Lieberman but would have had a hard time persuading the convention given Lieberman's pro-choice stance on abortion.</p> <p>Palin, 44, is popular with convention delegates. She has the support of the convention. Christian evangelicals, the gun lobby and anti-abortionists have swung behind her.</p> <p>A member of the Texas delegation, Christopher Harvey, 28, said: \"As a Texan we believe in gun rights, the Bible, and against abortion and against gay marriage. The things we believe in, she believes in.\"</p> <p>Views such as this almost guarantee her a standing ovation when she delivers a prime-time speech at the convention in St Paul, Minnesota. Rick Davis, a senior McCain adviser, said her speech would provide her with a chance \"to tell her story\".</p>",
  "<p>A man with a history of mental illness was in police custody today after going on a two-hour shooting spree in Washington state that left six people dead, including a deputy sheriff. Two people were injured. </p> <p>The gunman, who gave himself up after a high-speed car chase, was identified by officials as Isaac Zamora, 28, from Alger, a small town 75 miles north of Seattle. He had recently served a six-month sentence for drug possession and was under community supervision.</p> <p>Deputy sheriff Anne Jackson, 40, went to investigate a reported shooting in rural Skagit county in the early afternoon on Tuesday. She did not return or respond to radio calls. Her body was found next to another victim and there were three more bodies nearby. Two of the dead were construction workers.</p> <p>Police tracked the man's car as he raced down the busy interstate 5 highway at more than 95mph. A motorist was found shot dead on the highway, a motorcyclist was shot in the arm at a Shell petrol station and a state trooper was hit in the arm during the chase.</p> <p>The pursuit ended when the gunman pulled into a police station in Mount Vernon and surrendered.</p> <p>Washington's governor, Chris Gregoire, called for an independent third-party review and a prosecutor to be appointed by the Washington Association of Prosecuting Attorneys.</p> <p>\"I will be directing them to look into how this case was handled and provide an initial report to me within 10 days,\" Gregoire said.</p> <p>Zamora's mother said later she had tried repeatedly to get help for her son, whom she described as \"desperately mentally ill\".</p> <p>\"We're so devastated for the families,\" Dennise Zamora told Associated Press. \"I wish it would have been him or me that was killed. That's how deeply I feel about it.\"</p> <p>Dennise Zamora said Jackson, the sheriff among the first victims, had tried to help the family in the past. \"She was very gracious. She knew exactly what we were going through.\"</p>",

The Tyndall Centre on Climate Change Research says that the UK will need to hit absolute emissions reductions of between 6% to 9% annually, if we are to play our part in a realistic global climate deal. </p> <p>Tesco should adopt this target for its own business, including fuel for its vehicles, the emissions that stem from all the stores supporting logistics and, vitally, emissions from the transport its customers use to shop at Tesco's out of town stores. Tesco's biggest weakness is its basic business model that largely depends on customers' use of private cars. </p> <p>Their future growth model is based on ever more giant out-of-town hypermarkets feeding sprawling suburbs \u2013 copying a Wal-Mart style approach that in the US has created what are called \"dead zones\". This is the kind of locked-in fossil-fuel dependence that needs breaking. Even if Tesco do end up halving their energy use per square foot, City analysts suggest that they have the assets to double their shop floor space in the UK.</p> <p>Tesco also make a big deal of cutting plastic bag use, but their marginal achievements are ridiculed, somewhat, by the city of New Delhi and the country of Bangladesh, where plastic bags have been phased out completely. Why can't Tesco do the same?</p> <p>There is something which might be an acid test of Tesco's commitment to sustainability. Environmentally speaking, in the UK we live beyond our means, consuming at a level that would require at least three planets to sustain.</p> <p>Consuming less is as important as consuming differently. <a href=\"http://www.wrap.org.uk/\">Wrap</a>, the government-sponsored agency whose aim is to cut the waste of resources, estimates that we end up throwing away one bag in three of all the food we buy. </p> <p>Instead of cajoling us to over-consume with buy-one-get-one-free offers, Tesco should have notices at check-outs suggesting that customers think really hard about what's in their trolleys, and to put one third back on the shelves.</p> <p>It's easy for a company to create the impression of being green. All it has to do is have some green initiatives. But it's almost impossible for the general public to tell whether the action is remotely adequate or sufficient. These few little benchmarks might reveal the depth and colour of their commitment. </p> <p>\u00b7 Andrew Simms is policy director of the <a href=\"http://www.neweconomics.org/gen/\">new economics foundation</a> and author of Tescopoly: How One shop Came Out on Top and Why it Matters</p> <p>\u00b7 Post your comment on this article below</p>",
  "<p>Mrs KE to Dr Marie Stopes, 1923: </p> <blockquote> <p>Please could you give me some advice about preventing my self from becoming pregnant again, I had my first child in 1910 ... managed to rear Him. then 1 year after I was pregnant again and suffered terribly ... after that one was born could not sit down properly for 7 years, and was doctoring all the time ... at last I went to Hospital ... operation ... and they said I must on no condition have any more children but did not tell me what to do and the consequences was I got pregnant again ... awful time and the baby had to be removed last March to save my life it lived 7 weeks and died an awful death ... We tried for it not to happen again but I am now 3 months and having an awful time, always in pain ...</p> </blockquote> <p>Mrs KE asked for an abortion. My mother, Marie Stopes, wrote a sympathetic note to her in addition to a standard reply, but said she could not help.</p> <p>I think those, such as Ann Farmer, who have objected to the use of <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2602221/New-stamps-mark-women-of-distinction-Marie-Stopes.html\">my mother's image</a> on Royal Mail stamps \u2013 because, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2008/08/27/nosplit/dt2701.xml#head7\">in Farmer's words</a>, she \"was a notorious eugenicist and an antisemite who advocated the sterilisation of poor women to promote the welfare of 'the race'\" \u2013 are out of touch with the realities of the 1920s: on the one hand, the condition of women like Mrs KE; on the other, the responses to her condition of those more fortunate than her.</p> <p>Many people supported my mother's efforts to get help to women in agony, like Mrs KE, and also my mother's efforts to enlighten women about the possibilities of <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=M13Q0aymFJoC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=Marie+Stopes&amp;sig=ACfU3U24kMNSuCSmz3jgrtAFZccyL314zw\">married love</a>. While many condemned as obscene the idea of women enjoying sex in marriage, many recognised that her maxim \"Every baby a wanted baby\" was obviously right. Many also recognised the converse: that babies born to suffer throughout life might be better off not having been born.</p> <p>Inspired by what my mother achieved, the modern charity which bears her name, <a href=\"http://www.mariestopes.org.uk/\">Marie Stopes International</a>, works tirelessly to provide women and men with the right to control their fertility and exercise choice in the number, spacing and timing of their families. Today, her legacy extends across 40 countries worldwide, and the modern organisation provides services to more than 5 million people every year, irrespective of their race, creed, class, economic status or colour.</p> <p>In the 1920s, many drew the conclusion that those who cared should take active steps to make the world a better place, and eugenics had been very widely accepted as responsible action from the late 19th century. But it was, of course, discredited by Hitler's evil. If one enters upon historical criticism, however, one should understand the historical context.</p> <p>It was obviously right to put birth control facilities in reach of the poor, as they were the ones in most need. The letter I have quoted is but one from the very many thousands my mother received. Ann Farmer should read <a href=\"http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1082491\">Dear Dr Stopes \u2013 Sex in the 1920s</a>, edited by Ruth Hall.</p> <p>Finally, I find Farmer's conclusion that \"the majority of feminists ... feared that birth control would undermine women's right to refuse unwanted sexual relationships\" a surprisingly negative view on marriage, and equally negative view on women's rights.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Has any film had stand-ins for a dead actor as famous as Johnny Depp, Colin Farrell and Jude Law for Heath Ledger in Terry Gilliam's The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus? </strong><br>Mark Robertson, Lewisham</p> <p>In a word, no. Leo McCarey borrowed footage from Alfred Hitchcock's Strangers on a Train to complete Robert Walker's performance in My Son John (1952) and Douglas Trumbull utilised unused scenes and a stand-in to finish Brainstorm (1983) after Natalie Wood drowned. More recently, CGI was employed to disguise the demise of John Candy in Wagons East (1994) and Oliver Reed in Gladiator (2000). But film-makers usually seek to mask a star's absence by using anonymous body doubles, who are shot from oblique angles to hide their more obvious dissimilarities.</p> <p>Since Mary Dees and Paula Winslowe teamed to duplicate Jean Harlow's physical and vocal presence in Jack Conway's Saratoga (1937), several high-profile pictures have resorted to such tactics, including The Misfits (1961, Clark Gable), Game of Death (Bruce Lee, 1978), Poltergeist III (Heather O'Rourke, 1988) and The Crow (Brandon Lee, 1994). Similarly, Nick Adams dubbed some of James Dean's dialogue in Giant (1956), while Jane Withers completed Mary Wickes's voicing of Laverne the gargoyle in Disney's The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337167725\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/09/01/plan9.jpg\" alt=\"Plan 9 from Outer Space\" width=\"220\" height=\"110\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Isn't that your chiropractor? ...

An attempt to record the action using the Kinoscope process was abandoned after two episodes, but the show so unnerved armchair viewers that Hammer snapped up the rights and retitled the property The Quatermass Xperiment to emphasise its X-rated content. Nigel Kneale, who had scripted the six-part original, was unhappy with the performance of fading American star Brian Donlevy in the role created by Reginald Tate, Professor Bernard Quatermass: \"He took very little interest in the making of the film or in playing the part. It was a case of take the money and run. Or in the case of Mr Donlevy, waddle.\" </p> <p><strong>I was ankle deep in popcorn on my last visit to the local multiplex.

It recently emerged that UK cinema tickets would cost an extra \u00a331.30 without the popcorn subsidy. So maybe you should be grateful to David B Wallerstein, who, in 1928, talked the management of the Chicago Theater into offering popcorn to its patrons. During the silent era, audiences paid such close attention to the action and captions that they didn't need the distraction of confectionery. But Wallerstein reasoned that viewers could listen to the new-fangled spoken dialogue while also tucking into buttered popcorn. Hence director King Vidor opining, \"Popcorn and necking only came into pictures with the talkies.\"</p> <p>Joining the Balaban &amp; Katz Corporation from the Harvard Business School in 1926, Wallerstein established himself as a pioneering exhibitor. He introduced live entertainment between films and Judy Garland, Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra and Mary Martin all sang at his venues. He retired as president of B&amp;K in 1965, but not before he had persuaded ABC to help his friend Walt Disney finance Disneyland. But, as Morgan Spurlock would confirm, Wallerstein's lasting legacy is the fast food concept of supersizing. Realising that people felt greedy returning for second helpings of popcorn, toffee apples and iced drinks, but needing to increase his concession takings, Wallerstein abandoned two-for-one offers in favour of the kingsize portion. Furthermore, he persuaded founder Ray Kroc to adopt the idea on joining the board of McDonald's in 1968.</p> <p>Do you have a question? Email ask.parky@guardian.co.uk</p>",
  "<p>Billboard ads for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/angelinajolie\">Angelina Jolie</a> film Wanted have been banned by the Advertising Standards Authority for glamorising gun violence.</p> <p>The posters for the Hollywood movie featured Jolie and her co-star James McAvoy holding guns in a variety of positions in a comic book-style montage of pictures.</p> <p>One ad featured Jolie lying on her back across the bonnet of a car, holding a gun next to the text: \"We drove through the night at breathtaking speed, destroying everything in our path \u2026 welcome to the fraternity.

  "<p>This July, the militant anti-fascist organisation Antifa were in newspapers around the world because <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/06/germany\">one of its members</a> decapitated a waxwork Adolf Hitler in Berlin's Madame Tussauds. The attention-grabbing stunt was ultimately harmless, but other activities engaged in by the group are - in intention at least - far from benign.</p> <p>In the middle of August, the British National party held their annual <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/derbyshire/7543127.stm\">Red, White and Blue festival</a> in Denby, Derbyshire. The UK branch of Antifa who, like their European counterparts advocate the use of violence against neo-Nazis, planned to descend on the event. Postings on internet message boards encouraged people to join their bid to \"shut down\" the \"<a href=\"http://www.antifa.org.uk/nucleus3.32/nucleus332/smashbnp.php\">scumfest</a>\". One posting, boasting of Antifa's physical might, declared: \"Let them tremble at our wrath.\"</p> <p>The local <a href=\" http://www.24dash.com/news/Communities/2008-08-13-Police-to-control-anti-fascist-demonstration-at-BNP-festival\"> police</a> were so concerned about the threat they posed, they advised Amber Valley Borough Council not to grant the BNP a licence. They added that an 8ft Glastonbury style ring-of-steel fence along with dozens of security guards were needed to stave off trouble. In the face of the police's opposition, the BNP withdrew their licence application. But despite not being allowed to sell alcohol or host live music, the party <a href=\"http://www.thisisderbyshire.co.uk/news/BNP-festival-ahead-despite-licensing-setback/article-186767-detail/article.html\">went ahead</a> with the bash. When the festival kicked off on Saturday, August 16, the prospect of a bloody clash between thousands of BNP members and busloads of hardline anti-fascists seemed a real possibility. </p> <p>In the event, there was <a href=\" http://ukpress.google.com/article/ALeqM5igZNt7Z_BFzKCjyipkVCD-aIn4UQ\">a clash</a>, but it was over in less than 20 minutes and did not involve a single member of the BNP. After emerging from a field dressed in anarchist black and attempting to block the road with objects from farmyards, Antifa were dealt with \u2013 severely and quickly \u2013 by riot police. Assessed simply against their own aim - that of stopping the festival - the group's expedition to Derbyshire can only be seen as a complete failure. What should be of more concern to Antifa than impotency though, is that their actions served to help their opponents. By fighting with police, taking private property and scaring residents, they gifted the BNP a PR victory by allowing them to seem the more law-abiding and reasonable group. </p> <p>At the heart of BNP are some extremely unpleasant things, but they are anxious to keep their most unpalatable values behind a facade of normalcy, and even openness. For example, before Antifa arrived, I was given a tour of the festival site and saw, in the party merchandise stall, golliwogs dressed in BNP T-shirts. When our photographer raised his camera towards them however, he was stopped by BNP security. Elsewhere, there were creepy war-grave-style crosses marking victims of \"black-on-white race crime\", but Nick Griffin had happily posed flipping burgers for the kids, to all appearances the average family man. It is this practised deception that Antifa, in their contrasting lawlessness, help perpetuate.</p> <p>Some denunciation, outcry and opposition of the BNP is no doubt required. Hopefully Antifa's members now recognise that their approach was ineffective and counter-productive. At the other end of the road from where Antifa were beaten back by baton-wielding police and dog handlers with alsations, a dignified, peaceful protest against the Red, White and Blue Festival was taking place. Members of Unite Against Fascism, Stop the BNP and trade unions held a well-attended march and rally. Next year, I urge Antifa to take off their black bandannas and hoods, put down the missiles, and join them.<br></p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-337237771\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>The Republican convention finally got off the ground tonight with criticism of the US media for getting into a frenzy over the vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin and with a fleeting appearance by George Bush.</p> <p>There were regular ovations at the mention of Palin. But the loudest came with a spirited defence by Fred Thompson, the Law and Order actor who had stood against John McCain for the Republican nomination.</p> <p>In a comment that got delegates to their feet, he said: \"Some Washington pundits and media big shots are in a frenzy over the selection of a woman who has actually governed rather than just talked a good game on the Sunday talk shows and hit the Washington cocktail circuit.\"</p> <p>Palin, though only appointed McCain's running mate on Friday, has established herself as a favourite of the convention, mainly because she shares the social conservative values held by many of the delegates.</p> <p>Thompson had one of two prime-time television slots to build up a portrait of McCain, the Republican candidate for the November presidential race. But Palin is the talk of the convention and is turning out to be a distraction from the business of selling McCain. </p> <p>Although Thompson devoted most of his speech to McCain as war hero, he also spoke spiritedly about Palin, saying she is \"from a small town, with small town values, but that's not good enough for those folks who are attacking her and her family\".</p> <p>With the opening day yesterday cancelled because of Hurricane Gustav, the Republicans managed their first full day of business today. </p> <p>The other prime-time television slot was taken by Joe Lieberman, the former Democratic senator who is now an independent and is a long-time friend of McCain. Lieberman is reported to have been his original choice as running mate but was ruled out because he was unsellable to the Republican convention.</p> <p>But he received a standing ovation. He told the delegates that they might be puzzled at the presence of a Democrat at a Republican convention but he said he wanted to put country before party and that meant a vote for McCain.</p> <p>Lieberman made one of the few political remarks of the night as the Republicans judged it would be too insensitive to be overtly political in the wake of Gustav. </p> <p>Speaking about the war in Iraq he said: </p> <p>\"When others wanted to retreat in defeat from the field of battle, when Barack Obama was voting to cut off funding for our troops on the ground, John McCain had the courage to stand against the tide of public opinion.\" </p> <p>The convention had a strong militaristic overtone, with video clips of the war in Iraq and of former Republican presidents involved in conflict. About a dozen of McCain's fellow inmates in a Vietnam prisoner of war camp were in the audience. </p> <p>Bush joined the Republican convention last night by video link from the White House, a fudge that allowed John McCain to maintain his distance himself from the president.</p> <p>The president had been due to make a prime-time television appearance in person at the convention in St Paul, Minnesota, last night but ditched that to fly to Texas to be near evacuees from Louisiana fleeing Hurricane Gustav.</p> <p>Rather than fly on to Minnesota he opted to return to the White House. Even then, a planned 15-minute video was cut down to six, and he was given a slot just before prime time.</p> <p>Bush's short tribute to McCain's helped resolve the presidential candidate's dilemma. While Bush is popular with the convention and was loudly cheered when he appeared, he has one of the lowest poll ratings of any president and McCain has largely avoided campaigning with him</p> <p>Bush, recalling McCain's time in Vietnam, said that if the Hanoi Hilton could not break McCain, \"the angry left could not\". </p> <p>Bush, who has often been at odds with McCain on policy, put aside past differences to praise him as a potential commander-in-chief.</p> <p>\"We need a president who understands the lessons of September 11, 2001: That to protect America, we must stay on the offense, stop attacks before they happen, and not wait to be hit again. The man we need is John McCain,\" Bush said.</p>",
