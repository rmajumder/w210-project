  "<h2>YES</h2> <p><strong>Gerry Sutcliffe MP</strong> Minister for sport</p> <p>Of course there should be a Great Britain Football Team in 2012. Every weekend millions of people either play or watch our national pastime. It is part of our DNA. Travel to any corner of the Earth and you'll find a football shirt from a British club. </p> <p>So it would be ludicrous if, in 2012, we were to host the biggest sporting event in the world without representation in one of our most popular, most successful and most recognisable sporting exports. Why does a country, rich with footballing talent and success, fail to put forward a men's and women's team for the Olympic Games when it's a perfect opportunity to showcase our skills and win? Doesn't really make sense, does it? </p> <p>Fortunately I know this won't happen. One way or another there will be a GB team at the 2012 Games. The only question is, will they be a truly British team or an England XI playing under the union flag? </p> <p>I know what I want to see. The Team GB performance in Beijing showed us all just how much we can achieve together if we are united, not divided. It's a real pessimist who now, after the most successful GB performance in a century, suggests that the home nations should separate and go it alone. What further proof do we need than 47 medals - 19 of them gold - to show how much we can do as a team. And I've no doubt we could add to that tally by at least two medals in 2012 - in men's and women's football. </p> <p>Arguments about preserving individual nationality are frankly a bit of a smokescreen. There have been a number of direct assurances from Sepp Blatter that individual nations will not be affected by coming together for the Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2012. Like many fans I've wondered just how many World Cups a Team GB would have won. That problem left-side position for England wouldn't have been anything like a problem if Ryan Giggs was English, for example. But I'm an England fan and when it comes to World Cups and European Championships it's England, not Team GB I'm supporting. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland fans are probably the same. </p> <p>Being a passionate Brit and passionately English, Scottish, Welsh or Irish are not mutually exclusive. If Chris Hoy can get on a bike wearing a union flag one tournament and a Scottish flag the next, why can't a footballer do the same? </p> <p>More importantly why can't the people in charge of football in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland do the same? The English FA will protect their sovereignty at Fifa with equal vigour, yet they support a GB football team.<br> It's time to stop seeing these Games as a threat and start seeing them as an opportunity. Think how much of a boost there would have been to the women's game if the home countries' FAs hadn't opposed the England women's team playing in Beijing. Frankly I think that was a disgrace of a decision, but what's done is done. We now need to move on and I hope in the light of the fantastic performance of Team GB in Beijing we can make progress for a team in 2012 that represents the whole of Great Britain. </p> <p>An Olympics in Britain is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, so let's let go of petty politics and just get on with the Game. </p> <h2>NO</h2> <p><strong>Gordon Smith</strong> Chief executive of the Scottish FA<br> Before I am accused of indulging in rabid Scottish nationalist and anti-British sentiment, it is worth pointing out that I am all in favour of the Olympics and Britain's involvement in the Games. Indeed, I cheered the team on to their great success in the last few weeks. </p> <p>However, that does not make a British Olympic football team something which is necessary. Far from it; Scotland, Wales, England and Northern Ireland have always been autonomous where football is concerned and that is the way it should remain. There is no argument I have heard which overrides what long-term damage could be done to each country by a united team. </p> <p>As it stands, each of the four countries have their own place and voting rights on the Fifa international board after we played our part in keeping the organisation going many years ago. We have one vote per home nation country out of a total of eight votes; a huge say in how the game is run given there are more than 100 nations involved in world football's governing body. </p> <p>If we were to merge as one football nation, others would point out - and probably with justification - that our level of representation was unjust and ask that we voted as one. That would have massive implications for our ability to influence Fifa issues and our standing; a merged football team would therefore attack our constitutional rights. The possibility beyond that, of course, is that people would question why we retained individual national football teams and country-by-country representation in European football at all. It is a dangerous road to go down. </p> <p>I know there were football matches played at Beijing, but it was almost impossible to notice them. The reason? It is simply not a football competition. An event which should be the pinnacle of every sportsman and -woman's career does not represent that at all where football comes into it. Football in the Olympics has little impact at all. </p> <p>Ironically, the Scottish FA has been accused of being discriminatory by not supporting a Great Britain team, yet the Olympic organisers discriminate by virtue of their Under-23 ruling for football players. This is like telling athletes they cannot run in the 100m if they are over 30 or cyclists that they are banned after their 35th birthday; it is ridiculous, a piece of legislation only confined to one sport, and another example of why Olympic football carries little value or prominence, even in the eyes of legislators. </p> <p>The timing of the tournament is also hugely problematic. We would have a situation where players head to play in the Olympics in August, right at the start of both the domestic campaign throughout Britain and the qualification process for European football. The impact on home nation leagues, as well as our clubs' standing and coefficient in Europe, could only be negative. Added to that, we would hope the home nations had been competing in the 2012 European Championship only weeks earlier; surely nobody can argue it is fair to ask players to finish a club season in May, prepare for and participate in a major finals, go through pre-season with their club, start that season and then be forced to play in the Olympic Games. </p> <p>Already, simply I don't get the feeling among football supporters that there is an appetite for a united British team.</p>",
  "<p>Seth Lakeman came on like a pop star. \"I hope you won't stay seated for long,\" he announced, and soon there were altercations between would-be dancers and officials who clearly hadn't expected such behaviour from a folk audience. There, in a nutshell, is Lakeman's appeal. He may come from a folk background, and write songs based on the often bleak history and stories of his native Devon, but he looks and dresses like a boy-band pinup, and has just notched up a top 10 album. He is the perfect crossover artist.</p> <p>Lakeman has brought folk to new audiences by taking strong narratives and treating them with relentless attack. He was backed by insistent strumming from his own four-string tenor guitar and more varied violin work, and from a tight acoustic trio playing conventional guitar, double bass and percussion (with a dash of banjo or mandolin). The results were often spectacular, from the furious Take No Rogues to The Hurlers, a stomper about young men being turned to stone for playing sport rather than going to church. There was a drama and urgency that didn't vary even when he slowed down for the declamatory Greed and Gold, or when he played solo, backed by his own foot-stomping violin on Kitty Jay.</p> <p>All he lacked was variety - not in the instrumentation, but in the tone. He said Solomon Browne was \"the most poignant song\" on his new album, but this story of the 1981 Penlee lifeboat disaster was treated as yet another rhythmic romp, and the audience clapped along incongruously to this modern tragedy. Lakeman deserves his success, but a good storyteller needs to match excitement with soul and emotion.</p>",

Billy Wilder placed a box of Ivory Snow Flakes on a shelf behind Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray in the classic film noir, Double Indemnity (1944), Michael Curtiz dotted bottles of Jack Daniels around Mildred Pierce (1945) and Frank Capra had young George Bailey (Bobbie Anderson) read National Geographic magazine while dreaming of becoming an explorer in It's a Wonderful Life (1946).</p> <p>The most flagrant example from this period, however, occurred in the Marx Brothers's swan song, Love Happy (1949). Having struggled to bankroll the picture, co-producers Lester Cowan and Chico Marx concocted a Time Square chase sequence to sell space on the rooftop billboards over which Harpo clambered in making off with a pocketful of hot diamonds. By the end of the sequence, he had ridden Mobil Oil's red Pegasus mascot, swung on a giant Bulova clock pendulum and emerged exhaling smoke from the mouth of a penguin smoking a Kool cigarette.</p> <p><strong>TV spin-off movie seems to be making a comeback.

The nephew of silent siren Leatrice Joy, he was spotted by then-director George Cukor while accompanying his cousin, Leatrice Joy Gilbert, to an audition for the role of Suellen O'Hara that eventually went to Evelyn Keyes (who died on July 4). Struck by his strapping frame and lazy Southern drawl, Cukor cast Crane alongside future Superman George Reeves as the twins Brent and Stuart Tarleton - although they were wrongly credited on screen and the error proved too costly to correct. Ultimately, Crane's career rather petered out, but he did have the distinction of uttering the film's opening line to Vivien Leigh: \"What do we care if we were expelled from college, Scarlett? The war is going to start any day now, so we'd have left college anyhow.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336964241\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/08/26/dehallivand220.jpg\" alt=\"Olivia De Hallivand\" width=\"220\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Olivia de Havilland in 1950.

  "<p>The medical entomologist Professor Chris Curtis, who has died of cancer aged 68, was a pioneer of practical methods for control of insect carriers of tropical diseases, including malaria and lymphatic filariasis, or elephantiasis. He was a leading figure both as researcher and teacher whose work undoubtedly saved many thousands of lives.</p> <p>Chris was completely dedicated to the cause of useful science, in the service of practical public health. Born in Oxshott, Surrey, he graduated from Oxford University in 1961, and undertook research at Edinburgh for a PhD on the genetics of fungi. Soon he was looking for ways to apply genetics to the control of tsetse flies, which spread sleeping sickness, and developed these ideas at Bristol University from 1966 to 1972.</p> <p>He then turned to genetic control of mosquitoes, working with a World Health Organization unit in New Delhi, India. When false rumours about biological weapons forced the New Delhi unit to close, Chris joined the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in 1976, where he was based until his death.</p> <p>A rigorous theoretical scientist, Chris produced mathematical models of genetic control in insects and the evolution of resistance to insecticides which are still used today. However, his main focus for the rest of his life was appropriate technology for mosquito control, and in several cases the simple ideas he developed have now revolutionised how we control tropical diseases.</p> <p>One of these was to use polystyrene beads to form layers on the water surface of pit latrines and similar breeding sites of Culex mosquitoes, thereby denying the mosquito larvae access to the air they need to breathe. The trial of this idea resulted in a 98% reduction in these filariasis-carrying mosquitoes in a small town in Zanzibar.</p> <p>From the 1980s onwards, Chris's main research focused on controlling malaria mosquitoes with insecticide-treated nets. Such nets are now a mainstay of effective malaria-control programmes worldwide. Chris was involved in the development of this technology at every stage, from the basic entomological work, through village-scale trials, to strategies for large-scale implementation. A seminal hypothesis was that if most people in a village used such nets, a \"mass effect\" would reduce the entire mosquito population and thereby protect even those without nets.</p> <p>Chris's team was the first to propose this hypothesis and to demonstrate that it happens in practice. Armed with the scientific facts, Chris developed this concept into a political argument in favour of \"free nets\" - the principle that donor funds should be used to provide treated nets to everyone in areas of high transmission.</p> <p>He became a tireless and highly influential campaigner for this cause, and against the notion that nets should be sold, or targeted only to specific groups. In doing so, he contributed (with many others) to a significant strengthening of political will in developed countries, and thus to a truly vast increase in donor-funding for malaria control. Now, about 50m treated nets have been given away for free in the way that Chris promoted, preventing tens of thousands of deaths due to malaria among African children.</p> <p>Invariably straightforward, he had a luminous integrity that sometimes bordered on the naive, and lacked any pretensions. Though Chris never assembled a big research team, his impact was immense. He worked productively with colleagues from many disciplines all over the world and was always happy to help everyone. Chris's values will be carried on by those he taught, and his influence as a figure of inspiration may prove to be even more important than his contributions to science. He will be remembered for his gentle sense of humour, his unfailing support and his generosity. Although he retired five years ago, Chris continued his usual classroom teaching until his final illness. </p> <p>At Oxford, he met and married his wife Jill, to whom he was devoted; she survives him. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Christopher Francis Curtis, medical entomologist, born September 25 1939; died May 13 2008</p>",
  "<p>Sixty children were killed in air strikes by US-led coalition warplanes in western Afghanistan last week, a UN investigation has found. UN investigators said they discovered \"convincing evidence\" that a total of 90 Afghan civilians died in the incident.</p> <p>The toll, potentially the worst since the fall of the Taliban in 2001, could wreck relations between the Afghan government and the Nato-led coalition forces, which were already under severe strain over civilian casualties and strategy in the counter-insurgency against the Taliban. </p> <p>The government of President Hamid Karzai has ordered that any military operation by foreign forces on its territory will be subject to a new set of rules enforceable under international law. </p> <p>Kai Eide, the UN special envoy to Afghanistan who ordered the investigation, said the incident could undermine the faith of the Afghan people in international efforts to stabilise the country.</p> <p>Military sources said the air strikes last Thursday on the Shindand district of Herat province were carried out not by the Nato force attempting to bolster Karzai's government, but as part of a parallel US mission targeting al-Qaida and Taliban militants, called Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF).</p> <p>US officials initially said that the air strikes were aimed at a Taliban stronghold and had killed 30 jihadis. An OEF spokesman in Kabul said last night that an investigation into the incident had been launched last Saturday and was still under way.</p> <p>In his report, Eide said investigators from the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (Unama) found that up to eight houses in the village of Nawabad had been destroyed in the raids and many others damaged.</p> <p>\"Investigations by Unama found convincing evidence, based on the testimony of eyewitnesses, and others, that some 90 civilians were killed, including 60 children, 15 women and 15 men. Fifteen other villagers were wounded or otherwise injured,\" Eide wrote.</p> <p>\"This is matter of grave concern to the United Nations, I have repeatedly made clear that the safety and welfare of civilians must be considered above all else during the planning and conduct of all military operations. The impact of such operations undermines the trust and confidence of the Afghan people in efforts to build a just, peaceful, and law-abiding state.\"</p> <p>Humayun Hamidzada, a spokesman for the Afghan president, said Karzai had ordered that all foreign military operations be governed by an internationally enforceable \"status of forces agreement\".</p> <p>\"The patience of the Afghan people has run out. We no longer can afford to see the killing of our children,\" Hamidzada said.</p> <p>The incident comes at a fraught time for western forces in Afghanistan, after a week of high casualties and deep splits within Nato on sharing the burden of the Afghan conflict. </p> <p>Eide was appointed to bring some coordination to the international community's disparate efforts. But last night he warned that those efforts were in danger of being crippled by public mistrust.</p> <p>In a harshly worded statement, he said: \"I want to remind all parties engaged in the conflict that the protection of civilians must be their primary concern; they must respect their duties under international humanitarian and human rights law to protect the people we are here to serve.\"</p>",
  "<p>For many high-profile public figures, a visit to the libel courts has become something akin to a trip to the casino: victory triggers a large windfall and a substantially enhanced reputation.</p> <p>Yesterday, Sir Salman Rushdie achieved the latter, but notably turned his back on the chance of a big payday as his legal team forced an apology from a former policeman who had painted a disparaging picture of the author in a sensationalist book.</p> <p>Four thousand copies of Ron Evans's account of his life as a protection officer have been pulped and unreserved apologies were offered in court yesterday by his publisher and his ghost writer. But while Rushdie's costs were met, he eschewed the prospect of damages, preferring a swift retraction of falsehoods which first appeared in a newspaper serialisation and then travelled around the world as they were copied by innumerable websites.</p> <p>After the declaration of falsity was accepted, Rushdie said he was pleased with the speedy verdict and hoped his victory would spur others on to challenge falsehoods without demanding damages. He had succeeded in finding \"a new method by which to establish the fact\", he said. \"It seems to me to be unconvincing that a huge, large amount of money will improve your reputation. It just means that your lawyers are better than the other person's lawyers. But to have the court stating that certain things are untrue seems to me to be emphatic.\"</p> <p>Rushdie added: \"Over the years I have been a part of the hurly-burly of the British press and there has been plenty that has been said about me that has been rude and unsupportive. I have never sought to pursue expressions of opinion. However, facts are facts and lies are lies. And it seems to me that the law exists to allow people to clarify that.\"</p> <p>Yesterday, Geoffrey Robertson QC, for Rushdie, said his client had \"pioneered a new way of reconciling the right to freedom of speech with the right to reputation: you nail the lie for all time with a court-ordered declaration of falsity and you receive your legal costs, but you decline to chill free speech by putting authors and publishers [through] an expensive trial and making them pay heavy damages.\"</p> <p>Written by a former police officer who claimed to have protected Rushdie during the fatwa years, the Sunday newspaper serialisation made a number of hurtful claims. Apparently, Rushdie was such a pain that officers locked him in a room so they could go to the pub; he was trying to profit from the fatwa; he was unhygienic; taxpayers footed the bill for his safe houses; his nickname was \"Scruffy\". The work even claimed his third wife, Elizabeth West, had only married him for his money.</p> <p>It would have been a sensation - if any of the allegations had been true. Yesterday, in the high court in London, the book's publishers, John Blake, its author, Evans, and his ghostwriter, Douglas Thompson, admitted 11 counts of falsehood. They issued an \"unreserved\" apology to Rushdie and West and agreed to pay the author's costs, estimated at \u00a310,000-15,000.</p> <p>Rushdie complained after the Mail on Sunday serialisation and thousands of copies of the book, On Her Majesty's Service, were destroyed before ever reaching the shops, the court heard. A new edition, with the offending paragraphs removed, will appear soon.</p> <p>Rushdie, 61, was in court alongside West, his wife before last. She met Rushdie 18 months into the fatwa - which was ordered in 1988 by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the spiritual leader of Iran - and stayed with him for 10 years until he left her for his next (now ex-) wife, the Indian actor and model Padma Lakshmi. The couple's 11-year-old son Milan also attended.</p> <p>Speaking after the hearing, Rushdie dismissed Evans's role in his police protection team, saying he merely drove around the special branch officers who were paid to protect him, and only for a \"short time\". What's more, Rushdie added, Evans \"was known throughout the police force as Dodgy Ron\". There seems to be some justification for this nickname: David Sherborne, representing Rushdie, told the court yesterday that Evans left the police force in 2005 after being convicted of nine counts of dishonesty.</p> <h2>Pulped fiction</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> In 1988, Robert Maxwell succeeded in getting copies of an unauthorised biography pulped after winning a high court action. Maxwell's solicitor said the book contained 30 serious libels.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Alan Sugar managed to get all unsold copies of Terry Venables's autobiography pulped in 1996 as part of a settlement of a libel action against the former England football manager. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> A novel by crime writer Jake Arnott had to be pulped in August 2006. One fictional character, Tony Rocco, a retired big-band singer and big-time pervert, shared a name with the real Tony Rocco, a former big-band singer and upstanding member of society.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This month, champion jockey Kieron Fallon got an unauthorised biography removed from sale. It repeated a false allegation by former jockey Stuart Webster that Fallon launched an unprovoked attack on him in 1994.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Monday September 1 2008. Former policeman Ron Evans, an officer who worked with the police protection team assigned to Salman Rushdie, wrote On Her Majesty's Service.

  "<p>In the northern French town of Abb\u00e9ville it was two 16-year-old girls, found unconscious in their school toilets after feting a birthday with the help of four cherry-flavoured alcopops each and a bottle of vodka. In the Ain d\u00e9partement of central France, it was an 18-year-old student, found dead in his bed by his father following a Friday night spent celebrating the end of his baccalaur\u00e9at.</p> <p>And last week, in Paimpol on the Atlantic coast, it was a 16-year-old girl on a family camping holiday, hospitalised with an alcohol-induced coma after drinking three litres of spirits with a couple of friends. Her father is suing the supermarket that sold them the alcohol. </p> <p>For years, the French have dismissed out-of-control teenage drinking, like hooliganism, as \"a British disease\". France, it was said (by the French but by us, too), had the right approach to alcohol and kids: start them off young, in early adolescence, with a glass of watered-down wine at family meals. That way they grow up understanding that a drop of Burgundy or Bordeaux over dinner is, generally speaking, preferable to 15 pints down the pub. France, we thought, had mastered the art of moderate drinking: being falling-down drunk was neither cool nor sexy; alcohol was just one of the many components of the great Gallic social experience; and leglessness was not synonymous with fun.</p> <p>That did not, of course, mean that France did not (and does not) have problems with alcohol: while the influence of the wine lobby has left much of the nation in clear denial, a 2005 government study unambiguously classified <br>5 million French people as \"excessive drinkers\", and 2 million as chronically alcohol-dependent, estimating that booze was behind a third of all custodial sentences in France and more than half of all domestic violence. One way or another, the report said, alcohol is directly responsible for 23,000 deaths a year across the Channel, and indirectly for a further 22,000.</p> <p>But this was long-term, adult drinking; a pattern of abuse and dependence in a minority - albeit a significant one - established, in most cases, over years of vinous overconsumption. Until very recently, beyond a few drunken British and German holidaymakers, the French had simply not been exposed to the phenomenon of young people setting out deliberately to drink themselves drunk. As recently as 2006, the psychologist Marie Choquet could tell a national conference on alcohol and drug abuse that alcohol was \"culturally integrated\" in France, and that such practices could never take root there. </p> <p>Now, however, newspaper articles and TV documentaries are full of anguished reports on la biture express and la d\u00e9fonce minute, Gallic neologisms that appear to be fighting a losing battle against that very Anglo-Saxon import, le binge drinking.</p> <p>\"It is becoming an issue,\" says Dr Philippe Batel, an alcohol specialist at the Beaujon hospital in Clichy. \"Statistics are never completely clear, of course, but it's clear there is a significant change in behaviour under way - there's now a real trend among French youths to drink more regularly, usually at weekends; to drink more; to drink outside, in the streets; and to drink in order to get smashed. All that is really quite new in France, and it corresponds quite closely to the British definition of binge drinking.\" </p> <p>It has not yet, experts agree, attained the proportions seen in Britain or other, mainly northern European countries. But if you believe the statistics, it does indeed seem to be climbing at an alarming rate: according to a recent government survey of 30,000 French 17-year-olds, of the 12% who qualify as regular drinkers, 26% confess to getting regularly drunk, compared with 19% five years ago. Worse, while alcohol consumption among the population in general is falling steadily, fully half of all French teenagers now report having been drunk at least once in the previous month. </p> <p>The figures have prompted the health minister, Roselyne Bachelot, to announce a string of measures aimed at curbing binge drinking among the young. A package of bills to be presented to parliament at the end of the summer recess and scheduled to come into force next year will, the minister told the Journal du Dimanche recently, include the \"total prohibition of alcohol sales to minors\", and a ban on alcohol consumption in the immediate proximity of schools. She also plans to end \"open-bar\" events, common at student parties, at which guests pay a flat fee in advance to drink as much as they want. (At present, French teenagers can buy beer and wine in cafes, bars and supermarkets from the age of 16; spirits are reserved for the over-18s.) </p> <p>The ministry has also launched a hard-hitting advertising campaign, Boire trop (or Drinking too much) featuring a video of an apparently innocent beach party that, way too many drinks later, ends up in a drowning, a rape, a violent fight and someone collapsing in a coma. (Though the main response from France's youth to the clip on YouTube, unfortunately, has been a chorus of enthusiastic praise for the catchy Brazilian soundtrack by Silvano Michelino, and of regret that there seems to be nowhere that allows one to download the song for free.) </p> <p>Some towns, especially those with high student populations, have clearly decided not to wait. To the outrage of bar and nightclub owners already hard hit by France's January 1 ban on smoking in public places, the university town of Nantes has banned happy hours, after two students stumbled out of a cafe and fell straight into the river Loire. The local council in Rennes, which is home to two major universities, has taken the even more radical step of buying up a number of bars on the cobbled Rue Saint Michel, better known to locals as the Rue de la Soif (Thirst Street) and turning them - among other things - into a DVD outlet and an upmarket restaurant.</p> <p>So what's gone wrong? What has prompted France's youth to turn from sensible tipplers to full-on booze abusers? Experts, predictably, are as divided about what lies behind the problem as they are about how best to tackle it. Etienne Apaire, who heads up an inter-ministerial body aimed at combating both drug and alcohol addiction, has told French media that he believes the phenomenon is simply part of a \"globalisation of behaviour\" evident in all 27 EU member states, in which teenagers increasingly seek \"instant intoxication\" as an end in itself.</p> <p>A leading social economist, Jean-Michel Reynaud, says the drinks industry is largely to blame. \"It bears a major and absolute responsibility,\" he told Lib\u00e9ration. The re-emergence in France of mainly British-made pre-mixed alcopops, which first appeared in the mid-1990s but were so heavily taxed by the then Socialist government that they were largely withdrawn from the market, \"has made drunkenness among young people commonplace. The ever-mounting pressure to consume is meticulously organised.\" </p> <p>Batel says a combination of both the above is probably the cause, plus \"an ever-increasing pressure to perform\" that encourages \"weekend excess\". But some influential figures, including government health advisers, are even beginning to question the wisdom of allowing children as young as nine or 10 to develop a taste for wine, arguing that this \"authorises drinking\" and noting that recent studies have thrown up convincing evidence that those who start drinking before they reach 18 are far more likely to consume to excess as adults.</p> <p>Suggestions about how best to combat the latest Anglo-Saxon scourge are equally varied. One educationalist, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Gardien, says French parents have to get tough again; they no longer give the kind of strict guidelines they used to and that teenagers need, he says. But if many teenage drinkers seem to be cynical about the government's very un-French proposals, arguing that they can always find an adult to buy booze for them, most experts seem to approve - although some fear outright bans on teenagers are often counter-productive. </p> <p>\"The signal sent by a total ban on the sale of alcohol to minors is very important in a country like France, which has always tended to deny that alcohol can be harmful,\" says Batel. \"But there needs to be a strong preventive strategy to accompany it. We need to be able to discuss openly with young people, without taboos, the dangers and the attractions of alcohol.\" Otherwise the Saturday-night city-centre streets of sensible, wine-sipping France could soon be looking the same way as those in Britain, parts of Scandinavia and eastern Europe and, most recently, Spain.

  "<p>Sovereign wealth fund Temasek, which came to prominence last year after a controversial investment in Barclays, yesterday joined the chorus of concern that the global credit crisis has further to run.</p> <p>The fund, an investment arm of the Singapore government, warned of further contagion from the losses and write-downs suffered by western banks despite doubling profits to $18bn (\u00a39.7bn).</p> <p>In a confident statement of its intent to pick up bargains in the finance sector, the $185bn fund said it had benefited in recent years from expanding its investments in Asia and limiting its exposure to western countries.</p> <p>\"The fallout of the credit crisis will continue to dampen the global economy over the next 24 months, with sharply escalated oil and food prices beginning to test inflation expectations,\" chairman S. Dhanabalan said in the fund's annual report.</p> <p>However, it said it saw value in the European and US banking industries, despite the sub-prime disaster which has forced banks to write off more than \u00a3250bn.</p> <p>Last summer, ahead of the credit crunch, it poured more than \u00a32bn into Barclays for a 2.1% stake. Later it became one of the saviours of the US banking industry with a $5bn injection into Merrill Lynch for a 9% stake.</p> <p>Rumours have circulated that the fund will step in to rescue Lehman Brothers, the US investment bank.</p> <p>Yet while western banks have courted Temasek to shore up their ailing finances, many western governments have remained sceptical that their motives are purely financial.</p> <p>Government-owned investment vehicles such as Temasek and its bigger sister agency, the Government of Singapore Investment Corp (GIC), control over $2 trillion in assets - more than the combined value of the main German and Australian stock indices - and are expected to grow to $12 trillion by 2015.</p> <p>Temasek denies any political motives. \"The financial services industry is one we believe in,\" Manish Kejriwal, Temasek's senior managing director for investment, International and India, said at its annual briefing yesterday. </p> <p>Analysts said the strategy followed by the fund had realised huge profits at the expense of further exposure to the financial sector. </p> <p>Anshukant Taneja, who covers Temasek for ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor's, said it had increased its exposure to unpredictable asset cycles and contagion.</p> <p>\"This may impact Temasek's ability to divest its stake in various entities and manage its portfolio,\" said Taneja. </p> <p>Another of the fund's high profile investments centres on Standard Chartered bank, which has largely avoided the worst of the write-downs. Temasek raised its holding in Standard Chartered over the past year to 19% from 13%.</p>",
  "<p>Virgin Atlantic and British Airways traded verbal blows over the botched launch of Heathrow's Terminal 5 yesterday as BA's rival claimed a 38% rise in pre-tax profits.</p> <p>The carrier founded by Sir Richard Branson reignited its feud with BA by claiming it enjoyed a strong start to the financial year thanks to \"ongoing\" problems at T5. BA hit back, saying the terminal is working well after its troubled debut, and \"it is not surprising if other airlines are envious\".</p> <p>Heathrow's largest carrier has sought to dispel any lingering public concern over the building with an advertising campaign that gives the public live updates on security queues and check-in times.</p> <p>\"We do not recognise Virgin's claims to be taking business from us on the grounds that passengers do not like Terminal 5,\" BA said.</p> <p>The latest spat spread to Virgin Atlantic's financial results, released yesterday. The privately held carrier said pre-tax profits excluding exceptional items rose from \u00a344m to \u00a360.9m in the financial year to February, on sales up 9.1% to \u00a32.4bn, including a contribution from tour operator Virgin Holidays. Passenger numbers over the period rose 7.6% to 5.7 million.</p> <p>\"Against the backdrop of high oil prices and weakening consumer demand, we are well placed to succeed over the coming months,\" said Steve Ridgway, Virgin Atlantic's chief executive. BA said Virgin Atlantic's results indicated a pre-tax profit margin of \"only\" 2.6%, which paled in comparison to the 10% margin that BA achieved in recent annual results.</p> <p>\"In the same year, British Airways achieved a pre-tax profit margin ... nearly four times higher,\" BA said. Virgin Atlantic responded that BA had an unfair advantage due to its lucrative slot portfolio at Heathrow, where it owns 40% of the take-off and landing berths.</p> <p>Relations between the carriers came under renewed strain recently when BA chief executive Willie Walsh accused Branson of sounding like a \"cracked record\" in his opposition to a planned alliance between BA and American Airlines. The Virgin tycoon returned to the theme yesterday, choosing to dwell on the AA tie-up rather than the increase in profits.</p> <p>\"Unless the regulators block the proposed BA/AA monopoly, consumers will lose out - and they'll pay higher ticket prices for the privilege,\" he said.</p> <p>Virgin Atlantic said pre-tax profits in the first three months of the current financial year were \u00a323.5m, with sales up 16% at \u00a3645.3m. It attributed that in part to the T5 effect.</p> <p>Analysts believe its chances of recording a full-year profit are low when more profitable carriers such as Ryanair and BA are warning that they will struggle to break even. The strongest are expected to seek deals such as the BA/AA tie-up, and the impact of high fuel costs and softening passenger demand will burn up their cash balances. Virgin Atlantic said it had cash reserves of \u00a3838m at the end of June.</p> <p>Virgin Atlantic's rivalry with BA centres on the Heathrow-New York market, where both carriers enjoy strong positions but face increased competition following the liberalisation of transatlantic air travel through the Open Skies treaty.</p> <p>\"While the outlook remains pretty overcast for the aviation industry, the winners will be those airlines that focus on offering the best customer service and which are nimble enough to take advantage of the opportunities that lie ahead,\" Ridgway said.</p>",
  "<p>Becky Adlington had only just put Mansfield on the map, and here she was trying to stop her ecstatic home town disappearing again.</p> <p>\"No, no, that wouldn't do at all,\" she cried, as plans to rename the whole place Adlington for the night were revealed before she jumped on an open-top bus to deafening cheers.</p> <p>Two pubs and her own street already have temporary new signs and a \u00a34.5m swimming pool is going to be the Rebecca Adlington Centre for ever. Why not go the whole hog, the Dickson family, festooned with union flags in Market Square, wanted to know? And they weren't the only ones.</p> <p>Adlington's eyebrows arched and her mouth dropped - but then, typically for an Olympian whose homely background has made her a national favourite, her formidable family weighed in.</p> <p>\"There already is an Adlington,\" her mother, Kay, told a welcoming reception at Mansfield civic centre firmly. \"In fact two,\" she added. \"And this is Mansfield.\" </p> <p>Rebecca nodded vigorously. \"It is,\" she said. \"This is where I grew up and I love it. I just feel proud to come from here, let alone having anything named after me.\"</p> <p>The tone was exactly right for at least 5,000 people who watched the double-decker trundle past in evening sunshine, with Adlington still marvelling at her gift from the town council. \"I made a promise before the Olympics, and here it is,\" said Mansfield's elected mayor, Tony Egginton, before disappearing into a huge cardboard box filled with tissue paper. A tug on the pale blue ribbon and the sides collapsed. Out of the confusion emerged the mayor and a maroon velvet cushion, embroidered with a gold inscription and topped by a pair of gold Jimmy Choo shoes.</p> <p>\"Ooh, can I try them on?\" said Adlington, unfazed by heels which looked as high as one of her fellow-Olympian Tom Daley's diving platforms. But the mayor wasn't having that. There was a bus to catch and hundreds of children jumping up and down shouting \"Sign my flag!\" She did - and she made a point of promising to encourage the next generation to follow in her footsteps. Still wearing her Team GB tracksuit, Adlington, who won gold in the 400m and 800m freestyle and set a world record in the 800m, said: \"I just hope that loads of young people get involved in sport. It needn't be to win, it can just be for fun. But get involved.\"</p> <p>The rallying cry drew loud applause from one woman in the crowd who remembered the 19-year-old as a tot who almost seemed to have fins. Glenda Hinde, shepherding a posse of primary school pupils, said: \"I lived next door to her swimming teacher, Maureen Pitchfork. She was a very special person - she got into the final of the 1954 Commonwealth games. She inspired the kids and I'm sure Rebecca will do the same.\"</p> <p>The children were equally eager. What did Leshane Aldridge, nine, think of Mansfield's heroine? \"She's a very good swimmer and the whole of our family's very proud of her,\" she said solemnly. </p> <p>Back at Berry Hill, where every house in Adlington's road was draped with flags, Karen Wall, who lives near the Adlingtons, looked across at her street's newly adapted sign. Looping pink letters have renamed Ryedale Avenue after the swimmer.</p> <p>\"I don't know who did that, but no one's disagreeing round here,\" she said, before going to wave more flags in Market Square. \"She's such a genuine person, is Rebecca. All us neighbours went round last night and she stayed on the street for ages, signing autographs for the children.</p> <p>\"She'd only just flown from Beijing and she'd had all the interviews at London airport and met Gordon Brown. But she stayed out there until everyone had got what they wanted. She didn't get tired or say stop, I've had enough. Just like she didn't in the races she won.\"</p>",
  "<p>Lord Triesman is poised to step up activity on England's World Cup 2018 bid with a whirlwind eight-day tour of football's powerbrokers. The most important stop on the journey will be Trinidad, where he will attempt to patch up his differences with Jack Warner at a dinner to celebrate the Trinidad &amp; Tobago Football Federation's centenary. Warner, a Fifa vice-president, has been Triesman's most outspoken critic since the chairman declined to attend the Fifa congress in Sydney in May. That was due to Triesman having to undergo an operation which clashed with the date but Warner was put out that he also missed England's friendly international in Port of Spain days later. </p> <p>Triesman, who has a dual role as chairman of the FA's World Cup bid company, will head for the Caribbean after a first stop at Uefa's Super Cup in Monaco, where Manchester United will take on Zenit St Petersburg. He has a close relationship with Michel Platini but must tread a delicate line after the Uefa president stated he expected there to be only one European bidder to stage the 2018 tournament.</p> <p>With delegates in Monaco from Russia's federation - a declared bidder - and representatives present from the Iberian and Benelux nations, which also harbour ambitions to host 2018, it will be an important lobbying opportunity for the FA. The rest of the itinerary is a closely guarded secret, with one FA official yesterday prepared to say only that Triesman was going on holiday.</p> <h2>FA starts executive search</h2> <p>The Football Association is preparing a tender for headhunters to find the replacement for Brian Barwick as chief executive, although it will not know what type of candidate it is looking for until its board meeting next month. The FA's board will draw up the profile of the man or woman to carry through the latest restructuring ordered by Lord Triesman. Meanwhile, amid employee discontent about moving from the shiny central London offices at Soho Square to the national stadium in suburban Wembley, the FA has engaged a legal firm to act as external adviser on employment law issues. Mace &amp; Jones will also act for the FA on its World Cup bid and employment matters arising from the construction of the National Football Centre at Burton-on-Trent.</p> <h2>Indians seek investment</h2> <p>In the face of attempts by the Board of Control for Cricket in India to put it out of business, the rebel Indian Cricket League is seeking external investment. Talks are under way with a number of hedge funds and venture capitalists over the possibility of shareholdings in the league's eight teams. The ICL franchises will be competing for television viewers with Australia's Test tour of India. Given the ICL's hugely popular Twenty20 format, the potential investors - as well as the BCCI - will be monitoring figures very closely.</p> <h2>How Coe coaxed coach</h2> <p>Lord Coe has had a quiet hand in Charles van Commenee's expected return to UK Athletics. Coe sat next to the man who coached Denise Lewis, right, to heptathlon gold in Sydney during Great Britain's 1-0 defeat to Holland in the men's hockey on August 13 and impressed upon the Dutchman how much the sport in Britain has missed him. A week later UK Athletics' chairman, Ed Warner, informed Coe of plans to approach Van Commenee in time to turn round his sport's Beijing disappointment in 2012.</p> <h2>Read all about it</h2> <p>When the Daily Mirror ran a story recently claiming that Manchester City's Stephen Ireland and Vedran Corluka were being sold without the approval of their manager, Mark Hughes, the club's denial was so vehement as to include a solicitors' letter being circulated to all newspapers warning them not to repeat the allegation. The article \"contained defamatory and untrue statements in respect of the club; [the chairman] Thaksin Shinawatra; [an agent] Kia Joorabchian; and [chief operating officer] Paul Aldridge\". Threatened with legal action, the Mirror duly removed the story from its website. Yet despite the club taking such exception to the story, it can still be read on the What the Papers Say section of City's official website.</p>",
  "<p>Eddie Jones is an unlikely champion of Sir Clive Woodward, given the verbal darts they fired at each other earlier this decade when they were in charge of Australia and England respectively. His views now on his erstwhile rival contrast with those of Twickenham's director of rugby, Rob Andrew, who yesterday launched an attack on the state Woodward left his national setup in after winning the World Cup in 2003.</p> <p>Woodward was not named but Andrew left little room for doubt when he claimed that the World Cup-winning coaching team \"left no legacy to the English game. When the edifice fell over [after the tournament] there was nothing behind it\".</p> <p>Jones is not the most obvious ally. When in 2002 he responded to Woodward's tactical criticisms by observing of England, \"They're probably the best side in the world, mate, they know how to do everything\", his sarcasm level was off the scale. After beating Jones's Australia in 2003 Woodward sniped: \"He obviously spends more time planning his press conferences than he does his training sessions.\" Before the 2003 World Cup final Jones disparaged England's \"defensive\" style and responded to rumours of a knighthood for Woodward by observing sourly: \"Will I have to call him Sir Clive?\"</p> <p>Now, though, away from the crucible of Ashes clashes, Jones strikes a more emollient tone. \"Clive is a very bright, inventive person,\" said Jones, who is preparing for his first season in charge of Saracens, 17 years after his first experience of English rugby as a hooker with Leicester in 1991. \"He has smart ideas on preparation and we have made plans to catch up with each other in October and I will certainly be inviting him to a training session. We used to have a go at each other in the media but it was a bit of fun and we have had a few coffees together since we stopped coaching our countries.\"</p> <p>The Premiership will be a brighter place for Jones's presence. A keen student of the game, he watches tapes of matches from all over the world and is never afraid to express his opinion. If working at Saracens is a new experience for him, the nine-month European season contrasting with the three months he was used to in the Super 14 series or the 12 matches a year Australia played, he has prepared for it thoroughly, drawing on the success of Wasps and Leicester this decade.</p> <p>\"You need depth in your squad,\" he said. \"I have spent a lot of time planning the season: we will look to break it up into stages, making sure we keep the players fresh and enthusiastic. Wasps have done that extremely well over the years and we have to learn from that. I am really excited because there are so many good players in England. Saracens is a word which relates to a nomadic club and I guess we have moved about a bit without getting many trophies. I see my job as setting the foundation for sustained success.\"</p> <p>Jones has coached in Australia and Japan since being fired by the Wallabies in 2005, and he spent the end of the season before last at Saracens, helping the club avoid relegation, before acting as a consultant for South Africa at last year's World Cup when he finally got one over on England. The Springboks have since declined, struggling to get to grips with the experimental law variations being trialled this season. Jones is one of the few Australians contemptuous of the law changes.</p> <p>\"This year's Tri Nations has been awful,\" he said. \"I watched South Africa and New Zealand the other day and they were like Japanese university teams, tapping and running all the time. The ELVs are making rugby more generic and generic games are popular entertainment because they are simple. We have to keep rugby a complex sport: entertainment comes out of it being played and refereed well. When the variations are voted on next year the only concern must be the game itself and its integrity, not commercial issues.</p> <p>\"Rugby needs its own answer to cricket's Twenty20 which, through its popularity, allows the five-day game to survive unchanged. Maybe we should invent Twenty12: 12 players playing 20-minute matches under the variations.\"</p> <p>Jones believes that England will flourish in the coming years. \"They have a lot of talent to draw on,\" he said. \"I am sure that Martin Johnson will get the best out of his players and coaches, but England have to take greater advantage of their big forward pack than they have done in recent times. If Johnson gets that right, they will get back to third or fourth in the world very quickly.\"</p> <h2>Jones v Woodward: friendly fire</h2> <p>\"Our guys have to earn a Wallaby jumper. England obviously have a different selection policy\"</p> <p><strong>Eddie Jones kicks the feud off in 2001 with a barbed comment at Clive Woodward's decision to fast-track rugby league recruit Henry Paul</strong></p> <p>\"Does Eddie have the balls to utilise his own cross-code players Mat Rogers and Wendell Sailor with immediate effect?\"</p> <p><strong>Woodward's riposte</strong></p> <p>\"Australia used the old Eddie Jones trick of having decoy runners in front of the ball carrier\"</p> <p><strong>Woodward calls a press conference after England had beaten Australia at Twickenham to highlight, through the use of video tapes, the Wallabies' alleged cheating</strong></p> <p>\"No. Apparently he is still looking at Clive's videos\"</p> <p><strong>Jones a few months later when asked if he had had a chance to meet match referee Paul Honiss</strong></p> <p>\"England do not have to be boring. They choose to be\"</p> <p><strong>A pre-World Cup barb from Jones in 2003</strong></p> <p>\"I get paid to win Test matches. I think the last four games we've played in Australia, we've won four out of four. It's the only stat I know, and that's what we pride ourselves on. And how you go about it is entirely up to you\"</p> <p><strong>Woodward responds</strong></p> <p>\"Either you engage in the media contest or you don't. Like it or not, it's part of the media landscape\"</p> <p><strong>Jones admits to a media-savvy approach to unsettling the opposition, one thing at least he and Woodward can agree upon </strong></p> <p>\"Probably Eddie Jones has never had a better chance of beating England. He hasn't succeeded yet\"</p> <p><strong>Woodward's mischievous taunt in 2004 when England were weakened by retirement and injury </strong></p> <p>\"It's a bit of fun, isn't it?\"</p> <p><strong>Jones sees the bright side of the pair's public spats </strong></p>",
  "<p>If the resignation of President Pervez Musharraf represented a step forward for Pakistan's nascent democratic transition, the collapse of the ruling coalition this week underlined its delicacy. This is a crucial time for the international community, and the United States in particular, to review its relationship with Pakistan - especially when it comes to a strategy for defeating the Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan, and the terrorist threat across the wider region. </p> <p>To begin with, the US must invest more confidence and resources in Pakistan's civil society and its civilian, democratic leadership. The last general election, held in February, in which secular political parties won landslide victories at the expense of extremist groups, reflects the true aspirations of the people, which must be nurtured and supported. </p> <p>Next, the US must recognise the utter futility of working with the Pakistani military establishment. A politically compromised institution, the army is complacent about confronting terrorism and has, over the past seven years, sought to undermine the international effort to stabilise Afghanistan. </p> <p>Above all, the US has to realise that it cannot win the war on terror in Afghanistan's territory. Indeed, to the extent that the terrorist threat in Afghanistan emanates from sanctuaries across the border in Pakistan, it is in Pakistan that terrorism must be defeated. No other strategy stands any chance. </p> <p>Radical though expanding the war on terror into Pakistan may sound, it is not implausible or unrealistic. A few practical steps may be taken: first, the US must initiate a crucial debate about revising the existing modus operandi of the international forces in Afghanistan, currently divided into two separate missions - the Nato-led International Security Assistance Force (Isaf), and the US-led Coalition Joint Task Force. Political assent from allies around the world and Pakistan's leadership will allow a geographical expansion of the theatre of war. </p> <p>In the new arrangement, Isaf must be strengthened to take on a greater role in building up Afghan security forces and help the Afghan government to expand the rule of law across the country. The counter-terrorism mission, on the other hand, must be entrusted to a revitalised, US-led coalition of the willing that includes the newly constituted Afghan national army and the Pakistani military. Without having to invade Pakistani territory, the coalition should establish a viable presence by opening military bases on Pakistani soil. A supreme commander, with deputies from Afghanistan and Pakistan, should be appointed to devise and implement an effective counter-terrorism strategy for operations on both sides of the Durand line that separates the two countries. The coalition should also ensure the security of Pakistan's dangerous nuclear arsenal and prevent any potential proliferation. </p> <p>In doing the above, the US must not be deterred by predictions of a possible public backlash in Pakistan as a result of international military intervention. The assumption, widely held in the west, that Pakistani society is fundamentally hostile towards the west is largely hot air from Pakistan's military establishment. The Pakistani people share some of the rather abstract grievances that Muslim populations across the globe harbour. However, radicalism and militancy are not necessarily ingrained in any Muslim society, including Pakistan's.</p> <p>And if Afghanistan's experience is anything to go by, strong leadership and a true commitment to the security and wellbeing of the people of Pakistan will help the United States to find a staunch ally in the task of ridding the region of the cancer of terrorism. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Jawed Ludin is Afghanistan's Ambassador in Oslo <a href=\"mailto:jawed.ludin@afghanistanembassy.no\">jawed.ludin@afghanistanembassy.no</a></p>",
  "<p>According to a \"senior government source\", that ubiquitous character with the ear of journalists and a convenient lack of fingerprints, care services minister Ivan Lewis needs to shut his trap. \"If he can't concentrate on his day job,\" the source apparently told lobby reporters last week, \"he'll soon find himself without one.\"</p> <p>There was a time when you could be pretty sure that \"senior government source\" meant the prime minister's spokesman. These days, it seems to be a flag of convenience for anybody above the pay grade of press officer in a middling Whitehall department. In this instance, however, we can probably take it that HMS Lewis's bows have been well and truly fired across by guns not unadjacent to 10 Downing Street.</p> <p>The cause of this salvo? An article Lewis wrote in a Sunday newspaper, talking of \"10p-tax-type mistakes\" and saying that, if necessary, serious consideration should be given to asking higher earners to pay more tax. \"We can still win the next election,\" he wrote, \"but only if we are clear about the nature of the challenges and emerge with solutions that are sufficiently bold to cut through the cynicism of an angry and disappointed electorate.\"</p> <p>You can see why the No 10 crockery may have been at risk. And Lewis has form: in March, he warned that Labour was losing touch with voters; in May, he said the government owed the electorate an apology. At that point, even before the latest indiscretion, one political diarist was quipping: \"Anybody call a taxi for Ivan Lewis?\"</p> <p>There may or may not be a reshuffle in the coming weeks as part of Gordon Brown's fightback. Lewis may or may not pay the price for his outspokenness as part of such a reshuffle. But either way he is living exceedingly dangerously: even if he survives, it's hard to imagine he'll ever be Mr Popular around Team Brown.</p> <p>Why does this matter? It matters because: a) Lewis's role is of critical importance, way beyond the absurdly low status of his job title as undersecretary of state; and b) as it happens, and by common consent, he is rather good at it.</p> <p>Save for a few years earlier in this government, responsibility for social care has always been left with a junior minister. Lewis, with a background in voluntary-sector care provision, is widely held to have been Labour's best performer in the job and to be at least on par with the most favourably remembered Tories, John Bowis (1993-96) and Sir George Young (1979-81). He is certainly popular with the social care troops: \"He can talk their language and actually get ahead of them,\" says one close observer, not a senior government source. \"There are some who never caught up with the language at all.\"</p> <p>Popularity may not be all - and may even be a negative in a minister judged to be \"going native\" - but it matters hugely when the individual is spearheading not only the drive to personalise public services, where social care is blazing a trail, but also the public consultation on reform of the care and support system, described by Brown as nothing less than \"a debate that will affect every family and shape the kind of society in which we live\".</p> <p>It would be entirely understandable if Lewis, at health since 2006 but a minister since 2001, was a tad cheesed off that he was batting for the government on these two vital fronts while still ranked only a junior. So the solution seems obvious: upgrade the role to minister of state and give social care and Lewis the status they both deserve. It might not shut him up, in fact it almost certainly wouldn't, but it would make the day job worth concentrating on that bit more.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> David Brindle is the Guardian's public services editor.</p>",
  "<p>\"Sometimes,\" says Helen Marriage, \"I feel as if we are structural engineers, not theatre producers.\" Marriage, along with Nicky Webb, is the co-founder of independent producing company Artichoke. \"We've got 20 cranes on hire, from small ones to 300 tonnes,\" she adds, as she outlines their latest project. \"We're going to use miles of unused shipyard for rehearsals in Liverpool, and we're organising the closure of the Mersey tunnel. Then there's the sound, light, water, snow, wind and flame elements to get right. The only thing we can't control is the weather. But it won't rain.\"</p> <p>Marriage and Webb are miracle workers. They may not be able to turn water into wine, but they can turn a firm \"no\" into a resounding \"yes\". They have already proved that they can bring joy and wonder to a million people - with a giant, trunk-waving, mechanical elephant. The two spent five years and raised \u00a31.3m to bring Royal de Luxe's extraordinary theatrical spectacle, The Sultan's Elephant, to London in May 2006. Those who saw it will never forget it. </p> <p>They made it happen despite the Metropolitan police, who postponed the procession in the wake of the London bombings of July 2005 because they could no longer guarantee the event's safety. They made it happen despite the bureaucrats, who said they couldn't close the streets and reroute buses for three days just for art, just for an elephant to wander the Royal Parks spraying water from its trunk in the direction of Buckingham Palace. The British public, the bureaucrats said, liked their theatre safely tucked out of sight, indoors, and wouldn't be interested in turning out to see a time-travelling sultan atop his magnificent beast. </p> <p>In the end, all the doubters were proved wrong. On a Friday afternoon, I stood in the May sunshine and watched as normally sedate Londoners stood open-mouthed, hands held high as they pointed cameras. By Sunday, when the girl of the Sultan's dreams (another astonishing marionette) took off in a rocket, the crowd had swelled to a million giddy, happy people. It was a transformative moment. Police officers were dancing. Every footfall of the 40-tonne elephant - operated by 10 or more puppeteers - was a reminder of the revolution taking place in British theatre. Those reverberations are still with us, evident in theatres' growing willingness to embrace the fact their art form is about more than just plays. </p> <p>Next week, Marriage and Webb are hoping to deliver another miracle when they bring French company La Machine to Liverpool with a brand new show as part of the city's Capital of Culture celebrations. From a central tower block, another mechanical creature - this one 50ft high - will emerge and take to the streets for three days, bringing traffic to a standstill. The nature of the creature is a secret, but one thing is certain: it's not an elephant.</p> <p>\"We couldn't go down that route again,\" says Marriage. \"After The Sultan's Elephant, we were inundated with calls from people who said, 'We want one of those.' We became known as 'those elephant women'. But we didn't want to repeat ourselves. Besides, Royal de Luxe were so fed up with being invited all over the world to perform The Sultan's Elephant, they just destroyed it.\"</p> <p>Is creating a theatre event on this scale a piece of cake second time around? Marriage and Webb laugh. \"It is and it isn't,\" says Webb. \"The fundamental difference is that Liverpool has commissioned this and really wants it, whereas London didn't know it wanted the Elephant until we came along.

  "<p>Drug gangs are increasingly smuggling cocaine on to the streets of Britain using new routes through west Africa, a senior intelligence officer warns today.</p> <p>Latin American cartels are developing the route into Europe after a crackdown on transatlantic shipments, prompting the British agency that fights organised crime to expand the number of field officers it stations in countries such as Ghana to try to disrupt the trade. According to UN estimates, more than a quarter of the cocaine used by Europeans is now smuggled in through Africa.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336986254\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Society/Pix/pictures/2007/10/25/CP.jpg\" alt=\"Cocaine\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cocaine is being brought into Britain via west Africa</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In a rare interview, Rob Wainwright, international director of the Serious and Organised Crime Agency (Soca), told the Guardian: \"An increasing trend is bringing cocaine by aircraft instead of by boat into west Africa. Then it is taken on by land or ship to Europe, across some dangerous and difficult terrain.\"</p> <p>Soca's response comes amid concern that law enforcement initiatives are failing to stem the flow of drugs into Britain. Wainwright said Colombian cartels were exploiting countries recovering from conflict in the area to transport drugs to the European mainland.</p> <p>He said law enforcement activities aimed at large vessels crossing the Atlantic may have forced drug barons to switch tactics. The ability of Latin American gangs to change smuggling routes was \"a symbol of the globalisation of the problem\". \"We are forcing criminals to raise their risk factors by turning up the heat and forcing them out of their comfort zones,\" he said. Soca was developing new links with west African countries to combat the trend, including the deployment of three new field officers. At present, there is one liaison officer in the region.</p> <p>\"It's too early to tell how much [cocaine] is arriving but it is not a small amount,\" Wainwright said. \"It is something to be worried about.\" He said perhaps one drug consignment a month was arriving in west Africa from Latin America.</p> <p>Three British teenage girls have been jailed for smuggling cocaine via Africa. In May, Carly Plunkett, 19, was jailed for five and a half years after being stopped at Gatwick on her way back from the Gambia. She had \u00a3250,000 of cocaine in her suitcase. </p> <p>Two north London teenagers, Yasemin Vatansever and Yetunde Diya, served a year in jail in Ghana after they were caught at Accra's Kotoka airport last July carrying laptop bags containing cocaine worth \u00a3300,000. Customs officials believe the same gang was behind all three cases, the Guardian has learned.</p> <p>In another operation last month, in which Soca was involved, six people were arrested in Fortaleza, Brazil, in connection with the shipment of 840kg (1,852lb) of cocaine intercepted off the coast of Ghana. Police seized 700kg of cocaine at Sierra Leone's main airport last month, while another big seizure was made recently in Guinea-Bissau.</p> <p><br>One problem Soca faces is corruption among authorities and police forces in west Africa. Soca said: \"Corruption has always been in the back of our minds in difficult operating environments such as Africa. It is a challenge to find partners who we can trust, but we are making headway.\"</p> <p>The UN has highlighted the west African drugs trade as a growing problem. Herv\u00e9 Ludovic de Lys, of the UN office for the co-ordination of humanitarian affairs, estimated that more than a quarter of the cocaine Europeans consume reaches them through west Africa. Although the exact size of west Africa's drugs trade is unknown, De Lys said an estimated 40 tonnes of Latin American cocaine passes through west Africa each year, with an estimated value of around \u00a3907m. He said the trade could fuel violence, destabilising countries that were recovering from conflict, such as Sierra Leone, Liberia and Ivory Coast.</p> <p>A UK Drug Policy Commission report released last month said that law enforcement was failing to impede the supply of drugs into Britain, considered one of the world's most lucrative markets.</p> <p>\"It appears that additional enforcement efforts have had little adverse effect on the availability of illicit drugs in the UK,\" the report said. \"Since 2000, average street prices in the UK have fallen consistently for heroin, cocaine, ecstasy and cannabis.\" </p> <p>The report also provided further evidence that cocaine, once considered a drug for the rich, is being sold in an adulterated form as a cheap drug targeted at young people.</p> <p>\"There is some evidence to suggest that a two-tier market for powder cocaine has emerged in the UK during recent years at both wholesale and street levels. These data suggest that there is now an expanding market for cheaper, heavily adulterated cocaine among young people and students, for example, and that higher purity cocaine is aimed at more affluent buyers.\"</p> <p>The average street price for cocaine has fallen from \u00a365 a gram in 2000, to between \u00a330 and \u00a350 - depending on the purity of the powder - in 2007, the report said.</p> <p>Harry Shapiro, of Drugscope, an independent centre of information on drugs, said: \"Over the past 10 years, cocaine has become increasingly available in the UK. While it still retains its glamour image, prices have fallen and put the drug within the reach of a wide range of people for whom cocaine has become an unremarkable part of their lifestyle. </p> <p>\"It seems as if this process began with the break-up of the large cocaine cartels in Colombia during the early 1990s, resulting in the development of several smaller cartels who needed to find new outlets beyond the traditional US market.\"</p>",
  "<p>When the occupants of the 491 Gallery in Leytonstone, east London, play squatters' Monopoly, a variation on the real game, they declare that the place they've lived in for the last seven years is the equivalent to Mayfair on the board game. \"This is by far the best squat I've ever lived in,\" says Sy, an artist. </p> <p>With its white-walled gallery space, airy rooms and landscaped garden it's easy to see why he and his six housemates find the place so appealing.

They found human faeces, drug paraphernalia, and swastikas daubed on the walls, along with a collection of bags and purses thrown into the backyard by muggers who dumped them there after emptying them. They set about clearing up the mounds of rubble outside, cleaned and painted the inside and, once the repairs were complete, threw open the doors and invited the local community to use the space for artistic and environmental endeavours. </p> <p>Local artists as well as those from further afield can exhibit art in the gallery. A Robin Hood principle is applied, and those who have financial means pay a modest fee that subsidises those who cannot afford to pay to display.</p> <p>TfL has allowed the squatters to stay for more than seven years, although a spokesman says: \"We have sought to formalise the relationship with the squatters but it hasn't happened. We are looking at long-term plans for the building.\" </p> <p>The squatters, however, believe that TfL has quietly given its blessing to their usage of the building, which would otherwise lie empty or once again be taken over by chaotic drug users or vandals.</p> <p>Formal or informal caretaking arrangements such as this occur in only a minority of squatting cases, although those who practise what they describe as \"community-based squatting\" are often keen to seek out such agreements. </p> <p><strong>Community resource</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336975406\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Society/Pix/pictures/2008/08/26/Spikec220x130.jpg\" alt=\"A bread oven at the Spike project in Peckham, south London, a squat that has been turned into a community resource providing a wellbeing clinic, yoga, and massage.

Those who occupy buildings and turn them into community resources such as the 491 Gallery describe their actions as \"positive squatting\".</p> <p>According to Phoenix, a veteran squatter and part of an environmental group called the Circle Community, they are on the increase. He is now on his third caretaker agreement in a squatted property. His advice to others who want to reach an accommodation with a landlord who suddenly finds his or her property taken over is to keep communicating in the early days and weeks after moving in.</p> <p>\"When we squat a building we wait for the landlords to contact us, but once they have we keep calling them and writing to them,\" says Phoenix. \"Many landlords have a stereotypical view of squatters but if you can give them a letter laying out the advantages to them of a caretaking deal - no expensive court costs for eviction and security and repairs carried out for no cost - you might get somewhere.\"</p> <p>Getting a landlord to read a letter from squatters is the first step, and setting up a meeting an important second step. \"And if you can get the landlord to come to the premises, sit down with you and have something to eat and a cup of tea then your chances of securing a deal increase dramatically,\" says Phoenix.</p> <p>In September 2006, Phoenix was one of a group of squatters who occupied a large house in a desirable part of north London. Similar homes in the road were at the time selling for more than \u00a36m. The squatters negotiated a groundbreaking licence-to-occupy agreement with Circle 33 Housing Trust, the organisation planning to redevelop it as social housing.</p> <p>A spokesman for the trust described the arrangement as \"a creative and pragmatic response to the circumstances ... it allows for the building to be secured while planning for its future is still under way.\"</p> <p>Phoenix points out: \"It can cost a landlord \u00a35,000 a week to have 24-hour security for an empty building. Deals like this can save them money and recycle space. We do it [recycling] with cans, paper and glass, why not buildings.\" </p> <p>He and his fellow squatters focus on offering a range of projects to the local community. \"Young people need a place to go to keep them off the streets. We offer skateboarding and DJ and rapping workshops.\"</p> <p>He admits, though, that some landlords are more intransigent than others. \"We once squatted a Ministry of Defence property. They were very efficient and took us to court to evict us pretty quickly.\"</p> <p>The Empty Homes Agency, which campaigns for the estimated 840,0000 empty buildings in the UK to be brought back into use, says using buildings is more important than ever in a period of economic downturn. \"If a property is left empty it gets damaged,\" says chief executive David Ireland. \"We are hearing a lot about thefts of copper piping. If pipe work is torn out it costs a lot to replace it, so keeping properties occupied is really important.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336975407\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Society/Pix/pictures/2008/08/26/Spike220x310.jpg\" alt=\"The Spike project in Peckham, south London, a squat that has been turned into a community resource providing a wellbeing clinic, yoga, and massage.

They have lived there for more than a decade but have now been told they must leave or find \u00a3450,000 to buy the building.</p> <p>When they arrived, the squatters brought in diggers to clear huge mounds of rubbish in the yard. They converted the area into a lush garden growing flowers, fruits and vegetables. A range of services are on offer such as a wellbeing clinic, yoga, massage and reiki. Local musicians can also rent studio space cheaply.</p> <p>The Spike scheme gets its name from its past use as a doss-house or \"spike\". These operated as \"shelters of last resort\" - George Orwell stayed in spikes in the 1930s. The building in Peckham served homeless and jobless people and the urban poor for more than a century and was used by more than a million people until 1985. In the 1990s, it was used by an arts and crafts project for kids, which vacated the premises in 1998 when it lost its funding. Soon after, the current occupiers moved in.</p> <p>The council, after originally trying to launch eviction proceedings, offered the occupants a lease and a peppercorn rent at the doors of the court. </p> <p><strong>Irreversible loss</strong></p> <p>\"This place is a central part of the community,\" says Donna, one of the squatters who has spent years transforming the place from a derelict dump into a pleasant community centre. \"When people are in trouble or have something to celebrate they can come here. There's a real difference between the council providing a top-down space and letting local people take on a space and create something. So much love has gone into building this place up. The loss of it would be irreversible,\" </p> <p>For Sy in east London, allowing creativity to flourish without financial constraints is key to the success of the squat where he lives and works. \"We have a no violence rule here and don't allow the use of class A drugs. We want this to be a safe place for children and families. For the first two years, it was like having Glastonbury in your house every day, but over the seven years we have worked 80-hour weeks to clean the space up and make it what it is today. We're proud to be able to give artistic spaces to people who need time to make beautiful things.\"</p>",
  "<p>Overweight people will today be told there are \"no excuses\" for being obese as the Conservative party launches a new \"responsibility\" deal on public health.</p> <p>The shadow health secretary, Andrew Lansley, will use a speech to the thinktank Reform, entitled No Excuses, No Nannying, to set out proposals on how the government and business can work together to address problems caused by poor diet, alcohol abuse and lack of exercise.</p> <p>\"Tell people that biology and the environment cause obesity and they are offered the one thing we have to avoid: an excuse,\" he will say. </p> <p>\"As it is, people who see more fat people around them may themselves be more likely to gain weight. Young people who think many of their friends binge-drink are likely to do so themselves. Girls who think their peers engage in early sex are more likely to do so themselves. </p> <p>\"Peer pressure and social norms are powerful influences on behaviour and they are classic excuses.\"</p> <p>Vowing to \"take away the excuses\", Lansley will unveil proposals for the party's second \"responsibility\" deal with business.</p> <p>He will ask a new working group to consider: </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> supporting EU-wide proposals for mandatory front-of-pack food labelling </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> asking the food industry to reduce portion sizes </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> a clampdown on food advertising </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> using role models and positive peer pressure to promote healthy living </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> local campaigns to promote sport, exercise and healthy lifestyles. </p> <p>He will float the idea of incentives for small businesses to improve the health of employees. \"We will take action to ensure people have the opportunities, information and incentives towards healthy living,\" Lansley will say.</p> <p>The speech comes after the Tory leader, David Cameron, said last month that the poor, obese and lazy spent too much time blaming social problems for their own shortcomings.</p> <p>Insisting a Conservative government would not be a \"nannying\" state, Lansley will deny that the proposals are \"about telling people what to do\".</p> <p>\"Tackling the environment should not be a licence to lecture people, because they have no excuse not to exercise, or eat their fruit and vegetables. Nannying - at least among adults - is likely to be counterproductive. Providing information is empowering, lecturing people is not. So, no excuses, no nannying.\"</p> <p>For teenagers, the party plans to deploy role models and social marketing techniques, not just to warn about the harm of \"risky behaviour\", but to offer \"positive empowerment they can achieve by choosing healthy living\".</p> <p>\"We must not constantly talk about tackling obesity and warning people about the negative consequences of obesity. Instead we must be positive - positive about the fun and benefits to be had from healthy living, trying to get rid of people's excuses for being obese by tackling the issue in a positive way.\"</p> <p>The responsibility deal on public health follows a similar initiative on producer waste announced earlier this year. The scheme is designed to encourage businesses to act in a socially responsible way and tackle issues that cannot be solved by regulation and legislation alone.</p> <p>However, business leaders criticised the scheme, saying it would cause confusion. The CBI's director general, Richard Lambert, said at the time: \"The proper role of government is to create certainty in the market and maintain a clear distinction between compulsory regulation and voluntary action. Where necessary, the government should regulate clearly and enforce the regulations strongly.</p> <p>\"There is a risk that responsibility deals would confuse this issue, by being almost a form of regulation by proxy, and would lack credibility.\"</p> <h2>A growing problem</h2> <p>Weight problems are estimated to cost the NHS and the wider economy as much as \u00a316bn a year, a figure that is expected to rise to \u00a350bn by the middle of the century. Nearly a quarter of men and women in England are obese, according to the Department of Health. Up to 18% cent of two- to 15-year-olds are described as obese and a further 14% as overweight. A government report last year suggested that if current eating habits and exercise trends persist, nearly 60% of men and 50% of women will be obese by 2050. A further 35% of adults will fall into the overweight category. The severely obese are likely to die on average 11 years earlier than someone with a healthy weight. <br><strong>Owen Bowcott</strong></p>",
  "<p>Israel has nearly doubled the number of homes under construction in Jewish settlements in the West Bank this year despite continuing negotiations with the Palestinians for a peace agreement, according to a new report published yesterday.</p> <p>Peace Now, an Israeli organisation, said the housing ministry had begun work on 433 new housing units between January and May this year, compared with 240 in the same period last year. Its findings were based on figures from Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics.</p> <p>In total, the group said more than 1,000 new buildings, representing 2,600 housing units, were under construction in settlements, with 55% of them east of the vast concrete and steel barrier Israel has built in and along the West Bank.</p> <p>The US secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, who arrived in Israel on Monday for another round of talks with Israeli and Palestinian leaders, again criticised settlement activity. Under the Washington-backed road map, Israel is to freeze all construction in the settlements. Settlements on occupied land are illegal under international law. \"I have said it to my Israeli counterparts, that I don't think that settlement activity is helpful,\" Rice said.</p> <p>Israeli and Palestinian leaders have so far failed to reach any agreement despite regular talks, which began with the newly relaunched peace process in Annapolis, US, last November.</p> <p>Tzipi Livni, the Israeli foreign minister, said, at a joint press conference with Rice yesterday, that the peace process would \"not be affected\" by settlement activity. </p> <p>\"The role of the leaders is to try to find a way to live in peace in the future and not to let any kind of noises that relate to the situation on the ground these days to enter the negotiation room,\" said Livni. </p> <p>\"But at the end of the day the Israeli government's policy is not to expand settlements, not to build new settlements and not to confiscate Palestinian land.\"</p> <p>She added that settlement activity had \"reduced in the most dramatic way\", particularly east of the barrier.</p>",
  "<p>Richard Simpson's daily challenge is to persuade foremen on building sites to separate waste. The former architect is co-founder of the Brighton &amp; Hove Wood Recycling Project, which has recycled nearly 6,000 tonnes of timber since it opened in 1998. All would otherwise have been buried or chipped.</p> <p>The initiative was one of the first in Britain to take waste wood from building sites to be reused. From humble beginnings when he and a colleague lugged wood across town in a clapped-out camper van, the project has since become a model for community recycling. </p> <p>\"To building firms we were just a bunch of hippies,\" says Simpson. \"But we were the first in the country to go to commercial building sites. The trick is to win over the foreman.\" And to have a steady stream of volunteers and staff, who between them have collected lab tables from Roedean school, stage sets, and timber from Brighton pier and English Heritage sites. </p> <p>Grassroots projects such as this are playing an underrated but important role in diverting materials produced by construction from landfill. Simpson provides timber to customers as diverse as the Chelsea Flower Show, students and home improvers. </p> <p>The project has become a model for community recycling nationwide. Simpson's co-founder, Richard Mehmed, has gone on to help establish 21 wood recycling projects in Cambridge, east London, Glasgow, Llandudno and Manchester, among others, using Brighton as a template. </p> <p>These kinds of projects are making an impact but the task is herculean. Last week, the House of Lords science committee reported that householders account for 9% of the UK's waste annually. The construction industry, by contrast, generates 90m tonnes of waste a year, producing about 32% of the UK's total waste. Up to a third of construction materials end up in landfill and nearly 13% of materials delivered to building sites never get used. </p> <p>The Lords called for councils to prioritise reducing waste from businesses, and argued that companies should be made responsible for the waste associated with their products. \"We would like to see the VAT regime reformed so that products that have a long life-cycle, or can be easily and cheaply repaired rather than replaced, are made economically more attractive,\" said Lord O'Neill, who chaired the waste reduction sub-committee.</p> <p>The threat of rising landfill tax, set to reach \u00a348 per tonne by 2011, will certainly force construction companies to take waste seriously. \"It can be difficult to persuade people of the moral argument behind recycling [but] when a business realises that it will affect them financially, they are likely to respond,\" says Zoe Le Grand, project manager at industry body Constructing Excellence. \"Legislation is getting tighter. If they want to prepare their business for the future, they should get arrangements in place for recycling as soon as possible.\" </p> <p>Some contractors have started to act. Taylor Woodrow ran a pilot plasterboard recycling scheme in 2005 resulting in recycling rates of 72% from its housebuilding programmes. And like many construction companies, Persimmon Homes' Anglia branch segregates waste materials into separate skips on site, with 300 tonnes of recyclate distributed monthly to metal, plastics and woodchip companies.</p> <p>Skanska, one of the contractors for the \u00a31bn Bart's and the Royal London hospitals' redevelopment, has during the project reached recycling rates of 99.6% - 50,000 tonnes. \"A waste volume is agreed before we sign the contract,\" explains James MacMillan, the programme's environment manager. \"If the trade contractor goes over that, they pay for the waste. The key is to prevent waste from coming to site in the first place, [by] reducing packaging and working with trade contractors. Segregation and waste management should be the last link in the chain.\"</p> <p>Reuse of recyclate brought in from elsewhere is becoming more common. BAA's Terminal 5 construction at Heathrow reused more than 80,000 tonnes of materials. Crushed glass from local recycling banks was used to make site roads and around 30% of the concrete mix used for buildings, taxiways and aircraft stands was from a power generation byproduct, pulverised fuel ash. </p> <p>For smaller building firms that do not have the resources to employ an environment manager, help is at hand. Guidance has emerged from the Waste and Resources Action Programme (Wrap) and the Environment Agency's NetRegs website. </p> <p>The government, it seems, has woken up to the construction waste problem. Last April, the Environment Agency mandated site waste management plans for construction projects in England worth more than \u00a3300,000, in which, from the pre-construction stage onwards, firms must declare waste materials and how they will be disposed of. The agency says this will cut 100m tonnes of waste annually. </p> <p>Last June, the Strategic Forum for Construction, an industry-cum-government body, launched the strategy for sustainable construction, declaring aims for 50% reduction of construction, demolition and excavation waste to landfill by 2012 compared with this year. In May, the Construction Resources and Waste Roadmap was published by a public-private consortium, proposing 10 actions. The report was funded by a body of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.</p> <p>But the outlook for agencies created by the government to encourage sustainable practice among business is beginning to look gloomy. In the next tax year, the government plans to cut funding for environmental advisory agency Envirowise by more than 50%, and the Market Transformation Programme, National Industrial Symbiosis Programme and Wrap will all see their budgets slashed, something the waste reduction sub-committee expressed \"extreme disappointment\" over.</p>",

  "<p>I have to declare a very obvious interest in this story, right from the start. Kings Place in London just happens to be the new home, from the end of this year, of the Guardian Media Group. So you might well expect me to write nice things about it. But lucky us, I have to say. </p> <p>Kings Place is a building in a number of movements. Sited on the Regent's Canal, a few minutes' walk from King's Cross station, it is at once a commercial office block, a media HQ, home to two art galleries - and a wholly unexpected musical box. Indeed, the emotional heart and architectural pivot of the building is not its bright and airy central atrium, flanked with cafes and bars, but the concert hall below it. Where else in Britain will you find a commercial building given over as much to the arts as to business and rents? Where else will you find a privately funded concert hall, designed by Jeremy Dixon and Ed Jones, architects of the very public and handsomely remodelled Royal Opera House and National Portrait Gallery?</p> <p>You know this building is different even as you approach it. Why? Because the facade is a theatrical glass curtain rippling along the length of the building that appears to change shape as you walk beneath it. Its wave-like form, composed of three layers of curved glass, is not gratuitous: designed to mitigate the effects of dazzle and heat, it also happens to resemble a hi-tech version of a stage curtain. It's a nice conceit. You can imagine yourself sweeping open the curtain and strutting on to the stage-like space of the building's central atrium. The glass curtain was made in Venice and, as you walk through the building and out the other side, you find yourself faced with a canal basin and, if not gondolas, then plenty of barges. It's a place of peace, space, light, water and ducks, quite a surprise after the cacophony of the main road.</p> <p>The idea of Kings Place is very much that of its developer, Peter Millican, who just happens to have a passion for art and music. Millican wanted to shape a building that, while paying its way, would also allow him to indulge these loves. Two orchestras - the London Sinfonietta and the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment - have already moved in at peppercorn rents. </p> <p>When I toured the building last week, with Millican and Dixon, the composer Colin Matthews was making a recording of nearly 100 newly commissioned songs to be played at Kings Place next spring. The building's public launch, on October 1, will be marked by a five-day festival of music, film, sculpture, paintings, food and drink.</p> <p>The 450-seat concert hall is truly remarkable, one of the most handsome and intriguing new venues in central London. A shoebox auditorium, it is by necessity sealed and windowless to keep the relentless roar of King's Cross at bay. But it nevertheless manages to avoid feeling claustrophobic. Lined throughout in veneer garnered from a single, 500-year-old Black Forest oak, it has all the elegance and grandeur of a Greek temple.</p> <p>The upper level is enclosed by a geometric timber frame, with each wooden upright appearing to represent a classical column. The coffered ceiling adds to the neoclassical effect, though this pattern is the consequence, Dixon says, of acoustic rather than architectural needs. The adjustable curtains between the columns are there to control reverberation, but when these are lit a Mediterranean late-evening blue, the impression is of sitting inside a classical pavilion with the sky and music all around. A smaller, 200-seat room for experimental music and other performances, with a window looking into the building's central atrium, complements the main concert hall.</p> <p>What about the offices? Designed for around 3,000 people, these are gathered in the three main elements of the seven-storey building: two oblong ranges and one cylindrical tower connected by internal glazed bridges. The business floors are brimming with daylight and offer fine views of central London, over St Pancras station and towards the Thames. Other views are down into the atrium or on to the barges. Network Rail has taken space here, as have the Guardian and Observer. The common spaces - lobbies, lifts, lavatories - are floored in marble and walled with timber.</p> <p>Newspapers have changed radically since the days of the old Fleet Street headquarters. Printing presses no longer rumble and roll beneath journalists' feet. The clickety-clack of typewriters has long gone. But even in an age of radical change, a newspaper remains a public institution as well as a commercial enterprise. In Kings Place, Guardian and Observer journalists will be working in a building designed from the outset to provide both private offices and public spaces. The idea of being able to cure one of those mental blanks caused by staring too long at a computer screen with a shot of Schubert or a dose of Delius has a charm of its own.</p> <p>Today's newspapers have become part of a multimedia world. The Guardian and Observer are active online as well as in print. They produce films and radio programmes. They run conferences. They produce news, comment and features 24 hours a day, seven days a week and broadcast worldwide. So their offices have had to change along with the ways they work. Journalists and technologies of all kinds will be thrown together. There will be places for staff to meet informally, spaces for them to hide away when they need to think, and an overall sense of interconnectedness. The big idea is that journalists will be able to work across what management likes to call \"platforms\". In practice, this means being able to write a story, update it at appropriate intervals, publish it in print and online, and broadcast it, too. Multimedia editing suites will keep journalists hard pressed. Just as well, perhaps, that soothing or stimulating music will be more or less on tap downstairs.</p> <p>Given that Kings Place is meant to embody Guardian values, you would expect the building to be environmentally sound. The indications are that Kings Place will use half the energy of a conventional office block. Enormous quantities of cool air flowing through the building naturally - a trick known to many ancient cultures - will reduce the need for air conditioning. The triple-layered, west-facing glass screen will help to keep the enormous heat generated by the setting sun at bay. And, delightfully, a partial \"green roof\" - the part not given over to essential building machinery - will be home to birds and bats; bird and bat boxes are being installed even as the multimedia editing suites are inserted in the offices below. </p> <p>Compared with new offices such as the 52-storey, Renzo Piano-designed New York Times building in New York, Kings Place is a modest creation. The London block has been designed to blend in with the existing streetscape and the new designs that will flank it soon enough as the vast King's Cross redevelopment scheme rises above railway tracks, crinkly Victorian walls and gas-holders. Kings Place has been shaped to be a player on a big and sprawling London stage, not to stand out like some bold new symbol of the city. It is a handsome commercial building, but its sorcery, open to all, is tucked inside its Jura limestone-clad and Venetian glass-cloaked walls.</p> <p>With luck, it might just set the tone for a new generation of offices in British cities. It is certainly high time developers began to nurture buildings that, while they might not always be pitch perfect, have more to offer than the single tone of so many ruthlessly commercial designs. It will also change the working lives of hundreds of journalists and others working in the media. How will these changes pan out? I can only say, in that good old-fashioned Fleet Street cliche, watch this space.</p>",
  "<p>Separated but living together (SBLT) may not have the same ring to it as GSoH, but anyone scouring the lonely hearts columns may as well get used to the fact that in these lean times, increasing numbers of divorcing couples are having to stay under the same roof. The slowdown in the property market means that couples often cannot sell their house, even after their divorce has gone through the courts, while tightened lending restrictions mean it can be nearly impossible to secure a mortgage to enable one party to buy the other's share of the property or to enable one party to buy a separate property. For many couples, including middle-class professionals, the credit crunch means they cannot even afford the divorce itself.</p> <p>\"When I broke up with my husband last summer, we decided to sell the house to split the equity and pay for the divorce,\" says Elizabeth Western, 35, who lives in Hampshire and had been with her husband for 10 years. \"But despite dropping the price twice, we still haven't sold. So we're stuck in a situation where we're still not divorced and, although we try to maintain a reasonable front with each other in front of our six-year-old daughter, underneath it's very strained and there have been times when she has seen things she shouldn't have. The emotional impact is massive and sometimes I feel like tearing my hair out. My only saving grace is that since I've started telling people about it, I've realised how common it is.\"</p> <p>It's not just marriage break-ups that are being affected by a looming recession. Relationships themselves are feeling the sting. As living costs rise, as businesses go into receivership, as jobs are axed and as debts escalate, there is a price being paid behind the bedroom door. Money worries can be as toxic to a relationship as adultery, say divorce lawyers who are seeing the evidence for themselves. Margaret Hatwood, an associate in the family department of law firm Thomas Eggar, reports that \"some family law firms have never been busier\". In many cases, these lawyers are having to break the unwelcome news of a double whammy: not only has financial pressure ruined their clients' marriage, but it may wreck their chances of a clean break, too.</p> <p>Statistics confirm that more of us separate from our partners in times of financial strain. During the recession of 1990-94, divorce rates rose sharply from 153,386 to 165,018, only to fall back again as Labour came into office and the economy improved. We get married less, too, and our sex drive drops. The population fell sharply in 1976, following the recession of 1974 and its aftermath. </p> <p>Psychologist Kim Stephenson believes that while in some cases financial hardship exposes unwelcome truths about the nature of the relationship, other cases reveal just how significant financial goals are to a relationship. \"What the little research out there does tell us is that people often have unspoken goals about money that they don't share, even with each other,\" he says. \"In times of economic boom, they just get on with it, but in times of uncertainty, resentment can kick in. 'Well, if you hadn't insisted on having this house or bought your 17th pair of shoes, we wouldn't be in this situation.' 'Oh, and I suppose your top-of-the-range satnav has nothing to do with us heading for debt?' And so on.\"</p> <p>There is evidence that people with strong relationships tend to pull together in times of adversity, says Stephenson, but where there are potential cracks, a credit crunch may be the last straw. Marriage support organisation Marriage Care reports that finance is a factor for 60% of couples who approach them.</p> <p>Unemployment causes the most break-ups. One study by the Tavistock Institute of Marital Studies found that the loss of a job includes the loss of the psychological meaning that the job held, not only for the individual but for the couple.</p> <p>In the US, where financial woes have been going on longer, divorce is booming. Raoul Felder, a New York lawyer who specialises in the divorces of the super-wealthy, recently disclosed that business had rocketed 40% in the past year and that he had not seen such a big jump in his caseload since 1980. </p> <p>Gary O Todd, a divorce lawyer in Boston, also says that the troubled economy has boosted his client base: \"Money is one of the primary reasons or causes of a divorce, and when you have a downward economy, that exacerbates the financial troubles and tensions in marriage.\" </p> <p>However, John G DiPiano, another Boston-based lawyer, confirms that because of the collapse in the housing market, a worrying number of his clients cannot sell the marital home, meaning that the estranged couple has to live there indefinitely. For the first time in his career, he says, he is facing the problem of negative equity. \"We're in a situation where creative problem-solving is at an absolute premium in terms of choosing a divorce attorney,\" he says. </p> <p>One solution he points to is a \"short sale\", in which the house is sold at a loss and both parties split the debt. Another involves one party taking on the responsibility - and risk - of the house as well as any future profits, although this assumes that the other can afford another property. </p> <p>Back in the UK, where negative equity is not on the same scale - at least for now - divorcing couples living in close quarters are mostly just hoping they will sell up soon, though some are resigned to sitting out the storm, having worked out that the only way to make the sale of the family home fund two more homes (even modest ones) is to wait until the economy picks up again. \"In a time of declining property values, you do get cases where neither party wants to resolve matters until values of property have ceased falling,\" says Hatwood, who remembers a couple from the last recession who did not actually leave their home. \"They simply subdivided their house into properties so the wife and children effectively occupied two-thirds and the husband one third.\"</p> <p>Another couple hung on in there for so long that they wound up ditching their separation plans altogether. As part of their efforts to introduce compromise into their strained lifestyles, says Hatwood, they renewed a respect for one another that they thought had long disappeared.</p> <p>She says that, with purse strings tightened, many couples are struggling to pay for the divorce itself, with many turning to mediation (where a third party provides a structured conversation in which to negotiate finances) or collaborative law (the same thing but with lawyers). Bargain hunters are also going online. Such is the growth of couples seeking a divorce through Divorce Online - 48% in the past six months - that they've had to take on new staff and larger premises. The cost of using a solicitor, which averages \u00a3900 for a straightforward divorce (and a great deal more for anything more complicated), means that the fees for Divorce Online, which start at \u00a365 for an uncontested divorce, make for happier reading - although all couples have to pay \u00a3340 for court fees. Of the couples using Divorce Online, 85% say that the main factor is cost.</p> <p>Rachel Prescott, 34, and her ex-husband cut costs using <a href=\"http://quickiedivorce.com\">quickiedivorce.com</a>, but still did not have enough money for one of them to move out of the matrimonial home for a year following their decision to separate. \"My studio is in the home, so moving out wasn't an option for me, but I couldn't afford to buy him out of the mortgage right away. The problem was he couldn't afford to move out until I'd done that, so we were stuck. Thankfully, we had a spare room.\"</p> <p>Although Prescott, who lives in Hertfordshire, describes their split as amicable, the 12 months were far from easy. \"Once you make the decision to separate, you want to start your new life. It stopped me dating and I didn't feel I could socialise at home. Then there were the little things such as washing and ironing. Do you get petty and say, 'I'm not doing yours, even though it's in the basket'? Do you say, 'I'm only cooking my dinner, not yours'? I didn't feel comfortable with that, so we were still living much of our lives like a couple.\"</p> <p>In November last year - nine months after his decision to split up with his wife - Robert Wise, 39, from Swindon, took the radical step of moving in with his mother. \"I couldn't carry on living with my wife,\" he says. \"It's not that we weren't civil to each other. We have two children, aged eight and five, and were very mindful of them and still did some things with them together. But my wife went off with someone else and that was hard. The house is still on the market, despite us dropping the price by \u00a310,000 at a time. I wonder when it's ever going to end.\"</p> <p>Even the most measured people rarely point to their divorce as their finest hour behaviourally. \"I dealt with a guy who lived with his wife for a year while they waited to sell up. She'd 'left' him but he still loved her,\" says Francine Kaye, founder of <a href=\"http://thedivorcedoctor.co.uk\">thedivorcedoctor.co.uk</a>. </p> <p>\"In the end, he started doing things such as removing her food from the fridge and hiding her hair straighteners. It doesn't sound much, but imagine it all the time.\"</p> <p>As in the States, the majority of divorces in the UK is among the highest earners. Mishcon de Reya recently found that half of all City workers had seen their bonuses slashed by up to \u00a340,000, leading to more fights with their other halves, and that 79% feared that their marriages were more likely to break up during a downturn. A fifth knew one or more colleagues who were divorcing and 10% believed that their own spouse had sought legal advice.</p> <p>But, says Sharon Bennett, partner at the law firm Bross Bennett, it is the people in the middle-earning bracket who are worst affected. \"Those in council accommodation wouldn't be touched by a house sale and those at the top end still seem to be saying, 'What spending problems?' despite the credit crunch,\" she says. \"It's the middle bracket, where the primary asset is the house, who are suffering. They may well have stretched themselves for 15 or more years.\"</p> <p>Even those who are not married and do not have a mortgage are not immune. \"Despite splitting up with my boyfriend a month ago, we're having to live together until September in a rented one-bedroom apartment, where sleeping on the couch isn't even really an option for any length of time because it's a two-seater,\" says Sally Moore, 25. \"It's hideous, but at \u00a31,500 per month for a pretty standard flat in Clapham, south London, there's no way one of us can move out because the other wouldn't be able to meet the bills. Thankfully, there are nights when I'm able to stay away and sometimes he works overseas, but there are times we have to share the bed - with pillows down the middle.\"</p> <p>At least she knows it will all be over in the autumn, which is more than Sarah Marshall, 37, from Worcestershire, can say. \"My partner and I separated before Christmas, but the house hasn't sold and it's really stressful,\" she says. They had been together 11 years. \"I think the worst thing is that the children know we're separated, our families know and our friends know, but we're still here in this limbo state. A couple of days ago, the estate agent said we should drop the price again, this time by \u00a325,000. My partner says no way, but part of me feels our situation is so desperate that maybe we should just do it so that we can get a buyer and move on with our lives.\"</p> <p>Marshall can't help thinking, \"At least I'm not married,\" and she has a point. At a time when fuel and food costs are on the up - and none of us really knows how things are going to pan out - some people are finding themselves unable to be generous in divorce settlements in a way that they might have been a year ago. They are, according to lawyers, recession-proofing, especially if there are maintenance costs involved.</p> <p>There has even been a rise in the number of defended divorce cases - where people are refusing to agree to a divorce because they think they will lose out financially, says Marilyn Stowe of the Yorkshire- and Cheshire-based Stowe Family Law firm. \"If you're a wife with a low-income capacity and you're told your house has to be sold and that, because your house is worth less than you thought, you have to move into accommodation that you would never have dreamed about living in - defending the divorce is one way to put a hold on everything. The husband, on the other hand, may be keen to get divorced now because he is worth far less than he was six to 12 months ago, which means the payout to his wife is far less than it would have been,\" she says.</p> <p>Other couples are both changing their minds. Helen Marriott, a partner at Brabners Chaffe Street, says, \"I've seen clients recently where they weigh up the pros and cons and they've agreed with their partner that splitting up is actually not worth it.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Some names have been changed.</p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling are facing increasing calls for a windfall tax on energy companies - which they should ignore. A windfall tax is arbitrary, unexpected and unfair. It would penalise companies already paying large amounts of tax and planning to invest billions in Britain's infrastructure in the next 10 years. It would sour Britain's investment climate in a global race for energy and resources. While it could close a short-term funding gap and help provide assistance for fuel-poor households, its long-term impact would be counter-productive. There are better ways of raising the money.</p> <p>Proponents of a one-off measure usually cite Labour's imposition of a windfall tax on the utilities in 1997, which raised \u00a34.5bn to fund the New Deal for the unemployed. Industry squealed at the time, but paid up. The measure was in the Labour manifesto for more than a year, giving companies time to plan. Industry had also made huge gains in profitability since privatisation and was in a stronger position than it is now. </p> <p>A decade ago, Britain was a net exporter of oil and gas as North Sea output boomed. That position has reversed, and this year we look set to import 40% of our gas needs. The UK has invested less in storage capacity for gas than other countries - we have room for 10 days' peak supply compared with 60 in France and 80 in Germany, so are much more dependent on the wholesale market in winter. That market and many gas supply contracts are tied to the global oil price, which has doubled this year.</p> <p>This is why energy companies have recently raised their prices by such large amounts - 35% alone for British Gas's gas customers and 9% for electricity. The operators are trying to protect their profits as they face rising supply bills.</p> <p>While headline figures of nearly \u00a31bn in profits for Centrica, the owner of British Gas, in the first half of the year make it look as if operators are coining it from high consumer prices, the underlying picture is complex. British Gas's profit from its residential business was down 70%. The company makes a margin of 4% on household sales, which at \u00a3166m are still a sizable chunk - but not as lucrative as at first glance.</p> <p>It should be stressed that these are profit-making enterprises - they are no longer state-owned. What's more, many are based overseas and have few allegiances to Britain. If they decide not to invest here, they can go elsewhere.</p> <p>The government is in a difficult position if it wants to intervene after the way the industry was privatised in the 1980s. Competition is supposed to dictate an efficient market. This may not be a perfect situation, especially when many gas and power companies overseas remain in government hands, but it is reality and very difficult to change. </p> <p>A further drawback to a windfall tax is what to include. Where energy companies have been making a lot of money this year is in their so-called upstream operations - in the production of oil and gas which benefits from those higher global prices. North Sea operators are largely international oil companies such as Shell, BP and Exxon. Shell, for example, made a profit equivalent to almost \u00a32m an hour in the first half of the year. But these companies already pay petroleum revenue tax on those North Sea profits at a rate of 50% and need to invest more to squeeze every last drop of oil from depleting fields. Their profits come from operations all over the world, and it would be hard to draw a line round money made only in the UK.</p> <p>Like it or not, we are all dependent on billions of pounds of investment from the energy sector over the next decade. The government has put the bill on renewables investment at \u00a3100bn over 10 years, and a new generation of nuclear reactors will not come cheap. Older generators have to be closed in the next seven years because of EU environmental legislation and the first nuclear station is unlikely to come on stream before 2018. There is a looming gap in our electricity output which will have to be filled by gas- or coal-fired stations - as yet unbuilt. Renewables will pick up some of the slack, but they are expensive to build, and many are stuck in the planning process.</p> <p>Already companies are grumbling about the difficulties of building power stations in Britain where they face long planning wrangles, little state help and environmental protests. Add an arbitrary levy to those drawbacks, and the UK becomes even less attractive for international investment dollars.</p> <p>One area where the government could legitimately raise funds from the energy industry has already been suggested by the regulator, Ofgem. Power generators have this year been given a one-off gain by receiving free pollution permits for the EU's carbon-trading scheme. The government is committed to auctioning just 7% of those permits this year, but the scheme allows for 10% to be sold. An auction of the additional 3% could raise \u00a3200m.</p> <p>I don't want to sound like an apologist for an unpopular industry - and it is undeniable that less well-off households face hardship this winter. But in my view, there are better ways than a windfall tax of levying the funds - potentially from a higher top rate of tax on individuals that would also go some way towards bridging a rising inequality gap.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:deborah.hargreaves@theguardian.com\">deborah.hargreaves@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Scrap is well named. He is small, and he knows it. Behind those bright eyes, there's a growing anxiety as year 6 and 7 boys tower over him in the playground - and he's in year 11. This subordination will graduate into something more dangerous. He has those attributes often associated with smallness - a quick temper, fast fists and a pugnacity to use them. We are less worried by the beatings he'll take than by those he'll hand out, and the places that will consequently offer him board and lodging - at Her Majesty's pleasure and our expense.</p> <p>We are not the only ones to notice. James, a member of the residents' association has too. He has a friend who knows someone who runs martial arts clubs for dysfunctional kids.</p> <p>James may be convinced but Scrap has his doubts: \"What's the effin' point? They wouldn't take me.\" For all the aggressive despair, there's a real yearning in what he says - and truth. They probably won't take him, but not for the reason he thinks. It won't be to do with where he comes from or lack of GCSEs or the right gear. It will be because he won't be willing to attend regularly, to make the hard yards.</p> <p>James is not so easily disappointed. He takes Scrap to the gym, throws in a post-workout burger, and within three weeks the boy is on programme.</p> <p>We also have our doubts. From where we are looking, sport (primarily the male variety) appears to promote precisely the sort of values that complement his dysfunctions. There is not a world of difference between the machismo of the locker room and that displayed most evenings outside the shop fronts. In both cases, individual weakness is subsumed into the strength of the pack.</p> <p>Increasingly, contemporary sport acts as a magnet and a refuge for the disaffected opting for a petulant life of perpetual puerility. Its chronic commitment to competition encourages an obsessive addiction to self. Some argue that such egopaths are best catered for under licence in the ring or on the pitch or track, but there are too many examples of their testosterone being employed against partners at home and in clubs against strangers.</p> <p>The link between sport and disaffection can be seen any evening at the local kickabout area. Scrap's well in there. So is Josh as he commits a hand ball and vigorously denies it, while Wayne takes Binliner's feet from under him and holds out his hands in innocence, before Aaron scores, fisting the air. It's ugly, graceless, immodest, and masculine. </p> <p>It is also dishonest. But who can blame them? They are simply doing here on the mean streets what they see beamed to them by satellite from extravagant stadia. That's where anything goes in the pursuit of winning, be it technological or pharmaceutical. Cheating contaminates contemporary sport.</p> <p>And cheating has origins. In the case of kids like Scrap, they have never \"played the game\", because they have never experienced the benefits of doing so. From their earliest moments in life's game they have suffered the injustices of arbitrary \"refereeing\", with adults handing out red cards and sin bins without reason or consistency. The only way they could remain on the pitch, in the ring, was to cheat, to finger siblings, feign injury, punch low, lurk offside.</p> <p>In Scrap's case, there was more than injustice. There had been low-level violence from a father preoccupied with pub and pool, high-level mental bullying from a mother distraught and distracted by siblings and an absent partner.</p> <p>James didn't inquire about Scrap's background; he believes kids are born bad and must have it knocked out of them through bootcamp disciplines. So he was surprised when six months down the line Scrap's father was taken to A&amp;E with broken ribs. We were not.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Stewart Dakers is a community voluntary worker.</p>",
  "<p>With his side unrecognisable from last Saturday there are no prizes for guessing how Tony Pulis feels about the League Cup this season, although progress in a competition that has caused embarrassment in recent years should not be too much of a hardship for the Stoke City manager.</p> <p>Premier League survival is the priority but those on the periphery of the first team took their chance to impress last night as Stoke overcame a brave Cheltenham Town side to reach the third round.</p> <p>It is only the second time since the turn of the century that Stoke have got that far, with their record since 2000 including defeats to Rochdale, Darlington, Mansfield, Oldham and Bury. The Stoke team-sheet, which included one survivor, Carl Dickinson, from the side that vanquished Aston Villa last Saturday, ought to have given Cheltenham further encouragement but Stoke had too many better players.</p> <p>Indeed, nothing other than a routine away victory looked likely when they struck twice in three second-half minutes. Glenn Whelan scored the first, the former Sheffield Wednesday midfielder curling a free-kick inside Shane Higgs' near upright after Shane Duff had upended Vincent P\u00e9ricard. Moments later Richard Cresswell added the second, the winger calmly slotting beyond the goalkeeper after leaving Jerry Gill trailing.</p> <p>That lead ought to have allowed Stoke to assume complete control but Cheltenham halved the deficit within three minutes. Ashley Vincent was the scorer, the forward tearing clear before drilling a low shot past Steve Simonsen and in off the near upright.</p> <p>Belief coursed through Keith Downing's side, but with 12 minutes remaining Stoke struck a third. Jon Parkin, whose waistline suggested he had spent pre-season downing alcoholic rather than isotonic drinks, capitalised on poor defending in the area to sweep home Danny Pugh's cross. Cheltenham still refused to concede defeat and they were rewarded in injury-time when Alex Russell, who had earlier managed to hit a free-kick out of the ground, flashed a powerful drive into the far corner.</p> <p>\"I am pleased with the performance because we made 10 changes tonight and they could have turned up here thinking it was going to be a stroll in the park but they didn't,\" said Pulis, who will not want to be reminded that Stoke lost 8-0 to Liverpool the last time they reached the third round, in 2000. \"There are a lot of players in that 10 who played a lot of games in the Championship last season, so I don't think it was that much of a gamble. But credit to Cheltenham, they made a fight of it. I am just pleased they scored their second goal really late.\"</p>",
  "<p>Hillary Clinton backed Barack Obama last night to be America's next president in an eagerly-awaited speech intended to end the divisions plaguing the party since the nomination battle ended in June.</p> <p>\"I ask all of you who worked so hard for me, who knocked on doors and made those phone calls, who got in arguments from time to time ... to work as hard for Barack Obama as you did for me,\" Clinton told a lunch crowd of about 2,500 who also heard from Obama's wife, Michelle.</p> <p>The stage was then set for her to use her main speech to the Democratic convention in a 75,000-seat football stadium to attack the Bush administration and Obama's Republican rival, John McCain. Clinton's combative stance, in a speech billed as one of the toughest of her political career, contrasted with the tack taken by Michelle Obama and others from the Obama camp on the opening day of the convention, during which they failed to set out detailed policy or to turn on the Republicans.</p> <p>The Obama camp was resentful that the Clintons dominated the second day of the convention and, with Bill Clinton speaking today, threatened to do the same today.</p> <p>Hillary Clinton yesterday formally released her supporters from the pledges made in the primary elections to support her, freeing them to unite behind Obama. But her appeal met a mixed reception, with some delegates adamant they would not help get Obama elected or even vote for him. \"They are going to go down to the bitter end,\" said a New York delegate, who had swung from Clinton to Obama.</p> <p>Clinton's speech came on a day of security alerts in Denver after reports of an alleged racially-motivated plot to kill Obama. It was revealed that three men were in police custody after guns, ammunition and the drug crystal meth were found in a truck that was stopped on the outskirts of Denver. Two high-powered rifles, a telescopic sight, a bulletproof vest, walkie-talkies and wigs were found.</p> <p>With police on alert for the convention, the materials set off a chain reaction. Police and FBI officials immediately began exploring the prospect of a threat to Obama's life.</p> <p>\"There is a fine line between a credible threat and a threat that is carried out,\" said Marcus Dudley, a detective with the Aurora police. \"It is not up to us to determine whether or not it was a credible threat. We can't sit and wait until folks have done the final analysis. We have a duty to react.\"</p> <p>The driver of the truck was named as Tharin Gartrell. Shawn Adolf, who wore a swastika ring and was wanted on drug charges was arrested when police came to the hotel where he was staying in a Denver suburb. He jumped from the sixth floor window landing on a flat roof with a broken ankle. He still ran, but was arrested.</p> <p>The third man, Nathan Johnson, was arrested at an upmarket hotel in Denver. His statements to police during an eight-hour interview appeared to have raised fears of a threat to Obama. In an interview with a local CBS station while in custody, Johnson accused the other two men of making racist statements about Obama. He said they had spoken about shooting Obama on the day of his speech, saying: \"He don't belong in political office or blacks don't belong in political office.\" Johnson denied being involved in the plot.</p> <p>Troy Eid, a Colorado federal prosecutor, last night said there was not enough evidence to suggest a plot to harm Obama and although officials were still investigating, and keeping an open mind, he said: \"The law recognises a difference between a true threat, one that can be carried out, and the reported racist rantings of drug abusers.\" But he said he had no explanation why the suspects would have hoarded powerful weapons if not to harm Obama.</p> <p>\"It is a very serious crime to threaten a presidential candidate ... the investigation is still ongoing,\" Eid said.</p>",
  "<p>It may not be the most obvious investment choice in these turbulent economic times. But a new venture is seeking to convince music fans to place their savings as well as their faith in rock 'n' roll.</p> <p>The music executives behind Kaiser Chiefs and Primal Scream are backing a new website that will allow music fans to invest financially as well as emotionally in hotly tipped new acts. </p> <p>The venture, dreamed up by a music business lawyer and backed by the founder of Friends Reunited, is being billed as the latest innovative funding model that could provide artists with an alternative to major labels. </p> <p>Bandstocks will let the public buy a stake in an artist in \u00a310 increments. Once funding reaches a preordained level, for example \u00a3100,000, the money will be released for the act to record an album. </p> <p><br>Investors will get a copy of the album, a credit on the CD sleeve and a percentage of the profits from its sale and licensing. They will also get priority ticket booking and the opportunity to buy limited edition releases. For the artist, founder Andrew Lewis claimed that Bandstocks would offer a better return than a major-label deal, as well as more freedom and control over copyright. </p> <p>He hoped that if successful, artists would return to release subsequent albums using the scheme. But he admitted its success or failure would depend on attracting sufficient investment from members of the public. The site, backed by investment from music manufacturing and distribution company The Vinyl Factory and four years in development, has launched with two artists. FrYars is a 19-year-old singer-songwriter who has been compared to Nick Cave, Rufus Wainwright and Lloyd Cole. Jersey Budd, another singer-songwriter, said he had turned down major-label deals to pursue funding through Bandstocks. </p> <p>\"I had the opportunity to do deals with a number of record labels but I'm confident about my music and the future of Bandstocks, which seems to be a much more honest and transparent way to release records,\" he said. </p> <p>The site is also looking to attract established artists. Former Boo Radleys guitarist and songwriter Martin Carr is to use the model to fund his next album. </p> <p>The founders of B-Unique, the label that is home to Kaiser Chiefs and others including Primal Scream and the Twang, will help find and select artists to appear. Mark Lewis and Martin Toher, the two former major label executives who launched B-Unique in 2001, will act as artist and repertoire advisers. </p> <p>Lewis said he hoped albums by about 10 artists would be funded by Bandstocks in its first year. Once the target figure is reached, the money will be spent on recording and marketing the album. Revenues from album sales and licensing will be divided up, with half going to the artist, 30% to the Bandstocks holders and 20% to the website.</p> <p>Lewis said Bandstocks would work with each artist to put together a bespoke operation. It will use the same independent distribution network as Arctic Monkeys, the White Stripes and Oasis. The shifting sands of the music business, blown about by the winds of technological change and rampant digital piracy, have given rise to a range of new funding models. Some artists, such as the Charlatans and Radiohead, have sought to give their music away free or on a \"pay what you like\" basis. </p> <p>Steve Pankhurst, the web developer who co-founded Friends Reunited in a back bedroom before selling it to ITV for \u00a3120m in 2005, has taken a small stake in Bandstocks.</p> <h2>Sales pitches</h2> <p><strong>Going it alone</strong><br>Radiohead released In Rainbows on a \"pay what you like\" basis to huge media interest, before later reissuing it conventionally. Millions downloaded the album, featuring Thom Yorke, but research suggested that many more simply obtained it illegally anyway. The Charlatans gave away You Cross My Path for nothing in the hope of boosting live and licensing revenues. </p> <p><strong>Venture capital</strong><br>Some private equity houses have done deals with managers or artists to bypass record labels. </p> <p><strong>Brands</strong><br>Bacardi recently signed a deal with Groove Armada to fund new releases in return for being able to use their tracks and live events to promote its brand. </p> <p><strong>Advertising</strong><br>A series of companies are attempting to launch ad-funded services. </p> <p><strong>Subscription</strong><br>Pay TV and broadband giant Sky plans a subscription service offering a mix of millions of streaming songs plus some downloads for a set monthly fee. It has signed a deal with Universal, with other labels expected to follow.</p>",
  "<p>A stand-off between the local government ombudsman and Trafford council in Manchester is exposing the limits of the ombudsman's powers and prompting calls for rulings to be made enforceable. </p> <p>Trafford is refusing to pay the \u00a3100,000 compensation recommended by the ombudsman for the family of Carly Wright, a young woman with profound disabilities whose needs were neglected by the council when she was due to transfer from children's services to those for adults. Her parents, Wilma and Peter Wright, have started an e-petition on the 10 Downing Street website, urging that all such rulings be made binding by law.</p> <p>This is not the first time that Conservative-run Trafford has defied the ombudsman. Last year, it refused to agree to waive repayment of a housing grant it had made to an elderly woman with mental health problems who had been unaware of a change in the rules governing such a clawback. The ombudsman in the case, Anne Seex, said she was dismayed that Trafford had \"responded in what I can only describe as a cavalier manner to the prejudice of a very vulnerable citizen\".</p> <p>That episode ended with Seex requiring the council to pay for space in the local press in which she set out her findings - the most that the ombudsman can do in the event of a local authority refusing to accept a ruling. Such a step has not yet been reached in the Wrights' case.</p> <p>Other councils that have rejected ombudsman recommendations include East Riding of Yorkshire and Blackpool. But Tony Redmond, lead ombudsman, says that while such cases are \"extremely disappointing\", they are few and far between. More than 17,000 complaints were made against councils in England last year and redress was obtained in 3,000 instances. \"We are talking about one or two a year where recommendations are not being implemented.\"</p> <p>Mandatory rulings would risk weakening the investigation process, Redmond argues. \"We know that we have to, in a sense, convince the council of the merits of our recommendations and the way they have been evidenced.\"</p> <p>The Wrights' e-petition is at <a href=\"http://petitions.number10.gov.uk/justiceforcarly/\">petitions.number10.gov.uk/justiceforcarly</a></p>",
  "<p>The haul of weapons confiscated at the weekend's Notting Hill carnival included knives, a Taser gun, CS spray and a baseball bat, police said yesterday.</p> <p>Officers patrolling the annual event arrested 330 people and stopped a further 151 potential troublemakers from travelling to west London.</p> <p>Although the Metropolitan police said their \"proactive\" approach had worked well, and more than a million people celebrated, the end of the street party on Monday night was marred by battles between police and 40 youths throwing bricks and bottles. </p> <p>Chief Inspector Jo Edwards said the crackdown - which included deploying knife scanner arches around the tube network - had helped ensure most of the weekend's 850,000 visitors enjoyed the event peacefully.</p> <p>\"It's disappointing that each year we see a small minority of mainly young men who don't come to the carnival until later,\" she said. </p> <p>\"They don't come to enjoy the floats and the music, they come to fight and commit acts of violence. We have seen serious incidents in previous years. </p> <p>\"For two hours our officers came under attack from bottles, bricks and any debris that was on the ground. These were officers who had been working hard all day.\" </p> <p>Police had been planning their operation to combat violence at the carnival since May. </p> <p>Tactics included sending letters to more than 200 suspected troublemakers warning them about their conduct and using warrants to search their homes for weapons.</p>",
  "<p>Russia's relations with the west plunged to their most critical point in a generation yesterday when the Kremlin built on its military rout of Georgia by recognising the breakaway provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia as independent states.</p> <p>Declaring that if his decision meant a new cold war, then so be it, President Dmitri Medvedev signed a decree conferring Russian recognition on Georgia's two secessionist regions. The move flouted UN security council resolutions and dismissed western insistence during the crisis of the past three weeks on respecting Georgia's territorial integrity and international borders.</p> <p>Last night, Medvedev accused Washington of shipping arms to Georgia under the guise of humanitarian aid.</p> <p>The Kremlin's unilateral decision to redraw the map of the strategically vital region on the Black Sea surprised and alarmed the west, and raised the stakes in the Caucasus crisis. Moscow challenged Europe and the US to respond, while calculating that western divisions over policy towards Russia would dilute any damage.</p> <p>Washington condemned the move. Britain called for a European coalition against Russian \"aggression\". Sweden said Russia had opted for a path of confrontation with the west, and international organisations denounced Medvedev's move as illegitimate and unacceptable.</p> <p>\"We are not afraid of anything, including the prospect of a new cold war,\" Medvedev said. \"Russia is a state which has to ensure its interests along the whole length of its border. This is absolutely clear.\"</p> <p>While Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, accused the US, a strong backer of President Mikheil Saakashvili of Georgia, of gunboat diplomacy by using its airforce and naval vessels to deliver humanitarian aid to Georgia, Medvedev last night went further.</p> <p>He said Russian forces were not blockading Georgia's Black Sea port of Poti. \"There is no blockade. Any ship can get in, American and others are bringing in humanitarian cargoes. And what the Americans call humanitarian cargoes - of course, they are bringing in weapons,\" he told the BBC.</p> <p>Last night a source close to the US embassy in Tbilisi said US warships had abandoned a plan to deliver supplies to the port. The USS McFaul had been due to arrive in Poti tomorrow after unloading supplies in the Georgian port of Batumi. </p> <p>The Nato secretary general, Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, said: \"Russia's actions in recent weeks call into question Russia's commitment to peace and stability in the Caucasus.\" </p> <p>But Moscow oozed confidence that the western response would be mostly bark and little bite, restricted to sharp words and some tolerable diplomatic sanctions. \"I don't think we should be afraid of isolation. I don't believe isolation is looming,\" said Lavrov. \"This should not really be a doomsday scenario.\"</p> <p>The Kremlin decision, prepared on Monday by the Russian parliament's unanimous vote in favour of independence for South Ossetia and Abkhazia, is widely seen as presaging Russian annexation at least of South Ossetia, a poor, crime-ridden mountain region of only 70,000 people which has little prospect of becoming a viable state.</p> <p>South Ossetia was the spark that ignited the crisis this month after Saakashvili launched a disastrous attempt to recapture the region and met a Russian invasion which crippled his country.</p> <p>\"Russia's actions are an attempt to militarily annex a sovereign nation ...in direct violation of international law,\" Saakashvili said last night. \"The Russian Federation is seeking to validate the use of violence, direct military aggression, and ethnic cleansing to forcibly change the borders of a neighbouring state.\"</p> <p>But senior Russian officials, from Medvedev down, launched a concerted attack on Saakashvili, accusing him of \"genocide\", of seeking to \"exterminate\" the people of South Ossetia, and of leaving Russia no alternative.</p> <p>\"This is not an easy choice to make, but it represents the only possibility to save human lives,\" said Medvedev. \"Saakashvili opted for genocide to accomplish his political objectives. By doing so, he himself dashed all the hopes for the peaceful coexistence of Ossetians, Abkhazians and Georgians in a single state.\"</p> <p>Lavrov said Russia's decision was \"absolutely inevitable, short of losing our dignity as a nation\". </p> <p>Dmitri Rogozin, Russia's ambassador to Nato, likened the international climate to the summer of 1914 before the first world war, and compared the Georgian leader to Gavrilo Princip, the Balkan assassin who shot the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne in Sarajevo.</p> <p>Russia's decision to recognise the two regions effectively killed off the ceasefire and peace plan negotiated a fortnight ago by France's President Nicolas Sarkozy on behalf of the European Union.</p> <p>Exasperated by Russia's refusal to observe the terms of the truce, Sarkozy has already called an emergency EU summit for Monday in Brussels. The meeting was supposed to chart a common EU position on Russia, but is as likely to expose Europe's dilemmas and divisions over how to deal with an increasingly assertive Kremlin.</p> <p>David Miliband, Britain's foreign secretary, said he wanted to forge \"the widest possible coalition against Russian aggression in Georgia. We fully support Georgia's independence and territorial integrity, which cannot be changed by decree from Moscow.\"</p> <p>But Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, while denouncing the Russian move as \"absolutely unacceptable\", said she wanted to keep dialogue running with Moscow.</p> <p>Miliband is due to fly to Kiev today to express British support for the Ukrainian government, which fears it could be next in line for Russian pressure aimed at thwarting its efforts to join Nato. </p> <p>Miliband is due to meet Ukraine's president, Viktor Yushchenko, and its prime minister, Yulia Tymoshenko, whose government is in a precarious position: seeking membership of Nato and the EU in the face of determined opposition from the country's Russian minority. </p> <p>Under a lease agreement, Russia's Black Sea fleet is based on Ukraine's Crimean peninsula, increasing Russian sensitivity to Ukraine's westward trajectory and Ukrainian vulnerability to pressure from Moscow.</p> <p>Miliband will make a speech today to a university audience in Kiev, in which he will laud Ukrainian democracy and warn Russia that its actions will cause long-term harm to its standing on the world stage.</p>",
  "<p>An official \"watch list\" of potentially troubled US banks has lengthened from 90 to 117 as the credit crunch wreaks havoc throughout the financial industry.</p> <p>The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which guarantees customers' money held in US banks, said the quarterly list was the longest since mid-2003 and is asking its members to increase contributions to a dwindling bail-out fund.</p> <p>\"These are challenging times,\" said the FDIC's chairman, Sheila Bair, at a press conference. \"More banks will come on the list as credit problems worsen.\"</p> <p>So far this year, nine US banks have collapsed including California's IndyMac Bancorp, the third largest failure of a high-street bank since the FDIC was created 75 years ago.</p> <p>The FDIC does not disclose the identity of institutions on its watch list. But it said the aggregate total of assets held by troubled banks had risen from $26bn to $78bn, partly because the FDIC seized control of $32bn at IndyMac.</p> <p>Profits at US banks fell 87% to $5bn in the second quarter. Bair described the figures as \"frankly, pretty dismal\". She added: \"By any yardstick, it was another tough quarter. We continue to strongly encourage banks and institutions to ensure they have enough reserves to cover losses.\"</p> <p>Bair stressed that the public should remain confident in the banking system: \"The overwhelming majority of banks - 98% of them - continue to be well capitalised by regulatory standards.\"</p> <p>In common with their larger competitors, regional US banks have been struggling to cope with a collapse in the value of mortgages and related securities. </p> <p>On Friday, Kansas-based Columbian Bank and Trust became the latest institution to be shut down by the FDIC, which usually acts at the end of the week so that it can use the weekend to reorganise and begin looking for buyers. The first $100,000 of each customer's deposits is guaranteed by the FDIC.</p> <p>Chastening times have taken their toll on the FDIC's resources. Its bail-out fund has dwindled from $53bn to $45bn. At 1.01% of insured deposits, this is below its target level of 1.15%. Under a \"restoration plan\" banks will be asked to increase their contributions.</p> <p>\"We believe institutions can and will step up to the plate to provide whatever insurance funds are needed,\" said Bair. The corporation is examining ways to get banks with riskier strategies to contribute at a higher rate.</p> <p>The FDIC has increased the number of staff handling banking failures by 60% as it faces the most challenging environment since the savings and loan crisis of the late 1980s which drove hundreds of small financial institutions out of business.</p> <p>It has faced criticism after it emerged that IndyMac Bancorp was not placed on the watch list until a few weeks before its demise.</p>",
  "<p>Many parents are missing out on the best daycare for their children because only 3% of providers are judged to be outstanding and 40% rate just satisfactory or worse, according to a three-year study by inspectors at Ofsted.</p> <p>The most serious complaints made in 90,000 inspections covered by the report included adults looking after too many children or not being properly vetted, and nurseries with no first aid kits.</p> <p>Despite improvements over the past three years, four out of 10 childminders, nurseries and after-school clubs still rate \"satisfactory\" or \"inadequate\", categories that Ofsted said indicate they must improve. That means many children are in average childcare lacking the staff and facilities to best prepare them for their later education, the report says. </p> <p>Margaret Morrissey, spokeswoman for the National Confederation of Parent Teacher Associations, said: \"Every parent wants the most outstanding place for their child, and there should be enough to go round.\" </p> <p>She said the scarcity of the very best provision added to the pressure on families trying to combine busy working lives with parenting. </p> <p>While only three in every hundred daycare settings - including childminders, nurseries or out-of-school clubs - were rated inadequate between 2005 and July this year, the proportion of childminders judged inadequate has tripled to 6%. Childminders, who look after small groups of children in their own homes, provide the bulk of childcare in England. </p> <p>The quality of nurseries has improved and is significantly better than after-school clubs, the review found. The most experienced carers or longest-established nurseries tended to fare better in inspection reports than newer facilities. </p> <p>The report says: \"The proportion of daycare providers inspected with good or outstanding childcare has risen from 53% in 2005-06 to 64% in 2007-08, though the proportion of childminders judged good or outstanding has fallen from 65% to 59%.\"</p> <p>The chief inspector, Christine Gilbert, warned that the government's new curriculum for under-fives was too complicated for many settings, which would not cope with its controversial requirements for children to learn to read and write before they start school. The curriculum, called the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS), comes into force in two weeks' time and will see all childcare providers obliged to rate children's progress against 69 separate measures, which include using simple phonics to read and write. </p> <p>Ministers said that the EYFS would help improve the standard of childcare, and dismissed critics who say it will be misused in substandard settings and will shackle the best settings and those which use alternative methods. </p> <p>The Ofsted report found wide local variations in the quality of childcare. In the 30 most deprived areas, 47% were not good enough, rating only satisfactory or worse, compared with 40% nationally. Only half of childminders in London are said to be good enough, compared with 64% in other areas of the country. </p> <p>It documents 24,000 complaints, many made by parents but most anonymously, setting out concerns that the people working with children were not properly trained or had not been vetted to work with children. Others alleged that the legal child-to-adult ratios were not being met. Despite the complaints reflecting broadly those made by inspectors after visits to inadequate settings, 70% were dismissed after an investigation. </p> <p>Morrissey said: \"Parents should keep the Ofsted reports in perspective. It's the experience of one inspector on one day and they fulfil an important function in keeping things safe. But the school gate and nursery car park are the best places to find out what a nursery is like.\"</p> <p>Christine Gilbert, Ofsted's chief inspector, said: \"Though only a small proportion [of childcare settings] are inadequate, that masks the fact that there are almost twice as many inadequate childminders this year. Providers judged to be inadequate have significant improvements to make if they are to meet the demands of the EYFS and provide the high-quality education and care children deserve.\"</p> <p>The Department for Children, Schools and Families said: \"It's heartening that childcare in this country is improving, but we want to drive up standards even further. That is why we are introducing the EYFS in September, which will give every child equal right to the best-quality care and learning.\"</p> <h2>Common problems</h2> <p>Some 94% of daycare providers were given at least one order to improve. The most common of the more serious problems was making sure adults had undergone proper child safety vetting and were fully trained. Other providers were told to employ the number of staff required by law - one adult for every three children under two, one adult per four two-year-olds, and one for every eight children aged three to seven. Other orders included making sure staff knew child protection procedures, took proper registers and had first aid arrangements.</p>",
  "<p>Doctors are today told to investigate the family history of every patient with high cholesterol in an attempt to track down tens of thousands of people who carry the gene that makes them a prime candidate for early death from heart attack.</p> <p>New guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (Nice) recommend a major DNA testing programme in an attempt to save the lives of those with inherited high cholesterol - thought to be one in every 500 people. Half of all men with the genetic mutation causing familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) will die before they are 50 without treatment and a third of all women before they are 60.</p> <p>FH causes the arteries to clog and narrow, but if it is caught early enough, treatment with statins, together with a healthy diet and lifestyle, particularly no smoking, can give those affected a near-normal life expectancy.</p> <p>So far, doctors know the identity of 15,000 of the estimated 110,000 people with the gene. Nice today recommends \"cascade\" testing to find the rest. If doctors suspect a patient has FH, they should ask whether close relatives have died early from heart attacks - and if so, they should advise that other family members should come for cholesterol testing and DNA tests. \"This is the first time genetic testing has been recommended for a common disease,\" said Steve Humphries, a professor of cardiovascular genetics and member of the Nice guideline development group.</p> <p>Close family have a 50-50 chance of also having FH, he said. \"Using cascade testing, we should be able to move to the point where we have identified the majority [of people with FH]. In the long-term future, we will be able to find them all.\"</p> <p>The children of people with FH should be tested before they reach the age of 10 but not before they are two, said Andrew Neil, professor of clinical epidemiology at Oxford. \"Dietary changes are possible from the age of two,\" he said. \"They can be offered semi-skimmed milk. It is crucially important no children should ever start smoking if they have FH. If they smoke, it multiplies their risk by two-and-a-half-fold. Almost without exception children will require treatment with statins by 18, but very small numbers of children will need treatment earlier.\"</p> <p>Two statins had been licensed for use in children, he said, but there was also very good evidence of their efficacy and safety from widespread adult use and trials. Because of concerns about potential effects on the foetus, women with FH should stop taking statins three months before they try to become pregnant.</p> <p>Philip Rowlands, who has FH and was a member of the guideline development group, said his father had died of a heart attack at 51, when he was 12. Rowlands has been on statins for 14 years, exercises regularly and has a good diet. \"My prognosis is excellent. I was given the chance to control my life, unlike my father,\" he said.</p>",
  "<h2>Credit crunch and dearer fuel cut traffic jams</h2> <p>The credit crunch and high fuel prices have reduced congestion on motorways and major roads by 12% in the first six months of this year compared with the same period last year, according to figures from Trafficmaster and the RAC Foundation yesterday.

Several pallets containing large cheese wheels were taken from the back of the vehicle. A police spokesman said: \"It would have taken some time to unload the pallets, which were spread over the verge. The thieves would have had to have used a large vehicle to remove all the cheese.

  "<p>England beat South Africa with embarrassing ease yesterday. Knocked sideways by Stuart Broad's compelling new-ball spell that brought him five wickets, and all out for only 83, their second lowest total ever, the tourists were a spent force by the time they came to bowl.

As for Broad, on his home ground and the one on which 21 years ago his father Chris top-scored for England against Pakistan in his only limited-overs international here, his five for 23 represent the fifth best figures by an England bowler, behind an admittedly motley collection of Paul Collingwood, Mark Ealham, Vic Marks and Craig White. Had Nel not swung the bat to considerable effect in Broad's final over to claim three boundaries and thus top-score with 13, only Collingwood, who managed six for 31 against Bangladesh on this ground in 2005, would stand above him.</p> <p>If South Africa's dismal display, following on from their defeat in the first match at Headingley, served only to reinforce the view that their energies were dissipated in seeking the win in the Test series and that home awaits them enticingly now, then this was not a good pitch on which to play such a game.</p> <p>There can be few who do not, in general, wish to see a more equal contest between bat and ball than is frequently the case, but the Trent Bridge surface, which has seen so many low scores in the past season, offered too much help for a bowler of Broad's height and - on the evidence of the speed gun - pace. Smith's decision to bat first was presumably predicated on the dual belief that his team enjoy chasing a finite target and that under lights, not least in the transitional twilight period when viewing can be difficult, the bowlers would receive more assistance.</p> <p>It was an error of judgment, however. Broad, relaxing in a manner that has been elusive in Test matches and achieving excellent rhythm from the Pavilion end, found bounce and consistent accuracy to offer no respite. The ball did not perform acrobatics but did just sufficient laterally as well as vertically to make life uncomfortable. Such was the manner in which he sliced open the South African order, including a burst of four wickets in 16 deliveries, and so effective was Andrew Flintoff in replacing a lacklustre Jimmy Anderson - only eight overs from him in two matches now - that the potential peril of Steve Harmison was required for only a single over, although that was enough for him to claim a brace of cheap wickets. </p> <p>When Flintoff yorked Dale Steyn to end the innings, the effort causing the bowler to roll over on the ground, it was merely a physical representation of the South African batting. There was still plenty of life in the pitch when England batted but the guts had gone from the opposition, and with Smith unlikely to play again because of tennis elbow they will now find it hard to regroup sufficiently to contest strongly in the remaining three fixtures at The Oval, Lord's and Cardiff.</p> <p>Broad was the only choice as man of the match, but in terms of the immediate future of the England side in both forms of the game it has been immense for Prior. The inadequacies of Tim Ambrose with the bat have given Prior a chance here to stake a claim not just for one-day games but Tests as well and in two matches now he has managed to raise his game. The confidence placed in him by the captain is paramount, and the manner in which he took on the catch to dismiss Smith spoke volumes of his intent to take risks. </p> <p>The chance was flying to Owais Shah at first slip; Prior could have left it and that would have been sound judgment. He could have made a mess of it and been summarily castigated as a plonker. Instead he caught it brilliantly. For someone who suffered so much in the heat and humidity of Sri Lanka, and was subsequently relieved of his position, it was brave stuff. From that base comes confidence with the bat: his unbeaten 45 took only 36 balls and contained six fours and a six.</p>",
  "<p>The looming threat to power sharing in Northern Ireland deepened yesterday after the first minister, Peter Robinson, warned that the IRA army council has to be dissolved before policing and justice is devolved to the Stormont assembly. </p> <p>The Democratic Unionist leader was responding to threats from Sinn F\u00e9in that republicans would pull out of the power-sharing government unless control of the police and the judiciary was transferred to Stormont. </p> <p>Robinson also challenged Sinn F\u00e9in to urge its members and supporters to pass on information about dissident republican terror groups as evidence that the party fully supported law and order. </p> <p>\"The DUP is impatient with the foot-dragging on ending the IRA army council and wants to see a greater flow of information to the police about those who were nurtured by the IRA but who now continue attacks under different labels. The move to democracy is an ongoing commitment and a continuing journey. It is not a move of convenience or a tactical step,\" he said. </p> <p>Robinson added that if the devolved cabinet failed to meet next month the whole power-sharing project would be plunged into crisis. </p> <p>\"A meeting of the executive has been scheduled for September 18. If this meeting were not to take place it is self-evident that there would be serious consequences for the good government of Northern Ireland and indeed potentially for those who refuse to fulfil their legal obligations,\" he added. </p> <p>Sinn F\u00e9in appeared yesterday to be trying to tone down the heated exchanges with the DUP. The party's Dublin MEP, Mary Lou McDonald, said: \"We have agreements in terms of justice and policing, in terms of the Irish Language Act and so on, and we want those delivered on. It's not a case of threatening anything. It's just a case of recommitting ourselves to actually delivering.\" </p> <p>McDonald added that Sinn F\u00e9in had tried unsuccessfully to negotiate with the DUP over the summer.</p>",
  "<p>Joe Biden, who is set to make his debut as the Democratic vice-presidential candidate in Denver tonight, reflected on the expectations generated by the prospect of a Barack Obama presidency yesterday, describing the election as the most important the Democrats have faced since the 1930s. </p> <p>The normally verbose and gaffe-prone senator from Delaware has been unusually quiet since Obama named him on Saturday as his running mate. The silence is partly because of a call from Obama's team for more discipline.</p> <p>On Monday, stopping outside Boney's Smokehouse barbecue stand in the centre of Denver, he refused to be drawn by reporters' questions, an almost unheard of occurrence for him. </p> <p>But speaking to delegates from his home state yesterday he acknowledged the expectation raised about an Obama administration, drawing a parallel with the presidency that delivered the New Deal. He called the November election \"the most incredible opportunity any president and vice-president will have since Franklin Roosevelt\". He will have a chance to expand on that as the main speaker at the convention tonight, a role made more difficult than usual by having to follow Bill Clinton.</p> <p>Biden, 65, and the veteran chairman of the Senate's foreign affairs committee, is hoping to eclipse the former president by outlining a radical shift in US foreign policy to repair what he regards as the wreckage of the Bush administration.</p> <p>Crucial to that would be his role in the White House. There is a tendency to downplay the vice-presidency, both during a campaign and in the subsequent administration.</p> <p>But Robert Dallek, professor of history at Boston University and the pre-eminent scholar on US presidents said yesterday that while vice-presidents never used to be important, \"all changed in 1960 when Kennedy chose Lyndon Johnson as his running mate\". The subsequent trend culminated in Dick Cheney's accumulation of immense power under George Bush. Dallek thought that the degree of power attained by Cheney \"will make the next president cautious about giving the vice-president too much authority\". </p> <p>But others at the convention said it would not be easy to rein Biden in, given he is more experienced in foreign policy than Obama. There also appears to be little sign from the Obama camp that it necessarily wanted to roll back the centralisation of national security policy within the vice-president's office.</p> <p>Biden spent the weekend with Obama's chief strategist, David Axelrod, in Delaware before travelling to Denver by train. He also met his security team for a briefing on the 24-hour surveillance that comes with the job.</p> <p>In between, he has been working on tonight's speech. As well as setting out foreign policy he has been tasked with attacking the Republican candidate, John McCain. There has been a tendency at the conference so far to avoid attack politics but that does not apply to Biden, who unlike Obama is a scrapper able to deliver what a Democratic adviser described as \"zingers\" against McCain.</p> <p>Another asset on the campaign trail is that Biden, from a Catholic working-class background in Scranton, Pennsylvania, might make a better job than Obama of connecting with white, working-class men in battlefield states such as Pennsylvania and Ohio. </p> <p>While Biden's appointment has been generally well-received there are sceptics. Bloggers on liberal websites say that, for all the claims about this ability to connect with working-class voters, he only won 638 votes in the New Hampshire primary in January, forcing him to pull out.</p> <p>Among the sceptics is William Galston, a former Bill Clinton adviser and now senior fellow at the Washington-based Brookings Institution, who said in a commentary sent to reporters that previous presidents had chosen running mates who could help swing their home states. </p> <p>If Obama fails to win the election, he predicted \"an orgy of second-guessing\" over whether he could have chosen someone who might have delivered a crucial state. Obama chose Biden not primarily for his campaigning skills but with a view to government. Dallek said Biden was a good choice, especially against the background of security scares. \"If for some reason Obama is incapacitated or, perish the thought, dies in office, people know he would be a competent president.\" </p> <p>Steve Clemons, a director the Washington-based New America Foundation and among the first to tip Biden for the vice-presidential slot, is among those who argue that Biden's exercise of power in the White House would be similar to that of Cheney's. \"The office of vice-president has changed forever,\" he said. \"The office has explicit legal powers now. Maybe some will be rolled back but they can't be rolled back easily.\" </p> <p>The difference is that while Cheney used that accumulated power to push rightwing positions, Biden would seek to exercise it in pursuit of liberal ones. Like Obama, he is committed to an early withdrawal of US troops from Iraq - a war that he now regrets voting for - favours direct negotiations with Iran, wants a more aggressive approach by Pakistan towards the Taliban and al-Qaida and more pressure on Sudan over Darfur.</p> <p>Jim Webb, the Virginia senator who was on the shortlist for the vice-president slot, saw Biden as important because of his long experience. \"He's a rudder... He has a handle on the bureaucracy and knows how to get things done,\" Webb said.</p>",
  "<p>The director Fran\u00e7ois Ozon is in a funny place right now. No, not the London hotel bar where he is occupying a darkened corner and holding court on the subject of Angel, his ninth movie in ten years.</p> <p>I'm referring to his career. At 41, Ozon is snagged between the enfant terrible status that he occupied around the time of his 1998 debut Sitcom and... well, what, exactly? It's hard to say. </p> <p>He has never knowingly compromised \u2014 he rebuffed the Hollywood studios whose interest in Angel was predicated on changing the downbeat ending. (\"I would not have final cut in Hollywood,\" he says. \"In France, a director must have final cut. It's the law.\") And he tells me that after he enjoyed blockbuster-level success at home with the musical-whodunit 8 Women, his producer badgered him to make 8 Women II and III - or 16 Women and 24 Women as they might have been called.</p> <p>Did the producer in question not glance through Ozon's back catalogue? This is a director defined by his eclectic choice of subjects and styles, his refusal to repeat himself. Here's an example. His last film, Time to Leave, was an intelligent, weirdly sexy weepie. Angel is a period piece, a heightened melodrama. And he describes his next movie, Ricky, which he is currently editing, as \"very strange. It's realistic but it has special effects. It's a mix between Cronenberg and \u2014 I don't know what\u2014um... the Dardenne brothers!\"</p> <p>But despite such consistently adventurous work, Ozon hasn't yet had the kind of international breakthrough hit that unlocked and broadened the appeal of comparable directors like Pedro Almod\u00f3var or Todd Haynes. </p> <p>Perhaps the problem is that there's no keeping up with him. He can seem like a one-man series of Stars In Their Eyes: Tonight, Matthew, he is going to be Polanski (Regarde la mer), Bunuel (Sitcom), Fassbinder (Water Drops on Burning Rocks), Chabrol (Swimming Pool) or maybe Douglas Sirk, Vincente Minnelli and Jacques Demy all at the same time (8 Women). These pictures are witty, visually stylish and multi-textured, shot through with Ozon's breezy sensibility. </p> <p>Occasionally he has even dropped the mask and revealed himself as a master of his own making, the best example being Under the Sand, a disconcerting psychological drama starring Charlotte Rampling as a woman whose husband strolls into the sea one morning and simply disappears. The late Ingmar Bergman called it a \"masterpiece\" and admitted to watching it on a regular basis \u2014 the sort of praise that makes a mockery of any five-star review, any Oscar.</p> <p>That was eight years ago. In recent times, Ozon's sometimes frivolous work has returned to the sobriety of Under the Sand, addressing sombre matters like marital breakdown (5x2 \u2014 to my mind, his one outright failure) or terminal illness (Time to Leave). I break it to him that, in the UK at least, the consensus is that he is becoming respectable.</p> <p>\"Ah, do you think so?\" he chuckles. <br>Well, I explain, he used to be considered rather naughty.<br>\"Naughty in a bad way?\"<br>No, naughty in an Almod\u00f3var way.<br>\"But now, you see, I am getting old.\"</p> <p>The only physical sign that this boyish-looking Parisian has aged since we first met in 1998 is his current get-up: the white shirt, black jacket and blue jeans ripped at one knee are now topped off with a pale blue scarf wrapped around his neck and flung theatrically over one shoulder. Either he's going for that Dirk Bogarde look from the collar up, or he has the mother of all hickeys. </p> <p>Angel is a return to the provocative Ozon of yore \u2014 the man who included a gratuitous shot of an erect penis in Sitcom just for the hell of it, or turned fairy-tale convention inside-out in Criminal Lovers by having the Hansel character spurn his Gretel for the bed of the grizzled woodcutter who had imprisoned them both. Based on the 1957 novel The Real Life of Angel Deverell by Elizabeth Taylor (no, not that one), Angel is a brash, deliberately overcooked film tracing the speedy rise of a self-absorbed young novelist (Romola Garai) in early-20th century England.</p> <p>One of the fascinating things about Angel Deverell is that, like the crime novelist in Swimming Pool, she actually isn't much cop as a writer. \"No, she is not good,\" admits Ozon. \"But it is easier to show someone who is not a genius, a bad painter rather than a Picasso. For me, it's not important that Angel is a poor writer. What's important is her energy, her will, her strength. I think Angel has a gift but her problem is she becomes popular when she is too young. It happens all the time. Barbara Cartland was a success with this shit that she writes, and she never changed. Maybe if she'd been a big flop she would have become Emily Bront\u00eb.\" He laughs at the idea. \"Maybe not.\"</p> <p>Some reviewers have missed the point of the film by a good country mile, taking Garai to task for being shrill and obnoxious \u2014 exactly how the character is supposed to come off \u2014 or bemoaning the dodgy back-projection which provides a deliberate throwback to filmmaking of the 40s and 50s. Angel is as much a commentary on the genre of the costume drama and the prestigious literary adaptation as it is a film of Elizabeth Taylor's novel. Its exaggerated artificiality marks it out as a movie about cinema in the vein of Far From Heaven, The Good German or Ozon's earlier 8 Women.</p> <p>The director tells me he was approached by a young man after an advance screening of the movie. \"He asked me, 'Is it because your film is low-budget that all your special effects are so bad?' I said, 'It's a choice! It's to explain the disconnectedness of the characters.' Some people don't understand that. They haven't seen those old films which look like that; they are used to Harry Potter and The Lord of the Rings, where the effects are perfect. I realized at that point my film was complex. Before that, I thought it was mainstream. Maybe it's mainstream for people who are 60 years old, or for gay men. I don't know. If you don't have that perspective, maybe it seems too strange, too perverse. When I make a film, I always assume the audience is clever.\"</p> <p>He says he was never concerned that audiences would find Angel herself completely monstrous. \"Oh, but she is a monster!\" he hoots. \"That's why I like her. I love monsters. I know everyone won't like her. But for me, she's very touching. I think Romola is so clever. She understood the part completely. She said, 'Angel is a character. She's acting her life.' We are all acting, but with Angel it's more extreme.\"</p> <p>Ozon has remarked before that what he experiences when he directs actresses is something like falling in love. I wonder whether, as an openly gay director, the same thing ever happens with his male performers. \"Not often,\" he says. \"With Melvil Poupaud [who played a photographer dying of cancer in Time to Leave], I felt like he was an actress. He was very easy to work with, as was Michael Fassbender [in Angel]. They had no problem being directed by a man.\" And some actors do? \"Many, many men have that problem. They can't accept their feminine side. It becomes this big fight, and sometimes it's boring \u2014 I want to work, not fight.\"</p> <p>Actresses began throwing themselves at Ozon after witnessing the magic he worked with Charlotte Rampling in Under the Sand. And he has served them well \u2014 the likes of Rampling (who returned in Swimming Pool and now Angel), Isabelle Huppert, Ludivine Sagnier, Valeria Bruni-Tedeschi and now Garai all have good cause to keep a special Batphone-style emergency line open for the next time Ozon writes another part for them. There is a sense too that these roles are surrogate versions of himself. </p> <p>Let's face it, his CV is not exactly short on self-portraiture. He has admitted to shades of autobiography in both the middle-aged bully and his masochistic toy-boy in Water Drops on Burning Rocks, in the young, pyjama-clad manipulator in 8 Women, the writer in Swimming Pool and even the rat in Sitcom. In the same category is Victor, a saucy early short about a teenager who kills his parents and props up their corpses on the garden swings. Job done, he pleasures himself on the lawn and forms the third point in a sweaty threesome with the maid and her tattooed boyfriend.</p> <p>\"Victor was a film about my adolescence,\" he says before rushing to clarify. \"It was a dream of me. I didn't actually kill my parents \u2014 only in the film.\" So where are the overlaps between Fran\u00e7ois Ozon and Angel Deverell? \"I recognise myself in her as this child living in her dreams. For me as a child my strength, my way to survive difficulties, was to have a big imagination. But that is the only similarity. When you are successful there is a temptation to become a diva. And when I am being applauded, I am not like Angel: I don't get swept along in it. I just wonder, 'What am I doing here?'\"</p> <p>\u2022 Angel is released on 29 August.</p>",

  "<p>An official \"watch list\" of potentially troubled US banks has lengthened from 90 to 117 institutions as the credit crunch wreaks havoc throughout the financial industry.</p> <p>The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which guarantees customers' money held at US banks, said the quarterly list was at its longest since mid-2003 and is asking its members to increase contributions to a dwindling bail-out fund.</p> <p>\"These are challenging times,\" said the FDIC's chairman, Sheila Bair, at a press conference in Washington. \"More banks will come on the list as credit problems worsen.\"</p> <p>So far this year, nine US banks have collapsed including California's IndyMac Bancorp, the third largest failure of a high-street bank since the FDIC was created 75 years ago.</p> <p>The FDIC does not disclose the identity of the institutions on its watch list. But it said the aggregate total of assets held by troubled banks has risen from $26bn to $78bn, partly because the FDIC seized control of $32bn at IndyMac.</p> <p>Profits at US banks dived by 87% to $5bn in the second quarter. Bair described the figures as \"frankly, pretty dismal\".</p> <p>\"By any yardstick, it was another tough quarter,\" she said. </p> <p>\"We continue to strongly encourage banks and institutions to ensure they have enough reserves to cover losses.\"</p> <p>Bair stressed, however, that the public should remain confident in the banking system: \"The overwhelming majority of banks \u2013 98% of them \u2013 continue to be well capitalised by regulatory standards.\"</p> <p>In common with their larger competitors on Wall Street, regional US banks have been struggling to cope with a collapse in the value of mortgages and related securities. </p> <p>On Friday, Kansas-based Columbian Bank and Trust became the latest institution to be shut down by the FDIC, which usually acts at the end of the week so that it can use the weekend to reorganise and begin looking for buyers.

  "<p>The Russian-Georgian conflict has all the familiar ingredients: ethnic cleansing, headstrong politicians, hyper-nationalist separatists. Not a few commentators likened the conflict to Bosnia circa 1991 - a powder keg just waiting to explode. </p> <p>And explode it did. Yet perhaps the Balkans, too, holds the solution to bringing about peace in the Caucasus. I have spent the past few weeks <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV-wcjaNEPI\">working with Bosnian refugees in Brcko</a>, a city in the north whose position along a narrow sliver of land dividing Croat and Serbian parts of Bosnia gave it strategic importance in the run-up to war. Some analysts called it \"Bosnia's Kirkuk\", not because it has oil but because of how disputed it was. </p> <p>The city was flattened during the war but has since been rebuilt. Most refugees have moved back (albeit in squat quarters outside the city). And its renovated downtown now bustles with activity. Young Bosnians sip espresso, chain smoke and nibble on <em>chevapi</em> (mince meat) in the town's many outdoor cafes. A glassy new mall swells with shoppers. </p> <p>More importantly is the way in which Bosnians brought Brcko back from the dead. Though predominantly Serb, the city is now the only truly multiethnic place in Bosnia, an experiment that has been (mostly) successful. While local eateries are still segregated by sect, its courts, schools, and government institutions are by law intermixed between Bosniaks (Muslims), Serbs and Croats. When <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/radovankaradzic\">Radovan Karadzic</a>, a Bosnian Serb war criminal, was nabbed earlier this summer, nobody took to the streets in protest. Unlike Belgrade, in Brcko there is no graffiti comparing pro-EU Serbian leaders to Judas. </p> <p>Of course, not everything is perfect. A local policeman and fingerprint specialist told me that because of Brcko's strict hiring quotas, government ministers too often are unqualified or incompetent. The rivers that run through town are rumored to still be pockmarked with unexploded ordnance. And mass graves have been found nearby in recent years, serving as stark reminders of the war. </p> <p>Still, hang out with younger generations of Bosnians and you cannot help but feel hopeful for the future. At <a href=\"http://www.fireflybosnia.org/\">Camp Firefly</a> where I was volunteering, the kids of Bosnian refugees come together each summer to sing songs, break bread, and swim in the sun. They listen to bad European pop music and clutch their mobile phones. More important, they identify as Bosnians, not Serbs, Croats or Bosniaks. While some kids remain oblivious to the ethnic divisions that divided their parents, sensitivities persist. When the cook (an ethnic Croat) asked the no-pork table at the cafeteria if it was the \"Muslim table\", one of the campers took offense and snapped that they were not all Muslims. </p> <p>But back to Georgia and its festering separatist conflict: Does Brcko hold any lessons for bringing reconciliation to the Caucasus, a region teeming with separatism, nationalism and ethnic hatreds? Perhaps. After all, Bosnian Serbs, Croats and Muslims - like their Georgian, Russian and South Ossetian counterparts - once lived in peace before the war. It was the politicians who whipped up nationalist sentiment for nefarious reasons. But unlike Bosnia, where there was an international force present to keep the peace after the war, in the Caucasus the Russians operate as the sole peacekeeper, peace-broker, and peace-breaker - a variant of the judge, jury and executioner analogy. </p> <p>Without a true international presence on the ground, it would be practically impossible to replicate the Brcko model for, say, South Ossetia or Abkhazia (and fat chance the Russians would ever allow it). Plus there is the Kosovo precedent. Russians have more wiggle room to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/27/world/europe/27russia.html?_r=1&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin\">demand independence for these breakaway provinces</a> because of the legal precedent set by Kosovo earlier this year. </p> <p>But reconciliation is not out of reach, especially now that the once remote conflict has garnered such worldwide attention. Again, take what happened in Bosnia. Just a decade after it lied in ruins and everything looked hopeless, teenagers from warring ethnic factions now toss water balloons at each other, not grenades. Multiethnic cities like Brcko are on the up-and-up. Even the <a href=\"http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/946\">Old Bridge in Mostar</a> - Bosnia's crown jewel, destroyed by Croat forces in the early 1990s - has been rebuilt and now throngs with tourists.</p> <p>Bosnians are aware of the ethnic fighting that engulfed their fractious country but remain optimistic of the future. They understand that integration, not separation, is the key to their success. Things are not always harmonious. As one Bosnian woman put it: \"We don't love each other but we tolerate each other.\" But that still beats killing each other. </p> <p>Indeed, the conflict in the Caucasus would do well to follow the Bosnian model.</p>",

But Robert Dallek, professor of history at Boston university and the pre-eminent scholar on US presidents, said today that while vice-presidents never used to be important, \"that all changed in 1960 when Kennedy chose Lyndon Johnson as his running mate\".</p> <p>The subsequent trend culminated in Cheney's accumulation of immense power.</p> <p>Dallek thought that the degree of power attained by Cheney \"will make the next president cautious about giving the vice-president too much authority\".</p> <p>But others at the convention argued that it will not be easy to rein Biden in, given he is much more experienced in foreign policy than Obama and that, anyway, there appeared to be little sign from the Obama camp that it necessarily wanted to roll back the centralisation of national security policy within the vice-president's office.</p> <p>Biden spent the weekend through until Sunday morning with Obama's chief strategist, David Axelrod, in Delaware before travelling to Denver by train. </p> <p>He also met his new security team for a briefing on the 24-hour surveillance that comes with the job.</p> <p>In between, he has been working on tomorrow night's speech. As well as setting out foreign policy for a new administration, he has been tasked with attacking the Republican candidate, John McCain. </p> <p>There has been a tendency at the conference so far to avoid attack politics but that does not apply to Biden, who unlike Obama, is a scrapper, able to deliver what a Democratic adviser described as \"zingers\" against McCain.</p> <p>Another asset on the campaign trail is that Biden, aged 65, from a Catholic working-class background in Scranton, Pennsylvania, might make a better job than Obama of connecting with white working-class males in the key battlefield states such as Pennsylvania and Ohio.</p> <p>While the appointment of Biden has been generally well-received at the conference, there are sceptics. </p> <p>Bloggers on liberal web sites point out that, for all the claims about this ability to connect with working-class voters, he only won a miserable 638 votes in the New Hampshire primary in January, forcing him to pull out.</p> <p>Among the sceptics is William Galston, a former Bill Clinton adviser and now a senior fellow at the Washington-based Brookings Institution, who said, in a commentary sent out to reporters, that previous presidents had chosen running mates who could help swing their home states. </p> <p>\"One thing is clear: Biden does nothing to brighten Obama's prospects in the electoral college,\" he wrote. If Obama fails to win the November election, he predicted \"an orgy of second-guessing\" over whether he could have chosen someone who might have delivered a crucial state.</p> <p>Obama chose Biden not primarily for his campaigning skills but with a view to government. Dallek said Biden was a good choice, especially against the background of security scares. </p> <p>\"If for some reason Obama is incapacitated - or, perish the thought, dies in office - people know he would be a competent president,\" Dallek said.</p> <p>Steve Clemons, a director the Washington-based New America Foundation, who is close to the Democratic foreign policy establishment and who was among the first to tip Biden for the vice-presidential slot, is at the convention and is among those who argue that Biden's exercise of power in the White House would be similar to that of Cheney's.</p> <p>While he acknowledged that Obama as president might seek to rein in the vice-president, he said: \"The office of vice-president has changed forever. The office has explicit legal powers now. Maybe some will be rolled back but they can't be rolled back easily. The template of being a big player in foreign affairs is established.\"</p> <p>The difference is that while Cheney used that accumulated power to push right-wing ideological positions, Biden would seek to exercise it in pursuit of liberal ones. Like Obama, he is committed to an early withdrawal of US troops from Iraq, a war that he now regrets having voted for, favours direct negotiations with Iran, wants to encourage a more aggressive approach by the Pakistan government towards the Taliban and al-Qaida elements inside its borders, and more pressure on the Sudanese government over Darfur.</p> <p>In recent years, he has displayed his liberal background by helping to block the long-term appointment of the neo-conservative, John Bolton, to the United Nations and to force a softening the Bush administration's position towards Iran during a bout of sabre-rattling last year.</p> <p>Thomas Mann, another Brookings politics specialist, who is in Denver, said he thought Biden was a good choice but would not be as powerful as Cheney. </p> <p>\"All vice-presidents since (Walter) Mondale (vice-president from 1977-81) have played a more important role than had historically been the case. I look for Biden to play a role more like (Al) Gore to Clinton,\" Mann said.</p> <p>Jim Webb, the Virginia senator who was on the shortlist for the vice-presidency slot, saw Biden as having an important role because of his long experience. \"He's a rudder... He has a handle on the bureaucracy and knows how to get things done,\" Webb said.</p>",

  "<p>In India, anyone considered a threat to public order or security of the state can be preventatively locked up under the National Security Act for up to one year without trial or the requirement for the police to produce formal charges in court. The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_(Special_Powers)_Act,_1958\">Armed Forces Special Powers Act</a>, operational in areas declared \"disturbed\" (for instance, Manipur and Jammu and Kashmir) gives soldiers licence to shoot to kill anyone breaching a law or official order prohibiting the assembly of five or more persons. Under the <a href=\"http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/india/document/actandordinances/the_unlawful_activities_act1967.htm\">Unlawful Activities Prevention Act</a>, an accused can be denied the right to proceedings in an open court, which is an essential element of a fair trial. Moreover, the criminal procedure code \u2013 the police officers' and judges' rule book \u2013 prevents courts, without prior permission of the government, from prosecuting public servants for offences committed while \"acting or purporting to act\" in the discharge of official duty. Government permission to prosecute members of law enforcement agencies accused of torture and extrajudicial killings is often, however, not forthcoming. </p> <p>Every year at its <a href=\"http://www.civicusassembly.org/\"> World Assembly</a>, Civicus draws attention to activists imprisoned because of their work as part of the <a href=\"http://www.civicus.org/csw/civilsocietybehindbars/4/441-csbb-uzbekistan-aug08\">Civil Society Behind Bars campaign</a>. This year, the case of <a href=\"http://www.savebinayak.ukaid.org.uk/\">Dr Binayak Sen</a>, vice-president of the <a href=\"http://www.pucl.org/\"> People's Union for Civil Liberties</a>, one of India's most well-respected human rights groups was highlighted before the international community. Sen, detained since May 2006, has <a href=\"http://www.pucl.org/Topics/Human-rights/2006/slawajudum.htm\">worked to expose</a> extrajudicial killings by the police and excesses committed by Salwa Judum, the government sponsored militia in the conflict-ridden state of Chhattisgarh. He stands accused of passing messages to Naxal/Maoist insurgents in prison whom he used to visit as part of his civil society work. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chhattisgarh_Special_Public_Security_Act\">Chhattisgarh Special Public Security Act</a>, one of the laws under which Sen is charged, contains an overbroad definition of what constitutes an unlawful activity, which can be conveniently invoked to clamp down on the freedom of expression and journalists' rights. Draconian punishment of up to seven years' imprisonment is prescribed under the law for uttering words, writing or making visual representations that create \"risk or danger for public order, peace or public tranquillity\". Moreover, any organisation can be declared unlawful by issuing a government notification. Although, the government is obliged to specify the reasons for declaring an organisation unlawful, it may dispense with this requirement if, in its opinion, it is against the public interest to do so. In May 2008, <a href=\"http://www.releaseajaytg.in/\">Ajay TG</a>, another leading civil liberties activist and journalist who has made a number of films around the themes of poverty and human rights violations was arrested under this law for making contact with an unlawful organisation because he wrote a letter to Maoist insurgents requesting return of his camera, which had been snatched by them on one of his field trips. That the grounds of his arrest were flimsy is borne out by the fact that despite the passage of three months, the police were unable to collect enough evidence to file charges against Ajay, leading to his automatic release on bail on August 5 this year. </p> <p>Although the cases against Sen and Ajay are still pending, a debate on the utility of draconian laws enforced in the name of \"protecting\" the Indian state is long overdue. Proponents of these laws often argue that the country is in the grip of multiple insurgencies seeking to dismember the country, which has also been the target of both indigenous and global terrorist networks. Most civil society groups wholeheartedly agree that terrorism in all it forms must be resolutely countered, but the means employed by constitutional democracies must not violate the core rights and freedoms that are the bedrocks of their society. Only if the means are just can governments hope to defeat those who employ terrorist tactics, while also encouraging disaffected peoples to join the democratic political process.</p>",
  "<p>A few weeks ago, I was forwarded an email from <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article992717.ece\">Palipehutu-FNL</a>, the Hutu-extremist group that murdered <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/dec/30/world\">my sister Charlotte</a>, back in December 2000. Even in translation, the triumphal tone seems clear:</p> <blockquote> <p>This morning [Palipehutu-FNL leader] Rwasa Agathon and I met the British ambassador in Burundi \u2026 In the course of our conversations and beside his congratulations on the fact that Rwasa Agathon had decided to return to Bujumbura, we were able to talk about the case in question \u2026 he understood well what we said but he suggested that we should make the necessary contacts in order that the brother of Charlotte would withdraw his complaint and he promised us that this was possible. According to the ambassador, the worries that the UK had about Palipehutu-FNL were a thing of the past and he promised to work with us towards a definitive end to this process.</p> </blockquote> <p>When I contacted the Foreign Office, they quickly admitted that a meeting had taken place \u2013 though their account was somewhat different: </p> <blockquote> <p>The ambassador said that we believed that P-NFL [sic] militiamen were responsible and the culprits need to be identified and brought to justice. Agathon Rwasa agreed that the case needs to be investigated. The ambassador stated that Charlotte's murder was a special case due to its unpleasant and unnecessary nature and needs to be resolved otherwise it would remain a \"stone in the shoe\" in the UK and Burundi relationship.</p> </blockquote> <p>Whatever the truth about who said what, simply securing an audience with the UK ambassador seems to have been a major coup for a group trying \u2013 at least for the moment \u2013 to shake off a bloody reputation, and bolster its domestic credibility. </p> <p>Alongside the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanic_Express_massacre\"> massacre</a> in which Charlotte and 20 of her fellow bus passengers \u2013 mostly Rwandan and Burundian Tutsis \u2013 were shot, Palipehutu-FNL is implicated in many <a href=\"http://www.news24.com/News24/Africa/News/0,,2-11-1447_1819911,00.html\">other killings</a>, numerous acts of torture, and the widespread use of <a href=\"http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2008-05/2008-05-03-voa13.cfm?CFID=29180736&amp;CFTOKEN=67256710\">child soldiers</a>. But the group's most notorious atrocity to date was the August 2004 <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/3564358.stm\"> Gatumba massacre</a>, where they shot, hacked and burned to death at least 156 Congolese Tutsi refugees, many of them children. </p> <p>After Gatumba, the FNL took the unusual step of admitting responsibility, <a href=\"http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/anctoday/2004/text/at33.txt\">reportedly declaring</a> that they had no fear of being held to account because they had become untouchable. They've since modified this position slightly, continuing to admit involvement but insisting that the UNHCR refugee camp was actually a military base, and that the refugees had attacked them first. The harrowing video footage I sat through at a <a href=\"http://blogs.amnesty.org.uk/blogs_entry.asp?eid=1794\">commemoration event</a> last weekend, filmed in the immediate aftermath of the attack, answers that claim more eloquently than words ever could.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.radionetherlands.nl/currentaffairs/region/africa/bur040824.html\">Public promises</a> of justice for Gatumba fell silent after FNL leader Agathon Rwasa called a press conference in Tanzania in April 2005, declaring his intention to talk peace. Within weeks, the FNL were back on the streets <a href=\"http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/RWB.NSF/db900SID/EVOD-6DFGSU?OpenDocument\">killing people</a> \u2013 but, a cynic might say, they had achieved their main objective. A UN investigation faltered. Diplomatic moves to refer Gatumba to the international criminal court came to nothing. Simply by waving the \"peace\" card, Rwasa had killed off any serious attempt to bring him to book for his crimes. </p> <p>The British government has largely, until now, shunned the FNL over its ongoing campaign of war crimes and crimes against humanity \u2013 and its involvement in the death of a UK citizen. The last time we really pushed the issue (May 2005), the Foreign Office told us that:</p> <blockquote> <p>We will continue to resist any moves to grant Rwasa or other FNL leaders immunity \u2026 We are clear that breaking the culture of impunity in the region is key to peace in the Great Lakes \u2026 If and when Rwasa and other FNL leaders return to Burundi we will push strongly for the Burundian authorities to try them as soon as possible for the crimes of which they have been accused.</p> </blockquote> <p>Amid great fanfare, the FNL leader <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7427154.stm\"> returned to Burundi</a> from exile in Tanzania \u2013 again \u2013 in May this year. Our first inkling that a UK government \"policy reappraisal\" was in the offing came in a letter from Africa minister Mark Malloch Brown, dated July 9. Brown told us that the Foreign Office was still committed to getting justice for my sister, but had nonetheless decided on a \"gradual re-establishment\" of relations with her killers. We now know that this letter was written a full week after the face-to-face meeting with the FNL leader had already taken place.</p> <p>It's unclear whether these latest efforts to shoehorn a deal will \u2013 even in the short-term \u2013 be any more successful than <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4550361.stm\"> previous initiatives</a>. But some analysts believe that the extremists may at last have decided to cut their losses and seek an agreement with the elected government \u2013 pushing, in the process, for as many political concessions as possible. These concessions include \u2013 naturally \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2008/05/mil-080507-irin02.htm\">blanket immunity</a> from prosecution. While the FNL continues to insist \u2013 in the face of clear evidence to the contrary \u2013 that they had nothing to do with Charlotte's death, the group's leaders also seem keen to ensure that this thesis can never be tested in a court of law.</p> <p>Seemingly emboldened by their increasing international acceptance, the FNL last week <a href=\"http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5i-Cf2sEC8c4lS-HdHfxo-NhAPmPQ\">upped their demands</a>. In exchange for disarming and demobilising their forces, the group now wants control of every key ministry in the government, including foreign affairs, the interior ministry and \u2013 ironically \u2013 the ministry of justice. </p> <p>It's difficult to see how acceding such demands will, in the long run, do anything but perpetuate Burundi's <a href=\"http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?reportid=47778\"> ongoing cycle</a> of corruption and <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org.uk/actions_details.asp?ActionID=412\">abuse</a>. But such concerns seldom seem uppermost in diplomatic minds when the international community is bestowing \"peace\" \u2013 real or imagined \u2013 on a troubled African nation. </p> <p>Notwithstanding their intention to \"make the necessary contacts in order that the brother of Charlotte would withdraw his complaint\", the FNL have not, as yet, been in touch with me directly. But I did recently get a message from someone calling himself Dieudonn\u00e9 Habarugira, who claimed to be a former Burundian diplomat. Haburagira offered to act as a neutral intermediary who could \"break the ice\" with the FNL, and asked me to travel to Brussels to meet him. </p> <p>A brief <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=dieudonne+habarugira&amp;sourceid=ie7&amp;rls=com.microsoft:en-US&amp;ie=utf8&amp;oe=utf8\">Google search</a> put me off that idea. Yet the fact that my sister's killers would go to these lengths suggests that her murder remains, at least, an inconvenience to them. </p> <p>As for the UK government, it's as difficult as ever to figure out their real intentions. But we've long known, both from our own experience and <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/ward-case-was-victim-of-clumsy-coverup-562312.html\">others</a> we've learned of over the years \u2013 that Foreign Office assurances to the families of Britons murdered overseas should be taken with a heavy dose of scepticism.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> London. <br> <strong>The lineup:</strong> Jim Eliot (synths) and Mima Stilwell (vocals). <br> <strong>The background:</strong> Now that Goldfrapp have gone all floaty and pastoral on the nation's ass, there's a gap in the market for a boy-girl duo making sultry, sassy electro-pop with 80s rock flourishes. You'll already have heard of Kish Mauve because it was with their song 2 Hearts that Kylie Minogue staged her comeback and reached No 1 last year. And now they're hoping to have a hit themselves with another track that Kylie wanted for her album, X. You can see why. Lose Control is a far better song than 2 Hearts and would have made the perfect follow-up single, with its late 70s disco groove and insidiously rhythmic guitar line running throughout that recalls Chic or their rivals Change circa The Glow of Love and a superb Ernie Isley-ish solo at the end. It's got that great compressed sound you used to hear on all those French \"filter house\" records a few years back \u2013 the song's remixer Fred Falke is the musical other half of French disco supremo Alan Braxe. Not that Kylie feels too short-changed \u2013 short, yes \u2013 or hard-done-by because she's written a song herself for Kish Mauve's forthcoming debut album, Black Heart, called You Make Me Feel. Jim Eliot and Mima Stilwell, the duo behind Kish Mauve, call it a \"pop swap\". They should turn it into a TV show with Noel Edmonds as presenter.<br> Having one of your first songs covered by the Munchkin queen of Oz disco is the sort of stroke of good fortune most groups can only dream of. But Kish Mauve are all about the lucky break: they've had several of their tunes on the soundtrack to US TV series Dirty Sexy Money, Kate Moss has pouted along to their music on a Rimmel ad, last year every Sony Ericsson phone was pre-loaded with a previous single of theirs, Can't Get Enough, and the Dell computer firm used Kish Mauve's version of 2 Hearts.  They want to stress the seriousness of the venture, though \u2013 it's not just about exposure, it's about Art. Stilwell describes herself as \"a Joni Mitchell junkie\" who's also into Carole King, Suzanne Vega, Stevie Nicks \u2013 \"you know, emotional, kooky girl singers\". Eliot, who has been working with rock-disco likeminds Ladyhawke, is into krautrock and noise-pop and would like to imagine their music has a darkness about it, a melancholy quality, that elevates it above the level of fist-pumping techno pabulum. They've got Dave (Depeche Mode) Bascombe in to mix their album, and that makes sense: a lot of their stuff sounds like Violator-era Mode with a female singer cooing with cool dispassion over the top. Talking of which, they've just done a fab version of lost synth-pop classic I'm In Love With a German Film Star by a boy-girl duo called the Passions who reached No 25 in January 1981 and then mysteriously disappeared without trace.

  "<p>A multi-option referendum on Scottish independence could be supported by the Scottish Liberal Democrats if it included a question giving the devolved parliament greater powers, the party's new leader has indicated.</p> <p>Tavish Scott, who was elected the party's new leader today by a hefty margin, said he could try to use the proposed referendum in 2010 to give Scots another option: to strengthen the Scottish parliament's existing powers within the UK, short of independence.</p> <p>Scott became leader with almost 60% of the party membership's votes, outstripping his two rivals Ross Finnie, a former environment minister, and backbencher Mike Rumbles by more than two votes to one. </p> <p>The former Lib Dem deputy leader and MSP for Shetland said the result had given him a mandate to lead with \"renewed energy and vigour\". His party has slumped to fourth place in opinion polls and been repeatedly outflanked and overshadowed by the Scottish Tory party since the Holyrood elections in May 2007.</p> <p>Scott told senior party figures, including former Scottish leaders Jim Wallace and his immediate predecessor Nicol Stephen, that his first target would be Alex Salmond's Scottish National party administration. Salmond's opponents believe many of his party's policies and pledges are about to falter because of over-spending.</p> <p>\"After 18 months in government, the SNP are riding high. They're popular but here's my prediction: by 2010, they won't be,\" said Scott. \"You can already see the underlying weaknesses that will undo Alex Salmond. What looks like confidence, surefooted and wily today will seem arrogant, misguided and politically dishonest tomorrow. Spin is the hallmark of this government, but spin has a shelf life.\"</p> <p>Scott's key task is to rebuild the party's influence and stature at Holyrood, where it shared power with Labour in two successive coalition governments until May last year. </p> <p>Despite his confident rhetoric, there were heavy hints today that Scott intends to open talks with Salmond on joint policies, particularly a local income tax and perhaps a constitutional referendum. This would allow him to repeat Tory success in delivering new policies since the election.</p> <p>Salmond's plans for a local income tax have come under sustained attack from business leaders, economists and UK ministers, so Lib Dem support for scrapping the council tax could prove crucial for the SNP's minority government, which holds power on the slimmest of mandates.</p> <p>Scott's price for that could be holding a multi-option referendum on constitutional reform \u2013 a deal that Salmond has previously shown interest in. That could also attract Labour support, since pro-union parties insist the public would vote against full independence.</p> <p>Asked whether he still believed the Lib Dems should oppose the SNP's independence referendum \u2013 his \"red line\" position before last May's elections, Scott told reporters: \"We will see what legislation the SNP comes forward with. I am not intuitively against making sure that people have a choice and opportunity to vote on these things, but I believe it should be for a strengthened Scotland within the UK.\"</p> <p>Nick Clegg, the UK party's leader, said he was \"delighted\" that Scott had been elected. \"He will bring energy and enthusiasm to the role, taking the fight to the SNP and Labour right across Scotland,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Tavish will address the issues that matter most to the people of Scotland, not the narrow-minded squabbles of the nationalists and Labour.\"</p> <p>Scott said his leadership would begin tomorrow with a visit to Glenrothes, the Westminster seat left vacant by the death of the Labour MP John MacDougall. </p> <p>The byelection date has yet to be set, but the Lib Dems said their candidate would be Harry Wills, a local businessman. Labour is due to unveil its candidate next Monday. The byelection is expected to be one of the fiercest fought for some time because it could determine the fate of Gordon Brown's government. </p> <p>It is the neighbouring seat to Brown's constituency of Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath. And while the SNP are already favourites to win, the Lib Dems still hope to repeat their shock result in 2006 when they beat Labour in Dunfermline and West Fife, the once rock solid Labour seat on the other side of Brown's constituency.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on Friday August 29 2008. We have added a paragraph, including a quote from Tavish Scott, to support the assertion that Scott's party may support a multi-option referendum on Scottish independence.</p>",
  "<p>Estate agents, surveyors and solicitors have joined forces to slam <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/homeinformationpacks\">home information packs</a> (Hips) as \"unfit for purpose\".</p> <p>The collection of trade bodies have complained that consumers could be asked to pay twice for searches because of the six-month shelf life of the packs - many are going out of date before properties are sold in the current slow market.</p> <p>The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) is calling on the government to get the \"right information to the right person at the right time.\"</p> <p>The rallying cry for reform comes as the industry consults on government changes to the packs, which currently include energy performance certificates and water and land searches among other voluntary documents.</p> <p>Among the proposed reforms is dispensing with the rule that sellers must commission a Hip before putting a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/property\">property</a> on the market, and removing the land registry searches.<br> The creation of a modular home condition report, separate to the survey, is also proposed.</p> <p>Gillian Charlesworth, Rics' director of external affairs, said: \"There is a theory that most transactions fall down because of a lack of information, but more often it is the buyer changing his or her mind or a change in circumstances.\"</p> <p>She added that the market is currently in an extremely low state and the trade bodies are seeking to reduce costs and duplication in the housing market.</p> <p>The lobbying group, which also includes the National Association of Estate Agents (NAEA) and the Law Society, put together the proposals and divided the legal information from what it calls the \"consumer\" information.</p> <p>Rics said the latter should include the solicitor's questionnaire, including details such as the length of lease, the availability of parking or whether the property has ever been flooded. This should not be confused with a property valuation or survey, it added.</p> <h2>Impact assessment</h2> <p>It became mandatory for all home sellers to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/jul/30/communities.money\">offer prospective buyers a Hip</a> from December 14 2007.</p> <p>A government consultation has already been launched to monitor the impact of the packs and is set to report in October.</p> <p>Hips remain a political hot potato, but were designed to give clarity and transparency to the buying and selling process, and cut the number of transactions that collapse.</p> <p>Mike Ockenden, director general of the Association of Home Information Pack Providers, said Hips have cross-sector support and those looking for changes are only protecting their own interests.</p> <p>\"There are five separate industries who are all making good money from the existing broken-down house buying and selling process. This is a thinly veiled attempt to keep things as they always were,\" he said.</p> <p>A communities and local government spokesman said: \"Hips are already bringing benefits to consumers by providing important information to help families cut their fuel bills and carbon emissions, and have reduced the price of property searches by increasing transparency in the homebuying and selling process.\"</p> <p>The spokesman added: \"We are continuing to work with stakeholders, including the NAEA, to consider how the process can be improved further, including through enhancing the Hip.\"</p>",

  "<p>Anyone interested in understanding the government's approach to youth justice should check out the online version of the arcade game, <a href=\"http://www.bobsspaceracers.com/frames/playagame.htm\">Whac-a-mole</a>. Fairly self-explanatory, the aim of the game is to thump emerging moles into their holes with a large hammer. Much like the youth justice system, the point is not to address the root cause of the problem, but to hit the re-emerging offenders as many times as possible in order to score the maximum number of points (read: government targets).</p> <p>This criticism of the judicial system has been made by the ex-Youth Justice Board chairman, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6302011.stm\">Rod Morgan</a>. In a <a href=\"http://www.crimeandjustice.org.uk/prsummaryjustice.html?search_string=Rod%20Morgan\">report</a> for Kings College, Morgan argues that young people are being criminalised by a police force under pressure to hand out more and more cautions for less and less sinister offences \u2013 a trend that helps to explain why the number of under-18s dealt with by the judicial system has risen by more than a quarter since 2002.</p> <p>Treating petty offences as criminal acts brands young people as lawbreakers, wastes police time and distracts resources from more serious affairs. A far better approach, as recently suggested by the <a href=\"http://www.libdems.org.uk/justice/liberal-democrats-outline-youth-crime-proposals.14915.html\">Lib Dems</a>, would be to deal with minor offences in the community. They have proposed a system of community panels, whereby young offenders would be required to appear before local people, apologise in person, and pay the cost in a way that forces them to acknowledge the consequences of their behaviour. They might, for example, have to scrub off the graffiti they've sprayed, or do the shopping for the elderly person they've robbed. Labour ministers have dismissed this proposition as a \"soft option\", but having to look your victim in the eye and publicly acknowledge your behaviour is a lot more difficult than simply filling out your name and address for a bored policeman issuing yet another government caution.</p> <p>Dealing with sentences in the community has two other advantages over the government's current thwack-and-run approach. First, it works to promote a sense of empathy in offenders. Conscience is the best (and cheapest) safeguard against antisocial behaviour, and coming face-to-face with a victim helps offenders understand the effects of their actions \u2013 something that is too often left unacknowledged. Second, involving the community in coping with antisocial behaviour creates accountability. When local people know their younger neighbours, they can make sure that they don't slip off the radar. They can keep an eye on individuals who are continuing to cause trouble, and keep the other eye looking out for them if they're falling into the wrong crowd or need some support. These systems of accountability are what is needed to prevent reoffending, not a simplistic thwack on the wrist from the punitive hammer.</p> <p>Whac-a-mole might be an amusing game, but there is something sinister about the analogy. For many young people, simply raising their heads in the community is grounds for a thwack. In the last year we have seen a wave of policies penalising young people before they've committed an offence. Mosquitoes are punishing young people simply for \"hanging around\" public spaces. Blanket <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/curfew-calls-time-on-the-rowdy-youth-of-cornwalls-moss-side-877801.html\">curfews</a> are being imposed for youths on estates in Cornwall. Stop and search policies are on the increase, and they've even started in schools.</p> <p>Labour needs to acknowledge that this game isn't working, and the Conservatives need to realise that thwacking harder won't make any difference. The one space for praise is the Lib Dems. They alone have the courage to lay down their hammers and address the problems of antisocial behaviour alongside the communities it affects.</p>",
  "<p><br>Is it all too good behind the scenes for the Sugababes? Photograph: Martin Godwin</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmHrGwyYNBQ\">One listen to the Sugababes' new single</a> confirms all my suspicions. They've gone from an out there, edgy pop band to being as predictable as Atomic Kitten.</p> <p>Girls nicks its trumpets from Mark Ronson, its feminist message from Destiny's Child and its chorus <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmHrGwyYNBQ\">from a Boots advert</a>. It's the kind of assembly line, girl-band fodder that has seen them fade into the background while the likes of Girls Aloud take their place in the world of unpredictable, forward-thinking pop.</p> <p>So what's gone wrong?</p> <p>Well, with their famous conveyor-belt members policy (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmHrGwyYNBQ\">as parodied by Kevin Bishop</a>), you might think that they've valued the Sugababes \"brand\" above any quality control. Let's look at the evidence. There was Easy, the clunky single from their Greatest Hits album, written with members of be-hatted, cod-Chili Peppers wannabees Orson who at the time were riding high from their Number One No Tomorrow. Its misjudged sexiness made it about as come hither as a crusty old oven glove. Then there was their risible cover of Walk This Way with Girls Aloud for Comic Relief. The off-key singing, which barely managed to keep in time with the verses, felt like sitting through a karaoke endurance test.</p> <p>Although hugely successful, the first single from their next album Change, About You Now, was a cynical attempt to re-create a certain pop rock sound that had proved so successful in the charts. It was penned with writer/producer Dr Luke (responsible for Kelly Clarkson's Since U Been Gone and Avril Lavigne's Girlfriend amongst others). As for the album, it was a dull, unimaginative collection. A shuddering disappointment next to the titanic pop experimentation of Taller in More Ways.</p> <p>Where, we asked ourselves at the time, was the Numan splice-up of Freak Like Me, or the poised pop of Overload? But by now they seemed more concerned with their <a href=\"http://www.themillionsgroup.co.uk/Toy_Shop/Toys/Barbie/1816_L4497_Barbie_Doll:_Sugababes\">range of Mattel dolls</a> and their <a href=\"http://www.deichmann.com/sugababes/en/tv_spots.html\">brand of shoes</a>. Certainly the music that former members <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lMJW4V49Yc\">Mutya Buena</a> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D__RpB3pK68\">Siobhan Donaghy</a> made after their departures from the group, suggests that they took the creative spark with them.</p> <p>By all accounts, the famously feisty band seems to be on an even keel personality-wise with new member Amelle Berrabah. But perhaps their lacklustre form suggests intra-band tensions really do create the best music.</p>",
  "<p>There is bound to be cynicism about robots working in hospitals. The thought of scalpel-wielding robot doctors makes the blood run cold. But that's not what concerns Lord Winston in his new BBC1 series, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00d4nx7\">Superdoctors</a>. He worries about the doctor-patient relationship: \"I just feel that robotic nurses and robotic doctors are completely contrary to what medicine is about.\"</p> <p>His clearly made points about doctors' duty of care ring true. I agree that the sick and vulnerable need human contact. The touch and sound of a medic gives comfort and instils trust in patients. But Winston's analysis misses the massive future benefits that medical robots will provide for humanity.</p> <p>The programme begins on a ward round with the five-foot 200-pound Remote Presence robot. Instead of a head, it has a monitor showing a live doctor's face. The doctor, controlling it remotely, can talk to the patient and even read charts. While this seems oddly out of place in a London hospital, its future value for many is undeniable; think of large developing countries with a paucity of doctors. Many lives could be saved by giving the robots a few more simple abilities like measuring temperature, respiration, pulse-rate and blood pressure, combined with the watchful eye of a distant doctor. <a href=\"http://www.virgin-atlantic.com/en/gb/passengerinformation/inflighthealth/medicalfacilities.jsp\">Virgin Atlantic</a> is already equipping its entire fleet with this type of technology operating through an inflight phone.</p> <p>The potential benefits for disaster victims are enormous. Robots come in many different shapes. They can be snake-like, slithering through rubble checking for vital signs and delivering medicine; fish-like for floods, or flying to access mountains.</p> <p>The second half of Superdoctors dealt with two robot surgical assistants. First was a <a href=\"http://www.intuitivesurgical.com/products/index.aspx\">da Vinci robot</a>, the most widely used in the world, performing laparoscopic surgery on an infant. Second was a \u00a312m Canadian <a href=\"http://www.ucalgary.ca/news/uofcpublications/oncampus/online/may29-08/neuroArm\">neuroArm</a> assisting in the removal of a brain tumour. Unlike human surgeons, neuroArm can operate inside an MRI scanner to make brain surgery extremely accurate.</p> <p>This time the criticisms were that the instruments were too large, which is not hard to fix, and that human surgeons could have performed the operations just as well. Maybe so in these cases with the best surgeons, but extensive studies at Guy's Hospital in London, among others, have shown that robots significantly improve surgical accuracy, particularly among the less-skilled.</p> <p>The point missed here was that rapid technological developments will make these systems cheaper, smaller, smarter and portable. Imagine the lives saved by a portable robot surgeon rushed to a motorway accident, or to a nuclear accident, a battlefield or to any disaster where one surgeon could carry out several procedures at the same time with help from medical assistants at the scene. </p> <p>The near-future will see many improvements on the road to achieving a truly portable robot doctor-surgeon. Long-distance surgery has already been successfully trialled between the US, France and Italy. Help could come from recent developments in military robotics to provide highly reliable communication between doctor and machine. And new work on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haptic\">force feedback</a> for soldiers controlling bomb-disposal robots could give the surgeon a virtual sense of touch inside a patient.</p> <p>Lord Winston concludes, \"I hate the idea of the surgeon being removed from the patients.\" But surely distant control is the biggest advantage of using robots. Human contact is certainly important in medical treatment but it can come from other carers at the site.</p>",
  "<p>The scale of <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/politics/gordonbrown\">Gordon Brown</a>'s challenge in wooing back <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour\">Labour</a> supporters was made clear today in a poll which revealed that most of the public blames the government for the economic downturn. </p> <p>The poll was published as a group of Labour MPs urged the prime minister to impose a one-off levy on energy and utility companies to help Britons meet the cost of soaring fuel bills.</p> <p>More than three-quarters of respondents to an FT/Harris poll believe Brown's government is at least partly to blame for the downturn, with 56% believing ministers bear \"a lot\" or \"complete\" responsibility for the situation. </p> <p>Just 3% of respondents rated the government's handling of the downturn and its consequences as \"good\", and more than a quarter of respondents who had always voted for Labour said they were somewhat or much less likely to do so in the future. </p> <p>Seventy per cent of respondents said their economic wellbeing had become worse during the past year, with only 5% reporting an improvement, according to the FT poll. </p> <p>More than 70 MPs have added their names to a petition organised by Compass, the centre left pressure group, calling for a windfall tax on fuel in a bid to help restore Labour's popularity with voters. </p> <p>The petition says that a share of the profits made this year by the main energy providers \u2013 up from \u00a3557m in 2003 to \u00a33bn this year \u2013 should be \"ring-fenced to deliver social and environmental justice for all\". </p> <p>Compass spokesman Gavin Hayes said: \"[A windfall tax on energy companies] is exactly the sort of thing we need to kick-start Labour's revival in the polls.\"</p> <p>The list of signatories includes three parliamentary private secretaries \u2013 unpaid ministerial assistants - marked out because they don't usually add their names to petitions. <br> A further seven ministerial aides have declined to publicly add their names to the list but have privately confided to Compass they fully support a windfall tax as part of a package of measures reportedly being prepared by the government to help vulnerable households hit by rising fuel costs. </p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/aug/24/energy.economy\">YouGov poll commissioned by Compass and the Observer</a> over the weekend showed that 67% of Britons \"strongly agreed\" or \"agreed\" that a one-off tax should be levied on oil and gas companies.</p> <p>Rob Marris, PPS to Shaun Woodward, the secretary of state for Northern Ireland, said he would not sign the petition but backed the proposal.</p> <p>Marris said: \"The government needs a change of policy not a change of leadership and I am confident that the government will this autumn come up with policies this country needs.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/person/0,,-2563,00.html\">Lindsay Hoyle</a>, Labour MP for Chorley, said a windfall tax would be a way to curb the \"immoral\" and \"excessive\" profits of energy companies.</p> <p>Hoyle, a long-standing campaigner for a windfall tax, said Conservative and Labour governments had both used windfall taxes in the past as a way to control such profits in other industries. </p> <p>\"There is nothing new in it,\" he told BBC Radio 4's The World At One. \"It has been used as a measure and a pressure to companies that feel they can charge what they want and make excessive profits.</p> <p> \"I have no problem with companies making profits. These are excessive profits, these are immoral profits. It isn't good enough and we have got to take action now.\" </p> <p>David Kidney, ministerial aide to transport minister Rosie Winterton, has not signed the petition but has written to the chancellor, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/alistairdarling\">Alistair Darling</a>, asking him to put tackling fuel poverty at the heart of his pre-budget report. </p> <p>Kidney, MP for Stafford, told the programme: \"We have already a fuel poverty reduction strategy. It's going off-target because of these big rises in energy bills so what I want the chancellor to do is make this the centrepiece of his pre-budget report.</p> <p>\"It may mean, of course, more public spending and so obviously it's the chancellor's responsibility to find out then how he's going to be able to pay for it.\" </p> <p>He added: \"But it doesn't necessarily mean a windfall tax - there are other ways of being able to provide the money for this energy action.\"</p>",

  "<p>French air safety authorities are investigating what caused a Ryanair 737-800 jet carrying 168 passengers to lose cabin pressure while it was 30,000ft over France. </p> <p>Officials from the Paris-based BEA are going over the aircraft at Limoges international airport. It has been suggested that a faulty air valve may be involved. </p> <p>Air is sucked into the cabin by the engines and its flow is regulated by an outflow valve. If the air supply is disrupted by a malfunctioning valve or a hole in the aircraft, the pilot has only a short time to bring the plane down to an altitude where the air is breathable \u2014 around 8,000ft.</p> <p>It was this rapid, controlled descent in response to a cockpit warning signal that led some passengers on board flight FR9336 from Bristol to Barcelona Girona to believe that the aircraft was plunging to the ground as freezing air whistled through the cabin. </p> <p>\"One thing that can happen is that the outflow valve can fail and become open, so all the air will rush out,\" said David Learmount, the operations and safety editor of Flight International magazine. </p> <p>He said pressurisation failures were \"not rare\" and were inevitable in an industry that carries 2.25 billion people per year. Wear and tear was another possible cause, he said, as cracks in an aircraft fuselage could let air out.</p> <p>\"A hole can appear because some damage was done which nobody notices and, because of the constant stress of pressurising and depressurising the cabin, it becomes bigger over time.\" </p> <p>Kieran Daly, the group editor of Air Transport Intelligence, said: \"You can have as little as 30 seconds of consciousness before it's all over.\"</p> <p>Michael O'Leary, the Ryanair chief executive, denied passenger claims that some onboard oxygen masks did not work. The airline said in a statement: \"Ryanair's engineers have inspected the aircraft overnight and have confirmed that the oxygen masks which deployed were working properly.\"</p> <p>The Dublin-based carrier said that the plane was five years old and was last serviced a month ago. The captain had flown with Ryanair for nearly six years and had more than 13,400 hours' flying experience. </p> <p>Concerns have been raised over pilot fatigue at Ryanair but safety experts say the airline has addressed them. O'Leary admitted to the Guardian last year that some \"jet jockey\" pilots employed by the airline had flouted guidelines and made dangerous landing approaches. </p> <p>\"What we had in these cases was jet jockeys deciding 'I am better than Ryanair SOPs [standard operating procedures]'. We don't want anybody doing that,\" he said. </p> <p>Ryanair's disaster contingency operation, to be used during serious incidents, has been described as \"very impressive\" by aviation professionals. Learmount said Ryanair's maintenance record was \"very good ... It has the youngest fleet of aircraft in Europe and their maintenance organisation is first class.\"</p> <p>Last month a Qantas Boeing 747-400 carrying 365 passengers and crew to Melbourne was forced to descend rapidly after an oxygen tank exploded and blew a hole in the fuselage. </p> <p>In 2005, a Helios Airways flight crashed outside Athens with the loss of 121 lives after a pressurisation control was left on manual and the plane, also a Boeing 737, failed to pressurise adequately. Greek air force pilots who shadowed the jet as it drifted on autopilot, with its crew and passengers apparently unconscious, reported seeing a flight attendant struggling with the controls shortly before it crashed.</p>",

No. He's involved in politics to elect Republicans who'll lay off his waste-dumping business. His interests have nothing to do with Bill Ayers or the Weather Underground, although I'd imagine he hates them. But he wants not to be regulated. That's what politics is about, from his point of view. It's a clearer-eyed understanding of the world than this mush about people's feelings and the Clintons being treated with \"respect.\"</p>",
  "<p>Chinese authorities could put the lovers, spouses and children of corrupt officials on trial under new rules, a state newspaper reported today.</p> <p>The draft law reflects the government's pledge to curb a growing cause of public resentment as well as the increasing sophistication of schemes to cream off public money or take bribes.</p> <p>\"Spouses and children of and/or people who have 'intimate relations' with corrupt officials could be jailed for more than seven years if they are found guilty of taking advantage of such officials' positions to get bribes or make money illegally,\" China Daily said.</p> <p>Almost all ministerial-level officials investigated by the country's senior prosecutions body have had at least one extramarital relationship, according to the paper. Most of the lovers used their relationships to make money illegally.</p> <p>Last year, a court in north China sentenced to death a former senior official who murdered his mistress with a car bomb after tiring of her demands for money.</p> <p>Hu Xingdou, an economics professor at the Beijing Institute of Technology, said corruption was becoming more serious. \"Officials are actually taking less money. This regulation aims to get rid of this concealed problem \u2014 the relatives of the official, and the improper transactions they participate in,\" he said.</p> <p>Hu said amending the law would help tackle the problem but that further measures were needed. He called for \"sunshine finance\", requiring officials to make their property details and income public, and said laws were needed to protect whistleblowers and allow citizens to sue corrupt officials.</p> <p>The draft law was submitted to the standing committee of the people's congress yesterday.</p> <p>China Daily said retired officials who used their influence to make money illegally could face punishment, and that officials who could not account for large assets would face up to 10 years in jail instead of the current five.</p> <p>Ren Jianming, director of the clean government research centre at Tsinghua University, told the paper that the maximum sentence should be raised even further, to 20 or 30 years.</p> <p>This month, a corrupt official from Chongqing who amassed \u00a31.7m in bribes was condemned to death after bad plumbing betrayed him.

  "<p>Russia has stepped up its defiance of the west by recognising the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, Georgia's two breakaway provinces.</p> <p>Less than three weeks after Russia and Georgia went to war over South Ossetia, Dmitry Medvedev, the Russian president, said in a televised announcement: \"I have signed decrees on the recognition by the Russian Federation of the independence of South Ossetia and the independence of Abkhazia.\"</p> <p>Georgia condemned Medvedev's declaration. \"This is an unconcealed annexation of these territories, which are a part of Georgia,\" said Giga Bokeria, the deputy foreign minister.</p> <p>Western leaders followed suit, with some of the strongest language coming from the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, who called it \"absolutely unacceptable\" but called for dialogue to be maintained with Russia. The US secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, said Russia's move was regrettable. She said Abkhazia and South Ossetia were part of Georgia \"and it will remain so\".</p> <p>The British foreign secretary, David Miliband, said Russian recognition of Georgia's breakaway regions was \"unjustifiable and unacceptable\". A Foreign Office spokesman said: \"We reject this categorically and reaffirm Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity. This is contrary to obligations that Russia has repeatedly taken on in [UN] security council resolutions. It does nothing to improve the prospects for peace in the Caucasus.\"</p> <p>France, which holds the rotating presidency of the EU, reiterated its commitment to Georgia's territorial integrity. It has called a meeting of EU leaders to discuss the crisis next Monday.</p> <p>There was jubilation in Abkhazia where people fired into the air, opened bottles of champagne and wept with joy. In Sukhumi, Abkhazia's capital on the Black Sea coast, office workers spilled into the streets moments after Medvedev made his announcement.</p> <p>\"We feel happy. We all have tears in our eyes. We feel pride for our people,\" Aida Gubaz, a 38-year-old lawyer, told Reuters. \"Everything we went through, now we are getting our reward.\"</p> <p>There were similar scenes in Tskhinvali, the capital of South Ossetia, where a Reuters photographer heard celebratory gunfire on the city's outskirts.</p> <p>Both houses of Russia's parliament yesterday unanimously adopted resolutions urging Medvedev to recognise the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, but the Russian government had been expected to move more cautiously. Some analysts thought Russia's preferred scenario was for the two provinces to eventually win Kosovo-style acceptance, rather than face an unresolved status like Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus.</p> <p>George Bush, the US president, yesterday expressed his deep concern at the parliamentary votes and urged the Russian government not to recognise the regions. The two provinces rebelled against Georgian rule after the collapse of the Soviet Union and have had de facto independence since the early 1990s.</p> <p>Russia's envoy to Nato, Dmitry Rogozin, compared the tension between Russia and the west to the eve of the first world war, saying a new freeze in relations was inevitable.</p> <p>\"The current atmosphere reminds me of the situation in Europe in 1914 ... when because of one terrorist, leading world powers clashed,\" Rogozin told the RBK Daily business newspaper. \"I hope Mikheil Saakashvili [the president of Georgia] will not go down in history as a new Gavrilo Princip.\" He was referring to the assassin of the Austro-Hungarian archduke Franz Ferdinand.</p> <p>The influential daily Kommersant ran as its front page headline \"Russia's leaders quarrel with the west\". Below was a photo of Medvedev taking aim with a Kalashnikov gun during a visit to a weapons factory this year.</p> <p>Two US warships are due to deliver humanitarian supplies tomorrow to the Georgian port of Poti, where hundreds of Russian troops are manning checkpoints in so-called security zones.</p> <p>\"At the request of the Georgian government, these ships will be delivering humanitarian aid to Poti,\" a spokesman for the US embassy said today. \"The USS McFaul and another US ship will dock in Poti on Wednesday.\"</p> <p>In another show of support for Georgia, the White House announced that Dick Cheney, the US vice-president and a critic of Russia, would visit Georgia next week as part of a trip to former Soviet states seeking closer links with the west.</p> <p>Tension remains high in Poti on the Black Sea coast as Russia has left many troops in place despite withdrawals from most of Georgia last week. Russian media reported that the guided missile cruiser Moskva, flagship of the Russian Black Sea fleet, put to sea again from its Crimean base for what the navy described as a routine training exercise to test weapons and onboard systems.</p> <p>Russia has pulled back most of its forces from Georgia proper but has angered the west by keeping troops in a large buffer zone around the two rebel regions, saying they are required as peacekeepers. The west says the size of the buffer zones violates the terms of a French-brokered ceasefire and has called on Russia to withdraw without delay.</p> <p>Georgian and Russian forces have been locked in a standoff in the village of Mosabruni near the edge of South Ossetia, about 30 miles north-west of the Georgian capital, Tbilisi.</p> <p>\"We are afraid our children will be killed,\" said a Georgian villager, Iza Mikhanishvili, 31. \"There are Georgian forces on one side, Ossetians on the other. Yes, they are peacekeepers, but we are afraid every single night that something will happen. The only thing we want is peace. I don't care who we are with.\"</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-336974766\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p><br>Hecklers drowned out Zimbabwe's president, Robert Mugabe, as he opened parliament today with a speech accusing Britain and the US of using rising food prices to try to oust his regime.</p> <p>Opposition MPs - who outnumber members of Mugabe's ruling Zanu-PF party for the first time since the former British colony gained independence in 1980 - jeered and sang in protest at the failure to reach a power-sharing deal despite weeks of talks.</p> <p>As Mugabe talked of a \"vicious onslaught\" from international critics and accused them of trying to thwart efforts to import food, the opposition chanted \"Zanu is rotten\" and \"We have a pact with the people\".</p> <p>Power-sharing talks chaired by the South African president, Thabo Mbeki, have been deadlocked. The opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) had objected to Mugabe opening parliament but eventually agreed in a gesture that the MDC leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, said may help revive the talks.</p> <p>Mugabe, 84, told the parliament: \"Landmark agreements have been concluded, with every expectation that everyone will sign up.\"</p> <p>Tsvangirai won the first round of the presidential election but boycotted the run-off with Mugabe after a widespread campaign of state-sponsored intimidation and violence against MDC supporters.</p> <p>Despite the MDC's slim majority in the lower house, Zanu-PF has a majority in the upper house, the senate, which allows it to block legislation passed by MPs.</p> <p>The MDC yesterday landed a blow against Mugabe when its candidate, Lovemore Moyo, was elected to the influential position of parliamentary speaker.</p> <p>It is the first time since independence that the opposition has held the post, which is crucial because Moyo will now take charge of contentious debates in the hung parliament if no power-sharing deal is reached.</p> <p>Zanu-PF did not put up a candidate for speaker, instead backing Paul Themba Nyathi, who is from a splinter MDC faction headed by Arthur Mutambara.</p> <p>Zanu-PF holds 99 seats in parliament, while the breakaway MDC faction has 10. During the power-sharing talks it was assumed that Mugabe and Mutambara had reached an agreement to work together. </p> <p>That would have eclipsed the MDC, which has 100 seats, leaving Tsvangirai's party on the outer after he refused to accept a prime ministerial post answerable to Mugabe and with limited powers.</p> <p>Moyo's tally - he won by 110 votes to 98 - shows that numerous MDC-Mutambara MPs and perhaps even a few Zanu-PF members were willing to support Tsvangirai's party.</p>",
  "<p>Philippe Senderos is on the brink of joining former team-mate Mathieu Flamini at the San Siro after arriving in Milan for a medical. Having declined to comment on earlier reports that a move for the Arsenal defender was on the cards, Milan have confirmed that Senderos will undergo a check-up today, although there is no indication yet as to whether the deal will be a permanent transfer or a season-long loan.</p> <p>Senderos's Arsenal career has been blighted by a series of high-profile blunders, but the Swiss international will hope to capitalise on the perennial injury problems of Paolo Maldini and Alessandro Nesta to nail down a place in Milan's ageing back four. Should he succeed, it will represent a remarkable turnaround for a player who - despite impressing the <em>Rossoneri</em> hierarchy with his contribution to Arsenal's last 16 Champions League triumph over Milan last season - has struggled to fulfil the potential that persuaded Ars\u00e8ne Wenger to pay Servette \u00a32.5m for his services in June 2003.</p> <p>Adriano Galliani, the Milan chief executive, has no qualms about Senderos's ability to bolster the club's Serie A prospects, however. \"I believe Ancelotti has to be happy with our recruits, it is a squad for the scudetto\" said Galliani, who revealed that a back injury is likely to keep Senderos out of Sunday's league opener against Bologna. \"He has a little problem with his back but he has told me he will be ready in around 10 days.\" </p> <p>In the absence of Senderos, Arsenal will look to new recruit Mika\u00ebl Silvestre, who arrived at the Emirates last week following a surprise move from Manchester United, for central defensive cover to first-choice pairing Kolo Tour\u00e9 and William Gallas.</p> <p>\"Senderos has gone to Milan today and will complete a medical,\" said Wenger. \"At the moment, he does not get the games here, and so now he can play somewhere and remains in a top-level club. We have [Johan] Djourou, we have Kolo [Toure], we have Senderos, we have [Alex] Song, [William] Gallas and [Mikael] Silvestre now who can play centre-back so we have a congestion there. We want him to play without losing him.\"</p> <p>While Senderos is poised to leave the Emirates, Arsenal will welcome back talismanic midfielder Cesc F\u00e1bregas for tomorrow night's third round, second-leg Champions League qualifier against FC Twente.

  "<p><em>Hugh Jackson is reporting from Denver for the Nevada political blog <a href=\"http://www.lasvegasgleaner.com/\">Las Vegas Gleaner</a></em></p> <p>One of the non-Clinton storylines as the Democratic National Convention gets underway in Denver finds the Democrats really rather pleased with themselves over <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121963059704068069.html\">the gains the party is making</a> in traditionally Republican and mostly rectangularly-shaped states out West. Nevada, New Mexico, convention host Colorado, Montana - and even John McCain's very own adopted state of Arizona - could all be in play for Barack Obama this year.</p> <p>Some of the trends that help explain the region's shifting political dynamics were outlined during a briefing on Monday from a firm hired to help the Democrats become more competitive in the West. The usual suspects were trotted out: Rapid population growth generally, and among Latinos and younger college-educated whites in particular, is creating a more favorable Democratic demographic.</p> <p>But Andrew Myers, hired to analyse Western voting trends by the Democratic Western Majority Project, made a few points that don't always make into the standard issue, \"oh my, the West is changing\", narrative.</p> <p>For instance, attacking gay marriage - a staple GOP tactic in recent campaign cycles - has very little pull as an issue on \"pragmatic\" Westerners. Unless gay marriage is making the price of gas go up, people in the West don't really care, Myers said.</p> <p>Westerners also might be just a tad less obsessed about their guns then Republicans would have one believe. About 40% of people in the West are gun owners, and the more guns they own, they more likely they are to vote for John McCain, no matter how many houses he can't remember he owns.</p> <p>Most Western gun owners only have one or two weapons, however, and among those folks, Obama and McCain are polling in a dead heat, Myers said.</p> <p>And of particular note in a convention that thus far seems to be concerned with the question of what, exactly, the Democratic Party is going to do with the Clintons, Latinos strongly support Obama.</p> <p>Throughout the primaries, the nation's most active former first lady generally performed much better with Latino voters, including in Western battleground states where Latinos now comprise a quarter or more of the population.</p> <p>But in the four states of Arizona, Nevada, Colorado and New Mexico, Obama leads McCain in polling among Latinos, 64% to 25%. \"The myth about Latinos not supporting Obama is just that - a myth,\" Myers said.</p>",

But the Bush administration's \"too little, too late\" efforts are almost certain to collapse.</p> <p>As a sign of the pessimistic mood, Ahmed Qurei, the Palestinians' chief negotiator, sparked controversy with his threat that, if the Annapolis process fails to meet its deadline and deliver an independent Palestine by the end of 2008, \"We will call for the alternative solution for the Palestinian people and their leadership \u2013 that is a <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSLA58012320080810?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=topNews&amp;pageNumber=1&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0\">single bi-nationalist state</a>,\" he said. </p> <p>This stance is all the more surprising given that Abu Ala, as he is more popularly known, was one of the chief architects of the Oslo accords and one of the most prominent Palestinian advocates of the two-state solution. If he, too, has lost hope in the oxymoronic \"peace process\", then what chance is there that a workable resolution will come to pass?</p> <p>The remark was widely criticised in Israel. \"Inevitably, the vast majority of Jewish Israelis will view any talk about a one-state solution as a threat \u2013 even as an existential threat,\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/13/israelandthepalestinians.middleeast\">Petra Marquardt-Bigman</a> wrote here on Cif.</p> <p>The veteran peace activist <a href=\"http://zope.gush-shalom.org/home/en/channels/avnery/1219526051/\">Uri Avnery</a> fears that putting the bi-national solution on the table would unleash widespread panic in Israel and leave the settler movement with a free hand to accelerate their settlement activity and push for \"transfer\". \"The real choice is, therefore: the 'two-state solution' or the 'ethnic-cleansing' solution,\" he warned.</p> <p>This is highly unlikely alarmism, as most Israelis can tolerate a low-intensity conflict, but any attempt to ethnically cleanse the Palestinian territories would meet with such domestic and international outrage that it would galvanise the Israeli moderates out of their stupor and run the risk of international intervention or, at the very least, make Israel's international isolation complete. </p> <p>Besides, revisionist and religious Zionists, who seem to hold the balance of power, believe that the Jewish identity of the land is more important than the Jewish identity of the population. That is why, in December 1977, unwilling to cede control of the West Bank and Gaza as part of a comprehensive peace deal being offered by Egypt, Menachem Begin drafted an autonomy plan, which was later shelved, which offered the Palestinians in the occupied territories Israeli citizenship and the right to purchase land and settle in Israel.</p> <p>On the Palestinian side, the reaction has been divided. Fatah's main political rival, Hamas, has <a href=\"http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-08/11/content_9181835.htm\">roundly condemned</a> Abu Ala's idea, and effectively accused the Palestinian Authority of collaboration and of selling out the Palestinian cause.</p> <p>Some, particularly <a href=\"http://without-a-roadmap.blogspot.com/2007/05/wheres-security-in-that.html\"> secular activists</a>, favour the switch in strategy and others fear that it might set back their cause. \"In spite of eloquent and articulate views and analyses by Palestinian intellectuals,\" observes <a href=\"http://www.palestinechronicle.com/view_article_details.php?id=14088\">Ghassan Khatib</a>, the vice-president of Bir Zeit University: \"the vast majority of the public, according to public opinion polls, and the majority of the political elite consider the idea of a bi-national state a dangerous alternative strategy.\"</p> <p>Personally, I think Qurei may be on to something, if approached correctly. Both the two-state and bi-national solutions seem like distant and utopian possibilities at the moment. Just as Israel is talking about a \"shelf agreement\" until they deem the Palestinians ready for peace, it is time for the Palestinians to shelve their aspirations for nationhood until the time is ripe. </p> <p>This means that they should temporarily abandon their national struggle and, instead, campaign for their civil rights, leaving the complexion of an eventual resolution to a more amenable future or more visionary leadership.</p> <p>When the Annapolis talks were launched, I did not hold out much hope that they would succeed and proposed that, if they fail, the Palestinians, and the Israeli peace movement, should launch a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/nov/19/acivilsolution\">civil rights movement</a>.</p> <p>At the time I wrote: </p> <blockquote> <p>The Palestinians cannot continue to live in such dire conditions for much longer in the vain hope of fulfilling their national aspirations. There must come a time when they decide that individual dignity is more important than the deceptive trappings of nationhood.</p> </blockquote> <p>Unlike the Palestinians who fell within Israel's 1948 borders and obtained citizenship and equal civil rights, the Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza have been disenfranchised for four decades. However, as long as Israel controls the territory on which they live, it is obliged to grant them their civil rights. </p> <p>Moreover, the bread-and-butter issues of civil liberties \u2013 such as freedom of movement, the right to live in security and safety, the right to education and employment, the right to vote, the right to citizenship \u2013 are issues that can be tackled one at a time and in an incremental fashion. </p> <p>They are also more concrete and pressing than the elusive notion of nationhood, and easier to build public sympathy for. \"We want the right to visit our families in other villages and towns \u2026 We want the right to work,\" are demands that tap into people's common humanity, rather than their nationalistic differences.</p> <p>Sari Nusseibeh, the progressive president of Al-Quds University in Jerusalem, has <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1011859.html\"> suggested</a> that the holy city could be the launch pad for such a civil rights movement, if its Palestinian residents reverse their boycott of the city's municipal elections and run their own candidates.</p> <p>By striving for their civil rights through the political process and non-violent activism the Palestinians, as Nusseibeh puts it, can turn their weakness into strength.</p>",
  "<p>Campaigners today called for tighter controls on airguns as a toddler who was shot in the head with his father's rifle remained critically ill in hospital.</p> <p>Rashid Rullah was shot by his five-year-old sister, who picked up the gun their father was using for target practice when he turned his back to answer his mobile phone.</p> <p>The family were in the back garden of their home in Washwood Heath, Birmingham, when the accident happened at 7pm on Sunday. Rashid remains unconscious in the city's children's hospital.</p> <p>The Gun Control Network, which campaigns for tighter controls on guns of all types, said: \"The tragic shooting of the toddler highlights once again the terrible consequences of the boys' toys culture surrounding airgun ownership.</p> <p>\"This culture results in easy access, casual regard and non-accountability. Because airguns are not treated as real weapons they are not thought worthy of registration or regulation. </p> <p>\"They are not taken seriously. The adults who own these guns are rarely held to account. There is no law requiring them to store their weapons safely nor is there any record of ownership.\"</p> <p>Airguns were responsible for half of all firearms offences and caused more than a quarter of all serious firearms injuries, the group said. </p> <p>The father of 12-year-old Mitchel Picken, who was killed in 2006 as his friends played with an air weapon, supported the call. \"The government cannot hide behind recent changes in legislation, which failed to take the airgun problem seriously enough and make owners responsible for storing their weapons safely,\" said Andrew Picken.</p> <p>\"Airguns and their owners could be registered, and they should be.\" </p> <p>Rashid's father, Bakht Zaman, a 29-year-old handyman, had just reloaded the airgun when he was distracted by his mobile phone. He put down the gun and when he turned his back to answer the call, his daughter grabbed the weapon, pointed it at her brother and shot him, said the children's grandfather, Bakht Rammand. </p> <p>\"Rashid's sister got hold of the gun and pointed it at her brother. He was on the high ground and she was on the low ground. It hit him right in the middle of the back of his head. Everybody's in shock,\" said Rammand, 48. </p> <p>Detective Inspector Simon Vowles, of West Midlands police, said investigators had yet to establish exactly what had happened but believed the shooting had been a \"tragic accident\".</p> <p>Most airguns do not require a firearms certificate but since October 2007 it has been illegal to sell an airgun to anyone under 18. </p> <p>It is an offence to carry an airgun in a public place.</p>",
  "<p>Police arrested more than 300 people at this year's Notting Hill carnival during a crackdown on violent gangs.</p> <p>Knives, a Taser gun and a baseball bat were among weapons seized by officers aiming to prevent a repeat of violence that has dogged the weekend-long west London event for years.</p> <p>Last night, police fought a two-hour running battle with about 40 youths after the end of the carnival. Troublemakers threw bottles and bricks at dozens of riot police who struggled to contain the disorder.</p> <p>Chief Inspector Jo Edwards, of the Metropolitan police, said today: \"It's disappointing that each year we see a small minority of mainly young men who don't come to the carnival until later. </p> <p>\"They don't come to enjoy the floats and the music; they come to fight and commit acts of violence.</p> <p>\"For two hours our officers came under attack from bottles, bricks and any debris that was on the ground. </p> <p>\"These people are intent on fighting but innocent members of the public get caught up in it and their carnival is spoiled.\"</p> <p>Police made 330 arrests within the Notting Hill area during the carnival, which was attended by about 850,000 people. Last year, 246 people were arrested.</p> <p>Authorities said another 151 people were prevented from reaching the site after a planned police swoop on organised gangs gathering at the Oval, south London.</p> <p>Edwards said officers acted on information to confront the gangs at 4.20pm yesterday. \"We had intelligence to suggest that people at the Oval were from a variety of gangs and that they were on their way to the carnival to commit crime, engage in disorder and potentially violence,\" she said.</p> <p>\"Some members were arrested for substantial offences such as possession of weapons. Others were detained to prevent a further breach of the peace.\" </p> <p>Edwards said teams of specialist dog handlers worked with the RSPCA to seize 21 dangerous dogs taken to the carnival in response to concerns raised after last year's event.</p>",
  "<p>Nothing could better illustrate the Republican party's contempt for feminists than its current, risible attempts to pander to them. When news broke on Saturday that Barack Obama had chosen Joe Biden as his running mate, GOP mouthpiece William Kristol, a longtime anti-feminist Hillary-hater, had a touching change of heart. On the website of the conservative Weekly Standard, he posted a little squib titled <a href=\"http://www.weeklystandard.com/weblogs/TWSFP/2008/08/kristol_the_democrats_glass_ce.asp\">\"The Democrats' glass ceiling\"</a>, which bemoaned the disrespect Obama ostensibly showed Clinton - and the cause of gender equality - by not choosing her as his vice-presidential nominee.</p> <p>\"So Hillary Clinton gets about 18 million votes in 2008, and isn't even considered for - she apparently isn't even given the courtesy of being consulted - the vice-presidential pick,\" he began. Then, continuing with preposterous faux umbrage: \"Will the Democratic party, which is committed (to say the least) to gender equity, and which in fact has a 50% quota for female delegates, accept Obama's imposition of a glass ceiling at its convention?\"</p> <p>The next day, clearly hoping to exploit the well-publicised disappointment of some women at Clinton's loss, McCain put out <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NrQ36Djf2E&amp;feature=related\">an ad echoing Kristol</a>. Over pensive, minor-chord music, a female voice says, her voice rising in incredulity: \"She won millions of votes \u2026 but isn't on his ticket! And why? For speaking the truth.\" The spot then runs through clips of a few of Clinton's attacks on Obama - all of which were, of course, reason enough for him not to want to partner with her, but are now being presented as the brave voice of a woman scorned by a sexist party for her candour.</p> <p>In all likelihood, the McCain operation is in fact heartily disappointed that Clinton will not be on the ticket, since her rhetoric during the primary, far more than Biden's, offered such a rich source of attack ad-ready anti-Obama soundbites. The new ad is a last-ditch way to take advantage of a few of the Clinton barbs that, had Obama chosen her, we'd be seeing in a constant loop until November. But it is also, clearly, an effort to play to her disaffected supporters.</p> <p>On Monday, the <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0808/12791.html\">McCain campaign released a second pro-Hillary spot</a>, this one featuring Wisconsin Clinton delegate Debra Bartoshevich looking into the camera and explaining that in the general election: \"In a first for me, I'm supporting a Republican \u2026 . A lot of Democrats will vote McCain. It's OK, really!\"</p> <p>Republicans, obviously, are hoping against hope that angry women make a spectacle of themselves at the Democratic convention. If <a href=\"http://www.puma08.com/\">Puma</a>, the self-satirising group of Hillary diehards (the acronym stands for \"Party unity up my ass\") didn't exist, Republican dirty tricksters would have to invent it. Indeed, the vaguely sexist name, which seems to allude to the sexually aggressive middle-aged women mockingly known as cougars, suggests the handiwork of someone having a laugh at the expense of broken-hearted second-wave feminists. </p> <p>Which is, of course, exactly what the Republicans are now doing. Kristol's disdain for Clinton - not to mention liberal women generally - has always been relentless. When she was the frontrunner during the Democratic primaries, Kristol penned numerous columns <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/28/opinion/28kristol.html\">excoriating her</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/11/opinion/11kristol.html\">ladled patronising praise on Obama</a>. When Clinton came in third in the Iowa caucuses, he wrote a Weekly Standard editorial titled <a href=\"http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/014/550eztvl.asp\">\"Thank you, Iowa\"</a>, celebrating the triumph of Obama, \"the classiest candidate on the Democratic side\", over a woman he despises. \"Three weeks ago, we made the case that the country deserved to be liberated from the Clintons and their brand of politics,\" he wrote. \"We promised to be the first to say something we are not accustomed to saying to the Democratic party - thank you. So, to the Iowa Democrats and independents who caucused in such numbers for Obama and even \u2013 this hurts \u2013 for Edwards, we say: Thank you. You have begun the job.\"</p> <p>There's something astonishing, almost impressive, in Kristol's audacious hypocrisy. It is as if McCain chose a pro-choice running mate, and Gloria Steinem starting lamenting the candidate's indifference to the rights of the unborn. </p> <p>McCain, of course, is no more a feminist than Kristol. His voting record is overwhelmingly <a href=\"http://www.ontheissues.org/2008/John_McCain_Abortion.htm\">anti-abortion</a>, and he <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/04/23/mccain-opposes-equal-pay-_n_98342.html\">opposed the Ledbetter Fair Pay Act</a>, which would have helped protect women from being paid less for doing the same job as men (what women need, McCain said, is <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/2008/04/23/mccain-dismisses-equal-pay-legislation-says-women-need-more-training-and-education/\">\"education and training\"</a>, implying they earn less because they're less qualified). He made vulgar jokes about Chelsea Clinton when she was just a child, and when his own wife teased him about losing his hair, he <a href=\"http://rawstory.com/news/2008/McCain_temper_boiled_over_in_92_0407.html\">reportedly shot back</a>: \"At least I don't plaster on the makeup like a trollop, you cunt.\" During the primary, when a supporter, speaking of Clinton, asked \"How do we beat the bitch?\" McCain <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20071114/mccain-clinton-comment/\">joined in the room's raucous laughter</a>, then replied \"That's an excellent question,\" before composing himself enough to offer some perfunctory words of respect for his putative presidential rival.</p> <p>Had Clinton in fact become the nominee, Republicans would now be giving Obama a tongue bath while trying to taint the Democratic party with racism. Meanwhile, there would be third-party ads painting Clinton as unstable virago, subject to hormonal mood swings and crying jags. After all, the same people who are now hymning Hillary spent years trying to destroy her. The fact that Republicans expect Clinton-supporting women to forget that is evidence that the party holds them in incredibly low regard. One has to hope that the majority of Democratic women will understand exactly who is really insulting them.</p>",
  "<p>Five British soldiers have been dismissed from the army after failing drugs tests, the Ministry of Defence said today. </p> <p>The soldiers, from the King's Troop, Royal Horse Artillery, were sacked after routine testing in their unit.

  "<p>Residents of a city in western Japan this week became the first to turn to the courts for help in ridding their neighbourhood of organised crime, amid fears that they will become the next victims of a violent power struggle.</p> <p>Around 600 residents of Kurume, in Fukuoka prefecture, have asked a local court to order members of the Dojinkai yakuza gang to vacate an office building in the middle of a busy shopping district.</p> <p>According to Japanese newspaper reports, the eviction attempt is the first by ordinary residents against an officially recognised crime syndicate.</p> <p>In their petition, the residents said the gang's activities and the ever-present threat of violence infringed on their constitutional right to live in peace.</p> <p>Their target is the head office of the Dojinkai, whose 1,000 members have controlled parts of south-west Japan since the late 1960s.</p> <p>The gang occupies three buildings near Kurume's main railway station, using one as its headquarters and letting the other two to affiliates.</p> <p>The residents say they risk becoming the innocent victims of an escalating conflict between the gang and the Kyushu-Seidokai, a splinter group formed after a bitter power struggle inside the Dojinkai in 2006.</p> <p>Since the start of the conflict, half a dozen mobsters, including the leaders of both gangs, and a bystander, have been shot dead, the Asahi Shimbun daily said. Several dozen bullets have been fired at the Dojinkai's headquarters. Though police were stationed outside the building to deter further attacks, the residents say they have been living in fear since the patrols ended in June this year.</p> <p>Faced with the threat of violent retribution, few Japanese who live among gangsters in cities around the country have the stomach to take legal action against their unsavoury neighbours.</p> <p>In Kurume, however, 1,500 people living near the Dojinkai building, supported by a 380-strong team of lawyers, have signed a petition calling for the gang to be turfed out.</p> <p>But experts said their campaign stood little chance of success. \"Japanese law as it stands is on the side of the tenants [in this case, the Dojinkai],\" Jake Adelstein, a former police reporter for the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper and an authority on the yakuza, told the Guardian. \"Once someone moves into a building, it's very difficult to get them out.\"</p> <p>Typically, gangs move into premises they know are about to be auctioned off and then demand money from the new owners in return for agreeing to move out. Many simply end up staying.</p> <p>\"There's nothing illegal about simply being yakuza,\" Adelstein said. \"The court will be sympathetic, but as far as the law is concerned the yakuza are citizens with the same rights as other tenants.</p> <p>\"The Dojinkai are a particularly vicious group, certainly not as polished as others that prefer to stay out of the limelight. They may decide to move out to avoid any more bad publicity, but where would they go then?\"</p> <p>The move comes as the yakuza are expanding their sphere of influence to include real estate, the stock market and other legitimate businesses, in addition to traditional money-earners such as prostitution, drugs, extortion and gambling.</p> <p>And faced with dwindling financial spoils and police crackdowns on their traditional activities, powerful crime syndicates are engaged in a renewed struggle for money and influence.</p> <p>Last year saw a slew of shootings involving members of the Yamaguchi-gumi - Japan's biggest underworld organisation - and a rival gang as they battled for control of lucrative districts in Tokyo.</p> <p>The island of Kyushu, where the Dojinkai has its headquarters, is no stranger to yakuza violence. Last April a gangster fatally shot Iccho Ito, the mayor of Nagasaki in the island's northwest. The killer, Tetsuya Shiroo, described by police as a senior member of the Yamaguchi-gumi, was sentenced to death in May.</p> <p>The National Police Agency puts the number of full-time yakuza members at just over 40,000. If unregistered members and hangers-on are included, however, the number rises to over 80,000, about half of whom belong to the Yamaguchi-gumi.</p> <p>\"When you look at the numbers it's easy to see how influential they are,\" Adelstein said. \"The authorities here are tolerant of the yakuza - more than you would like them to be.\"</p>",
  "<p>China can't seem to do anything right. Despite the success of the Beijing Olympic Games, medals won and dives dived, people just won't shut up about Tibet, smog and human rights. Well, there's a new complaint to add to the list, and it's the most bizarre yet. Remember the national anthems played during the Games? Well, they were nicked, a Czech composer has alleged.</p> <p>In 2004, Peter Breiner arranged more than 200 national anthems for use at the Athens Olympic Games. Though some might think that a song's a song, in copyright terms an arrangement is an original work. What's more, Breiner shortened these anthems, in some cases, to their minute-long essences, or brought out different distinctive elements. </p> <p>Watching medal ceremonies in Beijing, Breiner and several other close listeners noticed a striking resemblance between the Chinese arrangements and Breiner's 2004 compositions. Or, more cuttingly, Breiner is \"100% positive\" that the Beijing Olympic Committee is using his work without attribution, permission or compensation, he told the Washington Post.</p> <p>Breiner's Athens anthems were released as an eight-volume set by the well-known Naxos label. And, indeed, Breiner and Naxos offered to license these recordings to the Beijing Olympics. \"They responded that they would make their own recordings with a Chinese orchestra,\" Breiner told the Post. </p> <p>The trouble is, there are quirks to Breiner's arrangements that are distinctive. His take on the American anthem, The Star-Spangled Banner, aroused considerable controversy in 2004, with a Wall Street Journal writer calling it a \"Europe-friendly version of the anthem\" that dulls \"the notion of the US as a chest-thumping, butt-kicking, jingoistic powerhouse\".</p> <p>And when it comes to the Beijing version of that same anthem, \"Breiner's basic conception of the whole piece [had] been copied,\" the Post alleges. \"The brass opening, the addition of strings when the opening melody repeats, the inclusion of complex bass lines in Measures 14 and 28, and the use of an archaic little cadence at the end of several phrases [were] all very particular to Breiner's original.\"</p> <p>Olympic organisers denied the allegations. \"We have not heard of Naxos,\" Sun Weide, deputy director for communications for the Beijing Olympics, told the Post. \"All the anthems and songs used at the Beijing Games were orchestrated by Chinese musicians.\"</p> <p>In other conversations with Breiner and Naxos, the Chinese gave different explanations for the arrangements' origins. Beijing said that they had been sent copies by the International Olympic Committee, or had just \"found them on the internet\", Naxos president Klaus Heymann said.</p> <p>Certainly, Olympic authorities may have just hired a Chinese musician to transcribe Breiner's arrangements from CD. But the legal twists and turns are complicated indeed. Experts say that the case would have to be fought in China, a country that does not exactly have a reputation for strictly enforced copyright law. </p> <p>Still, Breiner is unwavering in his position. \"My arrangements of public-domain anthems are original compositions from a legal point of view,\" he told the post. \"Which means if someone wants to record them, they have to purchase the material.\"</p> <p>Maybe he can arm wrestle them for it.</p>",
  "<p> You're not singing any more... or are you just really quiet? Rage against the Machine play Reading</p> <p>So that's Reading festival over for another year - our livers are battered, our new band appetite has been sated but our ears, well, they're not ringing at all. We watched some <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/aug/23/readingandleedsfestival.popandrock\">great, loud shows</a> in the smaller tents this year, but when it came to the headliners on the main stage, this year's bash was supernaturally quiet. </p> <p>The problem first announced itself (timidly) during <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/aug/23/rage.against.the.machine\">Rage Against the Machine's set</a>. Unless you made your way right to the front, the sound was barely audible. Conversations about how best to find your tent and whether or not you could stomach another foot-long frankfurter shouldn't really be drowning out Killing in the Name, should they? What's more, when you're stood next to a non-fan who spends the whole set saying things like \"When are they going to play the one that goes 'You Can't Make Me Tidy My Bedroom'\" it kind of ruins the effect. In fact, the loudest thing in Rage's set had to be their orange Guantanamo overalls.</p> <p>The problem continued into Saturday with both Bloc Party and the Killers suffering a similar fate, causing many fans to have what is commonly known as \"a bit of a moan\". Parallels were drawn with Glastonbury 2007's inaudible pyramid stage. It was enough to provoke a response from festival chief Melvin Benn, who insisted the puny volume levels <a href=\"http://www.nme.com/news/various-artists/39225\">were out of his control</a>.</p> <p>The weather, he said, had caused the offsite readings to be higher than normal. Benn also claimed that he refused to lower the volume for the Killers any further, despite requests from the council. But if all of this is down to chance, it makes you wonder if the Reading site is really that suitable for a music festival after all.</p> <p>The odd thing was that Metallica's performance on the Sunday night boomed and echoed across the entire site. Some brilliant rumours soon spread around the backstage area that Metallica (who each travelled down in a separate tourbus) had refused to play unless the volume was turned down for the other two headliners.</p> <p>Benn reckons he has a plan in place for next year's festival, which he will announce shortly. Maybe it's to book Metallica for all three nights.</p>",
  "<p>Here's my Denver diary from today's Guardian newspaper:</p> <p>\u2022 As the Democratic convention got under way, at least three tornadoes touched down in or near Denver, accompanied by thunder and spectacular lightning \u2014 proof, surely, that God hates liberals, although maybe he was simply expressing aesthetic objections to some of the extraordinarily tacky Obama merchandise for sale on every street corner. A tiny number of John McCain-branded goods were also available, in the interests of balance. At its main stage in downtown Denver, the news network MSNBC was distributing the most ill-conceived merchandise of the convention so far: nonpartisan t-shirts featuring both Obama and McCain. </p> <p>\u2022 All eyes will be on Obama's running-mate Joe Biden when he addresses the convention Wednesday night. Or at least they will for the first hour or three: the Delaware senator has a famous tendency to ramble. The Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen once gently criticised this loquaciousness in an article, prompting a phone message from Biden, who thanked him for making the point, which he acknowledged was a fair one, although then again, he said, he did have his reasons for speaking at such length, but yes, it was probably a legitimate criticism, and that \u2014 at which point Cohen's answering machine cut him off.</p> <p>\u2022 A big truck is making its way through the streets of Denver, all day, every day, urging people to \"Vote Libertarian!\". They won't, of course: almost everyone here's a Democrat, implacably opposed to the Libertarian argument that pretty much all taxation is supremely evil unless, possibly, it's being used to fund a strong military. Under a zero-taxation libertarian administration, of course, there'd presumably be no streets for such a truck to drive down. But we can cross that bridge when we come to it. Which we won't, owing to the lack of streets.</p> <p>\u2022 Tonight at the convention will be all about Barack Obama's family \u2014 his wife, his half-sister and his brother-in-law were all scheduled to appear \u2014 but someone was missing: George Hussein Onyango Obama, one of his half-brothers, who lives in Kenya. Republicans in Texas released an ad today that railed against the nominee for allowing his relative to live in squalor: \"If Barack cares so much about your family,\" it asks, \"why doesn't he take care of his family first?\" Awkwardly, though, George Obama isn't staying on message. \"Here [in Kenya],\" he told a reporter recently, \"I am surrounded by friends and family and feel safe and secure.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Eight years ago, when Barack Obama arrived at the Democratic convention in Los Angeles, the Hertz car rental desk at the airport declined his credit card. He didn't have enough influential friends to be able to obtain a coveted floor pass, the Washington Post reports, so he had to watch the speeches on a big TV screen outside. He flew home \"dejected\" a few days before the convention ended, never to be heard of again.</p>",
  "<p>I'll confess I wasn't thrilled by the aspiring first-lady's dress. The colour (an off-turquoise?) didn't favour Michelle Obama's lovely skin tone, and it clashed with the blue background onstage at Denver's Pepsi Centre. I was reminded of John McCain's speech the June night when Obama effectively clinched the nomination, given in front of what one Republican described to conservative pundit William Kristol as a \"dumb green puke background\". In addition, the large broach or ornament in the center of Obama's dress was an intrusive distraction from her delicate neckline.</p> <p> I expressed all this to my girlfriend last night while we were watching the proceedings on television, and she, an ardent feminist who is hypersensitive to hints of male sexism, whacked me on the arm. I reminded her that I have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/may/06/thinisin\">written</a> about Barack Obama's physical appearance. And whether or not it ends up in my news reporting, I always privately note McCain and Obama's attire -- for example whether they are wearing suits and ties or open collars, rolled-up sleeves, whatever.</p> <p>There is unquestionably a political element to a critic of Obama's wardrobe. My guess is the Obama camp, which needed to portray Michelle Obama last night as a regular, non-threatening, not-too-sexy American mom, wanted her in the softer-toned dress that doesn't strike of high-fashion. I would have preferred her in black.</p>",
  "<p>Anti-government protesters have stormed the compound of Thailand's prime minister, Samak Sundaravej, as part of demonstrations across Bangkok today aimed at forcing his resignation.</p> <p>The rightwing People's Alliance for Democracy is behind the protests and shut down the National Broadcasting Services of Thailand TV channel with a pre-dawn raid on the main studios of the government-operated station.</p> <p>\"We are now controlling most of the key government offices to prevent them from coming to work,\" said Sondhi Limthongkul, a leader of the alliance.</p> <p>\"Today we declare a long, long holiday for the government.\"</p> <p>The group's strategy appears to be to provoke a violent crackdown by the government, with the aim of winning public sympathy and perhaps compelling the army to step in to restore order. </p> <p>General Anupong Paochinda, the country's army chief, said the military would not stage a coup and the crisis could be solved politically.</p> <p>After the government was forced to move its weekly cabinet meeting to a military compound, Samak appeared on television to warn that his patience was running out. He said his interior minister had been given direct control of the police to \"bring the situation back to normal\".</p> <p>The People's Alliance for Democracy, which aligns itself with conservative factions of the monarchy and military, says Samak is a proxy for the former prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra.</p> <p>Thaksin, who was ousted in a 2006 military coup over alleged corruption and abuse of power, is in self-imposed exile in England.</p> <p>The alliance has accused Samak of trying to amend the constitution to help Thaksin avoid corruption charges. It accuses the government of failing to aggressively prosecute cases against Thaksin and refusing calls to extradite him to face court.</p> <p>The movement wants to replace the country's electoral democracy with a system that would be dominated by appointees from the bureaucracy and the military. It claims the country's rural majority is not sophisticated enough to choose good public servants.</p>",
  "<p>We moved around a lot as I was growing up but there was one constant fixture in every house we occupied. In some corner of the kitchen or dining room was the Magic Drawer. Here my mother used to accumulate stuff \u2026 kipple \u2026 detritus. I want to say she did it because she believed that one day it would be useful but that would be to call the woman who bore me delusional. </p> <p>A large part of the contents was used batteries - and though I often explained that these were not the rechargeable kind and could never have any useful function again, she'd just nod, as if filled with ancient wisdom and pour in another half a dozen triple As. Between the deceased Duracels lurked plastic bags containing the last pieces left over from self-assembly furniture. Again, I was swift to point out that these could have no function unless, one day, by staggering coincidence, someone else was missing the instructions, Allen key and No.9 locking washer from a wall-hung pot-rack called Krappi, but she carried on, always, infuriatingly, knowing better.</p> <p>I tell you this bit of deep psychological background because, while researching a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2008/aug/21/foodanddrink\">post last week</a> realised that I've entirely inherited my mother's pack-rat traits when it comes to the freezer. <br><br>Sure, I can explain away the plastic film-cans full of chopped herbs and the baggies of demi-glace as thrift; I can point to the carefully bagged and tagged leftovers with some protestant pride but the fact is that a lot of it is jammed with stuff I just can't bear to throw away. A bag of crab wreckage that I know will have to be secured as a biohazard long before I make a cioppino, 19 feet of scrubbed hog gut that will never case a salami; there's a piece of pecorino rind in there that's been waiting to go in a risotto since it came off ration.</p> <p>But though the contents may be odd, I still firmly believe that a freezer should be full. It's more fuel efficient, there's a certain warm, glowing feeling that in some way you are adequately insured against societal collapse and dammit, I might get round to making sausages this year.</p> <p>The Baker, though, is constantly enraged by the full freezer, snapping fingernails against rammed blocks of gelid offal, tutting at bergs of maturing mutton stock and swearing, loud and long at the permafrost. I admit, it must be frustrating trying to find space in my system when you suddenly need to chill down, for example, an eight layer wedding cake but that's not the point here. To the Baker, a well kept freezer is an empty one. While the Baker refuses to shop for more food until we've 'eaten up what we've got' - including the hog gut - I can't, somehow communicate is that the whole raison d'etre of a freezer is to store things in it.</p> <p>Is your freezer a solid slab of ice-age culinary archeology or sub-zero, Zen / rationalist void?</p>",
  "<p>Today's second one-day international at Trent Bridge represents a big moment in the life of Kevin Pietersen. So far the captaincy has been a cinch. He has won a Test match against a team still nursing Edgbaston hangovers and a one-dayer against a team that had spent the best part of a week drumming its fingers in hotel rooms. And he won two important tosses. Decent captains are lucky captains. But the early signs are that there is more to Pietersen's captaincy than good fortune.</p> <p>We'll come to the man-management side in a minute, but what about the tactics? Fears that Pietersen's ostentatious brand of touchy-feeliness reflected a desire to ingratiate rather than dominate were quashed on Friday night at Headingley. Jimmy Anderson, it transpired, was not injured: Pietersen felt he had struggled in his first three overs and did not invite him to return. And he was happy to go on the record and explain that Ravi Bopara's two-over spell had failed to take the pace off the ball as he had requested. Thus 15 or so potential overs were limited to a total of five. Now that's ruthless.</p> <p>Yet ruthlessness means nothing without adventure. Pietersen summed up the conditions and bowled Samit Patel for a full 10 overs, which was brave considering his age (23) and the piecemeal nature of his left-arm spin (31 wickets in 39 first-class matches). He also gave himself five overs, which evoked a refreshing lack of false modesty (Michael Vaughan was hampered by his knee, it's true, but he never gave his own off-breaks the credit they deserved). Between them, Patel and Pietersen removed Herschelle Gibbs, AB de Villiers and Mark Boucher, which suggests the tactics were good hunches at the very least.</p> <p>So what of the way in which his players have responded to him? When Pietersen was appointed, a dressing-room source suggested privately that his man-management skills needed - how to put it? - fine-tuning. Yet he has handled Steve Harmison superbly, first hurrying him back into the Test XI, then persuading him out of one-day retirement and damning the consequences (connections made with the Stanford game have been cynical at best). The trick now is to make Harmison feel loved (no problem there) while keeping him on his toes: Pietersen's decisiveness at Headingley suggests this won't be too much trouble either.</p> <p>With Andrew Flintoff it is a case of so far, so good. The pair have not always been bosom buddies, but Pietersen has handed Flintoff the No5 slot when recent form was hardly making an unanswerable case, and is bowling him in tandem with Harmison in the middle overs: a prospect so frightening for opposition batsmen it's a wonder England haven't spent the last few years building their entire one-day strategy around it. If Pietersen can prevent the good-natured but occasionally enervating nature of the Flintoff-Harmison axis from taking hold in his dressing room, he will have won half the battle.</p> <p>Yes, that's <em>his</em> dressing room. Because one of the major beneficiaries of the Pietersen honeymoon has been the coach Peter Moores, who can now take his rightful place in the background while the likes of KP, Fred and Harmy keep us entertained on and off the pitch. Who knows, if Vaughan had been scoring runs, Moores may have found himself under more pressure than he already is, but Pietersen appears to be doing the job on his terms (see the recall of Harmison) and so far it's working.</p> <p>But this isn't all about the celebrity names. Pietersen has spotted something of a kindred spirit in the wrists and originality of Owais Shah, who will get a run at No3 and has the chance - finally - to shed the baggage accumulated under Duncan Fletcher. His promotion is what is normally called a vote of confidence, and it is up to Shah to repay it. Ian Bell must open or not play at all, despite his infuriating, boundary-less 35 in 69 balls on Friday, and Matt Prior is worth a try as his hard-hitting accomplice.</p> <p>The one area in which Pietersen must be careful is his treatment of the two young batting all-rounders Bopara and Luke Wright. He was probably correct to limit Bopara to two overs in Leeds, but Wright did not bowl at all (Pietersen explained that his skiddy style would not have suited the conditions) and needs a performance to shake off the suspicion that he is not even a fully-fledged member of the bits-and-pieces brigade. For all Pietersen's group hugs, there is a hard edge to his leadership. If he suspects Wright's selection has anything at all to do with the fact that he, like Moores, is a Sussex man, he will not last long.</p> <p>Today, like we said, is a big day. Victory in Nottingham and the whispers about beginner's luck will fade.</p> <p><em>Extract taken from <a href=\"http://sport.theguardian.com/thespin/0,,806133,00.html\">The Spin</a>, theguardian.com's weekly take on the world of cricket.

  "<p>In the Queen's speech this autumn Gordon Brown's government will announce a scheme to institute a database of every telephone call, email, and act of online usage by every resident of the UK. It will propose that this information will be gathered, stored, and \"made accessible\" to the security and law enforcement agencies, local councils, and \"other public bodies\".</p> <p>This fact should be in equal parts incredible and nauseating. It is certainly enraging and despicable. Not even George Orwell in his most febrile moments could have envisaged a world in which every citizen could be so thoroughly monitored every moment of the day, spied upon, eavesdropped, watched, tracked, followed by CCTV cameras, recorded and scrutinised. Our words and web searches, our messages and intimacies, are to be stored and made available to the police, the spooks, the local council \u2013 the local council! \u2013 and \"other public bodies\".</p> <p>This Orwellian nightmare, additionally, is proposed for a world in which leading soi-disant liberal democracies run, and/or permit rendition flights to, Guantanamo Bay. How many steps separate an innocent British citizen from some misinterpretation or interference or error in the collected and 'made accessible' data of text messages and emails, and a forthcoming home-grown version of Guantanamo Bay for people whose pattern of phone calls does not fit the police definition of acceptable?</p> <p>Two things have made this ghastly development possible: the technology, and politicians. The technology is way ahead of the game: <a href=\"http://w1.siemens.com/entry/cc/en/\">Siemens of Germany</a> are already supplying 60 countries with a device that monitors and integrates data from phone, email and internet activity; its software establishes patterns of uses and alerts monitoring staff to deviations from the patterns. As <a href=\"http://technology.newscientist.com/article/dn14591-surveillance-made-easy.html\">New Scientist reports</a>, the system is already known to throw up huge numbers of false positives; that could have been predicted by a rudimentary acquaintance with human nature and human life. But it is a fact that has to be added to the brilliance and reliability of government and law enforcement agencies in keeping data secure, unhackable and unlosable. </p> <p>The second point concerns the quality of our politicians. They say they are putting us all under suspicion for our own good. They wish to protect us against terrorists and criminals, and to make bureaucracy more efficient. The efficiency of bureaucracy has one of its finest moments in the neat and sorted piles of false teeth, hair and spectacles at the gas chamber doors. Oh no: better the milling crowd than the police-disciplined queues of bureaucratic efficiency; better the irritation of dealing with human fallibility than the fear of dealing with jack-booted gendarmes whose grip on one's arms follows stepping out of the queue.</p> <p>But as to the first matter: protecting us \u2013 by making us all suspects, all potential criminals and terrorists \u2013 from terrorism and criminality. Well: the first duty of our politicians should be to protect our liberties, and to encourage us to see that liberty carries risks, which we should be trusted to understand and accept so that we can make our own lives our own way. But no: these politicians \u2013 Brown and Labour, once the party of the people \u2013 are going to keep us safe by not keeping our liberties safe; they are going to keep us safe by making us unfree. Yet the putative benefit of protecting us from terrorism and crime is unattainable. They themselves say 'there is no 100% guarantee of safety': but they are going to spy on us all anyway! In fact they are going to create crime: a huge new criminal industry awaits for stealing, copying, falsely creating and manipulating that newly-created precious commodity, \"identity\". A huge new impetus awaits for techno-crime to disrupt the monitoring and data storage systems on which the government intends to spend billions of our tax money, creating its unblinking eye in our bedrooms. As surely as night follows day, the new surveillance society will do more harm than good.</p> <p>The potential for profoundly negative uses of technology has escaped us. It is with despair that I conclude that we have to start all over again with the demos and resistance, the campaigns and arguments, to roll back this huge and ultimately destructive assault on our civil liberties. Once upon a time the authorities worked at frightening everyone into thinking that the unblinking eye of a deity exercised surveillance and data-gathering over them. Now we have Gordon Brown and Siemens, the real thing, not a myth: the unblinking eye of the security services, the local council, \"other public bodies\", in our bedrooms, our text messages, our emails, our internet searches. Torquemada and Stalin would have given their right arms for what Gordon Brown will tell us in this autumn's Queen's speech he is intending to introduce. Brown has not even thought of that comparison, shame and double shame upon him. Might it help to read the glutinous websites of the <a href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/security/surveillance/\">Home Office on surveillance and protection of our liberties</a>? Enjoy, if you can: or weep.</p> <p>Is this adequate to today, before the new universal surveillance comes on stream? Is it adequate to future developments in surveillance technology, to future even less benign governments, to increased \"security\" powers in actual or alleged future states of emergency? What new crimes, new criminals, new threats to society, will need to be plucked from the watched masses? Smokers? Readers of unauthorised books? Will old crimes return - homosexuality, Catholicism, Jewishness, atheism, adultery, pre-marital sex? Will every individual have to be a tight-lipped, right-thinking, timid, dutiful, obedient, queue-forming clone to escape the censure of the unblinking eye now being opened by the state upon us?</p> <p>We need to stop this assault on civil liberies going further, we need to roll back the attritions they have already suffered, and we need a rock solid written consitution to protect us from those who aim to make us all suspects in the gaze of the unblinking universal eye.</p>",
  "<p>Israel has nearly doubled the number of homes under construction in Jewish settlements in the West Bank this year, according to a report published today.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.peacenow.org.il/site/en/peace.asp?pi=61&amp;docid=3380\">The report, by Peace Now</a>, an Israeli organisation, said the housing ministry had begun work on 433 new settlement housing units between January and May this year compared with 240 in the same period last year, despite continuing negotiations with the Palestinians for a peace agreement. </p> <p>The organisation said its findings were based on figures from Israel's central bureau of statistics.</p> <p>It said more than 1,000 new buildings, representing 2,600 housing units, were under construction in settlements. Of these, 55% are on the eastern side of the concrete and steel barrier Israel has built in and along the West Bank.</p> <p>The US secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, who arrived in Israel yesterday for another round of talks with Israeli and Palestinian leaders, again criticised the settlement activity. </p> <p>Under the US road map plan - the framework for the current peace talks - Israel is to freeze all construction in the settlements. All settlements on occupied land are illegal under international law.</p> <p>\"I think it's no secret, and I have said it to my Israeli counterparts, that I don't think that settlement activity is helpful,\" Rice said. \"In fact, what we need now are steps that enhance confidence between the parties, and anything that undermines confidence between the parties ought to be avoided.\"</p> <p>Israeli and Palestinian leaders have so far failed to reach any agreement despite regular talks that began with the relaunch of the peace process in Annapolis, in the US, last November.</p> <p>Tzipi Livni, the Israeli foreign minister, said the process would \"not be affected\" by settlement activity. \"The role of the leaders is to try to find a way to live in peace in the future and not to let any kind of noises that relate to the situation on the ground these days to enter the negotiation room,\" she said.</p> <p>\"But at the end of the day the Israeli government's policy is not to expand settlements, not to build new settlements and not to confiscate Palestinian land.\"</p> <p>Livni said settlement activity had \"reduced in the most dramatic way\", particularly east of the barrier. But the figures from Peace Now appeard to challenge that argument.</p> <p>The organisation said the number of tenders issued for construction in the settlements had increased dramatically, standing at 417 housing units this year compared with 65 last year. </p> <p>The number of tenders in East Jerusalem was up to 1,761 housing units from 46 last year.</p> <p>The group said there appeared to be a trend to use construction to form a \"territorial connection\" between the more distant West Bank settlements and the larger settlement blocks. \"Despite the Israeli government's renewed commitment during the Annapolis summit to freeze all settlement activity, the construction has continued and almost doubled in all of the settlements and outposts on both sides of the separation barrier,\" the report said. </p> <p>\"This construction undermines the Palestinian partners, creating facts on the ground that might prevent the possibility of a peace agreement.\"</p>",
  "<p> Unlike the film industry, where the superstar system ensures that personalities abound, there aren't many legends in computer games development. One person who does stand out, however, is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_McGee\">former id designer</a> <a href=\"http://www.americanmcgee.com/\">American McGee</a>, whose unusual name and raft of quirky, Tim Burton-esque titles ensure that people keep watch on what he's doing.</p> <p>Currently living in Shanghai and trickling out <a href=\"http://www.gametap.com/grimm/\">Grimm</a>, his latest anarchic opus based loosely on the fairy tales of the Brothers of the same name, the gamesblog tracked him down to find out where the other auteurs are, what it takes to be a free spirit in an industry obsessed with the bottom line, and what he's learned living in China.</p> <p><strong>Explain <a href=\"http://www.gametap.com/grimm/\">Grimm</a> to my mum.</strong> Grimm is a video game presented like a television show. The \"host\" is a crabby dwarf named Grimm who's had enough of fairy tales made too sweet by modern day political correctness. He longs for a time when fairy tales meant something, when they had teeth, contained lessons, and could frighten good behavior out of bad children. Each week he re-introduces a well-known tale in its current-day, toothless form. He then invites the player to help him return it to a grimmer state.</p> <p>The game play of Grimm is designed to be highly accessible - you \"paint\" darkness on the world by running around. Everything in the world can transform, the rocks and trees to the birds and bees convert from wholesome to horrific. When the work's done Grimm once again presents the tale. But this time things are more to his liking: Justice is served, naivety and bad deeds are punished, and all's well that ends up dead.</p> <p>In total there are 24 episodes of Grimm, delivered in a unique weekly fashion. You can get the episodes for FREE during the first 24 hours after their weekly launch, just like television. After that you can still play the game using a variety of pay methods, either via GameTap's site or other digital distribution partners.</p> <p><strong>Your games have a distinctive style and a dark humour that's unusual in games. Where do you get your inspiration?</strong> My childhood was bizarre and often scary. I was fed an odd mix of media, real life drama, and travel. I suppose the heavy rotation of Jacques Cousteau and Monte Python took its toll. These days I take inspiration mostly from the artist and creators that surround me at work. We've assembled an eclectic bunch here in Shanghai. People from around the world, with a variety of odd background, all intent on expressing themselves through games. Nothing better than collaborating with a group of interesting and odd people to get truly inspired.</p> <p><strong>Which distribution model encourages the most creativity? Why?</strong> A finance and distribution model that allows an audience time to find a product is best. The current retail box-product model suffers not because of the distribution - but because of the limited availability of shelf space at the retail outlets. Scarcity of shelf space means a game must perform exceptionally well - beating out all other competitors for shelf space - the moment it hits the shelves or be considered a failure. This creates a self-fulfilling prophecy, relegating good games to obscurity, and limiting customer choice.</p> <p>A publisher who funds and distributes with digital distribution in mind, creates an environment where creativity can be encouraged. Designers aren't forced to fit into pre-defined genre slots or to focus on \"me-too\" designs that kowtow to market expectations. Bigger risks can be taken on smaller projects. And successful small projects can be expanded on when appropriate.</p> <p>In general the industry needs more forms of incubators.</p> <p><strong>Where do you see the most creativity in gaming coming from? Are there any people/studios you keep an eye on?</strong> It seems that a lot of the most successful creativity is being expressed in smaller format games and (as is the case with the Wii) on innovative platforms. Studios that embrace alternates, be it in distribution, development methods, interface devices, or explore other untested concepts in gaming, tend to produce the most interesting content. I'm particularly interested in things coming out of Nintendo, Media Molecule, Telltale, GameTap, Valve, and EA Partners. Each of these groups is helping to reshape various aspects of game development, distribution, interface, and financing.</p> <p><strong>You've developed a reputation as a creative and Tim Burton-esque developer: an independent spirit with big budget funding. Why is this so unusual in the industry?</strong> Independent spirit maybe, big budget funding barely. But the budgets (as long as they aren't painfully limiting) aren't the point. I think my reputation (good and bad) has come from the fact I've been consistently unusual in my approach to development (location, methodology), storytelling (themes, characters), and the presence of my name in association with the game titles. People know to expect the unexpected. Compared with other (perhaps wiser?) developers and studios who strive for consistent, if somewhat repetitive, development and market performance, I'm more interested in testing new ideas.</p> <p><strong>Looking back at your career, where do you think you learned the most, in terms of the skills you have today?</strong> A lot of the foundation came from id - the understanding of the dedication and creativity needed to produce good games. The business understanding came in part from the time I spent with EA, and also in large part from the time I've spent as an independent developer. But the hardest and best lessons certainly came with the development of my last game, Bad Day LA. Everything that could go wrong did go wrong, and I walked away with a mountain of lessons. Until the point that development skidded off the track and crashed I held in my mind that any problem, no matter how big, could be solved - any broken project fixed. Perhaps true when there's unlimited time and resources - but the reality of the world outside places like id and EA is that things can just break beyond fixing. The realization of that fact has increased my respect for good planning and management as well as my admiration for solid game development teams in general.</p> <p>I'm still learning a huge amount every day - thanks to being in Shanghai, starting a new studio, and working on some innovative projects like Grimm. Being here is a challenge on every level - culturally, linguistically, and physically. Nothing can be taken for granted, everything must be proven and re-proven - from handling of company finances and planning, to development processes, team building, and interface with the local community. Thankfully, all these challenges are interesting and very rewarding.</p> <p><strong>You currently live in Shanghai. How have you been influenced by that culture in your game designs and development styles?</strong> It's had a tremendous impact on my development style. Living in China has made me more respectful of the limited nature of things: time, resources, and energy. It has impressed upon me the importance of process, clear communication, and strong team culture. And it has really opened my eyes to the chemistry of people - human nature, personality types, and shared expectations. All of this has driven me to take a very personal and humanistic approach to how the studio has grown and our projects are planned.</p> <p>As the development environment in China is still new and has a lot of growing to do, I think one of the most important things our studio can do to influence the future is to illustrate a more human approach to development. With that in mind we plan and prioritize to avoid overtime and \"crunch\" work. We emphasize health and rest as keys to higher productivity and creativity. And we encourage openness and communication between people and departments as a way of working more effectively.</p> <p>Our games are of course impacted by exposure to the environment here. Now that we're starting work on a game specifically designed for the China market I see myself leveraging the past 4 years of language, culture, and understanding into the game concept, design, and creative direction. It's an odd thing to be a foreigner building games for the Chinese market - but so far, so good. We're having a lot of fun, learning a lot, and I hope bringing to life something rewarding for our team and our audience.</p> <p><strong>What will be the next revolution in gaming?</strong> I think we'll continue to see updated interface devices at the forefront of the mini-revolutions in the years to come. Ultimately, I think this is all heading to one uber-revolution in the shape of seamless computer-human interfaces, ala \"The Matrix\". It'll be great to get away from the dated keyboard/mouse, monitor, speakers way of interfacing with our content. As soon as someone starts offering trial \"implant\" testing - I'll be first in line. I just hope I don't crash my brain, it would take a lifetime to reinstall everything.</p> <p><em>You can get the first episode of Grimm for free from <a href=\"http://www.GameTap.com\">GameTap</a>.

  "<p>I first saw Chandra* last week lying on a bench outside the church, squinting into the morning sun. He didn't look accustomed to sleeping rough. His towel and clothes were folded neatly inside his carrier bag home and he'd kept himself clean. He smiled easily, laughed readily. With limited English, he told me he was \"OK\". This, it would transpire, was his primary line of defence.</p> <p>Chandra, it seems, had been evicted a fortnight ago by a private landlord from a northern city. He was Sri Lankan, an asylum seeker who had been granted leave to remain here, and had been working as a cleaner doing 60-hour weeks at one point. He'd lost his home, he said, and needed another. He couldn't remember why. Together we walked down the road to the council's homeless person's unit \u2013 now named \"Housing Aid\" because officially there is no problem with homeless people in this inner London borough. </p> <p>In a shop on the way, I ask Chandra what fruit he might want. He fingers the satsumas like an expert before settling on a firm, dome-shaped one. Later, he would explain, he had his own fruit and vegetable stall in Sri Lanka. The council receptionists have the obligatory weary expression that comes from working the front line. \"Take a ticket,\" one mutters before the woman tells Chandra that he has to go back to his northern council. He has no local connection to this London borough. I, they sigh, will not do.</p> <p>We do not know what exactly has brought Chandra here. But when people run away, I try to explain, they're unlikely to rush back. And anyway, he's not well. There's a standoff as I'm told repeatedly that this is \"the legislation\". It's at this point, I think, that new rough sleepers can slip through the net \u2013 refused and palmed off with a list of hostels. How can a sleep-deprived, confused rough sleeper with no phone, money or language calmly call a list of hostels that will only be full, anyway?</p> <p>An advice worker eventually sees us after I \u2013 to my horror \u2013 start to cry. She calls a local supported housing charity who will only see Chandra if he's referred by another agency. The worker calls a local advocacy charity \u2013 who turn out to be brilliant \u2013 to come down immediately. They will try to refer him. But Chandra is getting impatient. On being asked questions, he grasps the sides of his skull. \"Head hurts,\" he says. \"Too many questions.\" </p> <p>No one seems to see he might have mental health issues \u2013 or as we suspect later \u2013 undiagnosed post-traumatic stress disorder. He doesn't present as drunk or drugged and his smiles and lack of English make him easy to dismiss.</p> <p>\"Let's go,\" Chandra says to me. \"No more waiting.\" He's off down the road, back to the church where I found him, stopping sporadically to check I'm following. A whole day of events finally gets him to the advocacy charity. But this is only the beginning, the helpful chief executive tells me, while doing the assessment. The bureaucracy is illogical. Chandra doesn't know that he would have had shelter this weekend if the receptionist at the supported hostel not refused to hand over the faxed referral form because it was five minutes late.</p> <p>In the office, towards the end of the day, Chandra allowed himself a moment of hope. It flickered into his eyes as the worker filled out a form for him. It didn't last more than a second. Today, Chandra is still on the streets, at risk from others, waiting \u2013 not demanding \u2013 for a space to open up.</p> <p>* Not his real name</p>",

He made it clear tonight that, while frail, he was not going to be satisfied with a mere video tribute to a political career now in its 48th year.</p> <p>The crush of the convention floor, the giddiness of activists waving placards, the speeches - Kennedy has loved it all.</p> <p>\"My fellow Democrats, my fellow Americans, it is so wonderful to be here tonight,\" Kennedy said. \"Nothing, nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight.\"</p> <p>The crowd believed it, but there was awareness too that this may well be Kennedy's last Democratic convention.</p> <p>Kennedy however betrayed no such doubts, and he did not falter when urging the crowd to support Obama's candidacy. \"I have come here tonight to stand with you to change America. To restore its future, to rise to its best ideals, and to elect Barack Obama president of the United States,\" Kennedy said.</p> <p>\"For me this is a season of hope,\" he said. \"This is the cause of my life - new hope.\"</p> <p>Kennedy's decision in January to support Obama's run for the White House was a turning point in his campaign. With the Kennedy seal of approval, Obama was adopted as the heir to America's reigning political dynasty.</p> <p>In his remarks tonight, Kennedy made a reference to that family legacy.</p> <p>\"This November the torch will be passed again to a new generation of Americans,\" he said. Then he went on pledge to be in the Senate next January when Obama is sworn in as president.</p> <p>He was beaming when he entered the stage, steadied by his wife Victoria Reggie Kennedy. And though there was a shaved portion on the left side of his head, a relic of treatment, and Kennedy's jacket hung a little loosely on his large frame, for members of the Massachusetts delegation, just the sight of their senior senator appeared to offer a measure of reassurance.</p> <p>As Kennedy made his speech for Obama, the crowd erupted several times: Ted-dy, Ted-dy.</p> <p>\"We are all so emotional,\" said Ana Maria Camarago, who appeared at times on the verge of tears. \"There isn't going to be a dry eye here. We are all so used to him being strong.\"</p> <p>Like others in the hall, she wore a button with Kennedy's likeness emblazoned with the legendary slogan from his 1980 run for the White House. Kennedy's challenge to Jimmy Carter, who was then president, left the Democratic party ruinously divided. But the slogan has become a mantra for many Democrats of that generation: \"The cause endures, the hope still lives and the dream shall never die.\"</p> <p>Though evidently affected by his illness, Kennedy's voice was relatively strong and his voice clear. As he spoke, the atmosphere among the Massachusetts delegates lifted.</p> <p>\"He inspired so many of us to go into public service,\" said Lida Harkins. Now the majority whip in the Massachusetts house of representatives, she was a volunteer on Kennedy's first campaign for the Senate. \"All of us look up to him.\"</p> <p>In the tribute, Caroline Kennedy credited her uncle for progressive legislation on civil rights, healthcare and the minimum wage - all the fruits of a career in the Senate that has spanned five decades.</p> <p>The sheer sweep of that history, made human flesh in Kennedy's appearance, reduced the crowd that only moments before had been dancing in their seats to silence.</p> <p>There were sighs at the heartbreaking photo of Kennedy with his two older brothers, John and Robert, who would later be assassinated.</p> <p>When the video turned to footage of an impassioned young Ted Kennedy banging his desk in the Senate, the crowd cheered.</p> <p>And when the video showed footage, decades later, an impassioned snowy-haired Ted Kennedy asserting access to healthcare as a fundamental right, the crowd roared again.</p> <p>There were echoes of those famous lines as Kennedy left the stage in Denver: \"The work begins anew. The hope rises again, and the dream lives on.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>DENVER</strong> \u2014 Good evening from the Pepsi Center, here in downtown Denver, and doesn't it slightly undermine the historic nature of this week's events that they're happening in a building called the Pepsi Center? Then again, as others have noted, perhaps it's appropriate: Obama is <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/id/2198198/\">the Pepsi to Hillary Clinton's establishment Coke</a>. (Besides, Coca-Cola is the official sponsor of recycling at the convention, underlining the message of unity: Clinton and Obama supporters, Pepsi and Coca-Cola drinkers, united in their heartwarming commitment to change and tooth decay.) Any minute now, we're expecting a star-spangled tribute to Edward Kennedy, quite possibly featuring Edward Kennedy, who \u2014 if his doctors let him appear \u2014 will cause every delegate in the hall to erupt in a spontaneous upwelling of emotion, because that is Edward Kennedy's designated role in American politics. The rest of the evening is devoted to Barack Obama's \"American story,\" with contributions from his brother-in-law and the headline speaker, his wife Michelle. (We already heard from his half-sister.) The future-first-lady speech is a crucial one: in effect, she must introduce her husband \u2014 as a person \u2014 to the country. I'll be liveblogging it all here, in an entirely disorganised, rambling, stream-of-consciousness fashion.<br><br>7.20pm: It's hard to describe in words the atmosphere on the convention floor here, but I'll try. For a start, of course, the space is huge, and packed \u2014 it can hold almost 20,000 people \u2013 but that's true of many political rallies. What's different here is that the whole thing feels like an enormous movie set, and everybody inside behaves like an actor: they know the entire country's watching. If you're even slightly a fan of the West Wing you basically can't survive more than a few seconds inside without expiring. I'm back now in the press tent, which does not induce this effect.</p> <p>7.25pm: It's time for a video tribute to Edward Kennedy! The video includes footage of Edward Kennedy on a sailboat, and Edward Kennedy in a rural setting. It's all a bit biased in favour of Edward Kennedy, if you ask me.</p> <p>7.30pm: And here he is, the Lion of the Senate! The crowd's too ecstatic to let him speak. As part of their spontaneous upwelling of emotion, they have hundreds of identical pre-printed banners reading \"Kennedy\". \"My fellow Democrats, my fellow Americans, it is so wonderful to be here... I have come here tonight to stand with you. To change America... and to elect Barack Obama president of the United States.\" He's looking remarkably chipper.</p> <p>\"Barack Obama will be a commander-in-chief who understands that young Americans in uniform must never be committed to a mistake.\"</p> <p>\"When John Kennedy thought of going to the moon, he didn't say it's too far to get there, we shouldn't even try... The work begins anew. The hope rises again. And the dream lives on.\" You might have heard that somewhere before.</p> <p>8.02pm: Back in the convention hall now, and I'm jammed into a concrete corner just behind the Iowa and Vermont delegations, which means that soon I'll get to watch Michelle Obama's back. </p> <p>8.07pm: But first longtime the former Republican congressman Jim Leach is extolling the benefits of bipartisanship. It must be noted that he is doing this in a rather boring fashion. Leach gets a cheer when he namechecks JFK, but that's not really a testament to his rhetorical skills. If I said \"JFK\" right now, I'm pretty sure people would cheer.</p> <p>8.10pm: Hey \u2014 they did, too! But only a few of them, because I only said it quietly.</p> <p>8.20pm: By the way, CNN's coverage of this event is strange. On the left-hand side of the screen, there's a meter labelled \"Sound from the Floor\", which goes up and down according to the level of applause and other noise. Why?</p> <p>8.23pm: Time for a video tribute to Michelle Obama. In it, Michelle Obama recalls first hearing Barack's name. \"Who names their kid Barack Obama? This guy has to be weird.\"</p> <p>8.30pm: Here's Craig Robinson, Michelle Obama's brother. He thinks she's great, basically. \"Sometimes, when I look at the woman you're about to hear from, it's funny to think this is he same person who used to wake me up early -- and I mean early -- on Christmas morning... the person who even though we were allowed only one hour of television a night, somehow managed to memorise every single episode of the Brady Bunch.\" Got that, America? She's an EVERYDAY AMERICAN. (Apart from the part about the freaky memorising skills.) </p> <p>8.35pm: And here's Michelle. I think it would be fair to say she's being made to feel welcome. I can confirm that she has the back of a potential future First Lady. She's very quiet \u2014 almost hard to hear. (I wonder if that's calculated, or am I just a cynic?) </p> <p>8.40pm: Now Michelle is giving an elitist account of her Ivy League sociology dissertation. Not really! She's telling us she loves her family, very much. No, seriously, VERY much. And: \"I stand here today at the crosscurrents of history, knowing that my piece of the American dream is a blessing hard won by those who came before me.\"</p> <p>8.46pm: A rather ostentatious moment of praise for Hillary Clinton. And now we're into the part of the speech designed to smother any questions over Michelle's <a href=\"http://news.bostonherald.com/news/national/politics/2008/view.bg?articleid=1074519&amp;srvc=home&amp;position=0\">pride in being American</a>. (Did I mention that Barack Obama's story is an American story? Every speaker tonight has done so, several times.)</p> <p>\"...The current of history meets this new tide of hope. That is why I love this country. And in my own life, in my own small way, I've tried to give back to this country that has given me so much. That's why I left a job at a law firm for a career in public service, working to empower young people to volunteer in their communities. Because I believe that each of us, no matter what our age or background or walk of life, has something to contribute to the life of this nation.\"</p> <p>\"You see, Barack doesn't care where you're from, or what your background is... see, that's just not how he sees the world. He knows that the thread that connects us, our belief in America's promise, [is] strong enough to hold us togeether as one nation, it was strong enough to bring hope to those neighbourhoods in Chicago... After all that's happened... the Barack Obama I know today is the same man I fell in love with.\" </p> <p>8.57pm: Oh, and look, if it isn't the Obama children, and now Mr Barack Obama himself, live on video-link. The kids are having a sickeningly cutesy conversation with the enormous Barack Obama on the screen, which the delegates will probably love.</p> <p>9.21pm: And so here is what we can conclude about Michelle Obama from tonight's speech. She loves America, she is quiet and not scary or opinionated, and she loves America. Also, she loves America. A cautious and gaffe-free speech that might go a long way towards defusing the uneasiness some apparently feel about her. But also a humour-free one, which is a pity, because she does humour very well indeed.</p> <p>It's Hillary Clinton's turn tomorrow. Can she love America more than Michelle Obama does?
