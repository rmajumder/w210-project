  "<p>People could be given the power to object to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/drugsandalcohol\">alcohol</a> licensing applications on public health grounds under a radical plan from a commission charged with improving health in the most sickly city in the UK.</p> <p>The Health is Wealth commission proposes the introduction of community licensing forums as part of a 12-point plan to end Liverpool's reign at the top of the country's ill-health league.</p> <p>Such forums have already been established in Scotland since changes to the law there in 2005 allowed licensing boards to consider the impact on public health of any new off licences, pubs or clubs.</p> <p>Licensing laws in England and Wales do not allow for specific public health considerations. But the commission believes the <a href=\"http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyandGuidance/DH_075218\">government's commitment to tackle alcohol-related crime and disorder</a> means there is scope to act.</p> <p>The idea comes in a report published today by the commission aimed at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/apr/30/england.deprivation\">improving the quality of life</a> for the 1 million people in the Liverpool city region, where life expectancy is three years less than the English average and seven years less than parts of the south-east.</p> <p>The commission \u2013 made up of 15 experts in fields including health, housing and policing - was established by the University of Liverpool as one of its contributions to the city's year as European Capital of Culture.</p> <p>Sue Woodward, who chaired the commission, said members had heard \"harrowing, often controversial, and always no-holds-barred evidence\" about the city's health and social problems.</p> <p>\"We have had to face up to some harsh truths: generations of families dependent on benefits; spiralling problems with obesity and alcohol misuse, and above all the creation of a super underclass; an invisible army of people disconnected and cut off from the opportunities being created on their own doorsteps,\" she said.</p> <p>The University of Liverpool and the area's local authorities and health trusts have pledged to implement the commission's blueprint for improving the city's health and wealth.</p> <p>As well as the alcohol forums, the group recommends the setting up of a world-class Institute of Deprivation, based at Liverpool University, to study inequality and deprivation in inner cities. Funding for this has already been secured.</p> <p>The commission recommends the institute offers a health MOT to every man, woman and child in the city.</p> <p>It also suggests the creation of a parks taskforce to make better use of the city's public spaces. It was inspired by Central Park in New York, where people are allowed to run small businesses to ensure areas are not left empty for long periods and help generate funding.</p> <p>And the commission proposes rewarding firms which promote work-based health and wellbeing; setting up a taskforce to examine the causes of and contributors to the high level of incapacity benefit claimants in the city (75% higher than the British average); and ensuring health and wellbeing are at the heart of the design process for new homes, schools, offices and public buildings.</p> <p>They also want local authorities to support social enterprises which recruit people who have been claiming incapacity benefit.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Director: Michael Bay<br>Entertainment grade: D<br>History grade: C</strong></p> <p>On 7 December 1941, the Japanese navy devastated the American Pacific fleet in a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. The raid killed 2,403 people, and dragged the United States into World War II. </p> <p>Michael Bay's film attempted to turn the attack on Pearl Harbor into a love story, adding for good measure the Battle of Britain beforehand, the Doolittle Raid on Tokyo afterwards, and a lot of explosions.</p> <h2>Politics</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337723486\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/09/17/ph1f0140s.jpg\" alt=\"Pearl Harbor\" width=\"140\" height=\"176\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Ben Affleck stars as the fictional Rafe McCawley, a plucky USAF pilot who sees action in all three of the film's battles. That's impossible, for a start: the Eagle Squadrons in the Battle of Britain only accepted civilian Americans. Cue some scenes in Britain, a cold place full of beer, stately homes, and obsequious officers who spend all their time telling Americans how wonderful they are at fighting wars. Is this supposed to be making some sort of point? </p> <h2>Dialogue</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337723487\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/09/17/ph4f220.jpg\" alt=\"Pearl Harbor\" width=\"140\" height=\"171\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Rafe is having some injections in his bottom, courtesy of pretty nurse Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale). For some reason he decides this would be an ideal moment to ask her out. He tries to tell her that he likes her, but it comes out as \"Miss, I really, really lick you.\" Ha ha! A Freudian slip! Evelyn giggles as if it's sexy. Not a realistic reaction. In the 1940s, to \"lick\" someone meant to beat them up. </p> <h2>Romance</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337723488\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/09/17/pfh12220.jpg\" alt=\"Pearl Harbor\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Undeterred, Rafe turns up to meet Evelyn later. \"I got some genuine French champagne,\" he boasts. \"From France.\" This scene is set in December 1940. We can only hope Rafe bought the bottle at least seven months earlier, because northern France has been completely occupied by the Germans since June. Offering to punch a lady and then plying her with Nazi booze: if this character were really in the 1940s, he would need to work on his seduction technique.</p> <h2>People</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337723489\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/09/17/ph2f220.jpg\" alt=\"Pearl Harbor\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Cuba Gooding Jr appears for a cameo as Doris Miller, one of the real heroes of Pearl Harbor. Miller, a ship's cook, carried sailors to safety during the attack, then grabbed an anti-aircraft gun and took on the Japanese planes. In the film, he only interacts with the main characters in one scene, when Evelyn tends to his injuries. (She does this without a chaperone, even though she is white and he is African-American. Bearing in mind that the armed forces were actually increasing segregation in their hospitals at the time, this is hard to credit.) The real Miller was a stand-out figure at Pearl Harbor. It's a shame the film relegates him to a token role. </p> <h2>Warfare</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337723490\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/09/17/ph71f40.jpg\" alt=\"Pearl Harbor\" width=\"140\" height=\"200\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Too many faults to list here, but military history enthusiasts will find plenty to get their regimental knee breeches in a twist about. If you notice things like wrong-model Warhawks, prepare for three hours of teeth-grinding rage. The Doolittle Raid opens another can of mistake worms, not least the implication that the Americans bombed Tokyo to resolve a love triangle between Rafe, Evelyn and Rafe's best buddy. But by this point you might be too busy laughing at Alec Baldwin shouting \"Max power!\" to care.</p> <h2>Details</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337723491\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/09/17/phf11220.jpg\" alt=\"Pearl Harbor\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>In the 1940s, everyone smoked relentlessly. The 2001 film has a strict no smoking onscreen policy. Apparently, this is because smoking is bad for you. Which is true, but then again the movie shows people playing games of chicken in planes over populated areas, driving across open fields through machine gun fire in cars fully tanked up with petrol, and launching a full-scale military attack on American soil. All of which are even more bad for you than smoking. Ask your doctor.</p> <h2>Verdict</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337723492\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/09/17/ph32f20.jpg\" alt=\"Pearl Harbor\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>A motley collection of historical details, each of them a bit wrong. Many of the mistakes are minor, but if you add together the embellished battle sequences, the flimsy caricatures of real historical figures, the tin ear for period dialogue, and the weird fantasy version of 1940s America where no one smokes or is racist, you end up with a very peculiar war.</p>",
  "<p>A quarter of all the leading opera houses in Italy are under special administration - corresponding to bankruptcy - with debts approaching \u20ac50m (\u00a340m).</p> <p>The Arena at Verona, renowned for its open-air performances in the city's Roman amphitheatre, became the latest casualty this week and the culture minister, Sandro Bondi, will meet the administrators of the leading opera houses today to try to find a way out of the financial crisis.</p> <p>The financial failures are the product of a mix as heady and complex as any opera plot: poor management, vicious infighting, political interference, miserly sponsorship and, not least, deep cuts in government funding made by the last Silvio Berlusconi government, which was in office until 2006.</p> <p>A tactfully worded statement from the culture ministry said Bondi had appointed a senior official, Salvatore Nastasi, to take over the foundation that runs the Arena because of its \"delicate financial situation\". The rescue was triggered when the opera house reported a big loss for the second year in a row.</p> <p>Under Italian law the government has to take over a foundation if for two successive years its losses come to more than 30% of its assets.</p> <p>Nastasi was given 60 days to sort out the books. But past experience suggests he will be in charge for much longer. He is still running the great San Carlo opera house in Naples, which was put into special administration in August 2007. The debts of the San Carlo, whose past artistic directors include Rossini and Donizetti, had reached \u20ac19.7m.</p> <p>In July, another of the 12 leading opera houses, the Carlo Felice in Genoa, was put into special administration after a protracted crisis that ended in a court order it was unable to meet. Judges decided the foundation that runs the theatre should pay compensation for lost welfare payments of about \u20ac4m to around 60 employees and former employees.</p> <p>The mayor of Verona, Flavio Tosi, a member of the populist Northern League, played down the government's decision to take over the city's opera house as \"technical\" and \"automatic\". Tosi, who replaced the last administrator with one close to the League, blamed the crisis on the \"planning of the previous administration\".</p> <p>But Paola Fontecedro, the foundation's chief press officer, noted that the theatre had \"considerable debts\" from as far back as 2003. \"It is more that the state continues to reduce its contribution to the fund [which subsidises the performing arts] at a time when sponsorship is drying up,\" she said. The cuts introduced by the last Berlusconi administration were meant to be balanced by an influx of private cash.</p> <p>In the first year that the Arena foundation introduced sponsorship \"there was a pile of money\", Fontecedro said. \"The Banca di Verona, for example, initially contributed \u20ac2m a year. Now, that's down to \u20ac500,000.\"</p> <p>Giuseppe Ferrazza, the commissioner at the Carlo Felice, said this month: \"The government must decide to do something for the opera foundations. They cannot operate like this.\"</p> <p>Italy's economy has grown only spasmodically since the late 1990s. So the crisis in the nation's most beloved art form is, to a large extent, a symptom of broader woes. But that is not the whole story.</p> <p>The world of Italian opera is regularly racked by internal warfare. Desperately needed government funds have been held up for almost three years by the failure to agree a new, industry-wide contract. Last year there was a strike at the opening of the season.</p> <p>Commenting on the crisis at the Arena, the daily La Stampa recalled that its summer performances drew audiences of up to 16,000. That such a company should rack up debts of \u20ac20m was, it said, \"seemingly inexplicable\".</p>",

  "<p>Stories about climate change are generally depressing: melting ice sheets, more intense hurricanes and species vanishing as humans steadily push up the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. But out of the impending gloom has come the promise of technology to slow or even reverse some of the decline. </p> <p>In its simplest form, clean (or green) technology is anything that helps consumers or industries to use basic materials such as energy, water and waste more efficiently and, while using it, lessen their environmental footprint. Unlike IT, biotech or telecommunications, there is no agreed definition of \"cleantech\" but it is a hot area, thanks to heightened awareness of climate change and the rising cost of fossil fuels. </p> <p>And it is poised for a boom: according to the analysts Library House, venture capital investment in European cleantech companies went from \u00a3407m in 2006 to \u00a3805m last year. Ben Goldsmith of WHEB Ventures, an investment firm specialising in environmental businesses, says that globally the figures are even more impressive: \"around $850m in 2004 against $6bn in 2007\".</p> <p>Clean technology represents more of a theme than a specific sector, says Patrick Sheehan, a partner at the Environmental Technologies Fund. He says that waves of investment in the arena have come and gone for more than 20 years, and identifies the most recent as starting with investors in the US, mainly those used to dealing with technological startups in Silicon Valley, around 2004.</p> <p><strong>Changing views</strong> </p> <p>At the time, there was a debate among environmentalists on how to pitch the problem of climate change to the public. \"There was a shift from the negative \u2013 we've got to stop climate change happening and it'll be a disaster and we've got to stop flying on holiday \u2013 to the positive \u2013 we can build a whole new industry around efficiency and a low-carbon economy,\" says Goldsmith.<br>In Europe, governments were sympathetic to the green cause. </p> <p>\"Europe has a pretty rich heritage of environmental awareness and concern from Scandinavia downwards, and that's enabled legislators to begin to do something about it,\" says Sheehan. Mechanisms such as the EU's emissions trading scheme, which allows companies to trade permits to emit carbon dioxide as part of their work, have helped improve the economic viability of (generally more expensive) clean technologies.</p> <p>Also key were the globetrotting efforts of Al Gore and the highly regarded economic analysis of the impacts of a warming world by Nicholas Stern in 2006. \"In the space of the last two years, climate change has moved from the periphery to the mainstream and oil prices have become a major concern. Energy security has become a major issue and you've got, from Europe, a whole raft of legislation around these subjects,\" says Sheehan. <br>Enter the investment funds. \"There are those that see cleantech just as renewable energy,\" says Goldsmith. </p> <p>\"If you look at some of the large US west coast venture funds, who perhaps have their expertise in semiconductors and IT technologies, they can more easily move their focus to things like solar PV and the high-tech renewable energy stuff.\"</p> <p><strong>Linking the chain</strong></p> <p>Library House, in collaboration with the Carbon Trust, proposes the idea that cleantech can be divided into four parts along the energy chain: the discovery and development of new energy sources; generation of clean power; the infrastructure needed to store and distribute energy; and, finally, more efficient use of energy by consumers.</p> <p>Much of the first part of the spectrum relates to biofuels. In most cases, this refers to biodiesel or bioethanol currently made from food crops such as corn, sugarcane and rapeseed \u2013 collectively known as first-generation biofuels. \"Next-generation biofuels will be able to use a wider range of organic material or biomass including current waste material,\" says Richard White, a senior analyst at Library House. </p> <p>\"This will lead to a much greater yield of fuel per square metre of crop, and potentially the ability to grow biofuels where food crops would not grow, alleviating many of the criticisms associated with current biofuel.\"</p> <p>The next part of the energy chain, developing cleaner energy sources, is probably the most familiar to those outside the cleantech world. This includes extraction of energy from renewable sources such as the wind, sun and sea. The British government has committed to source 15% of its primary energy from renewable sources by 2020; that's around 40% of the country's electricity.</p> <p><strong>The tide is high</strong></p> <p>Wind turbines are a relatively mature technology, with several gigawatts of farms in planning stages around the UK. In addition, the country has high hopes for tidal power \u2013 experts estimate there could be up to 15GW of reliable power waiting to be harvested, and the Carbon Trust estimates that the global opportunities in the field could be up to \u00a3600bn. \"For the UK, the group of wet renewables \u2013 offshore wind, tidal stream and wave \u2013 are where the UK can have a global leadership role,\" said Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace UK.</p> <p>Solar power is one of the most established clean technology industries, but efficiency and manufacturing costs need to improve. Current solar panels rely on relatively expensive silicon chips but cutting-edge research includes work on ways to concentrate light, applying thin films of light absorbers to flexible surfaces and using nanotechnology to manipulate materials so that they can better harness the energy from the sun.</p> <p>Energy storage is also key when increasing amounts of power are generated from intermittent sources. \"When energy is produced and not required, it can be stored and released in periods of high demand or when the sun is not shining,\" said White. </p> <p>Further along the chain, better distribution and management of energy \u2013 the \"smart grid\" \u00ad\u00ad\u2013 will lead to more efficiency. \"The smart grid allows energy generators (power stations, solar farms) and consuming loads (your kettle, TV, etc) to interact with each other in real time, in both directions, with the aid of modern communications technology,\" says White.</p> <p>At end of the energy chain are developments based on more efficient use of power. These range from better insulation for buildings, through more efficient electronics in appliances, to improved monitoring of energy, using smart meters. \"Some of the companies in this field may be semiconductor companies at heart, but their developments have the potential for huge energy savings, giving them cleantech credentials,\" said White. </p> <p>\"Common devices such as televisions, lighting, fridges and computers all contribute significantly to energy use, and there is significant room for innovation to curb consumption in these areas.\" Greener transport (electric cars, fuel cells and other hybrids) also falls into this final bracket.</p> <p><strong>Broad spectrum</strong></p> <p>Besides the spectrum outlined by Library House, Goldsmith adds the efficient use of other resources such as technologies to handle the re-use of waste, water efficiency, pipelines and agricultural water use. \"Cleantech is learning to live within the resources of the planet,\" he says.</p> <p>But it will not all be plain sailing for the new climate-saving industries. Big projects can be hamstrung by local problems \u2013 such as wind farms in the UK held up for up to a decade by planning and grid connection hassles. And carbon-intensive markets also lack pull for new, green technologies. </p> <p>\"We can't generalise from IT, mobiles and so on, where they were offering new functionality in an essentially unregulated area, and translate that over to energy where there are incumbents who have been performing these functions as cheaply as they can in a market driven by cost,\" said Parr. \"It's going to need some political drive and will to re-arrange the deckchairs so that new technologies are in with a shout.\"</p> <p>Sheehan reckons it will take only a few years for clean technology to make up the largest chunk of the investors' money. \"We're at the early stages of some profound changes and there will be some new technologies that will surprise people... I've been in venture capital since 1985 and where we are now in cleantech reminds me of where we were in the IT sector in the early 1990s: at the start of a very long growth period.\"</p>",
  "<p><br><strong>Last year's Born Survivor was hit by revelations that some scenes were set up. How can we ever believe the new series is real?</strong></p> <p>The headlines are more exciting than the truth. Channel 4 and Discovery wouldn't come back so strongly if all of them were true. What you see on telly now is 100% what it is. Yes, I'll stay in a lodge with the crew but when I film the live nights out, I have to stay out. The show is 100% transparent and it has to be.</p> <p><strong>Have you changed the way the show is made?</strong></p> <p>If we're collecting firewood and I say to the crew, \"Help me get some firewood,\" I have to now say, \"The crew are helping me get firewood.\" Our mistake was that we didn't say that enough in the first series. I'm really sorry I didn't say, \"Somebody's helping me collect firewood.\" I've spent three and a half years with the SAS, I've climbed big mountains, and the most dangerous stuff I've done has been with this programme - wrestling and killing alligators, being bitten by snakes, jumping on man-eating tiger sharks.</p> <p><strong>Did you worry that your TV career might be over?</strong></p> <p>I've never really had a TV career. I've been a soldier and a climber. I said no to the Born Survivor producer three times because I've never aspired to be a TV man. I didn't feel I was slick enough, good-looking enough and smiley enough. I'm really glad I didn't say no a fourth time. It's been a real privilege. It's good entertainment, it's saved lives in America and it's encouraging kids around the world to get outdoors and follow their dreams. For years I've cringed reading articles saying \"SAS Hero Conquers Next Expedition\". I'm not that superhero. In the same way, I'm not that superbaddie eating blueberry pancakes in a hotel.</p> <p><strong>In the new series I like the moment in Namibia when you are shown killing a puff adder and eating it raw. So that scene now is totally as it happens?</strong></p> <p>No, that was a remote-control puff adder. Of course it's a fucking ... you know!</p> <p><strong>And you actually kill it yourself?</strong></p> <p>What do you think you're seeing, a stuntman? I don't find killing and eating snakes difficult.</p> <p><strong>Did you have any problems killing the porcupine later on? There's quite a death toll in that episode. Isn't it cruel to animals?</strong></p> <p>Well, maybe. It's a survival show. I could go to Safeway and get you a porcupine steak but if you're trying to dig out a porcupine and stay alive because your plane has crashed in the middle of the desert, I'm showing you how you do it. Those San Bushmen were digging out porcupines every day. That porcupine fed the whole village and me for that whole night. Nobody wants gratuitous, unnecessary killing but the series is showing people how to survive if your life is on the line and it's you or the porcupine.</p> <p><strong>So it isn't killing for TV entertainment.</strong></p> <p>No. Yes, it's entertaining TV, but it shows people how to survive when the shit has hit the fan and you've got to eat this grub.</p> <p><strong>Who has inspired you?</strong></p> <p>I always wanted to be Robin Hood or John the Baptist when I was growing up. My dad was a huge hero for me because he was a wicked climber and Ranulph Fiennes is really influential.</p> <p><strong>Your great TV rival Ray Mears called you a boy scout.</strong></p> <p>I love boy scouts. One of the best things this country has ever done is boy scouts. I love Ray Mears. He's brilliant. He's so rude about me in the press, it's outrageous!</p> <p><strong>Who is tougher. You or Ray?</strong></p> <p>He's much tougher! There aren't many of us doing these adventures and we need to look out for each other. Ray has given me a bit of a grilling in the press. I know all the inside stories because we've had the same crew on a lot of things so I could really go to town but I don't want to. He's a great guy and he does a great job.</p> <p><strong>The series is big in America. Are you the new Steve Irwin there?</strong></p> <p>He was such a dude. In the new series, I was dropped on to an island in Indonesia and I was spear fishing. I caught a stingray and we ate it on the beach. That was one back for Steve.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Born Survivor: Bear Grylls is on the Discovery Channel from September 23, Channel 4 from October 5</p>",
  "<p>Airports operator BAA put Gatwick up for sale yesterday and paved the way for a politically charged auction by admitting it expects interest from state-backed foreign investors.</p> <p>Colin Matthews, the chief executive of Britain's largest airport owner, said sovereign wealth funds were likely bidders for the \u00a32bn business as the credit crisis has limited financing options for private equity and infrastructure funds.</p> <p>\"Every observer of the market knows where the money is, and I am sure that sovereign wealth funds would be one of the groups interested,\" Matthews said.</p> <p>Some of the wealthiest and most active funds, including Abu Dhabi Investment Capital, the Investment Corporation of Dubai and the Kuwait Investment Authority, are based in the Middle East.</p> <p>Louise Ellman MP, the Labour chair of the transport select committee, told the Guardian that selling the UK's second largest airport to a Middle Eastern investor would raise \"concerns\".</p> <p>\"This all seems to be a bit rushed. I think there would be a concern if there was a rush and a Middle Eastern interest bought Gatwick to the exclusion of a local business ... In the current international situation there would be concerns about a Middle Eastern interest having control over major transport and aviation infrastructure.\"</p> <p>BAA has been under foreign control since 2006, when it was bought by a consortium called Airport Development and Investment (ADI) in a largely debt-funded \u00a310.3bn deal. ADI's majority shareholder is Ferrovial, the Spanish infrastructure and construction conglomerate, with minority shareholdings owned by Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec, the Canadian pensions fund, and GIC Special Investments, a private equity company owned by the Singaporean government. </p> <p>News of the Gatwick sale prompted public expressions of interest from Manchester Airport Group (MAG); Fraport, the owner of Frankfurt airport; Hochtief, a German group that operates airports in Athens, Sydney and Budapest; Peel Airports, owner of Liverpool John Lennon airport; Global Infrastructure Partners, an investment fund co-founded by General Electric and Credit Suisse; and Virgin Atlantic. Babcock &amp; Brown, an Australian investment firm, is also believed to be interested. MAG, which is owned by local authorities, said yesterday that it was interested in discussing a consortium bid with sovereign wealth investors, but it would demand operational control. </p> <p>Matthews said the continuing inquiry into BAA by the competition commission was a \"big chunk of the motivation\" in putting Gatwick up for sale. In a provisional report last month, the commission said selling two of BAA's three London airports and either Glasgow or Edinburgh airport in Scotland could improve services.</p> <p>\"There is no point in waiting for another announcement,\" said Matthews. The final decision is next year. BAA also owns Heathrow and Stansted. He admitted public pressure had contributed to the decision to sell. \"A sense from BAA that we are blindly defending the status quo is not a smart way to deal with that. BAA is not refusing to listen to a widespread public conviction that it is time for a change.\"</p> <p>EasyJet, Gatwick's largest airline, said a sale would not deliver on its demand to reduce in landing fees, because the business would remain a local monopoly. \"Monopoly providers of nationally important infrastructure always need to be regulated to prevent irresponsible price gouging,\" said easyJet.</p> <p>Michael O'Leary, the chief executive of Ryanair, accused BAA of attempting to dissuade the competition commission from demanding a fundamental break-up by selling off Gatwick. \"Airlines and passengers have been abused for many years with high prices and abysmal service at all of the BAA's London and Scottish airports ... the trick of selling off Gatwick won't end this abusive monopoly.\" </p> <p>Matthews said the airport operator would continue to argue against selling Stansted and one of its Scottish airports. He said BAA should oversee the expansion of Stansted and Heathrow, because it has the expertise and financial firepower. \"Reasonable observers would recognise that capacity is more important than the question of ownership.\"</p> <p>Gatwick is prohibited from building a second runway until 2019 under the terms of an agreement with West Sussex council, but new owners might explore ways of overturning that deal. Regulators put Gatwick's value at \u00a32bn. However, British Airways moved several long-haul services to Heathrow this year, and the insolvency of Zoom and XL Airways has also hit Gatwick's income. Gatwick is the world's busiest single runway airport and handled 35 million passengers last year.</p> <h2>Backstory</h2> <p>BAA yesterday made an assertive move to determine its future, but its fate remains in the hands of the <strong>Competition Commission</strong>. Last month, the commission said it had found competition problems at all seven of BAA's airports and <strong>forced disposals </strong>were the best solution.

  "<p>A \u00a312bn takeover of Britain's biggest lender, HBOS, failed to halt the deepening crisis in world financial markets last night, as a wave of fresh speculation on global stock markets saw two of Wall Street's most prestigious investment banks targeted as the latest victims of the credit crunch.</p> <p>On a day of frenetic activity and unfolding drama, shares in the City fell for a third day and Wall Street had a steep decline, despite attempts to restore calm through the takeover of HBOS by Lloyds TSB and the nationalisation of the US insurance giant AIG.</p> <p>The FTSE 100 index dropped more than 2% to close at 4912.4, its lowest level for more than three years. In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average closed down 449 points at 10,609, 25% below its peak in October last year. The price of gold rose 11% in its biggest ever one-day gain as investors searched for havens.</p> <p>Gordon Brown intervened to broker a solution to HBOS, and Downing Street made clear it was prepared to rip up competition laws to allow the takeover - a move which may cause the loss of tens of thousands of jobs and the closure of up to 500 branches. After intense negotiations, a deal was clinched shortly after 9.30pm, and is to be announced this morning. The two companies agreed that Lloyds TSB would pay 232p per HBOS share.</p> <p>Earlier, in an extraordinary day of trading for HBOS, shares in the bank halved in the first hour and at one stage stood at 88p. This sell-off led to news coming out of the proposed takeover, part of a contingency plan by the government to prevent a repeat of the Northern Rock fiasco. HBOS shares leaped above their opening level briefly, before another sell-off and closing the day down 20%.</p> <p>Other banks were also caught in the turmoil. Royal Bank of Scotland fell 10%.</p> <p>By the close of business:</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Shares in Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs had been pummelled. The two remaining investment banks after the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the takeover of Merrill Lynch faced questions about their ability to withstand the global turmoil. Shares in Goldman Sachs were down 19%. Morgan Stanley had a 24% decline, causing its chief executive, John Mack, to attack \"irresponsible\" speculators for spreading fear and rumour.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Dow Jones industrial average fell almost 4%, leading the securities and exchange commission - the US financial watchdog - to announce a clampdown on short-selling of shares, a process whereby speculators borrow stock in order to sell it and then buy it back at a lower price.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Bank of England announced that it was extending its special liquidity scheme, which is intended to ease pressures on banks, until the end of January. Until this week's turmoil in the markets, Mervyn King, the Bank's governor, had insisted that the facility, introduced in the wake of the collapse of Bear Stearns in the spring, would be closed next month.</p> <p>The announcement came as government figures showed a 32,500 rise in the number of people out of work and claiming benefit last month, the biggest increase for 16 years.</p> <p>A terse statement to the stock exchange by HBOS at lunchtime confirmed that it was in merger talks with Lloyds TSB: \"In the light of market speculation, the board of HBOS confirms it is in advanced talks with Lloyds TSB which may or may not lead to an offer being made for HBOS.\" Lloyds TSB made no comment on the proposed deal then, but it was understood that its chairman, Sir Victor Blank, and chief executive, Eric Daniels, would be at the helm of the newly merged company.</p> <p>City sources said last night that the relatively small amount of cash withdrawals from HBOS - amounting to \u00a31bn of its \u00a3250bn of deposits - showed that the bank was fundamentally sound but had fallen foul of a collective loss of investor confidence in the banking industry.</p> <p>A link-up between the two high street banks would normally fall foul of Britain's tough competition laws, but the Treasury made clear that John Hutton, the business and enterprise secretary, would use emergency powers to stop it being referred to the Competition Commission. Government sources said the severity of the crisis meant there was no alternative but to waive competition rules.</p> <p>HBOS, which owns Halifax, insisted on Tuesday it was not in trouble, but is seen by the markets as particularly vulnerable to the fall in UK house prices. The bank has 22 million customers, accounts for 20% of the mortgage market, and takes in one pound in every six saved in the UK.</p> <p>The US authorities were last night scrutinising the health of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley following a 10-day period in which they have nationalised the country's two biggest lenders - Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac - refused to bail out Lehman Brothers, helped orchestrate the takeover of Merrill Lynch, and provided an $85bn lifeline to AIG, whose failure would have sent shockwaves through the global financial system. The insurer said it would be business as usual, albeit under government control.</p> <p>New York state's insurance superintendent, Eric Dinallo, who helped broker the bailout, accused firms of poor management in diversifying far too broadly.</p> <p>\"It is clear to me that financial services and insurance has gotten away from its core competence and that is dangerous,\" said Dinallo, who compared such companies' strategies to driving a car while putting on make-up, looking at a BlackBerry and having a conversation.</p>",
  "<p>The Premier League has formally raised concerns with government over its inability to perform background checks on potential club owners. So worried has the league been over its gates being open to a tide of shady new owners hiding behind a network of brassplate companies that it asked for assistance from the Treasury.</p> <p>The subject was on the agenda at a top-level meeting between the Premier League chief executive, Richard Scudamore, and the then chief secretary to the Treasury, Andy Burnham, as far back as 12 months ago. The news emerges after the Guardian made a freedom-of-information request to the Treasury.</p> <p>Burnham's briefing notes read: \"Concerns have been raised, in particular, over the fact that companies registered in overseas tax havens are under no legal obligations to reveal their owners ... Thus, if they become involved in football, no checks can be carried out to determine if the owners are fit-and-proper persons to run football clubs or whether there are any conflicts of interest.\"</p> <p>Burnham, now culture secretary, himself called on the Football Association and the league to widen its fit-and-proper-persons test and prevent owners from loading clubs with debt. But it is clear from the league's private cry for help that it is having difficulty in enforcing even its current regulations.</p> <p>There are private frustrations within the league at the lack of cooperation from government on the issue. Despite the money-laundering implications, there has so far been no inclination to introduce a statutory requirement for a crackdown on investor anonymity.</p> <h2>Crunch time at United</h2> <p>The anticipated impact at Manchester United of the financial difficulties suffered by their \u00a314m-a-year shirt sponsor, AIG, could be the least of the worries of Malcolm Glazer, below. The US Federal Reserve, which effectively took over the troubled insurance giant with an $85bn (\u00a347bn) refinancing yesterday, will not consider sports sponsorship a core activity. But as the credit crisis bites ever deeper, United's owners have personally run up a $150m bill in the so-called \"PIK\" loans whose interest is accruing at 14.25% a year. Although it is safe to assume that the influential football dealmaker Keith Harris, a fervent United fan, is seeking a buyer for the club, a spokesman for the family countered: \"The investment is for the long term.\" </p> <h2>Failure of communication</h2> <p>Richard Prescott's reinvention this week as head of the England team's media affairs at the RFU has put the focus back on the equivalent situation at the Football Association. A Soho Square strategy document issued in May outlined the need for a single head of communications and public affairs who would oversee a communications department that included a dedicated England press chief. Recognising that a succession of England managers have considered the current director of communications, Adrian Bevington, their most outstanding media chaperone, he had widely been expected to take on that role. But four months on from the FA's announcement of its Vision 2008-2012 and no position has been advertised. Bevington remains in his previous post and no one at the FA would confirm whether this element of the wide-ranging strategy has been kicked into the long grass.</p> <h2>BBC's Olympian strength</h2> <p>After Roger Mosey stepped down from his position as the BBC's head of sport to become overlord of its 2012 Olympics coverage on Monday, the corporation is set to roll out a recruitment drive for key executives to run the London 2012 output. The appointments process will begin once Mark Byford, the deputy director-general who is head of the BBC's 2012 coordinating group, returns from Beijing tomorrow. Auntie is acutely aware that the London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games has 220 full-time employees working on delivering the Games. But although it sent 437 of its staff to Beijing, the BBC is taking steps to address what it considers to be an under-resourced area for 2012. </p>",
  "<p>The events of this week mark a milestone in Zimbabwe's history. The Harare agreement is a breakthrough that represents the country's last, best chance of averting apocalypse. Sceptics insist that the deal cannot work; but for millions of suffering Zimbabweans, it is a sweet tea. And the risk is now that the international community might inadvertently undermine this source of hope.</p> <p>It will not be easy to make this deal work; and MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai, Zimbabwe's new prime minister, has no illusions about the size of the task facing him. In yesterday's Guardian interview he spoke of the \"inherent suspicion\" between the reluctant partners. He also pointed out that not only would he have to handle Robert Mugabe and the Zanu-PF, but that he might also face opposition from MDC hardliners who want no truck with the Zanu-PF elite. </p> <p>Tsvangirai will also have to gain the respect of the generals, without becoming one of them. Sooner or later, though he will have to make a decision on whether to persuade the military top brass to stand down, or order them to do so. A clash between Tsvangirai and the military is looming, and how he handles it will be essential to his political survival. His other immediate priorities will be to bring food, water, sanitation and medicine to the people; reforming the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe; and repealing repressive legislation. </p> <p>The role of the international community is crucial to the survival of the new unity government, and there is an expectation that the MDC can deliver on foreign investment. But so far the European Union, the United States, the World Bank and International Monetary Fund have given a tepid welcome to the deal, and have stated that the new government must \"prove itself\". </p> <p>What they really mean is that they are upset Mugabe is still in the picture, and they will not provide aid until Tsvangirai ousts him. Although this response is not unexpected given the decade of hostility between the west and Zanu-PF, it is wrong. The west has to abandon this orthodoxy of demonisation, which ignores the obvious. First, without aid, Zimbabwe will die. Second, the goalposts of Zimbabwe's politics have irrevocably shifted. Although the agreement is notionally about power-sharing, in reality it sets the seal on the transition of power. The process will be lengthy, and fractious, but there can be no going back: Zimbabwe is entering a new era of leadership. Third, Tsvangirai and the MDC have already \"proved\" themselves - and they carry the scars of struggle to prove this. </p> <p>Without donor aid, the Harare agreement will become merely a political armistice, a brief interlude in Zimbabwe's civil war. If Tsvangirai is unable to persuade the donors to unlock their vaults, his usefulness - and shelf-life - will be brief. Failure by the international community to recognise the new government, and make at least a symbolic investment, would be to misinterpret Zimbabwean realpolitik and could only be destructive. Mugabe remains a major part of Zimbabwe's political landscape. His time is passing, but he cannot be wished away - and Zanu-PF still holds the knife by the handle. </p> <p>Tsvangirai, and in turn the Zimbabwean people, should not be punished for signing a deal with Mugabe. Western governments are right to worry about continued violence and corruption in Zimbabwe, and they cannot dispense aid willy-nilly, especially during this economic downturn. But the country needs aid, and it needs it now.</p> <p>The west and Zanu-PF will also have to re-establish a relationship. Driving Mugabe underground will only encourage a lethal Zanu-PF unilateralism. Travel sanctions on the Zanu-PF elite will remain in force, but there is no reason why meetings cannot be held in Zimbabwe, or on neutral territory. Just as Zanu-PF and the MDC have formed a government of national unity, so too does the international community have to take an inclusive, not sectarian approach to Zimbabwe's politics of reconstruction. Zanu-PF, in turn, must demonstrate that it is no longer addicted to violence. </p> <p>Britain and Zimbabwe do have a \"special relationship\": to pretend otherwise is facile. The relationship has often been acrimonious, and it is laden with a deep mistrust about the colonial past and recent history; but it can be salvaged and reformulated in ways that are mutually beneficial and not exploitative.</p> <p>None of the signatories to this agreement got everything they wanted, but Zimbabweans got what we needed: hope. It is ordinary Zimbabweans of all races, not the political elite, who will have to empower the agreement for it to work. After years of blood, sweat and tears, Zimbabwe finally has a deal - but we will need the world's help to give peace a chance. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Knox Chitiyo is head of the Africa programme at the Royal United Services Institute, London, and a former co-director of the Centre for Defence Studies at the University of Zimbabwe <a href=\"mailto:knoxc@rusi.org\">knoxc@rusi.org</a></p>",
  "<p>Slavenka Drakulic's article caused dismay in Croatia, especially among younger people who cannot recognise the country she describes as \"showing the world only its pretty summer face but keeping its dubious values hidden\" (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/29/balkans\">Shadows in the sunshine</a>, August 29). Drakulic claims that there is in Croatia a refusal to let its fascist past go - in 1941-45 the country was run by the pro-Nazi Ustashe - and asks whether this makes it unsuitable for EU membership.</p> <p>But the past is not hidden. Everything Drakulic complains of is on the public record and, more importantly, debated. And her examples of reverence for Zvonko Busic, jailed in the US for pro-Croatian terrorism, and at the funeral of the war criminal Dinko Sakic need to be put into perspective. Busic was indeed \"welcomed by pro-Ustashe supporters who hailed him with the traditional fascist salute\", but his terrorism was more than 32 years ago. Sakic was unrepentant, but no one has committed Nazi crimes of that sort since the second world war. A few diehards who remember their feats as glorious do not indict an entire nation.</p> <p>Drakulic was persecuted and harassed under the rightwing nationalist government of Franjo Tudjman in the 1990s, and it seems she is still fighting these battles. But Croatia has changed since she left the country to live in Sweden. I have been visiting the country for a decade, after becoming the son-in-law of one of Croatia's foremost dissidents, and the debates today are about the proper uses of law and the need to enter Europe.</p> <p>The only contemporary example Drakulic raises to support her claims of a Croatia still in its Ustashe days is the pop singer Thompson - \"whose audiences, dressed in clothes adorned with Ustashe symbols, habitually raise their hands in a fascist salute\". But, as Drakulic says, the Croatian president refused to attend a tennis tournament because Thompson was due to play in the same town; and although Drakulic says \"some ministers attend Thompson's concerts\", this summer the senior minister Jadranka Kosor pointedly told Thompson to grow up. </p> <p>It's true that there is a debate as to whether Thompson should be prosecuted and that, as Drakulic says, the Croatian Helsinki Committee defended his right to free expression. But that's the debate that occurs in all EU countries: where to draw the line between free expression and hate speech.</p> <p>Drakulic says Croatia still harbours the mentality that \"fighters for the 'national cause' cannot by definition be criminals\". But not all such fighters were pro-Ustashe, and Croatia made a huge breakthrough against this mentality by surrendering Ante Gotovina to The Hague. </p> <p>What Drakulic misses is the outpouring of a new, vibrant culture. Writers like Zoran Feric have a cosmopolitan wit and sense of absurdity. She misses the contributions of other dissidents from her era, like Vlado Gotovac and Vlado Primorac. She has not seen on the Zagreb streets the children of mixed marriages - Chinese, Indian, African - all of whom make Croatia more pluralistic. What Croatia needs to encourage and cement all this is not exclusion from Europe, but speedy integration.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Stephen Chan is a professor of international relations at the School of Oriental and African Studies, London </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:sc5@soas.ac.uk\">sc5@soas.ac.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>More than 6,000 Chinese babies have been taken ill and three have died after being fed contaminated milk formula, with the scandal deepening as it was revealed that a fifth of China's infant formula producers have made tainted powder.</p> <p>Local officials knew about the problem for more than a month before they alerted central authorities, it emerged yesterday.</p> <p>The safety scare began last week with reports that dozens of babies in Gansu province had developed kidney stones after drinking a formula that contained melamine, a chemical normally used in plastics. Officials said that subsequent tests found affected batches at 22 of China's 109 milk powder manufacturers, including its two biggest dairies, Mengniu and Yili Industrial Group.</p> <p>The number of affected infants has soared. The health minister, Chen Zhu, said that 6,244 babies had fallen ill, 1,327 were in hospital and 158 were suffering from acute kidney failure. He expected the number of cases to rise. Chen said that so far all the sick infants had consumed milk powder made by the Sanlu group, the country's biggest formula producer.</p> <p>Li Changjiang, head of China's quality control agency, said that 5,000 inspectors would monitor companies and all dairy products would be tested for melamine.</p> <p>The chemical is banned from use in food, but adding it to watered-down milk makes the liquid appear higher in protein when tested.</p> <p>China has sought to tighten its safety regime after a number of product scares. In 2004, more than 200 infants suffered malnutrition and at least 12 died after being fed formula containing no nutrients, and an estimated 1,500 dogs and cats died in the US last year after they consumed a melamine-tainted pet food ingredient manufactured in China.</p> <p>The Sanlu case is particularly alarming because the recall took so long, and apparently required the intervention of the New Zealand government, which was alerted by Sanlu's New Zealand-based partner Fonterra. New Zealand's prime minister, Helen Clark, said on Monday that she ordered her officials to leapfrog regional authorities and inform Beijing directly.</p> <p>Yang Chongyong, deputy governor of Hebei province, where Sanlu is based, said the firm received customer complaints from March. But it was not until August 2 that it informed the city government of Shijiazhuang, the provincial capital. Officials there waited more than a month, until September 9, to inform their bosses in the provincial government. The Hebei authorities took the problem to central government the following day. Sanlu finally ordered a recall.</p> <p>Andrew Ferrier, chief executive of Fonterra, which owns 43% of Sanlu, said it had urged disclosure \"from day one\".</p> <p>The state news agency Xinhua reported that the mayor and four other city officials of Shijiazhuang had been fired. Sanlu's general manager, Tian Wenhua, was arrested. Four milk suppliers have been arrested and 22 detained.</p> <p>China is the world's second largest market for infant formula. Ding Bing, China coordinator for the World Alliance for Breastfeeding Action, said: \"The milk powder companies do advertisements which exaggerate the effects of their products and make the mothers doubt [the quality of] their own milk.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Additional research by <strong>Chen Shi</strong></p>",
  "<p>Late last week a schoolroom in central Tanzania descended into chaos after female pupils began to faint. Slumping over their exam papers or collapsing to the floor, 20 girls rapidly lost consciousness. Others sobbed, yelled and ran around the school. Such events, said the local education officer, are \"very common here\". In all likelihood, no organic cause will be found and the episode will be chalked up as yet another case of mass hysteria.</p> <p>Similar outbreaks have recently been reported in locations from Kuala Lumpur to Mexico City and rural Bangladesh. Nor is the west immune. Schools in Europe and the US have also been struck by contagions of vomiting, itching, dizziness and seizures. In fact, mass hysteria seems to be part of the human condition. And it has a rich, bizarre, and often tragic history. </p> <p>Epidemics of hysteria such as those in Tanzania rely on the power of suggestion, but they are nourished by fear, sadness and anxiety. Victims tend to be subject to severe psychological strain over the preceding weeks or months. One or more then develop a psychosomatic symptom, and those made suggestible by pent-up anxiety quickly follow suit. Before long, dozens are vomiting, fainting and screaming. The strain of exams is a common trigger. Reports suggest that in many Central African schools pupils are placed under such extreme pressure that mass hysteria has become virtually endemic. Severe discipline and emotional neglect also seem to have caused the dramatic scenes in a convent school in Mexico City last year when dozens of young girls temporarily lost the ability to walk. </p> <p>Sometimes the reaction of the authorities makes things worse. At a school in Blackburn in 1965, several girls fainted during morning assembly. Concerned that they might hurt themselves, the teachers asked them to lie down on the floor along a main corridor. This made the situation seem far more serious than it was, and other children became convinced that they too were sick. By midday, 141 pupils were experiencing dizziness, nausea, spasms and shortness of breath. Ambulances took 85 children to hospital. It took more than a week to establish that there was no underlying physical condition. </p> <p>Women and girls are nearly always over represented among the victims of these outbreaks. In fact a gender imbalance is often a giveaway that the epidemic is not organic. In more misogynistic times, this was put down to women having more fragile nerves, or wombs with a tendency to rise out of the pelvis and compress other organs. But while there may be a biological component, most experts now think that in many parts of the world, girls and women are more likely to succumb due to the frustrations of living in families and societies dominated by men. Others argue that hysteria offers distressed women a legitimate reason to \"check out\" for a while from the drudgery and indignities of daily life. </p> <p>The manner of psychological breakdowns also varies dramatically from place to place. Take the epidemic of laughing and crying that struck villages west of Lake Victoria in 1962. It began at a mission school when 95 out of 159 girls succumbed to the same painful compulsion to laugh and sob by turns. The authorities sent the children back to their villages, which spread the psychic contagion to the adult population. Victims laughed for about a week on average - hundreds of people were affected before the epidemic receded the following year. </p> <p>A medical team visited the region to study blood, water and food under the microscope. Drawing a blank, they concluded that the sufferers were victims of heightened suggestibility. The schoolchildren had been preparing for important exams and, in those fraught post-independence years, many of their parents were anxious about their region's future. To the doctors who studied the laughter epidemic the events were reminiscent of a far stranger and darker phenomenon: the dancing plague. </p> <p>Perhaps the most bizarre of all mass hysterias, dancing plagues illustrate how the expression of mass hysteria can be shaped by the experiences and beliefs of its victims. On about half a dozen occasions between 1017 and 1518, bouts of uncontrollable dancing struck parts of Germany, Switzerland, France and the Low Countries. Hundreds were consumed by an irresistible urge to dance, hop and leap into the air. </p> <p>Chronicles of 1374 tell of large numbers of men and women dancing, while screeching with pain, leaping into the air, running wildly from place to place, and calling on the mercy of God and the saints. In the year 1518, about 400 citizens of Strasbourg danced for days or weeks in succession. This time the authorities intensified the epidemic by encouraging the afflicted to keep dancing in the misguided belief that doing so would cure them. They had the dancers taken to a specially constructed stage where musicians played pipes and drums and hired dancers held them tight to prevent them from flagging. Soon people were dying of exhaustion. </p> <p>As is typical of episodes of mass hysteria, those afflicted were suffering acute physical and mental distress. The 1374 outbreak occurred just after a devastating flood. During another outbreak in 1518, the inhabitants of Strasbourg were reeling from severe famine, their morale already shattered by syphilis, smallpox and plague. They danced in their misery because people living along the Rhine and Moselle rivers had a longstanding fear of devils and saints who inflicted a terrible, compulsive dance. Having fallen into a trance state, they acted in accordance with these supernaturalist beliefs: dancing wildly for days on end. </p> <p>Supernaturalism has fuelled most flamboyant cases of mass hysteria. Nuns living in austere convents between the 1500s and 1700s were especially prone. Convinced that they had been possessed by demons, unhappy nuns would enter a trance, and proceed to writhe, convulse, laugh, speak in strange tongues, smash crucifixes, thrust out their hips, and make other lewd gestures and propositions. The sociologist Robert E Bartholomew tells of one episode in which several nuns, who presumably saw cats as Satanic familiars, \"meowed together every day at a certain time for several hours together\". In 1749, a contagion of squirming, screaming and trance spread through a German convent; locals inferred the work of a witch, seized a nun as a likely candidate and beheaded her in the marketplace. </p> <p>In modern Singapore and Malaysia, factory workers are often rural migrants who share traditional beliefs about spirits and possession. When a worker, unable to cope with the factory regime, plunges into an altered state, others perceive the action of evil spirits and, in consequence, reproduce the symptoms. Such outbreaks are often brought to an end with the ritual sacrificing of a goat. </p> <p>Epidemics of odd behaviour can also afflict the fully conscious. A striking example is koro. Thousands of men in south-east Asia and China, in times of economic uncertainty, can come to believe that their penises are shrinking into their bodies and that death will ensue if they become fully retracted. The victims of penis panics arrive at medical clinics clutching their genitals, or use pegs, clamps, even needles, to prevent further shrinkage. In China, where koro last appeared in 1985, there is a widespread fear of a fox spirit that roams the land in search of male victims. </p> <p>It takes only the right kind of fear, suggestion and false belief to trigger epidemic hysteria or mass delusions. So as our fears change, so do expressions of mass hysteria. Following the use of poison gas in the first world war, residents of rural Virginia began to report unpleasant physical reactions to noxious gases said to have been released into their homes by a \"mad gasser\". It turned out that anxious locals had fallen sick after misconstruing the smells caused by backed-up flues and even flatulence. A similar wave of nausea and dizziness occurred in a Rhode Island elementary school during the first Gulf war in response to media speculation about possible chemical weapon attacks on Israel. </p> <p>Outbreaks of hysteria closely track real threats and involve credible sets of symptoms. Experts such as Bartholomew and Simon Wessley...#65279; have shown how escalating fears of terrorist attacks have led to an upsurge in physical reactions to harmless powders in envelopes and innocuous odours in subways. </p> <p>But a dose of caution is required. If dozens of schoolchildren begin complaining of faintness, nausea and headaches it is not always time to call in a psychiatrist. When several children fell ill in a London primary school in 1990 it looked just like a case of mass hysteria. There were even more girls than boys on the sick list. But on examination of their school lunch it turned out that they had been poisoned by pesticides used on cucumbers. It seems that the girls were just better at eating their greens.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> A Time to Dance, A Time to Die: The Extraordinary Story of the Dancing Plague of 1518 by John Waller is published by Icon Books, priced \u00a312.99.

  "<h2>World Bank warning on blockade of Palestinians</h2> <p>Israeli economic restrictions were leaving Palestinians more reliant on aid than ever, the World Bank said yesterday. Its report to donor governments said talks about removing checkpoints had become a \"distraction\". The IMF believed the economy had shrunk 0.5% last year and would grow only 0.8% in 2008, with about \u00a31.06bn budget support needed this year. In peace talks, Israel and the west spoke of making significant improvements to the economy. The bank said the challenge was to \"go beyond isolated gestures towards a profound revision in the fundamentals of the economy\". <br><strong>Rory McCarthy in Jerusalem</strong></p> <h2>Prosecutors challenge ruling that cleared Zuma</h2> <p>Prosecutors said yesterday that they would appeal against a judge's ruling last Friday dismissing fraud and corruption charges against Jacob Zuma, the president of the African National Congress. Zuma's supporters have accused President Thabo Mbeki of using the corruption case to derail Zuma's political ambitions. As the ANC head, Zuma is in line to stand for president next year, when Mbeki completes his second and final term. Zuma, 66, was charged in 2005, but that case was dismissed in 2006. He was charged again last December, days after ousting Mbeki as ANC leader. <br><strong>Associated Press, Johannesburg</strong></p> <h2>Monk attempts suicide at most sacred temple</h2> <p>A Buddhist monk slashed his throat in a suicide attempt at Burma's most sacred temple, the scene of several pro-democracy protests that erupted a year ago, witnesses said yesterday. A trustee of the Shwedagon temple said the monk became desperate after running out of money to pay for medical care. It was the second suicide attempt by a monk at the pagoda this year. The temple has a history as a place for mass political gatherings, and was a focus for Buddhist monks and pro-democracy protesters last September. The trustee said the monk was in stable condition. <br><strong>Associated Press, Rangoon</strong></p> <h2>Thaksin relative is elected prime minister</h2> <p>Thailand's parliament finally elected the brother-in-law of the fugitive former leader Thaksin Shinawatra as prime minister yesterday. Somchai Wongsawat, 61, a former bureaucrat and long-serving judge who is married to Thaksin's sister, won the support of most of the six-party governing coalition's MPs. The former prime minister Samak Sundaravej was forced to quit for hosting a cookery show after taking power.

  "<p>The continuing, if not escalating, US and UK financial crisis is repeatedly punctuated in the media by failed brokers and bankers blaming it all on the fall in property prices (Banks: the contagion spreads, September 17). But it is illogical that the booming real economy should wreak havoc in the money economy. The reality is that massive amounts of our cash have been siphoned off - much of it via tax havens - to enable global gambling in impenetrable derivatives; which has so confused the regulators, auditors and the corporate world that few, if any, understand the banks' balance sheets, and have lost all track of the relationships between the real economy and the money economy.</p> <p>The alleged property \"crash\" is a tiny percentage of housing stock being auctioned off; 95% of property is not in forced sale and it retains its (real) value to the owners and tenants. And when traditional banking returns, property, land, factories and other real assets in the real world will still be the banks' main securities for loans.</p> <p>The real economy is fine. It is the money economy that needs fixing - and it is the duty of governments to fix it. <br><strong>Noel Hodson</strong><br>Oxford </p> <p>Governments worldwide have been totally complacent about the financial markets and the negative effects of globalisation. Politicians have looked at the bright side of the equation for political expediency and short-term gain.

Therefore the government has theoretically placed all our economic eggs in the one basket and has taken no notice of the need for a manufacturing sector. Let us hope therefore, like 23 scientific and economic Nobel prize winners recommended some 11 years ago, that if a new Conservative government is brought to power, it will create our economy based upon hi-tech manufacturing industries and not intangible commodities that have brought us to the dire state of affairs that we find ourselves in today. <br><strong>Dr David Hill</strong><br>Huddersfield</p> <p>We should be hearing far more about the role of the corporate credit rating agencies - mainly Standard &amp; Poor's, Moody's and Fitch - which are at the root of the current financial mayhem. Effectively in collusion with investment institutions, they devised esoteric \"Monte Carlo\" rating techniques to pass off complex and obscure financial products as being low risk when, in fact, they contained a great deal of high risk, such as sub-prime mortgages. Those involved made vast profits from the associated fees and commissions at the expense of millions of unwary investors. Unless the activities of these rating agencies and investment institutions are regulated, and investment products are made to be more transparent, history will repeat itself.<br><strong>Keith Fisher</strong><br>Oxford </p> <p>Michael Meacher's prescription for curing the financial crisis (Letters, September 16) is misguided. He advocates reintroducing Glass-Steagall, and the statutory separation of investment from commercial banking. But recent failures have not been among the integrated institutions, but have been pure investment banks (such as Lehman) or pure commercial banks (such as Northern Rock). If anything, the integrated banks appear to be best placed to weather the storms.<br><strong>Nicholas Aleksander</strong><br>London</p> <p>Where are the big ideas? It's all either deckchair arranging or gleeful celebration as the ship of state slips into the icy, black depths (Crunch time, G2, September 17). Here's a big idea - remutualisation.</p> <p>Halifax, formerly part of HBOS, was once a well run mutual building society - run for the benefit of its lenders and borrowers. Now, it's been almost destroyed for the short-term benefit of speculators and bonus-hungry managers. As failing banks come begging, the government could make remutualisation a condition of bridging loans. Other sectors, such as retail, could also be made into staff partnerships. John Lewis, for example, is the model retail organisation in the UK - its staff have an interest in making the business a success because they own it. Similarly, utilities - why should we pay more just so others can profit (including the French government in the case of EDF)? Give profits back to the users - mutualise them.</p> <p>Not communism, not capitalism, but there is a third way - mutuality!<br><strong>Keith Mason</strong><br>London</p> <p>For those of us who are neither keen on large-scale monopoly capitalism nor of state control, why can not we look towards syndicalism - workers' control. Most workers' cooperatives seem to avoid the problems of excessive payments to the rich, with typically the highest paid getting not more than seven times the salary paid to the least well off. It also avoids the extreme fluctuations in share prices when we get over-hyped optimism or pessimism.<br><strong>David Spurling</strong><br>Sittingbourne, Kent</p> <p>Having nationalised some of the world's chief financial institutions, is George Bush the biggest socialist in history?<br><strong>David Voas</strong><br>Eyam, Derbyshire</p> <p>The collection of leftwingers' comments in G2 was fascinating. However, Tony Benn reports meeting Mosley in 1928 \"when he was a Labour MP\". Benn would have been three years old in 1928 - perhaps he is even more politically gifted than I thought.<br><strong>David Spong</strong><br>Cambridge</p>",
  "<h2>Eric Daniels<br>Chief executive, Lloyds TSB</h2> <p>Born in Dillon, Montana, and known in the City as \"the quiet American\", Daniels is cautious and contained, a far cry from the caricature of the brash American banker. Aged 57 and the son of a German professor and a Chinese mother, he has spent his entire working life in banking. He was in London for three years in the late 1980s running Citi's private bank during the last property crash. Most of the 1990s was spent with US banks. He joined Lloyds as head of retail banking in 2001 when it was suffering from the ill-timed \u00a37bn acquisition of life assurer Scottish Widows two years earlier. He took the top job in 2003 and worked on turning Lloyds around. </p> <h2>Sir Victor Blank<br>Chairman of Lloyds TSB</h2> <p>Sir Victor is the epitome of the serial chairman and one of the City's most respected businessmen. His previous posts include chairman of Trinity Mirror and retail group GUS. The 65-year-old attended St Catherine's College, Oxford, then joined law firm Clifford Turner, now Clifford Chance, as a trainee in 1964. Five years later he became the firm's youngest ever partner. Blank moved into banking in the 80s, and at HSBC he was instrumental in the management buyout of Woolworths and eventually rose to be chairman. He has plenty of expertise of mergers and acquisitions, not least because he wrote the textbook Weinberg &amp; Blank on Takeovers and Mergers. </p> <h2>Andy Hornby<br>Chief executive, HBOS</h2> <p>At 42, Hornby is one of the youngest chief executives in the FTSE 100. He was poached from Asda by Halifax before it merged with Bank of Scotland. His appointment to the top job in July 2006 was a controversial choice, since he had little banking experience, having run the bank's branch network for three years. Hornby quickly made his mark, launching Halifax's now infamous attacks on the \"big four\" high-street banks, and unleashing Howard the singing bank manager, star of HBOS's memorable ads. The youngest of five children, Hornby grew up in the grounds of Bristol's Clifton prep school where his late father was headteacher. </p> <h2>Dennis Stevenson<br>Chairman, HBOS</h2> <p>The merger of the Bank of Scotland with Halifax seven years ago catapulted the 63-year-old, who had been chairman of the former building society for only two years, into the chairman's role at one of the UK's largest retail banks. The fact that the government has become involved in the HBOS debacle will hold little fear as the left-leaning peer, who once described himself as an \"unreconstructed 1960s Guardian-reading liberal\", has strong political connections and has been a Labour donor. He is also head of the commission which chooses independent members of the reformed House of Lords, and a lifelong friend of Peter Mandelson.</p>",
  "<p>People in power often admit to dreaming of what they will do when they leave office. Some dream of making millions with memoirs and speech tours, while others may want to enjoy a lie-in. But Germany's chancellor Angela Merkel has an altogether more ambitious fantasy - mastering the balance beam.</p> <p>In an interview with a women's magazine Merkel said she wished that she could be a gymnast and conquer the art of turning and leaping on the beam, the 1.25-metre-high apparatus used in women's gymnastics.</p> <p>\"I wish I could do gymnastics on the balance beam,\" she told Frau im Spiegel, adding that she would also like to brush up her French and study law. But before her critics were able to question the suitability of gymnastics for Merkel - whose physical prowess, by her own admission, stretches to walking, cross-country skiing and gardening - she added: \"I have long ago come to terms with the fact that it is not my forte.\" </p> <p>Merkel, 54, who last month was voted the most powerful woman in the world for the second time by Forbes magazine, has admitted that she was often terrified of sports lessons, especially jumping and gymnastics. </p> <p>Merkel's remarks came as she toured schools as part of her campaign to put education at the top of her government's agenda under the slogan \"no education, no prosperity\". </p> <p>A physicist who gave up science for politics nearly 20 years ago, Merkel said that physics had given her the ability to \"distinguish between what is important and what is not, and to work very precisely\".</p>",
  "<p>Two imperatives point to the urgent development of renewable energy: security of supply and controlling climate change.</p> <p>Much the largest source of renewable energy is hydroelectric power, which provides 17% of world electricity (and 6% of world energy), about the same as nuclear power; both are CO2-free. All the other renewables - wind, wave, tidal, solar, biomass (which are either CO2-free or CO-neutral) - hardly feature in the statistics at the present time.</p> <p>In a desperate attempt to reduce dependence on the twin energy drugs of oil and gas, huge efforts are being made worldwide to develop renewable sources of energy, and the EU is committed to reaching a target of 20% renewable energy by 2020, which implies 35% to 40% renewable electricity.</p> <p>The UK is third from the bottom in the EU league table, just above Luxembourg and Malta, at 1.3% (the UK's 2020 target is 15%). Sweden gets a remarkable 40% of its energy from renewables.</p> <p>This form of energy is frequently invoked by the green lobby as being the only way ahead for electricity supply, providing all that we need. This must be a case of \"Omne ignotum pro magnifico est\" (\"That which is unknown is assumed to have great potential\", to quote Tacitus). </p> <p>But engineers do know a great deal about renewable energy: first and foremost, it is expensive, and is only being developed commercially because of the provision of subsidies of various kinds. This amounted to \u00a31bn last year and will gross up to more than 20 times this figure by 2020, according to the UK's Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform. But this is currently seen as a necessary and acceptable cost for peace of mind in the fight to contain climate change, although the size of the subsidy is not always appreciated. </p> <p>A <a href=\"http://bit.ly/solarpayback\">recent report </a>by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors suggested that the payback time for solar panels is more than 100 years. Of course, as technologies mature and production gets under way, costs come down - but not always low enough to compete with hydro and nuclear. But they play a vital role in providing a source of CO2-free energy as part of the climate control portfolio of technologies.</p> <p>Solar energy is ubiquitous and gaining ground in niche markets but is also beginning to penetrate the bulk electricity market. High feed-in tariffs have allowed Germany to achieve its target of getting 100,000 roofs with solar panels generating 300 MW, a project that started in 1999 and finished in 2003. </p> <p>Wind power onshore has been successful because of marketing subsidies (the Renawables Obligation Certificates, which power generators pay to renewables operators); but even after 15 years it only provides the equivalent output of half a typical gas or nuclear station. The potential for more growth offshore is high; indeed, the government is relying on it, but someone will have to pay to hook the wind farms up to the grid. Wave and tidal stream systems are in their infancy but growing. </p> <p>The only large-scale supplier of renewable electricity would be the Severn Barrage, which is based on the proven technology demonstrated at the Rance barrage in Brittany, which has operated successfully for 40 years. It could provide 5% of UK electricity at a capital cost of \u00a31.7m per installed MW - about half of the cost of offshore wind farms.</p> <p>If a low-cost technology for storing renewable electricity could be found, it would solve the problems of intermittent wind and lack of night-time solar. A great deal of ingenuity is being brought to bear to increase renewable energy production and it is being steadily successful. But if we are to get to 15% renewable energy by 2020 it will be an expensive miracle. Any notion that renewables can provide for all our requirements is a mischievous and reckless boast that will leave us in the dark.</p> <p>\u00b7 Ian Fells is emeritus professor of energy conversion at Newcastle University and founding chairman of the <a href=\"http://www.narec.co.uk/\">New and Renewable Energy Centre </a>(NaREC) at Blyth, Northumberland.

  "<p>Used clumsily, historical hindsight can be a blunt and savage thing. Just last week, the birth control pioneer Marie Stopes was denounced as an evil eugenicist. Far from being a \"woman of distinction\" who deserves her face on a commemorative stamp, some commentators have played up the fact that she advocated compulsory sterilisation for anyone she deemed \"totally unfit for parenthood\". Even worse, in the 1930s, Stopes apparently sent some of her swoony poetry to Hitler. At a single stroke, the public servant who liberated middle- and working-class women from an endless round of unwanted childbearing had become Josef Mengele in a skirt.</p> <p>Then, on Sunday, the Church of England appeared to apologise to Charles Darwin for trying to make him look silly in the 1860s when he suggested that, far from being created in God's image, man was descended from the apes. Obviously the scientist had been right all along about the impossibility of the world coming into being in just seven hyperactive days. A spokesman for the church has since gone on Radio 4's Today to deny the apology, a gesture that only served to draw attention to the muddled way we feel about the past, not to mention its relation to the present. For if it were a toss-up between inviting Charles Darwin or Sarah \"Creationist\" Palin to dinner at Lambeth Palace any time soon, it's pretty clear which one would be the safer PR option.</p> <p>Historical revisionism has been with us as long as history itself. It is part of our impulse, as storymaking creatures, to retell the past in order to make a more satisfying sense of the present. Just think of Henry V. The late medieval sectarian thug gets turned into a Renaissance prince by Shakespeare, before becoming a righteous war leader in Olivier's 1944 film and then morphing into a troubled modern man in Kenneth Branagh's 1989 retelling. It's why Margaret Thatcher, the woman whom moderate people greeted as Britain's saviour in the 70s, became a pariah just 10 years later and yet is now welcomed at Gordon Brown's Chequers as a kind of political soul sister. </p> <p>What is new about this revisionism, however, is its poisonously self-righteous tone. It's as if we've started handing out gold stars to historical figures whose attitudes appear to chime with our own, while hissing everyone else off the stage. This is dangerous, because sooner or later some new bit of information will come along to disrupt those lovely moral certainties. For instance, Darwin's discoveries about the way the human race evolved formed the foundation for much of the later eugenics debate. Without him, there would be no Stopes. Yet to make him responsible for Hitler's final solution would be like blaming Isaac Newton every time an apple, or an aeroplane, fell out of the sky.</p> <p>Stopes herself is trickier. Born 70 years after Darwin, she was more obviously and emphatically a eugenicist. But then so were HG Wells and GB Shaw, and thousands of other thoughtful people who realised that, with the old Malthusian model of population control by disease and famine mercifully no longer working, something else would have to be done. The painful fact is that, if you were knocking around 75 years ago, you too would have a head filled with ideas which, if acted on today, would count as hate crime. That wouldn't make you bad, mad or even particularly stupid. It would simply mean you were born without the magic ability to see the future.</p> <p>Projecting a contemporary sensibility into the past has an honourable pedigree when it comes to raising laughs. It's what Life on Mars and Blackadder depend on. Whether, though, it is quite the way we should be deciding who to send to sit on history's naughty step is quite another matter.<br><a href=\"mailto:kathryn.hughes22@googlemail.com\"><br>kathryn.hughes22@googlemail.com</a></p>",
  "<p>For the four survivors in this Lancashire team from their last relegation in 2004, the county's plight must be queasily familiar. Then, as now, they had initially justified optimistic predictions of a title challenge, only to enter a headlong descent. After this latest capitulation, inside 39 overs to their lowest total in three years, it is difficult to see them avoiding the embarrassment of relegation in the Championship as well as the Pro40 league.</p> <p>Rob Key won a crucial toss, condemning Lancashire to bat first on a pitch which their groundsman, Peter Marron, admitted was underprepared as a result of the heavy rain that fell for most of Tuesday and prevented any play before lunch. Key then set his quartet of quality seamers loose, and a batting line-up which has been statistically the worst in the First Division floundered haplessly yet again.</p> <p>The pitch did not excuse Paul Horton's extravagant drive in the fourth over, which gifted Robbie Joseph the first of his three wickets, and Stuart Law, Francois du Plessis and Glen Chapple were all bowled by full, swinging deliveries from Amjad Khan, the Copenhagen-born and now England-qualified son of Pakistani parents who is battling back from a knee reconstruction.</p> <p>Geraint Jones rammed home Kent's advantage with a pugnacious 88-ball 91, although his innings was not without its uncomfortable moments: he offered difficult slip chances on 17 and 67, and took the unusual option of dashing to the public Portaloo beyond the boundary when one of his partners fell, rather than climbing into the grand, green-gabled pavilion.</p>",
  "<p>Fran\u00e7oise Demulder, a prizewinning member of the talented cohort of French female war photographers who first made their mark in Vietnam, has died of a heart attack in Paris at the age of 61. In 1977 she became the first woman to win the coveted World Press Photo of the Year award for a black-and-white picture shot during the expulsion in 1976 of Palestinians from the Karantina district of Christian East Beirut by Christian Phalangist militiamen in the Lebanese civil war.</p> <p>Fifi, as Demulder was known to colleagues, friends and officials alike, had for most of the last decade been paralysed from the waist down by a surgical error. That infirmity, borne with stoicism and good humour, contrasted with her footloose and fancy-free career as a member of the caravan of photographers and reporters who chronicled major third-world conflicts in the final third of the 20th century.</p> <p>With her French colleagues - and sometime rivals - Catherine Leroy and Christine Spengler, Demulder helped crack open the male-dominated field of war photography. They were stars of the three Paris-based agencies, Sygma, Gamma and Sipa, that in the 1970s and 80s made the French capital the centre of world photojournalism during the final golden age of European and American photo magazines.</p> <p>Her work appeared in Paris Match, Time, Newsweek, the British Sunday colour supplements and German magazines such as Stern. As well as south-east Asia and the Middle East, she covered events in Cuba, Pakistan and Ethiopia. She once said that she hated war, \"but felt compelled to document how it is always the innocent who suffer, while the powerful get richer and richer\".</p> <p>Her Beirut picture - showing a Palestinian woman pleading with a masked Phalangist armed with a second world war American carbine - came to symbolise the horrors of the wars that afflicted Lebanon for 15 years. Hundreds of Palestinians died in the Karantina operation. </p> <p>The photograph caused her professional grief because, as she told an interviewer, \"from then on it was no longer good Christians and wicked Palestinians, and the Phalangists never forgave me\". But it also ushered in an enduring friendship with the Palestine Liberation Organisation leader Yasser Arafat, then based in Beirut. It was plastered on the walls of those parts of the Lebanese capital not under Phalangist control. Ironically, the picture was initially overlooked when it reached the Gamma office in Paris, but Demulder returned from Beirut several weeks later and rescued it.</p> <p>Her first steps as a professional photographer in Saigon in the early 1970s reflected a classic on-the-job apprenticeship of a natural talent without previous formal training in photography. Born in Paris, the daughter of an electronics engineer, she worked briefly as a model after studying philosophy. But then, armed with a one-way air ticket, she and her then boyfriend took off to Vietnam on something of a lark. </p> <p>Young and fearless, she took advantage of the American military's willingness to help journalists move freely around the country. She quickly learned the basic ingredients of war photography - strong nerves and being in the right place - and with her boyfriend eked out a living by covering the fighting on a motorbike or riding on US army Huey helicopters before dropping off their pictures at the Associated Press office for perhaps a $20 fee.</p> <p>When virtually all Americans and other foreigners were evacuated from Saigon on April 30 1975, Demulder stayed behind to witness the communist victory. She wormed her way into the Independence Palace and took an exclusive picture of a North Vietnamese tank battering down its main gate. The photograph was published around the world, and and came to symbolise the American defeat.</p> <p>Demulder never lacked for male admirers, but never married. She inspired the New York Times corres-pondent Alan Cowell, author of a novel published in 2003 called A Walking Guide, to name his female protagonist Faria Duclos, a French war photographer described by a reviewer as a \"tough-as-nails French ex-model\". The following year, the former Newsweek corres-pondent Michael Alan Lerner made a woman photographer based on Demulder the war-weary love interest in his film Deadlines, set in Beirut, about the moral underside of war reporting. </p> <p>Demulder had a special fondness for animals but had little notion of keeping records, paying taxes or saving for a rainy day. She tended to spend what she earned almost as quickly as she was paid. When she fell ill with leukaemia in 2003, she was virtually penniless. Photographers the world over, including Philip Jones Griffiths, Eric Bouvet, Reza and Luc Delahaye, as well as galleries and art collectors, organised an auction of their prints in Paris, raising more than \u20ac170,000 to help pay her medical costs.</p> <p>Upon learning of her death, Christine Albanel, the French minister of culture, called her a \"remarkable woman, an artist and a witness of our times\".</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Fran\u00e7oise Demulder, photographer, born June 9 1947; died September 3 2008</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Monday September 22 2008. In the article above we mentioned a book by Alan Cowell in which a character, inspired by Demulder, shares her initials. The book is called A Walking Guide, rather than A Walking Tour.

  "<p>French police are struggling to contain a gang war in north-eastern Paris that has left one dead and several injured, as locals complain that they are being fenced into high-rise ghettoes to make way for the middle-class.</p> <p>The 19th arrondissement in northern Paris was supposed to be celebrating its renaissance this autumn with the old state funeral parlour transformed into a major new arts quarter opening next month.</p> <p>But north of the canal, a war between rival gangs on high-rise estates has escalated, with riot police moving in to control it. For 15 years, local rivalries between the Curial and Riquet estates have seen vicious knife-fights and score-settling, but now more youths are turning to \"le gun\". </p> <p>Last week a 23-year-old postman was shot dead in the street. Days afterwards, a man from a rival estate survived a shooting but was left with serious leg injuries. Yesterday, two teenagers were being treated in hospital after an attack in which one of them had his stomach slashed open with a knife, only metres from the site of the fatal shooting. </p> <p>\"There are two 19th arrondissements, the rich and us, and we're being shut away in high-rises and forgotten,\" said the mother of one teenager. </p> <p>Local youths have been reduced to the slang labels: \"black\", \"beur\" (north African) or \"feuj\", the back-to-front slang for \"juif\" or Jew. Last summer, a local Jewish teenager was left in a coma after an attack that caused President Nicolas Sarkozy to make a statement warning against antisemitism. But social workers believe the real divide is not over race or religion but geography, with streets tagged as frontiers or no-go zones and youths targeted according to the estate where they live. </p> <p>A town hall official who researched the cause of the \"war\" between the rival high-rises said he was at a loss to determine the origin of the feud - whether it was a football match gone wrong or a robbery. He likened it to an age-old family feud in Brittany - no one could remember why they were fighting any more. </p> <p>\"I don't even want to bring my three-year-old son to see my mother in case he gets shot,\" said Khedidja, 27. Her brother, Moussa, 23, was shot in the leg last week as he left his apartment block to see friends after breaking the Ramadan fast. \"People don't want to go out anymore. It's as if the estate you come from is stamped on your forehead and the others see you as the enemy. I refuse to be scared, that would mean they've won.\" </p> <p>She said neither her brother, from Cural estate, nor the murder victim, from Riquet estate, were gang leaders - they had simply been caught in the crossfire. </p> <p>\"This is nowhere near over,\" said one social worker, arguing for better education facilities and youth groups. </p> <p>While the parks and canals of the 19th arrondissement are being gentrified, the northern neighbourhoods have a high level of social housing and the highest concentration of young people in Paris. Unemployment at 17.7% is more than double the city's average. </p> <p>Hadrien Lenoir, of the group SOS Racisme, said: \"During the 2005 riots in the suburbs, violence happened on forgotten, isolated estates with no transport or infrastructure. But this is happening right near a metro station and all sorts of public services. The reason is that people have been ghettoised. Rich middle classes are moving into the south of the arrondissement pushing up prices, and everyone else is crammed into one area of high-rises with no social mixing or prospects.\"</p> <p>Mouada Abdelali, an artist who worked on youth projects, said that he had seen local French youths repeatedly stigmatised for their skin colour or immigrant descent. \"One teenager said to me: \"I hate everyone even myself\". How do you deal with that?\"</p>",
  "<p>Suicide bombers struck at the US embassy in the heart of the Yemeni capital, Sana'a, yesterday, killing 16 people in the country's worst terrorist attack in years.</p> <p>Heavy security meant that the victims were mostly Yemeni troops guarding the perimeter of the embassy compound. Non-essential staff were evacuated this year after a less serious incident. Six of the dead were the attackers. No Americans were hurt.</p> <p>The attack, involving a double car bombing and machine-gun and rocket fire, bore the hallmarks of al-Qaida, whose growing strength in the Arab world's poorest country is alarming western governments and intelligence agencies at a time when the organisation is seen as being on the defensive elsewhere in the Middle East.</p> <p>In a statement to the Agence France-Presse news agency, an unknown group called Islamic Jihad in Yemen said it carried out the Sana'a attack, which took place in the middle of the holy month of Ramadan. It also threatened to attack the British embassy and the missions of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates unless an unspecified number of prisoners were freed from Yemeni jails.</p> <p>The US and Britain have helped to train Yemeni security forces.</p> <p>The Saudis, who have all but crushed their own al-Qaida groups, are especially nervous about a route for arms, men and money across the long desert border with their neighbour, and a possible link with lawless Somalia just across the Red Sea.</p> <p>It is unclear whether Yemeni jihadis are in direct contact with al-Qaida \"central\" on the Pakistan/Afghanistan border but they have identifiable leaders and have recently been producing internet propaganda and focusing on hitting oil infrastructure and foreign interests in the country.</p> <p>President Ali Abdullah Salih, in power since 1978, has been an ally of the US in its \"war on terror\" since the bombing attack on the USS Cole in Aden harbour in 2000, in which 17 US sailors died. But his government has been accused of taking a lax approach to extremists, especially after 23 prisoners tunnelled their way out of a Sana'a prison in 2006 amid reports of collusion between officials and militants.</p> <p>Western diplomats say Salih had quiet \"understandings\" with al-Qaida that it would be left alone to recruit fighters for the Iraq war if it did not attack inside Yemen. He has also pursued a programme under which jihadis are allowed to go free if they promise to mend their ways.</p> <p>\"This attack is a reminder that we are at war with extremists who will murder innocent people to achieve their ideological objectives,\" George Bush said. </p> <p>The US was angered when a Yemeni-American, Jaber Elbaneh, convicted in Yemen of planning attacks, was freed as he appealed against a 10-year prison sentence. Elbaneh was taken back into custody but Sana'a rejected US requests that he be handed over to the US for trial. American officials were also alarmed when Yemeni courts commuted a death sentence for Jamal al-Badawi, convicted of masterminding the USS Cole attack, giving him instead 15 years in prison.</p>",
  "<p>Department of Health researchers have revealed the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/sep/17/drugsandalcohol.health\">nine types of heavy drinker</a>. Presumably they want us to stop drinking heavily, but when I see anything divided into types, I think of it more like a quiz. Confused about whether your self-harming behaviour is motivated by boredom, depression or a desire to conform? Let me walk you through it. I, by the way, have identified myself as a macho drinker. \"Mostly men, of all ages, they do it to stand out from the crowd.\" You think I'm being facetious, but it does say \"mostly\" men, and I do drink to excess mainly to show off. So it gets me down to a tee. Tea? Ha! With whisky in it, mate. Etc, etc. </p> <p>\"De-stress drinkers\" do it to regain control of life. \"Conformist drinkers\" seek structure and belonging, which sounds a bit like regaining control, but they are specifically manual and clerical workers, aged 45-59. \"Boredom drinkers\" drink to relieve the monotony of life. You can't really argue with that, can you? Like \"depressed drinkers\", your classic bored person can occupy any job or demographic.</p> <p>\"Re-bonding drinkers\" is the one that makes me want to take away the DoH's research budget and spend it, nat\u00fcrlich, on booze. Re-bonders are driven by a need to keep in touch with people who are close to them. It doesn't even make any sense. What's wrong with just talking to them? Are they wearing earplugs, these close people? \"Community drinkers\" are lower-middle-class men and women, who like to feel part of a group; not dissimilar to conformist drinkers, so far as I can make out, except a bit younger. There's clearly a rite-of-passage at age 44, where you stop wanting to belong and start wanting to conform. I wonder if we should be marking this event with, perhaps, a binge of drinking?</p> <p>\"Hedonistic drinkers crave stimulation and want to abandon control.\" Like a macho drinker, except that according to the research they are probably divorced. Last but not least is the \"border dependent\", the person who drinks fast and often, daytime and evening.</p> <p>I can't help thinking ... apart from Methodists and children, doesn't this list describe just about the whole country?</p>",

  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-337738748\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>Barack Obama and John McCain spent millions of dollars yesterday in an unprecedented advertising spree selling their economic messages, as the first opinion polls since the Wall Street meltdown showed a shift towards the Democratic candidate.</p> <p>With the two battling to establish a decisive poll lead, Obama paid for an expensive two-minute slot on national cable television, targeting the 12 so-called battlefield states. Until now television ads have generally been 30-second bursts.</p> <p>The new batch of polls appeared to bear out optimism in the Obama camp that he, rather than McCain, stands to benefit from the impact on voters of the financial collapses. Polls taken since the crisis erupted on Monday suggests the momentum built up behind McCain over the last few weeks has been halted. The latest polls leave the two in a dead heat.</p> <p>A CNN/Time poll released last night showed Obama closing the gap in battlefield states such as Ohio and Florida, which both voted Republican last time. Obama is now tied with McCain on 48% each in Florida and enjoys a 2% lead in Ohio. In North Carolina, normally a safe Republican state, McCain's lead has been reduced to 1%.</p> <p>A New York Times/CBS poll published today found six out of 10 of those surveyed expressed confidence in Obama to run the economy, compared with five out of 10 for McCain. More significantly for Obama's hopes, one in three said their family is worse off than it was four years ago.</p> <p>Obama's ad called for an end to \"the anything-goes culture on Wall Street, with real regulation that protects your investments and pensions\".</p> <p>McCain also put out a campaign ad, aimed at trying to undo damage caused by his remark on Monday that the US economy was fundamentally strong. He sought to distance himself from George Bush's administration and blame corporate greed, as well as to reassure voters.</p> <p>\"Enough is enough,\" he said in the ad. \"I'll meet this financial crisis head on. Reform Wall Street ... Your savings, your jobs I'll keep them safe.\"</p> <p>Neither Obama nor McCain has a background in economics. Obama has yet to establish a convincing message about how to tackle the economy, and his trademark inspirational rhetoric deserts him when he turns to economic matters.</p> <p>McCain admitted this year that he knows little about economics, having specialised in foreign affairs most his life.</p> <p>Neil Newhouse, a Republican pollster, said yesterday that the meltdown should help Obama. But, he added, the poll advantage would go to \"the first of the two who finds his voice\".</p> <p>Some campaign ads are never aired, put together only as a cheap way to gain media attention. It is a sign of how important the two teams judge the current crisis that they are prepared to spend big. Normally, a candidate would only buy a two-minute slot at the closing stage of a campaign.</p> <p>The spending yesterday will push up their advertising bills, at present running at roughly $15m each a week. Much of the advertising from both teams is in the traditional battlefield states of Pennsylvania, Ohio and Florida.</p> <p>The economic crisis has drowned out almost all the trivia and negative personal attacks which had characterised the campaign over the last few weeks.</p> <p>McCain yesterday ridiculed Obama for holding a Hollywood celebrity fundraiser with Barbra Streisand on Tuesday night _ which raised $9m, saying the Democratic candidate was not exactly siding with the people.</p> <p>But the jibe about Obama and celebrities, a regular McCain theme, attracted little media attention. Nor did the decision of a former Hillary Clinton supporter, Lady Lynn Forester de Rothschild, who is married to the British banker and who raised $100,000 for Clinton, to announce she would not be voting for Obama, saying he was \"too far to the left\".</p>",
  "<p>The west's efforts to use the United Nations to promote its values and shape the global agenda are failing, according to a detailed study published yesterday.</p> <p>A sea change in the balance of power in favour of China, India, Russia and other emerging states is wrecking European and US efforts to entrench human rights, liberties and multilateralism. Western policies in crisis regions as diverse as Georgia, Zimbabwe, Burma or the Balkans are suffering serial defeats in what the study identifies as a protracted trend.</p> <p>The haemorrhaging of western power, as reflected in longer-term voting patterns in key UN bodies, is mirrored by the increasing clout of China, Russia and the Islamic world, according to an audit of European influence at the UN by the European Council on Foreign Relations.</p> <p>\"The EU is suffering a slow-motion crisis at the UN,\" says the report, noting that the west is now being regularly outwitted in global diplomatic poker by the Chinese and Russians. \"The problem is fading power to set the rules. The UN is increasingly being shaped by China, Russia and their allies ... The west is in disarray. The EU's rifts with the US on many human rights issues at the UN in the Bush era have weakened both.\"</p> <p>US and European failure to win the day at the UN security council in recent votes on Zimbabwe and Burma as well as defeats last year on Kosovo or Darfur and the constant struggle to muster support for global action against Iran because of its nuclear ambitions are traced as part of a broader decline over the past decade.</p> <p>Using a programme designed to analyse voting patterns and statistics, the thinktank found that European policies on human rights enjoyed the support of 72% of UN members a decade ago but only 48% by last year, while the US suffered a steeper collapse from 77% to 30%.</p> <p>\"The pattern of votes in the general assembly shows that opposition to the EU is growing, spurred by a common resistance to European efforts at promoting human rights,\" said the study.</p> <p>The beneficiaries of this disaffection with the west have been China and Russia, which defend national sovereignty and non-intervention in sovereign countries no matter how grievous the atrocities and human rights violations blamed on national governments. Over the past decade support for Chinese and Russian stances on human rights issues has soared from less than 50% to 74% in the UN general assembly.</p> <p>The assembly kicked off this week in New York with the west bracing itself for another debacle. Serbia is to use the session to demand a vote on the \"illegality\" of the secession last February of Kosovo, whose breakaway was strongly backed by the US and most of the EU, and to refer the dispute to the UN's international court of justice. Despite strenuous lobbying by the Europeans to prevent the vote, they have conceded defeat. Only 46 of the 192 UN states have recognised Kosovo's independence. And western attempts to rally support for Georgia in the Caucasus crisis will be rebuffed by the Russians.</p> <p>\"The EU has collectively failed to adapt to new power trends,\" said Martti Ahtisaari, the former Finnish president and a chairman of the thinktank.</p> <p>The setbacks for the west at the UN in New York are compounded by a worse record in winning the battles for rights and freedoms at the Geneva-based UN Human Rights Council. In March the Islamic bloc changed the mandate for the council's rapporteur on freedom of expression, charging him, in the wake of the Danish cartoons crisis, with the obligation to record blasphemy. Critics said the post was supposed to function as an agent of liberty, but became an instrument of repression. </p> <p>\"The head of steam building up in the Islamic world for worldwide defamation legislation is huge,\" said Keith Porteous-Wood, director of Britain's National Secular Society. \"The Human Rights Council can no longer serve a useful purpose.\"</p> <p>In the council's two-year existence, the 19 European countries on the 47-strong body have been marginalised, mired in despair and a sense of futility after losing more than half the votes conducted.</p> <p>The poor European record on winning the world's hearts and minds contrasts with Brussels' habit of talking up the merits of its \"soft power\" attractiveness, and indicates that the EU's huge financial investment in being the world's biggest aid donor and the UN's biggest funder is not translating into political gains.</p>",
  "<p>Barclays has turned its attention to the London operations of Lehman Brothers after agreeing a $1.75bn (\u00a3980m) deal to buy the stricken investment bank's North American operations.</p> <p>John Varley, Barclays chief executive, said the bank had \"opportunities but no obligation\" to buy parts of Lehman outside the US.</p> <p>Teams from Barclays are assessing which parts of the UK business it might want to absorb. \"We are now looking quickly and seriously to see what might fit with the businesses we have around the world,\" Varley said. The potential lifeline will have brought some cheer to the 5,000 Lehman workers in Britain.</p> <p>Bob Diamond, Barclays president, said the focus of interest in Britain would be the equity and capital markets business. \"We wouldn't want to miss the opportunity to add some talent from the UK and Europe.\"</p> <p>There was further good news for Lehman's workers in London when administrator PricewaterhouseCoopers confirmed that they would get paid this month, provided they turn up for work.</p> <p>Barclays issued a statement in the early hours of yesterday confirming it would buy Lehman's North American investment banking and capital markets business. Barclays said the deal secured about half the revenue stream of the old Lehman Brothers. Diamond described the deal as a \"once in a lifetime opportunity for Barclays\". About 10,000 jobs on Wall Street will be saved.</p> <p>Varley said Barclays had been considering a deal with Lehman for some months, as it became apparent the US bank was heading for trouble.</p> <p>The agreement makes Barclays one of the leading banks on Wall Street, with capabilities across equity and debt markets, mergers and acquisitions, commodities trading and foreign exchange. The businesses will be merged into Barclays Capital, though it is not clear whether the Lehman name, one of the oldest on Wall Street, will disappear entirely. The deal still needs to be approved by the bankruptcy court.</p> <p>Barclays is paying $250m cash and taking on $72bn in trading assets and $68bn in trading liabilities. They include mortgage assets, equities, corporate debt, government bonds and commercial paper.</p> <p>It said less than 5% were mortgages that had already been marked down and were further reduced during due diligence. Barclays said the assets and liabilities being acquired had been through \"quite a cleansing process\", adding it had been given the chance to pick and choose assets and had been doing due diligence since the weekend.</p> <p>In addition, Barclays is paying $1.5bn for the Lehman Brothers headquarters in midtown Manhattan and two data centres in New Jersey.</p> <p>Barclays said the deal would enhance its capital ratio, rather than prove detrimental, and be earnings accretive. \"We have tried to be very disciplined in the way we have managed our balance sheet and you should assume those disciplines will remain in place,\" Varley said.</p> <p>He underlined how important it had been to get the deal done quickly to prevent an exodus of staff and clients. Workers have been clearing their desks since it became apparent on Sunday evening that the firm was finished.</p> <p>A deadline for completing the deal to buy the North American business has been set for September 24.</p> <p>The agreement is being supported by certain \"strategic\" investors in the bank, who have agreed to subscribe to at least $1bn of new equity. Barclays did not name which investors would be supporting the deal, but Qatar Investment Authority, China Development Bank and Singapore's Temasek are among its large shareholders.</p> <p>Lehman renewed contact with Barclays on Monday afternoon to see if it would still be interested in buying some of its assets. Diamond, who led the failed weekend negotiations to take control of Lehman, had remained in the US and worked through the night to hammer out an agreement.</p>",
  "<p>Britain is engaged in a \"generational struggle\" to defeat the Taliban-led insurgency in Afghanistan, Des Browne, the defence secretary, warned yesterday.</p> <p>Speaking to the Guardian before a meeting of Nato defence ministers in London today, he called for an \"honest discussion\" about the problems facing the alliance, notably its inability to deploy adequate forces and failure to invest in needed equipment, and the need to \"transform\" Nato. It was the most successful military alliance the world had ever seen, he said. But it was set up to fight the cold war-type conflicts rather than the expeditionary type operations currently being fought in Afghanistan, and that was something the 26 defence ministers needed to address.</p> <p>Just 10% of the infrastructure of Nato headquarters in Brussels was devoted to actual military operations, Browne said. And most European countries possessed \"static non-deployable forces\".</p> <p>British commanders in Afghanistan have for years asked for more helicopters to move soldiers around relatively safely, and aircraft to supply them with equipment more quickly. Browne said there were many hundreds of helicopters in Europe, but they were not deployable. They didn't have adequate protection and their crews were not trained to special forces levels. He was discussing with other European countries, in particular France, ways to share helicopter resources.</p> <p>Officials and military commanders in Afghanistan say the Taliban and other insurgent groups are in control of more and more territory and that at best the battle against them has reached stalemate. Browne said: \"In Helmand province the Afghan government has a significant presence and a degree of control in every single part of where the people live in any concentration. What people who talk about stalemate mean is that we control that area now ... we have to concentrate on holding and maintaining what we have achieved. We will never be able to expand beyond that unless we can, as it were, backfill with a combination of the Afghan army and their own governance and economic development.\" </p> <p>It was a challenge he made no bones about, he said. To reach a state when the Afghans had \"ownership of their own security\" was going to take time. How long? \"It will be a generational struggle,\" he said. Two generations of Afghans had been denied access to education and law. </p> <p>Browne suggested that Nato should cooperate more effectively in future with organisations including the EU, which he described as having \"complementary capabilities\", the UN, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. </p> <p>He will raise concern growing among British military commanders and in Whitehall about US military tactics in Afghanistan with Robert Gates, the US defence secretary, who is attending the London meeting called by Browne. An increasing number of Afghan civilians are being killed in US bombing raids.</p> <p>According to defence sources, more British special forces are being deployed to Afghanistan in operations against Taliban in the south. Asked about US cross-border operations in Pakistan, Browne said: \"We have no intention of going into Pakistan.\" The insurgency in Afghanistan was a \"shared problem\" with Pakistan.</p> <p>There was no prospect of Nato military intervention in Georgia, he said.</p>",
  "<p>It was only a decade ago that Tzipi Livni decided to become a politician. She had served as a young agent in Israel's foreign secret service, the Mossad, and then gave up an agency career to become a commercial lawyer until one autumn holiday, not long after the signing of the Oslo peace accords with the Palestinians, she decided to step into politics. Now she is just weeks away from becoming Israel's next prime minister after winning a striking victory in her Kadima party's leadership election yesterday.</p> <p>Livni, who is 50 and married with two sons, has been long tipped as a future leader and in recent months emerged as more dovish than many in her party. On the Palestinian front she advocates a two-state, negotiated settlement, though she adamantly resists any prospect of a return for Palestinian refugees into what is now Israel. On Iran and its nuclear ambitions she favours a tightening of sanctions, but seems less eager than other leading politicians for an outright military confrontation.</p> <p>Yet her background is more firmly embedded in Israel's right-wing. She was born into a \"fighting family\" and one that is much respected in Israel. Her father, Eitan Livni, was a senior figure in the Irgun, the underground militant Zionist movement that fought the British before the creation of the state. When she turned to politics, she turned naturally to the Likud, the leading rightist party.</p> <p>But three years ago she followed the then prime minister and Likud leader, Ariel Sharon, when he left the party, created his own movement, Kadima, or Forward. He argued that the dream of a Greater Israel from the Mediterranean to the River Jordan was unachievable and that the land should be shared with a Palestinian state. The creation of that Palestinian state is still a distant prospect, but many argue Livni is committed to a two-state solution to the seemingly intractable Middle East conflict.</p> <p>Avraham Diskin, a political scientist at Hebrew University in Jerusalem, said Livni was more dovish than her challengers for the party leadership. \"Ideologically everybody is now in the centre, people realise the risk and want to have peace and pay the price but the difference is in the nuances,\" he said. \"But she is emotionally involved, not just ideologically, she is very interested and she is a believer.\"</p> <p>Livni has been Israel's lead negotiator in the current talks with the Palestinians which began in Annapolis, in the United States, in November last year. With Livni as prime minister those talks could be expected to continue, perhaps even with a successful result. \"With her there is a chance of a conclusion, of having a piece of paper. What happens after that is difficult. But she is very highly motivated,\" Diskin said.</p> <p>However, the prospect of a peace agreement will depend just as heavily on the outcome of the US presidential elections. Even following a year of talks there are precious few signs of progress on the ground on the core issues and much evidence that the situation is slowly worsening.</p> <p>Livni herself made it clear just last month that she would not be rushed into a deal. \"I think that any attempt to bridge gaps that maybe it's premature to bridge, or to reach something that is not the comprehensive agreement that we want to reach can lead to doing it wrong just because of the pressure,\" she said.</p> <p>But before there can be negotiations, Livni must first form a coalition government. She will meet with Shimon Peres, the Israeli president, this week and he will give her 42 days to bring onside enough allied parties to form a majority in the Knesset, or parliament. Kadima has 29 seats in the 120-seat Knesset and will need Labour's 19 seats as well as other smaller parties, whose support will be more difficult to secure. There is likely to be a long period of back-room negotiating that will test Livni's skill before a deal is done and which may demand compromises that later limit her ability to strike a deal with the Palestinians.</p> <p>She will also be operating in an intensely male environment, where military experience is often as highly regarded as political acumen. She has already had to fight off suggestions she might be too weak for the job. \"The fact that I'm a woman doesn't make me a weak leader,\" she told the Jerusalem Post last week. \"It's not that generals pull the trigger and women don't. I have no problem pulling the trigger when necessary.\"</p> <p>One of her greatest challenges will be to restore some integrity to the tainted Israeli political system. She has a rare, corruption-free, \"Mrs Clean\" reputation, but will have an uphill battle to restore the public's faith in her colleagues. After all, her rise to the most powerful job in Israel only comes because of the fall of the current prime minister, Ehud Olmert, who has faced five separate corruption investigations in the past two years.</p>",
  "<p>The 73-year-old US investment bank Morgan Stanley became the latest financial titan to cast around for an alliance last night as fading confidence in Wall Street firms sucked its shares down by 24%.</p> <p>Reports in the US suggested that Morgan Stanley had received an approach from the North Carolina-based high street banking group Wachovia about combining forces through a merger.</p> <p>Such a tie-up would give Morgan Stanley access to retail deposits as an extra source of capital, a logic similar to Merrill Lynch's takeover by Bank of America earlier in the week.</p> <p>Venting his frustration, Morgan Stanley's chief executive, John Mack, sent out an internal memo accusing speculators of deliberately driving down his bank's stock. He said he was liaising with the US treasury and the securities and exchange commission. \"What is happening out there?\" Mack asked in the company-wide email. \"It's very clear to me - we're in the midst of a market controlled by fear and rumours, and short sellers driving our stock down.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, the savings and loans bank Washington Mutual, which has been struggling for weeks, called in Goldman Sachs to conduct an auction of its business. The firm, is struggling under the weight of underperforming mortgages. Its biggest investor, Texas Pacific Group, has given the green light for a sale.</p> <p>The US government had hoped that its emergency rescue of the insurance group AIG would calm nerves on the financial markets. The Federal Reserve effectively nationalised AIG late on Monday by giving it an $85bn loan for a 79.9% stake.</p> <p>As staff arrived for work at AIG, the company said it would be business as usual, albeit under government control</p> <p>Eric Dinallo, New York state's insurance superintendent,...#65279; who helped broker the bailout, accused banks and insurance companies of poor management in diversifying too broadly. \"It is clear to me that financial services and insurance has gotten away from its core competence and that is dangerous,\" said Dinallo. He compared companies' strategies to driving a car while putting on make-up, looking at a BlackBerry and having a conversation. \"That is not the way to drive a car safely,\" he said.</p> <p>Experts said the money should keep AIG above water. Bijan Moazami, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets, said: \"The size of the loan was designed to leave little doubt that AIG would be able to survive the current market turmoil regardless of what the next several quarters hold.\"</p> <p>AIG's operations in the UK, which have \u00a3900m of regulated capital, are among the businesses that could be sold in an effort to raise money. Some 80% of AIG's revenue in Britain comes from providing liability insurance to employers, while the rest is in \"own label\" policies for retailers. </p>",
  "<p>Russell Simmons is in reflective mood. The 50-year-old music mogul, fashion entrepreneur, community activist, jeweller and philanthropist is frequently portrayed as somewhat self-absorbed. Perhaps it's the fast-approaching appointment with his London yoga teacher, or maybe he is just tired at the end of a day of radio appearances and networking that followed an overnight flight from his native New York this morning; but as he sits in a loose-fitting, upmarket T-shirt, his trademark baseball cap in place, sipping black tea in a Knightsbridge hotel, the hustler and huckster credited with turning hip-hop from a New York street-music scene to a multi-billion-dollar global industry is oozing humility.</p> <p>\"I don't spend any time thinking about my place in history, ever,\" he says. \"If people say I changed things, it's nice, and I take it - but if I could give it to a charity it would be useful. I really believe now that my only job in life is to achieve a state of comfort and happiness. I'm still fearful, I'm still separated, I'm still disconnected from myself, you know? But I believe if you go to work on it every day, baby steps mean something.\"</p> <p>Simmons is in London to introduce his Def Comedy Jam to the UK via a short series of gigs. He dutifully plugs the tour, which features five up-and-coming black comedians, and the brand, which, in its live and TV incarnations in the US, helped launch the careers of stars including Chris Rock, Bernie Mac and Chris Tucker. But, as befits the businessman whose restless energy earned him the teenage nickname \"Rush\", he is unable to stick to one topic for long. Amid freeform discourses on several current projects - trying to run an ethical diamond business; working to improve relations between America's blacks, Jews and Muslims; providing a range of financial products to empower the poor; launching a clothing brand inspired by what Barack Obama would wear \"if it was up to him\" - he offers the occasional insight into what makes him tick.</p> <p>\"It's just part of an ongoing, you know, service,\" he offers. \"You give what you've got, and I have access. So it's like kinda you have to do it - you have it, so that's why you do it.\"</p> <p>A small-time weed dealer in the New York borough of Queens, Simmons' life was changed when he encountered hip-hop at a club in 1977. Savvy enough to realise that his talents lay not in performance but promotion, he became a manager. His first client, Kurtis Blow, was the first rapper to sign with a major record label, and he oversaw the career of his brother Joe's group, Run DMC, whose 1986 collaboration with Aerosmith, Walk This Way, was instrumental in turning rap into a hugely profitable genre worldwide.</p> <p>With the rock-fan-turned-rap-producer Rick Rubin, Simmons founded Def Jam. Hip-hop's best-known imprint, it provided a home for artists such as Public Enemy, LL Cool J and the Beastie Boys, and, fuelled by Simmons' inspired mix of showmanship and entrepreneurial flair, played a critical role in broadening the music's audience beyond its predominantly black New York roots. Before anyone else, Simmons saw how pervasive this street culture could become, and over the past three decades he has constantly managed to position himself at the points where hip-hop meets the mainstream - whether in music, fashion, business or politics.</p> <p>\"I've always been a bridge,\" he says in the middle of a lengthy explanation-cum-defence of his controversial involvement with the diamond giant De Beers, but the observation seems to apply just as aptly to every other area of his life and work. \"I spoke at a jewellery convention,\" he recalls of a recent event in the US, \"and there were no African Americans at all - not one - among these 2,000 people. But that's the jewellery business: tight-ass, the way the fashion business was when I got in it. When I started in fashion, there was nobody [of a similar background] in it, and now if you go to the department [stores] where I'm sold, you will see 15 other [black-owned or designed] brands. Before Run DMC, on MTV there were no black people at all, except Michael Jackson. And he had his nose broke and his hair straightened, so he didn't really express the kinds of things the rappers got to talk about.\"</p> <p>In the mid-90s, with hip-hop a global youth culture, Simmons diversified, launching the streetwear range Phat Farm and inaugurating the Def Comedy Jam - brands with strong connections to the hip-hop style and attitude he had been the first to commodify. Never one to undersell himself - he had appeared on a track on LL Cool J's 1985 debut album, sending himself up as a caricature of a money-hungry svengali - Simmons was a bigger name than many of the artists he worked with. In 1998 he married his long-time girlfriend, the model Kimora Lee, and began to count the likes of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton as friends.</p> <p>He sold his remaining shares in Def Jam in 2003, continuing as chairman for some time, but has now ceased all involvement in the label. He does not believe that the music business, in its current period of directionless turmoil, is one he would choose to get into were he 20 years old today. \"But that's using my brain,\" he cautions. </p> <p>\"I don't use my brain about the creative thing. From a business standpoint, I instinctively do things: when I get something right, it's never because I use my brain. People are afraid of failure - they don't like to work so hard and have people keep saying, 'No.' I think that's what people fear most. I'm not that afraid, obviously, 'cos I stay on something and keep pushing until there's absolutely no hope.\"</p> <p>Indeed, for all the successes, Simmons has chalked up a number of missteps. His relationships with artists have sometimes been fractious: the Beastie Boys left Def Jam following their spectacularly successful debut LP over money arguments with Simmons, who was both label owner and manager. After severing ties with Def Jam in 1999, Public Enemy's Chuck D took to calling his former label boss \"Hustler Scrimmons\" in blog postings. And in 2007 Simmons was strongly criticised for pronouncing the diamond trade clean after visiting Botswanan diamond mines as a guest of De Beers, which supplies stones for Simmons' jewellery line.</p> <p>He remains affably unconcerned, claiming to have \"repaired [his] friendship\" with the Beasties while admitting that he was not \"talented or sensitive enough to manage [his] way through\" the band's stay on Def Jam. He states that Public Enemy remain his all-time favourite artists and argues that his investment in a South African meditation school, and the pressure he can bring to bear through his personal relationship with De Beers chairman Nicky Oppenheimer, means that his involvement in the diamond business is a force for positive change.</p> <p>In his personal life, too, there have been highs and lows. His marriage ended in divorce and recent tabloid reports have confirmed the end of his relationship with another model, Porschia Coleman.</p> <p>\"I don't know where my Tony is,\" he chuckles, referring to the Broadway award he won in 2003 for the Def Poetry Jam. \"I think my ex-wife got it. She got a lot of shit!\" Including custody of the pair's two children, Ming, eight, and Aoki, six, towards whose upkeep Simmons has to pay a reported $40,000 a month. \"I'd rather she had full custody of the kids because she's great with 'em,\" he says. \"But, shit, I have a pretty easy life - and those details [that appear in the press], the worst of 'em are not so bad, I don't think. I'm not a priest, or a yogi - I don't have any kind of issues with the way I'm living.</p> <p>\"That's the thing about practising yoga,\" he concludes. \"You smile at every pose, no matter how difficult, and that's the practice in life. You practise polishing up the pose, and sometimes you smile even though it hurts, right? You keep smiling, the bones get aligned, and eventually you like the pose\".</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Russell Simmons Presents Def Comedy Jam at London Brixton Academy on Saturday</p>",
  "<p>Lawyers and Republican aides acting on behalf of Sarah Palin are engaged in a fierce legal battle to block an inquiry into the so-called troopergate affair, in which the vice-presidential candidate is accused of abusing her public office to wage a vendetta against her former brother-in-law.</p> <p>The bipartisan panel of the Alaskan state legislature in charge of the inquiry is under pressure to drop the proceedings, or put them off until after the November 4 presidential elections. </p> <p>In the latest move, five Republican members of the state assembly have issued a lawsuit seeking to halt the investigation on the grounds that it is \"McCarthyistic, partial and partisan\".</p> <p>On Tuesday, the Republican attorney general of Alaska ruled that 13 witness subpoenas to appear before the inquiry would not have to be honoured.</p> <p>The Democratic head of the panel, Hollis French, has vowed to press on with the inquiry, which is due to report on October 10. \"Sarah Palin's nomination as vice-presidential candidate really doesn't change the steps we are going through to complete the investigation, it just raises its visibility significantly,\" he said.</p> <p>The campaign of disruption is an indication of how seriously troopergate is being taken within Republican ranks. Allegations that Palin misused her position as governor of Alaska for personal reasons are potentially damaging to John McCain's presidential hopes as he has billed his running mate as an ethical choice who will combat corruption and cronyism in Washington.</p> <p>At the heart of the affair is the accusation that Palin sacked the head of the Alaskan police service, Walter Monegan, because he refused to take a tough stance against her former brother-in-law, Mike Wooten, who works as a trooper - a state police officer. Wooten and Palin's sister Molly were involved in an acrimonious divorce. It has emerged that Palin, her husband, Todd, and several close aides complained about Wooten to Monegan on at least a dozen occasions, urging him to dismiss the trooper or have him moved. Monegan resisted their advances, until he was himself fired.</p> <p>In an interview with the Wall Street Journal yesterday Monegan said: \"The first thing I said when I was told I was fired was, 'Is it because of Wooten?'\"</p> <p>The union representing Wooten, the Public Safety Employees Association, says the trooper was investigated several years ago over alleged improprieties raised by Palin and others that included the shooting of a moose without a proper licence. Wooten was found in breach on some charges and suspended for five days, at which point the case was closed.</p> <p>Soon after Palin became governor in November 2006 the accusations were raised again. In one email to Monegan she wrote: \"Amazing. [Wooten]'s still a trooper, and he still carries a gun, and he still tells anyone who will listen that he will 'never work for that bitch, Palin' because he has such anger and distain [sic] towards my family.\"</p> <p>John Cyr, the union's director, said: \"She has used the bully pulpit of the governor's office to demonise a man who was trying to do his job and raise his family.\"</p> <p>In her defence, Palin says she sacked the police chief not because he refused to act against her former relative, but because he had shown insubordination towards her over the management of the police budget.</p>",
  "<p><strong>I am a 25-year-old man in a relationship with a 35-year-old man. We have been going out for three years and live together happily. There is one issue on which we disagree though: he has been using recreational drugs (mainly ecstasy) for a decade or so and I don't like this. I have had terrible experiences with a sibling who takes drugs, and who caused my parents a huge amount of pain as a result.</strong></p> <p><strong>My boyfriend maintains he was \"slowing down\" his drug intake before we met and that he only indulges occasionally. I feel uneasy around drugs and whenever he has taken them, I have worried. We have had lots of long conversations about this, where we \"agree to disagree\", but nothing else. </strong></p> <p><strong>He only takes drugs when he is with a certain group of friends, who are aware of our disagreement. Taking drugs is not a big deal for them. I feel undermined. They are the only people who know about this problem and none of them would ever take my side. His friends have told my boyfriend that we don't look right together and have referred to me as \"the one who sits in the corner while everybody is having a good time\". </strong></p> <p><strong>Last year, he agreed to give up drugs, but he has resented this decision ever since and took one more pill recently. He feels stifled and thinks that I am blowing this all out of proportion because he is not an addict, which is true. I genuinely feel bad for not being able to cope with it better, but I also think I am right to have these views about drugs.</strong></p> <p><strong>If he loves you, he will stop</strong></p> <p>When I met my now husband, he was a recreational drug user, taking mainly pills and some coke. I have always hated drugs, having seen the terrible effect they had on some of my friends, so I asked him to stop. I explained how I felt and said that I would rather not go out with the group of friends with whom he usually took drugs, but that he was free to go ahead and see them on his own. He made the decision that he wouldn't take drugs any more, because it was important to me.</p> <p>I believe that if your boyfriend loves you, he will not continue to take drugs against your wishes. If it is a rare occurrence at the moment, then he should not find it too much of a hardship to stop it entirely. Perhaps the source of tension between you is less about drugs and more about him feeling you are trying to control him. I would advise you to avoid socialising with those \"friends\" of his who disapprove of your principled stance. <br><strong>CI, London</strong></p> <p><strong>End the relationship</strong></p> <p>Respect yourself more. You say you \"agree to disagree\", but this is obviously not true, as you are seeking advice on the issue. At 35, your partner is unlikely to stop his recreational drug use; he is also allowing you and your relationship with him to be undermined by his drug-taking friends. You appear to be more committed to the relationship than he is, as he obviously does not take your concern about his drug-taking seriously, even though you have first-hand family experience of drugs. </p> <p>I watched the relationship of two close friends disintegrate because of a similar situation, so would advise you to end this relationship before things reach breaking point. You are only 25 and could find a fuller, more rewarding relationship. Learn to let go. <br><strong>BP, London</strong></p> <p><strong>An ultimatum is not the answer</strong></p> <p>You can only change yourself. Your boyfriend probably can't see any reason to change his ways: he believes that taking drugs has done him no harm and he enjoys the experience. His only motivation to change is to stop you berating him for his habit.</p> <p>You say one of your siblings had a drugs problem, which caused you a lot of pain; are you reminded of this every time your boyfriend uses drugs? If so, you need to explore this more. Why continue to \"sit in the corner\"? If seeing someone take drugs is that distressing, why put yourself in that situation? You can't make your boyfriend stop, but you can avoid being around him when he does take drugs. Don't give him another ultimatum - take action yourself.<br><strong>HC, via email</strong></p> <p><strong>Try to be objective</strong></p> <p>It is hard to deal objectively with emotions that overwhelm us, such as the understandable fear you experience when people close to you use drugs. The hurtful comments made by your partner's friends are almost bound to trigger some insecurity. However, it is important to try to understand and control our reactions, when these threaten to undermine an otherwise happy relationship. </p> <p>Make an assessment of the extent to which your partner's behaviour poses a risk to his health or your relationship by reference to the available evidence. For instance, consult recent reports about the potential dangers of recreational drug use and consider the experiences of your partner and his friends, alongside what happened to your sibling. This exercise may help to calm your fears. There is a wealth of advice available on dealing with anxiety - exercise, yoga, country walks and distraction are all worth considering. </p> <p>On the other hand, trying to control your partner is both impossible and undesirable. Built-up resentment always seems to find an outlet. As the parent of a teenager and younger children too, I am always trying to balance their increasing need for freedom with my desire for them to eat their food and do their homework. There is no way I would attempt to control my partner though. </p> <p>As for your partner's friends: avoid the ones you don't like when you can, be polite when you can't do this and don't criticise them to your partner. Above all, develop your own interests and friendships.<br><strong>Name and address withheld</strong></p> <h2>What the expert thinks: Linda Blair</h2> <p>Most recreational drugs are illegal and all of them have potentially harmful side-effects, so you are certainly justified in holding the views you do. However, that does not mean you have the right to insist that your boyfriend shares your views. Equally, he has no right to expect you to take drugs yourself, to approve of his behaviour, or even to be with him when he takes drugs.</p> <p>Ecstasy, the substance you say he uses most often, is a Class A drug. That means it is illegal to have it, sell it, or even to give it away. If your boyfriend is caught in possession of ecstasy while you are together, it will be hard for you to prove your innocence. The penalty for possession is up to seven years in prison.</p> <p>I expect you are both aware of the potential side-effects of drugs such as ecstasy, so I won't elaborate on these here. However, it is worth reminding you both that, because the drugs he takes are illegal, he must obtain them illegally. That means he can never be sure that he is buying what he intends to buy, so he is also putting himself at risk of unexpected side-effects from substances that may have been added to what he assumes he is buying.</p> <p>That said, the heart of your disagreement is not whether he is taking drugs that are illegal or dangerous. The more pressing problem is how the two of you can find a comfortable compromise, given your differing attitudes to drug use. The fact that your boyfriend agreed to give up his habit last year and that, by and large, he has kept to his decision shows how much he cares for and respects you. Nonetheless, his attempts have not resulted in an absolute resolution of the disagreement, and you are both still unhappy. You need to look for new ways to break this deadlock.</p> <p>I suggest you start by examining carefully the reasons you give when you tell him that you don't want him to take drugs. The way you have presented the problem suggests that you refer mainly to the terrible experiences you had with your sibling. No doubt these were traumatic, but by constantly referring to your own past, you risk making your boyfriend feel you are being selfish, and he may justifiably conclude that you are not trying to see things from his point of view.</p> <p>Instead, emphasise your concern for your boyfriend's health and safety. Let him know you appreciate his efforts to respect your wishes. Probably the best way to sort things out would be to talk together to a counsellor. If your boyfriend agrees with this, ask your GP to recommend someone locally. Alternatively, contact Relate (<a href=\"http://www.relate.org.uk\">relate.org.uk</a>, 0300 100 1234) or the National Drugs Helpline (0800 776600) to see if they can recommend someone appropriate. That way, you can talk things over with a professional who is experienced, but outside the immediate situation. If your boyfriend is not willing to accompany you, you could still talk to the counsellor yourself to find new ways to approach this problem.</p> <p>You have a good chance of finding a mutually acceptable solution if you will both simply agree to look at things afresh, each from the other's point of view.</p> <h2>Next week: Is divorce the only way to move on?</h2> <p>I am 31 and, 18 months ago, I separated from my husband. I met him when I was only 19 and we have two children, both still under the age of 10. Despite the huge emotional chasm between us, we have always been sexually close - even following our separation. One evening eight months ago, we met by chance and we have been sleeping together since then.</p> <p>I know that this situation is stifling our ability to move on from our marriage. I have been keen to keep our relationship secret from our children, as I do not want to confuse them or give them false hope of a reconciliation. Ironically, one of the main reasons that we separated in the first place was because of my husband's lack of commitment to our children.</p> <p>In recent weeks, I have become attracted to someone at work, and I think he likes me too. While I recognise that this there is no future in a relationship with him because he is married, I still feel guilty all the time for wanting him.</p> <p>I am under increasing pressure from friends and family to date again and have been advised that I should get a divorce in order to disentangle myself from my husband.

  "<p>If this represented the simple part of Group E for Celtic, their supporters must have real concerns about what lies in wait when Manchester United and Villarreal arrive. Aalborg's semi-stubborn resistance was sufficient to rebuff Gordon Strachan's side, the Danish team even surviving the closing 11 minutes with 10 men.</p> <p>The visitors harboured a genuine grievance after Michael Beauchamp was sent-off in a glaring case of mistaken identity. Claiming a point at a venue where more illustrious sides have struggled should placate them for now.</p> <p>Celtic, for whom Barry Robson squandered a first-half penalty, were strangely sluggish. \"Our first half particularly was below the standard we have set ourselves,\" admitted Strachan. \"It becomes more imperative now that we go and win a game away from home.\"</p> <p>Celtic's problems should not overshadow a memorable night for Bruce Rioch, the Aalborg manager, who retains aspirations of returning to Britain when his contract expires in December. \"We were fantastic,\" said the coach once revered at Middlesbrough, adding with a smile: \"I don't know about Celtic, but we were under par tonight as well.\"</p> <p>Aalborg gave anything but the impression they were in awe of the surroundings in the early stages. Michael Jakobsen worried Artur Boruc with a fierce free-kick, then Jeppe Curth failed to control his shot when clean through. Celtic's penalty was fortuitous. Not only had they hardly been seen as an attacking threat before Steve Olfers tripped Shaun Maloney, but Maloney also appeared to handle the ball.</p> <p>Celtic's attacking endeavours in the first five minutes of the second half amounted to more than they had conjured up in the previous 45. Scott Brown even had the ball in the net but was denied by a highly dubious offside flag. Further controversy followed, with Beauchamp wrongly dismissed. Shunsuke Nakamura's subsequent free-kick was clawed away. A match-winning moment of magic would have been out of context in any case. </p>",
  "<p>Children under 18 should be banned from using sunbeds, doctors said today following a major review into the link between sunbeds and skin cancer.</p> <p>They reviewed published research on the health effects of ultraviolet radiation and found clear evidence that using sunbeds or prolonged exposure to sunlight in childhood raises the risk of people developing skin cancer later in life.</p> <p>A ban on under 18s using sunbeds should be accompanied by a clampdown on advertising campaigns that claim they are safe to use, the doctors added. </p> <p>Writing in the journal Pigment Cell and Melanoma Research, doctors at St George's Hospital Medical School in London, Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and the University of New Mexico Cancer Centre conclude: \"UV radiation exposure is one of the most avoidable causes of cancer risk and mortality in man. Whereas genetic and other factors undoubtedly contribute importantly to skin cancer risk, the role of UV is incontrovertible, and efforts to confuse the public, particularly for purposes of economic gain by the indoor tanning industry, should be vigorously combated for the public health.\" </p> <p>The researchers also highlight studies that suggest skin only develops a tan as a direct response to DNA damage caused by ultraviolet radiation, implying there is no such thing as a \"safe\" tan.</p> <p>Dorothy Bennett, professor of cell biology at St George's Hospital Medical School in London, who authored one of three related papers in the journal, says: \"There is very clear evidence that UV radiation is able to cause mutations and also to cause skin cancer. We know that people who have used a sunbed before the age of 35 have a 75% increased risk of skin cancer.\"</p> <p>More than 150,000 children under 16 have used sunbeds in Britain, according to a survey conducted earlier this year by the consumer association Which? That is despite recently updated guidelines from the Health and Safety Executive to ban under 18s from using sunbeds, and a recommendation from the industry body, The Sunbed Association, that its members refuse to accept the custom of anyone under the age of 16.</p> <p>Earlier this year, Scottish MSPs voted to ban under 18s from using sunbeds, a move the Department of Health is considering under its ongoing Cancer Reform Strategy.</p> <p>According to Cancer Research UK, cases of skin cancer in the UK have nearly tripled since the 1980s, with women more likely to develop the disease than men. </p> <p>The charity estimates that around 100,000 cases of non-melanoma skin cancer are diagnosed each year, with a further 8,900 cases of the more dangerous melanoma skin cancer recorded. More than 2,300 people die from skin cancer in the UK each year. </p> <p>Of patients diagnosed with skin cancer in Britain in 2000, 78% of men and 91% of women survived for five years. The lifetime risk of skin cancer for men is 1 in 147, and 1 in 117 for women. </p> <p>A spokeswoman for The Sunbed Association said: \"There's no medical or scientific evidence to support raising the age people can use a sunbed from 16 to 18 years old. If there was any evidence to support that, we would enforce it in our salons.\" Around a quarter of Britain's 6,000 tanning salons are members of the association.</p> <p>A Department of Health spokesperson said: \"The Government strongly discourages the use of sunbeds for cosmetic purposes, especially by minors. The Cancer Reform Strategy reaffirmed our commitment to a review of options for possible regulation of the sunbed industry. Firstly we propose gathering more information about the number and distribution of sunbeds and the scale of sunbed use by young people.\"</p> <p>Caroline Cerny, Cancer Research UK's SunSmart campaign manager, said: \"Overexposure to UV rays, whether from sunbathing or using sunbeds, simply is not good for our skin. This review supports the body of evidence that UV radiation causes long-term skin damage, which could eventually lead to cancer.</p> <p>\"Cancer Research UK's SunSmart campaign provides advice on how to enjoy the sun safely and stresses the importance of making sure you never burn. We are also calling on the government to introduce legislation to regulate the sunbed industry to restrict under 18s from using sunbeds.\"</p> <p>Some exposure to sunlight is needed for the body to synthesise healthy levels of vitamin D, though Prof Bennett said 15 minutes in the sunshine with only the face and arms exposed is enough. People who have very low levels of vitamin D are more likely to develop bowel cancer, heart disease and bone disorders, according to recent research.</p>",

  "<p>A \u00a312bn takeover of Britain's biggest lender, HBOS, failed to halt the deepening crisis in the world's financial markets tonight as a wave of fresh speculation saw two of Wall Street's most prestigious investment banks targeted as the latest victims of the credit crunch.</p> <p>On a day of frenetic activity and unfolding drama, shares in the City fell for a third day and Wall Street stocks suffered a steep decline despite attempts to restore calm through a takeover of HBOS by Lloyds TSB, which was agreed tonight, and the nationalisation of the US insurance giant AIG. </p> <p>The FTSE 100 index dropped more than 2% to close at 4912.4 - its lowest level for more than three years. </p> <p>In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average closed down 449 points at 10,609, taking it 25% below its peak reached in October last year. The price of gold rocketed by 11% in its biggest ever one-day gain as investors searched for safe havens.</p> <p>Gordon Brown intervened to broker a solution to HBOS and Downing Street made clear it was prepared to rip up Britain's competition laws to allow the takeover - a move that may cause the loss of tens of thousands of jobs and the closure of up to 500 branches. After intense negotiations, a deal was clinched shortly after 9.30pm and is set to be announced this morning. </p> <p>In an extraordinary day of trading for HBOS, shares in the bank halved within the first hour of trading and at one stage stood at 88p. The sell-off prompted news of the proposed takeover, part of a contingency plan drawn up by the government to prevent a repeat of the Northern Rock fiasco. HBOS shares leapt above their opening level briefly before enduring another sell-off to close the day down 20%. Other banks were also caught up in the turmoil. Royal Bank of Scotland fell 10%.</p> <p>By the close of business:<br><strong>\u00b7</strong> Shares in Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs had been pummelled. The last two remaining investment banks after the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the takeover of Merrill Lynch were facing questions about their ability to withstand global turmoil. Shares in Goldman Sachs were down 19%. Morgan Stanley suffered a 24% decline, prompting a memo from its chief executive, John Mack, attacking \"irresponsible\" speculators for spreading fear and rumour.<br><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Dow Jones industrial average fell by almost 4%, prompting the Securities and Exchange Commission - the US financial watchdog - to announce a clampdown on short-selling of shares, a process whereby speculators borrow stock in order to sell it and then buy it back at a lower price.<br><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Bank of England announced that it was extending its special liquidity scheme, which is intended to ease pressures on banks, until the end of January. Until this week's turmoil in the markets, Mervyn King, the Bank's governor, had insisted the facility, introduced in the wake of the collapse of Bear Stearns in the spring, would be closed next month. The announcement came as government figures showed a 32,500 rise in the number of people out of work and claiming benefit last month, the biggest rise for 16 years.</p> <p>A terse statement to the stock exchange by HBOS at lunchtime confirmed that it was in talks with Lloyds TSB over a merger. \"In the light of market speculation, the board of HBOS confirms that it is in advanced talks with Lloyds TSB which may or may not lead to an offer being made for HBOS.\" Lloyds TSB made no comment on the proposed deal, but it is understood that its chairman, Sir Victor Blank, and chief executive, Eric Daniels, will be at the helm of the newly merged company. City sources insisted tonight that the relatively small amount cash withdrawals from HBOS - amounting to \u00a31bn of its \u00a3250bn of deposits - showed that the bank was fundamentally sound but had fallen foul of a collective loss of investor confidence in the banking industry.</p> <p>A link-up between the two high street banks would normally fall foul of Britain's tough competition laws, but the Treasury made it clear that John Hutton, the business and enterprise secretary, would use emergency powers to avoid referring the deal to the competition commission. Government sources said that the severity of the financial crisis meant that there was no alternative but to waive normal rules. HBOS, which owns the Halifax, had insisted yesterday that it was not in trouble, but is seen by the markets as particularly vulnerable to the sharp fall in UK house prices. The bank has 22 million customers, accounts for 20% of the mortgage market and takes in one pound in every six saved in the UK.</p> <p>The US authorities were tonight scrutinising the health of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley following a frenetic 10-day period in which they have nationalised the country's two biggest lenders - Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac - refused to bail out Lehman Brothers, helped orchestrate the takeover of Merrill Lynch and provided an $85bn lifeline to AIG.</p> <p>As staff arrived for work at AIG, the world's biggest insurer said it would be business as usual, albeit under government control. New York state's insurance superintendent, Eric Dinallo, who helped to broker the bailout, accused banks and insurance companies of poor management in diversifying far too broadly.</p> <p>\"It is clear to me that financial services and insurance has gotten away from its core competence and that is dangerous,\" said Dinallo, who compared companies' strategies to driving a car while putting on make-up, looking at a BlackBerry and having a conversation: \"That is not the way to drive a car safely.\"</p>",
  "<p>There's no denying it: Sarah Palin has energised the presidential race, and she has had <a href=\"http://blogs.independent.co.uk/the_campaign_trailers/2008/09/snapshot-of-the.html\">no greater impact than in the south</a>. The <a href=\"http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/\">funny poll numbers</a> show it pretty clearly. The Republican base has risen from its sickbed for this wild woman from the far north with an enthusiasm not seen since 2004 when George Bush and Karl Rove made \"swiftboating\" part of the political lexicon. I've watched local Republicans puff up their chest and boast about their candidate for the first time since the race began. Her frontier background, God-fearing, gun-totin' ways and defiant tone (not to mention her conservative feminine allure) have revived \u2013 <a href=\"http://hotlineblog.nationaljournal.com/archives/2008/09/diageohotline_t_6.html\">somewhat</a> \u2013 the GOP political machine.</p> <p>But what the sudden rush of punditry about Palin isn't mentioning much is <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/15/us/politics/15donors.html?em\">the other faction she has energised</a>. While the GOP rejoices, the Democrats look upon Palin with horror, seeing a living representation of everything they are fighting against. And after a few weeks of freaking out they are getting to work with new defiant energy and a grim determination. </p> <p>The progressive wing of the Democratic party loathes Palin and everything she stands for: corporate exploitation of natural resources, knee-jerk patriotic jingoism, an abhorrence for social programmes, the proud ignorance of the frontier-style \"ugly American\" \u2013 not to mention slaughtering woodland creatures for fun. The more moderate wing of Barack Obama enthusiasts see her as a threat to their candidate's historic journey, a cheap and cynical play by a decrepit regime desperate to retain power \u2013 and they're pushing that much harder to get out the vote and register new voters. </p> <p>And then there are the former Pumas. For those who didn't pay close attention to the intricacies of the Democratic convention this year (how I envy you!), <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jun/07/hillaryclinton.barackobama\">Puma</a> \u2013 \"party unity my ass!\" \u2013 was the title adopted by intransigent Hillary Clinton supporters who were bound and determined to spoil Obama's big day. But after the conciliatory tone of the convention and the bombshell announcement of Palin's spot as running-mate, the Pumas around town have largely re-assessed their strategy. McCain's choice of Palin was clearly designed to lure them away from the Democrats. And a few of the more marginal of Hillary's supporters are, indeed, considering the McCain ticket in a new light.</p> <p>But the vast majority of Hillary's partisans <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gbJvGZDG9ZD_SsuZpy-SSApOaW7AD93858M00\">see Palin as a pathetic mockery of everything they cherished about Clinton's historic run</a>. They see it as a bald-faced and cynical attempt to stack the deck against their candidate. In a word, they are pissed off in such a way that makes their ire at Obama's people a faint memory.</p> <p>At the risk of courting charges of sexism, I'll go ahead and claim that women, not men, are more ruthlessly savage in their judgments of other women. I make this claim having worked in three or four female-dominated industries and witnessing the group female dynamic in all of its glory. Women can be vicious when it comes to other women, and the former Pumas have unsheathed their claws on the subject of Palin.</p> <p>\"She's like every self-important PTA mom I've ever met,\" one of my Clinton-supporting pals, a woman in her 50s I used to work for, confesses to me defiantly. \"She's the woman who dominates every organisation she's part of, demands that her vision become the standard, ruthlessly crushes every opponent \u2026 \" she sputters as she reveals her loathing of the candidate. \"And she's expecting to walk into the presidency without earning it,\" she condemned. \"That just ain't gonna happen! We've got the supreme court to consider. I didn't fight for Hillary all this time just to see some other woman, especially this one, get there first.\"</p> <p>Another former Hillary-ite is less diplomatic in her assessment. \"She said she's a hockey mom, which is like a pit bull with lipstick,\" this 40ish single mom concludes. \"I've seen her record. All glam and no glory. She's just not that good. I'm not impressed. Every time she opens her mouth, she seems to put her foot in it. She's a paper pit bull. She didn't get anyone excited who was going to vote for Obama, anyway.\"</p> <p>One is looking forward to what she sees as an inevitable cat-fight between the two. \"I can't wait until Hill unloads on that \u2026 witch,\" she says, choosing her words carefully as her two-year-old runs into the room. \"She'd take her apart in a debate. Obama behaved \u2013 more or less \u2013 like a gentleman. If Hill goes after her, Sarah will look like one of those moose she hunts afterwards. Metaphorically.\"</p> <p>There are, of course, those former Hillary supporters who are so wounded that they are still reluctant to support Obama, despite Palin's explosive arrival on the campaign scene. \"I know it's an important race,\" one woman in her 30s tells me, mournfully. \"But my 'guy' isn't in it any more. She should have been offered the VP spot. She wasn't, so I don't care who wins, now. I'm sure it will be Obama, but it will have to be without my vote. I'll vote third-party, I guess.\"</p> <p>The Obama rank-and-file (many of them political novices) are justifiably wary of the threat Palin poses to their candidate. But they are being <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/5050/story?id=5821280&amp;page=1\">well-directed by the campaign</a>, putting their energy into productive ventures like voter registration, organisation and encouraging the small-donor fundraising that has become Obama's bread-and-butter. They haven't missed the Republicans around town, behaving as if there were a chance at winning for the first time this campaign. They're worried, but not paralysed. But as one of the volunteers confides to me: \"If we take this all the way to election day and we lose, well, Hillary can kiss the presidency goodbye. There won't be enough hope left in the country for her to hope to be elected.\"</p>",
  "<p>A group of Democratic congresswomen today seized on the grim economic news to portray Barack Obama as the presidential candidate best able to improve American women's financial lot.</p> <p>The congresswomen, led by House speaker Nancy Pelosi, this morning attacked John McCain's opposition to expansion of a children's health insurance programme and to legislation seeking equal pay for women, and said his healthcare plan could leave millions of women without insurance.</p> <p>Pelosi said: \"He says he wants private accounts along the lines of the Bush plan. Can you just imagine if President Bush had prevailed, earlier this week when the stock market went down 500 points in one day? That's not social security, that's social insecurity that John McCain supports\". McCain has said he would allow younger workers to divert some of their social security contributions to private accounts invested in stocks.</p> <p>The press conference at the Democratic party headquarters came as McCain has made small but steady gains among women voters, helped by his selection of Alaska governor Sarah Palin as his running mate. Democrats typically hold an advantage among voters on economic issues, and this year polls show voters tend to trust Obama more to handle the economy, although by a slim margin. </p> <p>The Democratic women noted McCain's opposition this spring to a bill that sought equal pay for female workers. McCain skipped the vote in the Senate, saying he opposed the bill because it would have led to more lawsuits.</p> <p>\"To make opportunity real and to knock down this wall that blocks women's progress, we have to send, and elect Barack Obama to the White House,\" said Rosa Delauro, a representative from Connecticut.</p> <p>The group today said that McCain's healthcare plan would leave more women without insurance. His plan involves shifting Americans into individual health insurance programmes rather than ones sponsored by employers. The Centre for American Progress Action Fund, a liberal research organisation, said in a recent study that more than 59m women insured through their employers would be at risk of losing coverage.</p> <p>\"A vote for John McCain is a vote to jeopardise women's access to healthcare,\" said Linda Sanchez, a Democratic congresswoman from California.</p> <p>In response to the Democratic attacks on McCain's legislative record and policy proposals, the McCain campaign noted that Obama's Senate office employs fewer women in top positions than McCain's.</p> <p>\"Barack Obama says he's for equal pay for women, but women working in his Senate office earn an average of $9,000 less than men,\" spokesman Brian Rogers said. </p> <p>\"By contrast, women in John McCain's Senate office actually earn an average of nearly $2,000 more than men. The American people understand that real leadership for the change we need is all about what you do, not just empty words.\"</p>",
  "<p>Condoleezza Rice recently returned empty-handed from <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-israel-rice_greenbergaug26,0,4123326.story\">yet another round of meetings in the Middle East</a>. After nearly eight years of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/27/israelandthepalestinians.usforeignpolicy\">sub-par US leadership</a>, the peace process has stalled, and the Middle East faces a host of regional issues such as a burgeoning food crisis, the destabilising threat of Iraqi refugees pouring into neighbouring countries, nuclear proliferation and the uncertain effects of globalisation.</p> <p>The US secretary of state's unproductive visit serves to underscore the inadequate nature of current US efforts - in a sense, trying to draw blood from a stone in a situation where the prospects for advances on key bilateral fronts like the Israeli-Palestinian peace process are slim. </p> <p>But there is a track of the peace process that has been dormant for the past eight years and that offers the prospect of both advancing the peace process and coordinating a regional approach to the challenges confronting the Middle East: multilateral negotiations.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_Conference\">international conference in Madrid</a> in 1991 established the foundation for the Middle East peace process. The US and the Soviet Union convened the conference as the first step in a process to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict, initiate bilateral negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians and Arab states and begin multilateral negotiations on transnational issues confronting the Middle East.</p> <p>At a subsequent conference in Moscow the following year, the 36 participants organised the multilateral track into <a href=\"http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Peace/multitoc.html\">five working groups</a> to focus on particular regional issues: arms control and regional security, water issues, environment, refugees and economic development. A steering committee organised the negotiations and oversaw the operations of the working groups. Syria and Lebanon boycotted, claiming that bilateral settlements were a prerequisite for multilateral negotiations.</p> <p>Despite holding meetings throughout the 1990s, the multilateral track did not produce many tangible results. There were no large agreements on a coordinated approach to water or environmental issues, and negotiations often bogged down over controversial issues such as Palestinian representation. Despite a lack of successes, however, the multilateral track was not a failure. For one, these talks helped to erase the stigma against negotiation prevalent in the region. Just 20 years ago, the notion of the Arab states engaging in negotiations with Israel would have seemed to be starry-eyed dreaming. </p> <p>Today, restarting the multilateral working groups offers a chance to reinvigorate the stagnant peace process and confront the challenges facing the Middle East. Moreover, the issues the working groups address are more relevant than ever.</p> <p>The Middle East's <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/764142.stm\">water shortages</a> continue, and exacerbate the food shortages plaguing many Arab states. In Israel and Egypt, scientists and farmers are developing new methods of countering desertification and <a href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/12/19/MN34TPJ51.DTL\">growing crops in desert conditions</a>. This research should be available to all countries in the region through the water and environment working groups, and coordinating projects could make the research more efficient. Arab regimes, facing growing popular discontent with rising food prices, have ample incentives to participate in the working groups.</p> <p>There is also cause to restart the arms control and regional security working group. Iran's regional ascendance and the murky goals of its nuclear programme are a shared threat (or at least area of concern) for Israel and the Arab states. Israel clearly perceives Iran as a more pressing threat than do the Arab states, but it is an opportunity to use the arms control and regional security working group to develop a coordinated strategy to confront the threat.</p> <p>The issue of refugees is a particularly sticky subject, as any negotiation quickly turns to the status of Palestinian refugees. But the potentially <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A58648-2005Feb2.html\">destabilising effects of Iraqi refugee populations</a> in Syria, Jordan, the Gulf States and elsewhere demands swift, coordinated action. Tasking the refugee working group with developing a strategy for dealing with Iraqi refugees is one way to convene the group without immediately bogging it down in the Palestinian refugee issue.</p> <p>Globalisation and the latest oil boom are transforming the region and filling the coffers of some Gulf States. But for the states without oil wealth, the economic future is dimmer. Following the dismal assessment of the <a href=\"http://hdr.undp.org/en/reports/regionalreports/arabstates/name,3140,en.html\">2002 Arab Human Development Report</a>, Middle Eastern states have refocused on education reform as the key to adapting to globalisation. Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are each experimenting with new education initiatives. The economic development working group should take up these issues, share information on education reform and discuss the best methods for economic development in the region.</p> <p>If the multilateral negotiations are re-branded as venue for confronting regional challenges, they will both advance the peace process and help to solve regional issues. Transnational threats - presently abundant the Middle East - are powerful incentives for Arab states and Israel to overcome lingering reticence for negotiations and begin cooperating in a way that will build confidence and advance the peace process.</p>",
  "<p>Preoccupied with the Georgia-Russia crisis and the old fears it has resurrected, the world risks missing another important story unfolding in the Caucasus \u2013 that of Azerbaijan. The oil-rich Caspian Sea nation is going to the polls a month from now to vote for its president, but calling the process \"an election\" would be a stretch.<br> The incumbent <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3194422.stm\">Ilham Aliyev</a> \u2013 the authoritarian leader who practically inherited the presidency from his father, Heydar Aliyev, in 2003 \u2013 is expected to win the ballot in a landslide and remain in office for another five years. The opposition \u2013 fragmented, embattled, and disillusioned \u2013 announced it would boycott the vote after parliament passed restrictive amendments to Azerbaijan's election law that eliminated even the appearance of a fair process. The amendments cut the campaign period to 75 days before the vote, eliminated state television free air-time for candidates, and denied the opposition equal representation on election commissions \u2013 a key prerequisite to prevent or at least minimise the possibility of fraud. <br> Several opposition politicians later reconsidered and enlisted to run but the key prospective candidates did not. As a result, on October 15, Aliyev will face six virtual unknowns and win without a doubt. Azerbaijanis' \"choice\" will only be a nominal one. In his five years in office, Aliyev Jr has consolidated his position as a supreme executive \u2013 maintaining authority over the cabinet, legislature, the military, and the judiciary. Externally, his centralised regime has been bolstered by the global demand for oil and the west's need for a partner in anti-terrorism. Azerbaijan has strategic importance for both the United States and Europe \u2013 oil in the Caspian Sea provides an alternative to Russian and Persian Gulf supplies, and the west needs a stable partner along Iran's border. These interests have muted international reaction to Azerbaijani authorities' human rights abuses at home. Domestically, critics have been silenced through imprisonment, violence, and intimidation. In a <a href=\"http://www.cpj.org/elmar/\">new report</a> titled \"Finding Elmar's Killers\", the Committee to Protect Journalists finds that Aliyev's success is built to a large extent on his administration's crackdown on the independent media. Television \u2013 the most influential news medium in the country \u2013 is under the administration's control either directly or through pro-Aliyev owners. Low-circulation print media have more editorial freedom, but their impact on public opinion is small. And with the authorities clamping down on critical journalists, fewer reporters are willing to cover sensitive topics, the most dangerous of which is reporting on the president and his family. Disgruntled officials use criminal defamation charges agaisnt journalists frequently, demanding imprisonment and high damages. Compliant courts usually rubberstamp those demands. The government has resisted persistent calls by international organisations, including the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, to decriminalise libel. <br> When Azerbaijan jailed 10 reporters for their work in 2007, it became Europe and Central Asia's leading jailer of journalists, according to CPJ research. Several were later released through a pardon but the most critical ones remained in jail. Those include <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eynulla_Fatullayev\">Eynulla Fatullayev</a>, editor of the now closed independent weekly Realny Azerbaijan, and the brothers Sakit and Genimet Zakhidov with the pro-opposition Azadlyg newspaper. The journalists are serving jail terms on trumped-up charges such as hooliganism, drug possession, and terrorism. CPJ has found those charges to be fabricated and politically motivated.<br> The imprisonment of Eynulla Fatullayev is emblematic of the lengths to which Azerbaijani authorities have gone to stifle independent reporting on sensitive topics. Following his own dogged investigation into the contract-style murder in 2005 of his former boss and mentor, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4315439.stm\">Elmar Huseynov</a>, Fatullayev was slammed with a series of spurious charges \u2013 the heaviest of all being terrorism \u2013 and imprisoned for eight-and-a-half years. Fatullayev had angered the authorities by questioning their will to solve the murder, and reportedly finding and interviewing one of Huseynov's alleged killers.<br> With Fatullayev behind bars, there is no current scrutiny of the official investigation into Huseynov's assassination. The crime remains unsolved and Huseynov's killers are still at large. Following Huseynov's murder, the authorities in Azerbaijan have also failed to investigate severe attacks on at least eight journalists. CPJ interviewed the victims during a week-long trip to Baku in May, recording their disturbing accounts of government indifference, neglect, and, in at least one case, perceived complicity in the attacks.  Huseynov's family members spoke to CPJ of their own disappointment with the official conduct, calling the investigation confusing and secretive at best. Indeed, Azerbaijani authorities have been opaque about their progress towards finding Huseynov's killers. Lately, they have publicly ascribed primary responsibility for arresting the two alleged suspects \u2013 ethnic Azeri Georgian citizens Tair Hubavov and Teymuraz Aliyev \u2013 to Interpol. But the public record does not support that claim, CPJ research found. An official with Aliyev's administration assured CPJ that Azerbaijan remains \"fully committed\" to solving Huseynov's murder. But the public record does not support that assertion either.  The international community is busy \u2013 and rightly so \u2013 moderating the Georgia-Russia crisis and the east-west diplomatic rift it has caused. But we should not forget about Azerbaijan and we should call its government to account on its human rights record. Azer Akhmedov, the acting editor of Azadlyg newspaper told CPJ: \"You know, in a perfect world, it is logical for people to be happy when they have an energy resource. But in Azerbaijan, we say the opposite \u2013 we would be better off if we didn't have oil.\" </p> <p>Akhmedov, whose editor, Genimet Zakhidov, is in jail for \"hooliganism\", told CPJ Azerbaijan is \"cursed\" with by its oil resources and geographic position close to Iran. \"We're stuck between the devil and the deep blue sea,\" he told CPJ. \"We are faced with the reality that human rights are low down on the West's agenda.\" The international community should work to prove Akhmedov wrong \u2013 by demanding the release of all imprisoned journalists, the decriminalisation of libel, the timely and thorough investigation of violence against reporters, and calling on the Azerbaijani government to allow the press to do its job without fear of reprisal. </p> <p><em>Nina Ognianova is Europe and Central Asia Programme Coordinator for the Committee to Protect Journalists.</em></p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama and John McCain splashed out millions of dollars in an unprecedented ad campaign spree today in hopes that the Wall Street meltdown will give them a poll boost.</p> <p>Obama paid for an expensive two-minute slot - ads up until now have generally been limited to short 30-second bursts - to be shown nationally on cable television, in particular in the dozen battlefield states.</p> <p>His campaign team senses that Obama rather than McCain stands to benefit from the unsettling impact on voters of the financial collapses.</p> <p>McCain and Obama are deadlocked at present in the polls, a position that has stunned Republicans, given the obstacles faced by McCain, and dismayed Democrats.</p> <p>Obama's chief strategist, David Axelrod, claimed there was \"more urgency\" now about his team as it tries to regain the momentum lost to McCain over the last month.</p> <p>Given that 45% of voters describe the economy as the key issue of the election, the Obama campaign views the crisis as a piece of luck.</p> <p>The Democratic candidate's two-minute ad called for an end to \"the anything goes culture on Wall Street with real regulation that protects your investments and pensions\".</p> <p>McCain also put out a campaign ad, beginning early in the morning, aimed at trying to undo damage caused by his remark on Monday that the US economy was fundamentally strong.</p> <p>He sought to distance himself from George Bush's administration and, as he has all week, blamed corporate greed. He sought to reassure voters. \"Enough is enough,\" he says in the ad. \"I'll meet this financial crisis head on. Reform Wall Street\u2026your savings, your jobs I'll keep them safe.\"</p> <p>Neither Obama nor McCain have a background in economics. Obama has yet to establish a convincing message about how to tackle the economy and the inspirational rhetoric that is his trademark deserts him when he turns to economic matters. McCain long ago admitted he knew little about economics, having specialised in foreign affairs.</p> <p>Neil Newhouse, a Republican pollster, acknowledged today that the Wall Street meltdown should help Obama. But he added the poll advantage will go to \"the first of the two who finds his voice\". The rival teams are awaiting the first polls taken on Monday and Tuesday that will reflect voters' response to events on Wall Street. A Reuters-Zogby poll, released today and taken over the weekend amid rumours of the impending crisis, gave Obama a 2% lead nationally over McCain, 47% to 45%. That wipes out a 5% lead enjoyed by McCain a month ago.</p> <p>Many of the campaign ads put out by Obama and McCain usually receive only limited release, intended mainly for media consumption. It is a sign of how important the two teams judge the present moment that they are prepared to spend big on this occasion. Normally, a candidate would only buy a two-minute slot at the closing stage of a campaign.</p> <p>Both McCain and Obama were careful not to support the Bush administration's bail-out of the insurance giant, AIG. Obama described it as \"the final verdict\" on the failure of the crony capitalism of the last eight years. He said the bail-out should help families that rely on the insurance, not the shareholders or management of AIG.</p> <p>Obama had enjoyed a two-digit lead - 16% in one poll - over McCain on the economy only a few weeks ago and had watched this evaporate to just a few points last week.</p> <p>The seriousness of the crisis has more-or-less led to a temporary halt in negative personal attacks. Republicans, without much enthusiasm, tried to exploit the $9m (\u00a35m) Obama raised at a Hollywood bash on Tuesday night, citing it as evidence of obsession with celebrities. But the issue was drowned out by the latest financial news.</p>",
  "<p>Short sellers in New York and London are facing tough new regulations as market officials attempt to curb what they see as \"abusive\" attacks on the proper functioning of stock markets \u2014 particularly the pricing of banking and financial stocks.</p> <p>The US Securities and Exchange Commission will tomorrow impose new rules designed to end \"price manipulating\" through aggressive short selling. Earlier this week the chancellor, Alistair Darling, signalled the Financial Services Authority was also looking at closer policing of certain short-selling activities.</p> <p>Hedge funds betting on a drop in the Lehman Brothers share price are estimated to have made a windfall of more than $3bn when the investment bank filed for bankruptcy protection on Monday, rendering shares as good as worthless. Even bigger gains were made by short sellers when rival Bear Sterns failed in March.</p> <p>One of the most successful speculators to profit from the demise of Lehman was New York-based hedge fund Greenlight Capital, run by 37-year-old founder David Einhorn. </p> <p>In recent months Einhorn, a bridge and poker enthusiast known for his love of afternoon napping, has become a posterboy for short sellers. He has shown himself unafraid to publicly criticise firms he has targeted \u2014 particularly Lehman. </p> <p>The Greenlight boss has joked that he expects a subpoena from regulators for his efforts, but insists he is truth-seeker not a panic-sower. He has a reputation for leaving a maelstrom of fear and anger in his wake.</p> <p>Meanwhile, regulators have grown increasingly concerned at the market-moving power of hedge funds that circulate critical research or publicly attack companies in which they hold short positions. Concern is deepest when funds target banks that operate in markets where the ability to trade is highly sensitive to investor confidence.</p> <p>Short sellers like Greenlight borrow shares and sell them in the market in the hope the shares can eventually be bought back at a lower price before being returned to the lender. The difference between the sale and purchase price becomes the shorter's profit.</p> <p>But in fast-moving markets experienced hedge funds and others have been able to take up short positions without having first borrowed shares. Put another way, they have been contracting to sell shares that they have not yet borrowed.</p> <p>It is this practice, known as \"naked shorting\", that the SEC now has in its sights. From tomorrow, the regulator is tightening rules on short selling \u2014 though it stops short of outlawing naked shorts.</p> <p>\"These several actions today make it crystal clear that the SEC has zero tolerance for abusive naked short selling,\" said SEC chairman Christopher Cox.</p> <p>The regulator said naked shorting \"can allow manipulators to force prices down far lower than would be possible in legitimate short-selling conditions.\"</p> <p>Earlier this week Alistair Darling sought to draw a similar distinction between \"legitimate hedging\", such as practiced by airlines protecting themselves from oil price rises, and \"speculation that can be quite harmful\".</p> <p>\"The Financial Services Authority has been looking at that problem with a view to taking action to try and stop that because it can be extremely damaging.\" he told BBC Radio 4.</p> <p>But there are some doubt about the likely effectiveness of regulatory reforms. In 2005 a previous attempt by the SEC to clamp down on naked shorting was quickly found to contain easily exploited loopholes which allowed existing practices to continue almost unchecked.</p> <p>In July this year the US regulator imposed further restrictions on short selling methods in relation to 19 financial stocks including Lehman, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as well as European banks Barclays, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Royal Bank of Scotland and HSBC. </p> <p>But the move appeared to do little to curb the increasingly large short bets being placed by hedge funds on vulnerable financial stocks.</p> <p>It is difficult to monitor exactly how much a stock is being shorted, but the amount of shares that have been loaned out by investors is the best available proxy. Figures from research house Dataexplorers.com show about 10% of Leman's shares had been loaned out since early March. </p> <p>There was another wave of short selling interest in Lehman last week with a further 8% of shares being loaned out. By Friday 17.8% of now worthless Lehman shares \u2014 owned by institutional investors and pension funds \u2014 had been loaned out. The vast majority will have been short-sold months ago by hedge funds taking huge bets on the investment bank's woes spiralling.</p> <p>Einhorn, who two years ago briefly enjoyed some celebrity on the Las Vegas poker circuit after winning $660,000 at the World Series of Poker tournament, has remained unrepentant. He believes himself to be providing Wall Street and the global financial markets with a well overdue reality check. </p> <p>\"Investment banks claim they are in the 'moving' business rather than the 'storage' business, but the very nature of some of their holdings suggests that this is not true. And they hold this stuff on tremendously levered balance sheets,\" he explained at a hedge fund conference in April.</p> <p>\"How did this happen? The answer is that the investment banks outmanoeuvred the watchdogs ... As a result, with no one watching, the managements of the investment banks did exactly what they were incentivised to do: maximise employee compensation. Investment banks pay out 50% of revenues as compensation. More leverage, means more revenues, which means more compensation.\"</p> <p>Aware of the acrimony he has attracted, Einhorn joked: \"Based on the current regulatory environment, the pessimistic side of me says that regulators will probably decide to send me a subpoena and send Lehman a Coke.\"</p> <p>The sniping was too much for Lehman chief executive Richard Fuld, who has called for the SEC to ban short selling. In April he told investors at an annual shareholder meeting: \"I will hurt the shorts, and that is my goal.\"</p> <p>A month later Lehman continued its counterattack, issuing a statement claiming Einhorn \"cherry-picks certain specific items from our [financial filings] and takes them out of context and distorts them to relay a false impression of the firm's financial condition, which suits him because of his short position in our stock.\"</p> <p>Einhorn appears to have had the last word, though he did tell reporters in June he was not wishing for the collapse of Lehman. \"We would not win if Lehman went down and took the whole financial system with it. An actual collapse of Lehman - that would not be a good thing.\"</p>",
  "<p>Lawyers and Republican aides acting on behalf of Sarah Palin are<br>engaged in a fierce legal battle to block an inquiry into the so-<br>called \"Troopergate\" affair, in which the vice-presidential<br>candidate is accused of abusing her public office to wage a<br>personal vendetta against her former brother-in-law.</p> <p>The bi-partisan panel of the Alaskan state legislature in charge of<br>the inquiry is coming under intense pressure to drop the<br>proceedings, or bump them into the long grass until after the<br>November 4 presidential elections. In the latest move, five<br>Republican members of the state assembly have issued a lawsuit<br>seeking to halt the investigation on the grounds that it is<br>\"McCarthyistic, partial and partisan\".</p> <p>Yesterday, the Republican attorney general of Alaska also ruled<br>that 13 witnesses subpoenaed to appear before the inquiry would not<br>have to be honoured.</p> <p>The Democratic head of the panel, Hollis French, has vowed to press<br>on with the inquiry, which is due to report on October 10. In a<br>recent interview with the Guardian he said: \"Sarah Palin's<br>nomination as vice-presidential candidate really doesn't change the<br>steps we are going through to complete the investigation, it just<br>raises its visibility significantly.\"</p> <p>The rapidly escalating campaign of disruption launched by the Palin<br>camp is an indication of how seriously Troopergate is being taken<br>within Republican ranks. Allegations about her misuse of her<br>position as governor of Alaska for personal reasons are potentially<br>damaging to John McCain's presidential hopes as he has billed his<br>running mate as an ethical choice who will combat corruption and<br>cronyism in Washington.</p> <p>At the heart of the affair is the accusation that Palin sacked the<br>head of the Alaskan police service, safety commissioner Walt<br>Monegan, because he refused to take a tough stance against her<br>former brother-in-law who works as a state police officer or<br>trooper. Mike Wooten and Palin's sister Molly were involved in an<br>acrimonious divorce.</p> <p>It has emerged that Palin, her husband Todd and several of her<br>closest aides complained about Wooten to Monegan on at least a<br>dozen occasions, urging him to dismiss the trooper or have him<br>moved. Monegan consistently resisted their advances, until he was<br>himself fired.</p> <p>In an interview with the Wall Street Journal today Monegan<br>said: \"The first thing I said when I was told I was fired was, 'Is<br>it because of Wooten?'\"</p> <p>The union representing Wooten, the Public Safety Employees<br>Association, points out that the trooper was investigated several<br>years ago over alleged improprieties raised by Palin and others,<br>that included the shooting of a cow moose without a proper licence.</p> <p>Wooten was found in breach on some charges and suspended for five<br>days, at which point the case was closed.</p> <p>But soon after Palin became governor in November 2006 the<br>accusations were raised again. In one email to Monegan she wrote:<br>\"Amazing. [Wooten]'s still a trooper, and he still carries a gun,<br>and he still tells anyone who will listen that he will 'never work<br>for that bitch, Palin' because he has such anger and distain (sic)<br>towards my family.\"</p> <p>John Cyr, the union's director, told the Guardian:<br>\"What the governor has done is unconscionable. She has used the<br>bully pulpit of the governor's office to demonise a man who was<br>trying to do his job and raise his family.\"</p> <p>In her defence, Palin says she sacked the police chief not because<br>he refused to act against her former relative, but because he had<br>shown \"insubordination\" towards her over the management of the<br>police budget.</p> <p>Palin has a long track record of blurring the lines between her<br>public and private lives. A recent investigation by the New York<br>Times revealed that as governor she has appointed several former<br>school classmates to senior positions.</p>",
  "<p>The west's efforts to use the United Nations to promote its values and shape the global agenda are failing, according to a detailed study published today.</p> <p>A sea change in the balance of power in favour of China, India, Russia and other emerging states is wrecking European and US efforts to entrench human rights, liberties and multilateralism. Western policies in crisis regions as diverse as Georgia, Zimbabwe, Burma or the Balkans are suffering serial defeats in what the study identifies as a protracted trend.</p> <p>The haemorrhaging of western power, as reflected in longer-term voting patterns in key UN bodies, is mirrored by the increasing clout of China, Russia and the Islamic world, according to an audit of European influence at the UN by the European Council on Foreign Relations.</p> <p>\"The EU is suffering a slow-motion crisis at the UN,\" says the report, noting that the west is now being regularly outwitted in global diplomatic poker by the Chinese and Russians. \"The problem is fading power to set the rules. The UN is increasingly being shaped by China, Russia and their allies \u2026 The west is in disarray. The EU's rifts with the US on many human rights issues at the UN in the Bush era have weakened both.\"</p> <p>US and European failure to win the day at the UN security council in recent votes on Zimbabwe and Burma as well as defeats last year on Kosovo or Darfur and the constant struggle to muster support for global action against Iran because of its nuclear ambitions are traced as part of a broader decline over the past decade.</p> <p>Using a programme designed to analyse voting patterns and statistics, the thinktank found that European policies on human rights enjoyed the support of 72% of UN members a decade ago but only 48% by last year, while the US suffered a steeper collapse from 77% to 30%.</p> <p>\"The pattern of votes in the general assembly shows that opposition to the EU is growing, spurred by a common resistance to European efforts at promoting human rights,\" said the study.</p> <p>The beneficiaries of this disaffection with the west have been China and Russia, which defend national sovereignty and non-intervention in sovereign countries no matter how grievous the atrocities and human rights violations blamed on national governments. Over the past decade support for Chinese and Russian stances on human rights issues has soared from less than 50% to 74% in the UN general assembly.</p> <p>The assembly kicked off this week in New York with the west bracing itself for another debacle. Serbia is to use the session to demand a vote on the \"illegality\" of the secession last February of Kosovo, whose breakaway was strongly backed by the US and most of the EU, and to refer the dispute to the UN's international court of justice. Despite strenuous lobbying by the Europeans to prevent the vote, they have conceded defeat. Only 46 of the 192 UN states have recognised Kosovo's independence. And western attempts to rally support for Georgia in the Caucasus crisis will be rebuffed by the Russians.</p> <p>\"The EU has collectively failed to adapt to new power trends,\" said Martti Ahtisaari, the former Finnish president and a chairman of the thinktank.<br>The setbacks for the west at the UN in New York are compounded by a worse record in winning the battles for rights and freedoms at the Geneva-based UN Human Rights Council. In March the Islamic bloc changed the mandate for the council's rapporteur on freedom of expression, charging him, in the wake of the Danish cartoons crisis, with the obligation to record blasphemy. Critics said the post was supposed to function as an agent of liberty, but became an instrument of repression. </p> <p>\"The head of steam building up in the Islamic world for worldwide defamation legislation is huge,\" said Keith Porteous-Wood, director of Britain's National Secular Society. \"The Human Rights Council can no longer serve a useful purpose.\"</p> <p>In the council's two-year existence, the 19 European countries on the 47-strong body have been marginalised, mired in despair and a sense of futility after losing more than half the votes conducted.</p> <p>The poor European record on winning the world's hearts and minds contrasts with Brussels' habit of talking up the merits of its \"soft power\" attractiveness and indicates that the EU's huge financial investment in being the world's biggest aid donor and the UN's biggest funder is not translating into political gains.</p>",
  "<p>Members of Israel's ruling Kadima party are today voting for a new leader, with opinion polls suggesting that the foreign minister, Tzipi Livni, could become the country's first female prime minister in more than 30 years.</p> <p>Opinion polls put Livni, a former Mossad agent and lawyer with only a decade's experience in politics, some way ahead of her closest challenger, the transport minister and hawkish former army chief Shaul Mofaz. </p> <p>If she wins and forms a government, she would be the first female prime minister since Golda Meir resigned in 1974.</p> <p>However, analysts warned that the vote would be difficult to call. Polls are open until late tonight, and a result is not expected before early tomorrow.</p> <p>If one candidate wins more than 40% of the vote, they will then be given 42 days to form a coalition government. If no coalition is agreed then new elections must be held within three months. </p> <p>Until then, the prime minister, Ehud Olmert - who is facing several corruption investigations and has promised to resign after the vote - would probably stay on as a caretaker.</p> <p>Around 74,000 members of Kadima are eligible to vote, and a low turnout might favour Mofaz, whose campaign is thought to have been better organised. </p> <p>Israel's Ynet news website said only 28% of voters had turned out by 6pm local time, but more were expected for the last four hours of voting.</p> <p>Livni voted in Tel Aviv and encouraged others to turn out, saying: \"You can determine today what the character of Kadima will be.\" </p> <p>\"You can determine today if you really have had enough of old-time politics. Come and vote, bring your children, and show them how you are changing the country.\"</p> <p>Mofaz, as he has often done in recent weeks, emphasised his security background as a former general and defence minister. </p> <p>\"The state of Israel stands before major challenges in the coming years and needs a strong leader who has the courage to decide and the ability to act,\" he told Israeli Army Radio. </p> <p>On Sunday, he predicted he would win the vote, even promising to take the election with exactly 43%.</p> <p>One of the most recent polls, carried out for the Ma'ariv newspaper on Monday, suggested the gap between the two leading contenders was shrinking but still put Livni well ahead on 42.5% against Mofaz on 30.4%. </p> <p>The two other candidates, the internal security minister, Avi Dichter, and Meir Sheetrit, the tourism minister, are a long way behind.<br> If none of the candidates reaches 40%, a run-off vote will be held next week.</p> <p>Although Livni, 50, and 59-year-old Mofaz are from the same party, there are marked differences in their views. </p> <p>Livni has been closely involved in the last year of negotiations with the Palestinians, and is expected to continue the process if she wins. She argues in favour of a Palestinian state, but is adamantly opposed to the return of a single Palestinian refugee into what is now Israel. </p> <p>Mofaz has been much more sceptical about the idea of talks with the Palestinians - last week he told an Israeli newspaper the negotiations had been a \"waste of time\" - but supports the idea of a two-state solution to the conflict. </p> <p>He has also taken a much tougher line on Iran and its nuclear ambitions, saying earlier this year that he thought war was \"unavoidable\".</p> <p>Some Israeli commentators have been distinctly unimpressed. Sima Kadmon, writing in today's Yedioth Ahronoth, said she thought both lacked charisma and leadership ability. </p> <p>\"It is not an easy choice. Choosing between Tzipi Livni and Shaul Mofaz is like choosing between two shades of grey,\" she wrote.</p>",
  "<p>More <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2008/09/17/palin_mayor/print.html\">terrific stuff</a> from Anchorage by Salon's David Talbot.</p> <p>1. Did Palin use public moneys (around $30,000) to refurbish her mayoral office? That's the recollection of her estranged erstwhile mentor:</p> <blockquote> <p>Although Carney says he no longer has documentation of the expenditures, in his recollection Palin paid for the office face-lift with money from a city highway fund that was used to plow snow, grade roads and fill potholes -- essential municipal services, particularly in weather-battered Alaska.<br> Carney confronted Mayor Palin at a City Council hearing, and was shocked by her response. \"I braced her about it,\" he said. \"I told her it was against the law to make such a large expenditure without the council taking a vote. She said, 'I'm the mayor, I can do whatever I want until the courts tell me I can't.'\" </p> </blockquote> <p>2. She was pretty clearly in over her head as mayor! For example:</p> <blockquote> <p>Other local officials -- who lack Carney's acrimonious history with Palin -- share his dim view of her mayoral reign. When Palin ran for mayor, she dismissed concerns about her lack of managerial expertise by saying the job was \"not rocket science.\" But after a tumultuous start, marked by controversial firings and lawsuits against the city, Palin felt compelled to hire a city manager named John Cramer to steady the ship.<br> \"Sarah was unprepared to be mayor -- it was John Cramer who actually ran the city,\" said Michelle Church, a member of the Mat-Su Borough Assembly, who knows Palin socially. \"As vice-president she'll certainly have to rely on faceless advisors with no public accountability. Haven't we had enough of that in the past eight years?\"</p> </blockquote> <p>We have indeed, Michelle, we have indeed.<br></p>",
  "<p>People in power often admit to dreaming of what they will do when they leave office. Some dream of making millions with memoirs and speech tours, while others may just want to enjoy a lie-in. But Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel, has an altogether more ambitious dream - mastering the balance beam.</p> <p>In an interview with a woman's magazine Merkel said she wished she could be a gymnast and conquer the art of turning and leaping on the beam, the 1.25m-high apparatus used in women's gymnastics and which requires a great deal of elegance, endurance and precision.</p> <p>\"I wish I could do gymnastics on the balance beam,\" she told Frau im Spiegel, adding that she would also like to brush up her French and study law. But before her critics were able to weigh in and question Merkel's suitability for gymnastics - her sporting prowess, by her own admission, stretches just to walking, cross-country skiing and gardening - she added: \"I have long ago come to terms with the fact that it is not my forte.\" </p> <p>Merkel, 54, who was voted the most powerful woman in the world for the second time by Forbes magazine last month, has admitted in the past that she was often terrified of sports lessons, especially jumping and gymnastics. She said sport and handicrafts had never been her strengths, and she had been reliant on patient sports teachers to motivate her \"rather than the ones who stand at the sidelines waiting to see you bodge it up yet again\".</p> <p>Merkel's remarks were made on the sidelines of an extensive tour of Germany's schools as part of her campaign to put education at the top of her government's political agenda under the slogan \"no education, no prosperity\". The trained physicist who gave up science for politics nearly 20 years ago, said that physics had given her the ability to \"distinguish between what is important and what is not, and to work very precisely\".</p>",
  "<p>It may be impossible to sum up in words <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2008/07/11/ST2008071100041.html\">how purposefully</a> the Bush administration has delayed addressing the threat of climate change. The prospect of a new president who is committed to limiting carbon emissions has <a href=\"http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/15/obama-and-mccain-no-climate-doubt/\">sparked new hope</a> that the US can come back from the brink of environmental laxity.</p> <p>And today we see another potential sign of positive change on the horizon. <br><br>The US environmental protection agency, the same body that was <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=massachusetts+versus+epa&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a\">dragged into court</a> for dragging its feet on climate policy, has named Deborah Swackhamer the new chief of its Science Advisory Board (SAB), the independent panel that gives advice on the impact of government regulations.</p> <p>Happily, Swackhamer <a href=\"http://www.minnpost.com/sharonschmickle/2008/01/18/611/global_warmings_pressing_moral_question\">is a strong proponent</a> of sacrifice and conservation to control emissions.</p> <p>\"We can't afford to wait,\" the University of Minnesota water resources scientist said earlier this year. \"We must make these changes now for our children to see an impact.\"</p> <p>The SAB was plagued during the first year of the Bush administration by allegations of corruption and conflicts of interest among its ostensibly independent members. Swackhamer's two-year appointment is an encouraging sign -- particularly if the next president and his advisers pay her perspective more heed than that of her predecessor, M Granger Morgan of Carnegie Mellon university, who <a href=\"http://www.innovations-report.de/html/berichte/umwelt_naturschutz/bericht-74550.html\">has long urged</a> the Bush administration to act on climate change.</p>",
  "<p>John Denham, secretary of state for Innovation, Universities and Skills argued in this week's Education Guardian that \"as a society, we have a duty to seek out and nurture the talent of our young people irrespective of their social background, and the same must apply to our educational institutions\".<br> This seems to contradict the stance taken by the Royal Society in forcing the resignation of Prof Michael Reiss from his position as part-time director of education on secondment from his post of professor of science education at the Institute of Education, University of London. </p> <p>From all the media evidence, it appears that Reiss's argument that science teachers need to be aware of their students' faith, social and cultural backgrounds in teaching evolutionary biology were ignored in favour of a particular scientific stance. <br><br>The Royal Society, supposedly representing the very best of research in science, bowed to pressure from a small number of its fellows. </p> <p>The general question of the relationship between science and society is currently very high on the government's agenda. </p> <p>Denham's department is seeking responses to a major consultation document to ensure more effective and productive relationships between research scientists and the wider community, including public policy-makers. </p> <p>At the launch of the initiative almost a year ago, Dius conceived of \"science\" in very narrow and traditional terms. It paid scant attention to what was meant by society, assuming this could be taken as read. </p> <p>Over the ensuing months, the government, with evidence from social scientists, has begun to modify this perspective and acknowledge that scientific research may include the social sciences. </p> <p>Social scientific research provides evidence of how a complex society may be, for example, made up of a diversity of faith, social and cultural groups.<br> <br>The media furore over the Royal Society's director of education provides ample evidence of the complexity of these issues. </p> <p>First, it illustrates that there are clear controversies over what is meant by science, even in the field of evolutionary biology, and also what is meant by society. </p> <p>Second, it illustrates that research scientists may have very little knowledge or understanding of the processes of teaching and learning in either schools or higher education. </p> <p>Third, it demonstrates the lack of awareness about current research evidence on teaching and learning, and particularly about science education in schools and universities. </p> <p>The economic and social research council's <a href=\"http://www.tlrp.org/\"> Teaching and Learning Research Programme</a> has undertaken some 70 research projects over the last eight years, providing a massive array of evidence about the complexities of teaching and learning. <br> <br>We have distilled this into 10 evidence-informed principles about effective teaching and learning, to guide policy and practice. </p> <p>One of these principles is that teaching and learning should engage with the big ideas, facts, processes, language and narratives of its subjects so that learners understand what constitutes quality and standards in particular disciplines. </p> <p>In this case, we might cite evolutionary biology as an example for science education.</p> <p>However, we also argue that teaching should take account of what learners know already, in order to plan their next steps. This means building upon prior learning as well as taking into account the personal and cultural experiences of different groups. </p> <p>Here we would want to acknowledge that in science classrooms in both schools and universities, there is a diversity of social, cultural and faith groups. Teachers and academics need to be aware of this diversity to develop appropriate and inclusive practices, whether natural or social scientists. </p> <p>Surely the Royal Society would wish to follow the secretary of state's arguments, and base its educational provision on scientifically based knowledge about teaching and learning?</p> <p>We hope that it will learn from this sorry episode and base its policies on a more secure understanding of teaching and learning. If it does not, its ambitions to improve UK science education are likely to remain disappointed.</p> <p>\u2022 Miriam David is associate director (higher education) of the Teaching and Learning Research Programme at the Institute of Education, University of London</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/list/atoz#keyword13\">Lehman Brothers</a> staff in the UK were thrown a lifeline today when Barclays said it might include some of the investment bank's London operations in a deal to buy its north American business.</p> <p>John Varley, Barclays chief executive, said the bank had \"opportunities but no obligation\" to buy parts of Lehman outside the US.</p> <p>\"We have acquired assets in the US and we are now looking quickly and seriously to see what might fit with the businesses we have around the world,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Are we required to acquire other assets in this transaction? No. Are there people whose activities are complementary to the businesses we are buying? It is possible to contemplate that and [we are] looking at that.\"</p> <p>Barclays agreed a $1.75bn (\u00a3980m) deal to buy the core business of Lehman Brothers, the investment bank that filed for bankruptcy on Monday amid one of Wall Street's worst crises.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/17/barclay.lehmanbrothers1\">bank issued a statement at around 2am today</a> in the UK confirming it would buy Lehman's North American investment banking and capital markets business. That saves around 10,000 jobs on Wall Street. Barclays said yesterday the deal secures about half the revenue stream of the old Lehman Brothers.</p> <p>Bob Diamond, the Barclays president who led the negotiations, said the deal was a \"once in a lifetime opportunity for Barclays\". He said the focus of interest in the UK would be the equity and capital markets business. \"We wouldn't want to miss the opportunity to add some talent from the UK and Europe.\"</p> <p>Varley said Barclays had been considering a deal with Lehman for some months, as it became apparent the bank was heading for trouble.</p> <p>The agreement makes Barclays one of the leading banks on Wall Street, with capabilities across equity and debt markets, mergers and acquisitions, commodities trading and foreign exchange. The businesses will be merged into Barclays Capital, though it is not clear whether the Lehman name, one of the oldest on Wall Street, will disappear in the short term.</p> <p>The deal still needs to be approved by the bankruptcy court.</p> <p>Barclays is paying $250m cash and taking on $72bn in trading assets and $68bn in trading liabilities. They include mortgage assets, equities, corporate debt, government bonds and commercial paper.</p> <p>The bank gave further detail on the assets yesterday. It said less than 5% were mortgages, that these had been marked down and were further so during due diligence. Barclays said the assets and liabilities being acquired had been through \"quite a cleansing process\", adding it had been given the chance to pick and choose assets and had been doing due diligence since the weekend.</p> <p>Barclays said the deal would enhance its capital ratio, rather than prove detrimental, and be earnings accretive. \"We have tried to be very disciplined in the way we have managed our balance sheet and you should assume those disciplines remain in place,\" Varley said.</p> <p>He underlined how important it had been to get the deal done quickly to prevent an exodus of staff and clients. Staff have been clearing their desks and walking out with bags or cardboard boxes full of possessions since it became apparent on Sunday evening that the firm was finished. He said that, as far as he was aware, Barclays was the only bidder.</p> <p>A deadline for completing the deal to buy the North American business has been set for a week today.</p> <p>In addition, Barclays is paying $1.5bn for the Lehman headquarters, a glass and steel tower just north of Times Square in New York, and two data centres in New Jersey. The bank said the price represented the buildings' market values.</p> <p>The agreement is being supported by certain \"strategic\" investors in the bank, who have agreed to subscribe to at least $1bn of new equity. Barclays did not name which investors would be supporting the deal, but Qatar Investment Authority, China Development Bank and Singapore's Temasek are among its large shareholders.</p> <p>Lehman renewed contact with Barclays on Monday afternoon to see if it would still be interested in some of its assets. Diamond, who led the failed weekend negotiations to take control of Lehman, had remained in the US and worked through the night to hammer out an agreement.</p> <p>The bank filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, which provides protection from creditors while it liquidates its business. The operations in the UK were put into administration and staff reacted with shock and anger as they turned up for work on Monday and were told, in most cases, to go back home again.</p> <p>Barclays has grown its investment banking division rapidly under Diamond's 10 years at the top. He was involved in disbanding the bank's last disastrous foray into global financial markets, BZW, and there have been some concerns the bank might repeat mistakes.</p> <p>Barclays said the deal would give it a top three position in US capital markets. The firm said it would also extend Barclays Capital's range of investment banking products, with the addition of Lehman's strong M&amp;A and equity capital markets franchises in the US. The deal will result in a significant lift to the amount of earnings from the US. </p> <p>\"We will now have the best team and most productive culture across the world's major financial markets, backed by the resources of an integrated universal bank,\" Diamond said.</p>",
  "<p>It started in New York, at the Marc Jacobs show, with cute shrunken, flattened Stephen Jones hats worn at a perilous angle.

Updating the language of the Suicide Act, however, should help to reassure people that the internet is not a lawless environment and that we can meet the challenges of the digital world.</p> <p>\"It is important, particularly in an area of such wide public interest and concern, for the law to be expressed in terms that everyone can understand.\"</p> <p>Eagle said the move would help internet service providers police the sites they host.</p> <p>A spate of deaths in Bridgend, south Wales, raised fears teenagers were using the web to plan and discuss killing themselves.</p> <p>A recent study found people searching online for ways to kill themselves were more likely to come across sites encouraging them to take their own lives than those offering help.</p> <p>Today's move follows a government report from the parenting expert Tanya Byron on child safety on the web.

  "<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_&amp;_Order\">Law &amp; Order</a> is the only American TV show to have started in 1990 and still be going strong. Its detectives and DAs may have had limited success in keeping the bad guys off the streets of Manhattan, but in its 18 years the programme has become a global phenomenon and spawned two successful spin-offs, <a href=\"http://www.nbc.com/Law_and_Order_Special_Victims_Unit/\">Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nbc.com/Law_&amp;_Order:_Criminal_Intent/\">Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent</a>.</p> <p>Unlike other legal dramas, which show either police procedure or lawyers' negotiations, L&amp;O broke new ground by portraying the judicial process from the discovery of a crime (usually murder or rape, often both) to the outcome of the trial. This keeps things interesting and gives viewers an insight into all of the considerations and complications of making a case.</p> <p>Sure, it can be samey sometimes. After almost two decades, there aren't many story lines that will still surprise viewers. But all the Law &amp; Order franchises are well-made and fast-paced, capturing New York in all its gritty glory whilst somehow managing to make the city seem glamorous at the same time.</p> <p>So it's understandable that producers would want to emulate its success: countless New York cop dramas (from <a href=\"http://www.thirdwatch.co.uk/\">Third Watch</a> to <a href=\"http://www.cbs.com/primetime/without_a_trace/\">Without a Trace</a>) have tried to recapture the Law &amp; Order magic, but none has bettered it.</p> <p>The last spin-off anyone would expect to see (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/garethmcleanblog/2008/jan/04/dowereallyneedlaworderlo \">well, apart from Gareth McLean in January</a>) is a UK version of the show. But according to an announcement <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/sep/08/itv.television?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=media\">earlier this week</a>, that is exactly what ITV is planning. This new programme will throw together ex-Dr Who companion <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLnSphQ88_w\">Freema Agyeman</a> and ex-Corrie star <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\" u9ktcdfmz1g\" \">Bradley Walsh</a>, replicate the American show's title and format and hope the results spell success. More likely they will spell disaster. Walsh's cheeky Cockney copper is hardly the kind of character who would show up in an L&amp;O script.</p> <p>Although <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\" nnn_bgxzkxm\" \">Dick Wolf</a>, creator of the original series, has pledged that his company will co-produce the British version, I can't see it giving the American show any competition in the ratings stakes, even on this side of the pond.</p> <p>In fact, it only shows how far ITV is behind the BBC. Instead of original content like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_on_Mars_(TV_series)\">Life on Mars</a>, ITV is trying to re-work an American stalwart without the acting talent or production values to back it up.</p> <p>From the camp and improbable <a href=\"http://www.midsomermurders.net/\">Midsomer Murders</a>, to the overblown drama of <a href=\"http://www.thebill.com/page.asp?partid=1\">The Bill</a>, British cop shows have always lagged behind their American counterparts, managing to look cheap and unrealistic instead of dramatic and lifelike. British police dramas are usually ploddy (no pun intended) and slow. And however well meaning ITV may be, their new programme seems unlikely to buck this trend.</p> <p>In fact, while fans of the original series live for the \"bing bing!\" that signals the start of a new episode, I can't help thinking that anyone watching the British version will be living for whatever sound signals the closing credits.</p>",
  "<p>It could not have been more ironic. On the very day that South African President Thabo Mbeki finally sealed a desperately needed <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7617731.stm\">power-sharing deal</a> in neighbouring Zimbabwe between the ruling Zanu-PF and the opposition Movement for Democratic Change, his own ANC is <a href=\"http://www.int.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=6&amp;art_id=nw20080917141408106C767629\">debating</a> whether to impeach him for behaving autocratically.</p> <p>It sums up the legacy of a man who promised so much, in terms of building democracy at home and in Africa, but who failed woefully to live up to his own rhetorical flourishes. The ANC's national working committee, which runs its day-to-day affairs, has now agreed to fire Mbeki, pending legal advice.</p> <p>Mbeki had hoped that delivering a deal in Zimbabwe would help restore some of the lost credibility at home and in his ruling ANC. This is not to be. Mbeki sees this Zimbabwean deal as a vindication of his much derided \"quiet diplomacy\" over Western gunboat diplomacy, and finally a victory for his personal dictum of \"African solutions for Africa's problems\". But many within the ANC believe a tougher approach earlier on may have ultimately been less costly. </p> <p>Judge Chris Nicholson's judgment last Friday, which temporary dismissed Jacob Zuma's corruption trial because the prosecutors did not follow the proper procedures, also damned Mbeki for using public institutions to trip up opponents, giving his local opponents the ammunition they have long been waiting for to dismiss him. </p> <p>Mbeki's biggest error in the last decade was to naively believe Zimbabwean strongman Robert Mugabe's promises of better behaviour, only to be betrayed later as the old tyrant backtracked. </p> <p>The fact that this is a deal worked out by Africans themselves should not obscure its inherent flaws. The big worry remains that in the power-sharing agreement in Zimbabwe, like the one in Kenya, the opposition party and leader that actually won the poll got short-changed, while the sitting leader and government that cheated are richly rewarded. </p> <p>That itself is a recipe for future instability. It means African dictators can rig the vote but retain their power by threatening more violence and by agreeing to African mediation. Instead of a short, transitional government Mugabe is now entrenched for a full term in office. </p> <p>Admittedly, Mugabe has ceded some presidential powers and given Morgan Tsvangirai additional powers as executive prime minister \u2013 on paper, a 50:50 split of power. Control over the security forces has been divided, with Mugabe running the military and intelligence services and Tsvangirai in charge of the police. Tsvangirai also gets the finance department, with responsibility to resuscitate the economy \u2013 driven to the brink of collapse by Mugabe's kleptocracy, back to life. </p> <p>This cannot happen without generous western financial help and support from Zimbabweans in the diaspora who fled Mugabe's terror. All the repressive laws are still on the books. Those that committed human rights abuses are not being prosecuted, neither are their victims being compensated. </p> <p>Mugabe has only agreed to these very minimal concessions because of the hard reality that the state is now bankrupt, and there is no outside financial help forthcoming unless he agreed to share power. The threat of further sanctions tightened the screws more. </p> <p>Among African peers his support dwindled as it became clear that his bogus claims to fight western domination on behalf of other Africans was shown for what is: a fake, used to disguise his and his junta's fact looting of Zimbabwe and terrorising of its citizens. </p> <p>By supporting Mugabe instead of the long-suffering people of Zimbabwe, African leaders undermined their own fight against global inequality in politics, trade and finance. This has been clear for some time now to the ruling ANC in South Africa, although evidently not to Mbeki. When the party pointed this out to Mbeki, he characteristically ignored the counsel. </p> <p>For some time now, the ANC rightly believed that increasing pressure on Mugabe and his junta was the best way to prevent further loss of life, economic decline and more refugees fleeing into South Africa. </p> <p>The ANC had changed from seeing Zanu-PF and other errant liberation movements as friends only because they, too, fought colonial powers, no matter how brutal their record in power. Mbeki ignored this. </p> <p>The ANC endorsed MDC and its leader Morgan Tsvangirai as the legitimate winners of the March 2008 elections, and wanted them to be appropriately rewarded \u2013 not Mugabe.

  "<p>As students across America settle in to college, the Associated Press <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26410431/\">brings word</a> that hundreds of institutions have invested in one of the year's more macabre teaching tools: an instructional kit on what to do when a gun-wielding assassin bursts interrupts class.<br><br>The programme, complete with a video showing a gunman opening fire in a packed classroom, urges students and their teachers to be \"ready to respond\" to an intending shooter by taking advantage of what it hails as \"the inherent strength in numbers\", in a nation where memories of the campus massacres at Virginia Tech and Northern Illinois University remain fresh and <a href=\"http://www.visaliatimesdelta.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080828/OPINION01/808280301\">helpful tips on handling similar situations</a> are a common media fixture. </p> <p>Rather than cowering in a corner or huddling together in fear, faculty members are urged \"to be aware of their surroundings and to think of common classroom objects \u2014 such as laptops and backpacks \u2014 as 'improvised weapons'\", the wire service reports, noting that the training tool has already been bought by nearly 500 academic institutions. </p> <p>The training programme is marketed by the Centre for Personal Protection and Safety, a commercial operation based in Washington state, which on this occasion appears to have simply customised an earlier programme designed to assist company workers survive a similar situation in the office setting.</p> <p>The centre is big on people developing what it describes as a \"proactive mindset\".</p> <p>\"The odds of being involved in an 'active shooter' situation are similar to being struck by lightning,\" notes <a href=\"http://www.cppssite.com/pressroom,3,thecenterforpersonalprotectionsafetyrelease\">its publicity material</a>. \"But lightning does strike, and active shooter situations happen, and when they do the results are catastrophic. While organizations and law enforcement agencies have revamped their prevention and response strategies to address this critical issue, history shows that the immediate action of people on the scene is the most effective way to minimize or stop the violence.\" </p> <p>Still, the centre's information does appear to skirt the question of how a \"proactive mindset\" might have averted even a fraction of the carnage caused in almost any of these all-too-familiar tragedies that are almost invariably played out on the campuses of American states with <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18137414/\">notably lax gun ownership laws</a>. </p> <p>Earlier this decade, for instance, James Easton Kelly, a University of Arkansas graduate student, shot dead the English professor who oversaw his studies before turning the gun on himself.

  "<p>It seems far too often we see images on our television screens of the impact of the devastation caused by weapons, which have ended up in the wrong hands and fuelled dreadful human rights abuses. </p> <p>The carnage caused by sectarian violence in Iraq; the shocking image of a young boy carrying an AK-47, a gun almost the same height as himself; and the account of traumatised women and girls who have suffered horrific sexual abuse, often at the hands of perpetrators carrying weapons. </p> <p>Sadly it seems we have become so accustomed to seeing or hearing about these tragedies that it is easy for some of us to become immune. </p> <p>But we shouldn't. Most of the time, these dreadful acts are fuelled by the massive proliferation of weapons in the world, the majority of which are channelled to conflict-ridden zones. </p> <p>Every day about 1,000 people are killed by arms and with approximately 639m small arms on the planet, we're looking at around one gun for every 10 people. </p> <p>This is far from acceptable. Much greater international political will is needed to curtail this seemingly incessant flow of weapons. </p> <p>Last week David Miliband, the foreign secretary, said that it was \"bizarre\" that while there are international treaties and conventions for nuclear, chemical and biological weapons no such equivalent exists for weapons getting into conflict zones. </p> <p>It is indeed bizarre. In fact it's staggering to know that there exists no internationally-binding piece of legislation to control the transfer of weapons from one country or region to another.</p> <p>The arms trade is poorly regulated and irresponsible arms transfers are allowed to take place with little international scrutiny.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org.uk/uploads/documents/doc_18674.pdf\">Amnesty International's new report (pdf)</a> published today reveals how UN arms embargoes are regularly flouted as weapons are still reaching deadly conflict zones such as Darfur, DRC and Somalia.</p> <p>Amnesty found that, in 2006, the Sudanese government was able to import arms and ammunition worth $17.2m mainly from China but also from Iran and Egypt despite the government's armed forces carrying out serious human rights violations in the region of Darfur. </p> <p>And in the fragile state of Somalia, which has been blighted by conflict and where the general population has been subjected to widespread human rights abuses, Ethiopia and Eritrea have played a key role in supplying Somalia militia with arms. </p> <p>Ethiopia has imported heavy weapons such as tanks and other armoured vehicles mainly from Russia and China; and to a lesser degree from North Korea and the Czech Republic. </p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/17/armstrade.humanrights\">Iraq</a> there are about 360,000 weapons missing, primarily because of an unaccountable tracing process \u2013 a major failing on the part of the US department of defence, and potentially fuelling sectarian violence in the country.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the rest of the international community appears to be turning a blind eye to these flagrant embargo breaches. </p> <p>Perhaps even more concerning is that two of the principal exporters of weapons \u2013 which sometimes end up in the hands of rights abusers \u2013 are Russia and China, two permanent members of the UN security council. </p> <p>Next month, country leaders will gather at the UN to decide on whether or not to move forward with developing an international arms trade treaty \u2013 a internationally-agreed binding piece of legislation which would seek to tighten the international transfers of weapons to and from states where they are likely to inflict serious human rights abuses. </p> <p>In 2006, 153 states agreed to the proposal for such a treaty. Only the US voted against. This year, it is likely there will be a few member states which are likely to block, delay or water-down a resolution should any proposals to move the resolution be discussed. The main \"blockers\" are likely to be China, Russia, Pakistan, India and the US. </p> <p>The UK Government has promised to champion the need for an <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org.uk/content.asp?CategoryID=10079\">arms trade treaty</a>. It cannot afford to rest on its laurels at next month's meeting. It must instead, do all it can to ensure that a robust arms trade treaty is agreed upon: one with human rights at its centre. </p> <p>We cannot allow the unchecked trade in arms to continue. Tighter legislation governing this trade is long overdue. </p> <p>I for one don't want to see yet more images of the dreadful impact of weapons ending up in the hands of human rights abusers. It's time for members of the international community to properly regulate this trade, by acting decisively when they meet at the UN next month.</p>",
  "<p>The Malaysian prime minister today said he could relinquish power earlier than planned amid defections from his ruling coalition and opposition attempts to topple him.</p> <p>In a fresh setback for Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, another party announced it was leaving the coalition because of dissatisfaction with his leadership.</p> <p>The departure of the Sabah Progressive party, a small member of the 14-party National Front, reduced Badawi's majority to 56 seats.</p> <p>Officials said the party would remain independent for the time being but did not rule out joining the opposition leader, Anwar Ibrahim, in his People's Alliance and said Abdullah's coalition had \"lost its moral authority to rule\".</p> <p>\"I will not be staying [longer] than 2010 ... if I should want to go earlier, that is possible,\" Abdullah told a news conference. \"That is a flexibility that we have arranged.\"</p> <p>The prime minister - who had previously said he would resign in mid-2010 - confirmed he still intended to defend his post as the ruling party's leader in a December ballot.</p> <p>In an effort to ease some of the tensions over his leadership, he handed control of the finance ministry to his deputy, Najib Razak.</p> <p>Opponents have been demanding Abdullah's early resignation since he led the National Front to its worst election results in 51 years.</p> <p>It has been in power since Malaysia's independence from Britain in 1957, but lost its two-thirds parliamentary majority in March and conceded control of five of the country's 13 states to the People's Alliance.</p> <p>Anwar claimed to be on the verge of toppling the government, saying he had pledges of support from more than 31 National Front MPs ready to defect to the People's Alliance.</p> <p>Abdullah rejected the claim as a \"mirage\", accusing Anwar of causing public alarm and calling him \"a threat not only to our economy but possibly also ... security\".</p>",
  "<p>We've had blasphemous teddy bears and <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article4436051.ece\">sacrilegious frogs</a>, but this week a new religious animal quivered in the spotlight, as a Saudi cleric insisted that all <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/saudiarabia/2963744/Mickey-Mouse-must-die-says-Saudi-Arabian-cleric.html\">mice should be killed</a> \u2013 including Mickey Mouse. Sheikh Muhammad Munajid was seemingly unmoved by having the same initials as the cartoon character, and announced that under sharia law \"the mouse is a repulsive, corrupting creature\", before insisting that even its cartoon variants should die, giving a whole new meaning to the phrase \"taking the Mickey\".</p> <p>Munajid started his anti-rodent rant by deftly blending religion with food hygiene: \"If a mouse falls into a pot of food \u2013 if the food is solid, you should chuck out the mouse and the food touching it,\" he advised, \"and if it is liquid \u2013 you should chuck out the whole thing, because the mouse is impure\". Only fans of mouse-flavoured food would raise a squeak of protest.</p> <p>But Munajid then decided to sheikh things up further by lambasting mouse-based Western TV: \"How do you think children view mice today \u2013 after Tom and Jerry?\" he demanded sadly, explaining that the creatures \"have become wonderful and are loved by children\". By this logic, as well as teaching kids to love mice, Hanna-Barbera and Disney are also suggesting that rodents walk upright, wear clothes, speak English and are immortal.</p> <p>With the latter in mind, it's unclear how Munajid proposes to dispose of Mickey: perhaps by scribbling him out, or tearing him up, or maybe erasing him? The possibilities are only limited by the stocks at his nearest stationery store. But who does he think made mice in the first place?</p> <p>\"The mouse is one of satan's soldiers and is steered by him\", Munajid explained. Judging from the disorientated and hapless mice I've seen scuttling around, satan must be on one hell of a bender. Someone should tell him not to drink and drive.</p> <p>Munajid finished: \"Mickey Mouse has become an awesome character, even though according to Islamic law, Mickey Mouse should be killed in all cases\".</p> <p>Not being a Muslim, I wasn't sure how often Mickey Mouse was mentioned in Islamic law, so asked my Muslim friend <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/kiaabdullah\">Kia Abdullah</a>. \"He's being ridiculous\", she groaned. \"No doubt his words will be taken to reflect majority opinion, but he is presenting a warped idea of what Muslims believe.\"</p> <p>This isn't the first time attempts have been made to censor two-dimensional characters: in 2001, Saudi Arabia outlawed all forms of the game <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/mar/05/television.tvandradio1\">Pok\u00e9mon</a> for containing the star of David as one of its symbols, deciding that the Japanese cartoon was promoting Zionism. Qatar, Egypt and the UAE took its lead, and Pok\u00e9mon products are now banned in all four countries.</p> <p>But maybe this way of thinking should be encouraged rather than ridiculed. After all, if fundamentalists of every religion focused their attentions solely on symbolism and imagery, they'd leave moderates and non-believers to get on with their lives, give or take a few children's TV programmes. Saying \"you can't just ban things you don't like\" doesn't work, because Saudi Arabia can and will.</p> <p>So perhaps the sheikhs should keep up their relatively innocuous animation-killing, if it takes the pressure off three-dimensional human beings. They could denounce She-Ra (for showing too much thigh), Superman (for wearing his underpants on the outside) and Mumm-Ra (for daring to predict the future). If Munajid and his mates want to scatter mousetraps around outside Cartoon Network, picket performances of Of Mice And Men or join the Riyadh branch of Rentokil, that's just fine. Whatever makes them happy - as long as they don't do anything really honey-nut-loops like <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/7244579.stm\">trying women for witchcraft</a>, forbidding people from being gay, or stopping women from leaving the house alone without a <a href=\"http://www.humanrights-geneva.info/Saudi-Arabia-Male-guardianship,3039\">note from their Dad</a>. </p> <p>Oh no, hang on \u2026</p>",
  "<p>It is extraordinary, that in the middle of the most <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/creditcrunch\">devastating financial crisis</a> since the late 1920s, Labour should be struggling with the idea of whether or not to <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601085&amp;sid=auGnzEWdkgE4&amp;refer=europe\">change its leader</a>.</p> <p>Whatever the failings of Gordon Brown, the last thing needed now is some sort of contest for his threadbare mantle. </p> <p>It is not as though the conflict between Blairites and Brownites were a replay of wars between <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghibelline\">Guelphs and Ghibellines</a>, factions divided by irreconcilable loyalties to pope and emperor. Quite the contrary. These are personal animosities. If they were rooted in doctrinal differences, there might be some point to the present disorder, and the possibility of a resolution. Perhaps Labour is simply mirroring the turbulence of the global economic system, which, like events in the party, seem to have outrun the capacity of mere human beings to deal with them.</p> <p>Why Brown \u2013 the \"architect\" of the 10 good years \u2013 is being blamed for the ending of the recent long interval of prosperity is not clear. How could he have forestalled the sub-prime mortgage crisis, or the opaque \"financial innovations\" of investment banks, the mysterious world of derivatives, the selling-on of bundles of loans insured against failure, which are all now fast unwinding and revealing to the world once more what used to be called by archaic Leftists the \"true nature of capitalism\". </p> <p>The hounding of Brown is irrational and punitive; a bit like the ruinous banking system \u2013 non-performing loans meet a non-performing prime minister. But what could a new leader conceivably do? What miracles would he or (less likely) she have to perform? The electoral collapse of Labour merely mimics the demolition of the financial stability on which its fragile popularity was predicated. </p> <p>What we are seeing is not the recklessness of MPs, who feel the game is up and their seats already lost in an election already won by Cameron. We are witnessing a backlash against the enfeeblement of political power of those in what increasingly appears to be nominal governance, and their forfeit of the ability to intervene significantly in the affairs, not of the world, but even of our own country, buffeted as we are by the tempests of global confusion. It makes nonsense of Brown's alleged sagacious stewardship of \"our\" economy: it turns it isn't really ours at all, but a sort of outpost of somebody else's ill-managed imperium. </p> <p>No wonder Brown has been at pains to resuscitate a sense of Britishness \u2013 paradoxically also inspired by America, the source and origin of all our hopes and all our woes \u2013 with the union flag fluttering from the rooftops infants learning to lisp hymns to Britannia. This is a doomed heroic effort to reclaim territory irrecoverably lost, since it is clear we are at the mercy of forces over which we have no control at all. </p> <p>We owe the 10 years of prosperity and growing disposable income to the sleight of hand of the the conjurors of global financial markets, the boy-wizards of infantile omnipotence, the occultists of monetary illusion. Brown's eagerness to claim credit for that happy time stands in contrast with his desire to disclaim responsibility for the confusion for which his austere and joyless presence is \u2013 unjustly \u2013 now being blamed.</p> <p>The Labour party \u2013 of all political parties \u2013 ought to have been ready with some plausible account of what has happened. It ought to have had some narrative, some fable or story of why things are falling apart. Instead, we have to read the indecipherable script of financial journalists, whose language (apart that of a few experts in translation, like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/nov/22/comment.politics\">Larry Elliot</a>) is about as revealing as the destination of the securitised instruments in which bad loans were mysteriously whisked into outer darkness. </p> <p>The Labour party ought to have stepped in with a swift forensic analysis of what needs to be done to reverse the excesses of a deregulation over which they were only too happy preside. But New Labour merged with Old Capitalism, a union in which it became not so much a sleeping as a moribund partner. </p> <p>Labour, most people may have forgotten, owes its very existence to a critique of capitalism; a capacity it long ago forfeited when it decided to abrogate power in favour of the febrile unreason of markets. Labour voluntarily, of its own free will, submitted to the mutable wisdom of money and the short wit of wealth. No wonder it can do nothing but fall upon itself in impotent, fratricidal rage. Anger, once directed outwards, against injustice and exploitation, now has nowhere else to go. </p> <p>Even as workers are dismissed summarily from their jobs, their monthly salary cancelled, carrying in crates the contents of their cleared desks, the small paraphernalia of abridged permanent posts, Labour is struck uncharacteristically dumb. As other people anxiously await the next shake-out of labour, the next bank failure, the collapse of their holiday firms, the inflationary bite into the their small incomes, and the Liberal Democrats decide that they are the New Conservatives, Labour is powerless to provide the competent radical voice which the urgency of the hour requires. </p> <p>The madness of the markets seems to have entered the soul of New Labour, faced as it is with Old Capitalism, whose nature is far less changeable than that of its sometime enemies. </p> <p>If Labour cannot even tell a story any more, as Gisela Stuart says, this is because its tale has already been told. It is difficult not to see in the present convulsions of New Labour an acting out of the death-wish implicit in its abrogation of its quarrel with capitalism, a suicidal impulse given its final quietus when it called itself New, not so long ago, but in what now look like the old days.</p>",

Although the Lib Dem watchwords of \"fairness\" and \"social justice\" remain centre stage, Nick Clegg and Vince Cable have overseen a major shift in the party's traditional faith in high-tax, high-spend government solutions to the nation's ills.</p> <p>But if the party really does want to give power to the people, then what's been the recent track record of Lib Dem MPs in opposing the ever-greater reach of the nanny state?</p> <p>Yesterday, the new campaign group Liberal Vision published <a href=\"http://www.liberal-vision.org/store/Liberal%20Vision%20-%20How%20liberal%20are%20the%20Liberal%20Democrats.pdf\">research</a> (pdf) which aimed to find out. We looked at a range of recent votes on smoking, gambling and licensing of alcohol and a slew of early day motions \u2013 effectively petitions that MPs can sign, but with little chance of becoming law.</p> <p>MPs were given positive marks for acting in a liberal fashion and marked down for supporting measures that involved greater restrictions on personal choice. Maverick <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/lembitopik\">Lembit \u00d6pik</a> topped our table with a score of 55%, while Manchester MP John Leech was at the bottom with 22%. A large number of Lib Dem MPs had supported bans on the advertising of unhealthy foods, the elimination of all cigarette vending machines and investigations into the price of chocolate being sold in cinemas.</p> <p>These may seem like trivial issues to many people, but they matter for a vital electoral reason. At the last election, the Lib Dems ran on a 10-point plan of policy commitments, ranging from opposing ID cards to scrapping tuition fees, abolishing council tax and ending the Iraq war. Each individual pledge was pretty popular \u2013 but it was hard to see how they \"hung together\".</p> <p>Voters want to know what the Lib Dems' instincts are \u2013 not just be shown a detailed list of costings of the party's specific spending plans.</p> <p>With his triumph in the crunch conference vote on taxation on Monday, Clegg is building a compelling case about the need to shift power, money and influence away from politicians and bureaucrats and back towards ordinary men and women. But it's hard to make that story stick if Lib Dem MPs display a tendency to lecture the public about what they eat, drink and smoke. A message of getting government off people's backs could be enormously attractive to a large number of voters. But for it to be credible, a commitment to a smaller state needs to be applied across the board.</p>",
  "<p>\"<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2679388/Prostitutes-in-London-offer-sex-for-15.html\">Sex for \u00a315</a>\" and other such findings, including on the availability of unprotected sex, have made the headlines after the release of the <a href=\"http://www.eaves4women.co.uk/Publications.php\">Big Brothel report</a>, the culmination of the Poppy Project's research into off-street prostitution. Due to the fact that such \"findings\" have been reported out of context \u2013 for example, only in 2% of cases was unprotected sex on offer, as highlighted in Diane Taylor's brilliant article <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/08/ukcrime.gender\">Really lifting the lid? </a> \u2013 all this report has served to do is to paint a very bleak picture of the off-street sex scene which any socially-conscious individual would quite rightfully abhor. <br> There are many problems with the report, not least the fact that the research was conducted by male researchers posing as prospective clients. Given this, such findings as the average age of the women being 21 have to be taken with a large pinch of salt. It is not unheard of for women in their 30s to be \"advertised\" as being 21. At the very least, knocking five years off a woman's age is accepted as an industry standard; thus, adding five years to the woman's advertised age will give a more accurate picture. Furthermore, the report found that 75 different ethnicities were \"on offer\". I don't doubt this is true, but parlours have been known to try to pass off Thai women as Japanese, to give but one example. I would suggest that, knowing the industry as I do, the actual number of women of different ethnicities on offer is somewhat smaller.  Somewhat predictably, the Big Brothel report also slams the likes of the ITV2 series <a href=\"http://www.itv.com/Drama/contemporary/TheSecretDiaryofaCallGirl/default.html\">Secret Diary of a Call Girl</a> as depicting an unrealistic, glamorous off-street sex industry quite removed from the reality. But can a group of male researchers posing as clients, conducting telephone research and not even visiting the brothels in question, really claim to have uncovered the truth about \"what is going on\" in the industry? <br> I am an off-street sex worker. I don't live a Belle de Jour-type existence, but nor am I the trafficked/drug-addled/pimped victim the Big Brothel report would have you believe. The reality of my working life lies somewhere between the two. I feel obliged to state at this point that I have a good degree from a good university, as so many people assume we do this job because we are poor, uneducated souls. I say \"we\" because I am not alone \u2013 I know many, many women who work the length and breadth of the UK in the same way as I do. I cannot speak for all these women, of course, and I do not intend to try to do so, but suffice it to say that my situation is not an unusual one.  So, what is my situation? I am a single mother with two young children aged 4 and 6. Prior to doing this job \u2013 and it is a job \u2013 I was employed as a PA in a large, city-based firm. My job was a typical 9-to-5 \u2013 which, as everyone who has ever worked in such a job will know, means 7:30am to 6:30pm by the time you take into consideration travelling and (unpaid) overtime. I was dropping my children off at breakfast club at 8am and collecting them at 6pm, by which time we would all be completely knackered. The children go to bed at 7:30pm, meaning we were left with precisely 90 minutes to prepare and eat our evening meal, have baths, get ready for bed and read bedtime stories. It was like we were living in a whirlwind. I felt I never saw my kids \u2013 let's face it, I didn't (much) \u2013 there was certainly never much time for playing or talking or simply just sitting cuddling on the sofa. The guilt was getting to me. I was unhappy. I hoped they weren't, but I was never sure. Yet, despite the long hours I spent away from home, I was earning just enough to make ends meet. Sure I could pay the mortgage, but we'd never had a family holiday. By the time my monthly pay packet came around, I would have literally just a few pounds in the bank. It was by no means a desperate existence \u2013 we always had enough food, and the house was always heated \u2013 but it was quite empty from my point of view. My children are fantastic human beings and I wanted to spend more time in their company without us suffering financially, it was as simple as that. I wanted a job which would allow me to work flexible hours to fit around the children's schooling, fewer hours, but without taking the drop in wages which a part-time office job would have lead to. Escorting seemed like the natural solution. I say \"natural\" because it felt natural to me. I am well aware that this is not a job everybody could do. But as a sexually-aware and sexually-experienced woman in her mid-30s, the thought of having sex with strangers did not terrify me. I remember thinking that I might even enjoy it (and that has proved to be the case). I work from a flat on which I pay the mortgage \u2013 I do not have any landlord to worry about. I charge \u00a3150 per hour and I get enough enquiries to enable me to choose my own working hours. In a typical day I drop my children off at school at 9am, return home, shower and get changed into my alter-ego, Lara (we never use our own names). I then might have an hour's appointment at 11am and another at 1pm, leaving me with a break of an hour in between to shower and refresh myself. I then fetch myself a late lunch and am at the school again to collect my children at 3:30pm. It works. I never see more than two clients a day; most days I see only one; on other days none at all. Yet in just three hours' work I can earn the same as I used to earn in a week working at the office.  Such is the taboo of sex work, that it is difficult to tell anybody what I do for a living. These taboos are created and exacerbated by reports in the media of all prostitutes being drug addicts and \"dirty\". Promiscuity amongst women is still deemed to be something to be frowned upon. In order to make excuses for our behaviour (because excuses have to be made, of course \u2013 no \"normal\" woman would choose prostitution for a living) reports such as Big Brothel promote the victim status of prostitutes, making such sweeping generalisations such as \"if the women do not have pimps as such, their money will likely go to fund their coping strategies, such as drugs and alcohol\". I find such a statement both patronising and offensive. I do not have a pimp, and nor do I feel the need for \"coping strategies\". I am not au fait with drugs and drink only on social occasions. Contrary to what Big Brothel would have you believe, my money pays the mortgage and bills; it pays my income tax and national insurance; it buys food and clothing for my family and, this summer, it paid for the first holiday my children have ever known. My clients are on the whole middle-aged businessmen. I have never been treated with anything less than respect by any one of them. I have not been physically or sexually abused by any of them. Of course I have my security systems in place should anything go wrong, but so far nothing has. My children have their mother now, and not just on a part-time basis. I have time with them to enjoy their childhoods, without any of us suffering financially. I am not making big bucks \u2013 but I am earning a little more money to boot.  Big Brothel calls for the purchase of sex acts to be criminalised, in order to stem what it calls the \"rise in demand for prostitution\" which, it asserts, \"fuels trafficking\". The report does not seem to take into consideration that the type of people who benefit from trafficking, be it for prostitution or otherwise, are likely to pay scant regard to the law; as, indeed, are the men who wish to purchase sex from trafficked women. Criminalisation would only serve to drive the industry further underground, leaving the women who are victims of trafficking even more vulnerable.</p> <p>Conversely, making criminals of all men who pay for sex would result in myself and thousands of other women who choose to work in this industry becoming unemployed, and thus instead of contributing to the state (through our taxes) we would be taking from the state in the form of income support, housing benefit and so on. This is how we make a living; it's an industry that prevents many, many women and their children from living on the breadline. If you are going to take our livelihoods from us, the consequences will be devastating.</p>",
  "<p>This is the week of the great unravelling. It's only Wednesday but already we have seen the demise of America's fourth biggest investment bank, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/lehmanbrothers\">Lehman Brothers</a>, the swallowing of its third biggest investment bank, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/merrilllynch\">Merrill Lynch</a>, the nationalisation of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/17/aig.insurance.wallstreet\">US insurance giant AIG</a> and now moves to orchestrate the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/17/hbosbusiness.marketturmoil1\">takeover of HBOS by Lloyds TSB</a>.</p> <p>For many of us, this is a crisis that is coming worryingly close to home. HBOS is the owner of Halifax, which is responsible for \u00a31 in every \u00a35 saved in Britain and by far the country's biggest mortgage lender. This is a company that is clearly too big to fail, but looked close to it as its shares took another savage beating today.</p> <p>With their backs to the wall, the authorities are trying their best to manage a rapidly deteriorating situation. It would be naive to imagine that the Treasury, the Bank of England and the Financial Services Authority are fully in control, but the efforts since the weekend to orchestrate an orderly rescue for HBOS suggests that important lessons have been learned from the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/northernrock\">Northern Rock</a> fiasco a year ago. The biggest of those by far is that if you leave a rescue until the customers are clamouring to get their money out of the branches it is far, far too late.</p> <p>Clearly, if Lloyds TSB does swallow up HBOS it will drive a coach and horses through competition policy, since the number of high street banks would shrink from five to four. But in the grand sweep of things, such concerns are currently irrelevant. We are talking here, after all, about the implosion of Britain's financial sector, the shaky platform on which the economy has relied this past decade or more.</p> <p>The government knows that it has to save HBOS and it may have to provide sweeteners to ensure a deal happens. Should the Lloyds TSB takeover fail, there will probably be an attempt to find another private sector buyer - probably HSBC. After that, the only option would be nationalisation.</p> <p>This is all happening amid signs that the economy is heading rapidly into a deep and long recession. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/17/unemploymentdata.recession\">Today's unemployment figures</a> were bad but by no means a surprise. The jobless total has been heading higher all year, and following the same sort of deteriorating pattern as was seen in the shake-outs of both the early 1980s and the early 1990s. Redundancies have been concentrated in the sectors of the economy which showed the strongest growth during the boom - finance, construction and retailing. Further big increases in unemployment are inevitable over the winter even if the do-nothing Bank of England eventually works out that a slump is a far greater threat to the economy than inflation.</p> <p>With banks going down like ninepins, it is somewhat curious that the Bank of England believes that the risks to the economy are evenly balanced. It must be on a different planet from the rest of us.</p>",
  "<p>Manchester United insist it is 'business as usual' at Old Trafford despite the near collapse of major sponsors AIG.

  "<p>When the New York socialite Leona Helmsley died just over a year ago, every <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1560839/Leona-Helmsley.html\">obituary</a> recalled her most famous aphorism \"only little people pay taxes\". Although the convicted felon denied ever saying those words, they ring true when you consider how large firms only hand over a pittance in return for pilfering much of the world's resources.</p> <p>Take the case of Zambia. In 2006, copper production from the country was worth about \u00a32bn, yet the Lusaka government took in a meagre \u00a312m in tax revenues from companies extracting this metal.</p> <p>While the super-rich can stash away their profits in unregulated bank accounts, the little people of the planet are frequently condemned to misery and premature death. The United Nations has estimated that capital flight from poor countries can exceed $600bn per year, over six times what they receive in development aid. </p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.taxjustice.net/cms/upload/pdf/Africa_0808_tax_communique.pdf\">conference (pdf)</a> of tax commissioners in Pretoria last month conference concluded that the total volume of \"hot money\" that left Africa between 1991 and 2004 was the equivalent of nearly 8% of the continent's income. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.christianaid.org.uk\">Christian Aid</a> has calculated that the loss to healthcare systems caused by tax evasion has resulted in about 3 million infants dying unnecessarily so far this decade. </p> <p>European Union governments should not be allowed escape their responsibility for this grotesque level of suffering. Several of the world's most notorious tax havens are either within the EU or on the dependent territory of its member states.

Like many of the promises made at such gatherings, the pledge has been broken. But when Germany used its leadership of the G8 last year to <a href=\"http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,2580513,00.html\">urge</a> greater transparency over hedge funds, Britain and the US rejected its appeal.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.un.org/esa/ffd/documents/SGreport_25JUL2008.pdf\">follow-up</a> to the Monterrey conference will kick off in Doha, Qatar this November.

These groups have successfully mobilised the public and politicians on debt relief and aid in the past, so I don't see why they cannot do the same on an issue that is arguably more emotive.

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/baa\">The airports operator BAA</a> today put Gatwick up for sale, paving the way for a politically charged auction by admitting it expects interest from state-backed investors.</p> <p>Colin Matthews, the chief executive of Britain's largest airport operator, said sovereign wealth funds had emerged as powerful financial players as the credit crisis cramped financing options for private equity and infrastructure fund bidders.</p> <p>\"Every observer of the market knows where the money is, and I am sure that sovereign wealth funds would be one of the groups interested,\" Matthews said. </p> <p>Some of the wealthiest and most active funds, including Abu Dhabi Investment Capital, the Investment Corporation of Dubai and the Kuwait Investment Authority, are based in the Middle East.</p> <p>Manchester Airport Group and Virgin Atlantic, both of which have confirmed an interest in Gatwick, have reportedly sounded out sovereign wealth funds over backing a bid.</p> <p>MPs have already warned that BAA's ownership by a non-UK business - Ferrovial, of Spain - is against the national interest. </p> <p>The late Gwyneth Dunwoody, a former chair of the transport select committee, said last year that selling BAA to a foreign business was a mistake that had contributed to a fall in service standards. </p> <p>\"Until we decide, as a nation, to do something about this, it will continue to be the case that decisions of national strategic importance will be taken in the interest of a company based in Madrid and not in the national interest,\" she said.</p> <p>Louise Ellman MP, the Labour chair of the transport select committee, told theguardian.com that selling to a Middle East investor would raise \"concerns\". </p> <p>\"This all seems to be a bit rushed. I think there would be a concern if there was a rush and a Middle Eastern interest bought Gatwick to the exclusion of a local business ... In the current international situation there would be concerns about a middle eastern interest having control over major transport and aviation infrastructure.\"</p> <p>Matthews said the continuing inquiry into BAA by the competition commission was a \"big chunk of the motivation\" in putting Gatwick up for sale. </p> <p>In a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/20/baa.theairlineindustry\">provisional report</a>, published last month, the commission said selling two of BAA's three London airports and one of its Scottish airports could improve services for both airlines and passengers. </p> <p>\"There is no point in waiting for another announcement,\" said Matthews.</p> <p>Matthews admitted that public pressure had contributed to the decision to sell. \"A sense from BAA that we are blindly defending the status quo is not a smart way to deal with that,\" he said. \"BAA is not refusing to listen to a widespread public conviction that it is time for a change.\"</p> <p>EasyJet, Gatwick's largest airline, said a sale would not lead to a fall in excessive landing fees at the airport because the business would remain a local monopoly.</p> <p>Michael O'Leary, the chief executive of Ryanair, accused BAA of attempting to dissuade the competition commission from demanding a fundamental break-up by selling off Gatwick. \"Airlines and passengers have been abused for many years with high prices and abysmal service at all of the BAA's London and Scottish airports ... the trick of selling off Gatwick won't end this abusive monopoly,\" he said. </p> <p>Matthews said the airport operator would continue to argue against selling Stansted and one of its Scottish airports, despite the commission indicating that further sales would probably be ordered. </p> <p>He said the expansion of Stansted should be overseen by BAA, which had the financial power to alleviate capacity problems at UK airports by building new runways both there and at Heathrow.</p> <p>\"Reasonable observers would recognise that capacity is more important than the question of ownership,\" he said. \"Any steps that we take today which get in the way of delivering needed capacity would be a pity.\"</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Preamble</strong> Good evening everyone. The bookies reckon this will be a United romp [no references to bawdy tabloid tales here please] and make them 1-2 favourites tonight, but I'm not so sure. Villarreal finished second in La Liga last season, have strengthened in the summer, and are up against an experimental-looking United side that features Jonny Evans alongside Rio Ferdinand at the back and a midfield of Owen Hargreaves, Darren Fletcher, Park Ji Sung and Nani. Cristiano Ronaldo starts on the bench.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Man Utd:</strong> Van der Sar, Neville, Ferdinand, Evans, Evra, Nani,<br>Hargreaves, Fletcher, Park, Rooney, Tevez. <strong>Subs:</strong> Foster, Brown, Ronaldo, Anderson, Giggs, Vidic, O'Shea.</p> <p><strong>Villarreal:</strong> Diego Lopez, Angel, Rodriguez, Godin, Capdevila, Cani, Eguren, Edmilson, Pires, Fernandez, Franco. <strong>Subs:</strong> Viera, Santi Cazorla, Ibagaza, Llorente, Javi Venta, Senna, Fuentes.</p> <p><strong>Referee:</strong> Wolfgang Stark (Germany)</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>Meanwhile to your emails ... </strong> Dave \"a Manc stuck deep in Arsenal territory\" wants to know \"Does anyone know of pub in near Dalston that might show the United match - and where I won't get stabbed?\" Meanwhile Tony Richards claims that Darren Fletcher is the \"most underrated player in Europe\", before adding \"I bet your readers can't think of anyone better who is less appreciated\". Well?</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>1 min</strong> We're off! Old Trafford doesn't look full but it's certainly boisterous. Gary Neville is also up for it too: he's so focused in the tunnel he even tries to out-stare the TV cameras. <em>And succeeds</em>.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>2 min</strong> After barely two minutes, Pires gets first reducer from Owen Hargreaves. He gets up very gingerly indeed, like a wounded wildebeast. It's been a decent start, with Villarreal keeping the ball nicely.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>4 min</strong> Nice work from Nani on the left ends with a cross that Godin clears with a flying Superman header.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>5 min</strong> Meanwhile this from Jon Cummins. \"Nice to see Fergie still has his ruthless streak,\" he writes. \"Pretty much everyone who played a stinker at Anfield (besides Van Der Sar) is dropped or unavailable. I wonder if Scholes wasn't suspended if he'd get a game tonight?\" Not sure if he's been ruthless or pragmatic, Jon. United travel to Stamford Bridge on Sunday and I'm sure he wants to trial Evans and rest some of his players. Intriguingly Villarreal haven't named their best side either. Anyone would think the opening stages of the Champions League don't really matter. (What? Eh? Etc, etc).</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>7 min</strong> The singing continues and so does United's pressure. Nani wriggles inside before his cross goes off for a corner ...</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>9 min</strong> ... Rooney's back-post cross is flapped at by the Villarreal keeper (who comes, then stops, then stands still) before landing on Ferdinand's unmarked foot five yards out. It hits his heel, rolls across goal, and Villarreal clear.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>11 min</strong> Meanwhile Andrew Ross has suggestions for not-that-scary Dalston pubs. \"The Yucatan on Kingsland Road/Stoke Newington High Street will have the United and Celtic games on. Check out the garden furniture inside the bar and roguish Irish punters.\" Roguish Irish punters?! Bit of a generalisation that, Andrew.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>13 min</strong> The game has already settled into a predictable pattern: United attacking, Villarreal defending with a 9-0-1 formation. Nani tries a swirler from 30 yards that Lopez fails to handle but no one is following up.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>15 min</strong> It's all United so far. \"Can anyone enlighten me as to where in God's green hell is the \u00a330.2m or whatever Lord Ferg paid to Tottenham for Dimitar Berbatov?\" asks Rodrigo Moya. He's got a knee injury and is watching the game from the stands is the prosaic answer, Rodrigo.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>17 min</strong> Early goals so far tonight: Lyon 0-1 Fiorentina, Steaua 0-1 Bayern Munich.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>18 min</strong> Superb turn by Tevez, who is then grabbed with both hands by Rodriguez and wrestled to the ground. Not unreasonably Tevez asks for a yellow card but the referee Wolfgang Stark, a banker by trade, isn't having it.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>19 min</strong> Nani wins a highly dubious free-kick on the edge of the Villarreal area after tripping over his own shoelaces but, like 19,831 divided by zero, it comes to nothing.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>22 min</strong> Rooney's 35-yarder smashes into a Villarreal defender. \"Did you make a mint on Cluj last night and what are your top tips for tonight's matches,\" asks George Templeton. I didn't George, but my colleague Barry Glendenning had the princely sum of \u00a38 at 12.5-1 on Cluj and won \u00a3100. Have backed under 1.5 goals tonight at 5-2, and laid Manchester United at 1.52, but it's still early days.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>24 min</strong> So close for United! Nani plays it to Fletcher, who dinks it back to Nani, who feathers it to Fletcher, who slips in Park, whose shot is deflected just wide. The resulting corner comes to nothing.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>26 min</strong> United are dominating this. \"Fletcher may well may be the most under-appreciated player in Europe if he wasn't playing for Manchester United,\" says Jon Cummins. \"Let Tony Jarvis know, however, that he is without question the worst set-piece marker in Europe, I've seen him burned far too many times for Scotland and United in the last year.\"</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>28 min</strong> [Minute-by-minute reporter dons anorak] United shots: six. Villarreal shots: zero.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>29 min</strong> Nani, who is having one of his better games for United, plays in Evra but his cross is blocked. Villarreal immediately counterattack and Pires' shot from the most acute of angles is easily saved by Van Der Sar.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>31 min</strong> Tevez gets his foot on the ball, looks up, and then hits a fizzer from 30 yards which is heading for the top corner until Diego Lopez palms round the post.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>33 min</strong> More United pressure. This time Rooney's cross is met by Fletcher's head on the penalty spot ... and a Villarreal defender soon afterwards.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>34 min</strong> \"Can I join the 1,056 other pedants in pointing out that if you divide by zero (19 min) you get infinity, which would be a pretty good result for tripping up,\" says Robin Hazlehurst. \"I suppose that if you divide by infinity you must get zero, but it's a long time since I did maths and it's too late at night to think that deeply, so it might not be so.\"</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>35 min</strong> Yellow card Franco for a two-footed sliding lunge at Evra.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>36 min</strong> So close again! Nani's cross evades both Rooney, Ferdinand, Diego Lopez in the Villarreal goal and the back post. United plead for a corner, but the referee - wrongly as it took a deflection - gives a goal-kick.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>38 min</strong> More excellent jinkin' and dribblin' from Nani, who makes 10, 15, maybe 20 yards before playing in Park, who takes a touch before appearing to be tripped by Capdevila. He appeals loudly for a penalty but the referee says goal kick. United players are not happy at all.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>40 min</strong> Yet another half-chance for United: this time Tevez drags a shot wide from 15 yards.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>42 min</strong> \"I'd just like to reiterate that the Yucatan on Stokie High St will definitely be showing United in the back room and Arsenal in the front room,\" says Neill Staniforth. \"It's great. On Saturdays you can also watch some Premier League games too via satellite. And in the summer they lay on a free bbq! Awesome.\" Awesome?! This isn't the Sydney Morning Herald, Neill.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>44 min</strong> Cani Stams it 40 yards over the bar. \"Let's just move the conversation completely away from football and into the classroom for a moment,\" says Andrew Dean, adjusting his thick NHS spectacles. \"No, Robin (34th min) you do not get infinity when dividing by zero, you get a null-set, the calculation can't be made. Zero does not go into any number an infinite amount of times \u2026 that would imply that multiplying infinity by zero would get you some other number(s) instead of the zero that we all know is the result of multiplying a number by zero.\" So now you know.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>45 min</strong> For the first time all half. Villarreal actually get their foot on the ball for a good 30 seconds. But they continue to show as much penetration as a wooden knife trying to puncture an armour-plated tank and United clear.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>46 min</strong> We're off again. \"Despite a shock result or two last night, these Champions League Group matches are a bit of a waste of time aren't they?\" sighs Gary Naylor. \"Why don't they just look at the wage bills of the teams that qualified and put the top 16 payers into the CL knockout stage and the rest into the Uefa Cup?\" Better still, Gary, why not make the Champions League a 64-team knockout?</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>47 min</strong> No substitutes at half-time by the way. Meanwhile more arguing about my maths (math for American readers). \"I hope you haven't put any money on anything tonight, because if you think '19,831 divided by zero is nothing' you're likely to come a cropper - 19,831 divided by zero is in fact 19,831,\" insists Neill Staniforth. Are you sure Neill? Really?</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>49 min</strong> Van Der Sar's 80-yard thump down the pitch just evades Rooney on the left and skids off the turf for a throw in. Villarreal still have nine behind the ball pretty much all of the time, but they're actually been in United's half three times already this half. A statement of intent?</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>52 min</strong> Nani's up-and-under is well taken by Lopez. Meanwhile more maths talk. \"I know I am being pedantic, but division by zero is not defined,\" says Jan Schreuder. \"The limit of the division of a positive number by x while x is getting arbitrarily close to 0 is infinity. Sorry.\"</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>54 min</strong> The biggest cheer of the night at Old Trafford comes as Ronaldo begins his warm-up. It's amazing how a poor start to the season can change the attitude of the average United fan, isn't it?</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>55 min</strong> Villarreal are slowly altering their ambitions from all-out-defence to we-might-just-be-able-to-nick-something-here. They're certainly having more possession this half, without actually doing much with it.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>57 min</strong> Park's meek shot rolls apologetically wide. \"Anyone else notice that United now has a new sponsor?\" chuckles Bobby Otter. \"The US Government! So many jokes, so little time.\" Well, you've got 33 minutes, Bobby ...</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>59 min</strong> Ronaldo is getting ready to come on ... and the United fans are singing lusty songs in praise of him.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>60 min</strong> Villarreal hit the post! After a superb series of passes, Pires' cross was back-flicked past Van Der Sar by Franco. It hits the post and rolls back into the United keeper's arms.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>62 min</strong> United subs: Ronaldo for Park, Anderson for Hargreaves.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>63 min</strong> Meanwhile more dork talk. \"As Andrew Dean comments, multiplying by zeros and infinities is not straightforward,' says Carlos Chiquete from the Applied Mathematics program at the University of Arizona. \"I will add to the confusion and say that infinity is not a number per se, it exists outside of the set of numbers. As such, multiplying by infinity is not allowed. However one can have sequences of numbers that have the respective limits zero and infinity, from which one can calculate a finite result for the limit of the product thereby in a sense get that infinity times zero is 1 or whatever one likes.\" I'm out of my depth here, aren't I?</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>66 min</strong> Anderson slaloms down the right, chips it to Ronaldo, whose shot hits the ground and loops into Lopez's arms. Moments later, Tevez's cross is pushed out by Lopez a la Arcanada during Spain v Northern Ireland in Espana 82 but Anderson thrashes a 20-yard shot miles over.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>67 min</strong> Villarreal sub: Pires, who has played OK but nothing more, off - Ibagaza on.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>69 min</strong> Another long-range Anderson shot goes well wide. \"When United play Newcastle, it'll be AIG vs Northern Rock,\" points out Gary Naylor. \"Surely the US and UK governments have more pressing commitments than financing the salaries of Joey Barton and Wayne Rooney?\"</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>71 min</strong> Villarreal are like the kid who is scared to go into the deep end of the swimming pool for years but then get a dangerous taste for it. They're attacking perhaps a bit too much here - and Lopez again has to be smart to fist a Nani cross clear.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>73 min</strong> Superb from United! Ronaldo skips down the left, plays in Rooney who slides it across the area where Tevez is lurking. His shot is partly smothered by the keeper allowing Rodriguez to make a brilliant off-the-line clearance.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>74 min</strong> Yellow card for Tevez for a nasty barge on Diego. Meanwhile the number of readers suggesting Neill Staniforth (47 min) needs to do remedial/infant school maths: 17.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>76 min</strong> It's all got a bit scrappy, but Villarreal have just had six players in the United half so they definitely think they can get something here.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>77 min</strong> Villarreal sub: Franco off, Llorente.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>78 min</strong> Another United free-kick from halfway inside the Villarreal half; another agricultural defensive clearance from the Spanish side.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>79 min</strong> Ronaldo has switched the right-hand side but he's not getting any joy. Meanwhile this from Gary Naylor: \"With AIG being a agency of the US Government, should Sarah Palin find herself a heartbeat from the Presidency, will she threaten war on Zenit St Petersburg in a pre-emptive strike against the possibility of the Russians repeating their Super Cup success in the CL knockout phase. It's time America stopped being pushed around after all!\" Don't joke Gary. It may happen.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>80 min</strong> Great chance from Ronaldo - again Nani does well to work an angle, before sending over a backpost cross. Ronaldo is free, about seven yards out, but his header slides wide. He should have done better.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>81 min</strong> United shots on goal: 18. Villarreal shots on goal: four.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>82 min</strong> United sub: Tevez off, Giggs on. Ronaldo then sends a skidding cross which evades everyone, takes a bounce, hits Jonny Evans' head ... and hits the post! So close for United!</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>84 min</strong> They've just shown the replay of Evans' chance. He was unmarked, six yards out, just wide of the far post and really should have scored. \"Does Neill Staniforth (47 min) by any chance work in the accounts department at AIG?\" asks Marie Meyer.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>86 min</strong> United are really going for it now - can they get a winner? Meanwhile this from Justin Kavanagh. \"Are all these numbers geeks infinitizing on today's MBM the same people who were running, sorry, ruining the world's economies up to the start of this week, perchance?\"</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>86 min</strong> Llorente goes for glory from 40 yards, and finds the back of row ZZ.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>88 min</strong> United are beginning to resort to page one of the Charles Hughes' book of football here [ie hump it forward as quickly as possible] but it's a tactic that's being easily dealt with by the Villarreal centre-backs.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>89 min</strong> Yellow card Ibagaza for - I think - arguing with the referee. Nani goes to ground, appealing for a free-kick, but the referee waves his pleas away.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>90 min</strong> We'll have three minutes of added time.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>91 min</strong> Yellow card for Diego Lopez for timewasting. Meanwhile Kevin Mannerings asks: \"Does anyone in Stoke Newington know what happened to Moris Milk Bar, a wonderful kosher Milk Bar where I worked for a week around Easter for a few years making kosher biscuits about 30 years ago? Moris was a wonderful guy to work for, as a young boy he survived<br>Auschwitz. The biscuits and other food he made, like fish cakes were<br>really delicious.\" Anyone?</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>92 min</strong>Ronaldo, who has looked fit but not match-sharp, tries his luck down the left but over-runs the ball and Villarreal get a goal-kick. Last chance for United ...</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>Full-time</strong> Peep! Peep! Villarreal have the draw they came for, and probably just about deserved. Meanwhile the final word on what 19,831 divided by zero is goes to Nicholas Einhorn, who writes: \"I've tried to stay out of this, but now I feel compelled to say that 19,831 divided by zero is undefined in any field (such as the real numbers), but may be defined in other structures (such as the real projective line). Sorry.\" Don't ask me what it means: I only took GCSE Maths. Anyway, I'm off to count my winnings. Thanks for all your many emails, sorry I couldn't use them all. Best, Sean.</p>",
  "<p>Check this one out quickly if you're interested, because it's likely to disappear once the people from Fox get round to nixing the source video. This is an extended clip-cum-trailer for the forthcoming big budget science fiction remake, which hits cinema screens here on December 12, and is presumably going to be aimed at filling the festive sci-fi blockbuster slot which I Am Legend sat in last year.</p> <p>Keanu Reeves plays alien Klaatu, who in the classic 1951 original arrives on Earth in human form to deliver a warning about our descent into violence and conflict. The old Klaatu was a pretty peaceable fellow who relied on robot pal Gort for defence. Reeves' version, perhaps inevitably, looks rather more belligerent.</p> <p>If nothing else, perhaps the new film will alert new fans to the bravura original (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjHziasA7s8\">check out a wonderful clip here</a>), which the great Arthur C Clarke ranked seventh on his list of the best science fiction films of all time, just above Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, despite Clarke himself having written the screenplay for the latter. Clarke wrote about similarly principled yet austere alien overlords in his 1953 novel Childhood's End.</p> <p>I'm very much hoping this new version will live up to its predecessor's brilliance, but one line from the clip (<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2008/aug/18/daytheearthstoodstill.keanureeves\">which my colleague Anna Pickard has already bemoaned</a>) leaves me worrying that the producers have some horrific Hancock-style twist planned. It's delivered by Reeves' Klaatu to Jennifer Connelly's alien expert scientist:</p> <p>\"If the earth dies, you die ... if you die, the earth survives.\"</p> <p>Hollywood will keep remaking these classic films whether we wish them to or not, so perhaps all we can do, like the gathered hordes waiting for something to emerge from the flying saucer in the original, is hope for the best.

  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> London.<br> <strong>The lineup:</strong> Peter Conway (vocals, guitar).</p> <p><strong>The background:</strong> Coolly unshaven and with couldn't-care-less hair, Peter Conway certainly looks the sexily dishevelled part. Not sure about his music, though. He's a white bluesman born in west London but whose spiritual home is a back porch somewhere in rural, 1920s America. He's a singer-songwriter with a deep, gruff, growly rumble of a voice designed - term used deliberately - to express the blues, to sing songs of sorrow and suffering, of roads travelled and hopes dashed.</p> <p>\"Designed\", because it's one of those really \"expressive\" voices that aims for authenticity but actually ends up sounding almost ludicrously mannered. You can imagine Conway believes he's tapping right into the source of the blues, as though he's the son and heir of Blind Lemon Conserve and all those Delta bluesmen, but more than anything his voice recalls white soul belter Eric Burdon, Paul Weller circa Wild Wood or even Chris Rea. <br> It's a voice that is a cliched signifier of trouble and pain, just as the lyrics to some of Conway's songs trot out hackneyed notions of rebellion, of abstention from boring mainstream society, and of sticking it to The Man. On Talk About Time, he bellows, \"I've had enough of working nine to five\", like it's the most radical thought that ever occurred, like he's the epitome of dark, brooding intensity and he's just not gonna take it any more. He's got songs called Long Road, and Chains (the latter a simulacrum of mid-1970s Al Green), and one called Bring Me that goes, \"Bring me a government that's sane, a world without suffering or pain / Bring me the fortitude of mind, a love that is not blind\". Sure, no problem, will do. His acoustic version of Ne-Yo's Closer is a typical gesture of a musician clinging to the notion of authenticity - he's rescued the bare bones of the song, removed all that artificial modern-dance armature and synthetic production, exposing the lyric and melody in all their stark predictability. It's a common conceit: that contemporary R&amp;B would be great if not for all that pesky studio trickery, missing the point entirely - the production, the technical flash and shiny surfaces, aren't barriers to communication of the song's essence, they're exactly what make it great.</p> <p>Still, if you like stripped-down blues-rock, if you thought Weller betrayed his working-class roots with the fancy, fussy Style Council and only revealed his true inner geezer when he picked up an acoustic guitar and sang throatily over crudely simple three-chord, 12-bar ballads, Conway's your man. He's got some quirky attributes that might appeal. For example, he apparently has a thing about performing near (or under) trees, he was discovered by Decca Records while serenading his future manager's wife under something lush and arboreal in Kilburn, and he wrote around 14 songs under another one in Regents Park during a frenetic fortnight of activity. It must have been quite a tree.</p> <p><strong>The buzz:</strong> \"I can't think of many artists - apart from, perhaps, Leonard Cohen - who encompass such divergent emotions and thought processes.\" <br> <strong>The truth:</strong> If this is your bag, you'll possibly find something quite appealing about Conway and his quaint defection from the modern world. <br> <strong>Most likely to:</strong> Become a tree surgeon or landscape gardener. <br> <strong>Least likely to:</strong> Become a hi-tech soundscaper. <br> <strong>What to buy:</strong> The single Breakthrough is released by Decca Records on September 29. The album of the same name is released in February 2009. <br> <strong>File next to:</strong> Paul Weller, Chris Rea, Tom Waits, Eric Burdon.</p> <p><strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/peterconwaymusic\">MySpace.com/peterconwaymusic</a></p> <p><strong>Tomorrow's new band:</strong> Fenech-Soler.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Why is HBOS in trouble?</strong></p> <p>Investor concern centres on HBOS's reliance on the money markets to raise funds to finance its business. Because of the credit crunch, banks are finding it increasingly hard to raise money this way. In addition to funding issues and its exposure to the mortgage market, there are questions about HBOS's strategy towards corporate customers, a business it has expanded rapidly since the merger between Halifax and Bank of Scotland created the bank seven years ago. The merger allowed the vast deposits accumulated by Halifax to help fuel Bank of Scotland's corporate banking operations.</p> <p><strong>What does HBOS say?</strong></p> <p>The assault on its share price forced HBOS to say that it had a \"strong capital base\" \u2013 enough money - to weather the storm. In July, HBOS raised \u00a34bn in a rights issue as a cushion in preparation for what it thought would be up to four years of market turbulence. But <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jul/22/hbosbusiness.banking\">the cash call was an embarrassment for the country's biggest mortgage lender</a> as investors shunned the new shares. Dresdner Kleinwort and Morgan Stanley, the two City banks that guaranteed HBOS the funds in return for fees of about \u00a390m, were forced to sell \u00a33.8bn of unwanted shares on the stock market. </p> <p><strong>What role have speculators played in HBOS's plight?</strong></p> <p>HBOS has been the target of speculators betting on a possible collapse of the group. In March, the Financial Services Authority (FSA) announced an investigation of rumours by short-sellers that drove down the company's share price by 17% on a single day . The regulator subsequently admitted that it had not uncovered evidence that the rumours were spread by traders seeking to profit from manipulating the share price, but it warned traders of criminal action in other instances. In the latest crisis, Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, called on the FSA to intervene to stop short-selling of bank shares by hedge funds. \"Speculation is a normal part of trading in shares,\" he said. \"But on this occasion the hedge funds are betting against the taxpayer, since they know that if a leading British bank were to collapse, the government would have no alternative but to intervene.\"</p> <p><strong>What are the prospects of HBOS collapsing?</strong></p> <p>HBOS is too important for the government to allow it to go under. The knock-on effects of such a collapse could be seismic, undermining confidence in the rest of the banking sector. Think Northern Rock on a much bigger scale. Just as the US government stepped in to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/17/marketturmoil.creditcrunch\">rescue AIG, the insurance giant,</a> because of the implications for the financial system, so the same applies to HBOS. As well as lending money for homes, HBOS provides loans for big businesses and private equity deals. The bank says it has a large pool of deposits - \u00a3280bn - from savers and holds \u00a31 in every \u00a35 saved in Britain to make it the UK's biggest deposit-taker. Most of its funding - 52% - comes from these deposits but this is less than its major rivals.</p> <p><strong>What moves are afoot to help HBOS?</strong></p> <p>HBOS is understood to have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/17/hbosbusiness.marketturmoil1\">approached Lloyds TSB over a possible merger</a> and the reports have helped to halt the collapse in HBOS shares. It is likely that the authorities were pulling many strings in the background and that the highest levels of government were also fully informed about the plans being made to ensure HBOS survived. But a deal is by no means assured with Lloyds TSB, which already owns mortgage lender Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester.</p> <p><strong>Would a merger be good news for customers?</strong></p> <p>It would be better than the loss of the bank, which could leave some savers out of pocket. Only the first \u00a335,000 of your savings are protected if a bank collapses, and at HBOS that applies to total holdings across the group. A saver with accounts at Birmingham Midshires and Halifax, for example, could stand to lose money if the bank does fail. However, a merger will mean less competition in the mortgage, current account and savings markets, which will be bad news for consumers. With Alliance &amp; Leicester already set to merge with Abbey and the disappearance of some small building societies in recent weeks, customers are going to end up with less choice of providers.</p> <p><strong>What will happen to HBOS shareholders in the event of a deal?</strong></p> <p>They will have to approve the deal before it goes through. The deal with Lloyds could value each share at 200p which would be good news for shareholders who have seen the value of their holdings plummet in recent months. HBOS has more than 2 million private shareholders, many of them customers who received shares when Halifax demutualised from a building society to a bank in 1997. At the time, the shares were worth 774p each, but at one stage this morning they had dropped to just 88p. </p> <p><strong>Which brands are part of HBOS?</strong></p> <p>The group offers mortgages, savings and investments across a wide range of brands, so some customers may not even realise they are with the bank. The main Halifax and Bank of Scotland brands offer a full range of banking services, from current accounts to mortgages. The web-based Intelligent Finance offers offset mortgages and savings; Clerical Medical provides pensions and investments; Insight Investments offers funds; Birmingham Midshires offers savings and mortgages.</p> <p><strong>What will this mean for the property market?</strong></p> <p>HBOS's problems are not good news for the property market which has already almost ground to a halt. The bank is the UK's biggest mortgage lender and recently reasserted its commitment to helping first-time buyers into the market. If Lloyds does take over it could scale back lending, making it even harder for would-be buyers to raise funds. Falling demand for properties has already pushed house prices down by more than 10% over the past year, according to Halifax's own measure, and a lack of mortgages could lead to further falls. </p> <p><strong>What happens to my mortgage?</strong></p> <p>Whether your home loan is with HBOS or Lloyds TSB, it should be business as usual. You will need to continue repaying your mortgage each month at the agreed rate. Even if a lender did collapse, you would not get out of repaying a debt \u2013 another organisation would buy up the mortgage book and collect your money each month.</p>",
  "<p>So I was abed this morning listening to NPR and on comes Mara Liasson with a report about the women's vote. Typical silly evenhandedness, and then she plays a snippet from a McCain-Palin radio commercial that sums up the whole problem, really.</p> <p>The commercial is about the \"sexist\" attacks on Palin. The script is read of course in a woman's voice, and she conveys just the right tone of anger and contempt for the sneering hypocritical liberal elite misogynists. They tried A, and B, and C, the woman says. And then, when that didn't work, \"they called her a liar.\" She brands this \"despicable.\"</p> <p>Okay. I spent yesterday afternoon fretting that Obama's message was too muddled, not pointed enough. Almost everyone I know thinks this. Maybe we're right. Or maybe we're just compulsive fretters, because that's what liberals tend to be based on experience.</p> <p>So maybe the Obama team is flailing. But now I hear this ad and I think, how do you fight an opponent that not only lies, but then tells lies about the lies?</p> <p> </p> <p>Palin is a liar. Of this there's no question. She supported the bridge to nowhere. She asked for earmarks as governor \u2013 and not just one or two, but $453 million worth. She still goes around the country saying the exact opposite of both of these things. To adoring supporters, natch, who care nothing about what the truth of the matter is, only that she's sticking it to the liberal-elite man.</p> <p>Eugene Robinson <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/15/AR2008091502471.html\">summed this up nicely yesterday</a> in his Wash Post column. Palin, he explained, did sort of 'fess up about the bridge in her Charlie Gibson interview. But a few days later, she was back out on the trail saying the same thing.</p> <p>Robinson:</p> <blockquote> <p>What kind of person tells a self-aggrandizing lie, gets called on it, admits publicly that the truth is not at all what she originally claimed -- and then goes out and starts telling the original lie again without changing a word?</p> </blockquote> <p>Yesterday, John McCain talked about the need for reform on Wall Street, vowing that his administration will crack down on the shysters and the greedhogs. Sure. Virtually every chance he's had, he's supporting lifting regulations. Today the Wash Post <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/16/AR2008091603732.html\">has the goods</a> and places them on the front page. McCain wants to \"tap into\" populist anger, writes the paper:</p> <blockquote> <p>But his past support of congressional deregulation efforts and his arguments against \"government interference\" in the free market by federal, state and local officials have given Sen. Barack Obama an opening to press the advantage Democrats traditionally have in times of economic trouble. </p> </blockquote> <p>And, today, I can guarantee you, McCain spokespeople and spinners will tell reporters and cable TV hosts that this obviously true documented record is nonsense and McCain has always been an opponent of such excess.</p> <p>Again, in both cases, these aren't just lies. They're lies about lies. That's a really different thing. In life, a typical person lies. If they get caught \u2013 hopefully, they tender an apology; at the very least they stop telling the lie. But here we have a case where the liars not only don't do either of those things. They just keep on lying. </p> <p>But wait, there's more! Because it isn't only that they lie and then lie about the lies. They follow that by playing the victim, claiming that the allegation from the other people that they're lying is nonsense, or a sign that they're part of the Washington establishment, or \"despicable.\" </p> <p>Imagine this happening in your own life. You knew your spouse was cheating, and she or he kept on denying it and called you despicable. Imagine that in a court of law, a plaintiff or defendant's attorney could lie, get caught, lie again and then get at least some members of the jury to believe that the allegations that he lied were just an elitist plot. That in business, one party could break a contract, lie about it, lie about having lied about it, charge that the other party's willingness to stand by the original terms of the contract showed only that the other party was weak and inflexible -- and still come out of the deal smelling sweet.</p> <p>Other campaigns have lied, and yes, Democratic ones as well as Republican. But none I've ever covered has lied like this one and told lies about the lies and then gone and played the victim to its base voters and then, as a parting shot, shut off all serious press inquiries so that it didn't really have to answer any difficult questions about its lies. John McCain, of \"straight talk\" fame, hasn't spoken with the reporters on his plane in more than a month. </p> <p>So what are the Obama people supposed to do in the face of this? I honestly don't know. You can try to persuade a few figures of authority with some bipartisan credential to step forward and call lies lies, but most such people will be chary of doing that. Or maybe you can get down in the gutter. It's certainly what they deserve.</p> <p>But you can't have an argument with people who play according to these rules. They enforce no code of decency upon themselves, and no one exists to enforce it. The \"objective\" media? Stop joking. They're powerless to stop it; all they really do, as NPR did this morning, is give more air time to the victim-playing about the lies about the lies. We're down the rabbit hole. If these people win, we'll be in a worse place than that.</p>",
  "<p>Last Saturday's Guardian <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/16/labourleadership.gordonbrown\">column</a> by Polly Toynbee boiled down to one single premise \u2013 Britain needs a leftwing party, and if Labour won't do the job, then the Lib Dems ought to. The article criticises Nick Clegg for expediency in calculating \"seat by seat\" the impact of his policies, but then argues that he should move the whole party along the political spectrum simply to fill a gap left by someone else.</p> <p>The whole article is based on a misunderstanding of how the Liberal Democrats operate. The leadership of the party doesn't get together in a smoke-filled room and ask itself: \"Where shall we position ourselves on the political spectrum this year?\" We don't simply rip up last year's policy programme and substitute another one based on where the other two parties have moved. We determine our policy and priorities through our conference process. That is why this week Clegg had to sweat it out while delegates debated the updated position on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/15/libdemconference.liberaldemocrats1\">taxation</a>. Even if the leader had wanted to, the party's processes do not allow him to impose ex-cathedra changes in individual policies, still less to the entire ideological position of the party. Last year (as party leader) Menzies Campbell submitted a speaker's card for the debate on Trident and had his four minutes like everyone else, such is the sovereignty of our party conference. While these processes make changing the party slow, it means that we have a consistent identity from year to year \u2013 which is not a claim you could make about Cameronite Conservatism or Blairite Labour.</p> <p>Suppose we took Toynbee's advice and \"shifted to the left\" to fill a gap in the range of choices on offer to the electorate. Suppose then that Labour get a new left-of-centre leader of whom Toynbee approved. What would be the role of the Lib Dems then? Should we rush back to (now less crowded) centre ground? And how would we justify our sudden policy shift? Perhaps we should pretend that our values had changed or that the world had suddenly changed \u2013 no doubt then to be accused by columnists of having no principles and no identity.</p> <p>The policy packages approved by our party in the last two years include the most redistributive tax policies of any of the mainstream parties and \u2013 as Toynbee admits \u2013 some pretty liberal and progressive responses on <a href=\"http://www.libdems.org.uk/policies/justice-and-crime;show\">law and order</a>. We have also set out our stall as the major party most committed to taking the threat of climate change seriously. There is plenty in that package that will appeal to voters across the political spectrum, and I believe that we will be respected for not simply letting our policy stance be dictated by the passing whims of the temporary positioning of the other two parties.</p>",
  "<p>By 2008 standards the weather on the Dorset coast this week has been sunny enough to encourage hardier Liberal Democrats to risk a swim in the sea. Despite the economic storm raging in the background, the party has had a pretty good conference too. Nick Clegg is patting it on the back today.</p> <p>Not much page-one publicity, but no negative headlines either and they can bask in the unusual sight of their Treasury spokesman, Dr Vince Cable's views being taken seriously by serious people. He is the man quoted first in today's Guardian front-page lead on the meltdown in Wall St and the City.</p> <p>If that was not enough to send Clegg home in a good mood, Lib Dem activists in Bournemouth have swallowed their doubts about his desire to shrink the over-mighty state. </p> <p>When even Chris Huhne, his defeated leadership rival, concedes that the tax-and-spend era is over, something is going on. Clegg is repeating his message in today's keynote speech winding up the conference.</p> <p>In making to what the redoubtable Cable insists is not a move to the right \u2013 what's rightwing about that? \u2013 the party leadership hopes to impress poorer Labour voters feeling the food, fuel and credit squeeze as well as Tory-ish votes it needs to keep if it is to hang on to those southern seats it holds.</p> <p>But are they backing the right horse at the right time as great insurance, banking and mortgage companies totter, the direct result of their own folly and greed over the past two deregulated decades? </p> <p>At a time like this the state can be the only big institution left standing. Governments make their share of mistakes and often get more than their share of the blame \u2013 as with Northern Rock, for instance.</p> <p>But ordinary citizens look to it to protect their savings, their shares, their jobs from the consequences of other peoples misjudgements. With unemployment and other insecurities mounting it is going to cost proper money. No time to be shrinking the state?</p> <p>It is not economic populism to state what is now obvious when the US Federal Reserve has been piling into the market wreck to rescue what can \u2013 or must \u2013 be saved with taxpayers' money. Even the Daily Mail is hurling the money changers out of the temple this week, though they'll be back when the structure has been secured.</p> <p>Clegg's message is more nuanced. He's not anti-state as such. It's true he wants the state and its agencies to do less but do it better. In that regard he does ape David Cameron's language and provides him with some cover \u2013 as well as making a good \"twin Tories\" target for Labour if it recovers its own nerve.</p> <p>But he sees government as an active agent for good. Most of the \u00a320bn he hopes to cut from bad public spending programmes would be redistributed to better ones. He also wants to finance \u00a320bn worth of tax cuts for low and middle earners. About a quarter of that would come from cuts \u2013 that's what alarmed leftwing colleagues \u2013 but most of it from higher taxes on the rich and polluters.</p> <p>Cable set out some of the details earlier this week. A curb on legal tax avoidance \u2014 foreign-based property transactions to avoid stamp duty, for instance, and a fairer capital gains tax regime \u2014 plus those higher taxes on fuel and emissions they have been talking about for a while.</p> <p>Nine out of 10 income tax payers will be better off, Clegg is again saying today. Sounds fine? But that word \"rich\" has a nasty habit of turning out to include quite a lot of people who don't see themselves as rich at all. One in 10 are those who pay higher rate 40% tax, below \u00a340k of taxable income. Not exactly Roman Abramovich. And, of course, people on very low incomes get caught by pollution taxes \u2013 though there would be offsets.</p> <p>Complicated, isn't it? Clegg will need all his own wiles, augmented by Cable's to sell this message in hard times when rival parties are cheerfully distorting his sillier ideas and stealing his better ones. As pollster John Curtice put it here this week, the coming election is both a threat and an opportunity for Clegg \u2014 but mostly a gamble.</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/usa+business/business\">US financial system</a> is caught in a destructive liquidation trap that has falling asset prices cause financial distress, in turn compelling further asset sales and price declines. If unaddressed, it risks sending the economy into deep recession \u2013 or even depression. </p> <p>Current conditions are the result of bursting of the house-price bubble and the end of two decades of financial exuberance. That exuberance was fostered by a cocktail of forces.</p> <p>First, economic policy replaced wages and productive investment as the engines of growth with debt and asset inflation. Second, greed and free market ideology combined to promote excessive risk-taking and restrain regulators. This was encouraged by audacious claims that mathematical economic models mapped reality and priced uncertainty, making old-fashioned precautions redundant.</p> <p>Recognition of the scale of financial folly has created a rush for liquidity. This is causing huge losses, triggering margin calls and downgrades that cause more selling, damage confidence, and further squeeze credit. That is the paradox of deleveraging. One firm can, but the system as a whole cannot.</p> <p>Having failed to prevent the bubble, regulatory policy is now amplifying its deflation. One reason is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark-to-market\">mark-to-market</a> accounting rules that force companies to take losses as prices fall. A second reason is rigid capital standards.</p> <p>Application of mark-to-market rules in an environment of asset price volatility can create a vicious cycle of accounting losses that drive further price declines and losses. Meanwhile, capital standards require firms to raise more capital when they suffer losses. That compels them to raise money in the midst of a liquidity squeeze, resulting in fresh equity sales that cause further asset price declines.</p> <p>Bad debts will have to be written down, but it is better to write them down in orderly fashion rather than through panicked deleveraging that pulls down good assets too.</p> <p>This suggests regulators should explore ways to relax capital standards and mark-to-market rules. One possibility is permitting temporary discretionary relaxations akin to stock-market circuit breakers.</p> <p>Later, regulators must tackle the underlying problem of price bubbles. Currently, central banks are only able to control bubbles by torpedoing the economy with higher interest rates. New flexible measures of control are needed. One proposal is <a href=\"http://www.thomaspalley.com/?p=37\">asset-based reserve requirements</a>, which systematically apply adjustable margin requirements to the assets of financial firms.</p> <p>The Fed must also lower interest rates, and not just for standard reasons of stimulating spending. Lower short-term rates are needed to make longer term assets (including houses) relatively more attractive, thereby shifting demand to them and putting a bottom to asset price destruction.</p> <p>Fears about a price\u2013wage inflation spiral remain misplaced. Instead, the threat is deep recession triggered by the liquidation trap. If inflation is a wild card, now is the time to use the credibility the Fed has earned. Emergency rate reductions can be reversed when the situation stabilises.</p> <p>The great irony is central banks can produce liquidity without cost. Usually the problem is restraining over-production: today, it is overcoming political concerns about \"bailouts\". Those concerns are legitimate, but they also risk inappropriately restricting liquidity provision and unintentionally imposing the huge costs of deep recession.</p> <p>At the moment the Fed is protecting banks and the treasury-dealer network but leaving the rest of the system in the cold. That is perverse given how the Fed went along with expansion of the non-bank financial system. Instead, the Fed should consider an auction facility that makes longer duration loans available to qualified insurance and finance companies too.</p> <p>The facility's guiding principle should be an expanded version of the Bagehot rule. Accordingly, the Fed would auction funds at punitive rates, with loans being fully collateralised. The goal should be to facilitate the repair of distressed financial companies with minimum market disruption and at no taxpayer expense. By creating an up-front facility, the Fed can get ahead of the curve and reduce need for crisis interventions that are always more costly and disruptive.</p> <p>Among financial conservatives there is a view that financial markets deserve punishment for their \"sins\" and only that will cleanse them. This view is often presented in terms of need to restore market discipline and stay moral hazard.</p> <p>The view from the left is strangely similar, arguing Wall Street \"fat cats\" need to be punished. Asset prices should fall, banks must eat their losses, and all but the most essential financial firms should be allowed to fail.</p> <p>Both views have a moralistic dimension, and both risk unnecessary economic suffering. The mistakes of the past cannot be undone. All that can be done is to minimise their costs and then truly reform the system so that they are not repeated.</p>",
  "<p>Last week Jean Sarkozy, the second of President Sarkozy's children and standard-bearer of the youthful rightwing movement, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/2798250/Sarkozys-son-weds-amid-controversy.html\">married</a> Jessica Sebaoun, France's most famous heiress. But comparisons with another heiress, Paris Hilton, would be misleading \u2013 the daughter of the Darty electrical appliances empire has no lurid sex tapes (that we know of) and has not spent time in <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6735631.stm\">jail</a>. Instead, the media storm that broke over the head of the couple came not from glossy magazines but from a pillar of the French satirical press, the weekly Charlie Hebdo.</p> <p>On July 2, <a href=\"http://www.blog-sine.com/blog/\">Sin\u00e9</a>, octogenarian cartoonist and trailblazer extraordinaire, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/03/france.pressandpublishing\">picked up</a> a rumour on the president's son alleged conversion to Judaism and published a piece which included this line: \"He'll go a long way in life, this lad!\" Sin\u00e9's linking of ambition, money and the Jewish community has provoked a public outcry and accusations that he is playing with dangerous stereotypes. Philipe Val, who runs the paper, fired the cartoonist, fearing a lawsuit on the grounds of antisemitism from the Darty family. </p> <p>In France \u2013 home of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_affair\">Dreyfus affair</a> and the notorious collaboration with the Nazis \u2013 commenting on these issues with caustic humour is either audacious or just obscene. Sin\u00e9 maintains that he merely pointed out the ruthless ambition of daddy's little boy, who is \"ready to convert to marry a fabulously rich woman\". For Sin\u00e9 to attack religion is nothing new; nor are his vicious attacks on power and the power of money. His many defenders argue he has the right to outrage readers. His detractors think that even for cartoonists, self-censorship is sometimes the wiser path, particularly when dealing with such sensitive issues. </p> <p>The storm has not abated and has now spread beyond the initial showdown between cartoonist and editor. In the trench warfare between \"pro-Val\" and \"pro-Sin\u00e9\", everything has been scrutinised: Sin\u00e9's obsessions, his bad taste, Sin\u00e9's life \u2013 plus his work and family. Supporters of the cartoonist relished the stepping up of Sin\u00e9's own daughter, Jewish through her mother (Sin\u00e9's ex-wife), who defended him.</p> <p>From newsrooms to the local caf\u00e9s, the Sin\u00e9 defence front has mobilised: more than 20,000 of them signed a petition supporting him, many of them names from the ranks of artistic and intellectual Paris. Even his old enemies, such as the lawyer Gis\u00e8le Halimi, a leading figure in the French feminist movement, came forward to defend him.</p> <p>For his partisans, Sin\u00e9 is guilty of bad taste but not antisemitism. Others point to his legendary drinking as the source of his excesses. His adversaries have dug up one of his most embarrassing moments, during a late-night show on Carbonne 14 radio, in which Sin\u00e9, who could be heard drinking alcohol, stated \"Yes, I am antisemitic and I am not scared to admit it ... I want all Jews to live in fear, unless they are pro-Palestinian. Let them die.\" This was in 1982, right after a terrorist attack against the Jewish community in Paris. Sin\u00e9 has since apologised, excusing it as an \"idiotic bet\" to say something publicly outrageous. Licra, an NGO working against racism and antisemitism, decided against suing him. Only a pro-Israel lawyer finally managed to have him condemned by law. </p> <p>After this latest incident, however, Licra has lodged a complaint of \"incitement to racial hatred\" against Jews and Muslims. The case will be heard in January 2009, and Sin\u00e9 wants his old boss Philippe Val to testify, against whom he has lodged a complaint for unfair dismissal. The judicial soap opera doesn't stop here, as the cartoonist is also suing a French journalist for libel, for explicitly having accused him of antisemitism. </p> <p>From his suburban house, furnished with Scandinavian design pieces (at odds with his quintessentially French image) the caricaturist this week launched his own paper: <a href=\"http://www.sinehebdo.eu/\">Sin\u00e9 Hebdo</a>. It was a runaway success; in 24 hours all of the 140,000 copies had vanished from the shelves. It appeared on the same day that Jessica said \"oui\" to Jean Sarkozy.</p> <p><em>This blog was amended on Wednesday the 17th of September at 12:38.

  "<p><strong>10.34am</strong> It's a dank morning in the capital of culture, writes <em>Andy Wilson</em>, and after heavy rain fell for most of yesterday the start will definitely be delayed - frustrating both for title-chasing Kent and relegation-threatened Lancs. The umpires, John Holder and Jeff Evans, are inspecting as we speak, but they are hopeful that we will have some play today, which would represent progress from the last championship game on a Lancashire outground, the complete wash-out against Surrey at Blackpool last month.</p> <p>One significant change in the Lancashire team is the absence of Dominic Cork, the first championship match he's missed since the club announced his contract would not be renewed. That's got to make sense in terms of team spirit and long-term planning, although it leaves Glen Chapple leading an otherwise callow seam attack comprising Tom Smith, Oliver Newby and Steven Croft. Kent have omitted Neil Dexter after the South African rejected their new contract offer ahead of an expected move to Middlesex, but are otherwise at full strength.</p> <p><strong>10.40am</strong> Good morning from Scarborough, where the start has been delayed half an hour due to a 'damp' outfield, reports <em>Richard Rae</em>. It's a grey, cool morning here on the north Yorkshire coast, but the rope is going around, and it's simply a case of moving everything back 30 minutes to a normal 11am start. Shouldn't lose any overs, if the light holds out.</p> <p>The autumnal air means there's very much an end of season feel inside North Marine Road, not helped by the fact the marquees that house the 'corporates' during the festival have been taken down. Looking over at the pavilion, Michael Vaughan is sitting on the bench outside the Yorkshire dressing room in silent contemplation, thinking how lucky he was to get another central contract perhaps. These contracts, by all accounts, are a lot more lucrative than many people possibly realise. Vaughan, someone who knows about these things tells me, will get \u00a3200,000 plus. No wonder both he and Yorkshire were very pleased.</p> <p><strong>11.18am</strong> Yorkshire could not have made a better start at Scarborough, says <em>Richard Rae</em>. Darren Gough won the toss and choose to field; Matthew Hoggard, who had been doubtful with a shoulder problem, opened the bowling from the Trafalgar Square End; first ball, nothing special, a foot outside off stump, but Marcus Trescothick threw the bat and edged to Gerard Brophy. There is plenty of carry in the pitch, as is traditional here, but it's swinging. Arul Suppiah opened up with Trescothick, and played and missed twice in Deon Kruis' first over. At the other end Justin Langer has just creamed Hoggard square through the offside. Zum 8-1.</p> <p><strong>11.20am</strong> Play has already been abandoned for the day at Chester-le-Street, writes <em>David Hopps</em>, but Durham fans need not fret just yet. Although puddles on the outfield left the umpires in little doubt that there was no chance of any cricket, three days should be plenty of time for the locals to polish off a Sussex side that, even by their outgoing captain Chris Adams' admission, is coming to the end of an era. Sussex shouldn't go down \u2013 they lead Yorkshire and Lancashire by six points \u2013 but a heavy defeat here would cause jitters going into the final round of matches. Durham, in search of a first county championship title, will be hoping for better conditions tomorrow.</p> <p><strong>11.45am</strong> <em>Andy Wilson</em> adds from Liverpool: play is now due to start at 1pm, after an early lunch. Teams and toss to follow.</p> <p><strong>12.01pm</strong> I've been told that today is Technology Awareness Day, writes <em>Paul Weaver</em> at Kidderminster. Unfortunately I've been unable to check up on the veracity of this observation since there is no signal on my mobile phone and as for wi-fi we are reliant on an on-off signal from someone living near the ground who didn't password his connection.</p> <p>Welcome to the out-ground of Kidderminster, where Worcestershire, who need eight points to clinch promotion to the first division, are playing their last match of the season against Middlesex. Unfortunately for those who were hoping to see Graeme Hick's last appearance that has already happened. Weekend speculation that Hick may not be fit enough to play because of a sore right elbow was confirmed this morning. How Worcestershire could have done with a fit Hick, though.</p> <p>They won the toss and chose to bat and in the 11th over they were 36 for three. It is overcast and there is some movement for the quick men. Daryl Mitchell was caught at second slip off the bowling of Tim Murtagh and then Vikram Solanki fell first ball, this time to a fine catch, low down, by Andrew Strauss at first slip. Ben Smith was third out, again to Murtagh, when he had his off-stump knocked back as he attempted an on-drive. It's spitting with rain but at least we're playing, which is more than can be said for much of the country. What an awful season this has been!</p> <p><strong>12.39pm</strong> Nottinghamshire began the day in fourth place and they will be happy enough with their morning's work after losing the toss on what looks to be a flat Oval pitch, writes <em>Lawrence Booth</em>. At lunch Surrey \u2013 all but relegated already \u2013 are 100 for three, having lost the crucial wicket of Scott Newman 15 minutes before the break when he edged Andre Adams to Chris Read to depart for an all-too-typical 61. Newman's last game, against Hampshire here last week, brought him a pair of attractive 50s, so there were high hopes when he moved into the 60s. But this is a player whose temperament has never quite been the equal of his talent: with 1,000 championship runs safely in the bag, he left with the job only half done.</p> <p>Still, it could have been worse for Surrey. Chris Murtagh edged Darren Pattinson to Graeme Swann at first slip in the second over of the morning without a run on the board, and it was 29 for two when Mark Ramprakash, on four, played forward to Charlie Shreck and gave himself out after thin-edging to Read. Newman retaliated with a clutch of attractive boundaries \u2013 including three in successive deliveries off a less-than-impressed Shreck \u2013 only to provide Notts with renewed hope at 94 for three.</p> <p>At least Surrey appear to have picked their side with one eye on the future. Lee Hodgson, a 22-year-old swing bowler, has been handed his first-class debut, and there is a maiden championship outing for the South African-born 19-year-old quick Stuart Meaker. Shoaib Akhtar has made the cut too, which may surprise those who witnessed his performance against Hampshire, but then to drop him after just one game wouldn't look good for a club that can ill-afford more bad PR.</p> <p><strong>12.40pm</strong> Rob Key has won what promises to be a very important toss given the greenness of the pitch, and put Lancashire in, writes <em>Andy Wilson</em>.</p> <p><strong>1.05pm</strong> Lunch approaches at Scarborough, where Somerset are currently 96 for three, writes <em>Richard Rae</em>. Odd morning's cricket. After Trescothick went to the first ball of the day, Langer and Suppiah took the score on to 87 - Langer hitting Darren Gough for five fours in six balls in the process - before the Australian decided to try and smash Adil Rashid into the pavilion, and succeeded only in top edging a straightforward catch to point. Rashid then got Zander De Bruyn, given leg before sweeping at a ball that went straight on. Slightly generous decision - it must have been pretty close to hitting him outside the line of off-stump - but the umpire was Barrie Leadbetter. Standing in his last first class game, BL apparently is only 15 short of the umpiring world record record for leg before decisions. Suppiah, playing watchfully, is 25 not out, James Hildreth on two.</p> <p><strong>1.45pm</strong> Aigburth - no surprises here, with Lancashire, surely the worst batting line-up in the first division, already 22 for three. Their problems started in the fourth over when Paul Horton played a truly appalling shot, chasing a wide delivery from Robbie Joseph that swung even wider and edging to Geraint Jones. Karl Brown, a youngster making his third championship appearance but playing his first innings, fell for a duck, edging a good one that left him from Yasir Arafat, with Justin Kemp's huge hands scooping up the low catch at first slip. Then Mark Chilton, who had driven a couple of pleasing boundaries, was lbw to Joseph.</p> <p><strong>3.19pm</strong> It's not been a session to lift the spirits, writes <em>Lawrence Booth</em> at The Oval, but Nottinghamshire won't be too fussed. Surrey added all of 59 runs in 33 overs for the loss of Jon Batty, lbw to the nagging Andre Adams for 34, and Matt Spriegel, who edged Graeme Swann to slip for 11, and are taking tea at a precarious 159 for five. Usman Afzaal, eyeing up his 1,000 championship runs for the summer, has inched his way to 29, and with him is the first-class debutant Lee Hodgson, who surprised everyone by pulling Charlie Shreck authoritatively for four.</p> <p>In a sense it was a session that encapsulated Surrey's season: nervy, unimaginative, suspicious. Judging by an interview Mark Butcher gave to this morning's Daily Express, it seems the problems have been a while in the making. Butcher believes Surrey were wrong to rely on their older hands to get them out of the second division in 2006 rather than take the opportunity to blood a few young 'uns. He also thinks the comparisons a few years ago between Surrey and Manchester United meant \"expectations gradually got in the way of reality\". Butcher says: \"It perpetuated the moneyed, arrogant, southern so-and-so thing and, to be honest, in the period when we were winning a lot of trophies we were more than happy to play up to that.\"</p> <p>A season or two in the second division with investment in youth may be the answer. And Butcher, who has a year of his contract to run, may have to do the job without his coach and father, Alan. Rumours are rife that he is on his way out. Alan Butcher is one of cricket's good guys. Perhaps what Surrey need now is a bit of old-fashioned ruthlessness.</p> <p><strong>3.35pm</strong> Early tea at Scarborough, where the umpires' definition of bad light does not coincide with that of the crowd, writes <em>Richard Rae</em>. In the few overs we've played since lunch (we also lost ten overs to bad light soon after the break) Somerset have moved to 160 for three, and Yorkshire have missed three chances - two eminently takeable. Richard Pyrah, fielding at third slip, shelled James Hildreth twice in three balls off Deon Kruis.</p> <p>He got two hands to the first, to his right, one to the second. The most criminal miss, however, was Gerard Brophy's attempted stumping of the same player, off Adil Rashid. Hildreth took a step to whack it away through midwicket, was beaten to the wide, and actually took a step towards the pavilion - but Brophy, attempting to take off the bails with the ball in his right hand and with his left hand already in the air, celebrating, missed the stumps. The reaction of the crowd alerted Hildreth something was afoot, and he turned and got his bat back before Brophy took the bails off. Even news of Lancashire's travails hasn't cheered up the locals. Well, perhaps a little.</p> <p><strong>3.46pm</strong> Tea, Aigburth, writes <em>Andy Wilson</em> - not sure if anyone else has been having problems accessing the Guardian site - maybe something to do with Weavs's technology awareness day - but Lancashire are malfunctioning completely. They have lurched to 81 for eight at tea, still 119 short of taking a single batting point from a match where they need to score heavily to stay in control of their own destiny.</p> <p>Stuart Law must have feared the worst when he lost the toss, especially against a strong Kent seam attack. Law was the first of the five wickets that have fallen since the last update, and the first of three Lancashire batsmen bowled by Amjad Khan - terrific, as an occasional Kent watcher, to see him back bowling, and relishing the return to a ground where he took his first five-wicket haul as well as scoring a few runs. Ryan McLaren picked up the other two wickets to fall, trapping Luke Sutton lbw and having Tom Smith caught behind.</p> <p><strong>4.30pm</strong> Aigburth - Lancashire scrambled into three figures but were quickly polished off for 107, notes <em>Andy Wilson</em>. Kent then lost James Tredwell, opening because Joe Denly has been suffering from a migraine all day, in the first over of their reply, lbw to Glen Chapple. But despite the rapid tumble of wickets, Lancashire are unlikely to suffer any points deduction. Chris Broad, who's here as the pitch liaison offier, is inclined to be sympathetic given the difficulties Lancashire have had in pitch preparation, and the fact that swing has been a major contributor to the batsmen's problems. Anyway, how can any county be docked points this season after the recent escapes for Durham and Hampshire? Kent now 12 for one.</p>",

The Tories are now trying to portray themselves as an \"inclusive party\" reaching out to minority communities by choosing <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6958105.stm\">ethnic minority candidates</a> (in unwinnable seats, I hasten to add). This opportunistic courtship of the Muslim vote is made more remarkable by the fact that the Tories have offered very little in terms of policies which address issues affecting Muslims home or abroad. But this is equally true with the lack of Tory policy ideas in many other areas.<br> For too long, some lazy politicians have engaged leaders of Muslim communities as a shortcut to engaging disenfranchised Muslim citizens. The approach of the Labour party should be to use all forms of making contact. No individual or group can claim to speak for British Muslims. There is a debate going on across British Muslim communities up and down the country and we need to listen and engage with it. Our priority must be to address the major obstacles that prevent many Muslims becoming fully active participants in mainstream civil society, while helping individuals to climb the social ladder and take up new opportunities. Before we can put together a good package of policies, we need a much more sophisticated political narrative on which we can build those policies. A politics of fairness as opposed to favours. Without this, policy measures risk being short-term, vulnerable and divisive.</p> <p>In my pamphlet published by the <a href=\"http://fabians.org.uk/\">Fabian Society</a>, Fairness, not Favours, I lay out a range of specific policies in work, education, language and childcare which build on this new politics and aim to link communities together through the recognition that everyone has a stake in the improvement of the life chances of the worse off. <br> But there are two sides to this. British Muslims also need to step up to the plate. We need to take responsibility for our own lives. We need to take more responsibility for our own families, ignore those who propagate conspiracy theories, and above all we need to leave behind our victim mentality. I challenge British Muslims to accept that as strongly as they feel about Iraq or counter-terrorism measures, poverty and inequality have the biggest impact on the lives of the majority of British Muslims and do the most to prevent potential being fulfilled. Even if your passion is foreign policy, your ability to help people thousands of miles away is made much greater if you are an active citizen and player at home in the UK. Of course, foreign policy is important to British Muslims. Not just because of our ethnic origins, but also because of our interconnectedness with our co-religionists overseas. I argue in my pamphlet that rather than this being a reason to fear us as fifth columnists, it gives UK plc a unique opportunity to tap into our faith and background to improve and enhance the UK business community's global links. Britain's diaspora links can also help reshape often negative perceptions of the UK and can achieve outcomes through engagement with overseas Muslim audiences that would not be possible through formal diplomatic channels. British Muslims will know they have understood the challenges facing them when they realise that childcare should matter more than Kashmir. And they will know the Labour party finally understands them when they hear politicians say that addressing the problems of British Muslims is about fairness, and not favours or fear.</p>",
  "<p>The Department of Health has identified nine personality types of heavy drinkers who are at risk of liver damage and other alcohol-related illnesses. They are:</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>\"De-stress drinkers\" use alcohol to regain control of life and calm down. This group includes middle-class women and men. The researchers said: \"They typically have a pressurised job or stressful home life, which leads them to feel burdened with responsibility. Partners often supported or reinforced their behaviour by preparing drinks to help relieve stress\";</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>\"Conformist drinkers\" are driven by the need to belong and they seek a structure to their lives. They are typically men aged 45-59 in clerical or manual jobs. \"They tend to have traditional values and attitudes, with regularly going to the pub being a core part of their weekly, habitual behaviour\"; </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>\"Boredom drinkers\" consume alcohol to pass the time, seeking stimulation to relieve the monotony of life. Alcohol helps them to feel comforted and secure. \"They are typically in the 35-50 age bracket and come from both genders, although the bias is towards women\"; </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>\"Depressed drinkers\" may be of any age, gender or social/economic group. They crave comfort, safety and security. \"Their lives are in a state of crisis and their drinking tends to increase steadily over the period of their depression. They tend to drink very heavily, often at home and alone, over extended periods\";</p> <p> <strong>\u00b7 </strong>\"Re-Bonding drinkers\" are driven by a need to keep in touch with people who are close to them. They include men and women of all ages and social classes, who \"drink most evenings as they catch up with different sets of people in their lives, including friends, family and partners\"; </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>\"Community drinkers\" are motivated by the need to belong. They are usually lower middle class men and women, who drink in large social friendship groups, seeking stimulation and release from everyday life in the company of others. \"If their friends are not in the pub in a particular evening, they would not stay on drinking\";</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>\"Hedonistic drinkers\" crave stimulation and want to abandon control. They are often divorced people with grown-up children, who want to stand out from the crowd. \"They frequently drink to get drunk and could be doing this three or four times a week\";</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>\"Macho drinkers\" spend most of their spare time in pubs. They are mostly men of all ages who want to stand out from the crowd. But, unlike the hedonistic drinkers, they \"want to control and be in control, albeit of others rather than themselves\"; </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>\"Border dependents\" regard the pub as a home from home. They visit it during the day and and the evening, on weekdays and at weekends, drinking fast and often. \"They have a combination of motives, including boredom, the need to conform and a general sense of malaise in their lives,\" the researchers said.</p> <p>The NHS has also launched self-help packs, available online and in printed form, telling drinkers how to calculate the medical risks associated with different levels of alcohol intake. DrinkCheck is available at <a href=\"http://units.nhs.uk/\">nhs.uk/units</a></p>",
  "<p>Thailand's parliament finally elected the brother-in-law of the fugitive former leader, Thaksin Shinawatra, as prime minister today.</p> <p>Somchai Wongsawat, 61, a former bureaucrat and long-serving judge who is married to Thaksin's younger sister, won the support of most of the six-party governing coalition's MPs.</p> <p>The vote appeared to heal rifts that surfaced even within his own ruling People Power party (PPP), which had wrangled for five days to choose a new candidate after Samak Sundaravej was forced to quit as prime minister for hosting a cookery show while in office.</p> <p>The urbane and softly spoken Somchai - in stark contrast to the abrasive Samak - immediately crossed the floor of parliament to shake hands with the opposition leader, Abhisit Vejjajiva. Somchai appealed for unity to heal the divisions that have paralysed Thailand's political landscape.</p> <p>But anti-government demonstrators of the People's Alliance for Democracy - who occupied the prime minister's compound in an effort to evict Samak, accused of being a Thaksin stooge - immediately targeted Somchai.</p> <p>Somchai was derided by the protesters' leaders as yet another crony from the Thaksin administration deposed in the 2006 coup. They pledged to continue the three-week sit-in until the PPP-led government is swept away.</p> <p>\"Thaksin needs someone he can control,\" the protest leader, Somsak Kosaisuk, told the throng camped at Bangkok's Government House. \"He might have a gentlemanly nature and a soft-spoken style and be better than anyone else [in the PPP], but blood is thicker than water.\"</p> <p>The continued opposition does not augur well for Somchai, who vowed to try to see out the government's term, which runs until 2012. Analysts give him a matter of months, with the PPP facing the prospect of dissolution by the courts on the grounds of electoral fraud in last December's poll.</p> <p>Somchai - who was education minister and became caretaker prime minister after Samak - is likely to adopt a more conciliatory style that will help hold together the fractious coalition. His 20 years in the judiciary puts him in proximity to Thailand's powerful royalist-military elite.</p> <p>But his Achilles heel - as opponents see it - is his marriage to Thaksin's sister, Yaowapa Wongsawasdi. She was a senior figure in Thaksin's Thai Rak Thai party and one of 111 MPs banned from politics for five years in the wake of the coup.</p> <p>It will inevitably make it difficult for Somchai - whose appointment must be endorsed by the king, likely within days - to prove that he is his own man, though he has quickly set about trying to do so.</p> <p>\"It is now time for Thailand to unite, to reconcile and solve the conflict,\" he said. \"It is not unusual to be angry, but we have to work together to make Thailand peaceful again.\"</p> <p>Somchai got down to business by implementing a plan to use office space at Bangkok's decommissioned international airport, Don Muang, as the government's temporary headquarters while the PAD refuses to leave Government House.</p> <p>Thailand's supreme court today postponed a judgment on a land corruption case against Thaksin and his wife, Pojaman, who fled to England to evade charges.</p> <p>The judge issued a third warrant for Thaksin's arrest after saying that both must be in court to hear the ruling, which could land them in jail for up to 10 years.</p>",
  "<p>Voting began today to find a new leader for Israel's ruling Kadima party, with the current foreign minister, Tzipi Livni, still ahead in opinion polls.</p> <p>Around 74,000 members of Kadima will take part in the vote with a result not expected until early tomorrow. If the winner succeeds in forming a coalition with other smaller parties within the next five weeks, he or she will become prime minister. Four candidates are running and Livni's strongest challenger is Shaul Mofaz, a hawkish former army chief, who has emphasised his security background.</p> <p>Opinion polls have consistently put Livni, a former lawyer who entered politics a decade ago, a long way in front, although analysts caution that Israeli primary elections are difficult to call particularly since this is the first primary for Kadima, a party formed only three years ago by the then prime minister, Ariel Sharon. If Livni wins and forms a coalition she would be the first female prime minister of Israel in more than 30 years.</p> <p>The latest poll, carried out on Monday for the Ma'ariv newspaper, suggested the gap between the two leading contenders was shrinking but still put Livni well ahead on 42.5%, against Mofaz on 30.4%. The two other candidates, Avi Dichter, the internal security minister, and Meir Sheetrit, the tourism minister, are a long way behind.</p> <p>\"Today we can start to make the change that Israel needs in order to once again be what it should be, what it can be,\" Livni told Israeli Army Radio this morning. \"I know what this country needs ... to continue the process that will allow us to determine the borders of the state of Israel with security.\"</p> <p>Mofaz told the radio station: \"The state of Israel stands before major challenges in the coming years and needs a strong leader who has the courage to decide and the ability to act.\"</p> <p>Although both are from the same party, there are wide differences in their positions. Livni, 50, has been closely involved in the past year of negotiations with the Palestinians and is expected to continue the process if she wins. She argues in favour of a Palestinian state although she is adamantly opposed to the return of even a single Palestinian refugee into what is now Israel. </p> <p>Mofaz, 59, has been much more sceptical about the idea of talks with the Palestinians and is thought unlikely to continue them. He has taken a tough line on Iran and its nuclear ambitions, saying earlier this year that he thought war with Iran was \"unavoidable\".</p> <p>Some Israeli commentators have been unimpressed by either. Sima Kadmon, writing in today's Yedioth Ahronoth, said they lacked charisma and leadership ability. \"It is not an easy choice. Choosing between Tzipi Livni and Shaul Mofaz is like choosing between two shades of grey,\" Kadmon wrote.</p> <p>Today's election has been prompted by a series of embarrassing and high-profile corruption investigations into the prime minister, Ehud Olmert, who is halfway through his four-year term. Police have recommended he be charged, although he may not be indicted for several months. Olmert has promised to resign after today's vote but is likely to stay on as a caretaker prime minister while a coalition is formed.</p> <p>If today's winner gets more than 40% of the vote, he or she will be asked to form a coalition within the next 42 days, which would require drawing in the small and fractious parties necessary to form a government. If this fails, elections must be held within three months. Polls suggest that Benjamin Netanyahu, leader of the rightwing Likud party, is best placed to win if a general election were held now.</p>",
  "<p>Yesterday, we followed Moore from Dreamcast to Xbox 360. Today, there's more from the Microsoft years, including a damning indictment of UK developer, Rare. And what does the rest of Microsoft <em>really</em> think of the Xbox business?<br><br><strong>So during your reign at Xbox, how hands on were you, at a creative level?</strong><br>I ran the entire business \u2013 everything reported to me. So I would go from meetings with McCann Erickson who did the Standoff spot, into an Xbox Live retention meeting to a financial commitments meeting looking at the quarterly numbers \u2013 it was a complicated yet exhilarating time, we were trying to pull all of these pieces together. And the [profit and loss forecasts] of what we were doing would absolutely make your hair curl. </p> <p><strong>Was there any point in this process where you felt out of your depth?</strong><br>Not really \u2013 a lad from Liverpool who was a soccer player?! Why would I feel out of my depth at a strategic multi-million dollar marketing meeting?! No, because we'd all been there from the get-go, as regards to understanding what we needed to do\u2026 I had no business education, I'm not an MBA\u2026 unlike a lot of other people I've worked with who are incredibly smart people, MBA students that have worked their way through the ranks \u2013 that's just not me. </p> <p>I know what I don't know, which is very important in life, so you tend to surround yourself with people that make up for your deficiencies. </p> <p><strong>How was Xbox perceived in the rest of Microsoft?</strong><br>Two very distinct camps. I'd say the great majority of people loved it. It was a great rallying cry, they were proud of the fact we were doing consoles \u2013 it was the first physical thing you could really get behind at Microsoft other than a mouse or a keyboard, and it was entertainment. The great majority loved it. There was a vocal minority that disagreed with videogames as a cultural phenomenon \u2013 the content we were doing \u2013 we did M rated, we did allow GTA to be published on the platform and I had no issues with that\u2026 and then the drain on the company's stock price, because we were a multi-billion dollar investment group and it had an impact on the stock price. </p> <p>From an overall cultural point of view there were people who felt we shouldn't do this, but the great majority were proud of it\u2026 they love the fact that they can take something home to their kids and say, this is what we do. And in the store, the huge Microsoft store, you could buy videogames that said Microsoft \u2013 that was very important to morale at a time when the Microsoft stock hadn't moved.</p> <p><strong>Was Xbox more about getting a presence in the living room than turning a profit?</strong><br>It was certainly very important. We couldn't afford not to be \u2013 we believed that broadband connections were going to move out of the bedroom into the living room, which they have done, or that wireless networks were simply going to take over and your broadband connection would be ubiquitous around the house. There was a huge bet they made on the original Xbox, not to put in dial-up, just to put a broadband modem in there at a time when the great majority of people were still connecting via dial-up modem \u2013 it was a ballsy bet to say, ah we don't care about you, you're a bunch of luddites we're going to move on to the people who connect the real way. </p> <p>And in the same way, not having a hard drive in every Xbox 360 was a hard decision, but we wanted to get price under control. The hard drive in every Xbox killed us; we we're still selling it at $199 and the hard drive was like $70. That's why we prematurely left the original Xbox, because the more we were selling \u2013 there was still great demand \u2013 it was killing us, and there was no way to bring the price down. So in the end we determined at around the 25 million unit mark that we just needed to slow this thing down and just not sell any more, and move to the 360 as quickly as we possibly could. And to this day people still believe we left the Xbox too early but it was purely for financial purposes.</p> <p><strong>What do you think has been the biggest driver for Xbox \u2013 the online component or Halo?</strong><br>It's always been software. We always believe that software drives hardware \u2013 it's razors and blades \u2013 and for better or for worse, Halo and more recently things like Gears of War have been content that's driven\u2026 With Xbox Live Arcade we always believed it would bring in a more casual user, but basically XBLA is casual content for hardcore users. Clearly we needed to broaden our consumer base \u2013 it wasn't about your or I anymore, it was about bringing women in, it was about bringing younger consumers in, but we were still perceived as Halo Box \u2013 and in some senses we were our own worst enemy, in that we had this incredible content, but it continued to define who the consumer was - then what did we do? We backed it up with chainsaws in Gears of War! </p> <p>Then we went off, and I spent a lot of time in the Midlands with Rare, trying to work on stuff that would give us a little bit more balance. And so a few years ago we started working on Viva Pinata, and again we wanted to do it differently because we knew we couldn't just launch pi\u00f1ata at the same time as we were focusing on efficient killing. And so we did a deal with Saturday morning TV who launched a cartoon series which is still very popular to get the pi\u00f1ata characters up and running. So we used Viva Pinata as a broader play into the more casual market to attract younger consumers, female consumers and to take a little bit of the edge off the box.</p> <p>I thought ultimately it would be very successful \u2013 and you know, Microsoft, we'd had a tough time getting Rare back \u2013 Perfect Dark Zero was a launch title and didn't do as well as Perfect Dark\u2026 but we were trying all kinds of classic Rare stuff and unfortunately I think the industry had past Rare by \u2013 it's a strong statement but what they were good at, new consumers didn't care about anymore, and it was tough because they were trying very hard - Chris and Tim Stamper were still there \u2013 to try and recreate the glory years of Rare, which is the reason Microsoft paid a lot of money for them and I spent a lot of time getting on a train to Twycross to meet them. Great people. But their skillsets were from a different time and a different place and were not applicable in today's market.</p>",
  "<p>This sounds like a doomed action.

  "<p>The US government has seized control of the world's biggest <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/insurance\">insurance company</a>, AIG, in an $85bn (\u00a347bn) emergency rescue to avert a \"disorderly\" bankruptcy which threatened to wreak havoc with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/wallstreet\">fragile financial markets</a>.</p> <p>After a marathon day of negotiations in New York, the Federal Reserve reluctantly agreed to lend taxpayers' money on a two-year basis in return for a 79.9% stake in AIG.</p> <p>The highly unusual decision effectively nationalises AIG by transferring control to the central bank. In a sign of the level of alarm about the weakening financial system, the Bush administration set aside its usual orthodoxy of avoiding intervention in the free market.</p> <p>In a statement released late last night, the Fed said it had concluded that a \"disorderly failure\" of AIG could \"add to already significant levels of financial market fragility and lead to substantially higher borrowing costs, reduced household wealth and materially weaker economic performance\".</p> <p>AIG employs 106,000 people in 130 countries and sells 12m policies annually in Britain - including travel insurance and product protection under retailers' own brands such as Boots, Argos, Comet and Sainsbury's. It is shirt sponsor to Manchester United football club.</p> <p>The treasury secretary, Henry Paulson, insisted that AIG's chief executive, Robert Willumstad, stepped down as a condition of the deal. He is to be replaced by Edward Liddy, a former boss of the insurance firm Allstate. AIG's board approved the rescue package at a late-night meeting.</p> <p>Crippled by losses on policies insuring investors against default on exotic financial products, the firm had less than 48 hours to find sufficient cash to meet a rash of contractual obligations. It has been teetering on the brink of following <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/interactive/2008/sep/15/lehmans\">Lehman Brothers</a> into bankruptcy - a scenario which horrified financial experts who said the reverberations would be felt by policyholders, trading partners and investors around the globe.</p> <p>President Bush was quick to lend his backing to the bailout. \"The President supports the agreement announced this evening by the Federal Reserve,\" said a White House spokesman, Tony Fratto. \"These steps are taken in the interest of promoting stability in financial markets and limiting damage to the broader economy.\"</p> <p>The rescue comes a week after a decision to rescue two enormous mortgage companies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. But there are likely to be questions about inconsistency in policy since no government aid was forthcoming to support Lehman Brothers when the Wall Street bank collapsed on Monday.</p> <p>The Democratic chairman of the Senate banking committee, Christopher Dodd, asked: \"Tell me why this situation deserves that kind of infusion of support, whereas Lehman Brothers did not.\"</p> <p>The treasury secretary travelled to Washington last night to brief Congressional leaders. Leading Democrats lent their support, although they suggested that laissez-faire government policies had contributed to AIG's predicament.</p> <p>Barney Frank, the influential chairman of the House financial services committee, told the New York Times: \"This is one more affirmation that the lack of regulation has caused serious problems. That the private market screwed itself up and they need the government to come help them unscrew it.\"</p> <p>The Fed, which engaged Morgan Stanley for advice, had shopped around unsuccessfully for a private-sector solution to AIG's problems. Leading banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley rebuffed appeals to provide funds, as did the world's richest man, Warren Buffett.</p> <p>As rumours of a bailout leaked onto trading floors on Tuesday afternoon, a mood of relief swept the market and the Dow Jones industrial average closed up 141 points to 11,059 - clawing back some of the losses made on Monday when the market suffered its sharpest fall since September 2001. The Australian stockmarket, among the few global exchanges to be open when the bailout was confirmed, rose by 1.2%.</p> <p>The terms of the bailout give sweeping powers to the Fed. The $85bn loan is collateralised by all of AIG's assets and the Fed can veto dividend payouts to the insurer's shareholders. AIG's shares, which had already collapsed by 93% since the beginning of the year, will be left with little value.</p> <p>Experts said the interconnected nature of financial institutions was becoming increasingly clear - and was causing mounting alarm at the prospect of a major bankruptcy.</p> <p>\"It might not just bring down other financial institutions in the US. It could bring down overseas financial institutions,\" said Timothy Canova, a professor of international economic law at Chapman University School of Law. \"If Lehman Brother's failure could help trigger AIG's going down, who knows who AIG's failure could trigger next.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.wigadoo.com\">Wigadoo</a></strong>'s idea is simple enough; it will carry the burden of organising all those group trips that normally mean you max out your credit card. The site first opened in June this year with a team of six based on Borough, London, and two more developers in Eastern Europe. Their backers include a number of angels including one well-known name from web travel, and if things go to plan they will achieve the ultimate web approval when Wigadoo becomes an internet verb.</p> <p>Chief executive <strong>Andy Cockburn</strong> explains how it works.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337693192\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/9/17/1221635746877/cockburn17sep2008.jpg\" alt=\"Andy Cockburn and the Wigadoo team\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andy Cockburn with chief operating officer John Connolly and Uma Rajah chief marketing officer</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>\u2022 Explain your business to my Mum.</strong><br>\"Organising a group of friends is always difficult, especially when money is involved. Whether it's a ski trip or a night at the theatre, someone has to play the role of organiser, and they typically have a tough of a time of it. Sorting out the numbers and money is always difficult. You have to hassle people for commitment to get the plan going, and then chase people for money afterwards. Wigadoo solves these age old problems.\"</p> <p><strong>\u2022 How does that work?</strong><br>\"It's very simple. You propose an idea to your friends by sending them an invite. If your friends are up for it, they're asked to give a payment pledge with a debit or credit card. If you then get enough people, you can collect the money from your friends without needing to go back to them. The money gets put on a virtual prepaid MasterCard that we generate for your event and that you can use instantly to book whatever you want (or you can take the money into your bank account). Everyone does their bit, and the organiser gets an easier time of it.\"</p> <p><strong>\u2022 How do you make money?</strong><br>\"As well as helping organise the group we can also suggest great ideas for things to do with friends. In line with the rest of the online travel industry, we make commission for these leads.\"</p> <p><strong>\u2022 What's your background?</strong><br>\"My own background is as a strategy consultant for Bain &amp; Company. I then went to Insead business school where I met my co-founders (who are formerly of Apax Partners, the Venture capital firm, and Mars, the chocolate bar people). I loved working at Bain but had to do my own thing. Once we came up with the idea for Wigadoo, I couldn't let it go.\"</p> <p><strong>\u2022 How many users do you have now, and what's your target within 12 months?</strong><br>\"We've only been in open beta for a couple of months so it's very early days. We're on track to have 10,000 people attend an event organised on Wigadoo by the end of the year.\"</p> <p><strong>\u2022 How are personalisation and recommendation part of your business?</strong><br>\"Our business is all about people proposing their own ideas to their friends and getting their friends to back it. We're currently developing a part of the site where you can recommend events that you've done so that others can easily replicate the fun you had.\"</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Name your closest competitors.</strong><br>\"The closest competitors are <a href=\"http://www.eventbrite.com/\">Eventbrite</a> or <a href=\"http://www.eventbrite.com/\">Amiando</a> help people organising conferences or parties to sell tickets. Another competitor is <a href=\"http://Fundable.org\">Fundable.org</a> that helps people raise money for artistic projects on good causes, but they charge 10% of the money collected, which doesn't work for events between friends.\"</p> <p><strong>\u2022 What's your biggest challenge?</strong><br>\"The biggest challenge to date was building the payment platform which took over 12 months to do. Now the challenge is encourage people to try it. Since we see ourselves as pioneering a new social purchasing space - which is all about helping people spend their time and money together - this is always going to be a challenge.\"</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Are we in the middle of a new dot com bubble?</strong><br>\"There are certainly lots of people trying to set up internet companies at the moment. That said, those that are actually receiving funding are mostly based on strong and clear business fundamentals with an obvious business model. In the UK especially, I haven't seen many weak ideas or teams receiving funding.\"</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Which tech businesses or web thinkers are the ones to watch?</strong><br>\"For UK tech businesses, <a href=\"http://www.playfish.com\">Playfish</a> (who are doing social games on Facebook) are going to enjoy great success. They've already achieved amazing things in a very short period of time. For Web Thinkers, <a href=\"http://www.avc.com/a_vc/\">Fred Wilson</a> of Union Square who backed <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com\">Meetup.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.delicious.com\">Del.ico.us</a>.

  "<p>Mexico's chamber of deputies is discussing a federal law to combat murderous attacks on journalists. Part of the debate centres on the definition of a journalist. The justice ministry initially favoured a restrictive definition that would exclude people such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lydia_Cacho\"><strong>Lydia Cacho</strong></a>, who is famous for her reporting on paedophile rings, or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Will\"><strong>Brad Will</strong></a>, a cameraman murdered in October 2006. But trying to define who is and who is not a journalist is tantamount to restricting access to news and information.

  "<p>The bankruptcy of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/15/lehmanbrothers.creditcrunch\">Lehman Brothers</a> and the forced sale of <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/americasMergersNews/idUSN1535367520080915\">Merrill Lynch</a>, two of the greatest names in finance, mark the end of an era. But what will come next? </p> <p>Cycles of economic fashion are as old as business cycles, and are usually caused by deep business disturbances. \"Liberal\" cycles are followed by \"conservative\" cycles, which give way to new \"liberal\" cycles, and so on. </p> <p>Liberal cycles are characterised by government intervention and conservative cycles by government retreat. A long liberal cycle stretched from the 1930s to the 1970s, followed by a conservative cycle of economic deregulation, which now seems to have run its course. </p> <p>With the nationalisation of America's two giant mortgage banks, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, following the nationalisation earlier this year of Britain's Northern Rock, governments have started stepping in again to prevent market meltdowns. The heady days of conservative economics are over \u2013 for now. </p> <p>Each cycle of regulation and deregulation is triggered by economic crisis. The last liberal cycle, associated with President Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal and the economist John Maynard Keynes, was triggered by the Great Depression, though it took the second world war's massive government spending to get it properly going. During the three-decade-long Keynesian era, governments in the capitalist world managed and regulated their economies to maintain full employment and moderate business fluctuations. </p> <p>The new conservative cycle was triggered by the inflation of the 1970s, which seemed to be a product of Keynesian policies. The economic guru of that era, Milton Friedman, claimed that the deliberate pursuit of full employment was bound to fuel inflation. Governments should concentrate on keeping money \"sound\" and leave the economy to look after itself. The \"new classical economics,\" as it became known, taught that, in the absence of egregious government interference, economies would gravitate naturally to full employment, greater innovation, and higher growth rates. </p> <p>The current crisis of the conservative cycle reflects the massive build-up of bad debt that became apparent with the sub-prime crisis, which started in June 2007 and has now spread to the whole credit market, sinking Lehman Brothers. \"Think of an inverted pyramid,\" writes investment banker Charles Morris. \"The more claims are piled on top of real output, the more wobbly the pyramid becomes.\" </p> <p>When the pyramid starts crumbling, government \u2013 that is, taxpayers \u2013 must step in to refinance the banking system, revive mortgage markets, and prevent economic collapse. But once government intervenes on this scale, it usually stays for a long time. </p> <p>At issue here is the oldest unresolved dilemma in economics: are market economies \"naturally\" stable or do they need to be stabilised by policy? Keynes emphasised the flimsiness of the expectations on which economic activity in decentralised markets is based. The future is inherently uncertain, and therefore investor psychology is fickle. </p> <p>\"The practice of calmness, of immobility, of certainty and security, suddenly breaks down,\" Keynes wrote. \"New fears and hopes will, without warning, take charge of human conduct.\" This is a classic description of the \"herd behavior\" that George Soros has identified as financial markets' dominant feature. It is the government's job to stabilise expectations. </p> <p>The neo-classical revolution believed that markets were much more cyclically stable than Keynes believed, that the risks in all market transactions can be known in advance, and that prices will therefore always reflect objective probabilities. </p> <p>Such market optimism led to deregulation of financial markets in the 1980s and 1990s, and the subsequent explosion of financial innovation which made it \"safe\" to borrow larger and larger sums of money on the back of predictably rising assets. The just-collapsed credit bubble, fueled by so-called special investment vehicles, derivatives, collateralised debt obligations, and phony triple-A ratings, was built on the illusions of mathematical modeling. </p> <p>Liberal cycles, the historian Arthur Schlesinger thought, succumb to the corruption of power, conservative cycles to the corruption of money. Both have their characteristic benefits and costs. </p> <p>But if we look at the historical record, the liberal regime of the 1950s and 1960s was more successful than the conservative regime that followed. Outside China and India, whose economic potential was unleashed by market economics, economic growth was faster and much more stable in the Keynesian golden age than in the age of Friedman; its fruits were more equitably distributed; social cohesion and moral habits better maintained. These are serious benefits to weigh against some business sluggishness. </p> <p>History, of course, never repeats itself exactly. Circuit-breakers are in place nowadays to prevent a 1929-style slide into disaster. But when the financial system, left to its own devices, seizes up, as it now has, we are clearly in for a new round of regulation. Industry will be left free, but finance will be brought under control. </p> <p>The cycles in economic fashion show how far economics is from being a science. One cannot think of any natural science in which orthodoxy swings between two poles. What gives economics the appearance of a science is that its propositions can be expressed mathematically by abstracting from many decisive characteristics of the real world. </p> <p>The classical economics of the 1920s abstracted from the problem of unemployment by assuming that it did not exist. Keynesian economics, in turn, abstracted from the problem of official incompetence and corruption by assuming that governments were run by omniscient, benevolent experts. Today's \"new classical economics\" abstracted from the problem of uncertainty by assuming that it could be reduced to measurable (or hedgeable) risk. </p> <p>A few geniuses aside, economists frame their assumptions to suit existing states of affairs, and then invest them with an aura of permanent truth. They are intellectual butlers, serving the interests of those in power, not vigilant observers of shifting reality. Their systems trap them in orthodoxy. </p> <p>When events, for whatever reason, coincide with their theorems, the orthodoxy that they espouse enjoys its moment of glory. When events shift, it becomes obsolete. As Charles Morris wrote: \"Intellectuals are reliable lagging indicators, near-infallible guides to what used to be true.\" </p> <p>In association with <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org\">Project Syndicate</a>, 2008.</p>",
  "<p>Eight people were <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/7616281.stm \">convicted</a> on Monday of the murder of four members of a lower-caste Dalit family in the western Indian state of Maharashtra. </p> <p>A Dalit farmer's wife, daughter and two sons were lynched and beaten to death by an upper-caste mob in a land dispute in 2006. The women were also raped. </p> <p>What is unusual about this case is that the perpetrators were successfully prosecuted. Normally, the killers of Dalits walk free. </p> <p>One reason why the murderers have been bought to justice is the rising tide of Dalit militancy. There has been a wave of <a href=\"http://www.daijiworld.com/news/news_disp.asp?n_id=50958&amp;n_tit=Mangalore%3A+Airport+Affected+People+Take+Out+Protest+March\">mass demonstrations</a> by Dalit people demanding justice and equal treatment. Newly confident and organised, the Dalits are fighting back with <a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Chandigarh/Dalit_workers_protest_social_boycott_/articleshow/3469170.cms\">strikes and boycotts</a>.</p> <p>Shaken by this burgeoning protest movement, some Indian authorities are finally being pushed and pressured into action, albeit slowly and exceptionally. </p> <p>About time too. India's 170 million Dalit people, formerly known as \"untouchables,\" are at the bottom of the Hindu caste system. They are victims of the most extreme form of caste discrimination. It is, in many ways, analogous to racism. By virtue of their birth into a Dalit family and community, they are condemned forever to a life of social stigma, exclusion and victimisation. </p> <p><a href=\"http://hrw.org/english/docs/2007/02/13/india15303.htm\">Human Rights Watch</a> has condemned India's abuse of its Dalit people as a \"hidden apartheid,\" comparable to the institutional discrimination of pre-democratic South Africa. </p> <p>According to a major <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/reports/2007/india0207/\">Human Rights Watch report</a>, Dalit people are still today seen by many Indians as sub-human and undeserving of basic rights. Shunned as inferiors and social outcasts, they suffer insults, violence, rape, discrimination and impoverishment. Often forced into de facto slave labour, they are made to eat, sleep and pray separately, and denied equal education and healthcare. In some schools, Dalit children are required to sit separately, at the back of the classroom. Similar segregation happens in housing, temples, hospitals and in relief camps after natural disasters like floods and earthquakes. Many Dalits are refused use of land and water wells. Others are pressed into degrading jobs, ranging from prostitution to the manual clearing of human waste. Payment is often in food, not money. Of those who get paid cash, many earn the equivalent of less than 50p for an eight-hour day. </p> <p>The plight of the Dalits is well-known to the Indian government. In 2006, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh became the first serving Indian prime minister to <a href=\"http://hrw.org/english/docs/2007/02/13/india15303.htm\">acknowledge</a> a parallel between the practice of \"untouchability\" and the abuses of apartheid. </p> <p>He condemned anti-Dalit casteism as a \"blot on humanity\", adding: \"Even after 60 years of constitutional and legal protection and state support, there is still social discrimination against Dalits in many parts of our country.\" </p> <p>This failure by successive Indian governments to adequately address the subhuman mistreatment of the Dalit people was <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/reports/1999/india/\">exposed</a> in 1999 by Human Rights Watch. </p> <p>Similar criticisms were voiced in a <a href=\"http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cerd/docs/CERD.C.IND.CO.19.doc \">2007</a> report by the UN committee on the elimination of racial discrimination. It reiterated that laws protecting Dalits were not strong enough and that existing laws were often not enforced. No surprise there. Anti-Dalit casteism is also deeply entrenched among law enforcement agencies, including government officials, police officers, judges and lawyers. Even many of the people who are employed to ensure the protection of Dalit human rights are either hostile, indifferent or fearful of a backlash if they do their job with any effectiveness. </p> <p>Over 100,000 cases of rape, murder, arson and other abuses against Dalits are <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/reports/1999/india/\">reported in India each year</a>. </p> <p>Some states record conviction rates as low as 2-3%. Moreover, the police themselves are sometimes the perpetrators of abuses against Dalit people. Human Rights Watch <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/reports/2007/india0207/6.htm\">confirms</a> that police officers have been guilty of detaining, torturing and extorting money from Dalits.</p> <p>These abuses are not happening in apartheid-era South Africa. They are occurring, with virtual impunity, in modern-day India \u2013 the world's largest democracy and an emerging economic superpower. </p> <p>If India wants to be an internationally respected world player, as it has every right to be, it needs to eradicate this blight on its national character. As long as the feudal caste system exists, India will never fulfil its potential, economically or ethically. </p> <p>You can help the Dalit struggle for dignity and human rights by emailing the Indian high commissioner in London, Shiv Shankar Mukherjee at hc.london@mea.gov.in </p> <p>Urge him to press the Indian government for tougher laws and stronger law enforcement to protect the Dalit people, backed up with a mandatory education programme to promote Dalit equality in all Indian schools, businesses, temples, mosques, government offices and police and judicial agencies.</p>",
  "<p>Barclays early this morning agreed a $1.75bn deal to buy the core business of Lehman Brothers, the investment bank that filed for bankruptcy on Monday amid one of the worst financial crises that Wall Street has suffered.</p> <p>The bank issued a statement at around 2am in the UK confirming that it would buy Lehman's North American investment banking and capital markets business. It saves around 10,000 jobs on Wall Street.</p> <p>Bob Diamond, the Barclays president who had led the negotiations said the deal was a \"once in a lifetime opportunity for Barclays\".</p> <p>The agreement makes Barclays one of the leading banks on Wall Street with capabilities across equity and debt markets, mergers and acquisitions, commodities trading and foreign exchange. The businesses will be merged into Barclays Capital, although it is not clear whether the Lehman name, one of the oldest on Wall Street, will disappear in the short term.</p> <p>Barclays is paying $250m in cash and taking on $72bn in trading assets and $68bn in trading liabilities. They include mortgage assets, equities, corporate debts, government bonds and commercial paper.</p> <p>In addition, Barclays is paying $1.5bn for the Lehman headquarters, a glass and steel tower just north of Times Square in New York, as well as two data centres in New Jersey. The bank said the price represented the buildings' market values.</p> <p>The agreement is being supported by certain \"strategic\" investors in the bank, who have agreed to subscribe to at least $1bn of new equity. Barclays did not name which investors would be supporting the deal, but among its strategic investors are the Qatar Investment Auhtority, China Development Bank and Singapore's Temasek.</p> <p>Barclays issued a trading statement alongside the deal describing business in July and August as \"satisfactory\". All parts of the business were profitable, it added.</p> <p>While lawyers had still been finalising details of the agreement yesterday afternoon, Diamond, was already acting as though the deal was done. He had addressed staff at Lehman in New York yesterday afternoon, telling them: \"You have a new partner.\"</p> <p>Barclays said the deal does not include the toxic property related investments that proved Lehman's downfall.</p> <p>Neither, for now at least, does the agreement include Lehman's business in London, which was put into administration on Monday, although Barclays would not rule out the possibility when the current deal is done.</p> <p>Lehman was racing to sell off the investment bank before staff and clients began to leave in large numbers, eroding any residual value it might have. Staff have been clearing their desks and walking out with bags or cardboard boxes full of possessions since it became apparent on Sunday evening that the firm was finished.</p> <p>A deadline for completing the deal to buy the North American business has been set for September 24.</p> <p>Barclays had confirmed yesterday that it was back at the negotiating table. The news came less than 48 hours after it had walked away from talks orchestrated by US officials to prevent Lehman falling into bankruptcy.</p> <p>The failure of Lehman, the fourth-largest investment bank on Wall Street, together with the sale of Merrill Lynch to Bank of America, triggered a worldwide sell-off in the financial markets and shook faith in Wall Street.</p> <p>Lehman renewed contact with Barclays on Monday afternoon to see if it would still be interested in some of its assets. Diamond, who led the failed weekend negotiations to take control of Lehman, had remained in the US and worked through the night to hammer out an agreement.</p> <p>One banker who works in the Canary Wharf offices of Lehman said the Barclays deal had gotten a mixed reaction in London. \"We're pleased for our colleagues but it makes people in London feel even more hung out to dry, particularly since they use this corporate slogan of having a 'one firm' culture,\" he said.</p> <p>Lehman Brothers is filing an emergency motion with the Bankruptcy Court seeking a hearing to obtain approval for the acquisition.</p> <p>The bank filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, which provides protection from creditors while it liquidates its business. The operations in the UK were put into administration and staff reacted with shock and anger as they turned up for work on Monday and were in most cases told to go back home again.</p> <p>Frustration was clearly evident yesterday. Staff had been given a two-page Q&amp;A sheet, but one banker said it contained considerably more questions than answers. \"Senior management has been noticeable by a complete absence of information,\" he said.</p> <p>The atmosphere in the office, he added, was \"very informal, there's only a smattering of people around there at any time just hanging around, using the email or using the phones.\"</p> <p>Barclays has grown its investment banking division rapidly under Diamond's 10-years at the top. He was involved in disbanding the bank's last disastrous foray into global financial markets, BZW, and there have been some concerns that the bank might repeat past mistakes.</p> <p>John Varley, the Barclays chief executive said the deal \"accelerates the execution of our strategy of diversification by geography and business in pursuit of profitable growth.\"</p> <p>Barclays said the deal would give it a top three position in the US capital markets. The firm said it would also extend Barclays Capital's range of investment banking products, with the addition of Lehman Brothers strong US M&amp;A and equity capital markets franchises.</p> <p>The deal will result in a significant lift to the amount of earnings from the US. \"We will now have the best team and most productive culture across the world's major financial markets, backed by the resources of an integrated universal bank,\" Diamond said.</p> <p>Lehman listed assets of $639bn, making it the biggest bankruptcy filing ever, 10 times the size of the energy firm Enron when it went bust in late 2001.</p> <p>Frustration at Lehman in New York had been growing yesterday, particularly over its chief executive, Richard Fuld, who had still to address workers directly. \"We don't know what is going on,\" one Lehman banker said outside the firm's offices in midtown Manhattan. \"Fuld hasn't said anything to us yet; we're all uncertain whether we have got jobs or not.\"</p> <p>Figures out yesterday showed hedge funds and other investors that had been shorting Lehman's stock since March had made $29bn from the firm's demise.</p>",
