  "<p>Simon Callow wears the mantle of Charles Dickens as comfortably as a Victorian gentleman might have sported a velvet smoking jacket. That is not to say that the two dramatic monologues he delivers during A Festival Dickens don't represent a stretch for him. Both his characters are common types, whose dropped aitches and muddled grammar are ill-suited to such an aristocratically fruity voice. For the most part, he succeeds in keeping its fruitiness in check - until a word or phrase proves too irresistible, and he starts rolling its consonants and emphatically savouring every syllable.</p> <p>The first tale, about Mr Chops, a circus dwarf who longs for riches and a higher social standing, represents Dickens at his mawkish, moralistic worst. Essentially the story is a self-righteous warning against ambition, and it is enlivened only by the brief descriptions of the erotic thrill Mr Chops enjoys while sitting on a barrel organ. The second tale, of market salesman Dr Marigold, is no less sentimental, but considerably more absorbing. Following the death of his violent wife and beleaguered daughter, Marigold adopts a deaf, mute girl and teaches her to communicate. He is a man complex with guilt and good intentions, and Callow, dressed in an outrageous orange wig and olive knickerbockers, inhabits the character lovingly.</p> <p>Dickens himself used to perform these monologues, and it's highly likely his show seemed old-fashioned even 150 years ago. Surrounded at the Fringe by bright young things building new and sometimes exciting models for theatre, Callow here appears utterly outdated.</p> <p>Yet there is something pugnacious about his devotion to classic storytelling that makes his show seem almost like a breath of fresh air. There are no tricks and no fireworks, just a man recounting two stories. If the first is appallingly dull, the second resonates and moves.</p>",
  "<p>It should have been a poignant reunion, when Bob and Bruce Bogle met their maker at Stonehenge - but they just stared blankly ahead. But then it was quite hard to recognise the student perpetrators of an outrageous stunt among the grey haired, or bald, retired professionals assembled among the stones. </p> <p>They last all met up at dawn on an icy day in February 1966- and have kept the secret of that meeting ever since. \"We never put any money in the collecting box when we went in over the fence all those years ago, so we were a bit worried about owning up,\" Martin Bergs, a retired chemist, said. </p> <p>Now it can be told: the infamous 1966 Bogle invasion of Stonehenge, a story that went around the world, was a Manchester student rag-week publicity stunt which went spectacularly wrong since nobody outside the gang of plotters had the faintest clue what it was all about. All the world knew 42 years ago was that staff arrived to find the ancient monument invaded by 16 lifesize wooden stick men. Each had painted Beatles moptop hair, a name on their skinny chest and clutched curious implements. Bruce, Bob, Boris Bogle and their brothers stood, sat, or - having blown over in the wind despite cord supports and sacks of sand weights - sprawled on the stones like students sleeping off a heavy night. </p> <p>Before the horrified caretakers gathered up and burned them, Austin Underwood, a local school teacher, arrived and photographed the Bogles in situ - images which appeared in many national papers including the Guardian. </p> <p>By then the plotters, faces still blackened like paratroopers on the advice of a fellow student with a - military background, were scoffing a large breakfast at Bergs' sister's flat in Bristol, before driving back to Manchester in his ancient Ford Popular - bought for \u00a350 after a summer's hard work - and a battered former post office van requisitioned from one of students with wheels. </p> <p><strong>Shouted motto</strong></p> <p>The perpetrators waited confidently for the world to get the joke. The Bogles were the University of Manchester rag-week symbol. It featured on neckties, and the name was lent to a gruesome rag-week tradition, a 54-mile walk, usually done in brutally bad weather, called the Bogle Stroll. The figures built over copious late night mugs of coffee in the hall of residence they all shared, St Anselm's. On Saturday the reunited pranksters shouted its motto - fides quaerens intellectum, \"faith seeking understanding\" - at the few bemused dawn Stonehenge tourists and carried the traditional Bogle accessories, a mallet, or \"headbanger\", and a collecting box.</p> <p>But nobody did get the joke, not even the Guardian. To their amazement their Bogles were interpreted as everything from fascist to druidic to occult symbols. And by then there had been such outrage over another Manchester rag-week stunt, when students kidnapped an eagle from London Zoo, that they were afraid to own up. Ever. </p> <p>Berg's son, 30-year-old Robert, who came to Stonehenge to witness the truth of a half-believed family legend, said: \"When we were children dad always said to us, 'If you can't be good be careful, and if you can't be careful don't get caught.'\" </p> <p>A Guardian story earlier this summer brought the guilty men out of wretched lives as fugitives from justice - and as engineers, chemists, teachers, IT experts, business consultants, a musical instrument maker, Bergs who became very big in adhesives, and proudest boast, Peter Davison, the man who introduced the first council wheelie bin in Britain. Davison hadn't met up with co-prankster Graham Johnson in 40 years.</p> <p>Only Bruce and Bob survived the Bonfire of the Bogles. They were rescued by Underwood, who gave them sanctuary in his garage. A few months ago his widow, Mary, offered them to the archaeologist Julian Richards as part of an exhibition at Salisbury museum of Underwood's eccentric collection of Stonehenge memorabilia. </p> <p>Several Boglers read the report, and knew that the hour of confession and repentance had come. They all hope to meet up later this year, but three, with Ken Moss joining in on speakerphone from a small boat on a rough sea off the Irish coast, came to meet their creations again within the Stonehenge circle - and they didn't pay to get in this time either. Richards, who has spent most of his life working in and around Stonehenge, is enchanted at the resolution of at least one of the site's many mysteries. </p> <p>\"When I first clapped eyes on Bruce - who has become the real star of the exhibition - I never thought that we would find out who had created him and his Bogle brothers,\" she said. \"I have always assumed that it must have been students and would any students from the 1960's remember much about their time at university? </p> <p>\"The 60s were the era of painting Stonehenge with rag slogans - if only the other rag stunters had been as considerate as this lot. It was all done with such care - it's just a pity the custodians of the time didn't have more of a sense of humour, and perhaps then they wouldn't have consigned the majority of the Bogles to the flames.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Inspired by Stonehenge continues at Salisbury Museum until September 20</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Tuesday August 12 2008. The Manchester Guardian, which \"failed to get the joke\" in 1966, was already by then the Guardian. This has been corrected.</p>",

  "<h2>...take a penalty under extreme pressure</h2> <p><strong>Alan Kennedy scored Liverpool's decisive kick in the European Cup final penalty shoot-out against Roma in 1984</strong></p> <p>It was pressure I had never experienced before and it's fair to say Joe [Fagan, the Liverpool manager] probably had more confidence in me than I did. I had taken penalties before but this time around it was definitely different. The goalkeeper looked massive and the goal looked small, tiny really. This definitely affected me as during my run-up I did what you are told never to do. I changed my mind about where I was going to place the ball. Initially I decided on bottom-left of the goal but then I went for top-right. Thankfully the ball went in. Having scored such an important goal, I wanted to celebrate properly and went to do a double somersault. In the end I just jumped on the spot - not one of my finest moments. But it didn't matter, the important thing was I scored when it mattered most.</p> <h2>...dislike a team-mate</h2> <p><strong>Rob Lee first trained with England in autumn 1994</strong> </p> <p>Alan Shearer and I are great friends but it wasn't always so. We laugh about it now but, when I first linked up with England, Alan [then a Blackburn striker] rarely used to say a word to me. I don't think he got beyond \"hello\" and I thought: \"How bleedin' arrogant can you get?\" It's hard to believe we get on brilliantly these days but I acquired totally the wrong impression of him - meanwhile he says I just walked past him without speaking so he just thought I didn't like him. The other England lads knocked around in established friendship groups and I wondered whether Alan and some of the others didn't think I should be in the international set up but I gradually got to know and like them.</p> <h2>...play in a cauldron of hate</h2> <p><strong>Steve McManaman played in El Cl\u00e1sico for Real Madrid in Barcelona </strong></p> <p>It's like nothing else. In Spain away fans don't travel so you've got 100,000 Barcelona fans absolutely baying for blood. I played in the game when Luis Figo had a pig's head thrown at him when he took a corner. It was horrifying. We'd go from the hotel to the training camp and have armed guards alongside us, and you'd go slow because of the traffic. Then you'd turn off the main road and you'd have a tirade of bottles flying at the bus and the windows would smash. The players would huddle together in the middle of the coach. I used to love it actually, I'd be dead excited and the exhilaration would pull you together as a team. </p> <h2>...face Fernando Torres when he is clean through</h2> <p><strong>Craig Gordon twice played in goal for Sunderland against the Liverpool striker last season</strong></p> <p>If I can pull off a save in a situation like this, I would actually take more satisfaction than a penalty save. You feel as if you have pulled the team out of a big hole. The two key things to do are to stay big for as long as possible and, crucially, force the striker into making a decision. If you go down too early, come rushing out too early or take up a poor position, you make it easy for him to pick a spot to score into. To guys like Fernando Torres, it is easy from there. Once he has made that decision, all you can do is react as quick and as best you can; that is why reactions and speed of thought are so important to goalkeepers. The odds are his favour, he will always be expected to score. It is a battle for the goalkeeper, but one I enjoy. There is no point trying to catch his eye but, while people may say you should solely watch the ball, there are clues in his body language as to what he is going to do. And if you read that language correctly and force him into shooting from an awkward angle, either too early or too late, the odds are back in your favour.</p> <h2>...play in a fairytale</h2> <p><strong>Jamie Collins captained Havant &amp; Waterlooville at Liverpool in the FA Cup fourth round in January</strong></p> <p>It was incredible to take the lead against Liverpool, not just once but twice. We didn't expect to score there but having it done it once, our confidence immediately went up and all the lads were geeing each other up to do it again, which we did. It made it more special that both goals were in front of the Kop. I remember that while we were celebrating the second goal, the home fans began applauding us, which was amazing. Hearing that, I looked at the guys and told them to soak in what was happening and to remember this day for the rest of the lives as such a moment would never happen again. It definitely hasn't for me.\"</p> <h2>...face your old club</h2> <p><strong>Steve Claridge has played over 1,000 games for 16 English league teams</strong></p> <p>It's pretty difficult, horrible actually, because you're playing against guys who you've built up a close relationship with in the past. Unfortunately, I did quite a lot of it during my career. I remember going back to Cambridge United when I was at Aldershot and the Cambridge boys had a \u00a350 competition to see who could kick me the hardest. You can have a laugh after the game but for that 90 minutes it is very tough. I've had different reactions from the fans. I went back to Millwall and they sang my name, and returned to Leicester, scored a goal and they sang \"Super Stevie Claridge\". I got a tough reception going back to Pompey but that's because they hadn't wanted me to go. With the fans it tends to depend on the circumstances in which you leave.</p> <h2>...score an own goal</h2> <p><strong>Dejan Stevanovic scored for West Brom while playing for Portsmouth in 2004 </strong></p> <p>It may be an accident or may be because of your own stupidity but, whatever the reason, you have to immediately put it in the past and get on with the match. If you don't then it will ruin your concentration and perhaps make you score another one, which would be a disaster. I have always been the type of person who, if I have scored an own goal, will go into the dressing room afterwards and say sorry to my team-mates. That doesn't make it any better but I feel it is the best thing to do.</p> <h2>...make the best ever save</h2> <p><strong>Gordon Banks saved from Pele as England played Brazil in 1970</strong></p> <p>It was a bit special because Pele was special. I've never seen a player as good, ever. It was 0-0 and we were playing quite well. Maybe if it had gone in our heads might have gone down and we might not have played so well. When Pele headed the ball he was half-shouting \"goal\" and turning away to celebrate. It all happened very quickly. I was just looking at the ball and where I was landing on the hard ground. Once I got my hand to it I hadn't a clue where it was going. From the angle, I thought it was still going into the net. It was only when I landed that I saw it was behind me and I realised I'd made the save. There was an almighty roar in the stadium. Half of them were cheering a goal, and then when it bounced up over the bar the other half were cheering the save.</p> <h2>...be new boy at a huge club</h2> <p><strong>Alan Hansen joined Liverpool from Partick for \u00a3110,000 in 1977</strong></p> <p>Intimidating. When I signed Liverpool had just won the First Division and were going for a treble with the FA Cup and the European Cup final in Rome. I arrived there and I was totally intimidated. But the players were brilliant to me. The night I arrived Phil Thompson and Terry McDermott came to the hotel and took me out for a drink. Obviously I'd signed for the best club in Europe at the time which made me feel like a million dollars. But I was really nervous, and them coming round was just great. That was one of the secrets of Liverpool's success. People coming to the club were made really welcome and I was no different. In fact Bob Paisley himself came and picked me up at Lime Street when I first came down from Partick. It was unbelievable. It was one of his ways of making you feel welcome.</p> <h2>...tire during extra-time</h2> <p><strong>Frank McLintock captained Arsenal's 2-1 win v Liverpool in the 1971 Cup final</strong></p> <p>We won in extra time in oppressive heat. When Charlie George scored it took me ages to get up to celebrate with him, I was as weary as an 80-year-old. I have no memories of the last eight minutes. I must have run around purely on instinct and when the final whstle went my legs buckled with relief. When I hoisted the Cup I was totally blank and detached. I had given everything I had and there was nothing left to give. I could enjoy the civic reception in Islington the next day more and was deliriously happy that day but at that moment in the royal box I felt like a zombie.</p> <h2>...make your England debut</h2> <p><strong>Rob Lee made his debut against Romania at Wembley in October 1994</strong></p> <p>I scored on my England debut. It was not only something I'd long dreamt about but one of those rare occasions when you know that life really can't get much better. The preparation hardly proved ideal though as I had slightly injured my right foot. When [manager] Terry Venables asked about the foot I said I was fine. The initial build up seemed incredibly slow but then time suddenly started flying and there I was alongside Paul Ince in central midfield. I didn't do much early on, [Ilie] Dumitrescu scored and I thought, \"This might be my only chance and I'm blowing it.\" Then, just before half-time, Graeme Le Saux crossed, I made a late run into the box and Alan Shearer headed down beautifully for me to shoot first time, right-footed, under the keeper. Afterwards a driver was waiting to take me back to the north-east for training with Newcastle the next morning. Five minutes into the journey starvation set in and I raided a McDonalds for a McChicken and chips and a Mars bar. The driver dropped me off at 4am and, still high on adrenalin, I sat up reading newspapers we'd forgotten to cancel.</p> <h2>...make a monumental decision as an official</h2> <p><strong>Darren Cann awarded Arsenal a 90th minute equaliser v United in 2007</strong></p> <p>I was glad that when William Gallas struck the shot I was in the optimum position on the goal-line. I watched the whole of the ball cross the line and conveyed my decision to Howard Webb, the referee, shouting \"It's a goal.\" I didn't think about the consequences. There's so much pressure that I don't think you could perform effectively if you thought about 60,000 making a crescendo of noise. There's a couple of lines from Rudyard Kipling's poem If which sums up what we go through. \"If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs and blaming it on you, if you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, but make allowance for their doubting too.\" I think that applies to Gallas' goal, when you have to trust yourself to know you are right. I keep that line in my kitbag.</p> <h2>...be famous for one thing</h2> <p><strong>Roger Hunt played up front in England's 1966 World Cup-winning team</strong></p> <p>Moments like Geoff Hurst's second goal [the disputed goal where Hunt celebrated rather than putting it back over the line] get mentioned so often, people ask why didn't you do this, why didn't you follow it in. It's only because England haven't won it since that it gets brought up every four years. You can get fed up with talking about it. Sometimes I feel lucky to have been picked to play. It means everything I do now is connected to what happened 40 years ago. After the final I was back with Liverpool within a week, getting ready for the Charity Shield. Bill Shankly wasn't too happy that England had won the World Cup. \"Forget that now,\" he said. \"You're back playing at Liverpool.\"</p> <h2>...be told your career is over</h2> <p><strong>Norman Whiteside retired with a knee injury aged 26 after nine years with Manchester United and Everton</strong></p> <p>Moments after my 13th operation in 10 years, Everton's surgeon said to me: \"You'll spend the rest of your life in a wheelchair if you carry on.\" So, it shouldn't really have come as a shock to me when, after six months of trying to defy his diagnosis, I accepted that I couldn't reach the standards I'd set myself and announced my retirement. It didn't hit me until the day after, a day spent crying in bed with the duvet over my head. It wasn't self-pity but grief for a future I had lost and fear of how I was going to manage without it. All the bravado you adopt down the pub about the shortness of your career doesn't make you feel any better when the day dawns. It takes months to answer the question that reverberates around your head: \"If all you've ever wanted to do is play football and all you've ever done is play football where do you turn when football finishes?\" Pride picks you up and motivates you to go on but the sense of loss is hard to shake off for years.</p> <h2>Q&amp;A: Steve McManaman</h2> <p><strong>Can you hear the crowd when it shouts advice like 'Man on!'?</strong> </p> <p>The crowd always make sure you know. You do notice it when you start playing in front of big crowds, and it helps.</p> <p><strong>Does the physio's magic sponge do any good?</strong></p> <p>There's no away a bit of water is going to fix an injury. You get a bit of time out and perhaps that takes the sting out of the knock. It's when you start running that you know how badly injured you are. </p> <p><strong>Do you trust a player with the ball if he's having a shocker?</strong></p> <p>Football is a confidence game so if you've given the ball away five or six times it can be hard, but you have to keep wanting the ball and have trust in your team-mates. You just don't have time to look for who's playing well.</p> <p><strong>Do you communicate with your manager much during a game?</strong></p> <p>At Liverpool we'd get quite a lot of advice from the sidelines. I'd welcome it. As a winger they'd say \"get wider\" or \"tuck in\". You don't have to agree with what they say, but sometimes they are better placed to get a view of the game. </p> <p><strong>Is it easy to find the pace of the game when you come on as sub?</strong></p> <p>It can be very difficult. It helps if you have a good first touch and maybe set up a chance, or you can end up chasing the game, looking for the ball and if you don't find it you can quickly run out of puff. </p> <p><strong>Is the game rife with grudges?</strong></p> <p>There's always someone that has wound you up in a previous game, or kicked you or something like that. Some players hold them for a long time, like Roy Keane did with Alfie Haaland. As a winger you could wind another player up by beating them or making them look silly, and you'd remember someone who'd kicked you.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Steve McManaman is a pundit for Setanta Sports, who will show 46 Premier League games exclusively live, and many England matches</p>",
  "<p>The flare-up of major hostilities between Russia and Georgia has been dubbed by some \"the pipeline war\". The landlocked Caspian sea's huge oil reserves are a factor, especially since Georgia became a key transit country for oil to travel from Baku in Azerbaijan to the Turkish port of Ceyhan on the Mediterranean.</p> <p>The pipeline, which was completed in May 2006, is the second longest in the world. Although its route was chosen in order to bypass Russia, denying Moscow leverage over a key resource and a potential source of pressure, the current crisis in the Caucasus is about issues far bigger than oil.</p> <p>The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline is only a minor element in a much larger strategic equation: an attempt, sponsored largely by the United States but eagerly subscribed to by several of its new ex-Soviet allies, to reduce every aspect of Russian influence throughout the region, whether it be economic, political, diplomatic or military. </p> <p>Georgia's President Mikheil Saakashvili is the region's most enthusiastic proponent of this strategy. His \"pipeline neighbours\", Azerbaijan and Turkey, are less virulent. They have been trying to reap the economic benefits of Caspian oil while keeping good relations with Russia and avoiding provocations. </p> <p>The question now is whether Saakashvili has over-reached himself. Has his escalation of the South Ossetian crisis done more than destroy any chance of normalising Georgian relations with Russia as long as he remains president? Has it reinforced his image among many western leaders as a hothead, and set back his hopes of getting a promise from Nato this autumn to start membership proceedings? France and Germany led Nato's cautious camp in April when they forced President Bush to delay a membership action plan for Georgia for months. Their argument that Georgia is not yet ready may well be strengthened now.</p> <p>The sudden crisis has put the United States on the spot. While supporting Georgia's Nato ambitions, the White House was leery of military action, knowing it could do little in the face of a powerful Russian response. Visiting the former Soviet republic in 2005, President Bush urged Saakashvili to keep cool. \"Georgia's leaders know that the peaceful resolution of conflict is essential to your integration into the transatlantic community,\" he told a huge rally in Tbilisi. </p> <p>Saakashvili's supporters claim Nato's delay was what emboldened Russia to stir up tension in Abkhazia (the other rebel area of Georgia) and South Ossetia this spring and summer. \"It was interpreted by the Russians as a window of opportunity,\" George Kandelaki, deputy chair of the Georgian parliament's foreign relations committee, said yesterday. Like other Georgians, he argued that it was not his country's forces that took the initiative last week for escalation in what had been in recent months a low level, tit-for-tat series of border incidents.</p> <p>The fighting backfired, and the Russian counteroffensive now seems aimed at capturing the 40% of South Ossetia which was under Georgian control until last week. \"They [the Russians] control pretty much all of South Ossetia now,\" Kandelaki said, adding: \"They're trying to take over all of Abkhazia.\"</p> <p>If the Russians succeed, they will have to decide whether to keep the newly acquired territory as a bargaining chip for negotiations with Saakashvili, or go to the extreme of encouraging South Ossetia, now unified, to do what most of its inhabitants want - proclaim independence from Georgia and a referendum on joining North Ossetia, its ethnic twin on the northern side of the Caucasus mountains. Russia's prime minister, Vladimir Putin, hinted at the tougher option, when he told Ossetian refugees this weekend that Georgia had lost the right to rule the territory.</p> <p>When the fighting ends and the dust settles, Saakashvili may also face an onslaught from his political opposition in Georgia. In the heat of battle, parliamentary leaders have rallied round the national flag, but if a ceasefire comes with all Georgian troops and civilians driven out of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, Saaksahvili may be called to account for losing not just territory but the chance of early membership of Nato as well.</p>",
  "<p>Russian forces were moving to take total control of South Ossetia last night as Georgia withdrew troops amid intense diplomatic efforts for a ceasefire to end the three-day conflict in which 2,000 people have reportedly been killed and up to 22,000 displaced. Seizing the opening offered by President Mikheil Saakashvili's doomed military incursion last week, Moscow also insisted the Georgian leader should resign, according to senior US diplomats.</p> <p>Russian aircraft bombed Tbilisi's international airport hours before the French foreign minister, Bernard Kouchner, was due to land on an EU mission, the Georgian interior ministry said. Last night it was reported that Russia sank a Georgian ship after coming under attack.</p> <p>Russia and the US clashed at the UN security council - meeting for the fourth time in four days to discuss the crisis - over charges that Moscow wanted \"regime change\" in Georgia. </p> <p>Zalmay Khalilzad, the US ambassador to the UN, asked his Russian counterpart Vitali Churkin: \"Is the goal of the Russian Federation to change the leadership of Georgia?\" Churkin replied: \"There are leaders who become an obstacle. Sometimes those leaders need to contemplate how useful they have become to their people.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, the tide of refugees fleeing ruined towns and villages showed no sign of ending last night as Russian forces pushed forward after Saakashvili pulled his bloodied troops out of the territory. </p> <p>People spoke of their ordeal since an unexpected incursion by Georgian forces into Tskhinvali, the capital of the breakaway region, provoked a massive Russian response.

Georgian snipers were firing at us from the forest. My brother stayed to fight. Our grandparents' home was reduced to rubble. We don't know where they are. Nothing is left of their village.

Neither side is allowing independent reporters into the worst affected areas. Gori, the main staging post for Georgian troops on the way to and from South Ossetia, was largely a ghost town last night after thousands of residents escaped from Russian air attacks, a local journalist told the Guardian. \"The town and many nearby villages are too dangerous. There are many wounded. No one knows how many are dead,\" said Saba Tsitsikashvili. </p> <p>Georgia claimed its army's retreat in the face of overwhelming firepower was designed as a humanitarian gesture to prevent further Russian air attacks. \"We have decided to redeploy our troops to get a chance to resist a superior Russian armed force with other methods,\" Timurt Yakobashvili, a Georgian state minister, said. </p> <p>President Bush's deputy national security adviser, James Jeffrey, warned Russia of a \"significant long-term impact\" on US-Russian relations if Moscow continued its disproportionate actions. </p> <p>Russian officials rejected claims that Moscow was trying to widen the conflict into Georgia's other breakway region of Abkhazia.</p> <p>In a series of media interviews, Saakashvili sought to bring the United States fully behind him. After speaking to Bush by phone, he told Germany's Rhein-Zeitung newspaper: \"[Bush] understands that it's not really about Georgia but in a certain sense it's also an aggression against America. The Russians want the whole of Georgia. The Russians need control over energy routes from central Asia and the Caspian Sea. In addition, they want to get rid of us, they want regime change.

  "<p>Your commentary on the Russian invasion of Georgia - in particular, your editorial (Prisoner of the Caucasus, August 9) - is deeply worrying. Russia has invaded a much smaller country whose affairs it has continuously meddled in. Yet your writers appear to think Georgia is at least as responsible as the much larger aggressor.</p> <p>Russia has a history of invading neighbours in response to requests from local minorities, from Poland and Hungary to Czechoslovakia. The fact that wrongs have been committed in the target country - such as attacks on Communist party officials in the eastern European countries - is no excuse. There are plenty of other independent countries in Russia's \"near abroad\" with large minorities of Russian nationals aggrieved at their marginalisation. Presumably if Russia invades them, it will be partly their fault too.</p> <p>Using the logic of your commentators, Hitler had a point in seizing the Sudetenland, where the German minority wished to become part of the Greater Reich. Countries are often subject to unexpected aggression in August when minds are elsewhere. It appears that the Guardian has been similarly distracted.<br><strong>John Willman</strong><br>London </p> <p>Let's call things as they are. Russia has invaded Georgia. My government has repeatedly and correctly claimed that Russia supports separatists in Georgia and cannot claim the role of impartial peacekeeper. That is why a resolution to this dispute has not occurred. That is why any responsible government would have plans to control their own territory should all avenues of reasonable diplomacy and negotiation be exhausted. Too many governments have refused to listen to the implications of our warnings. The events of the last two days have sadly proven Georgia correct. As I write, the Russian Federation is bombing targets throughout my country. You are suggesting that a great power's whimsical destruction of a small neighbour should be appeased. We expected more from the great tradition of the Guardian.<br><strong>Giorgi Badridze</strong><br>Acting head of mission, Embassy of Georgia, London </p> <p>The west has prodded Georgia to act against the Abkhazians and South Ossetians by training Georgian troops for this slaughter. The key is to deny Russia any ability to control energy flow from the Caspian sea region. However, Russia's justified response to Georgia's unprovoked attack on South Ossetia is no different to Nato's barbaric attack on Serbia for seeking to recontrol areas of Kosovo imbued with Islamic terrorists. The west's hypocrisy and disregard for international law is blowing up in the world's face.

  "<p>It is 8pm on a Tuesday evening, and I am busy annoying the Olympic associations of various Caribbean countries by asking them which national anthem will play if one of their athletes wins gold in Beijing. \"You want to know what?\" asks the receptionist at the Meat Market - a butcher that happens to share the same phone line as the Virgin Islands Olympic Committee.</p> <p>\"I just want to know if your athletes would listen to the US's anthem or that of the Virgin Islands.\"</p> <p>\"I don't know, son,\" she says. \"All I know is we ain't gonna win no gold medal.\"</p> <p>I have spent the last few weeks making calls like this because I have been trying to track down every single national anthem that might be heard at this year's Olympics. All 205 of them. My plan was to listen to all the anthems - the instrumental versions that you hear at the Olympics - with a music journalist's ear, and rank them; that way I would know who to cheer for. There is no other fair way to compare countries musically. National anthems are the same the world over - a short, classical piece meant to stir up pride. They have got to be boisterous and bombastic, with a tune simple enough that you can shout it whether drunk in a stadium, or drunk in front of the TV.</p> <p>Little did I know that it would take a month to track down four hours, 26 minutes and 25 seconds of music, or that most of those tunes would be so tedious I would have to limit myself to five a day to stop them putting me ofbrass for life. I also didn't expect the search to create in me an undying hatred for both La Marseillaise (versions of which are used by seven countries) and God Save the Queen (used by three).</p> <p>And what did I learn from all this? That there are only a dozen anthems that are musically worth listening to - and that most of the countries these belong to do not have a hope of winning a gold in Beijing.</p> <p>Anthems go back as far as the 1560s, when William of Orange's family decided he needed a song, Het Wilhelmus (\"The William\"), to accompany his exploits fighting for Dutch independence against the Spanish. It is a peaceful song - calming, even - with a winding melody. In short, it is everything an anthem shouldn't be, which is perhaps why no other country developed an anthem for a good two centuries. God Save the Queen was not performed until 1745, La Marseillaise until 1792, and what is now Germany's - music written by Haydn - until 1797.</p> <p>With colonialism, anthems spread world- wide, although most were not made official until the 1920s and 1930s. The first time they were used at the Olympics was 1924. But colonialism did not lead to every country adopting the hymns and military marches that pass for anthems in Europe. Three other types developed: folk anthems based on traditional melodies; \"the Arab fanfare\", common in Middle Eastern countries and consisting of little more than a trumpet flourish; and the Latin American \"epic anthems\".</p> <p>The last group are by far the most fun. Most of them last over four minutes and are set out like mini operas. They have a rollicking opening section, in which each part of the brass section tries to outplay the others, a melodramatic, meandering middle section - oboes and flutes dominate - and an over-the-top finish.</p> <p>All of which background is pretty irrelevant, as from listening to 205 of them I have realised there are actually just two types of anthem: the perfunctory, lifeless ones, and those that make the effort to be different. Shame that 190 fall into the first group.</p> <p>Antigua's, for example, is a school assembly tune, not an anthem, while Sri Lanka's sounds like a nursery rhyme. There are dull military marches such as Malta's and Burkina Faso's, and dull hymns like Zambia's and Malaysia's. Whoever wrote them seemed to be aiming solely for a tune simple enough that parents could teach it to their children on a recorder. </p> <p>The other big disappointment with the majority of anthems is that no matter which country they come from, they sound like they were written by a band leader from the Royal Navy. There are no cha-cha-cha rhythms in Cuba's anthem, no highlife guitars in Ghana's.</p> <p>\"There are historical reasons for this,\" says Derek Scott, professor of critical musicology at Leeds University. \"The UK's was the first real national anthem in 1745. And it was adopted by dozens of other countries: Sweden, Germany, even Russia at one point. The idea developed that it was only the words that were important in expressing national character. The tune to God Save the Queen was seen as meaning 'national anthem' and the words were what made it appropriate to each country.\"</p> <p>People know what a national anthem is supposed to sound like - a western military march - so they make sure theirs sounds the same. \"Countries use anthems to put themselves on the world stage,\" he says. </p> <p>In spite of this, there are a handful of anthems that do stand out - either because they use non-western instruments, scales and tunes, or because they take a western anthem and then toy with it, making it solemn or funny, and entirely their own. Most of the \"Stans\" of central Asia have anthems that sound like they could not have come from anywhere apart from former Soviet states. They trudge along in minor keys, filled with imposing strings and booming drums, as if written to accompany armies clambering into battle. </p> <p>Then there are Nepal's, Senegal's and Nigeria's, all of which make use of local instruments. Senegal's is even called \"Strum your koras, strike your balafons\" after the instruments that play it. Guinea's, a military march, inexplicably has a 10-second \"polka break\" halfway through. Burundi's does a similar trick, turning into the soundtrack from a Bruce Lee film for 10 seconds before realising that perhaps it wasn't the best idea after all.</p> <p>When you hear tunes like these, which are genuinely different and exciting - world music fans would be lapping them up if they didn't know they were anthems - it makes you wonder why others do not follow their example. But will you actually hear any of these at the Olympics? Well, Japan's should get several airings - look out, in particular, for Kosuke Kitajima in the 200m men's breast-stroke - but none of the others has actually won gold in either of the last two Olympics, so it's unlikely. \"We only have six athletes going to <br>Beijing and they didn't actually qualify,\" says a spokesman for Bangladesh's Olympic association. Surely, then, all the more reason to cheer them for their music.</p> <h2>Be Upstanding: The ten best national anthems</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Pq4HqHLkFM&amp;feature=related\">Uruguay: National anthem</a></p> <p>One of the most euphoric pieces of classical music I've ever heard.

I bought it for myself for my 30th birthday. </p> <p><strong>Is black always the new black?</strong></p> <p>Yes, absolutely. It's classic and flattering. I tend not to wear prints. Instead I wear solid colours with black. This skirt is from See by Chlo\u00e9's new autumn/winter collection. The jacket I have had since I was about 16. I got it in a little vintage shop in Margate, where I am from. I never throw things away. </p> <p><strong>Is this a typical work look? </strong></p> <p>Yes.

I tend to just scrape my hair back into a ponytail. It's really curly, but I blow-dry it straight about twice a week. And then makeup, I've never been seen without my mascara. Other than that, I don't wear tons of makeup. </p> <p><strong>Have you always dressed like this? </strong></p> <p>When I was at university, I used to wear a lot of patterned, mix-and-match stuff and generally be quite creative. I am more conventional now. </p> <p><strong>You must have to travel a lot for work. What do you pack when you're going away? </strong></p> <p>Even when I'm shooting in hot locations, I would never be seen in front of my crew in a bikini.

  "<p>A wave of a suicide bombings and police shootings left 11 people dead in western China yesterday, as Uighur Islamic separatists attempted to steal global attention from the Beijing Olympics.</p> <p>In what appears to be one of the most widely coordinated assaults in Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region in recent memory, the militants threw or carried homemade explosives into a dozen government sites in Kuqa city, killing a security guard, injuring two police officers, destroying two police cars and damaging trading and commerce offices.</p> <p>The separatists' most ambitious assault involved wheeling a tricycle laden with explosives into a public security bureau just before dawn. One attacker was shot, another blew himself up and two were captured, according to the state-run Xinhua news agency.</p> <p>Six hours later, police tracked down some of the alleged militants in the local marketplace. In the ensuing battle, two militants were reportedly shot and three blew themselves up with homemade bombs. One suspect is in detention. Another is in hospital, but at least six are thought to be at large. The entire Kuqa county, home to 400,000 people, has been cordoned off, business has been suspended, and paramilitaries with machine guns were patrolling the streets.</p> <p>The clashes came less than a week after Xinjiang witnessed the deadliest attack on Chinese security personnel in a decade. Last Monday, two alleged Muslim jihadists in Kashgar droved a lorry into a rank of jogging paramilitaries, then killed survivors with bombs and knives. The attack claimed 16 lives, and the authorities linked it to threats made earlier by three separatist groups who want to create an East Turkestan homeland for ethnic Muslim Uighurs in the region.</p> <p>On Thursday, the previously unknown Turkistan Islamic party released a video threat to attack buses, trains and airplanes during the Olympics.</p> <p>Kuqa is more than 1,850 miles from Beijing, but Olympic organisers have identified Uighur \"terrorists\" as the main threat to the games. Organisers sought to reassure athletes, journalists and tourists that yesterday's attack would not disrupt the sporting event. \"I do not believe this will have an impact on the Olympic games,\" Wang Wei, vice-president of the organising committee, told reporters.</p> <p>Exiled Uighur leader Rebiya Kadeer claimed that China is exaggerating the threat posed by separatist extremists as an excuse to impose its will on Xinjiang's the Muslim population and their peaceful campaign for more freedom. </p> <p>\"We advocate the principle of non-violence, and the promotion of freedom, democracy and human rights through peaceful means. We also sincerely hope for a peaceful Olympic games.\"</p> <p>She accused the Chinese authorities of a heavy handed crackdown in Kashgar and throughout East Turkestan in the name of the Olympics, saying that Uighurs have endured higher rates of execution and detention, forced relocation, police monitoring, passport confiscation, and the destruction of places of worship. Many Uighurs are unhappy that an influx of Han Chinese over the past 50 years has made them a minority in their homeland.</p> <p>Tibetan exile groups also continued to use the Beijing games to draw attention to what they say are human rights abuses in the Himalayan region.</p> <p>Five activists, including a Tibetan woman from Germany, Padma-Dolma Fielitz, were dragged from Tiananmen Square after displaying a Tibetan flag and a banner reading: \"Tibetans are dying for freedom\".</p> <p>The continuing unease among many Tibetan communities was highlighted by reports that two women were shot and wounded in Aba county town - the scene of some of the worst violence in March's wave of unrest. According to the Free Tibet Campaign, the shots came from a building that is being used as a Chinese barracks for military reinforcements sent into the area last month, apparently to ensure there are no protests during the Olympics.</p> <p>George Bush has used his visit to Beijing for last Friday's opening ceremony to raise the issue of religious freedom and improved human rights. Before meeting the Chinese president, Hu Jintao, and watching American swimmer Michael Phelps win gold in the 400-metre individual medley, the US president and his wife, Laura, attended a church service in Beijing to underline his message.</p> <p>\"You know, it just goes to show that God is universal, and God is love, and no state, man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion,\" he said, as parishioners exited the church.</p> <p>But the Chinese authorities remain concerned about extremist groups. More than 100,000 police and paramilitaries have been deployed in Beijing, along with 300,000 surveillance cameras in one of the biggest security operations mounted in China. They were unable, however, to prevent the apparently random murder on Saturday on the father-in-law of the US men's volleyball coach. </p> <p>Todd Bachman was stabbed to death, and his wife, Barbara, and a Chinese guide were seriously wounded in the attack at Beijing's 13th-century Drum Tower. The killer, Tang Yongming, leaped to his death after the attack. The motive remains a mystery. Tang - who recently retired from a job at a factory in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province - had arrived in Beijing on August 1. The 47-year-old, who divorced two years ago, had no criminal record.</p>",
  "<p>A good start, argued Doncaster's manager Sean O'Driscoll, can be measured only after 10 games. A poor one was apparent after 90 minutes in the face of Paul Jewell. Visibly downcast, the Derby manager was aware he will be judged not just on this anticlimactic defeat but on the 25 winless league games that comprise his reign at Pride Park.</p> <p>\"The wolves will be at the door already because of what happened last season,\" he said. \"I fully understand that. I'm not hiding from that. If I'd have taken the job in the summer and put together the team we've got today, people would be saying: 'It will take time.' I've been in the Championship for three years as a </p> <p>manager and won two promotions. The other time we finished seventh, so I think my record stands up to scrutiny. But for every player and every manager, you're only as good as your last game, so as far as that's concerned we're not very good.\"</p> <p>As the former Wigan manager said, Doncaster's lesser-known players deserved to win. Such refreshing honesty highlights the shortcomings of his own recruitment. Last season Derby's awful team was not of Jewell's making but after the exodus of the embarrassed, his summer signings had an awkward introduction. There were nine debutants on Saturday, of which the seven starters included the entire midfield and both forwards. Only the full-backs Tyrone Mears and Jay McEveley remained of Billy Davies' side. While that team was ruthlessly exposed in the Premier League, they had been a force in the Championship. The scale and speed of the change make this appear the sort of experiment normally conducted only in reality television shows. This is a quest for elevation with a cast of strangers. </p> <p>With the notable exception of Kris Commons, none provided an instant endorsement of Jewell's regime. A capacity crowd, displaying either extreme loyalty or a penchant for masochism, booed them off. \"We've got good players in that dressing room,\" Jewell insisted. With a string of past promotions, they are similarly strong on paper. Proving that on the <br>pitch, however, may be problematic. Saturday represented a victory for continuity over change. Of O'Driscoll's starting 11, only the club record purchase Matt Mills was not owned by Rovers last season; even he was on loan at the Keepmoat Stadium.</p> <p>Familiarity bred an understanding. Lewis Guy, who made a series of well-timed runs from deep positions, scored the only goal, Doncaster's first in the league's second tier for half a century. Devoid of an enforcer, O'Driscoll deployed his captain, Brian Stock, as the midfield anchor to counter Derby's target man Rob Hulse. Flick-ons were anticipated and possession retained enabling Doncaster, purveyors of precise passing, to exert control. \"We may have played Derby off the pitch at times,\" said the striker Gareth Taylor, something for a former Nottingham Forest player to savour.</p> <p>Aided by Stock and Richie Wellens, Doncaster were more assured on the ball than the hosts. Jewell, despite his 13 recruits, talked of midfield additions and, of course, of winning. Derby's search for that elusive victory continues when they face Lincoln City in the Carling Cup tomorrow.</p> <p>\"We need to get rid of the monkey,\" Jewell added. With the wolves at the door and the monkey on their back, even nature appears to be conspiring against the Rams.</p> <p><strong>Man of the match</strong> Brian Stock (Doncaster Rovers)</p>",
  "<p>The vast majority of the Craven Park faithful had turned up hoping to witness a rousing return for Paul Cooke, but instead were treated to a stand-off masterclass by his opposite number. Scott Hill was in magnificent form as Harlequins put a severe dent in Hull KR's play-off aspirations and kept their own hopes alive of making the top six.</p> <p>Hill had a willing ally in his captain Rob Purdham, who was outstanding throughout, kicking eight goals from as many attempts and drawing a glowing tribute from his coach, Brian McDermott.</p> <p>\"We are a massively different team when Rob is in,\" said McDermott. \"He doesn't just provide quantity stats but quality as well. Scott Hill also had a big influence on us today. Things just seemed to work for us; we looked in control.\"</p> <p>Harlequins' victory was built on a near faultless first half hour in which they established a 26-0 lead. They opened the scoring when the hooker Chad Randall went over by the posts, but it was down their left-hand side where they had the most success, with Hill and Purdham causing havoc in the home defence.</p> <p>Hill was involved twice and Purdham once in the slick handling move that resulted in the young wing Will Sharp scoring out wide to continue his recent prolific try-scoring run. Then Hill kicked cleverly for Purdham, who sent the Australian centre David Howell over in the same corner. Purdham kept the scoreboard ticking over with three conversions; a pattern he continued when Henry Paul forced his way over for a soft try. </p> <p>Rovers stirred after the restart, responding within a minute when Michael Dobson's kick ended with Jon Steel crossing out wide. But despite the emergence of Cooke on 45 minutes it was a false dawn and Gareth Haggerty's try for Quins, another from close range because of weak defence, ensured there would be no fairytale for Hull.</p> <p>Hill then crossed in similar fashion and even though Rovers scored the try of the match when Peter Fox took a quick tap restart and raced 80 metres to touch down and Dobson added another late on it could do little to mask what was a hugely disappointing afternoon for the home side. </p> <p>\"We just didn't turn up to play in the first half,\" said their coach, Justin Morgan. \"It was the lack of effort that worried me most. I sound like a broken record at times. I've said this plenty of times this season about conceding that many points and expecting to win games.\" Morgan's side now face an uphill battle to reignite their hopes of a place in the top six.</p> <p><strong>Hull Kingston Rovers</strong> Briscoe; Fox, Webster, Welham, Steel; Galea, Dobson; Crossman, Fisher, Mills, Vella, Gene, Cockayne. <strong>Interchange</strong> J Netherton, Cooke, K Netherton, Aizue</p> <p><strong>Harlequins</strong> Melling; Sharp, Clubb, Howell, Sheriffe; Hill, Orr; Ward, Randall, Haggerty, Grayshon, Purdham, Paul. <strong>Interchange</strong> Rinaldi, Temata, Heckenberg, McCarthy-Scarsbrook</p> <p><strong>Referee</strong> P Bentham (Warrington)</p>",
  "<p>Here's a news story guaranteed to provoke a fusillade of indignant spluttering, courtesy of your inner Clarkson: German politicians are reportedly planning to ban Kinder Surprise eggs on the grounds that they're a safety hazard.</p> <p>In case you're not familiar with the concept, the \"surprise\" inside each Kinder egg is a cheapo little toy housed within a plastic shell. Anyway, the Germans are worried that hungry, gurgling kiddywinks might mistake the gifts for food and wind up choking to death. \"Children can't differentiate between toys and nutritional items,\" said Miriam Gruss, a member of the German parliamentary children's committee.</p> <p>What, really? Don't get me wrong - I think children are idiots. But even I find that statement a tad unfair and sweeping. I used to have a spud gun when I was a kid. In case you're not familiar with that concept either, it was a small metal pistol that fired chunks of potato. Not once did I aim the potato at anyone. Or try to deep-fry the gun. And I was thick as shit. I guess it was luck.</p> <p>In fact my run of luck was pretty impressive. Other toys I failed to ingest include a Scalextric, several boxes of space Lego, the board games Operation and Mousetrap, and a complete collection of Paul Daniels' TV Magic Tricks - even though the latter included an egg-shaped gizmo called The Magic Egg. Somehow, miraculously, my conker-sized kiddywink brain managed to differentiate it from a real egg. Thus my life was saved by a whisker.</p> <p>Gruss won't countenance such a slapdash approach to child safety. Not on her watch. \"It's a sad fact,\" she said. \"Kinder Surprise eggs have to go.\"</p> <p>As you can imagine, the committee's proclamation has already caused a fair bit of outraged huffing, not least from the manufacturer, Ferrero, which until now has perhaps been best known for providing the catering at badly dubbed ambassadors' receptions in the late 1980s.</p> <p>\"There is absolutely no evidence that the Kinder Surprise eggs, as a combination of toy and foodstuff, are dangerous,\" said Ferrero's spokeswoman. Then she snatched a golden-foil-wrapped nobbly chocolate bollock from a nearby silver platter and added, \"Monsieur, with these Rocher, you are really spoiling us.\"</p> <p>Now I'm no fan of Ferrero chocolate, which vaguely tastes like regurgitated icing sugar to me, but I can't help thinking that it would be hugely unfair on the company if an unsubstantiated link between Kinder eggs and danger began to form in parents' minds and sales suffered accordingly. Let's face it, even though Kinder eggs are generally bought for the gift rather than the sickly chocolate shell, and even though many of the toys are so ingeniously designed they could easily be sold on their own, munching through the outside to get at the inedible inside is half the fun.</p> <p>What's more, jittery, neurotic parents don't need any more false scares to piss their pants over. They're already raising their twatty little offspring like mollycoddled prisoners: banned from playing outdoors in case a paedophile ring burrows through the pavement and eats them, locked indoors with nothing but anti-bacterial plasma screens for company, ferried to and from school in spluttering rollcaged tanks. . . Christ, half these kids would view choking to death as a release.</p> <p>No wonder they grow up to become tiresome whooping advocates for extreme sports. If I'd spent the first 18 years of my life doing time in a joyless cotton-wool cell, listening to some angsty bloody parent banging on about how precious and special I was every pissing day, I'd snowboard off a 300ft cliff at the first opportunity too. Under those circumstances, tumbling down a rockface and cracking your skull open must feel like a declaration of independence crossed with an orgasm.</p> <p>How did we get to this point? Our sense of self grew too strong. We gazed up our own bums for so long, we each became the centre of the universe. We're not mere specks of flesh, jostled by the forces of chance. We're flawless deities, and goddammit we deny - deny! - the very existence of simple bad luck. If we trip on the pavement, someone else is to blame. Of course they are. And we'll sue them to prove it if necessary.</p> <p>In a bid to pre-empt our self-important litigiousness, armies of risk assessors scan the horizon, dreaming of every conceivable threat. You could bang your head on that branch. Crack a rib on that teaspoon. Choke to death on that chocolate egg.</p> <p>Well, it stops here. And it stops now. Next week, I'm launching my own range of Kinder eggs. They're called Unkinder Eggs. And they don't contain sweets. They contain specially designed hazards. Spiked ball bearings. </p> <p>Spring-loaded razor-blade traps. Flimsy balloons filled with acid. Miniature land mines powerful enough to punch holes in your cheeks and embed your teeth in the wall. The idea is to carefully nibble away all the chocolate without incurring a serious injury. Thrills! Tension! Chocolate! It's the confectionery equivalent of extreme sports. You'll love it.</p> <p>And hey - that's not just cocoa butter and milk solids you're savouring. It's better than that. It's the great taste of risk.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>This week Charlie laughed at the glaring bum-awful rubbishness of <strong>Orange's current I Am Who I Am Because of Everyone advertising campaign</strong>, which somehow manages to be cloying, irritating, pretentious, irrelevant and baffling all at once: \"If ever an advert deserved a punch in the face, it's this one.\"</p>",
  "<p>As everyone knew it would be, Georgia's attempt to wrest control of the breakaway province of South Ossetia was short-lived. An offensive which began on Friday by pounding the heavily populated capital Tskhinvali with Grad missiles, heavy artillery and air strikes ended last night in ignominious retreat, followed by an order for a complete ceasefire. Grigory Karasin, Russia's deputy foreign minister, said more than 2,000 people had died in the onslaught, and 30,000 had been forced to abandon their homes, although there was no independent confirmation of these figures. But it was a bit late for Georgian leaders to be expressing regret for loss of human life.</p> <p>Russia, however, lost no time in shedding whatever moral advantage it felt it had by bombing Georgian targets - civilian as well as military - far removed from the zone of conflict. Russian bombs fell on blocks of flats, an aircraft factory and the Black Sea port of Poti, and just missed the oil pipeline from Baku. Its fleet blockaded Georgian shipping and landed troops in Abkhazia. That separatist government declared mobilisation, saying it intended to push Georgian forces out of the Kodori Gorge, the only part of the province under Georgian control. If Russia's entry into Georgian territory was motivated solely by the need to protect Ossetian lives, as Moscow claimed it was, what was it doing bombing Georgian towns? Or was this an act of collective punishment?</p> <p>This has been a lose-lose conflict from the start. The chief loser is the Georgian president, Mikheil Saakashvili, a man who gambled that Russia would not take South Ossetia back, and lost. The reunification of Georgia was central to his presidency, and yet he has now lost more territory than he has won. He elbowed out an unpleasant though essentially local Russian-backed potentate in Adjara. But he has now lost South Ossetia for good, and may well face a military strike from Abkhazia. </p> <p>This is the second time in living memory that Georgia has tried to take South Ossetia back by force. However complex the relationship between the Georgians and the Ossetians may have been before August 7 - there are many mixed families - it is less complicated now. Even discounting Russia's dark manoeuvring, Ossetians will not forgive Georgia for the destruction of their towns and villages. When the dust has settled, the political opposition in Tbilisi may well grow as a result of Mr Saakashvili's military defeats.</p> <p>Russia, too, has paid a price. A military invasion of the sovereign territory of a neighbour has shaken the entire region, not least Ukraine, which \"reserved the right\" to bar Russian ships from returning to their base in the Crimea. This has reopened the conflict over the use of Sevastopol as the base for the Black Sea fleet. A weekend of ever more specific statements culminated in a White House warning that Russian actions could have a \"significant, long-term impact\" on US-Russian relations. So far the US has countered Russian objections to missile defence bases in Poland and the Czech Republic by saying the installations are not aimed at them, but at Iran. A future US president may be tempted to switch tack and argue that a radar that monitors most of Russia's airspace is needed after all. </p> <p>The Georgian experience has hardened European opinion against Russia, especially in France and Germany, the two European powers who had prevented the Nato conference in Bucharest from awarding Georgia and Ukraine membership action plans. This does not suit Russia's strategic or oil interests. On the contrary, it was doing quite nicely by playing on Europe's divisions. Above all, this short war should be an object lesson to those in Europe and Nato who dangle the prospect of security guarantees that they can not deliver on. It would have been safer to have admitted the limits of western influence.</p>",

I find they keep me warm in my pension years!</strong></p> <p><strong>Mrs Mildred Dawes</strong>, Twickenham, London</p> <p>And so do I, Mrs Mildred, so do I! (Sorry readers, but Mrs Dawes and I are in agreement on this matter: such is the gravity of the subject that an exclamation mark is necessary.) To wit, a hooded top keeps one warm, keeps one cosy and, most importantly, keeps one's blow-dry protected from the elements without recourse to an easily misplaced hat or umbrella. Perhaps only the Eames chair can rival the hooded top for its simple but ingenious design.</p> <p>Yet this precious little garment has been kidnapped (hoodnapped) by thuggish youths and become sartorial shorthand for this objectionable demographic, with their music-playing mobiles and their grunting ways.</p> <p>Hoodie lovers, unite!

Who is this Peaches Geldof anyway?</strong></p> <p><strong>Robert Mortenson</strong>, by email</p> <p>Who indeed? There is a rumour - a highly credible one, to my mind - that Peaches Geldof does not actually exist. That's right, my friends: she is actually a totally made-up concept coined by the tabloids to fill the role of \"party blonde\" now that previous contenders have either gone a bit quiet (Chantelle) or a bit too car crash-y (Kerry Katona). Basically, she is a mass-media experiment, like Truman in The Truman show, except that she doesn't actually exist at all: no flesh, no blood, just a mere hologram cooked up by the holy trinity of News International, the Mirror Group and Grazia magazine. I mean, think about it: how many of you have seen Peaches Geldof walking down the street, queuing up at your local Asda? Well, there you go then. </p> <p>But this is by the bye. The real issue here is what qualifications one needs to be a fashion icon and, seeing as I suspect you saw this term applied to Ms Geldof in a tabloid, Mr Mortenson, that has very specific components. In short, despite what the name might suggest, one is not required to be an icon to be dubbed with the title. One does not even have to have any half-decent fashion sense. All one needs is to go to at least 47 pointless PR launch parties a week and to be readily available to appear on T4, Channel 4's increasingly terrible weekend morning slot. Didn't have a hangover when you started watching? You will now! </p> <p>So, as you can see, Peaches more than qualifies for the title, so much so that one could even call her \"the fashion icon of her generation\", nay, \"of her age\". Oh boy, Robert, I bet you are shaking your head with a rueful laugh at your foolish cynicism now, aren't you? Because the truth is, one doesn't even really need the above qualifications for the role of \"fashion icon\" any more: one just needs to wear clothes in the public eye. Hence the disparate likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, any off-duty model and Samantha Cameron all being anointed with the label in the past few days. But then, this proves the point, really, at least in the first example. </p> <p>Ronaldo was also described recently in one ever so down-market Sunday tabloid (I have to read it - it's for work, and a weekly degradation it is, too) as \"the most gorgeous man on the planet\", an opinion that is decidedly more subjective than factual, and only really holds true among the very select group of women on this planet who like their men to resemble Peter Andre.

Across a tatty croquet lawn, a few bespectacled men in shorts and women in summer skirts are politely shuffling between the sausage queue and a table of beer, sharing anecdotes and holiday tales and discussing the week at work.</p> <p>They may not look much like media visionaries, but these people help determine what we listen to, what we view and what we read. And they all work here, in Kingswood Warren - the BBC's main research and development centre, nestled among footballers' mansions and parkland. Since the department was established in 1948, the staff of this grand old building have helped develop colour TV, FM and stereo radio, Ceefax, satellite broadcasting, high-definition TV, digital radio and Freeview. They have also had a hand in the production techniques bringing the Beijing Olympics alive for viewers, and the first international broadcast of ultra-high definition TV - which looks set to blow your socks off. </p> <p>But this is Kingswood Warren's final summer as the home of invention and innovation - after 60 years, the 151 R&amp;D staff will begin leaving in November for a new home in White City, and a third of those will move again with the future media department to Salford. And as the Kingswood era ends, staff members are wondering if this is the beginning of the end of their department, too. There is a palpable sense of gloom: \"Someone went to Kingswood Warren, saw a country estate near Gatwick and decided it must be worth a packet,\" bemoans one. </p> <p><strong>Academic ethos</strong></p> <p>Which may leave some saying: so what if they did? Why should the BBC house its staff in stately homes? But that is to ignore the fertile, academic ethos of the place, two hours and a world away from the politics and bureaucracy of White City. </p> <p>The slightly dilapidated exterior of the building also belies its real power. Kingswood sits on a formidable technical infrastructure - it is one of a handful of buildings in the country with a direct \"dark fibre\" or large-capacity link to the UK's central internet hub at Telehouse in Docklands. One staff member sneers at the \"asset-stripping\" decision to sell the building to the residential developer Octagon, instead of a sale to a company such as Google that might appreciate Kingswood's set-up.</p> <p>So why is the BBC selling up? Is it money? The corporation rejected a previous freedom of information request to disclose the value of the site, but neighbouring properties with a tenth of the land and a fraction of the floorspace sell for up to \u00a34m. \"We want R&amp;D to operate closer with our colleagues so we can ... show how technology can help them and spark creative autonomy,\" says the acting head of broadcast research for BBC Research &amp; Innovation, Andy Bower.</p> <p>The technical infrastructure will be replicated in White City, where both BBC Property and Siemens - which bought BBC Technology in 2004 - started work this month, and eventually at Salford's MediaCityUK. \"The network will be just as large,\" says Bower. \"We're not slimming it down at all - far from it. The broadcast world is changing and will continue to change, so the expectation is that the future media department will grow.\" </p> <p>That is if Kingswood staff make the move. Bower acknowledges that relocation (or a long commute) might not appeal to some, many of whom have served 25, 35 or 45 years and are close to retirement. \"I hope we don't lose too many,\" he says. \"The key thing is the quality and scope of work that staff can undertake - that's what gets them out of bed every day. Hopefully that will get better.\"</p> <p>But morale is low. One staffer says that, while the team had been willing to embrace changes at the start, they have been left demoralised by poor management and continual changes over the details of a move that will see them \"squashed into a corner of London W12\". Another expresses concern that the weight of staff numbers will drop below a critical mass. They are worried the department will shrink, like the BBC's defunct design department, until it no longer has the resources to tackle significant projects and will then be axed.</p> <p><strong>Managing decline</strong></p> <p>The problems started in 2004 with the sale of BBC Technology to Siemens, the departure of the R&amp;D head Peter Bury and a subsequent perceived power battle between Ashley Highfield, the recently departed director of future media and technology, and John Varney, the former chief technology officer, over control of the division. Once Varney had left, staff were unimpressed by the calibre of the executives recruited to oversee R&amp;I for the next four years. Bury's role was split into two jobs, head of broadcast research and head of future media research - but neither has yet been appointed. There is also no overall controller for the whole R&amp;I department.\"The place desperately needs good leadership or it will fall apart,\" says one staffer, \"and major projects such as digital switchover will be in danger.\"</p> <p>\"Andy Bower is just managing decline,\" says another employee, attributing concern over the Kingswood Warren closure to 10% inevitable change and 90% incompetence. \"It's soul-destroying for a group of people so dedicated to their work. </p> <p>\"The Siemens deal broke that culture ... it was the demise of doing something because it is for the public good. Siemens do things for the good of Siemens, not for the good of the BBC or the public.\"</p> <p>Kingswood today is a strange place; beyond the croquet lawns and grand oak doors are a series of offices, outhouses, laboratories and even an anechoic chamber - an echoless room used for audio experiments. Get locked in there and no one will ever hear you scream.</p> <p>The loudest voices at the BBC belong to people who work in TV, but there are many more we don't hear - the pioneering engineers, scientists and mathematicians. The rest of the media industry, and the web 2.0 world in particular, are preoccupied with keeping up and spinning the new - but Kingswood is a thing apart, imagining our future 20 years from now.</p> <p>\"This is an unacceptable way to manage a world-class part of the BBC,\" says one furious member of staff. \"There are only two centres in the world recognised as being leaders in the academic and industrial fields of research in broadcasting, and they are NHK in Japan and BBC R&amp;D in Surrey. Soon there will be only one.\"</p> <p><strong>Kingswood innovations</strong></p> <p><strong>HDTV</strong> Engineers are working on super-HD in collaboration with Japan's public broadcaster, NHK, experimenting with screens up to 300in wide.

  "<p>Robert Mugabe and Morgan Tsvangirai were locked in make-or-break talks last night over how power will be distributed in a coalition government aimed at ending Zimbabwe's deepening political and economic crisis. </p> <p>The two sides have reached broad agreement that Mugabe will remain president and Tsvangirai will be prime minister at the head of a large cabinet divided evenly between their two parties, but with a smaller opposition faction holding the balance of posts.</p> <p>Sources close to the talks, mediated by South Africa's president, Thabo Mbeki, said there remained significant differences over key issues that will decide whether Mugabe retains real control of the government, in effect overturning Tsvangirai's victory in the March presidential election. </p> <p>Mbeki was pushing for an agreement that would not only resolve Zimbabwe's crisis but permit him to claim that his strategy of quiet diplomacy, derided in the west as a failure, was ultimately successful.</p> <p>In June, Mbeki proposed that Mugabe remain as a titular president, after 28 years in total control, with executive powers transferred to Tsvangirai as prime minister. Mugabe went into yesterday's meeting determined not to cede most of his powers, while Tsvangirai argued that he won a mandate to govern from the people in the March election - the last one widely considered to be largely legitimate. </p> <p>Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) said before the talks that while it would accept Mugabe in a ceremonial role, if he were to retain significant powers it would reward his Zanu-PF party's campaign of killings, beatings, abductions and rapes that broke opposition support in a second round of elections in June.</p> <p>Among the other issues in dispute is the composition of the cabinet. Mugabe wants it to have 36 ministers, with Zanu-PF and the MDC holding 15 seats each and the remaining six held by a breakaway faction of the MDC headed by Arthur Mutambara. Tsvangirai wants a smaller cabinet and Mutambara to have only two seats. </p> <p>Zanu-PF is keen for a large number of cabinet seats in part because party leaders see sitting in government as a means of perpetuating their patronage and ensuring they are not prosecuted for past crimes. </p> <p>There is also wrangling over who will hold the most powerful portfolios. The MDC is anxious to control the ministries that oversee the police and intelligence services, believing that they are the key to ensuring that future elections are free and fair after the two organisations were roped in to the violent and bloody state-orchestrated campaign against opposition supporters. </p> <p>Tsvangirai is less concerned about winning control over the army, which the opposition believes will be loyal to the government of the day.</p> <p>The two parties also disagree over how long the incoming administration will serve. The MDC wants it to sit for about two years, during which a new constitution will be written and elections held. </p> <p>Zanu-PF favours a government serving a full five-year term, in part because if another ballot is held in the near future the party is likely to suffer a devastating defeat, while several years from now Zimbabweans may be less enamoured of the MDC, after they have seen it in power. </p> <p>Tsvangirai holds a number of important cards in the talks. There will be no significant financial aid from the west to stabilise Zimbabwe's economy amid hyperinflation expected to rise to 50,000,000% this month, without a significant shift in power to the MDC leader. Britain, the US and the EU have all said that a \u00a31bn aid package will only be released if Mugabe relinquishes control of the government.</p> <p>It could also be argued that Mbeki needs an agreement as much as Tsvangirai in order to justify his much-criticised Zimbabwe policy and regain some of his rapidly eroding political credibility at home. </p> <p>Some of those who have backed Tsvangirai fear he may be desperate to become prime minister and give too much away. </p> <p>The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions, which Tsvangirai once headed and which gave birth to the MDC, has criticised the fact that negotiations take place behind closed doors with only political parties present. It said the talks should \"reflect the will of the people of Zimbabwe and not self-seeking, power-sharing agendas\".</p> <p>\"Zimbabwe is not made up of supporters of Zanu-PF and MDC alone, but a plethora of groupings which have to be consulted if the process is to gain wider acceptance by the majority,\" it said last month when talks were announced.</p> <h2>Backstory</h2> <p>Zimbabwe's political negotiations come against a background of <strong>rapid economic collapse</strong>, driven by hyper-inflation, which brought large parts of the country to the brink of starvation. The government officially puts <strong>inflation</strong> at 2,200,000% but economists say that it was closer to 10,000,000% last month and they estimate it will rise to about 50,000,000% in August. This month, the central bank removed 10 zeros from the Zimbabwe dollar because rapid <strong>devaluation</strong> had dragged it to Z$1.5tn to the pound. The currency has continued to implode, losing half of its value in a week. The World Food Programme warned that up to 5.1 million Zimbabweans - nearly one third of the population - will need <strong>food aid</strong> this year because the economic crisis and the redistribution of formerly white-owned farms has led to a collapse in crop production.</p>",

You sit there all day staring out the window with no one to talk to,\" she said. \"I thought it would be lovely to give a home and family life to one or two people who would otherwise be sitting around there.

Now every book that sells will help towards making a home for someone.\"</p> <p>Page has been writing since she first learned to hold a pencil as a child in the Devon port of Bideford, but seldom ventured publicly beyond poems and magazine articles. </p> <p>She wrote A Dangerous Weakness three years ago, but put it in a suitcase and made no attempt to find a publisher until her daughter-in-law told her: \"This is fantastic. It's bound to sell.\"</p> <p>The book has been published in both hardback and paperback. Page, who taught Morse code to the Air Training Corps during the second world war, is working on a sequel collection of short stories.</p> <p>The grandmother of two, whose name was previously known to publishing only as one of 55 pseudonyms of the veteran pulp writer, 80-year-old Donald S Rowland, said: \"I've always written. It seems I've been writing for a hundred years.\" This will be true in less than seven years time, particularly as Page said that her housing plan had given her a new lease of life.</p> <p>\"I started asking people if they wanted to move out of their care homes and live with me and I've had dozens of offers. They are queuing up,\" she said.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The following clarification was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Friday August 15 2008. In common with most other papers we reported that 93-year-old Lorna Page, \"suddenly prosperous on the advance and sales\" of her novel A Dangerous Weakness, had been able to buy a big detached house for herself and three of her friends. Aspiring writers (and housebuyers) should note that her publisher, AuthorHouse, is a self-publishing company whose website states: \"For a modest financial investment you can choose what you want for your book.\"</p>",
  "<p>Millionaires and Hollywood stars visiting Italy have been put on notice that they no longer own the beach after a group of celebrities led by Flavio Briatore, co-owner of QPR football club, were pelted with wet sand and showered with water as they tried to land dinghies on a crowded Sardinian beach.</p> <p>Already victims of shrinking spending power and sky-rocketing rates for renting deckchairs, Italians have descended on their beaches this August in a surly mood, and the sight of the Briatore-led flotilla as it carved a swath through alarmed swimmers was enough to spark a near riot on Friday at the packed Capriccioli beach. </p> <p>The Italian newspaper La Stampa seized on the episode as the start of a fightback against celebrities flaunting their wealth on the country's top beaches, stating: \"From north to south, the rebellion against those who show off their money and power is growing.\"</p> <p>The authorities also appear to be clamping down. Last week, Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones came ashore from their yacht at the Italian resort of Santa Margherita Ligure, the same spot where locals were kept awake in June by thumping music from Wayne Rooney's rented yacht. After failing to notify the coastguard of the names of all the members of the landing group, the captain of Douglas's yacht was fined \u00a31,600 under immigration and anti-terrorism legislation. </p> <p>Hostilities erupted in Sardinia when Briatore, the manager of the Renault formula one team, came ashore from a yacht to inaugurate his new restaurant, which opened on Friday just behind the beach and is close to his opulent disco Billionaire, a bastion of the super-rich. </p> <p>Briatore and his new bride, the TV showgirl Elisabetta Gregoraci, were met with grumbling from sunbathers as they hopped off the first dinghy, rising to whistles and shouts when the Italian newsreader Emilio Fede climbed off the second, while \"terrorised children wailed between the waves\", reported La Stampa. </p> <p>Yelling \"Shame! Louts! Go home!\", a mob formed to greet the third dinghy, attempting to push it back out to sea, as mothers filled their children's buckets with water to sling at the passengers and wet sand bombs were hurled. </p> <p>The episode marked a tough homecoming for Briatore, who has enjoyed an extended honeymoon since his star-studded Rome wedding in June. \"We are nice people and we get rewarded like this,\" Corriere della Sera quoted Briatore as saying after he returned to the beach to find out why his guests were being drenched. \"I will close down everything,\" he warned. \"I pay taxes, this is my right.\"</p> <p>With his new restaurant designed as a lunch stop for passing mega-yachts, Briatore may be wondering how Arab princes and Russian oligarchs will react to lobbed sand. But a Billionaire spokesman hinted that all may be in hand: \"This year we are opening the restaurant, but from next year we will manage the beach as well.\"</p>",
  "<p>Traders are braced for heavy falls in oil and commodity prices this week, heralding the end of the so-called commodities boom, after the US dollar posted its biggest one-day gain against the euro for eight years on Friday.</p> <p>Analysts said the spread of economic contagion beyond the US has reduced demand expectations for commodities and interest rate forecasts, especially for the eurozone, which makes other currencies less attractive against the dollar.</p> <p>Last week's comments from Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the European Central Bank, that third-quarter growth in the eurozone will be \"particularly weak\" was taken to mean interest rates will be held or even reduced. That would narrow the gap between interest rates in the US and Europe, which helped fuel the dollar's decline.</p> <p>The euro suffered its biggest one-day drop since December 2000 on Friday, falling below $1.50 at one point . The euro has lost 10 cents in the past few weeks.</p> <p>Against the pound, meanwhile, the dollar pulled back to just under $1.92, its strongest performance since November 2006. Currency traders will be watching this week's economic data in the UK for further signs of weakness and the potential for rate cuts. Weakness in the Japanese economy also saw the dollar strengthen against the yen.</p> <p>The dollar's strength has been boosted by declines in the oil price on expectations that the weakening global economy will see demand fall, with traders switching their funds out of oil futures and into the foreign exchange market. Oil has declined 21% from its early-July peak of $147.27 a barrel. The weakness in the oil market also helped US shares on Friday with the Dow Jones Industrial Average shooting up more than 300 points.</p> <p>Investment bank Lehman Brothers said last week that oil prices have peaked for the next few years as supplies increase and demand drops. China, for instance, has ended its inventory building ahead of the Olympics while Saudi Arabia has upped supplies.</p> <p>The investment bank said in a note to clients: \"In our view, the recent correction in oil prices was overdue and softness awaits in the next 12 months.\"</p> <p>Speculators have been abandoning oil and those who remain in the market are taking short positions, according to traders, betting that the crude price has further to fall.</p> <p>Paradoxically, the strengthening dollar is likely to exacerbate traders' desire to get out of other commodities even though they are priced in the US currency, so on the face of it should rise in value.</p> <p>Many commodity speculators, whom some economists blame for keeping prices high, have been pulling out of the market in recent weeks as it has become more obvious that the global economy is cooling and therefore demand will tail off and prices decline. Any short-term support in commodity prices provided by the strong dollar will give them the chance to get out even faster, accelerating declines in the price of metals and soft commodities.</p> <p>The Jefferies-Reuters CRB index, which tracks commodities across the globe, plunged 10% last month, its biggest drop since 1980.</p>",
  "<p>Unusually for a high-flyer in the civil service, Sir David Serpell, who has died aged 96, made his public reputation after retiring. His Whitehall career over, Serpell made the front pages in 1983 as author of a controversial report on the sorry state of the British rail network.</p> <p>As an official in the Ministry of Transport, Serpell claimed (in a radio interview) to have persuaded Richard Beeching to become chairman of the British Railways Board in 1961. Serpell himself joined British Rail's board (1974-82) after retiring as a permanent secretary. That (incestuous) closeness between the ministry and the industry did not extend to the Treasury, where Serpell had served, or No 10, which never much liked trains. Indeed Serpell's career was not just bound up with the railways, it calibrated their decline. His \"hatchet job\" of a report was one of the last official expressions of anti-rail thinking. Serpell survived into a 21st century that prizes rail not as a problem, but the solution to environmental and economic problems.</p> <p>Nothing in Serpell's background prefigured a connection with the railways. He was born to an affluent West Country family, a link which haunted him when his rail report was published with maps showing no line surviving west of Exeter. His father was a solicitor in Plymouth who supported not just an undergraduate education, at Exeter College, Oxford, but several years of high-class roaming as an assistant at a Nazi-era school and a student at universities in France and the US, where he met his first wife, Anne Dooley, the daughter of a professor. They married in 1938 and were divorced in 1971.</p> <p>Bright enough to enter the civil service with ease on his return to the UK in 1937, Serpell moved on and up, establishing his career as wartime private secretary to Gwilym Lloyd George, the Independent Liberal who became minister of fuel, light and power in 1942. Blooded, as high flyers were (and still are) by a spell at the Treasury, beginning in 1945, he became a deputy secretary (now grade 2) at the Ministry of Transport in 1960 just as the prime minister, Harold Macmillan, was saying a rail network created in the 19th century had to adapt to a country where a third of families now owned a car. In 1963 Serpell was a member of an official committee on a tunnel under the Channel.</p> <p>With time out at the Board of Trade and the Treasury in the fraught months prior to sterling devaluation, Serpell became permanent secretary at transport in 1968, presiding, in 1970, over its merger into the portmanteau Department of the Environment. </p> <p>The former Labour MP Tam Dalyell has claimed that Serpell was uncomfortable about delivering Beeching's cuts because he was a believer in the environmental importance of railways. But it is difficult with any civil service career to attribute specific contributions by an individual to policy. Serpell was a Treasury official when a culture of under-investment in rail was engendered. Did he have anything personally to do with the introduction of breath-testing for motorists beyond issuing a circular to departmental officials telling them not to drink and drive? </p> <p>Even once papers are released under the 30-year rule, it is rare to find an individual mandarin's finger prints. This friend of Beeching had, earlier in the 1950s, negotiated terms for the supply of Iranian oil, only shortly before the deposition of the Tehran government with American help: conspiracy theorists start here.</p> <p>Whitehall has a way of looking after its own, and after his retirement in 1972, Serpell went on to chair a quango, the Nature Conservancy Council. In 1978, he was commissioned by Peter Shore, the Labour environment secretary, to conduct a review of Ordnance Survey. Worth re-reading in the light of modern arguments about the ownership of cartographic data, his report missed the boat when the incoming Thatcher government decided to make Ordnance Survey an arm's length body with commercial objectives.</p> <p>Personally, Serpell was regarded as a stickler for the rules - one of his senior colleagues said he was a martinet. Railways seize the imaginations of many, but Serpell was never accused of flights of fancy. Michael Heseltine, a junior environment minister who could be accused of many flights of fancy, blamed Serpell for trying to turn him into a training machine for callow graduate entrants to the civil service instead of furnishing his private office with experienced doers. But sometimes doers need to be fended off, for the sake of orderly and fair government. Serpell's protege at environment, Ian Bancroft, was sacked by Margaret Thatcher for not toeing the line.</p> <p>Serpell's reputation was damaged by his rail review. Sir Peter Parker, the then chairman of British Rail, had long wanted a strategic view of the network's future - he was after something Serpell said officials had sought for decades and never found: public objectives for the public transport system. The Thatcherites, especially special adviser Alan Walters, wanted to cut and privatise. The secretary of state, David Howell, stood haplessly in between. </p> <p>Serpell, though he had worked on an alternative investment strategy as a member of the BR board, was not the first choice as a review chair. (Amazingly, the Liberal leader David Steel had been considered.) Serpell offered a traditional civil service approach - the neutral presentation of options, however outlandish - which in the circumstances was inadequate. The membership of his panel was rigged; Howell prevaricated over how long-term it should be; British Rail, its survival and high public interest at stake, plotted and leaked. </p> <p>Commissioned in May 1982 in the midst of strikes, Serpell reported at Christmas. Before then and publication in late January 1983, the Guardian published juicy excerpts from a study envisaging (but not recommending) sawing off chunks from the national network. Serpell did not seem aware, or to care, that an options review in such political circumstances was never going to be the academic exercise his background and demeanour fitted him for. A cartoon in the Sunday Times showed Parker pulling the switch to send a Thomas-style locomotive with Serpell's face (he had a striking resemblance to Roy Jenkins) into the sidings. A botched privatisation aside, the subsequent history of British railways has been about increased demand, new construction and almost Victorian levels of optimism.</p> <p>Serpell, who was knighted in 1968, married his second wife, Doris Farr, in 1972. She died in 2004. He is survived by the three sons of his first marriage.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> David Radford Serpell, civil servant, born November 10 1911; died July 28 2008</p>",
  "<p><strong>Panorama</strong><br>8.30pm, BBC1</p> <p>Though rubbish is a political issue like never before - specifically the disposal and recycling of household waste - there's little political will to tackle litter. Smitten with Britain when he arrived in 1972, Bill Bryson now fumes at the mess we're in and travels from London to Liverpool via country lanes, filthy flyovers and farmland, to investigate why, and what can be done but isn't. Armed with some fantastic statistics, Bryson does better with the latter than the former as the public has a hypocritical attitude to litter: professing to loathe it but dropping it nonetheless.

Though it no longer has the industry that was once its heartbeat and its proximity to Leeds now works against it, the West Yorkshire town has \u00a3100,000 of Channel 4's money to kickstart a rebirth - along with the attentions of competing architects and engineers. Whether that's sufficient to defibrillate the place is doubtful, but the experiment makes for rewarding viewing. </p> <p><strong><br>Mark Lawson Talks to GF Newman</strong><br>11.20pm, BBC4</p> <p>As the man behind the seminal and controversial Law and Order series of dramas from 1978, which showed corruption within the police and the legal system, Gordon Frank has been a force in British television for decades.

  "<p>These are not sanguine times for American newspapers. \"Reductions in force\" (RIF) sweep through our cubicles like the Black Death. And, while this plague affects both national and provincial papers, it seems most dire at regional dailies such as my own, threatening publications' curtailment or extinction. </p> <p>I recently succumbed to the reaper's scythe at the Orlando Sentinel. The paper is part of the Tribune Company, owners of the Chicago Tribune (which last month shed 80 newsroom jobs), Los Angeles Times (150 newsroom jobs) and Baltimore Sun (55 newsroom jobs), among others. </p> <p>In the run-up to the latest round of cuts, the subject naturally consumed every discussion among my colleagues; there were hushed conversations in the corridors and rumour-laden emails flying between staffers. With near-unbearable stress, sleepless nights and rollercoaster emotions, the gloom was both palpable and inescapable. Despite everyone's best efforts, parties had a fin de si\u00e8cle feel.</p> <p><strong>Decision time </strong></p> <p>First came the redundancy offers. Journalists frantically calculated how long their severance packages would last before deciding whether to accept the company's offer (I declined). To complicate matters, top editors were deliberately vague about how many layoffs would follow the voluntary departures, and what the criteria for them would be. </p> <p>Employees had two scenarios - why they would and wouldn't get RIFed. I weighed it up: on the one hand, I was a target as I was at the upper end of the salary range; on the other, my beat - religion - was important to my Southern readers. Plus, I have a national profile, have won prizes and written three books.</p> <p>Backup \"Plan B\"s abounded. Everything from writing books and seeking university posts to more dire prospects, such as becoming a colourfully-vested Wal-Mart greeter. Our pop music critic joked, with gallows humour, that he could always return to his first job of decades ago: piloting Disney World's Jungle Cruise. </p> <p>At increasingly grim staff meetings in the newsroom, details emerged. We turned editors' percentage targets into hard numbers and, inevitably, began looking around the room. Finally, in order to provide a fig leaf of dignity, both the \"voluntaries\" and the \"involuntaries\" were called in one at a time to supervisors' glass-walled offices to receive the news. There were some surprises, some tears, and no official list was posted. </p> <p>Because I was headed for a vacation outside the country, I came in the week before to see my boss, and got the bad news face-to-face: I was out. Kicking me from the newspaper nest might turn out to be a good thing, I rationalised. I had my own Plan B firmly in place: to finally finish a book I have been working on for 13 years. But regardless of how well-prepared you think you are, the prospect of the job chop is one thing; the reality quite another. </p> <p>How - and why - have American newspapers come to such a death spiral? Nationally, every quarterly report shows significant drops in newspaper advertising sales and circulation - with no bottom in sight. Ink-on-newsprint is imploding at an accelerating rate; the only thing rising is our readers' average age. </p> <p>Despite a monopoly market, papers in the normally prosperous American Sunbelt have gone from double-digit annual returns to the precipice of profitability. Notwithstanding the Florida real estate market's dramatic downturn (exacerbated by the sub-prime mortgage crisis), the state's newspapers are still making money. In the case of Tribune dailies, it's just not enough to service the crushing debt load resulting from the highly-leveraged buyout that took the company private.</p> <p>The response has been to talk about transformation but then to default to traditional austerity measures, cutting thousands of newsroom jobs across the country. A Baltimore Sun writer observed recently that her social life seems to revolve around colleagues' leaving parties. Regional papers have jettisoned national and international coverage, except where strong local interest exists (Cuba and Israel in Miami; Ireland in Boston). We shrink paper size; experiment with \"alternative story forms\"; create frenetic redesigns. </p> <p>Our stories got shorter, simpler and more intensely local - always with a sharp eye toward how they would be illustrated, sometimes with heartbreaking results. Major stories can turn into \"charticles\". This is not why most of us got into this business. Does all this sound desperate? It gets worse. Some papers have changed the title of marketing directors to \"Innovation Officer,\" resulting in some cases in a barrage of high-octane memos that can read like manic, barely coherent musing.</p> <p><strong>Saturation point</strong></p> <p>In part, the fault is in the stars - which is to say, in the changes in culture which have produced such a media-saturated environment. But the fault is also in the newspapers being produced. Grown complacent - fat, dumb and happy - the industry became boring and irrelevant.</p> <p>The great minds that lead us missed two significant internet threats. Craigslist and eBay have gobbled up our classified advertising goldmine; and newspaper strategists chose a business model based on giving away our information rather than finding a way to extract some revenue for it. Both developments have been financially disastrous.</p> <p>There's also a problem we cannot control. Journalism's statesmen and academics may differ, but many reporters have concluded that the fault is neither in our stars, nor in ourselves - but in our audience. Middle-aged readers say other media now trump newspapers.

  "<p>In last Tuesday's Daily Mail, the lead letter, from the Federation of Poles in Great Britain, was headlined \"Poles feel persecuted\". The writer, Wiktor Moszczynski, complained about \"newspaper coverage emphasising negative aspects of the Polish presence in the UK\". Poles were linked to problems in the NHS and schools, unemployment among Britons, drug smuggling, rape and so on. They felt humiliated and vulnerable; \"hundreds of hate crimes against Poles, some leading to injury or death\" had been recorded.</p> <p>The letter did not name any offending newspaper and Mail readers could be forgiven for wondering why it was there, on a letters page that, as in most downmarket papers, is tucked away between TV listings and sport. In fact, it follows a long dispute between Moszczynski and the Mail and his letter (a longer version ran on the Mail's website) is part of a resolution brokered by the Press Complaints Commission. Though other newspapers run stories portraying Poles and other Eastern European migrants in a bad light - for example, Moszczynski has reported a Times column to the PCC - the Mail is by far the most consistent offender. Moszczynski's complaint listed 80 headlines since May 2006, but a trawl through the Mail online archive suggests he could have included many more.</p> <p>Most of the stories were newsworthy and largely accurate. The objection is to the way they are presented and the drip, drip effect of continually highlighting the Polish connection. As Moszczynski puts it, they \"ensure that the average Daily Mail reader's heart skips a beat each time with either indignation or alarm\". The recent influx of East Europeans has allowed the Mail and other papers to revive their traditions of stoking xenophobia. Bigotry against black or brown people is no longer acceptable and may even fall foul of the law. The trick is to find substitutes. The Daily Express prefers \"illegals\", the Mail concentrates on \"Poles\".</p> <p>The Mail's pieces, whatever the news that prompts them, portray an arcadian England sullied by rude foreign intruders, sponging off native taxpayers. \"Here in Peterborough,\" writes Sue Reid, \"a beautiful, quintessentially English city ... word of the government's largesse has spread quickly among ... the fastest-growing multi-ethnic community in provincial Britain.\" The headline is \"The town the Poles took over\". Fiona Barton enters the Polskie Delikatesy and, among the red cabbage and pickled cucumbers, can't make herself understood. \"I feel like a foreigner, but this is not Warsaw, Krakow or Gdansk. I am in Southampton.\"</p> <p>Some stories are clearly intended to create indignation: \"Polish migrants living in Britain claiming \u00a321m in benefits for children left behind\" and \"Fears for NHS and schools as 1,000 Polish children are born EVERY month\" are examples. Other stories are a touch more subtle. Any attempt by banks, supermarkets, pubs and publishers to cater for a growing Polish market is assiduously reported by the Mail, alongside stories about how police, firefighters and local authorities train a few staff to speak Polish or produce leaflets in the language. They are frequently preceded by the preposition \"now\", conveying the subtext \"whatever next?\" </p> <p>When Poles are involved in road accidents, that is usually, according to the Mail, because they can't understand English road signs. But when councils produce signs in Polish, that is a waste of taxpayers' money. One story contrasted Polish road signs here with a threat from the Polish government to \"deport Britons who fall ill\". In fact, only foreigners with such serious diseases as cholera and yellow fever would be refused treatment in Poland - because the country doesn't have the resources to cope.</p> <p>In the Mail, Poles are blamed for the most unlikely things. \"Beer prices set to rise as Polish lager sales soar 250%\", screamed one headline as though the two were connected. Poles can do nothing right. Like many migrants, they make substantial remittances to their families at home - which might be thought admirable because it ensures the money reaches people who need it. In the Mail, however, the headline is \"Polish immigrants take \u00a31m out of the UK economy\". If Poles return home, the Mail presents it as desertion of the UK. Though it is not usually vigilant in defence of gays, the Mail reported the Polish deputy education minister's plans to fire teachers who promoted \"homosexual culture\".</p> <p>Sometimes the paper's hatred of Poles fights with its belief that Britain is, in any case, going to the dogs, as when a teenage Pole returned home because, he said, schools in Poland are far superior. The Mail's implied verdict was that Poles had added insult to injury.</p> <p>Moszczynski thinks the Mail has mended its ways since his approach to the PCC and says \"there's not been much to complain about lately\". To my mind, he is too generous. Polish immigration is not as hot a story as it was, but the Mail still loses no opportunity to tickle readers' prejudices. Last month, for example, it reported that two bus company bosses were jailed after faking documents to cover up safety breaches. Some drivers worked for up to 31 consecutive days without a break and 16 unsafe buses were found at the company depot. All credit to the Mail for reporting this example of employers endangering their workers and customers. The aspect it highlighted, however, was the company's employment of Poles. They were in the first sentence of the story and in the headline on the Mail's website (albeit not in the paper). A prominent tinted box detailed bus companies' \"recruitment drive for Polish staff\", when the industry's frequent flouting of health and safety regulations was surely more relevant.</p> <p>The Mail is remarkably adept at detecting the talking points of middle England. That is the secret of its success. I don't deny - and neither does Moszczynski - that the Poles' arrival in large numbers genuinely caused resentment, some of it possibly justified, against government policies. But that does not excuse the Mail turning Poles into villains and dragging them gratuitously into every possible story. Like most journalists, I admire the paper's professional brilliance which, occasionally, is used to make points I agree with. That should not blind us to the truth: the Mail habitually uses what Tony Blair once called its \"absolute and unaccountable power\" to legitimise hatred and prejudice and debase public debate.</p> <p><strong>Guilty as headlined</strong></p> <p>So Barry George is innocent? Not if you read some papers. \"\u00a31m payout for Dando 'killer'\", was the Daily Express headline. As any headline writer knows, readers don't take in the quote marks. \"Barry George raped a girl on her doorstep\", recorded the Sun's headlines. \"He broke into Princess Di's home in a mask. He boasted he knew Jill Dando. So who did kill Jill?\" Obvious, innit? Inside, the paper headlined \"his 10 'links' to Dando\" (those quote marks again) that the jury didn't know about. A leader added that the Old Bailey verdict, acquitting George, \"means her killer is on our streets\". Which is probably true, though it's always possible the murderer has emigrated. But we know what the Sun really wants us to think.</p> <p>That is justice as dispensed by the red-top press. Evidence is for soppy liberals. It is enough to say he's just the sort wot would have dun it.</p>",
  "<p>No one defies like a decent fan in adversity. Luton, battered by the Football Association and Football League, had 7,000 of them in pouring rain for the start of an unprecedented campaign devised by the governing bodies - a deficit of 30 points for off-field administrative offences. Before kick-off five youngsters paraded a banner declaring \"LTFC will never die\". After a defeat that felt like more of the justice they have come to expect their manager, Mick Harford, said: \"We need time to gel. We'll be OK. There are 45 games left.\"</p> <p>Some people go to Suffolk beaches to draw a line under their troubles. Luton's was drawn for them, 30 feet under. The FA docked 10 points for misconduct involving payments to agents. The League weighed in with 20 for failing to agree a Company Voluntary Arrangement with creditors. Luton have been disastrously run for a while - by people the FA passed as fit for purpose. The new lot, LTFC 2020, were told by the League they would not be granted the \"golden share\" of membership unless they agreed not to appeal the 20 points. This is what beleaguered means. After the gun to their heads, shooting themselves in the foot was neither here nor there.</p> <p>It was certainly not surprising. Only eight shirts were filled when the programme went to press. Eight players came in on Friday on assorted arrangements. Gel was at a premium. \"The team was thrown together,\" said Harford. \"The plus side was in the chances and possession.\"</p> <p>The minus was in three clinically punished mistakes. Chris Martin lost the ball, Sol Davis his man, Dean Brill his marbles; the goalkeeper, sole starter from Luton's first match last August, cleared to Vale's Kyle Perry and was far from his goal when Marc Richards converted a cross that Ian Roper should have cut out. Harford called them \"silly goals, a trait at this club\". Luton's reply, a Sam Parkin header, came in the 35th minute, from their 11th corner. Such was their early dominance.</p> <p>It will take 10 wins for them to surface, which means October 21 at Grimsby at the earliest. Last season, in League One, they won 11 games in total. Only Vale won fewer. All is not lost, though. Last week the League hit Bournemouth and Rotherham with 17-point penalties for similar CVA failures - negative equity of a sort. Moreover, 46 clubs are said to be at the brink of administration. There could be all sorts of twists and falls in the League Two Handicap Chase. Football's authorities are always readier to make examples of small clubs while funking the issue with larger ones. And their new message is respect.</p> <p>Luton were once one of the large. In 1987 they came seventh in the old First Division. In 1988 they beat Arsenal in the League Cup final. In 2006 they pushed for promotion to the Premier League. Nick Owen, 50 years a fan and now chairman, paid tribute to those whose \"guts and vision have kept the club going and to the players who have made it clear they want to roll up their sleeves and prove a point - that we can surmount our astonishing penalties\". Many would say \"spiteful\".</p> <p>Kevin Nicholls, an old favourite, is back as captain and driving force. George Pilkington, five years at Vale, stood out in defence among six debutants. And Harford, a 1988 medallist, is Luton to the core, lately voted top Hatter by fans. There is hope where there is spirit fired by a sense of injustice. In the League Cup tomorrow against Plymouth the gelling can continue and the playing field will be level.</p> <p><strong>Man of the match</strong> Kevin Nicholls (Luton)</p> <h2>The League Two handicap placings</h2> <p>After one game Luton are 16 points from safety. Rotherham lead the race of the hamstrung after a 1-0 win over Lincoln City in their first ever game at the Don Valley Stadium in Sheffield, where Reuben Reid's low shot in the 44th minute secured the points. Bournemouth looked like matching them at Dean Court thanks to the 36-year-old captain Darren Anderton's effort from the edge of the area but Gillingham's substitute Gary Mulligan equalised with a 20-yard shot, his first touch, in the final minute of the game</p> <p><strong>Bottom five P W D L F A</strong> <strong>Pts</strong></p> <p><strong>Macclesfield</strong> 1 0 0 1 0 4 </p> <p><strong>Chester</strong> 1 0 0 1 0 6 </p> <p><strong>Rotherham</strong> 1 1 0 0 1 0 <strong>-14</strong></p> <p><strong>Bournemouth</strong> 1 0 1 0 1 1 <strong>-16</strong></p> <p><strong>Luton </strong> 1 0 0 1 1 3 <strong>-30</strong></p>",
  "<p><strong>Torn hamstring</strong></p> <p>Occurs during high-speed running and kicking and has one of the highest recurrence rates of all football-related injuries. Hamstring injuries can be related to back problems and are therefore more complicated to treat. Michael Owen suffered his first serious hamstring injury for Liverpool against Leeds on April 14, 1999, pulling up when chasing a through-ball. He did not play again until the next season, on August 28, against Arsenal. Rehab involves strength and flexibility exercises and massage for hamstrings along with manual treatment of the lower back.</p> <p><strong>Player out for</strong> <br>2-3 weeks up to several months.</p> <p><strong>Sprained ankle</strong></p> <p>The most common ligament to damage is on the outside of the ankle. Going over on the ankle stretches the ligaments and, at its most severe, can cause complete tearing and sometimes even break off the tip of the ankle bone. Arjen Robben sprained his ankle after a horrendous tackle by Quique Alvarez in Real Madrid's game against Recreativo on March 1, 2008 and returned on March 23. Rehab focuses on balance (ligaments are very important in stability), strength and flexibility.</p> <p><strong>Player out for</strong> <br>2-8 weeks.</p> <p><strong>Torn knee cartilage</strong></p> <p>The cartilage is the cushioning in the joint. It can be damaged by twisting and cause a tear or a fold, which often needs to be removed surgically. Robbie Keane, famously, ruptured his knee cartilage while stretching for the remote control in 1998 and, this time on the pitch, in December 2006. The second time he took one month and two days to regain his match fitness. Rehab involves surgery then rest before strengthening of thigh muscles as well as balance and flexibility.</p> <p><strong>Player out for</strong> <br>3-8 weeks.</p> <p><strong>Broken leg</strong></p> <p>Can be caused by an opponent's tackle but also, frighteningly, happens when a player is unchallenged, as David Busst, Henrik Larsson and Djibril Ciss\u00e9 (twice) have found out. Roberto Di Matteo suffered a triple fracture in September 2000 after an innocuous tackle and spent 18 months trying to get back to full fitness but never played again. If it is not a clean break, the injury may require surgery, then casting and subsequent physiotherapy.</p> <p><strong>Player out for</strong> <br>from 12 weeks. If the fracture is complex it can take up to a year. Some players, however, may never play again.</p> <p><strong>Anterior cruciate knee ligament</strong></p> <p>This ligament can be torn because of a rotation force in the knee. It is normally a non-contact injury and often occurs when a player is sharply changing direction or if he lands on one foot while the body is twisting over it. Paul Gascoigne tore the anterior cruciate ligaments in his right knee in the 1991 FA Cup final and took 16 months to recover before finally making his debut for Lazio. Rehab consists of surgery followed by physiotherapy.</p> <p><strong>Player out for</strong> <br>Six months in best case scenario but, if other ligaments and/or cartilage are affected, it could be up to 18 months.</p> <p><strong>Achilles tendon</strong></p> <p>Pain can occur due to degenerative changes in the tendon which can affect function but does not necessarily stop someone playing. The tendon can also rupture completely and can happen when a player sprints or lands from a jump and it is forcibly overstretched. Julien Faubert joined West Ham from Bordeaux for \u00a36.1m last summer but ruptured his Achilles in a pre-season friendly on July 17. He did not play a Premier League game until January 12 and made only eight first-team appearances all season. For a rupture: surgery, then physio. Otherwise strength exercises can be used to load the tendon to treat the degenerative changes.</p> <p><strong>Player out for</strong> <br>6-8 months with a rupture.</p> <p><strong>Broken metatarsal</strong></p> <p>Made famous by David Beckham in 2002 and has become increasingly common among footballers. The seriousness of the injury depends on which metatarsal is broken, with the fifth being the worst. Beckham broke his fifth metatarsal against Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a on April 10, 2002 after being tackled by Aldo Duscher and did not play again until the World Cup, on June 2. Gary Neville, on the other hand, broke his metatarsal in April 2006 and has played only one competitive first-team game since. Rehab involves casting and possibly surgery. Machines that can speed up bone healing are also used.</p> <p><strong>Player out for </strong><br>Six weeks is the best case scenario but if the bone doesn't heal, it could be a year.</p> <p><strong>Shin splints </strong></p> <p>A complex problem comprising of either pain from the muscles around the shin, traction of the sheath around the bone or even bone stress itself, or a combination of these. Kieron Dyer's problems started in 2002 and plagued him until the end of the 2002-03 season, although he often played through the pain. Treatment must address why the injury occurred to prevent recurrence.</p> <p><strong>Player out for </strong><br>Won't necessarily stop player playing but will affect performance and can last whole season.</p> <p><strong>Calf strain</strong></p> <p>Most commonly occurs when a player is sprinting. John Terry's return to Chelsea's first team in January 2007 after a back injury was delayed after he picked up a calf strain in training. It was not serious, however, and he returned to action two weeks later.</p> <p><strong>Player out for</strong> <br>2-12 weeks.</p> <p><strong>Groin strain</strong></p> <p>Rarely a simple strain of the muscle. Involves repeated strains because of poor control of movement around the hip region. Andrew Johnson limped out of Everton's defeat at Fulham on March 18, 2008 with a groin strain and did not play again for three weeks. Rehab involves correction of muscle strength around hip and possibly altering running and kicking technique. It is a complex problem and although players sometimes have a hernia repair (surgery) this does not always fix the problem. </p> <p><strong>Player out for</strong> <br>Difficult to say. Can plague a player for several seasons. </p> <p><strong>Broken ankle</strong></p> <p>Can happen when a player lands awkwardly or if the body twists over a fixed foot. Normally the ligaments are also affected, which makes the injury worse. Alan Shearer broke his ankle and injured his ankle ligaments in a pre-season friendly in 1997 and did not play until the following year, but made a complete recovery and led England's attack at the 1998 World Cup. Rehab consists of casting or surgery, depending on the fracture, and then physio.</p> <p><strong>Player out for</strong> <br>From 10 weeks for a simple fracture to up to a year.</p> <p><strong>Broken rib </strong></p> <p>Caused by a direct hit, either by landing on it or direct contact by an opponent. Extremely painful and the rib cannot be immobilised like other bones when fractured (as ribs are essential for breathing). Freddie Ljungberg suffered a broken rib when Newcastle's Steven Taylor trod on him on April 26, 2008 and faced an uphill battle to be fit for the opening Euro 2008 game on June 10. He did play, albeit aided by painkilling injections. Rehab is rest and painkillers (but not anti-inflammatories as this affects bone healing). </p> <p><strong>Player out for</strong> <br>From six weeks.</p> <h2>Need to know</h2> <p><strong>Muscles and ligament injuries can be graded according to severity</strong></p> <p><strong>Grade I</strong> Overstretching and micro-tearing of fibres - a simple sprain orstrain. Player will be back in a few weeks</p> <p><strong>Grade II</strong> Partial tear of fibres - more tissue damage so: more rest and a longer recovery time</p> <p><strong>Grade III</strong> Complete tear - a severe injury which can affect surrounding tissue and may require surgery</p> <p><strong>Management of acute injuries</strong></p> <p><strong>RICE</strong> Rest, Ice, Compression and Elevation</p> <p><strong>Fractures</strong></p> <p>A common misconception is that a fracture and a break are different injuries.

  "<p>It never takes long for the Championship to settle back into a familiar groove: pre-match gimmicks to generate atmosphere, the summer optimism washed away by a deluge of ill-advised passes and loose control and, to top things off, the evergreen Kevin Phillips springing from the bench to weigh in with a decisive late goal.</p> <p> The 35-year-old claimed that his scuffed shot in the 93rd minute was only his third touch after being introduced midway through the second half, which says a lot about a game that began frenetically but had long since begun to fizzle out. The United captain, Chris Morgan, otherwise stout throughout, allowed Phillips the half yard of space required as the ball dropped in the area. Phillips did the rest.</p> <p>It seemed the perfect way to placate any Birmingham fans harbouring doubts over the striker's switch from West Bromwich Albion, though the former England striker is too long in the tooth to let such matters weigh him down. </p> <p>\"I don't think I need to win anyone over,\" said Phillips. \"I'm 35 now - I don't think I need to show anyone what I can do. They can take it how they want to take it. I've said all along that when I joined Birmingham City I'll give 110% every game, every training session. That's all I can do.\"</p> <p>His move from The Hawthorns in the summer bucked the usual transfer trend, Phillips forgoing the chance of Premier League football to stay in the second tier. The two-year contract on offer at St Andrew's, opposed to the one-year deal at West Bromwich was key in his decision, but not the only consideration.</p> <p>\"At this stage of my career I felt I needed a little bit of security for my family but it wasn't just that,\" said Phillips, who was top scorer in Albion's promotion campaign. \"I feel that coming to Birmingham I'm going to be in a team that's pushing for promotion and, no disrespect to West Brom, I hope they do seriously well this season, but they're going to have to battle. Do I want to stay in the Premier League, coming off the bench or starting games, fighting hard to get results? I've been in teams like that before in the Premier League and it's not nice.\"</p> <p>Phillips ensured Birmingham's attempt to become this season's Albion got off to the ideal start, though it was a far from assured performance. The visitors had much the better of the first half, Billy Sharp and Gary Speed bringing saves out of Maik Taylor, and, though City improved markedly after the interval, they struggled to break down United's stubborn resistance. In fact, had Paddy Kenny tipped Phillips' injury-time shot past the post, it would have been his first save.</p> <p>It was \"exceptionally hard to take\" for the Blades manager, Kevin Blackwell, but the ominous aspect for the rest is that Birmingham are sure to improve. With a couple of additions in midfield and once the creative duo of Sebastian Larsson and James McFadden have adjusted to the often frenzied pace of this division, City wins are likely to become a familiar sight. \"Every time I see the manager at training, he's got his mobile to his ear,\" said Phillips, \"so I'm sure he's trying to do deals right, left and centre.\"</p> <p><strong>Man of the match</strong> Lee Carsley (Birmingham City)</p>",
  "<p>Small businesses are more vulnerable to exploitation and sharp practice on the part of energy suppliers than are residential customers, according to the British Chambers of Commerce.</p> <p>The BCC is urging Ofgem not to overlook business customers as the regulator carries out an investigation into the energy industry. </p> <p>Last month, a wave of steep price rises from energy suppliers sparked widespread concern about the numbers of residential customers likely to sink into fuel poverty this winter.

  "<p>Four years ago, when ballerina Nina Ananiashvili was invited by the newly independent Georgia to lead its national ballet company, she was already 41 - an age when most dancers are thinking about a career beyond the stage. However, she is still dancing, and for her company's opening performance of Giselle she was not only heading the cast, she was demonstrating why this is one of the defining roles of her career.</p> <p>A mature, powerful woman taking on a naive peasant girl is a stretch of interpretation, especially in a company of dancers so youthful that Giselle's mother Berthe looks more like her sister. But Ananiashvili is so responsively animated in her mime and dancing that she brings a total conviction to the role. Though her upper back may be a little stiffer with age, her jump less buoyant, her entire body appears charged with the excitement of falling in love. This sense of preternatural energy is key to her interpretation. In the scene when Giselle realises the horror of Albrecht's duplicity she does not retreat into trauma, she exhibits instead a maelstrom of whirling anguish, her long delicate arms thrusting blindly towards the watching villagers, her huge dark eyes glittering. In the second act, her energy drifts and dissolves into a more ethereal phase, yet her arms and hands, even at moments of stillness, never stop dancing. It is a memorable performance, but if Ananiashvili remains as astonishingly in control of her dancing as ever, the rest of the production does not provide her with an ideal frame.</p> <p>This Giselle was mounted for the Georgians last year by Alexei Fadeyechev, and it does not quite gel into drama. Viacheslav Okunev's designs have a Disneyish quality, while Fadeyechev leaches essential realism from the story by editing down the mime and stage action so that the first act blurs into wall-to-wall divertissements. Many in the Georgian company dance very well, yet overall there is a stolid, overly obedient quality to their style, which contrasts oddly with Ananiashvili's spontaneity. Vasil Akhmeteli, a glowingly handsome Albrecht, never looks as though he has internalised either the story or the music, while the chorus fails to generate the electric current of danger. </p> <p>But this is a young company with loads of potential. We can only imagine what it must have been like for them dancing on Saturday night as the crisis with Russia unfolded back home.</p>",
  "<p>EU foreign ministers meeting in emergency session today to discuss the situation in Georgia should begin by asking why it took the outbreak of war to focus their attention. They had no cause to be surprised. The warning signs had been apparent for at least a year, and the Georgian government had made strenuous efforts to raise the alarm. This time last summer a Russian jet violated Georgian airspace and dropped a missile north of Tbilisi in what appeared to be a botched attack on a Georgian radar installation. Russia denied involvement, but two separate independent investigations found otherwise. Despite this, Georgia's plea for diplomatic support fell almost entirely on deaf ears.</p> <p>Whether or not the incident was planned in order to test international reactions to an escalation of Russian military action in Georgia, Moscow clearly took encouragement from the absence of a response. With western governments preoccupied elsewhere - not least with Iran, where they need Russian support for a negotiated solution on the nuclear issue - Russian strategists evidently concluded that they enjoyed a free hand in their \"near abroad\". In April, Vladimir Putin announced that Russia would be strengthening official links with Georgia's two breakaway regions, Abkhazia and South Ossetia, including opening formal relations with their political bodies and strengthening trade ties. </p> <p>This only confirmed what had been apparent for several years - that Russia is actively supporting secessionist forces instead of respecting its mandate and behaving as an honest broker. But it ripped away the final pretence that its role in Georgia is one of peacekeeping. Other steps of escalation quickly followed. Russia moved 400 troops into Abkhazia under the pretext of working on a railway project. Russian planes started shooting down Georgian aerial drones. There was an increase in armed attacks by Russian-backed forces in South Ossetia, including a roadside bomb that injured six Georgian policemen and an attempt to assassinate the head of the pro-Tbilisi provisional administration of South Ossetia.</p> <p>None of these incidents received much coverage outside the region, so the impression has been created that Georgia initiated the current fighting with an unprovoked assault on South Ossetia. This is quite false. It has surely been a big misjudgment on Georgia's part, but resort to offensive operations came at the end of a long period of rising tension in which Russia had done everything it could to stir up trouble and provoke a reaction. </p> <p>The history behind Georgia's \"frozen conflicts\" is long and complex, and there is certainly fault to be found on all sides. The wars that followed Georgia's independence were brutal affairs in which members of all communities were to be found among the victims and perpetrators. It is therefore understandable that Abkhazians and South Ossetians are suspicious of Tbilisi and want guarantees about their security. It is also true that Georgia's president, Mikheil Saakashvili, has turned out to be something less than the model democrat he first seemed. Many former admirers have been shocked at his increasingly authoritarian leanings.</p> <p>But complexity is no excuse for abdicating moral judgment in situations of this importance. If responsibility for the conflict is not a black and white matter, the picture is not uniformly grey either. By any reasonable measure, the impact of Russian policy has been uniquely destructive in generating instability and political division in the Caucasus. The events of the early 1990s notwithstanding, Georgia's treatment of minorities that have remained under its rule has been generally good. Whatever his faults, Saakashvili is no Milosevic - and wild Russian allegations of genocide have no independent support. Under approp-riate international supervision, it would be perfectly possible to turn his offer of autonomy for Abkhazia and South Ossetia into a workable constitutional settlement that guaranteed the security and fundamental rights of people living those territories.</p> <p>The problem is that considerations of this nature form no part of Russia's vision for the region. It talks about defending the people of South Ossetia, but the Kremlin's aims are geopolitical rather than humanitarian. It seeks to restore the sphere of influence it regards as Russia's birthright, which it lost with the collapse of the Soviet Union (a \"major geopolitical disaster\", according to Putin). There is no place for an independent Georgia (or Ukraine or Moldova) in this mental picture. When Russian leaders talk about the benefits of \"sovereign democracy\", they are talking exclusively about their own sovereignty and not at all about democracy. The countries on their borders have no right to foreign policies of their own if they conflict with Russia's. This is especially true of energy supplies, where Georgia's role in maintaining the only east-west pipeline route free of Russia's monopolistic grip causes double offence. This is about the Kremlin's attitude to us, too.</p> <p>So how should western countries respond? The question arises most immediately in relation to Nato, where Georgia hopes to take a step closer to joining by securing a membership action plan. Sceptics within Nato, like Germany, will see the conflict as evidence that Georgia is an unreliable partner best kept at arm's length. This is entirely the wrong way of looking at it. Georgia's security concerns are real, and Russia is the cause. The onus should therefore be on Russia to reduce the security fears that drive the desire for Nato membership by withdrawing unwanted troops and becoming part of a political solution to the frozen conflicts. If it will not do this, it has to accept the consequences.</p> <p>Beyond this, everything depends on what happens next. There are troubling signs in some of the victory statements coming out of Moscow yesterday that Russia may feel emboldened to impose a punitive settlement, perhaps by annexing territory. This is not something that the EU and its allies should be prepared to tolerate. As so often with bullies, the Russian government's behaviour disguises deep insecurity and a craving for respect. This makes it more susceptible to our opinions than we often think. Further aggressive steps against Georgia would certainly be a reason to reconsider whether Russia should continue to enjoy the prestige that comes with membership of the G8. </p> <p>Another possible response ties in nicely with our current Olympic obsession. Russia is due to host the Winter Olympics in 2014 at Sochi and hopes to use the event, like the Chinese, as an expression of its power on the world stage. There would be very good grounds for asking the International Olympic Committee to consider whether a country that was actively working to dismember a neighbour only a few kilometres from Sochi was an adequate standard-bearer for the Olympic ideal. </p> <p>Too often European governments succumb to the fatalism of believing that Russia is beyond influence. That is perhaps the real reason why they chose to ignore the warning signs in Georgia until it was too late.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> David Clark is a former government adviser and is chairman of the Russia Foundation <a href=\"mailto:Dkclark@aol.com\">Dkclark@aol.com</a></p>",
  "<p>A-level and GCSE results are being artificially inflated by a marking process banned from use in Sats tests this year, experts have warned. </p> <p>The practice of \"borderlining\" or re-checking papers which fall just below a grade boundary was abolished for this year's Sats after warnings that results were being inflated by up to two percentage points. But exam boards told the Guardian that they are still using it in some GCSEs and A-levels where there are concerns about marking quality. </p> <p>The process is not banned in GCSE and A-levels, but a leading academic warned it is being unfairly applied and could have contributed to the 20-year trend of rising pass rates. The number of A grades awarded at A-level has increased from 17.8% in 2000 to 25.3% last year, and are expected to rise again when the results are announced on Thursday. </p> <p>Yesterday it emerged that some leading universities are choosing to ignore a new A* at A-level for fear that the new grade, brought in by the government to mark out the very brightest pupils, will be dominated by the private schools. </p> <p>Exeter and Bath say that if the top grade is used in offers, it is likely to \"disadvantage state schools\" and \"have a detrimental effect on widening participation efforts\", according to papers obtained by the Sunday Telegraph.</p> <p>This year's A-level results are expected to show the pass rate rising beyond 97% and a continued revival of traditional science subjects. The numbers doing languages is expected to have fallen after ministers scrapped the foreign language requirement for all pupils at GCSE. </p> <p>All three exam boards use borderlining where there is a concern about the quality of marking. Papers which fall just below key grade boundaries are remarked, but not those that sit just above the grade. </p> <p>Alan Smithers, the director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at the University of Buckingham, and an expert in qualifications, said while borderlining was crucial to maintain quality, exam boards should be checking either side of the grade boundary to be fair. </p> <p>\"The practice is important to check on errant markers but not if it can only have one result,\" he said. \"Every year if people are pushed above the threshold it can have a knock-on effect the next year. </p> <p>\"Since 1982 both the pass rate and percentage of A-levels awarded A grades has gone up year by year. You have to ask why this is happening. Almost certainly it is because pupils work harder, teachers have honed up on their skills, there's been structural change with curriculum 2000 and changes to the syllabuses - but there has to be a contribution to this gradual change from the change in what is considered acceptable for an A grade or pass.\" </p> <p>In 2004 a Qualification and Curriculum Authority report suggested that Sats papers which are three marks either side of a grade boundary be rechecked. But this year the QCA instead banned borderlining altogether as it awarded the contract for the Sats to the US firm ETS, which has failed to deliver the results to all schools a month after the deadline. The QCA argues that marking is now so rigorous the double-check of borderlining is not needed. </p> <p>At A-level and GCSE the code of practice for examiners allows for the process where there are concerns about marking quality. The biggest exam board the Assessment and Qualification Alliance, confirmed it used the practice for some exams. </p> <p>In a statement, Edexcel said it used it where there was a \"lingering doubt\" about the quality of examiners. The third, the OCR said it applied borderlining in 43 of its GCSE papers but in none of its A-levels. As with Edexcel, OCR insisted it was not used regularly and not for modular exams.</p> <p>Annette Brooke, the Liberal Democrat children's spokesperson, said: \"If you're going to look at the borderline marks you've got to look at either side of the border. If you look at either side then it's a useful process to check that pupils are getting the right marks but not if they can only move marks upwards.\"</p> <p>An Ofqual was reviewing such practices, said a spokesperson, adding: \"We require awarding bodies to have quality assurance procedures in place to ensure that candidates get the grade that their work deserves. There are a range of quality assurance procedures that awarding bodies can employ. The most important thing is that students get the correct results.\"</p>",
  "<p>On a normal Saturday night, the G Bar, Liverpool's most popular gay club, is so rowdy you have to shout yourself hoarse to be heard. But midway through last Saturday's revelry, the dancefloor fell silent after a message went out over the club's PA: a popular local teenager had died after being brutally beaten in what police believe to be a homophobic attack.</p> <p>Michael Causer, 18, had been in hospital for nine days on a life support machine before he died on August 2. As the teenager lay in a coma, his friends and family had kept vigil by his bedside, kissing and holding him, singing his favourite songs.</p> <p>This weekend, these same tunes, including We've Got Tonight by Ronan Keating and Lulu, were played at venues throughout Liverpool in Michael's memory. The gay teenager, a trainee hairdresser who changed the colour of his hair as often as his socks, had been a regular at the club. In the days leading up to the attack, he had told anyone who would listen how happy he was, having just got back together with his first serious boyfriend, George.</p> <p>What exactly happened the morning Michael was attacked is unclear, but it seems that he had been out with friends, then gone back to a house party in a cul-de-sac in Huyton, Merseyside. Police say the initial assault on Michael took place there, but his body was found outside by the busy Tarbock Road at around 11am on Friday July 25. He was lying less than a mile away from where the body of black teenager Anthony Walker was discovered in 2005.</p> <p>Michael's friends say that he had never been attacked before. \"If people had a go at him for being gay, he would just laugh,\" said Michael Donnelly, 18, a friend since primary school. \"He would just say, 'So what?' He was proud of being gay.\"</p> <p>Whether or not the attack on Michael was a hate crime, the case has heightened concerns about homophobia in Merseyside. \"There is an appalling level of endemic homophobia in Liverpool,\" said Steve Radford, a city councillor of 29 years standing, who is gay.</p> <p>Radford cites the Stormbreak report, which was commissioned by Liverpool council and made public last year, which found 59% of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people had experienced homophobic crime in Liverpool, compared with 47% in London.</p> <p>Ben Summerskill, chief executive of Stonewall, the gay equality charity, said: \"Given the level of homophobic crime that there is in this country, it is tragically not surprising that this is still happening.\"</p> <p>Research carried out earlier this year by YouGov on behalf of Stonewall revealed that one in five of the estimated 3.6 million gay and lesbian people in Britain had been a victim of hate crime, and three-quarters of those didn not report the incidents to the police.</p> <p>According to Deborah Gold, chief executive of Galop, London's LGBT community safety charity, other research \"shows that people avoid public affection, talk differently, dress differently, avoid certain areas, avoid public transport to minimise risk. Without this behaviour it is likely the rate of attacks would be far greater.\"</p> <p>In the past week the LBGT community in Liverpool has voiced a determination that things change. At a highly charged extraordinary meeting on Wednesday night in the Quakers' meeting house in Liverpool city centre, a group of around 40 people, including representatives from the police and city council, discussed the way forward. They agreed various initiatives, including a vigil for Michael, to be held in the coming weeks.</p> <p>Some saw homophobia as a particularly local issue. Gary Everett, artistic director of the gay theatre festival Homotopia, thought Liverpool's problem was its roots in Catholicism. \"The city is still shackled by religion,\" he said.</p> <p>A disproportionate number (55%) of children in Merseyside attend faith schools. Some of these, Everett said, were reluctant to improve their teaching on LGBT issues despite Section 28, the controversial law which stopped schools \"promoting\" homosexuality, having been repealed in 2000 in Scotland and 2003 in England.</p> <p>But many gay Liverpudlians do not think their city is any more homophobic than anywhere else. </p> <p>There was anger at the near-silence in the media in the first few days after Michael's death.</p> <p>\"When Rhys Jones was killed, there was uproar in all quarters. But when another young lad in the city has been viciously attacked, and dies as a result, the only uproar is coming from the LGBT community,\" said James Prendergast, a student. </p> <p>Two men have been charged with grievous bodily harm in connection with the assault and are due to appear before Liverpool crown court on Tuesday. A third has been charged with witness intimidation.</p>",
  "<p>The Conservatives today step up their campaign against lax bail policy by pledging to make the release of violent and persistent offenders more difficult - and make public safety a factor in all bail decisions.</p> <p>Amid concern about crimes committed by young men on bail, the shadow justice secretary, Nick Herbert, claimed that the average fine imposed on those who fail to answer their bail is \u00a360, the kind of sum levied for drunkenness or failing to pay the London congestion charge.</p> <p>\"The current system is not working - bail is too easily granted, frequently breached and improperly enforced,\" he said. \"Public confidence is undermined when bail conditions are routinely breached, offenders hold the criminal justice system in contempt and new victims of crime are created unnecessarily. It is time to tighten the bail laws and put public safety first.\"</p> <p>His policy document, Public Safety First, published today, demands a \"strong presumption\" against bail for those previously convicted of serious offences, people charged with murder, persistent offenders and suspects who have previously breached bail.</p> <p>Judges and magistrates would be allowed discretion in \"exceptional circumstances\"; government lawyers have warned ministers that any blanket bail ban would almost certainly fall foul of human rights law. Jack Straw, the justice secretary, is reviewing bail policy at Gordon Brown's instigation after a police inspector, Garry Weddell, killed his mother-in-law and himself while out on bail pending trial for killing his wife.</p> <p>The Tories would also seek to enforce bail terms more effectively. A new offence of bail breach, punishable by imprisonment, would be created, reinforced by magistrates and judges having more information on defendants' bail records. Tagging of potential risks and third-party bonds to cover sureties would also be introduced. No cost estimates are given.</p> <p>Current law enshrines a \"general right\" to bail except in specific circumstances, but concern has been voiced that 60 of the 450-plus murder suspects charged in 2008 were bailed after being charged. Four-fifths of violent crime suspects get bail - 65,000 against 14,000 held in custody - according to figures complied by the Conservatives.</p> <p>Measures to tighten up bail conditions and improve coordination in the system have already been adopted in Scotland.</p> <p>The Tory policy statement was designed to coincide with a memorial service this weekend to mark the first anniversary of Garry Newlove's murder. The father-of-three was kicked to death by three drunken teenagers, whose ringleader had been released on bail that day pending sentencing for assault. </p> <p>Mr Straw was criticised at the weekend for a \"shocking lack of consultation\" over plans to open hundreds of bail units, to be run by private contractor Clear Springs, in residential areas.</p>",
  "<p>They fettered his mouth with chains,<br>And tied his hands to the rock of the dead.<br>They said: You're a murderer.<br>They took his food, his clothes and his banners,<br>And threw him into the well of the dead.<br>They said: You're a thief.<br>They threw him out of every port,<br>And took away his young beloved.<br>And then they said: You're a refugee.</p> <p>With poems from the 1960s such as this, Mahmoud Darwish, who has died in a Texas hospital aged 67 of complications following open-heart surgery, did as much as anyone to forge a Palestinian national consciousness, and especially after the six-day war of June 1967. His poems have been taught in schools throughout the Arab world and set to music; some of his lines have become part of the fabric of modern Arabic culture.</p> <p>Darwish was born in the village of Birwa, east of Acre. His parents were from middle-ranking peasant families. Both were preoccupied with work on their land and Mahmoud was effectively brought up by his grandfather. When he was six, Israeli armed forces assaulted the village and Mahmoud fled with his family to Lebanon, living first in Jezzin and then in Damour. </p> <p>When, the following year, the family returned to their occupied homeland, their village had been obliterated: two settlements had been erected on the land, and they settled in Deir al-Asad in Galilee. There were no books in Darwish's own home and his first exposure to poetry was through listening to an itinerant singer on the run from the Israeli army. He was encouraged to write poetry by an elder brother.</p> <p>Israeli Arabs lived under military rule from 1948 to 1986. They were curbed in their movements and in any political activity. As a child, Darwish grew up aware that as far as those in control were concerned he, his family and his fellow Palestinians were second-class citizens. Yet they were still expected to join in Israeli state celebrations. While at school, he wrote a poem for an anniversary of the foundation of the state. The poem was an outcry from an Arab boy to a Jewish boy. \"I don't remember the poem,\" he recalled many years later, \"but I remember the idea of it; you can play in the sun as you please, and have your toys, but I can't. You have a house, and I have none. You have celebrations, but I have none. Why can't we play together?\" He recalls being summoned to see the military governor, who threatened him: \"If you go on writing such poetry, I'll stop your father working in the quarry.\"</p> <p>But relations with individual Jewish Israelis varied. Some he liked, including at least one of his teachers, some he loathed. Relationships with Jewish girls were easier than with girls from the more conservative Arab families.</p> <p>At his school, contemporaries remember him being very good in Hebrew. Israeli Palestinian culture was cut off from mainstream Arab developments. Arab poets who did impress him were the Iraqis Abd al-Wahhab al-Bayati and Badr Shakir al-Sayyab. Exciting innovations such as the Beirut group that clustered round the magazine al-Shi'r and the prosodic and thematic innovations of the Syrian poets Adonis (Ali Ahmad Said Asbar) and Nizar Kabbani did not reach the beleaguered Palestinians directly. Instead, much of Darwish's early reading of the poetry of the world outside Palestine was through the medium of Hebrew. Through Hebrew translations he got to know the work of Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca and Pablo Neruda. He also became influenced by Hebrew literature from the Torah to the modern poet Yehuda Amichai.</p> <p>His first poetry symbolised the Palestinian resistance to Israeli rule. His first volumes, Leaves of the Olive Tree (1964), A Lover from Palestine (1966) and End of the Night (1967), were published in Israel. During this time Darwish was a member of the Israeli Communist party, Rakah, and edited the Arabic edition of the party's newspaper, Al-Ittihad. Israeli Palestinians were restricted in any expression of nationalist feeling. Darwish went to prison several times and was frequently under house arrest.</p> <p>His earliest poetry followed classical forms, but, from the mid-1960s, it became populist and direct. He used imagery that he could relate intimately to Palestinian villagers. He wrote of olive groves and orchards, the rocks and plants, basil and thyme. These early poems have a staccato effect, like verbal hand-grenades. In spite of an apparent simplicity, his short poems have several levels of meaning. There is a sense of anger, outrage and injustice, notably in the celebrated Identity Card, in the voice of an Arab man giving his identity number:</p> <p>Write down at the top of the first page:</p> <p>I do not hate people.<br>I steal from no one.<br>However<br>If I am hungry<br>I will eat the flesh of my usurper.<br>Beware beware of my hunger<br>And of my anger.</p> <p>But his poetry also contained irony and a universal humanity. For Darwish the issue of Palestine became a prism for an internationalist feeling. The land and history of Palestine was a summation of millennia, with influences from Canaanites, Hebrews, Greeks, Romans, Ottoman Turks and British. Throughout all this has survived a core identity of Palestine. He was able to see the Israeli soldier as a victim of circumstances like himself. He expresses the bureaucratic absurdities of an oppressive military occupation.</p> <p>Darwish left Israel in 1971, to the disappointment of many Palestinians, and studied at Moscow University. After a brief period in Cairo he went to Beirut and held a number of jobs with the Palestine Research Centre. He remained in Beirut during the first part of the civil war and left with Yasser Arafat and the PLO in 1982. He moved on to Tunis and Paris, and became editor-in-chief of the influential literary review Al-Karmel. Although he became a member of the PLO executive committee in 1987 and helped to draft the Palestinian Declaration of Statehood, he tried to keep away from factionalism. \"I am a poet with a particular perspective on reality,\" he said.</p> <p>His literary work was changing. He wrote short stories and developed a style of writing poems that was a mixture of observation, humanity and irony. He argued that poetry was easier to write than prose. But the poetry continued inspired by incidents or relationships. There is often an optimism against all the odds in his works of the 1980s:</p> <p>Streets encircle us<br>As we walk among the bombs.<br>Are you used to death?<br>I'm used to life and to endless desire.<br>Do you know the dead?<br>I know the ones in love.</p> <p>During his Paris years Darwish wrote Memory for Forgetfulness, a memoir of Beirut under the saturation Israeli bombing of 1982 which has been translated into English. A poem in prose, it is a medley of wit and rage, with reflections on violence and exile. </p> <p>His later work became more mystical and less particularly concerned with Palestine. Often it was preoccupied with human mortality. He was careless of his own health and suffered heart attacks in 1984 and in early 1998.</p> <p>Darwish resigned from the PLO executive committee over the 1993 Oslo Agreements between Israel and the PLO, which he saw as a \"risky accord\". He was able to return to Israel to see his aged mother in 1995. The Israeli authorities also gave him permission for an unlimited stay in the self-ruling parts of the Palestinian West Bank, and he spent his last years in Ramallah and Amman, the capital of Jordan. </p> <p>In 2000 the Israeli ministry of education proposed to introduce his works into the school curriculum, but met strong opposition from rightwing protesters. The then prime minister, Ehud Barak, said the country was not ready. </p> <p>Darwish's work has been translated into Hebrew and, in July 2007, Darwish returned to Israel on a visit and gave a reading of his poetry to 2,000 people in Haifa. He deplored the Hamas victory in Gaza the previous month. \"We have triumphed,' he observed with grim irony. \"Gaza has won its independence from the West Bank. One people now have two states, two prisons who don't greet each other. We are dressed in executioners' clothes.\"</p> <p>Over the years Darwish received many honours. He was given the Soviet Union's Lotus prize in 1969, and the Lenin peace prize in 1983. He was president of the Union of Palestinian Writers. Married and divorced twice, he had no children; his first wife was the Syrian writer Rana Kabbani, who elegantly translated some of his poetry into English.</p> <p><strong>Margaret Obank writes:</strong> Mahmoud was a completely secular person, rather philosophical, an avid reader, elegant in his dress, and supremely modest in his opinion of himself. He liked to be alone, but would always be ready to speak on the telephone. </p> <p>While I had been reading his poems since the early 1970s, I got to know him through my husband, the Iraqi author Samuel Shimon. Mahmoud supported Banipal, the literary magazine we founded in 1998, and took pride both in issues of the journal and the many dialogues we helpled to promote. </p> <p>It presents work by Arab authors and poets in English for the first time. When we rang Mahmoud three months ago about doing a special issue on him, his reaction was: \"Do you think I deserve that? If you think I do, then I like the idea.\" Now it will be a tribute to him. </p> <p>We were with Mahmoud when he was awarded the Prince Claus Fund of principal prize in Amsterdam in 2004, the theme being asylum and migration. His acceptance speech was both powerful and thoughtful: \"A person can only be born in one place. However, he may die several times elsewhere: in the exiles and prisons, and in a homeland transformed by the occupation and oppression into a nightmare. Poetry is perhaps what teaches us to nurture the charming illusion: how to be reborn out of ourselves over and over again, and use words to construct a better world, a fictitious world that enables us to sign a pact for a permanent and comprehensive peace ... with life.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Mahmoud Darwish, poet, born March 15 1941; died August 9 2008</p>",
  "<p>People often talk about how hard it is to write. The words don't come, they say. Their mind goes blank. It's frustrating. People talk less often about how hard it is to literally write something. To type without backspacing needlessly, deleting and rewriting, deleting and rewriting, addingt letterss to thea end of wordsa, <strong>highlighting text for no reason</strong>, reading what you've written aloud until the words make no sense and having to include random lemon words because . . . well, you just have to. That's frustrating.</p> <p>I suffer from Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). My afflictions are mild and, to an extent, controllable. They're inconvenient, not incapacitating. I count everything, I wash my hands 40 to 50 times a day, I sometimes have to turn certain ways. When writing I suffer the obsessive compulsions mentioned above - though, obviously, equally obsessive editing prevents my written work reading like the last paragraph. These difficulties haven't taken over my life. I'm one of the lucky ones.</p> <p>Among others, Jessica Alba, Paul Gascoigne and Cameron Diaz have all confessed to having some form of OCD. Diaz's case is particularly interesting: not dissimilarly to multimillionaire entrepreneur Howard Hughes, she opens doors with elbows to avoid touching supposedly germ-infested doorknobs. This may seem overly paranoid, but to Diaz and other contamination OCD sufferers, it is necessary.</p> <p>David Beckham, meanwhile, admits to an obsession with symmetry. In fact, his wife Victoria admitted it for him; in her own, inimitable words: \"He's got that obsessive- compulsive thing.\" She explained how their fridges are coordinated, saying, \"Everything is symmetrical. If there's three cans of Diet Coke, he'd throw one away rather than having three - because it has to be an even number.\"</p> <p>This suggests that Beckham has issues with counting as well as symmetry. Counting is a common affliction for OCD sufferers, and perhaps my own biggest problem. Sufferers count to ensure there is the \"right\" number of something. For Beckham it's cans of drink in a fridge; for others, it's pens lined up on a table, coins in a pocket or even bricks in a wall (although obviously this one isn't changeable - merely \"countable\").</p> <p>For (1) me, (2) it's (3) words (4). For some time now I've found myself unable to stop counting the number of words being said in a conversation, in my speech and in others'. Usually they have to be divisible by three. Sometimes five. Either way, it makes me add extra words when I'm talking, to make up the numbers. Sherbert. Fortunately, I talk too much to be able to count after a while.</p> <p>Unfortunately, counting other people's words while they're talking can make me appear extremely rude. Not because I'm counting them out loud - that really would be rude - but because I find it difficult to concentrate on what they are saying, which can be very noticeable. Double the effect if there is a brick wall in the background, as I find myself counting its patterns. As someone who loves conversation, I hate not being able to immerse myself in it.</p> <p>Conversing with me was difficult when I was a child, too, but for a very different reason: I never stopped talking. I don't think I had OCD then. I certainly never noticed it. A counsellor told me she believed it nearly always stemmed from a traumatic childhood experience. This is a popular theory, perhaps because it's the most exciting one. But no, I didn't fall into a bog when I was seven or anything like that. I just noticed it at university, and then that it was steadily worsening. On average, the condition affects women in their early 20s and men in late adolescence. </p> <p>As anyone who saw Hollyoaks' brief flirtation with an OCD storyline will know, it can affect students massively. Living in student housing doesn't help anyone with cleanliness issues, let alone contamination OCD. My own particular brand of the condition decided to target my university work; essays became even more of a chore than usual. </p> <p>As well as the aforementioned typing compulsions, I couldn't move on to another paragraph without knowing the one before it was word-perfect. In fact, comma-perfect: I would spend several hours debating in my head, and to anyone who would listen, whether part of a sentence required a hyphen or a semi-colon. </p> <p>I'm not detailing my condition to be labelled \"weird\" by anyone reading, or for personal attention. On the contrary, it's very difficult to admit to having it. Even if my typing compulsions have improved - or, more accurately, my OCD has moved more prominently into other areas such as cleanliness and counting - how do I tell future employers about the problems I've had with working efficiently? Will telling people about my condition hold me back? I want to be a journalist - but could this, written at the age of 21, be the last article I ever have printed?</p> <p>It is hard to shake these anxieties. I am probably lucky that mine revolve around only my career. For others, the prospect of one's relationship with others changing upon \"coming out\" with OCD can be terrifying. </p> <p>It is easy to feel as if you are the only person who suffers from such strange thoughts and urges. I also didn't know how debilitating it can be (some sufferers are confined to their bedrooms and wash their hands several hundred times every day). I am thankful that my condition is not more severe. In fact, I often feel guilty explaining it to people, knowing there are others with much worse experiences. But this is not the right way to look at an illness; after all, saying you feel down isn't disrespectful to people suffering from clinical depression. Sometimes you just have to consider your own problems.</p> <p>I am not looking for sympathy. I am simply trying to draw attention to some of the many different forms of OCD. When it comes to this disorder, there are obsessions and there are compulsions. The stereotypes - handwashing, checking and so on - are compulsions: thoughts, or more commonly actions, that a person sees as necessary to reduce anxiety. These can be based on (sometimes skewed) logic or superstition, and are often recognised by the sufferer to be irrational. Carrying them out, however, alleviates concern, even when they are completely unrelated to an anxiety - for example, turning around three times will not prevent the roof falling in, but the fact that it does not \"confirms\" the compulsion's efficacy. It is not unlike taking a placebo.</p> <p>Obsessions - recurrent thoughts, ideas or images - can take on very disturbing forms; forms the sufferer would consciously never think of entertaining, such as killing a relative. Regular superstitious rituals can arise from the desire to make up for such thoughts. </p> <p>Often these are based on apparent logic albeit exaggerated - for example, Diaz's attempt to avoid germs on doorknobs - but many are irrational. These include everyday superstitions: for example, seeing a solitary magpie may trigger an obsession over a loved one dying (\"One for sorrow, two for joy\", etc); saluting the magpie to prevent this is an immediate compulsion. I'm not alone in touching wood, but I don't see it as a superstition, it's an automatic compulsion.</p> <p>Obviously this doesn't mean everyone with a superstition has OCD; simply that it is more understandable than some may think. Sadly, this leads many to underestimate the potentially devastating power of the condition.</p> <p>I have only recently come out about my own OCD and my doctor, who was very understanding, put me on a waiting list for cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). But although this is thought to be the best way to tackle OCD, discussing experiences is a good way to start, and OCD Action runs support groups for sufferers. I have also been trying one element of CBT myself - exposure and response prevention - which entails exposing oneself to an anxiety-inducing discomfort and resisting the usual \"escape response\". For example, a sufferer with cleanliness issues could plant his hands in some mud, and attempt to resist the urge to clean them. As yet, I have not been overly successful because I still have the mindset that \"It's OK, because soon I will be washing myself clean\". I hope to have improved by the time I commence my CBT with a professional at hand.</p> <p>Luckily, my family and friends have been supportive of my OCD, although sadly many blame it on themselves, although it is simply not their fault. Still, it is heartening that they care; it is important for non-sufferers to be understanding, even if they don't understand. To anyone who takes offence at seeing the rim of a glass wiped after they've used it, it really is nothing personal; it may seem hard to believe, but it's not. And to anyone who actually licks the rim of the glass out of protest - well, that's just not very nice, is it?</p> <p>Perhaps the most important thing is for sufferers not to feel ashamed. One great obstacle to seeking therapy is thinking, \"But this is who I am.\" I know I've felt that. But it's not. It's Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. When you have the notion in your head of taking a knife to your nearest and dearest, that is OCD; but while you continue to reject that notion, that is you, and you're a lot healthier than you think. </p> <p>And you know what? As long as it's under control, a little bit of eccentricity is not such a bad thing (21).</p>",
  "<p>'Why on earth,\" says Anne Portehault, chaining her bicycle to a railing opposite the H\u00f4tel de Ville in Paris, \"would I want to put a cycle helmet over my hair? I would look ridiculous.\" Well, not ridiculous, I counter, but you would certainly look less chic and enviably coiffed than currently. The 39-year-old is angry enough that from the autumn, Parisian cyclists will be required to wear fluorescent jackets. \"They only cost a couple of euros but they make anyone who dresses well - such as me - look absurd. That yucky yellow - I've got nothing to match it in my wardrobe. What am I going to do?\"</p> <p>But what about the danger of your brains spilling out of your head after being knocked over by one of the French capital's aggressive drivers? Isn't ridiculousness a small price to pay? I remind Portehault that it was nearly on this spot, outside the BHV department store on the Rue de Rivoli, in 1980 that the life of one of France's great penseurs, Roland Barthes, was brought to an end when he was run over by a van. \"I pay a lot of attention to the traffic,\" replies Portehault. \"I'm very careful when I cycle. So, no, I don't think looking ridiculous is worth it.\" </p> <p>It's worth pointing out that it's not only Parisian women who worry about their hairdos being mangled by helmets. A young man chaining his bicycle to a lamppost, who declines to give me his name, says: \"I've spent ages gelling my hair. I'm not going to ruin all that work, thanks very much.\" I find Marco Simioni, 45, a Paris-based architect and artist who originally hails from Vicenza, poised to ride off on a hired cycle. \"I've only been cycling for four months and I try to be very careful, but it's true I run a risk not using a helmet. It's a risk I'm prepared to take.\"</p> <p>I've come to Paris to find out why there is such a difference between French and British cyclists when it comes to wearing helmets. A few years ago, when I worked in Paris for the Guardian, I always wore a helmet when I cycled through the Marais to my office near the Op\u00e9ra Garnier and looked in disdain at the flowing locks of my more hirsute fellow cyclists as they cheated death and looked glamorous. Now, thanks to mayor Bertrand Delano\u00eb's bicycle rental scheme, V\u00e9lib, which was introduced just over a year ago, there are more Parisian locks flying in the wind than ever.</p> <p>In France there is a slang phrase \"C'est relou\", which translates as \"It's boring.\" \"C'est relou de porter un casque,\" several cyclists told me. It's boring to wear a cycle helmet. But not just boring: ugly, unstylish, fundamentally un-French.</p> <p>\"There is a great cultural difference between the English and the French,\" says Anne Portehault. \"We are very, very independent and very rebellious. This is the home of liberty, after all.\" Portehault, who rides horses in the morning and works in an American law office in the afternoon, doesn't use the sturdy V\u00e9lib bikes that can be hired from ranks one finds every 300m in Paris. Instead, she favours a venerable yellow number dating from the 1960s, which used to belong to her sister. \"It works but it looks rubbish. So no one's going to steal it.\"</p> <p>I'm not sure that Gallic rebelliousness tells the whole story of why, if you cross the Channel, helmet-wearing cyclists become much rarer. Perhaps, and this is just a theory, the British are more risk-averse than continentals. Indeed, the difference is not just between Britons and continental Europeans, but between many anglophone countries and others. Cycle helmets are common in the UK, the US, New Zealand and Australia. But if you go to some of the cities where cycling has a prouder history than in Britain - cities such as Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Berlin or Shanghai - you will find very few cycle helmets. </p> <p>Of course, it's unfair to over-generalise. On a nearby side street, I find a Parisian cyclist wearing not only a helmet, but a fluorescent jacket and sensible gloves. Why, I ask 35-year-old Laurent Marin, do you not bend your knee to Paris's prevailing sartorial strictures for cyclists? \"A few years ago I was cycling at the Porte de la Villette when I saw a motorcyclist was run over by a car. It was horrible. I rang my wife and said: 'I'm going to be late because I'm going to buy a helmet.' Now I won't let my wife or my children go cycling without helmets.\" Courier Felix Nizard, 20, tells me that he wears a cycle helmet his friend gave him. It seems several sizes too big, I say. \"Yes, but it looks kind of cool with the advertising all over it,\" he retorts. \"I feel happier wearing it now with all the V\u00e9libbers around. They are making the city more dangerous.\"</p> <p>The number of cycle journeys has grown exponentially in Paris since the introduction of the V\u00e9lib scheme, and many of the inexperienced users do indeed \"cycle like idiots\", as Marin says. That said, there have only been three reported cases of V\u00e9libbers being killed. On France's bicycling blogs, this is a hot issue. One blogger, a man who styles himself Ludovic Bu, wrote recently: \"The figures are clear: three deaths in a year and 24m journeys on V\u00e9lib bicycles. That amounts to a 0.0000125% probability of killing yourself while using a V\u00e9lib bicycle.\" But he adds that in Paris last year, 53% of those who died or were injured on Paris streets were motorcyclists, 22% pedestrians, drivers of four-wheeled vehicles 18% and cyclists only 7%. \"Thus, one can well see that it is less dangerous to travel on a bicycle than on a motorbike, on foot or by car.\"</p> <p>I'm not at all sure these figures warrant the inference that cycling in Paris is safe, but that doesn't matter: such rhetoric contributes to a blithe attitude on the part of Parisian cyclists towards sustaining death or serious injury. It makes them less likely to even consider whether wearing a helmet would be worthwhile.</p> <p>Delan\u00f6e's aim, according to many Parisians I spoke to, is to make Paris more like Amsterdam, where cycling is such a venerable and popular mode of transport that cyclists ride without helmets with a confidence that actually has some foundation. One Dutch idea that both the British and French authorities might consider introducing is the law of \"strict liability\" whereby, in any collision between a cycle and a car, the motorist is deemed to be responsible. This makes motorists much more wary. And what about the woonerf, a street or group of streets where pedestrians and cyclists have legal priority over motorists, and where motorised traffic is restricted to a speed limit of \"walking pace\"? In Germany, they have similar zones called Verkehrsberuhigter Bereich, where motorised speed limits are restricted to 7km/h. If only Paris's Rue de Rivoli or, say, London's Embankment became woonerven or Verkehrsberuhigter Bereich tomorrow, then I might consider leaving my helmet at home. But they aren't, so I won't.</p> <p>Matt Seaton, the Guardian's former cycling columnist and author of On Your Bike!: The Complete Guide to Cycling, distinguishes sharply between cycling in continental northern Europe and elsewhere. \"In northern Europe, especially in countries such as Holland and Denmark, there is much more of a consensus that bicycles have priority. In Britain, it's much more of a war of all against all. France is somewhere in between. In Britain our road environment is much more of a free market and that may make cyclists ride more quickly and aggressively than they do in the rest of Europe.\" </p> <p>It is also worth pointing out that in Britain we tend not to ride the sit-up-and-beg bicycles common in Holland; we ride mountain bikes and racing cycles that, you might well think, facilitate aggressive cycling. I once saw a cyclist respond to being abused by pedestrians for jumping a zebra crossing by leaping off his bike waving a D-lock like a mace. There is a medieval flavour to London's cycle scene. In that road environment, British cyclists dress up like extras from Rollerball or Blade Runner, almost as if they are going to war and expecting serious injury. The cycle helmet is part of the uniform. </p> <p>But is wearing a helmet actually going to save one from injury? This is a vexed issue among cyclists. The fact that London's tousle-haired Tory mayor Boris Johnson now eschews a cycle helmet has focused the debate. \"It's a very bad example for the leader of a capital city to set,\" said Simon Turner, a 41-year-old cyclist who suffered permanent brain injuries as a result of falling from his bicycle in Richmond Park. \"He's saying, 'Don't worry, take the risk.'\" </p> <p>\"In my efforts to do the right thing,\" Johnson replied in a newspaper column, \"I have ended up giving offence to both opposing factions. As soon as I started to wear a helmet , I was denounced as a wimp. As soon as I was pictured not wearing a helmet, I was attacked for 'sending out the wrong signal'.\" Cyclists, he argued, should have the right to choose \"hatless, sun-blessed, windswept liberty\" or \" helmeted security\".</p> <p>What would happen if Boris's brains were spilled, say, at the cycle lights next to Islington Central Library on Holloway Road near the mayor's home? Would cyclists pull up to his twitching, prone form, solemnly remove their helmets and say, \"Told you so\"? The issue was recently aired in the London Evening Standard, where columnist Dr Mark Porter defended Johnson's decision to cycle helmetless on the grounds that in over 20 years in medicine he had never had to treat a cyclist with a life-threatening head injury. \"Indeed, the Bicycle Helmet Research Foundation estimates that the average cyclist would have to pedal the roads for more than 3,000 years to suffer a serious head injury, let alone one that would be mitigated by a cycle helmet,\" wrote Porter. \"Research suggests that the mere donning of protective gear such as helmets encourages cyclists to take more risks on the road, and therefore, paradoxically, increase their risk of serious injury.\" Porter added that he was happy for his children to cycle without helmets.</p> <p>This column provoked a letter from Dr Andrew Curran, consultant paediatric neurologist at Alder Hey hospital. \"The probability of having an accident resulting in a serious head injury which could be mitigated by a helmet is mercifully low: there are many kinds of high-impact crashes where a helmet, or any form of body protection, would not save you. But the issue is that if an unhelmeted child is involved in a non-fatal crash resulting in a serious head injury, there is a 50 to 70% chance it will result in a serious cognitive deficit . . . It seems sensible that, just as we immunise children against serious diseases they are very unlikely to catch, we ensure they take precautions against the possibility of head injuries, however rare. The blase attitude of Boris Johnson and cycle campaigners on this point surprises me.\"</p> <p>The rise in cycle helmet use in the past quarter of a century suggests that Johnson is swimming against the tide. From the mid-80s onwards, a steadily increasing proportion of cyclists has worn helmets. The Department for Transport found in 2006 that cycle helmet-wearing had risen from 28.2% on major roads in 2004 to 30.7% in 2006, while on minor roads the figures were 9.6% and 13.8%.</p> <p>The total number of deaths of cyclists in the UK has been falling almost steadily since 1934, when there were 1,536 cyclist deaths. In 2007, there were 136. No one, however, has yet demonstrated that the rise in helmet use has made any contribution to that decline. Indeed, there is a statistic that associates a rise in helmet use with an increased risk of cyclists suffering </p> <p>serious head injuries. When cycle helmets were made compulsory in Australia the number of people cycling fell by a third, and although the number of serious head injuries fell, too, it only fell by 11%. So, despite a large rise in Australia in helmet use, the risk of head injury among those who continued to cycle actually rose. Of course, one can't infer from this that cycle helmets cause serious head injuries, but the statistical association of a rise in both helmet use and in head injuries is embarrassing for those who advocate helmets.</p> <p>What is a bicycle helmet supposed to do? The short answer is that it is supposed to reduce the risk of both skull and, more importantly, brain injuries caused by the brain jolting around inside the skull as the result of collision. According to the DfT's paper Bicycle Helmets: A Review of Effectiveness, \"While simple fractures to the skull can heal, brain injuries, unlike those to other body regions, do not and can lead to long-term consequences. \"A bicycle helmet is supposed to perform three functions, namely: \"reduce the deceleration of the skull; spread the area over which the forces of impact apply; and prevent direct impact between the skull and impacting object.\"</p> <p>The DfT paper concludes: \"There is now a considerable amount of scientific evidence that bicycle helmets have been found to be effective at reducing head, brain and upper facial injury in bicyclists.\"</p> <p>How are they supposed to do that? According to the DfT: \"These three functions can be achieved by combining the properties of the soft, crushable material [usually polystyrene] that is incorporated into helmets, usually referred to as the liner . . . and the outer surface of the helmet, usually called the shell.\" Historically, helmets had hard shells but now the tendency is for there to be no shell at all or a very thin shell.</p> <p>The blogosphere, however, seethes with sceptics who argue that bicycle helmets do not work when they are struck by fast-moving vehicles or when a cycle helmet hits a kerb or road at speed. Some argue that they may produce a false sense of security and a cavalier attitude to risk. \"Their design-intended strength is equivalent to a impact speed of about 12.5mph,\" writes cycling blogger Patrick Herring. \"They were never intended for collisions with cars. They're not a cycle-equivalent of motorbike crash helmets (and you can't wear one of those because your brain would boil). They work by the outer shell keeping the polystyrene in place whilst it absorbs the deceleration by being crushed. Counter-intuitively, if the shell breaks in the initial contact the total energy absorbed is a lot less: a broken helmet is one that didn't work.\"</p> <p>This, he says, means that above about 12.5mph the helmet has little effect; certainly it won't make a 30mph crash feel as if it happened at 17.5mph. </p> <p>One psychological study, meanwhile, suggests that helmets make cyclists more, not less, vulnerable. Two years ago, Dr Ian Walker, a travel psychologist at the University of Bath, had his bicycle fitted with a special sensor and then went off riding, sometimes wearing a helmet, sometimes not, and sometimes wearing a wig intended to make him look like a woman. It is, incidentally, marvellous that a) there is such a thing as a travel psychologist and b) that they get to do such fun-sounding research.</p> <p>The sensor measured the proximity of passing traffic. When Walker rode bareheaded, cars gave him a wider berth than if he was wearing a helmet. They gave, on average, an extra 85mm. Dr Walker concluded that this was because his dearth of proper kit indicated a lack of cycling competence that might result in wobbling, unannounced 45-degree turns, unscheduled wheelies etc. Helmetless, he looked more vulnerable. When he wore a helmet, motorists passed closer. On two occasions they passed so close that they hit him. \"One of the main findings,\" says Dr Walker, \"was that a behaviour intended to reduce risk (putting on a bicycle helmet) might paradoxically increase one's overall level of risk because drivers react to its presence by changing their behaviour.\"</p> <p>But it's what Dr Walker did next that I find particularly suggestive. He cycled about wearing a black wig that made him look - at least to his satisfaction - like a woman from the rear. He found that motorists gave him a wider berth than normal, which he ascribed to a gender effect: motorists are more considerate of women rather than men cyclists. Of course, there is another possibility, namely that Dr Walker was so poor a female impersonator that motorists, possibly out of solidarity with real women, or conceivably because they thought he looked barmy, steered clear. I haven't seen the photos of the experiment, so I can't be sure.</p> <p>What I find interesting is that this research suggests that women cyclists with more hair than is fair (or men cyclists impersonating such women) are less likely to be run over than mugs like me who wear cycle helmets. Which brings us back to Anne Portehault. </p> <p>I forgot to tell her that there is a new, putatively stylish cycling helmet cover devised to \"encourage females to cycle\". The \"cycle head dress\" is essentially a hat that you can put over your helmet to make yourself look chic. Have a look at their range at <a href=\"http://hi1-designs.com\">hi1-designs.com</a>. </p> <p>Portehault probably wouldn't have liked the cycle head dress. After all, Parisiennes like her have no need of helmets or helmet covers, and they have research from Bath University to support their lifestyle choices. There she goes now, cycling down the Rue de Rivoli, one of Paris's more terrifying one-way boulevards, wind in her hair, as chic as can be as the photographer takes her picture. You'll have to excuse me for feeling more than a little jealous. If only I had more hair and was a woman, I think as she rides off towards the Palais de Louvre, I might feel safe without a helmet as I cycled. Or maybe I should get a wig.</p> <p><strong>Have your say: Should cyclists wear helmets?</strong> <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/news\">blogs.theguardian.com/news</a></p>",
  "<p>Sometimes you just have to admit that Michael Heseltine was right. I once asked him why his company, Haymarket, had never acquired Press Gazette to go with its media titles including Campaign, Marketing and PR Week. His answer? \"You'll never make money out of journalists.\"</p> <p>And yet so many publishers have tried to prove him wrong. Since 1990, six companies of varying size, shape and ambition have had a stab at owning what in theory should be the industry's pride and joy: a magazine by its journalists for its journalists. Each has either passed the magazine on with unseemly haste or, in the case of Piers Morgan and Matthew Freud, gone spectacularly out of business in a high-speed crash for which I had the privilege of a front seat.</p> <p>Wilmington Group, which bought the wreckage 18 months ago, has found the road similarly treacherous. This Thursday's issue of the title will be its last as a weekly. Having seriously considered closing the print product entirely, last week Wilmington bosses relented and opted to turn it into a monthly, published alongside a website by what may end up as no more than three editorial staff.</p> <p>So why is Press Gazette such a poisoned chalice? And what makes it such a tough title to publish? As I discovered through four years of editing it, some of it has simply been down to poor publishing. But no other business-to-business magazine has had such obstacles placed in its way by the very people it tries to serve. Its treatment at the hands of some powerful players, within regional and national newspapers, has been little short of shameful.</p> <p><strong>Out of control</strong></p> <p>In each case, the issue has been about control over a title that often prints uncomfortable truths. With the regionals this took the form of removing the lucrative jobs advertising that had once been Press Gazette's lifeblood. Even when we offered free recruitment advertising to their editors - who wanted to use Press Gazette - most were barred from taking it by their bosses. This was to protect HoldtheFrontPage, a website owned by a consortium of the big four publishers - Trinity Mirror, Johnston Press, Northcliffe and Newsquest - which publishes uncontroversial stories about regional journalism.</p> <p>For the nationals, the battleground has always been the British Press Awards - the event that has become the magazine's commercial lifeline. It has been plagued by petulant, childish behaviour, both on the night itself and during the weeks of aftermath as strutting editors summoned PG's editor for a lecture on why the judging system must have been rigged; one year I traipsed around the offices of 14 national newspaper editors.</p> <p>It was the press awards that finally did for Morgan and Freud, after they had made their surprising entry into the B2B publishing world in late 2005. Morgan was not long out of his chair at the Mirror and wanted to spend some of his seven-figure payoff putting something back into the industry, he said. We should buckle our seatbelts, this was going to be quite a ride. Oh yes, and he had a great idea for a front page heralding his arrival based on a scene from Citizen Kane...</p> <p>A number of subscribers cancelled. \"I wouldn't put money into the pocket of such a vile creature as Piers Morgan via the Mirror, and I ain't going to via PG,\" wrote one. But on the whole, things looked good, and the magazine celebrated its 40th anniversary with the thickest and most lucrative issue in the title's history, thanks largely to the efforts of the consultant, Roger Eastoe. Morgan sent a few initial enthusiastic emails congratulating us on surviving \"two of the biggest media wankers in Britain invading your airspace\" (his words) but then set his sights on what would become a career in TV. </p> <p>After half a dozen brief visits we never saw him again. Freud was more hands-on commercially. He once picked the phone up during a meeting with me to tell Eastoe: \"I want you to sack the entire sales staff right now.\" But, crucially, their charm offensive over the awards failed. The Mail and Telegraph groups boycotted the 2006 event despite all of the stipulations they had laid down being met. The Telegraph's chief executive, Murdoch MacLennan, felt he had been misled by a suggestion that the Express intended to take part - which he found to be untrue when he rang Richard Desmond to check. The Mail's animosity appeared to me to be simple, although none of its bosses would ever say so outright: they just didn't want Freud to own the magazine. </p> <p><strong>Money pit</strong></p> <p>With those two groups out, Freud realised he had no sane way of getting the title back into the black, and without his financial support, administration was inevitable. Staff and freelance contributors were left out of pocket. To its shame, Wilmington refused to pay the journalist creditors from the old business. Technically they had no obligation, but given what the magazine stands for, it was a decision that stank. </p> <p>Freud had spent about \u00a31m. Morgan lost about a quarter of that. Yet for all their mistakes, I maintain that Morgan and Freud could have been effective owners of Press Gazette. They were industry enthusiasts. They interfered not one jot with the editorial team (Piers did once say, \"Which part of 'lay off Rebekah' don't you understand?\", but I didn't take him seriously) and they were prepared to put their own money into funding its journalism. Had the industry allowed them to run the awards, their tenure would have been very different - and eventually they'd have realised that stripping out the ludicrously overpaid top layer of management and doing some more of the B2B publishing basics (like employing someone to sell subscriptions, for example) was a route into the black.</p> <p>Now journalists must do without their weekly print fix. For Wilmington, it's a big gamble that the industry will still allow it to run the awards. That's far from a certainty, given previous lobbying for the event to be run purely as a Journalists' Charity fundraiser. Wilmington will also hope that enough of PG's weekly subscribers opt to stay with it, rather than demanding refunds. Staffing levels for the 64-page monthly have not been agreed - but there will certainly be redundancies. The new cover price hasn't yet been agreed either. Indeed, such has been the recent uncertainty over the title's future that a design for the monthly, out on August 28, has not yet been finalised.</p> <p>At least the current editor, Dominic Ponsford, if he stays, will be spared the ritual Thursday phone calls from various slighted editors or columnists huffing and puffing that they aren't being treated with the acclaim they deserve. I recall an email from the Mirror's Richard Wallace that broke a world record for F-words in a single paragraph (although he did have a point). A weekly newspaper editor once threatened suicide if I insisted on running a perfectly true story about her title. But there may be other implications to Press Gazette's demise as a weekly. As one senior executive put it to me: \"There's a whiff of death about an industry that can't even sustain its own trade magazine.\" Other business magazine publishers whose flagship weekly trade titles are finding the going tough will watch carefully too.</p> <p>Perhaps most important will be the absence of a forum for discussion about the less glamorous aspects of life as a hack. Corporate consolidation has already bred a generation of editors who are frightened of putting their heads above the parapet to speak out, their paranoia fed by a very real fear of email trawls and phone monitoring to root out \"troublemakers\". In a business where freedom of expression and holding power to account should be paramount, this is a hopeless state of affairs. An industry that can't have an open, honest debate about itself is in very big trouble indeed.</p> <p>\u00b7 Ian Reeves edited Press Gazette for four years.

Edited by Steve Barrett, the title was rocked last month by a libel action from Hachette, after it falsely accused the magazine publisher of facing an uncertain future in the UK. It had to apologise in the high court, admit its story was untrue and pay damages and costs. <br><strong>Stephen Brook</strong></p>",
  "<p>The young woman in the bikini top and bottle tan was having a good time in the bright afternoon sun. Gyrating opposite the Muscle Beach Gym on the boardwalk at Venice beach, she chanted her mantra in an eastern European accent. \"The doctor is here! The doctor is here!\"</p> <p>Sitting behind her in a beach chair, an equally bronzed young man repeated the single word: \"Caliente!\"</p> <p>The saleswoman changed her mantra: \"Medical marijuana! Medical marijuana!\" she said, proffering cards to the tourists ambling by.</p> <p>\"Do you suffer from Aids, glaucoma, insomnia, cancer, migranes [sic], eating disorders, anxiety, depression, nausea, chronic pain or many other disorders?\" asks the card. \"Walk-ins welcome. No appointment necessary.\"</p> <p>The Medical Kush Beach Club is probably not what the voters of California envisaged when they passed proposition 215 - the Compassionate Use Act - in 1996. The act allows patients in the state to possess or cultivate marijuana and permits the cultivation of marijuana for a patient.</p> <p>Twelve years later, marijuana dispensaries such as the Medical Kush Beach Club have sprung up across the state, providing legal marijuana to anyone with an appropriate referral from a doctor, typically obtained for $100-$150 (\u00a352-\u00a378), a standard medical visit fee.</p> <p>Yet while California and a dozen other states have passed medical marijuana laws, the federal government has not. </p> <p>This week, Charles Lynch, the proprietor of Central Coast Compassionate Caregivers, a medical marijuana dispensary in Morro Bay, 200 miles north of Los Angeles, found himself at the sharp end of a legal argument that has pitted state authorities against federal drug enforcement agencies.</p> <p>Facing five charges of distributing illegal drugs, Lynch was found guilty in a Los Angeles courtroom of selling 100kg (220lb) of marijuana. He faces between five and 85 years in prison; his lawyers intend to appeal. </p> <p>During his trial, the prosecution contended that Lynch had sold $2m worth of marijuana to patients from his dispensary between its opening in 2006 and a raid by federal Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agents in March this year. He sold drugs to young people \"not yet old enough to legally drink\", prosecutors told the jury, and carried the proceeds in a backpack full of cash.</p> <p>Lynch's lawyers argued that he had been told by a federal agent that local jurisdiction would prevail and he would therefore not be prosecuted by federal authorities, a legal principle known as entrapment by estoppel. But prosecutors - and the jury - dismissed the contention.</p> <p><strong>Bone cancer</strong></p> <p>Owen Beck, who as a teenager was taken by his parents to receive treatment from Lynch for bone cancer, was prevented, with other patients, from testifying as soon as his medical condition was mentioned. The judge ruled that state laws concerning medical marijuana were irrelevant in a federal court.</p> <p>Character references from the city's mayor and officials of the local chamber of commerce, who attended a ceremony to mark the opening of the dispensary, also made little impression. </p> <p>\"We all felt Mr Lynch intended well,\" the jury forewoman, Kitty Meese, told reporters after the trial. \"But under the parameters we were given for the federal law, we didn't have a choice. </p> <p>\"It was a tough decision for all of us because the state law and the federal law are at odds,\" she said.</p> <p>In Culver City, two miles from the beach at Venice, the staff at the Organica Collective, a medical marijuana dispensary housed in a single-storey stucco building tucked off a main road, sympathised. On July 31, Organica was raided by the DEA. </p> <p>\"It was like a smash and grab,\" said Ed Jones, a friend of the owner, Jeff Joseph. \"They were armed to the hilt, like we were a terrorist cell. They stole all our money. I'd rather have been done in by gangs.\"</p> <p>Sarah Pullen, a spokeswoman for the DEA, said the agency was \"enforcing federal drug law, which still holds that marijuana is an illegal drug in any form\". </p> <p>Even the permissible age of a patient is a source of dispute between the two competing jurisdictions: under state law, anyone under 18 is a minor; under federal law, it is 21.</p> <p>Despite the raid and the confiscation of its stock, records and money, the dispensary was up and running again the next day and, within a week, a steady stream of customers was passing through its doors.</p> <p>\"I heard the unthinkable happened,\" customer Clifford Williams shouted across to Joseph, as the owner sat on a tatty sofa in the dispensary's car park.</p> <p>Williams, 18, has been a customer for two months, having been referred by a doctor for anxiety and migraines. \"My parents wanted to put me on lots of pharmaceutical drugs,\" he said.</p> <p><strong>'War on people'</strong></p> <p>The raid caught the attention of an LA council member, Bill Rosendahl. \"It's ridiculous to have this constant battle between federal and state laws,\" he said. \"America has gone over the top. The war on drugs is out of control - it's become a war on people.\"</p> <p>Rosendahl and his fellow LA city councillors voted last year to issue licences to existing dispensaries and place a moratorium on new ones. The move, he thinks, has helped temper the DEA's approach. But until there is a change in federal law, he says, the agency will continue to carry out raids.</p> <p>\"The real leadership needs to come from the federal government,\" he said. </p> <p>He pointed to a bill launched the day before the raid on Organica by Barney Frank, a senior Democratic congressman from Massachusetts. His bill would eliminate most federal penalties for marijuana use.</p> <p>Another backer of the bill, Democratic representative William Clay of Missouri, described the prosecution of marijuana offences as \"a phoney war on drugs that is filling up our prisons, especially with people of colour\".</p> <p>But John Walters, the director of the federal government's Office of National Drug Control Policy, countered that too many people were trivialising the effects of the drug.</p> <p>\"Baby boomers have this perception that marijuana is about fun and freedom,\" he said. \"It isn't; it's about dependency, disease, and dysfunction.

  "<p>In 1956 Jill Adams, who has died aged 77, was declared by Picturegoer magazine to be \"one of our best glamour girl bets\", and she was much photographed and written about, not so much for her film roles as her purported status as \"Britain's Marilyn Monroe\". In truth her ready smile proved particularly suited to comedy, where she appeared with some of the top British movie actors of the era.</p> <p>She was born in London and grew up in Hampshire and Wales. Her father, Arthur Siggins, was Australian, though he had travelled widely in Africa and was the author of gung-ho adventures such as Man-Killers I Have Known and Shooting with Rifle and Camera. He met her mother, the silent screen actress Molly Adair, while she was filming The Blue Lagoon in Tanganyika (now Tanzania). Educated at home by a governess until the age of nine, Adams later attended Sherfield school, in Hampshire. During the second world war the family moved to Bryn-y-Maen, near Colwyn Bay, in Wales. </p> <p>After working as a window dresser, by 1944 Adams was an assistant artist at Mr &amp; Mrs Jones, a department store, where she was required to attend fashion shows and sketch the clothes. One day a model failed to arrive, and Adams, found to be the perfect size, stepped in, thus beginning her modelling career, which included a flag-hoisting recruitment poster for the Wrens.</p> <p>Out of 200 models, she was chosen by Cubby Broccoli to be an extra in the The Black Knight (1954) starring Alan Ladd. While appearing in Anthony Asquith's The Young Lovers (1954), Pinewood Studios publicists got her to pose for Monroe-style photos. The results had British soldiers based in the Middle East voting her their favourite pin-up, ahead of Monroe and Jane Russell, and earned her a Rank Organisation contract. </p> <p>Yet in Doctor at Sea (1955) she was overshadowed by Brigitte Bardot. (Later in the series, in 1963, she provided another Monroe impression, as a movie star in Doctor in Distress.) The producer-director team of Frank Launder and Sidney Gilliat cast her as one of amnesiac Rex Harrison's wives in The Constant Husband (1954). A year later, in Ken Annakin's rugby league comedy Value for Money she supported Diana Dors - she may not have been as successful as Dors, but she did not share her traumatic private life.</p> <p>Launder and Gilliat provided her with her best screen role in The Green Man (1956), partnered with George Cole in trying to foil droll assassin Alastair Sim. The same year Terry-Thomas was irritated by her in the Boulting Brothers' Private's Progress. The twins then gave her a bigger role, having to choose between Ian Carmichael and Richard Attenborough, in Brothers in Law (1957). </p> <p>On television, she appeared in an episode of the London private eye series Mark Saber (1955). By 1958 she was Bob Monkhouse's wife in the BBC sitcom My Pal Bob. Unlike its contemporaries, it still exists, but as Monkhouse acknowledged, \"not even the tender mercies of rosy nostalgia can render [it] watchable\". She was a regular, as a nurse, on ITV's The Flying Doctor (1959-60), an Australian co-production.</p> <p>In 1960 she featured, with Leslie Phillips, in Carry on Constable. Three years later an early sexploitation film, The Yellow Teddy Bears, gave her guest-billing as a prostitute; she had earlier observed that British film makers were not so much \"afraid of sex\", but rather \"they don't know it exists\". Her last role was in Arthur Hiller's Promise Her Anything (1965), with Warren Beatty - set in Greenwich Village, made in Britain.</p> <p>Her first marriage, to a US Navy rating, ended in 1953; in 1957 she married Peter Haigh, a BBC announcer. In 1971, they moved to the Algarve and ran a bar; after this marriage ended in 1976, Adams continued in the restaurant business, sometimes cooking herself. Having earlier been a keen sculptor, in recent years she concentrated on painting, particularly birds and animals, with some success. </p> <p>She died at her home in Portugal, and is survived by three brothers, two daughters (the eldest from her first marriage), one granddaughter, and one great-granddaughter.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Jill Adams, actor and restaurateur, born July 22 1930; died May 13 2008</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Friday September 5 2008.

  "<p>The US men's volleyball team briefly set aside their shock at the murder of their coach's father-in-law to record an emotional victory in their opening match of the Olympic tournament yesterday afternoon.</p> <p>Taking to the court at the Capital Gymnasium less than 24 hours after being told that Todd Bachman, the father-in-law of the coach Hugh McCutcheon and a familiar face to many of the team, had been stabbed to death at one of Beijing's leading tourist attractions, the Americans defeated Venezuela three sets to two. </p> <p>Bachman and his wife Barbara, the parents of McCutcheon's wife, the former US Olympian Elisabeth Bachman, were attacked while visiting the Drum Tower in the city on Saturday afternoon. Bachman died at the scene, and his wife was in a critical condition yesterday after undergoing eight hours of surgery. Their attacker, a Chinese national named Tang Yongming, killed himself by leaping from the second floor of the tower after the attack.</p> <p>The killing has prompted a security clampdown at tourist attractions across the city, and in a sign of the seriousness with which the situation is viewed, China's foreign and health ministers have visited the family in hospital to offer support.</p> <p>The US players have been ordered not to go sightseeing in the wake of the attack, which has overshadowed the first weekend of the Games and deeply affected the volleyball squad. The Bachmans were regular spectators at international matches, and were particularly well known to the women's squad, who played their first game last night.</p> <p>Thomas Hoff, the men's team captain, said a team-talk delivered by McCutcheon via conference call on Saturday night had helped inspire their victory. \"We talked with Hugh on the phone yesterday . . . and to hear his voice and get the leadership from him was great,\" he said. \"He is the guy who has been leading our squad for the last four years building to this and it meant a tremendous amount to myself and the guys when we heard from him. </p> <p>\"A lot of the guys had met him [Todd Bachman], and Wiz [Elisabeth] is part of the volleyball family, and we have all known her for a long time. We really felt the loss as being one of our own, and that's why it hurt so much. We were so close to them.\"</p> <p>The assistant coach, Ron Larsen, said the team would attempt to honour the family on the court. \"The Bachman family were great volleyball fans, Wiz was a wonderful player, and they watched her play almost every match - they were great followers and supporters of the men's and women's team,\" he said. \"The best way we can honour them is to compete every day and play hard every day, and enjoy and love the game of volleyball as they did.</p> <p>\"We went into this match knowing this tragedy had happened, but we also know we had invested four years, and in some cases eight, 12, 16 years of our lives in this opportunity to see what we could do. That might not mean winning a gold medal, but it's about playing better each day.\"</p> <p>China's president Hu Jintao expressed regret during a meeting with his US counterpart, George W Bush. \"I would like to express my heartfelt sympathy to you and the family of the victims over this unfortunate incident,\" he said. </p> <p>Earlier Wang Wei, vice-president of the Beijing organising committee, passed on his condolences to the family, and said that security checks would be stepped up across the city, including weapon searches at major tourist attractions. As many as 500,000 tourists are likely to visit the capital during the Games, which run until August 24. \"After this stabbing happened it is our intention to strengthen security in scenic spots, and we may add checks to ensure that no weapons are being brought into these areas. Beijing is a safe city but we are not immune.\"</p> <p>The Australian Olympic committee reacted by advising all its athletes and team officials to wear team apparel when venturing outside the Village. Wang Wei claimed that was an unnecessary measure, and that there was no need for others to take similar action. \"This was an isolated criminal act, and we have reason to believe that security measures are sufficient.\"</p>",
  "<p>Russian troops today took control of Tskhinvali, the ruined capital of the breakaway Georgian province of South Ossetia, after Georgian troops withdrew in the face of an overwhelming Russian counter-attack.</p> <p>The Georgian retreat came as Russia poured troops and tanks across its southern border into the rebel province and bombed Georgian targets. Tbilisi attempted last week to retake South Ossetia, which broke away from Georgia in the 1990s.</p> <p>\"As of today most of the city [Tskhinvali] is controlled by Russian peacekeeping forces,\" Colonel-General Anatoly Nogovitsyn, of the Russian general staff, told a briefing in Moscow.</p> <p>The Georgian president, Mikhail Saakashvili, ordered a ceasefire to begin at 5am this morning (1am BST), after seemingly underestimating the strength of the response from Moscow. Georgia's foreign ministry told the Russian ambassador it was now ready for immediate negotiations on a \"termination of hostilities\".</p> <p>However, fighting is still continuing tonight despite the Georgian offer of ceasefire. A Reuters reporter in the town of Gori, just south of South Ossetia, reported heavy bombardment of areas around Tskhinvali this evening, although it was not clear who was firing.</p> <p>Russian planes again bombed the Tbilisi military airport and a nearby aviation plant. One bomb exploded near the runway of the civilian international airport, although Moscow denied targeting that facility. </p> <p>Futhermore, there are reports from news agencies, quoting Russia's defence ministry, that the Russian navy has sunk a Georgian boat carrying missile launchers after a skirmish in the Black Sea.</p> <p>Earlier today in an interview with BBC World, Saakashvili rejected the notion that his call for a ceasefire signified a military defeat.</p> <p>\"Our troops are in good shape, there has been a very organised relocation and Russia has lost 20 aircraft,\" Saakashvili said, but he acknowledged that his country could not compete militarily with Russia.</p> <p>\"They [our forces] have been withdrawn completely because of the heavy casualties Georgia has suffered,\" the Georgian interior ministry spokesman Shota Utiashvili said.</p> <p>The head of Georgia's security council, Alexander Lomaia, said Georgian troops had moved to new positions outside South Ossetia. \"They are outside the region entirely,\" he said.</p> <p>In Tskhinvali, the South Ossetian government reported a lull in fighting and said morgues were receiving the dead.</p> <p>\"The humanitarian situation is horrifying. We have no cameras and cannot document what we can see but the morgues are busy receiving streams of dead bodies,\" the government spokesperson Irina Gagloyeva said.</p> <p>About 50 ambulances took wounded Georgian soldiers from a military hospital in Gori, a town just outside South Ossetia, to Tbilisi, the Georgian capital.</p> <p>The AFP news agency reported Lomaia saying that Russian troops were heading to Gori, but he denied having said this. Gori, about 40 miles northwest of Tbilisi, is just south of the border with South Ossetia. The largest Georgian town close to the region, Gori is an important strategic link between eastern and western Georgia.</p> <p>Lomaia said Georgia had met the demands of the US and France, the current holder of the EU presidency, who both called for a withdrawal of troops from the separatist region.</p> <p>\"We have fulfilled our side of the initiative. The Russians have not, but on the contrary have increased their military presence,\" he said.</p> <p>\"The Russians, despite the size of the forces that have entered Georgia, have failed to defeat our troops. But we have to be realistic, it is going to be very difficult to face up to them,\" he said.</p> <p>The French foreign minister, Bernard Kouchner, was to arrive in Tbilisi this evening with his Finnish counterpart, Alexander Stubb, who represents the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe.</p> <p>Kouchner is to submit a three-point plan based on an immediate cessation of hostilities, the full respect of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia and the reestablishment of the situation that existed before.</p> <p>The UN security council met today for the fourth day in a row to try to resolve the situation.</p> <p>The Nato secretary general, Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, said Russia had violated Georgia's territorial integrity in South Ossetia and had used excessive force.</p> <p>De Hoop Scheffer called for talks to restore Georgian control over its breakaway province and expressed concern about \"the disproportionate use of force\" - an apparent reference to Russian shelling and air attacks.</p> <p>Some observers feared Russia might not be satisfied until it saw the overthrow of Saakashvili, who has enraged Moscow with his pro-western stance and bid to bring his small nation into Nato.</p> <p>All over the region, there was worrying evidence that the conflict was widening. On the other side of the country, Georgia's other separatist region of Abkhazia sent forces into the Kodori gorge, the only part of Abkhazia controlled by Georgia.</p> <p>Saakashvili accused Russia of having 150 tanks and 10,000 troops in Abkhazia to support the separatists.</p> <p>\"No dialogue is possible with the current Georgian leadership,\" said the Abkhaz leader, Sergei Bagapsh. \"They are state criminals who must be tried for the crimes committed in South Ossetia, the genocide of the Ossetian people.</p> <p>\"We have received proposals for some sort of contact from the Georgian side. But we see yet again that they fail to grasp the meaning of what happened in the early 1990s [when Abkhazia and South Ossetia broke away] and they do not understand or do not want to understand what is going on now.\" Bagapsh claimed that women and children from villages inside Georgia were actually heading into Abkhazia to seek refuge.</p> <p>Out in the Black Sea, off the Abkhazian coast, the Russian fleet, including the cruiser Moskva, was gathering. A naval source told Echo Moskvi radio this was not a blockade, as that would be an act of war and Russia was not at war with Georgia. The ships were there in case refugees needed help, he said.</p> <p>The explanation given to Interfax by a Russian navy source seemed more likely. \"The crews are assigned the task to not allow arms and military hardware supplies to reach Georgia by sea,\" he said.</p> <p>Moscow appears to have calculated that the west, tied up in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and dependent on Russia for oil and gas, will do nothing to support Georgia beyond expressing impotent concern.</p> <p>Ukraine, an ally of Georgia, said it reserved the right to bar Russian's Black Sea warships dispatched to the Abkhazian coast from returning to their Ukrainian base of Sevastopol, Interfax reported.</p> <p>\"Ukraine reserves the right to bar warships and vessels which could take part in the action from returning to Ukrainian territory until the conflict is solved,\" it quoted the Ukrainian foreign ministry as saying. On Saturday, in a statement that hinted how the conflict could widen still further, Russia took a swipe at Ukraine, accusing it of \"arming the Georgians to the teeth\".</p>",
  "<p>The conflict in the Caucasus today spread to Georgia's second breakaway province of Abkhazia, where separatist rebels and the Russian air force launched an all-out attack on Georgian forces.</p> <p>Abkhazia's pro-Moscow separatist leader Sergei Bagapsh said his troops had launched a major \"military operation\" to force Georgian troops out of the mountainous Kodori gorge, which Georgian forces control as a strategic foothold in the breakaway Black Sea territory.</p> <p>He said \"around 1,000 special Abkhaz troops\" were involved. They were attacking and pounding Georgian positions using \"warplanes, multiple rocket launchers and artillery\", he said.</p> <p>\"The operation will enter the next phase as planned. And you will learn about that,\" he promised today, adding that he would create a \"humanitarian corridor\" allowing residents living in the district to flee.</p> <p>The offensive appeared to mark a dangerous new front in the conflict between Georgia and Russia - following Georgia's apparent withdrawal from its other breakaway region of South Ossetia today.</p> <p>Georgia immediately accused Russia of planning and executing the attack on the Kodori valley - a small but strategic enclave just inside Abkhazia, and controlled by Georgian forces since 2006.</p> <p>Georgian interior ministry spokesman Shota Utiashvili said: \"They have started the operation to storm Kodori gorge.\" Asked who was behind the operation, he replied: \"The Russian army.\"</p> <p>Speaking in Tbilisi, Georgia's parliamentary speaker, David Bakradze, said he had \"irrefutable proof\" that the Russian military was masterminding the \"plan\". He urged residents to stay calm, adding \"the enemy will be offered all resistance\".</p> <p>In an interview on BBC World, the Georgian president, Mikhail Saakashvili, accused Russia of having 150 tanks and 10,000 troops in Abkhazia.</p> <p>Georgia earlier said Russia had landed 4,000 troops in Abkhazia last night - a subtropical exclave on the eastern coast of the Black Sea, which abuts the Russian resort town of Sochi, where Vladimir Putin has his summer residence. </p> <p>It added that 10 Russian jets had pounded Tbilisi-controlled 'upper Abkhazia' on Saturday, and that Georgian government troops had shot one of them down.</p> <p>The Russian air force bombarded Chkhalata - the gorge's main administrative centre, where Georgia has installed an alternative pro-Tbilisi Abkhaz government. It also hit the airdrome village of Omarishara, Georgia said.</p> <p>Russia today insisted it did not want to \"escalate the conflict\". Army spokesman Anatoly Nogovitsyn told the agency Interfax: \"We do not intend to take the initiative in escalating the conflict in this region. We are primarily interested in stabilisation [in Abkhazia].\"</p> <p>But there seems little doubt that Russia is determined to evict Georgian troops from the Kodori gorge. Its aim appears to be to restore the de facto border between Georgia and Abkhazia - and to boost the pro-Russian separatist government based in the seaside town of Sukhumi.</p> <p>Abkhazia has enjoyed de facto independence since driving Georgian forces out in a 1992-3 civil war. Like South Ossetia, it has received help and assistance from Russia, with most residents now holding Russian passports.</p> <p>Vladimir Putin recognised Abkhazia as a legal entity in April - a move that enraged Tbilisi, which accused him of trying to annex the territory.</p> <p>The UN secretary general Ban Ki-Moon said he was profoundly concerned over growing tensions in Abkhazia.</p> <p>Ukraine also warned that it might not allow Russian ships deployed off Abkhazia to return to their base in the Crimea.</p>",
  "<p>It is astonishing how much contemporary political debate is rooted in historical precedent. Efforts to control the poor, as well as the movement and rewards of labour, are intertwined, and of considerable antiquity in Britain. Disapproval of \"demands\" for higher wages and prohibitions upon \"economic migrants\" long pre-date the industrial era. </p> <p>Who would have thought that current efforts by a Labour government to get people <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article4375087.ece\">off invalidity benefit</a> and into work were yet another re-working of the first law enacted in Britain to distinguish between those who chose to \"beg in idleness rather than earn their bread in labour\"? This was the <a href=\"http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/seth/statute-labourers.html\">Statute of Labourers of 1351</a>. Leaving aside the advisability of government taking inspiration from the medieval world, the statute followed severe reductions in population as a result of the black death. It was designed to curb wage-inflation induced by a shortage of labourers, who had deserted the fair fields of the land for the sweeter pastures of the afterlife. </p> <p>The statute required every able-bodied person under the age of 60 with no means of subsistence to work for whoever wanted their labour. No alms were to be given to able-bodied beggars. A \"vagrant serf\" could be compelled into the employment of anyone who claimed him. In this legislation, says historian <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Tuchman\">Barbara Tuchman</a>, lay the germ of later laws against trade unions and combinations of workers, who might \"conspire\" to make collective demands on employers. </p> <p>Although labour shortage induced by plague was different in origin from that created by the economic \"success\" of the 21st century, the problem it posed remains. While in the 14th century, it was necessary to set wages at a rate that prevailed before the plague, in this enlightened age no such draconian measure was required; migrants from Eastern Europe compliantly sustained the low-wage economy. </p> <p>The population of England fell by one-third in the 14th century, and recovered only in the 16th. With the re-emergence of \"surplus\" labour, and the removal of much charitable giving earlier provided by monasteries and religious foundations, punitive enactments against the poor and workless were again introduced. In the 1530s, the old and disabled poor were given a licence to beg. In the same decade, \"vagabonds\" were to be whipped until blood was drawn. For a third offence (a premature \"three-strikes and you're out\" policy), they could be hanged; a punishment soon withdrawn. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.ditext.com/morris/1563.html\">Statute of Artificers of 1563</a> reaffirmed many principles of the Statute of Labourers, especially the regulation of labour and limits on wages. Everyone between the ages of 12 and 60 was compelled to work. Those without a job were to be employed by a local farmer for a year. No one could leave her or his community without permission, and wages were set for all artificers, servants, labourers, workmen and apprentices. The Statute demonstrates the inseparability of the relationship between poverty and work, which has preoccupied the ruling classes of Britain for three-quarters of a millennium.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.victorianweb.org/history/poorlaw/elizpl.html\">Elizabethan Poor Law of 1601</a> made a distinction between the \"impotent\" poor, the idle and the able-bodied. It also firmly located responsibility for the care of \"every poor old, blind, lame and impotent person\" with the parents or grandparents of the sufferer, \"at their own charge\"; a concern which haunts present-day efforts to regulate the equivalent of the improvident poor \u2013 \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/aug/01/children\">parenting classes</a>\", contracts, covenants and all the other paraphernalia aimed at the neglectful and indifferent.</p> <p>Overseers of the poor were appointed by each parish to make sure the sick, aged and needy received assistance. Since these were local responsibilities, it was inevitable that some parishes would be more generous than others. Poor people drifted to where they might receive better treatment. <a href=\"http://www.institutions.org.uk/poor_law_unions/the_poor_law1.htm\">The Settlement Act of 1622</a> gave parishes the power to return paupers to their home parish, unless they had a \"settlement certificate\". Efforts to control the physical movement of the vagrant young today is replicated in antisocial behaviour orders, a desultory attempt to recreate a kind of \"settlement\" act, which would keep them at home after dark.</p> <p>Even clearer echoes of \"settlement\" resonate in discussions of the \"removal\" and \"deportation\" of <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/failed-asylumseekers-are-abused-by-private-security-companies-says-report-866879.html\">asylum seekers</a>. The belief that people are bringing hard luck stories to a Britain that is soft, \"an easy touch\", has its origin in the outraged innocents of generous parishes, whose open-heartedness acted as a magnet for the undeserving poor. Despite changes in technology, transformation of the system of production and wealth unparalleled in history, moral interpretations of the world persist: victims are still blamed by persecutors, and the powerful regard themselves as dupes of the cunning poor. </p> <p>The able-bodied were forcibly sent to the workhouse from the 1720s. This led to a severe reduction in out-relief, but by the end of the century, scandals over filth, sickness and promiscuity in workhouses (in some, a majority of children died before their first birthday), the policy changed: only orphans, the infirm and aged sought shelter in its inhospitable walls; the lazy and disreputable were directed to the house of correction.</p> <p>In 1792, the <a href=\"http://www.victorianweb.org/history/poorlaw/speen.html\">Speenhamland system</a> was introduced, whereby, as the cost of food rose, and the number of paupers increased, the earnings of labourers were topped up \u2013 a kind of primitive anticipation of a minimum wage \u2013 to keep pace with the cost of bread. This created a system of \"indiscriminate relief\", which, some felt, \"demoralised the people\". Nor is the panic over \"unwed mothers\" new. Ever since 1576, the children of unmarried mothers had been assisted by the parish. Towards the end of the 18th century, illegitimacy was so widespread that parishes complained that 40% of their budgets was spent on the offspring of the unwed. </p> <p>Nor should we imagine that our debt to a long and imaginatively punitive attitude towards the labouring poor ends there. A Royal Commission of 1832 resulted in the <a href=\"http://usp.nus.edu.sg/victorian/history/poorlaw/plaatext.html\">Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834</a>. Conditions in the workhouse were to be made \"less eligible\", which meant the most favoured individual in the workhouse must be worse off than the least prosperous outside. The shadow cast by castigation of the poor still haunts the political psyche of Britain; and continuous attrition of benefits to asylum seekers and the workless reincarnate the deterrent of the workhouse, without the expense of monumental buildings. In July, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/jul/21/drugspolicy.jamespurnell\">James Purnell announced</a>, in tones reminiscent of the <a href=\"http://www.usp.nus.edu.sg/victorian/history/poorlaw/plcommiss.html\">Poor Law Commission</a>, that \"Work works, and it is only fair we make sure a life on benefits is not an option\".</p> <p>This debate continues to deny the agency of economic, technological and social determinants in producing able-bodied poor, idlers and spongers, welfare cheats, the drug destroyed and the outcast; but sees the individual as responsible for his or her particular form of dereliction. That the cyclical expansion and contraction of the economy influence levels of poverty or worklessness is played down: whenever there is an economic \"downturn\", the first reaction is to turn vengefully upon its victims. As the Poor Law Commission reported in 1834:</p> <blockquote> <p>The dole given to such a person [who would not or could not find work] should be substantially less than the lowest wage offered on the market, and the worker's general condition should be so miserable and so stigmatized so as to motivate the search for employment irrespective of pay or conditions.</p> </blockquote> <p>Old dilemmas remain. Our responses draw upon extensive lore and myth, much of it lazy and vindictive, slumbering in the shallows of the social subconscious, to be drawn on as required. It seems this Labour government, too, is bent on pursuing sturdy beggars, vagrants and the idle poor: only the language has been \"modernised\". In the process, far from being \"progressive\", it is hurtling backwards to the asperities of Victorian and Elizabethan England, and perhaps, who knows, to the evolution of a techno-feudalism that will unite the 21st century with the medieval world.</p>",
  "<p>The head of Georgia's most important cultural institution - and wife of the deputy minister for foreign affairs - spoke out against Russia at the <a href=\"http://www.eif.co.uk/\">Edinburgh festival</a> today.</p> <p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nino_Ananiashvili\">Nina Ananiashvili</a>, artistic director of the <a href=\"http://www.ananiashvili.com/georgia/schedule/sbgschedule.htm\">State Ballet of Georgia</a>, which last night opened the Edinburgh international festival's <a href=\"http://www.eif.co.uk/explorer?genre=Dance&amp;start=2008-08-8&amp;end=2008-08-31&amp;display=detail&amp;sort=date&amp;results=4&amp;page=1\">dance programme</a>, condemned Russia's military aggression against Georgia, claiming it amounted to an \"occupation\".</p> <p>\"We just want to control our own small territory. We don't want to cut it into parts,\" said Ananiashvili, whose husband is Georgian government minister Grigol Vashadze, and whose close friendship with the president, Mikhail Saakashvili, led to her becoming a godparent, with Ukrainian president Viktor Yushchenko, of his child in 2006.</p> <p>We are independent. We want to be independent. We want to in our territory what we want to do,\" she said, speaking shortly before her company stepped on to the stage of Edinburgh's Playhouse Theatre to perform Giselle.</p> <p>\"It feels as though we are occupied. If it were any other country it would be called occupation. And we don't take one step outside our own territory.\"</p> <p>The military conflagration, she said, stemmed from Russia's \"power problem - they want to control us\". The responsibility for the crisis she laid at the door of the South Ossetians, who \"killed two militaries. That is how it started\".</p> <p>She said her company, 80 of whom are in Edinburgh, feared for the safety of their families, but that \"we are dancing for our country\". They plan to return home tomorrow.</p> <p>Ananiashvili, 45, was a star of the Bolshoi and the American Ballet Theatre, until Georgia's president, Mikhail Saakashvili, asked her to return home in 2004.</p> <p>She took control of the state ballet company and, with the help of generous government funding, revived its fortunes, adding classics such as Swan Lake and Giselle to its repertory, as well as works by the Georgian-born George Balanchine, and pieces from contemporary choreographers such as Alexei Ratmansky. Her own interpretation of the role of Giselle, which she dances in Edinburgh tonight, is regarded as among the greatest in living memory.</p>",
  "<p>A wave of a suicide bombings and police shootings left eight people<br>dead in western China yesterday, as Uighur Islamic separatists<br>attempted to steal global attention from the Beijing Olympics.</p> <p>In what appears to be one of the most widely coordinated assaults in<br>recent memory, the militants threw or carried home-made explosives<br>into a dozen government sites in Kuqa city, killing a security guard,<br>injuring two police officers, destroying two police cars and damaging<br>trading and commerce offices.</p> <p>Their most ambitious assault involved wheeling a tricycle laden with<br>explosives into a public security bureau just before dawn. One<br>attacker was shot, another blew himself up and two were captured,<br>according to the state-run Xinhua news agency.</p> <p>Six hours later, police tracked down some of the alleged militants in the<br>local marketplace. In the ensuing battle, two militants were reportedly shot and three blew themselves up with bombs made from bent pipes, gas canisters and liquid gas tanks.</p> <p>One suspect was detained, one was taken to hospital, and at least six were thought to have got away. The entire county of 400,000 people has<br>now been cordoned off, business suspended and roadside<br>operations shut. Paramilitaries with machine guns were patrolling the<br>streets.</p> <p>The clashes come less than a week after Xinjiang witnessed the deadliest attack on Chinese security personnel in a decade. Last Monday, two alleged Muslim jihadists in Kashgar drove a lorry at high speed into a rank of jogging paramilarites, then killed the survivors with bombs and knives, eventually claiming 16 lives.</p> <p>The authorities linked the earlier attack to threats made by three separatist groups who want to create an \"East Turkistan\" homeland for ethnic Muslim Uighurs in the region.</p> <p>On Thursday, a previously unknown group calling itself the Turkistan Islamic party released a video threatening to attack buses, trains and planes during Olympic fortnight.</p> <p>Kuqa is more than 3,000 kilometres from Beijing, but Olympic organisers have identified Uighur \"terrorists\" as the main threat to the games. They sought to reassure athletes, journalists and tourists that Sunday's attack would not disrupt the sports event.</p> <p>\"I do not believe this will have an impact on the Olympic games,\" said Wang Wei, the vice president of the games' organising committee. He blamed the assaults on \"East Turkistan terrorists\".</p> <p>Overseas Uighur groups claim the Chinese government is exaggerating the threat posed by separatist extremists as an excuse to impose its will on the Muslim population in Xinjiang.</p> <p>\"The goal of our organisation, and of the vast majority of Uighurs around the world, is to peacefully resolve the problems facing Uighurs in East Turkistan,\" said the US-based Uighur freedom movement leader Rebiya Kadeer. \"We advocate the principle of non-violence, and the promotion of freedom, democracy and human rights through peaceful means. We also sincerely hope for a peaceful Olympic games.\"</p> <p>She accused the Chinese government of a heavy-handed crackdown in Kashgar and throughout East Turkistan in the name of the Olympics, saying Uighurs had experienced higher rates of execution and detention, in addition to forced relocation, police monitoring, passport confiscation, and the destruction of places of worship. Many Uighurs are unhappy that an influx of Han Chinese over the past 50 years has made them a minority in their homeland.</p> <p>Tibetan exile groups also continued to use the games to draw attention<br>to what they say are human rights abuses in the Himalayan region.<br>Five activists, including a Tibetan woman from Germany, Padma-Dolma<br>Fielitz, were dragged off Tiananmen Square after displaying a Tibetan<br>flag and a banner reading saying: \"Tibetans are dying for freedom.\"</p> <p>The continuing unease in many Tibetan communities was highlighted by<br>reports from the Free Tibet Campaign that two women were shot and<br>wounded in Aba county town - the scene of some of the worst violence in<br>March's wave of unrest. According to the group, the shots came from a<br>building being used as a barracks for military reinforcements<br>sent into the area at the start of the month, apparently to ensure<br>there are no protests during the Olympics.</p> <p>George Bush used his visit to Beijing for the opening ceremony to raise the issue of religious freedom and improved human rights. Before meeting the Chinese president, Hu Jintao, and watching swimmer Michael Phelps win gold in the 400-metre individual medley. The US president and his wife attended a church service in the Chinese capital to underline his message.</p> <p>\"Laura and I just had the great joy and privilege of worshipping here in Beijing, China,\" he said as parishioners exited to Onward Christian Soldiers. \"You know, it just goes to show that God is universal, and God is love, and no state, man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion.\"</p> <p>But the authorities remain concerned about extremist groups. More than 100,000 police and paramilitaries have been deployed in the host city - along with 300,000 surveillance cameras - in one of the biggest security operations ever mounted in China.</p> <p>They were unable, however, to prevent the apparently random murder on Saturday of the father-in-law of the US men's volleyball coach. Todd Bachman was stabbed to death and his wife Barbara and a Chinese guide were seriously wounded at Beijing's 13th-century Drum Tower. The killer, 47-year-old Tang Yongming, leapt to his death after the attack.</p> <p>His motive remains a mystery. Tang - who recently retired from a job at a factory in the eastern city of Hangzhou, in Zhejiang province - had arrived in Beijing on August 1. The 47-year-old, who divorced two years ago, had no criminal record.</p> <p>\"His neighbors said they hadn't seen any abnormal behaviour from him before left Hangzhou,\" said a spokesman for the Zhejiang public security bureau.</p> <p>Bush said he was saddened by the stabbing, but thanked his Chinese counterpart for responding with speed and sympathy to the attack. \"I appreciate that a lot,\" Bush told Hu.</p> <p>Violent attacks on foreigners are extremely rare in China. The US<br>ambassador, Clark Randt, visited the survivors in Xiehe hospital, after<br>which the embassy issued a statement saying the attack \"appears to be<br>a senseless act of violence\".</p> <p>\u00b7 This article was amended on Monday August 11 2008. </p>",
  "<p><br>You can look but you can't hide ... Photograph: Getty</p> <p>The other day Lyn Gardner was wondering about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/aug/04/edinburghfestival.festivals1?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=fromtheguardian\">who is watching whom</a> on the Edinburgh Fringe. It's a question I've been aware of since last week when, having sat on the front row of the Assembly Hall, I was one of the people picked out as a comedic target by compere <a href=\"http://www.jasonbyrne.net/\">Jason Byrne</a>. Very funny he was too, but by the time he'd paraded me twice across the stage, identified me as \"The Journalist\" and drawn attention to my new stripy T-shirt, it meant an audience of 750 people were left in no doubt about who I was and what my purpose was. </p> <p>As soon as I left the theatre, the leafleteers were calling me The Journalist and trying to sound sympathetic. Ever since, I've been getting texts, emails and empathetic comments from friends, colleagues and complete strangers. I don't mind - it's an occupational hazard and all part of the fun of a knockabout festival, even if it means the T-shirt is staying in the drawer until September.</p> <p>But it did get me thinking about the visibility of reviewers. When you're doing the job, it never occurs to you that you're being watched, however egotistical you are. That's because, as the critic, you want to sink into the background, to get an experience as close to a regular audience member as possible. As soon as you become the target of attention yourself, the whole balance of the event gets out of kilter. It's one of the reasons I'd never take notes if I was sitting on the front row of a studio theatre (in fact, taking notes in any context starts to skew your relationship with the performance, but that's for another blog).</p> <p>So this year with <a href=\"http://www.supperfor4.org/\">Supper</a> at the Assembly Rooms, I had the chance to cross the fourth wall and become a kind of performer myself. The idea is that four people sit around a table eating fondue while an audience listens to one of two recorded monologues on headphones. What they hear on the recordings, they project onto one of the diners. On Wednesday, I volunteered as a fondue eater, then on Thursday, I sat and listened.</p> <p>What is strange is how unselfconscious an experience it was. Perhaps it's the angle of the table, perhaps it's the way the audience is sitting on comfy chairs, perhaps it's that they're all cocooned behind headphones, but it was very easy to put them out of mind while dipping your bread into the melted cheese. Our only instructions were not to laugh too raucously (the monologues are on the elegiac side) and to pause occasionally for moments of still contemplation. The conversation flowed and it was easy to forget we were under observation.</p> <p>Returning the next day as an audience member, it seemed to me the diners were similarly oblivious to our stares. I'd chosen the monologue by John Harvey performed by Sandy Grierson and had a clear line of sight to a fondue eater who was skilled at being part of the conversation without actually speaking much himself. It was as if his face were a mask, making it easy for me to project Harvey's words onto him. He gave no indication he knew I was staring.</p> <p>Even so, it's a haphazard technique and, in voyeuristic mood, I found it easier to imagine other ways this fascinating set-up could work. What if there was a story? What if the actors improvised an imagined conversation in real time? What if we could eavesdrop on the real conversation without the diners realising? What if the watchers were themselves being watched?</p> <p>And then, to paraphrase Dr Seuss, who would watch the watcher-watcher?</p>",
  "<p><strong>11.56pm</strong> And Michael Redd sinks a three-ball. US 101 China 70. And its game over. Actually, it was game over a while ago, but you know what I mean.</p> <p>Now, if you don't mind I will have to dash to the press conferences. It's been a gas. Thanks for your emails and abuse. Maybe we can do it again sometime. Goodbye from me at 11.56pm and 47 seconds - altogether now - (BEIJING TIME!)</p> <p><strong>11.54pm (Guess where?)</strong> For some reason the folks here don't seem to like Carlos Boozer. I don't know why. I spoke to him the other for five minutes and he seemed like a decent chap. Very smart, too. Anyway,they US are on 95 points with just over a minute to go. They might just get to a hundred..</p> <p><strong>11.45pm</strong>I could be wrong (I often am) but I think Dubya has left. The sinister blokes in dark jackets have all disappeared. Maybe they've all heard about the sausages on sticks and are off to the concession stand .</p> <p>The cheerleaders have arrived again and they are all wearing sparkly pink mini-dresses and pull-up stockings. Shockingly provocative. I don't know where to look...</p> <p><strong>11.40pm (In Beijing, of course)</strong> US coach Mike Krzyzewski (that would be Coach K, to those who know about college basketball) has started the fourth quarter with his B-team, which I think says all that needs to be said. Can I make one more prediction; LeBron and Kobe will come on for the last two minutes for some exhibition dunks; stupid dunks and so forth. By the way its 81-50 to the US. Before the start I thought they would win, which shows how much I know.</p> <p>SORE-HEADED ACROBAT ALERT! He's back and looking swell. Thank goodness for that.</p> <p><strong>11.35pm</strong> US 72 China 48. The crowd is quiet and I still haven't thought of an intro for my newspaper piece. Can anyone help? Meanwhile, the hooter has gone for the end of the third quarter and the artistic dance troupe are back out on court. I wonder what happened to that chap who landed on his head?</p> <p><strong>11.27pm (Beijing time)</strong> The US are up by 15 points and cruising. Unbelievably, the Chinese coach didn't take my advice and rest Yao, and a fat lot of good its done his team. The Americans are making uncontested buckets all over the place. By the way, I've just looked at one of the many, many bits of paper they hand out in the press box and LeBron and Kobe played identical minutes in the first half...The US coach isn't trying to cope with competing egos, is he??</p> <p><strong>11.20pm</strong> US 51 China 39..and thoughts turn to newspaper piece I have got to write as soon as I have finished this blog.. My mate Matt thinks I should start with the intro \"If Chairman Mao had been buried instead of embalmed he would have been rolling in his grave last night after China was defeated...\" Check the Times for that one in the morning Don't buy it, though. Look over someone's shoulder.</p> <p><strong>11.15pm (That would be Beijing time)</strong> I get the impression from emails that some of you know rather more about basketball than you should. Such as Daniel Lockersten, who writes to explain that FIBA rules disadvantage the USA because \"In the NBA, when a player is in the post, he can defend by placing his hand on the Offensive players back, and use is forearm to help shield him away. FIBA rules allow you only to use your forearm reducing the leverage a player can get. This is a disadvantage because Dwight Howard will probably foul out in the middle of the third quarter..\" Eh?</p> <p>Anyway, game on. The third quarter starts...</p> <p><strong>11.07pm</strong> Speaking of numpties who should not be allowed to be in charge of the TV remote, far less a global superpower, Gareth Davies emails \"I have to rather sheepishly admit that the BBC digital multichanel service IS showing the game. Finally i discover the reason for all the excitement about \"the red button\".\" Cheers Gareth for making me look even more ridiculous than I already am.</p> <p><strong>11pm (Beijing time)</strong> Half-time and its the USA 49 China 37. Here are some general thoughts. China have done about as well as expected, probably a bit better, largely because of Yao. But one man can't beat five on his own, especially when the other five include LeBron James. He's scored 11 points thus far and has struck about the same number of Chris Eubank poses. He's a cocky sod, but, geez, he is good; athletic, strong and determined. What a player. If I was the Chinese coach, I would rest Yao for most of the second half and save him for games the Chinese need to win to get through to the quarters. Now if you will excuse me for a couple of minutes while I must nip along and give Dubya a slap on the ear for all that nonsense in Iraq.</p> <p><strong>10.53pm</strong>USA 49 China 36. BBC election night impersonation alert! With one minute and three seconds of the second quarter remaining the Guardian Blog is about to call the result of this game. USA wins!! Oh well, it was nice while it lasted.</p> <p><strong>10.50pm</strong> It's now 35-29 to the US. More importantly, the tarzan cheerleaders are back out, only this time they're dressed in green bikinis. Yeuch. And they're dancing to classical music. Double yeuch. Yao looks knackered and no wonder. He's holding this together. I really, really fear for the Chinese if he goes off for an extended period of time. My mate Matt from the Times here has made a good point (for once in his life)..This USA team really is LeBron's team. Odd, given that Kobe is the man (as we used to to say back in the hood in Stirlingshire).</p> <p><strong>10.45pm</strong> Gareth Davies writes \"Why are the BBC showing repeats of a rainy cycling race instead of this clash of civilisations!\". Gareth, if knew that I would be pulling down 400 grand a year as the Director General of the BBC instead of trying to write a blog and watch a game of basketball at the same time..oh, its now 31-29 to the USA. Lots of exciting stuff, most of which I missed because I was reading emails.</p> <p><strong>10.41pm</strong> Second quarter starts with a three-pointer for China. USA come back with four straight points. No Yao on the court. I wonder if he's not quite fit. This is beginning to look a little bit ominous.</p> <p><strong>10.36pm (Beijing time)</strong> End of the first quarter and its the USA 20 China 16. Here are some general thoughts. I'll keep it simple for those with limited basketball knowledge, such as me. This really is quite exciting. There's an artistic dance troupe on the court right now. No offence, but where are the cheerleaders in the tarzan outfits??</p> <p><strong>10.33pm</strong> 16-16. China back in the game thanks to some nifty ball-handling and shooting by the point guard Chen Jianhau. Lots of complaining from the US bench about the referring...stop it, please.</p> <p><strong>10.27pm (Beijing time)</strong> Mmmm. Dunks by LeBron and Dwiight Howard and a three by Kobe and all of a sudden its 16-11 USA.</p> <p><strong>10.20pm</strong> China 11 USA 9. Time out called by the Chinese and here come the cheerleaders...anyway..back to the game...It's a messy affair thus far with lots of turn-overs and an absolutely shocking air ball by LeBron James. Yao is playing as if his life depended on it, blocking shots, setting screens, hitting his shots. He can't keep this up for 40 minutes...can he?</p> <p><strong>10.15pm (beijing time)</strong> Tip-off. US wins the ball. But loses it and...Yao shoots a three-pointer. I'll say that again for anyone who I'm joking: Yao shoots a three-pointer. The last time Yao shot a three-pointer Mao was the left-winger in Chinese communist party under-11 football team.</p> <p><strong>10.12pm</strong> Dubya's here. I can't see him but I can see lots of stern-faced men in black with their fingers to their ear and mysterious bulges under the jackets. I wonder what they do for a living?</p> <p><strong>10.05pm (Beijing time)</strong> Ten minutes to go and no sign of Dubya. Time to introduce the team. Yao gets the biggest cheer of the Chinese team but - get this - Kobe Bryant gets a louder cheer than Yao. Carlos Boozer gets booed.</p> <p><strong>9.57 (Yes, Beijing time)</strong> It might just be me, but it looks like the Americans are larking about in the warm-up. A bit cocky, if you ask me, although looking at the fresh-faced and distinctly smaller Chinese team they can probably afford to be cocky. Stand by for an avalanche of men-against-boys analogies.</p> <p><strong>9.52pm</strong> Oh oh. Here come the Yanks and the place has...gone mental. They love their basketball, the Chinese. Which gives me the chance to show off the results of my extensive pre-game research. Did you know that 300 million play the game in China, which is more than the population of the USA?</p> <p><strong>9.41pm (Beijing time)</strong> Yao Ming has just led the Chinese team out for the warm-up and the place has gone mental. Hair standing up on the back of the neck time. The crowd is cheering practice lay-ups like they're windmill dunks in the last seconds of the NBA finals. Maybe someone should tell them it won't be this easy when the game starts.</p> <p><strong>9.38pm (Beijing time)</strong> Croatia have beaten Australia. Hurrah! As in hurrah that's finished, now let's get on with the big game. But first some new from the press box, where a bloke from Germany is arguing with a bloke from Argentina over the last available seat. There is but 30-something minutes to tip-off and the question on everybody's lips is: what exactly is in those sausages on a stick? Actually, I'm lying; the question of the moment is \"Where will G Dubya and Ho Jintao sit?\"</p> <p><strong>9.20pm (Beijing time)</strong> Aggh. I forgot to say that the 9.18pm entry was at 9.18pm Beijing time. I guess I was distracted by the cheerleaders.</p> <p><strong>9.18pm Cheerleader Update!</strong> In a sensational development on the eve of the biggest sporting event in Chinese history a troupe of blonde-haired, Farah Fawcett-type cheerleaders have just wandered on to the court. Very fetching, too, in their Jane (as in the close friend of Tarzan) outfits.</p> <p><strong>9.11pm (Beijing time)</strong> The boss has just called from London to tell me to type in that all times are \"Beijing\" times. Rookie mistake. Anyway Croatia are still beating Australia, not that anyone within 50 miles of this building cares.</p> <p><strong>8.56pm</strong> I'm new to this live blogging lark so forgive me if I don't get the tone and style right. I was, ahem, being wittily self-deprecating when I said I didn't know the difference between FIBA and NBA rules.., but thanks anyway to Sternslovchild for that helpful and extremely tedious link. Anyway, back to the basketball arena, where Croatia are beating Australia 52-43 and a bloke from the half-time acrobatic team fell on his head and had to be helped off the court.</p> <p><strong>8.15pm (two hours before tip-off)</strong>Decided against sausage-on-a-stick for dinner and had a meal in a restaurant near the arena. Very nice too, even if we didn't know what we ordered and the waiters gathered round to laugh at us as we drank from our finger bowls. The rain was lashing down as we headed back but it didn't dampen the entrepreneurial spirit of the local touts. \"Pssst. Want tickets mate? Got two together three rows behind Ho Jintao and Dubya,'' one of them asked me. Or at least that's what I think he said.</p> <p><strong>Preamble</strong> \"Eagerly anticipated\" is one of those phrases journalists use when they can't think of anything original to write, or when they want an excuse to let the bosses know they arrived 12 hours before a sporting event just to make sure they get a seat in the press box.</p> <p>So let me begin by saying this: tonight's Olympic basketball match between China and the United States is the most eagerly anticipated sporting contest in Chinese history. I know this because - attention bosses - I arrived at the Olympic basketball stadium at 9.45am Beijing time this morning to get a seat and compile a list of eight things you should know before tonight's tip-off.</p> <p>1. The Chinese public appear to be crazy about basketball. The arena was packed when I got here just after breakfast. For Russia and Iran! 2. The food at the concession stands in the arena is - how can I say this politely? - limited: bags of crisps, Snickers bars and little sausages on sticks. Mmmmm. 3. Yao Ming, the star of the Chinese basketball team, arrived at noon and watched most of the Germany versus Angola match from the VIP section. He is very, very tall indeed, even when he is sitting down. 4. <a href=\"http://deadspin.com/5035136/the-george-w-bush-female-athlete-inspection-continues\">This chap</a> will be at tonight's game, assuming he drags himself away from the beach volleyball. 5. The United States team better not kid themselves they only have to turn up to win the gold medal. Greece played Spain in one of the afternoon matches and both looked capable of given LeBron and friends a decent game. 6. Tonight's game will be played under FIBA rules, which are markedly different from those applied in the NBA. This will be a disadvantage for the Americans, apparently, and hopefully someone reading this will send me an email explaining why. 7. Tonight's game will also feature Chinese cheerleaders, who are markedly different from NBA cheerleaders in that none of them have Farah Fawcett hair. 8. The US will win by a country mile because they have four great players and China has one.</p> <p>Now, if you'll excuse me I'm off to have a wholesome meal of Snickers and sausage on a stick before game time.

  "<p>How much is the west, and specifically the US, to blame for the war between Russian and Georgia?</p> <p>Quite a lot, according to some commentators, who happen to be American. Steve Clemons at Washington Note sees a <a href=\"http://www.thewashingtonnote.com/archives/2008/08/georgiarussia_c/\">\"high quotient of American culpability\"</a>.</p> <p>He argues that when Kosovo declared independence earlier this year, the price of Russian cooperation on other global issues rose considerably and that chances of a clash over Georgia's breakaway border provinces increased dramatically.</p> <blockquote> <p>By pushing Kosovo the way the US did and aggravating nationalist sensitivities, Russia could in reaction be rationally expected to further integrate and cultivate South Ossetia and Abkhazia under de facto Russian control and pull these provinces that border Russia away from the state of Georgia ...</p> <p>At the time, there was word from senior level sources that Russia had asked the US to stretch an independence process for Kosovo over a longer stretch of time - and tie to it some process of independence for the two autonomous Georgia provinces. In exchange, Russia would not veto the creation of a new state of Kosovo at the security council. The US rejected Russia's secret entreaties and instead rushed recognition of Kosovo and said damn the consequences.</p> </blockquote> <p>However, it could be argued that Russia and Georgia were heading for a clash over South Ossetia, with or without Kosovo independence, as the issue has been simmering for years. </p> <p>Vladimir Putin, the Russian president turned prime minister, in his public statements seemed to put more importance on Georgia's ambitions to join Nato. At its summit in Bucharest this year, <a href=\"http://www.nato.int/issues/nato-georgia/index.html\">Nato agreed that Georgia would become a member</a> of the western military alliance, which would not have gone down well with the Kremlin.</p> <p>What is not in dispute is that Georgia's president, Mikheil Saakashvili, overplayed his hand or walked into a Russian trap, but that is almost besides the point. James Sherr, an analyst at the Chatham House thinktank, argues that what the episode shows is Russia's determination to protect its owns interests whatever it takes. <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/2531270/Georgia-Russia-demands-to-be-regarded-as-number-one.html\">He writes in the Sunday Telegraph.</a></p> <blockquote> <p>... Russia has (in Putin's words) \"earned a right to be self-interested\" and that in its own \"zone\", it will defend these interests irrespective of what others think about them. For Russia, the broader implications are also becoming straightforward. To its political establishment, to the heads of Gazprom and Rosneft, to its armed forces and security services and to their advisors and \"ideologists\", the key point is that the era of western dominance is over.</p> </blockquote> <p>On Politico, Ben Smith looks at how Barack Obama and John McCain, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0808/12409.html\">the two US presidential hopefuls have reacted to the crisis</a>. He notes that Obama took a very mainstream position, calling for negotiations, but that McCain took a much more confrontational stance towards Russia. Smith concludes that McCain's position \"put him more closely in line with the moral clarity and American exceptionalism projected by President Bush's first term\". Of course now in the last days of his presidency, Bush has become much more pragmatic. The \"axis of evil\" rhetoric has been jettisoned and the US is talking to both North Korea and Iran.</p>",
  "<p>Police investigations, commissions of inquiry examining the errors committed during the Lebanon war of 2006, repugnance at former president <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshe_Katsav\">Moshe Katsav</a>'s alleged sex crimes, and now prime minister Ehud Olmert's announcement that, with charges of corruption swirling about him, he will resign in September: all of this suggests profound wounds in Israel's moral tissue. </p> <p>Old Israelis like myself are stupefied by the scope and scale of today's corruption and the multiplying investigations. Is corruption something that has always existed here but was somehow hidden until now? Are we learning of it because our prosecutor and police are bolder and better equipped nowadays? </p> <p>I do not believe that corruption is coming to light just because law enforcement is somehow better, or because citizens, like the presidential staff who accused President Katsav of sexual crimes and harassment, are more courageous. What is coming to light is a much deeper evil, a loss of values within Israeli society and its government, such as never existed before. </p> <p>This moral deterioration is most prominent in the behaviour of today's accused, who are much more impudent and aggressive than in the past. I remember how in the 1970's, when suspicion of corruption arose with respect to a Labour party minister, the minister took his own life. So did a director of a great bank, a brilliant economist, when he was suspected of financial crimes. </p> <p>When <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinchas_Sapir\">Pinchas Sapir</a>, prime minister Golda Meir's finance minister died, all that he owned was a modest apartment in Tel Aviv and some small savings. David Ben Gurion, Israel's founder and most prominent political personality, spent the last 11 years of his life living in a little wooden house in the desert kibbutz Sde Boker. Today, that house's extreme modesty still surprises visitors.<br> Former Prime Minister Menachem Begin also lived until his death in a simple apartment in Tel Aviv. Not the smallest shadow of the slightest suspicion of corruption ever disturbed his peace. </p> <p>True, corruption has also become more common in other countries in recent years, and many democracies are stained by links between politics and finance. Economic interests are supplanting ideology as the motor of politics, and money serves as the key instrument in elections. But how is it that Israel, which only a few years ago was hardly touched by fraud and corruption, is now swept by them? </p> <p>The recent episodes of corruption, I believe, are rooted in the division, beginning in 1967, of two altogether distinct sets of norms and values. On the one hand, the moral and jurisdictional principles of the democratic state have continued to be applied in Israel in accordance with the tradition of the rule of law. On the other hand, in the Palestinian territories, a new system of values has been progressively established. </p> <p>These two systems operate side by side, but the border that separates them has gradually become more porous, and the open breaches in it have become ever greater. Unlike colonial states, in which colonisers came from distant metropolises (and only in small numbers) the Palestinian territories are just across the border from Israel. </p> <p>In the West Bank the organs of jurisdiction operate in a completely different way. Palestinian lands are illegally confiscated. Jewish settlers act outside the law and commit provocative acts harming Palestinians, rarely incurring any penal sanctions. Injustice and exploitation are an everyday occurrence, justified by references to security or the ideology of Greater Israel. </p> <p>The boundaries between the two types of legalities could not remain impenetrable forever. Little by little, the state of occupation, which should have been temporary, became a stable reality, and the policy of creating Israeli settlements in the heart of the Palestinian population strengthened the connection between Israel and the occupied territories. The norms of a colonial and militarist regime have begun to infiltrate the governing organs of Israel's democracy, perverting their proper activities. Politicians, functionaries, army officials \u2013 usually coming from the right \u2013 introduced into Israeli political life the disgraceful norms in force in the occupied territories. So corruption has grown. </p> <p>Fortunately, Israel's judicial system remains independent and rests on foundations of proven integrity. The presence of many women in the magistrature and the police has also contributed significantly, in my view, to reinforcing the system. But when inadmissible norms become tolerated in silence, even the strongest juridical system becomes destabilised. </p> <p>Nor should we forget that the global economy, with which Israel is deeply integrated, creates infinite and complex opportunities for financial crimes. </p> <p>In these conditions, a strong judicial system and police force do not always suffice to contain corruption. The support of public opinion is also needed. </p> <p>I have the impression that the latest disturbing allegations of corruption among politicians and state functionaries have awakened Israel's citizens from their stupor. They are now demanding that the rule of law and justice return to their central place in public life. Of course, the true test will be whether such demands are reflected in September's parliamentary election. </p> <p><strong>Copyright: <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org\">Project Syndicate</a>, 2008.</strong></p>",
  "<p>The US men's volleyball team briefly set aside their shock at the tragic murder of their coach's father-in-law to record an emotional victory in their opening match of the Olympic tournament this afternoon.</p> <p>Taking to the court at the Capital Gymnasium less than 24 hours after being told that Todd Bachman, the father-in-law of the coach Hugh McCutcheon and a familiar face to many of the team, had been stabbed to death at one of Beijing's leading tourist attractions, the Americans defeated Venezuela by three sets to two.</p> <p>Mr Bachman and his wife Barbara, the parents of McCutcheon's wife, the former US women's Olympian Elisabeth Bachman, were attacked while visiting the Drum Tower in the city on Saturday afternoon. Mr Bachman died at the scene, and his wife was in a critical condition yesterday after undergoing eight hours of surgery. Their attacker, Chinese national Tang Yongming, killed himself by leaping from the second floor of the tower after the attack.</p> <p>The murder has prompted a security clampdown at tourist attractions across the city, and in a sign of the seriousness with which the situation is viewed the Chinese foreign and health ministers have visited the family in hospital to offer their support.</p> <p>The US players have been ordered not to go sightseeing in the wake of the attack, which has overshadowed the first weekend of the Games and deeply affected the volleyball squad. The Bachman's were regular spectators at international matches, and were particularly well known to the women's squad who played their first game yesterday evening.</p> <p>Thomas Hoff, the men's team captain, said a team-talk delivered by McCutcheon via conference call on Satruday night had helped inspire their victory.</p> <p>\"We talked with Hugh on the phone yesterday ... and to hear his voice and get the leadership from him was great,\" Hoff said. \"He is the guy who has been leading our squad for the last four years building to this and it meant a tremendous amount to myself and the guys when we heard from him.</p> <p>\"A lot of the guys had met him [Todd Bachman] and Wiss [Elisabeth] is part of the volleyball family, and we have all known her for a long time. We really felt the loss as being one of our own, and that's why it hurt so much. We were so close to them.\"</p> <p>The assistant coach Ron Larsen, said the team would attempt to honour the family on the court. \"The Bachman family were great volleyball fans, Wiss was a wonderful player, and they watched her play almost every match, they were great followers and supporters of the men's and women's team,\" he said. \"The best way we can honour them is to compete every day and play hard every day, and enjoy and love the game of volleyball as they did.</p> <p>\"We went into this match knowing this tragedy had happened, but we also know we had invested four years, and in some cases eight, 12, 16 years of our lives in this opportunity to see what we could do. That might not mean winning a gold medal, but it's about playing better each day.\"</p> <p>Earlier Wang Wei, the vice-president of the Beijing organising committee, passed on his condolences to the family, and said that security checks would be stepped up across the city including weapon searches at major tourist attractions.</p> <p>\"After this stabbing happened it is our intention to strengthen security in scenic spots, and we may add checks to ensure that no weapons are being brought into these areas. Beijing is a safe city but we are not immune. With regard to venues, we believe we have sufficient security.\"</p> <p>The Australian national Olympic committee reacted to the incident by advising all its athletes and team officials to wear team apparel that clearly identified them as Australian when venturing outside the athletes' village or games venues.</p> <p>Wang Wei said it was an unnecessary measure, and that there was no need for other athletes to take similar action. \"This was an isolated criminal act, Beijing has been a safe city for a long time, and we have reason to believe that security measures are sufficient.\"</p>",
  "<p> Michael Foot (centre) leads an anniversary march from Aldermaston to London.<br>In 1958, the first Aldermaston march to ban the bomb gave birth to the British protest song. Fifty years on, <em>Michael Foot</em> remembers the march and the crucial part music played in rallying support.</p> <p>'It was the novelty of nuclear weapons, plus the evidence of the lingering torture that radiation could inflict, which gave the main impetus to the creation of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. Nothing so evil had ever happened in our world before. Why had the truth about the crimes committed both at Hiroshima and Nagasaki not percolated to the outside world?</p> <p>In February 1958 we set up a committee that included Bertrand Russell, JB Priestley and Canon Collins of St Paul's Cathedral, among others.

  "<p>Georgia today said it had withdrawn its forces from the breakaway province of South Ossetia as it accused Russia of escalating the conflict by imposing a naval blockade and of preparing to attack Georgian troops in Abkhazia province.</p> <p>The Russian army said Georgian forces were still in South Ossetia. </p> <p>The announcement of a pullout followed three days of fighting in a Georgian push to take control of the pro-Moscow enclave from separatists. Russia reacted with a show of force by sending its troops into South Ossetia and launching air strikes inside Georgia.</p> <p>A Georgian military convoy carrying troops and towing heavy artillery withdrew from South Ossetia through the village of Ergneti, just inside the Georgian-controlled territory south of the separatist capital, Tskhinvali.</p> <p>\"They have been withdrawn, completely,\" a Georgian interior ministry spokesman, Shota Utiashvili, told Reuters. He said it was \"because of the heavy civilian casualties Georgia has suffered\".</p> <p>The Georgian president, Mikheil Saakashvili, visited Ergneti after Tbilisi said it had withdrawn its forces.</p> <p>But the Russian news agency, Interfax, quoted Vladimir Ivanov, an aide to the commander of Russian peacekeepers in South Ossetia as saying that Georgian forces, artillery and armour remained. \"Georgia has not withdrawn forces from South Ossetia,\" he said.</p> <p>Amid reports that Georgia was pulling out of South Ossetia, Russian warships arrived at Georgia's Black Sea coast, in an apparent attempt to set up a blockade and prevent Georgia from receiving weapons by sea.</p> <p>Interfax reported that the Moskva missile cruiser and other Russian Black Sea Fleet ships had been deployed to Georgia's coast to prevent any weapons supplies. A Russian navy spokesman refused to comment on the report.</p> <p>Early today, Russia bombed a military airfield outside the Georgian capital, Tbilisi. Georgia said the Russians were also massing troops in Abkhazia on the Black Sea, another rebel region that broke with Tbilisi in the early 1990s after a war.</p> <p>In New York, a top UN peacekeeping official said that there were indications the Abkhaz were preparing to launch a military offensive against Georgian special forces in the upper Kodori gorge in northern Abkhazia.</p> <p>\"At this point we are particularly concerned that the conflict appears to be spreading beyond South Ossetia into Abkhazia,\" the UN assistant secretary general for peacekeeping, Edmond Mulet, said.</p> <p>Georgia said Russia last night landed 4,000 troops by sea on the Black Sea coast of Abkhazia, the larger of Georgia's two breakaway regions.</p> <p>Utiashvili said that in the past few hours Russia had brought 6,000 troops into Georgia and a further 4,000 troops by sea. \"All of them are waiting for dawn to start active actions,\" he said.</p> <p>He said Russian planes had bombed Georgia's military airfield, eight miles from Tbilisi, at a plant producing Sukhoi Su-25 ground fighters. No one was hurt, but the impact could be heard in downtown Tbilisi.</p> <p>In a statement, the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, said he was \"profoundly concerned over mounting tensions in the Abkhaz zone\".</p> <p>A Georgian ceasefire offer yesterday was ignored by Moscow, which demanded a complete pullback to positions before fighting began. Shortly before the Georgian ceasefire announcement, shelling could still be heard. An EU-US delegation headed for Georgia to try to broker an end to the conflict.</p> <p>Russia brushed aside criticism of its military offensive. \"Russia's actions in South Ossetia are totally legitimate,\" the Russian prime minister, Vladimir Putin, said, visiting an adjacent region of Russia to which thousands of refugees have fled.</p> <p>Putin said Georgia's desire to join Nato was part of the problem. \"Georgia's aspiration to join Nato ... is driven by its attempt to drag other nations and peoples into its bloody adventures,\" he said, adding that Georgian action bore \"elements of some kind of genocide against the Ossetians.\"</p> <p>Russian officials said the death toll in fighting that began on Thursday stood at 2,000.

  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Preamble</strong> Good morning, everybody, and welcome to our coverage of the fourth day's play at the Oval. Yesterday wasn't a complete wash-out, with an hour and 20 minutes' play in the morning after a delayed start. Steve Harmison and James Anderson struggled to find their line, bowling so wide that the batsmen couldn't even be bothered to make a play, and it was the puppylike Stuart Broad who made the only breakthrough, destroying Neil McKenzie's middle stump and sending him packing by employing the novel tactic of bowling straight.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p>Hashim Amla and Jacques Kallis resume this morning with South Africa on 110-2, still 12 runs behind England. The forecast today is better, so we should get significantly more action, especially as it'll be an extended evening session, and fingers crossed for it running into the fifth day, because my dad and I have tickets for tomorrow. </p> <p>Do send me emails. I will look favourably on most subjects, particularly praise of Broad, who is my favourite. You can even email me to complain about yesterday's delayed start and keeping people hanging around for five hours, particularly if you're Sir Ian Botham, who rather entertainingly seems to take such incidents as a personal slight.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>Injury update</strong> Tim Ambrose has broken a finger. Marvellous. Peter Moores tells us he'll be on painkillers (not Moores, I mean Ambrose, though maybe Moores will be as well) and he thinks that in general he's kept well. So that's nice. </p> <p>I'm intrigued about the relationship between Moores and England's New Captain Kevin Pietersen. It seems, reading between the lines, that personality-wise they're not best buddies, but they have similar views on cricket, which is the most important thing. \"The coach is not there to be everybody's best mate,\" decrees David Lloyd. \"He obviously isn't,\" retorts David Gower, with a wry smile.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>Weather and pitch report</strong> Sir Ian Botham thinks it'll be an interesting morning in the intermittent Oval sunshine, with some movement on offer for the bowlers. He said that yesterday too, and indeed Harmison and Anderson did get movement. Just not the right kind.</p> <p>For those of you who don't already know, Nicole Cooke has won Team GB's first gold of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/aug/10/olympics.daytwo.minutebyminute\">the Olympics</a> in the women's road-race. Fittingly, Gary Naylor wishes to hail her in the first email of the morning: \"In a pretty dismal period for British sport, Nicole Cooke has shone like a beacon of sustained excellence.\" Indeed.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>27th over: South Africa 110-2 (Amla 71, Kallis 2)</strong> Kevin Pietersen and his hardy troops take to the field, and Broad gets to bowl one ball to complete the over he started yesterday morning, tempting Amla to flash and miss. \"Despite having the last Test match off, sorry to see that the poor little lamb was obviously still too tired to go and get a haircut,\" says Richard Norris. Harsh, Richard. He probably doesn't like sitting still for that long. And probably doesn't like the way his mum cuts his hair.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>28th over: South Africa 114-2 (Amla 71, Kallis 6)</strong> As David Lloyd wishes everyone good morning, Michael Holding points out to him that it's not morning everywhere in the world. \"Oh, I do get confused!\" wails poor old Bumble. Harmison resumes where he left off with some slightly wide deliveries, but then tests Kallis with a nasty one that rears up towards his hands, then one that bounces and forces evasion.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>29th over: South Africa 115-2 (Amla 72, Kallis 6)</strong> A short delay between overs as Tim Ambrose gets his sore fingers taped up again. David Lloyd chuckles about the good old days when wicketkeepers with broken fingers had lolly sticks stuck to their hands, to keep the misshaped digits straight. James Anderson replaces Broad, and concedes a single off the last ball to Amla, who plays towards deep point.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>Wicket! Amla 76 c Ambrose b Harmison (South Africa 119-3)</strong> Excellent catch from Ambrose, diving down to his right with that smashed-up finger, as Harmison serves up a line ball with his last delivery tempting a nick behind. I was about to comment on Harmison's action, which Messrs Holding and Pollock analysed yesterday, and they made the point that his arm at the point of bowling is now over the perpendicular, which throws the rest of his stance out and thus goes some way towards explaining his tendency towards the wide in recent times.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>31st over: South Africa 120-3 (Kallis 7, Prince 0)</strong> Tim Ambrose grins the whole way through this Anderson over. Watching the slow-motion replay of the catch, his left foot actually slips, making the dive even more admirable.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>32nd over: South Africa 120-3 (Kallis 7, Prince 0)</strong> \"Why won't KP use a third man? This is not a riddle,\" enquires John Starbuck. I think it's a little too early to make sweeping generalisations about Pietersen's captaincy or field settings, but certainly what he's been doing is often a sharp, attacking, refreshing contrast to what Michael Vaughan would have done in similar situations. Maiden for Harmison.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>33rd over: South Africa 121-3 (Kallis 7, Prince 1)</strong> \"Getting shape, Jimmy Anderson, just not directing it quite enough to the right-handers,\" says kindly Michael Holding. There's an lbw shout against Prince but it's never going to be given; it's pitching outside the line.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>34th over: South Africa 121-3 (Kallis 7, Prince 1)</strong> Some nifty work in the field from Alastair Cook prevents a mighty smash from Prince getting past the close-field cordon, and it's a maiden for Steve Harmison.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>35th over: South Africa 122-3 (Kallis 8, Prince 1)</strong> \"Interestingly Harmy got that wicket just as the National Anthem was being played for Nicole Cooke,\" notes Clare A Davies. \"Wonder if any of our other athletes can help out with the wicket-taking today by winning a few more medals.\" That would be nice, if unlikely. With that Kallis single off Anderson, the scores are now level, and South Africa are effectively on 0 for the loss of three wickets.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>36th over: South Africa 122-3 (Kallis 8, Prince 1)</strong> Pete Horn wants to know about the injury to England's wicketkeeper: \"When did it happen? And how?\" Well, there was certainly no mention made of it yesterday, so I'm making the assumption that he broke it in that spectacular attempted catch yesterday morning, when he was wrong-footed and crashed to the ground. If I find out anything more, though, I shall tell you.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>37th over: South Africa 129-3 (Kallis 8, Prince 8)</strong> \"Judging by Michael Holding's unnecessary pedantry at Bumble's expense this morning, he might also complain that in a world of political correctness the third man position should be called third person, which would explain why Vaughan would always have one,\" says Ian Copestake. Good work, sir; gags that combine cricket and the finer points of grammar are few and far between.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>38th over: South Africa 133-3 (Kallis 8, Prince 12)</strong> Harmison is trying to bounce Ashwell Prince out, and it's not quite working yet. The batsman does a little dance to avoid the first one, clouts the next one for four, and finishes by waving his wrists and edging towards slip.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>39th over: South Africa 138-3 (Kallis 9, Prince 16)</strong> Oh, flukey inside edge from Prince, which narrowly misses the stumps, and Ambrose has even less chance of getting to that as he did to that Amla chance yesterday.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>Wicket! Kallis 9 c Collingwood b Harmison (South Africa 138-4) </strong>The happiest man at the Oval is Kevin Pietersen, who'd failed to take a relatively simple catch off Kallis the ball before. Perhaps that let-off rattled the batsman, for he edges into the slips and the safe hands of Collingwood send him packing. That's the last ball of the over, and an excellent spell for Steve Harmison, who's up and running this morning.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>41st over: South Africa 138-4 (Prince 16, de Villiers 0)</strong> \"Reassuring that we can now speak of the 'safe hands' of Collingwood,\" says Phil Booth. Paul Collingwood is one of the finest fielders of his generation, and I will brook no argument. Though he's not been the happiest of bunnies recently, I feel confident that he is now back in a groove of wonderful form.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>42nd over: South Africa 138-4 (Prince 16, de Villiers 0)</strong> That's Steve Harmison's fifth maiden of the morning, and he's getting a significantly better line than he did yesterday.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>43rd over: South Africa 142-4 (Prince 17, de Villiers 3)</strong> \"Now that Kallis has gone for a mere 9, we can conclude as Vic Marks suggested in today's paper that he's had a miserable Test series with the bat,\" writes Nick Terdre. He certainly has. I was half-expecting him to remedy that in this match, seeing as everyone else is gaily making decent knocks, but he's looked very poor. Broad comes back on for this over, and AB de Villiers opens his account by cover-driving a full, widish one.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>44th over: South Africa 142-4 (Prince 17, de Villiers 3)</strong> It's a double bowling change, with Andrew Flintoff, about whom I keep vaguely forgetting, taking the ball for his first spell if the day. \"As even Pietersen's mistakes turn out positively, shouldn't he be immediately elevated to leader of the free world (I exclude the unfree world only as I guess they wouldn't agree)?\" asks Ian Copestake. \"Failing that he should at least play the lottery this week.\" I don't think KP's short of a shilling or two, Ian, but I was certainly thinking something similar a day or two ago. He's just one of those unfailingly brash, positive players to whom good things seem to happen, and even when bad things happen, he somehow turns it into an advantage. Probably a good person to have as captain, then.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>45th over: South Africa 148-4 (Prince 22, de Villiers 4)</strong> A tidy over from Broad concludes with some nonsensically wide stuff, which Ashwell Prince nearly needs to take a bus to get anywhere near, but he makes contact and clouts it for four.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>46th over: South Africa 150-4 (Prince 22, de Villiers 6)</strong> A bouncer from Flintoff makes de Villiers panic - he doesn't know whether to play or whether to duck, and in the end he decides to lean back and get whacked on the grille. Re Ian Copestake's suggestion that Kevin Pietersen should be leader of the free world, Phil Booth has some concerns. \"Pietersen's positivity may attract luck,\" she says, \"but I would hesitate before actually giving him control of armed forces - Flintoff notwithstanding. One can only imagine a smart start followed by getting out for 13 with an ill-conceived swing at Tehran and having to mope back to the pavilion looking a little sheepish.\"</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>47th over: South Africa 151-4 (Prince 23, de Villiers 6)</strong> The debate on Kevin Pietersen's four-leaf-clover-laden life continues. \"Napoleon famously remarked he preferred his generals to be lucky, rather than good,\" says John Starbuck. \"Not that we usually pay much attention to Napoleonic views when discussing cricket, but there you go. Perhaps we should?\"</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>48th over: South Africa 151-4 (Prince 23, de Villiers 6)</strong> Gary Naylor wants to know: \"Once the Test finishes, is there any chance of KP popping over to Beijing to pick up a Phelpsian fistful of medals?\" But what events would he compete in? Or are you not fussy? Flintoff continues, while David Lloyd presses the case of Panesar up in the commentary box, asking Nasser Hussain: \"Would you not have just had a look? Into the rough areas?\" Hussain replies with a flat-out no. Then when Lloyd points out that Ashwell Prince has struggled against spin, he changes his mind. Typical blinkin' Hussain, he doesn't know what he wants.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>49th over: South Africa 152-4 (Prince 23, de Villiers 7)</strong> Broad's swinging it in to Prince, and lures him into swiping towards gully, but it's short of Cook, the man there. And there's Stuart Broad's dad in the crowd.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>50th over: South Africa 157-4 (Prince 23, de Villiers 8)</strong> De Villiers does a little shimmy to avoid a Flintoff bouncer, but it still strikes him on the back, and that's got to sting. The fact that they get four leg-byes for it, though, might make him feel better.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>51st over: South Africa 161-4 (Prince 24, de Villiers 11)</strong> Kevin Pietersen is clearly of the David Lloyd school of thought rather than the Nasser Hussain, but he's bowling first off to de Villiers from the Vauxhall End. As dear old Bumble pointed out, he'll be looking to get into Ashwell Prince, as there's a patch of rough outside the left-hander's off-stump.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>Wicket! Prince 24 c Strauss b Flintoff (South Africa 161-5)</strong> It's not the spin that does for Prince, but the pace and bounce enticing him to flash, and it's an easy take in the slips for Andrew Strauss.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>52nd over: South Africa 163-5 (de Villiers 11, Boucher 1)</strong> Nasser Hussain is attempting to wax philosophical about Steve Harmison: \"They can't live with him, they can't live without him. Love him or hate him, he does affect the balance of the side.\" He also misuses the word 'pamper', but let's overlook that to ask a more pertinent question - does anyone genuinely hate Steve Harmison? He seems such a lovely affable chap.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>53rd over: South Africa 163-5 (de Villiers 11, Boucher 1)</strong> David Lloyd doesn't understand why Monty Panesar doesn't have an arm ball. \"It's not particularly difficult,\" he says. \"He should have one. He's got such long fingers.\"</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>54th over: South Africa 164-5 (de Villiers 12, Boucher 1)</strong> A muted shout from Andrew Flintoff against Mark Boucher, but nothing from behind the stumps, and that's because the batsman hit only the ground - he was nowhere near the ball at all.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>55th over: South Africa 168-5 (de Villiers 16, Boucher 1)</strong> De Villiers makes better use of the rough than Panesar, picking up on the turn and cutting through cover for four. And that's lunch. A good morning for New England Captain Kevin Pietersen and his men, with South Africa effectively resuming after lunch on 46-5. Join us then!</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>Afternoon all</strong>. Well, this could be all over by tea-time.</p> <p><strong>LUNCH</strong></p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>Anyone else feeling guilty?</strong> We shouldn't really be doing this, should we?

Not right at all.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>56th over: South Africa 170-5 (de Villiers 15, Boucher 3)</strong><br>Harmison beats the edge first up, with Boucher fishing like a regular Bob Nudd. Apologies if things are a little sketchy this afternoon - I'm watching events at The Oval on the world'd darkest television, with no obvious way to improve the contrast/brightness.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>57th over: South Africa 170-5 (de Villiers 15, Boucher 3)</strong><br>Broad returns, but he can't tempt the stoic de Villers. Maiden over.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>58th over: South Africa 170-5 (de Villiers 15, Boucher 3)</strong><br>Leave, leave, leave, duck, leave, leave ... England are still mentally tucking into their lunchtime pork pies, scotch eggs and sundry fried potato-based snacks.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>59th over: South Africa 171-5 (de Villiers 16, Boucher 3)</strong><br>Big appeal from Broad has he gets one to swing a touch back into the right-handed de Villiers. The batsman gets a good stride in, though, and the ball hit him just outside the line. Well worth a shout. Right, let's get political. \"Guilt about not watching the Olympics?\" writes an incredulous Tom Lawrence. \"Without wishing to get too political, I'd feel guilty if I were watching them. Mind you, boycotts are easy when 85% of the action would bore you to tears in any event.\" Anyone sharing such views, should visit our <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/aug/10/olympics.daytwo.minutebyminute\">Olympic minute-by-minute</a> and bombard Alan Gardner with emails informing him what a bad, bad person he is.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>60th over: South Africa 176-5 (de Villiers 21, Boucher 3)</strong><br>De Villiers cuts hard as Harmison drops a little short and a little wide - four runs, right out of the meat. And that's all I have to say about that.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>61st over: South Africa 184-5 (de Villiers 29, Boucher 3)</strong><br>De Villiers works a couple to leg, then celebrates with an almighty waft at a wide one from Broad. It's amazingly hushed at The Oval, seems very flat out there, but the crowd are briefly roused by a terrific cover drive from de Villiers, punishing some over-pitched garbage from Broad.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>62nd over: South Africa 186-5 (de Villiers 30, Boucher 4)</strong><br>Harmison tries to tempt de Villiers into a hook with a bit of short stuff, and the batsman is happy to oblige. He's well in control though. Harmison has been in chicken korma mode since lunch, rather than the beef madras we've seen at times in this Test.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>63rd over: South Africa 189-5 (de Villiers 30, Boucher 5)</strong><br>Broad again strays to the leg - I'm struggling to come up with the right Indian food analogy for him. Some sort of biriyani, perhaps? Think about it ... - and the batsmen ease a few singles into the on side.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>64th over: South Africa 191-5 (de Villiers 31, Boucher 6)</strong><br>Anderson returns but again struggles to spice things up, though he produces a cracking piece of fielding to keep Boucher honest as he scuttles a run. A couple of you noted that I mentioned it was hushed at Lord's a few overs ago. That's now been erased, 1984-style. It was always so.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>65th over: South Africa 195-5 (de Villiers 31, Boucher 10)</strong><br>Panesar tippy-toes in and Boucher hammers a short one for four past mid-wicket. \"Broad is the mango chutney,\" offers Fred Lane without explanation. You'll have to work that one out for yourselves.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>66th over: South Africa 199-5 (de Villiers 35, Boucher 10)</strong><br>De Villiers drives square for four good 'uns as Anderson over-pitches. Much like South Africa, it's not been the best of days for me thus far. I've managed to forget both my keys and my wallet, denying me access to the bike shed, access to the Guardian building and access to my house. I'm also denied the opportunity to sample the delights of the Guardian canteen this afternoon (though maybe that's a good thing). I have to say, I'm in a <em>reet</em> mood.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>67th over: South Africa 200-5 (de Villiers 35, Boucher 11)</strong><br>KP and Panesar have a long chat and it's to be an over of wild off-spin from the captain. Boucher brings the 200 up with a dink behind square on the leg.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>68th over: South Africa 201-5 (de Villiers 36, Boucher 11)</strong><br>Change of ends for Panesar, but he's still not getting a great deal of turn. \"If Broad is the mango chutney, then KP must be the hot lime pickle,\" suggests John Starbuck. \"Monty is the onion bhaji, looks complicated but really easy to deal with most of the time.\"</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Boucher 12 c Collingwood b Anderson (69th over: South Africa 205-6 (de Villiers 37, Morkel 4)</strong><br>Breakthrough for England! Anderson finds a bit of extra bounce and Boucher's gone. It leapt up, took the shoulder of the bat and gave Collingwood the simplest of catches. That brings Morne Morkel to the crease and Anderson's quickly into the short stuff, but the new batsman deals with it well. KP gifts him a couple of runs by shying down the stumps for no particular reason.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>70th over: South Africa 208-6 (de Villiers 39, Morkel 4)</strong><br>Panesar is rubbing his hands with delight after de Villiers takes a single and brings Morkel, for whom Panesar has been a scourge, on strike. The close fielders are up as he catches the pad with the last ball of the over, but the umpire is unmoved. \"Bell's the poppadum,\" offers Angus Doulton. \"Looks lovely but is brittle.\"</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>71st over: South Africa 215-6 (de Villiers 42, Morkel 8)</strong><br>England tinker with the field, setting a variety of traps for Morkel - he responds by carting Anderson over the top for a one-bounce four.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>72nd over: South Africa 217-6 (de Villiers 43, Morkel 9)</strong><br>\"Gow!\" yelps Ambrose for no obvious reason, as Panesar turns one into Morkel's pads. De Villiers then dances down the pitch and attempts a monstrous moo over the top, but fails to make contact. Luckily his pads do, though would you back Ambrose to make the stumping?</p> <!-- Block 54 -->       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3c7dONn9cNo?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <object width=\"460\" height=\"385\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/3c7dONn9cNo&hl=en&fs=1\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><embed src=\"https://www.youtube.com/v/3c7dONn9cNo&hl=en&fs=1\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"460\" height=\"385\"></embed></object> </figure>   <p><strong>73rd over: South Africa 218-6 (de Villiers 43, Morkel 10)</strong><br>Right, I need some energy. The sort of energy that only Lionel Richie and a pair of remarkable trousers can provide ... ahhh, that's better. Flintoff returns and Morkel survives an inside edge onto his legs before working a single and reaching the safe haven of the non-strikers end. De Villiers gets down on one knee and attempts an ugly cross-batted swipe. He's clearly trying to get on with things.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>WICKET! Morkel 10 c Bell b Panesar (74th over: South Africa 218-7 (de Villiers 43, Morkel 10)</strong><br>Panesar strikes and Morkel is the victim once more, the ball flicking the top of the pad, brushing the glove and popping up to Bell at short leg. I'm going to credit half that wicket to Monty and half to Lionel, who rarely fails to produce the goods. Harris is up next - there could be some fireworks from de Villiers imminently.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>75th over: South Africa 228-7 (de Villiers 52, Harris 0)</strong><br>Another huge appeal as Flintoff's attempted yorker zeros in on Harris's pads. It's drifting just wide of leg stump, however. De Villiers then feathers one down the leg side for four and pings a boundary off the inside egde to bring up his half century and the 100 lead for South Africa.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>76th over: South Africa 228-7 (de Villiers 52, Harris 0)</strong><br>\"Re cricketers as Indian food,\" writes Gary Naylor. \"Is Steve Harmison a dhal? Can be very tasty, but can also produce a surprising amount of ...\" Yes, we'll stop that right there. Harris plays out a maiden from Panesar.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>77th over: South Africa 231-7 (de Villiers 53, Harris 2)</strong><br>England give de Villiers the single, so Flintoff's got five balls at Harris (who when under a helmet looks even more like a lost member of Def Leppard). He clips one away to leg for two runs, and just about survives the rest.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>78th over: South Africa 233-7 (de Villiers 54, Harris 3)</strong><br>South Africa take the lead up to 111 with a couple of quick singles - at what point do England start feeling a little nervous? 150-plus?</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>79th over: South Africa 233-7 (de Villiers 54, Harris 3)</strong><br>Harris digs out another attempted yorker from Flintoff, then takes one on the helmet. Another maiden - Harris doing is usual irritatingly-immovable-object job very well.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>80th over: South Africa 241-7 (de Villiers 62, Harris 3)</strong><br>De Villiers sweeps majestically for four then belts a long hop for another as Panesar hops and skips his way in once more. That'll surely be it for Monty for a while, with the new ball set to be taken.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>81st over: South Africa 249-7 (de Villiers 67, Harris 5)</strong><br>Anderson returns with the new cherry. De Villiers flings the bat at it. Edge. Through the slips. Four. Frustration for England. Short sentences. They're great, aren't they? Feel like Hemingway. Sort of.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>82nd over: South Africa 255-7 (de Villiers 72, Harris 6)</strong><br>De Villiers has shown great faith in his lower-order partners so far and he takes a single off the first ball to give Harmison five at Harris with the ball just one over old. That faith is rewarded though as Harris adds another single to the total - they all count, and the target is creeping up all the time. AB helps himself to four more with a sort of short-armed cut, but Harmison beats the bat with the last ball - good contest.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>83rd over: South Africa 258-7 (de Villiers 73, Harris 7)</strong><br>Harris has battled hard here - he got a whack on the head from Flintoff a few overs ago and now his evasive action as Anderson throws in a bouncer sees him end up on his backside, legs in the air like an overturned beetle. Seems to be enjoying the challenge, though. Sky's camera's pan across the <em>real</em> sky and focus upon a looming cloud that on this television looks like some sort of Doomsday cumulonimbus. I'm sure it's not that bad.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>84th over: South Africa 264-7 (de Villiers 75, Harris 12)</strong><br>In his eagerness for a wicket, Harmison gets too straight on Harris and is worked away through leg for a couple of couples. \"Edge. Through slips. Four,\" muses Phil Booth. \"More Gordon Ramsey giving recipe instructions that Hemingway.\" Ruddy 'eck, give me a little more credit than that, surely?</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>85th over: South Africa 265-7 (de Villiers 76, Harris 12)</strong><br>Panesar back for the last over before tea, and Ambrose thinks he's got a stumping with the final ball. Replays show Harris's back foot anchored in his crease. And that's tea. Be sure to join Carrie after the break for what could be an intriguing evening session.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>TEA</strong></p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>86th over: South Africa 272-7 (de Villiers 77, Harris 18)</strong> We're into what should theoretically be an extended final session of the day, although the black clouds hovering over this glorious city may curtail it yet. So two and a half hours of brilliantly positive cricket from England and their New Captain, and I am expecting similarly optimistic comments from you, dear readers. This is a brand-new era! Harris and de Villiers are proving an awkward partnership - 54 runs for this eighth wicket so far, with four of them added to Harris's haul as he flicks a straight Harmison ball through midwicket.</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>87th over: South Africa 273-7 (de Villiers 78, Harris 18)</strong> Flintoff's sharing bowling duties this evening, and de Villiers is watchful and deliberate in defence.</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>88th over: South Africa 282-7 (de Villiers 82, Harris 18)</strong> If anyone boos Tim Ambrose for the five wides that have just been chalked on to the tourists' tally, I shall smite them. A ludicrous amount of bounce from Harmison; the wicketkeeper had no chance. And although the bowler dampens it down slightly for the next ball, it's still down the legside and it's a four for de Villiers.</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>89th over: South Africa 284-7 (de Villiers 82, Harris 20)</strong> Some chin music for Paul Harris as Andrew Flintoff terrorises him, and the crowd are whooping in anticipation. Harris looks bewildered, as well he might, but manages to play an attempted yorker for two.</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>90th over: South Africa 287-7 (de Villiers 85, Harris 20)</strong> Good footwork from Panesar prevents another four for de Villiers, this time off Anderson, which prompts David Lloyd to wonder what football team he supports. \"He's from Northampton. Maybe he follows the Cobblers,\" he guesses. NO. He's from LUTON. He supports LUTON. Someone clearly has a word in Bumble's ear, because he quickly corrects himself and saves me sending a disgruntled email. Those with keen hearing can hear Kevin Pietersen bellowing, \"They're 160 for seven here, guys!\"</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>91st over: South Africa 290-7 (de Villiers 86, Harris 22)</strong> \"AAAAAH!\" shouts Andrew Flintoff as he strikes Harris on the pads, but it's going well over. And on that topic, here's Gary Naylor: \"Can anyone in OBOland volunteer a reason why Flintoff gets (relatively) so few wickets? That Ntini, a wholehearted but limited trier, has 150 more wickets than Flintoff at a significantly better strike rate is amazing. Even Nel takes his wickets at a better rate than Fred.\"</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>92nd over: South Africa 299-7 (de Villiers 93, Harris 24)</strong> \"Anyone have a nasty feeling that the South Africans are getting to the point where they might actually be able to defend their total and finish the series 3-0?\" No, Nick Jones, we're having none of that negativity/pessimism/realism here. AB de Villiers is cracking on into the nervous 90s now.</p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>93rd over: South Africa 304-7 (de Villiers 94, Harris 28)</strong> Panesar's back on, over the wicket. John Starbuck wants to know: \"Supposing England have to make 200-odd, how many (and how fast) will save Strauss's place?\" I think we should focus on taking these last three wickets first.</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>94th over: South Africa 307-7 (de Villiers 95, Harris 30)</strong> Phil Booth assesses Flintoff's relatively poor strike-rate thus: \"Quality, not quantity, of wickets, perhaps - he has the ability to take the big ones, the psychologically important ones - viz 'that over' in the Ashes etc.\" Mm, take the point. I guess fitness and work overload has something to do with it too. Stuart Broad's back on now, and if Ian Bell was six inches taller he'd have caught Paul Harris off an edge towards leg.</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>95th over: South Africa 308-7 (de Villiers 96, Harris 30)</strong> \"I think Kevin Pietersen has done well,\" booms Sir Ian Botham, but then he would say that. Interesting idea from Nick Jones with regard to Andrew Flintoff: \"I think it's because he's too accurate. The batsman knows it will be there or thereabouts and is generally looking to defend or leave alone; with other bowlers where the line and length vary more, the batsman is drawn to play shots by the bad balls, and will get out when the ball isn't quite as bad as he thinks it is.\"</p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p><strong>Wicket! Harris 34 c Flintoff b Broad (South Africa 313-8)</strong> And Paul Harris's valiant resistance comes to an end. He's furious with his careless edge, but it's been a stout and sterling effort.</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>96th over: South Africa 313-8 (de Villiers 97, Nel 0)</strong> Apparently Paul Harris is cross because it's too dark at the Oval. Aleem Dar is poised with the lightmeter. \"Pietersen's faith in Broad justified,\" says David Gower.</p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>Wicket! de Villiers 97 b Panesar (South Africa 313-9)</strong> AB de Villiers keeps walking about three metres out of his crease to meet Panesar down the track - presumably because he wants to reach his 100 and doesn't trust Nel or Ntini to help him on his way there - and his foolhardiness is rewarded as the bowler gets some vicious turn and takes him out.</p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p><strong>98th over: South Africa 314-9 (Nel 1, Ntini 0)</strong> Stuart Broad serves up a snarling bouncer to Nel, and then attempts to stare him out. However, Broad even at his most menacing looks about as intimidating as the bouncing baby golden retriever he normally resembles, whereas Andre Nel is a bit scary all the time, frankly.</p> <!-- Block 82 --> <p><strong>99th over: South Africa 317-9 (Nel 2, Ntini 2)</strong> Interesting point from Jeremy Douglas: \"I think Flintoff's figures are affected by the longish period at the beginning of his Test career when he wasn't really very good. I remember a friend referring to him at the time as 'the new David Capel' (with considerable statistical justification). I suspect if you looked at his performance over, say, 2004-present they'd look a lot better.\" If anyone wants to do the relevant calculations, do feel free to send them over. I'm busy typing.</p> <!-- Block 83 --> <p><strong>Wicket! Ntini 2 c Collingwood b Broad (South Africa 318 all out)</strong> A well-taken catch from Paul Collingwood, down at the ground, and as Gary Naylor pointed out slightly prematurely, these will be difficult conditions for Andrew Strauss to bat for his career, effectively. South Africa have a lead of 197 runs.</p> <!-- Block 84 --> <p><strong>1st over: England 0-0 (Strauss 0, Cook 0)</strong> So here we go, and Andrew Strauss is facing Morne Morkel in the south-of-the-river gloom. He'll be happy to see out the first over, even if he hasn't notched up any runs.</p> <!-- Block 85 --> <p><strong>2nd over: England 0-0 (Strauss 0, Cook 0)</strong> And it's just started to rain at the Oval. Andrew Strauss is glaring at the umpires, who convene in the middle, wave the lightmeter, and promptly offer the light. Strauss and Alastair Cook say, \"Thank you very much\", and scamper off.</p> <!-- Block 86 --> <p><strong>Some statistics </strong>Gary Naylor has done some good counting for us: \"Flintoff's last 32 Tests have brought him 127 wickets at 28.21 at a strike rate of 54.6. His first 38 Tests brought him 79 wickets at 38.64 at a strike rate of 80.4. So a definite improvement, but even the second half of his career puts him no better than Ntini's career average of 28.22 at a strike rate of 52.3. Flintoff really should produce more.\" As has Edward Genochio: \"Since 2004 - 154 wickets at 27.7, strike rate 54.3; before 2004: 52 wickets at 45.5, strike rate 94.7. Overall: 204 wickets at 32.08, strike rate 64.2.\"</p> <!-- Block 87 --> <p><strong>Weather update</strong> It's bucketing down in London, the skies are dark, and David Gower is still talking about getting the players back on soon.</p> <!-- Block 88 --> <p><strong>More on Flintoff</strong> Here's Gareth Fitzgerald: \"Ntini has been ranked in the world's top ten consistently for the last five years. For one English bowler to produce a comparable record would be a godsend. Botham's bowling figures are similar. If Flintoff produces wickets at 28 a piece for the next few years that will do nicely.\"</p> <!-- Block 89 --> <p><strong>Another weather update </strong>It's much brighter now, but the ground is drenched, so it depends on whether the ground can be made fit for play quickly enough for a restart. The Oval turf is famously good at draining quickly, though.</p> <!-- Block 90 --> <p><strong>Play abandoned for the day </strong>The umpires have decided that the mopping-up operation will take too long, and the ground staff say that it'll be better for everyone if we just pack up for the day and start again in the morning. I must say it's nice of them to consider those of us with fifth-day tickets. So Andrew Strauss and Alastair Cook will resume tomorrow chasing that lead of 197 and a consolation win in this dead rubber. Thanks for your company today.</p>",

It is clean at the point of use (which is why you, Panorama and lots of other people presumably think it is environmentally friendly) but mostly it is generated using fossil fuels - and this is the problem. Somewhere, typically miles away from the user, is a power station belching out CO2 and NOx. Typically, electricity is no more than 20% efficient because of losses in the power station and distribution losses so 80% is wasted. So it is worse than gas and an electric car is far worse, for example, than a diesel in terms of CO2 emissions expressed as grams/km. So please stop perpetuating the myth that electricity is a clean fuel. Global warming is such an important topic that the public deserve to be well informed. John Miles, Professor School of Engineering, Cardiff University</p> <p>&gt;&gt; A lot of time and blather is being spent trying to figure out what the car of the future will run on. It would be much better spent if we'd admit there isn't a future car and that our basic assumptions about society and economics need examination. <a href=\"http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2008/08/milton-friedmans-misfortune.html\">nakedcapitalism.com</a></p> <p>&gt;&gt; Part of the setback has been the historic volatility of the electric car market and sequels to \"Who Killed the Electric Car\" playing in the nightmares of auto industry execs, which have hindered investment in lithium source exploration. A powerful assist could come from a sharp reduction in the cost of making those lithium-based batteries--that would make the cost of developing and manufacturing the vehicles significantly cheaper, and therefore less risky to the carmakers. <a href=\"http://www.plentymag.com/blogs/edge/2008/07/green_car_round_up.php\">plentymag.com</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/jul/31/microsoft.windows\">MOJAVE</a> &gt;&gt; Microsoft's 90% stranglehold on operating systems is perfectly OK on the trust-o-meter, even though it gives Europe fits. Which would be all right, if it were any damned good. But Microsoft's operating system underpins a whole menagerie of functionalities that don't function -- at least not well. What can be said about a system so vulnerable that it writes pothole-filling patches at the rate of 60 last year alone? Five a month? You can choose to call them 'security updates' or any user-friendly name you dream up, but they're still holes in the road. <a href=\"http://www.opinion-columns.com/praguewriter/2008/07/in-my-dreams-go.html\">opinion-columns.com</a></p> <p>&gt;&gt; In a study that was anything BUT scientific or double-blind, Microsoft presented a display of Vista's assets in a carefully orchestrated dog and pony show that wowed the audience.

I can understand that the user statistics are interesting to you, but there are better choices than bit.ly, which has two major flaws. First, using mixed upper and lower-case letters means I can't read and memorise the short form then type it into my browser. Second, if I set up a bookmark to bit.ly, the webpage which appears has an additional \"/go\" appended, so I can't just type the short URL on the end. XRL is worse. It replaces the bookmarked URL by an entirely different one which doesn't accept the short URL at all. Notlong is also out, since you have to type the short URL before \"notlong.com\". In short, if you don't like TinyURL, only Qurl, ElfURL and SnipURL (not in fact case-sensitive, as far as I can tell) are really user-friendly. Please, please consider using one of these! Romilly Bowden, Bognor Regis [<em>In response, we're creating simpler URLs with bit.ly - Tech.Ed</em>]</p> <p>&gt;&gt; I remember several years ago when the right answer to this was given wrong on University Challenge; but you'd think that, after all this time, The Guardian's Technology section would know what URL stands for. Tip: it's uniform, not universal. <a href=\"http://devilgate.org/blog/2008/07/31/whats-that-stand-for/\">devilgate.org</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/jul/24/news.computing\">CAN TOUCH THIS</a> With regards your discussion on whether or not touchscreen technology will take over from the mouse (or keyboard) you did not even touch (excuse the pun) on the reason touch technology has become so popular. This (in my humble option) is simply down to the emergence of \"cheap\" multi-touch displays. Multi-touch has lead to a slate of new ideas on how one can interact with modern technology, with computers unusually being one of the last to join in on this new approach (phones are way ahead at the minute) mainly for practical reasons which are currently being addressed. I agree with you when you say it is unlike to over take the keyboard in most workplace environments (at least in the near future), given you can already use your 10 fingers to work with a keyboard. This is the subtle difference between why I see touch becoming a \"mouse-killer\" and not a keyboard-killer. A mouse is so annoying and I don't know about you but it gives me a terrible pain the my \"mouse-finger\"! A touchscreen display (with an adjustable arm to move it closer to you and into a suitable position) would be far more superior given with multi touch you would now have 10 pointers to manipulate the screen rather than just the one with the mouse (imagine using a keyboard with one finger,annoying!!!). When the hardware and software is in place to take advantage of multi=touch on a PC, the touchscreen will be a \"mouse-killer\" which is already taking over accessible areas like handheld devices (i.e. mobile phones &amp; laptops). I could go on further about were I see it being used in workplaces and the likes but I won't as I've written enough already!

The potential not merely for revenue but as a platform to forge one's skills as a designer is attractive tho'.

However, if you go sideways, there are some intriguing parallels to this. Freeing data and knowledge sets allows an individual to come up with and explore new ideas. It also means that potentially some revenue will be lost if there are charges involved. Well, it's going to happen any way but one might as well accept this and work on ways of making the original source more appealing and useful. <a href=\"http://austgate.co.uk/?p=16\">austgate.co.uk</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/jul/31/politicsandtechnology\">DEAR GORDON, ENERGETICALLY YOURS</a> Your article today in the Guardian is pure plagiarism - I have been saying that for at least five years!!! I shall send a copy of your article to no 10 and ask what the PM intends to do about it. I think Miliband understands what is required slightly better than Brown. John Ellis, Llandysul</p> <p>Good letter, and similar to one my father wrote to me thirty years ago. This is the galling thing, all this has been known about for decades. I picked up a geography text book printed in '84 just recently and it pinpointed all the human problems back then, about which we have done virtually nothing: overfishing, habitat destruction, overpopulation, finite material sources, water care. The list is scary. Personally I've never had much truck with a society that puts consumerism at the top of the list and from which our wealth is apparently subservient to and quite frankly, being a bit of a part-time doom merchant, I'm reasonably happy this is all kicking off at last. After the Twin Towers were dropped one of the first things [George] Bush said was, \"keep on spending\". It rather gave the game away. You're right about [David] Cameron. Silly me, I wrote to the Tories five years back that they had to absorb environmental policies to get anywhere, so sucking the life out of the Greens and Liberals. And Labour has been such a crashing failure I find myself in a situation where I am considering a vote for the blues next time around. Saying that I shall have to sign off anonymously. Paul Scott, Eastbourne</p> <p>Finally someone who speaks a bit of common sense. We should have been acting 10 - 15 years ago on this issue. We have the greatest 'natural' resources in wind and sea power and refuse to utilise them. David Alford (no post town given)</p> <p>Why doesn't the government want individuals to generate their own energy? Because if all of us were generating our own energy from solar imagine how much revenue the government would lose from the decline in profits from the energy companies. Unless of course they come up with some clever way of taxing us for sunlight........... Paul Wake, London</p> <p>Great article, it's a shame you didn't write that to Thatcher/Major when they were destroying our energy infrastructure during their last term. Anthony Burton, Leamington Spa</p> <p>Like your drift, but the fact is that the only real solution is to go largely nuclear, urgently - I'm not against solar panels or tidal barriers, but wind farms are ugly, low-yield and pathetically unreliable. You need to be a bit more realistic in advising the \"immovable object\" on what has to be done. Investment should be put into finding a best-of-breed solution for nuclear waste storage/recycling/etc, which is the only issue worth addressing on energy policy. Oh, and the planners need to be told to stop forcing builders to install gas-fired central heating (!) and to insist on electrically-driven systems. Brian Crabtree (no post town given)</p> <p>May I just add a few thoughts to your brilliant article (I genuinely hope Gordon Brown will read it). Simply swapping coal-fire plants to renewable/green energy sources will not be enough solve the UK's energy-problem. It is the culture and the attitude that should be changed, while installing alternative energy sources. This country has been generous with energy since the industrial revolution. Once the UK was abundant in coal, wood, cheap labor in the colonised territories and industrial goods imported from its colonies. But the good, old days are over and British people seem not to realise it. Almost half of the food we buy ends up in the bins [and] Jeremy Clarkson, prophet of fuel-burning is more popular and known than any scientists or activist who design or promote green energy. Buying dirt-cheap clothes from Primark and not thinking about the consequences (where the clothes come from and who suffers from the consequences) is acceptable and a norm. Wasting energy is the very part of the UK's culture and lifestyle. I came to the UK to fulfill my dream, to study music and become a musician. After two years of living here I am full of fury and anger. You have choices and alternatives which I do not have where I am from (Hungary): with my partner we use eco-detergents and washing powder, switch of electrical devices before leave home, use public transport instead of cars, will change energy provider soon, etc. Most people in London, where I live, never get to this stage. It is the culture of 'I-want-it-and-I-want-it-now-whatever-the-price-is'. It is the culture of the Beckhams, Rooneys and Jordans. I work with poor, young people who want cars advertised on TV, fancy clothes, iPhones and gadgets. Many of them become criminals to get these goods. Again, I am full of anger. With my partner we will get married soon and want children and it is the British and Western culture that screws up my children's future. Once an excellent Guardian article about green lifestyle stated clearly: positive changes of a society start from the people, never from the government. We should not expect Gordon Brown to save us. The countdown has started and if the British society keeps wasting energy and resources, no wind farms and solar panels will save the UK. Greg Lorincz, London</p> <p>Brilliant! Couldn't have put it better myself!! Brown's only hope is to grasp the nettle and do something decisive on this critical front. Who do you blame most for this mess - the Thatcher dash for gas, energy privatisation and destruction of coal mining? Or the subsequent Labour dithering over nuclear and lack of \"carrot\" for renewables - esp solar. Surely solar panels should now be obligatory on all new housing? Is our planning permissions process so labyrinthine than nothing ever seems to get done? e.g. I remember talking about the prospect of a Severn barrage when I was at school 35 years ago. Can't see it happening until people are actually starving! Are there worthwhile pressure groups people can join? (not just Greens - I want a realistic, coherent national energy policy that includes Nuclear) Are other countries doing much better than us....think I can guess the answer! Do you think new technology can feasibly make coal fired stations Carbon neutral (ish) or is that just wishful thinking? BTW..... How do the French dispose of their nuclear waste? Anyway thanks for an inspiring and thought provoking article. Paul Sherrard, Bath</p> <p>Here are some of the major issues. 1: Energy is the nation's lifeblood and should have its own Minister of State like Defence, Health and Transport. It is quite absurd that with all the challenges to our energy supply, national &amp; international, Energy has been hived off as a subsidiary of the Department of Business, Enterprise &amp; Regulatory Reform. 2: Given that gas supply, like oil, is likely to remain in the hands of private speculators there are vital issues such as the provision of adequate gas storage facilities and the infrastructure to import store &amp; distribute LPG which need urgent review. It is by no means axiomatic that these facilities are best supplied by 'the market'. We do not, for example, expect the transport industry to build our roads. 3: Electricity is a secondary fuel but is of equal or even greater importance to oil and gas in terms of security of supply at the point of use. It is largely generated by carbon-emitting processes - about 70% of our electricity is generated in this way and despite all our efforts to develop renewables is likely to remain thereabouts for the foreseeable future. We therefore need to reduce demand for electricity. 'The market' is unable to achieve this objective. 4: Virtually all our electricity generating capacity will need to be replaced in the next 2/3 decades. Will 'the market' oblige? 5: The major primary fuels available to us for electricity generation are coal (indigenous or imported), gas (ditto) and nuclear. These all have technically feasible but very expensive waste disposal problems (CCS in the case of coal &amp; gas). Are these to be left to 'the market' to resolve? 6: The national electricity grid was built by the nationally owned Electricity Council and is now in the hands of a private company (\"National Grid\") which is responsible for the management &amp; refurbishment of the system including new connections to off-shore wind farms. Who picks up the bill? 7) In the longer term there are possible developments such as solar-generated hydrogen from North Africa which may be best coordinated by the EU but will require major government input. David Hayes, Bristol</p> <p>That was a welcome call for some more visionary leadership, but there is one aspect which needs bringing to the forefront. Invariably articles on energy seem to get trapped into comparing the alternative forms of energy resources and the methods of harnessing them and do not put the use of energy in the context of conservation, recycling and control relative to the need for energy. We have people like E-ON making a case for burning coal on the basis of false claims that otherwise our energy requirements will not be met - virtually trying to blackmail us into accepting their use of coal CO2 energy capture 'or else' - and claiming that energy conservation will not reduce demand sufficiently to avoid enduring reliance on fossil fuels. 'We cannot conserve our way out of the energy crisis or global warming' seems to be their mantra. The truth is that we have simply build our lives around a profligate use of primary energy from fossil fuels that everything is designed without thought of conservation or recycling of heat and power or the use of freely available ambient energy sources. Since in order to survive, let alone enjoy a sustainable civilized way of life, we are going to have to learn to operate within the limits of resources and without spoiling our habitat, we still have to abandon on sustainable energy systems and adapt to the use of infinite clean energy resources, and to simply stop wasting heat and power. The technology is there - it has been keeping space stations operating for years now - but it is not space science, and more importantly after the initial capital investment it is virtually free. Because highly energy efficient products, buildings and processes are relatively new, and there is no established sustainable development industry at this stage, that initial capital investment is going to be relatively expensive. There are no fundamental reasons though why they should be more expensive than current systems - there are no particularly rare or expensive materials or processes involved and most of them are readily available and in use already. As far as buildings are concerned for instance the basic conservation measures of thermal insulation, air-tightness, ventilation control can be met with cheap materials and good detailing - and almost remove the need for space heating altogether and together with the use of energy efficient lighting and equipment reduce heat and power requirements by 70% to 90% - putting the energy demand well within the capability of alternative energy systems.

Companies holding licenses to operate WiMAX at the moment are simply not showing the imagination and drive of the first Wi-Fi operators which made that technology such a success. The result - people will miss out on technology that really could make a difference to them. Daniel Heery, Alston</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/aug/01/filesharing.tv?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=technology\">TV AND FILESHARING</a> I was shocked to just read your article equating TV show filesharing with music filesharing. It smacks of jumping on the bandwagon and dangerously stoking flames of an issue that is already ridiculously misunderstood and manhandled. It's inaccurate and poorly argued. \"Did you notice how The Dark Knight came out at the same time all over the world?\" It didn't. You argue for half the article that TV filesharing is terrible for creators and TV channels, and then sulkily admit that it may help shows after all. The issues are different. I disagree music piracy has the impact it's hyped to have, but I'll play along for now. With music, you get a lossless copy. With TV shows, you get a TV recording with TV channel icons littered over the screen. So it's not exactly the same product. TV piracy is out of a certain necessity, music is not. You acknowledge that TV has borders, and that's the main reason for most people's piracy. Music is usually released at the same time, so there is less excuse for it. TV piracy does not cause viewing figures to drop. In my real world experience, buzz created by people who've seen a show before it airs on TV has led other to watch. I myself started a long chain of people to have an interest in Lost, back when I first heard about it after seeing a preview on an American DVD I bought. All the people I told about it watched it when it was on terrestrial TV and bought the DVDs, and they told more people. Every show I've pirated, I own the DVD of, and watch on TV when I get the chance. The Battlestar Galactica reboot owes its success to piracy. This is acknowledged by the producers. The people who care enough about TV shows care enough about them to purchase them on DVD and watch them when they come on TV in their country. Last year, and maybe this year, producers admitted they leaked pilots to generate buzz. Why are new shows leaked but somehow episodes of new seasons manage to stay in the can? Piracy would still occur if TV was borderless, but people would download them at a fraction of what they do now. The piracy of TV in the UK would be dramatically reduced if shows were aired simultaneously, and everyone could access legal streaming sites like Hulu. But no, there are artificial borders. The entertainment site Digital Spy has forums, on which one viewer of Heroes created a topic called \"No more downloading\" because the BBC had secured rights to air the new series a couple of days after the US. \"Doctor Who is very popular in the US\". It's also one of the few British programs that US people like to pirate. Why is it popular then? Surely it shouldn't be popular by your estimations of the effect you think piracy has? Your conclusion that there are going to be more reality programmes is possibly correct, but not for the reasons you give. Unfortunately, people still watch them and the credit crunch means channels will have smaller budgets. If they believed people would watch them as much as drama, soaps etc, Channel 4, 5 etc would make all their programmes reality-based. More cost-effective. Nothing to do with piracy. Your ultimate conclusion I agree with, that TV needs to stop with its borders, but most of everything else is inarticulate and going in different directions. You suggest they should release low quality versions so they'll want the DVD... but that happens anyway; anyone who cares enough to download gigabytes of a TV shows will want the DVD. Oh dear.

  "<p>Security is to be increased at tourist attractions around Beijing after the father-in-law of the US men's volleyball coach was murdered and his wife seriously injured at a popular site in the city yesterday.</p> <p>Wang Wei, vice-president of the Beijing organising committee, said today that increased security checks - including searches for weapons - will be instituted at \"scenic sites\" around the city.</p> <p>He stressed, however, that Beijing was \"a safe city\" and that the murder, at the Drum Tower, during which a Chinese national attacked the two Americans and their tour guide before committing suicide by leaping from the second floor of the building, was an unusual incident.</p> <p>\"After this stabbing happened it is our intention to strengthen security in scenic spots, and we may add checks to ensure that no weapons are being brought into these areas.

  "<p>An audience 3,000 strong sits rapt in attention, silenced by the spectacle about to unfold. In the middle of the round is a raised stage, 14 metres long and two metres wide. On it, two women stand three yards apart. In the dark air of the auditorium the tips of their swords glisten in the spotlight. They face each other, half-crouching, legs cocked, right arm hanging loose behind the back, the left thrusting a sabre towards the other's face. The referee mutters the magic word, and the fight begins, the blades flashing bronze and silver as they flicker in and out of the light.</p> <p>OK, cut. I'm getting a little carried away. But I've just seen my first live Olympic medal being won, and it was so unexpectedly entertaining that I'm struggling to control my fingers as they type.</p> <p>I hear they weren't showing the women's individual sabre on the BBC. I can't think why not. Beautiful, talented, women fighting with swords. What's not to like? It's pure theatre.<br> Fencing is so much more than simple swordplay, each parry, thrust and counter is accompanied by hysteric dramatics. They are as much for the referee's sake as the audience's.</p> <p>When hits are simultaneous, the blows invariably too quick for the untrained eye to catch, both fencers will turn towards the referee and try to con him that they made first contact. They clench their fist and punch the air, often they screaming in strained triumph.</p> <p>The Beijing organising committee has keyed into the drama of the event. Given that the director of the opening ceremony was Zhang Yimou, the man who made House of Flying Daggers, they could hardly fail to grasp this opportunity. The spotlit platform, the dimmed lighting, the booming music between bouts, all were calibrated to enhance the entertainment.</p> <p>Between the semi-final and the bronze play-off match \u2013 a break of only 10 minutes, each of them ticked off by a countdown clock in the corner \u2013 a troupe of performers, eight women entwined in ribbon and two men, presented a traditional sword dance.</p> <p>As bewitching as that was, it had nothing on the contest proper. The Chinese had prepared the stage, and they had four genuine divas to fill it. The cast included three Americans, one the world No1, one the Olympic champion, and the other the 2006 world champion. Completing the quartet was Sofiya Velikaya, a squat but statuesque Russian, the lowest seed of the four.</p> <p>The large contingent chanting \"U-S-A! U-S-A!\" aside, there was no doubt the crowd were supporting Velikaya, the only athlete between the US and a clean sweep of all three medals.</p> <p>Having taken an early lead in the first semi, the Russian was overhauled by the No1 seed and bronze medallist from Athens 2004, Sada Jacobson. Just 25-years old and from a family of Olympians, she was the coolest and calmest of the four.</p> <p>Her screams when hit were less pronounced, and rather than flounce between rounds she stood still, gathering her thoughts in quiet isolation. <br>In that she was the exact opposite of her team-mate Becca Ward, a<br>precocious, almost brattish 18-year-old, who was world champion in 2006 and is a hot favourite for the gold.</p> <p>Ward doesn't so much scream as whine and howl when struck. She stamps her foot when she disagrees with a decision but swings to the referee like a catwalk model when she feels she's made a hit.</p> <p>Ward is beaten by the third American, reigning Olympic champion Mariel Zagunis, who went on to beat Jacobson in the final. The Americans know each other too well, are two familiar with each other's styles.</p> <p>Their duels flow back and forth along the piste like old Errol Flynn movies. Zagunis, seemingly drawing on her experience from Athens, is too quick, too competent for her team-mates. The final is one-sided in her favour. She wins easily and this bothers me because I'd been supporting Jacobson on the grounds that the Princess Bride was her favourite movie as a kid. What better reason to get into fencing?</p> <p>The real treat was the bronze medal match between Velikaya and Ward, the crowd's fervour split roughly 75:25 in favour of the first. The Chinese spectators did not want the Americans to complete the clean sweep, and they met each point Ward won with jeering anger.</p> <p>Velikaya raced into a 7-1 lead. Ward, still shocked by her defeat in the semis, snapped out of her languor in the break between rounds. She began to charge the Russian, squealing and yelping after each point she pulled back. She went 13-11 up, Velikaya won the next two points and minutes later the match was 14 apiece. The next hit was the winner.</p> <p>Velikaya stopped, removed her helmet and then her hair band, loosing her long black locks over her back. She runs her hand through them, tossed her head as though she were advertising Timotei and then turns back to her opponent. Ward was waiting, poised. A flash of swords and then Ward makes the hit and the green light flashes. Velikaya's gamesmanship does her no good.</p> <p>The Americans have their 1, 2, 3 and most of the crowd goes very quiet indeed. Until, that is, they file out in a hubbub of noise and appreciation at what they've just seen.</p>",

One world. One dream. Welcome to day two of the Beijing Olympics.</p> <p>We'll have live coverage, blogs, comment and instant response to all the breaking news right here throughout the night. According to my trusty, colour-coded timetable that I spent all afternoon trying to decode, there'll be over 20 sports to run the rule over in the next eight hours and 12 gold medals to be won.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>02.05am: </strong>Politics schmolitics. Georgia's athletes spoke out today against Russia's ''deliberate strategy of aggression'' and President Mikhail Saakashvili has told them all to stay at the Games, despite the ongoing conflict. </p> <p>First question of the night: Has a war ever broken out on the first day of the Olympics before? Or, indeed, during the Games themselves? If sport is war by other means, watch out for Wednesday's beach volleyball clash between Russia and Georgia\u2026</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>02.15am: Britwatch</strong> The final session of dressage gets under way in Hong Kong after a rain delay. As things stand Australia are in top spot followed by Germany and the United States with Britain in fourth. With one session left to go, Tina Cook is the best placed Briton in 10th, with Sharon Hunt 14th, William Fox-Pitt 30th and Daisy Dick 32nd.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>02.25am:</strong> Click <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/10/olympicsgymnastics.olympics20082\">here</a> to read about Louis Smith's journey from hyperactive 'Loopy Lou' to pommel horse Olympic finalist.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>02 40am:</strong> An email finally arrives. ''For those of us distinctly underwhelmed by Dressage at the best of times, are you planning to give us minute-by-minute updates on the Water polo starting at 2:30? Water polo coverage via the medium of text, that's what I'd like to see. And I'm sure you made up those last two names in the dressage as well. You must think we are stupid,'' complains the mundanely-named Andrew Walters. </p> <p>If the television shows it, we will cover it. But our fate is in the pro-horsey BBC's hands, i'm afraid.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>02.43am: Dressage</strong> - Mary King is up next, the last of the British team.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>02.45am:</strong> ''Hold it together, Mary!'' exclaims the cut-glass accented commentator. ''Brilliant extended trots!'', he then adds with gusto. Final score: 38.1! Britain are 12 marks closer to the Australians.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>02.50am: Balding Watch</strong> - Conor O'Kane is wondering about Clare Balding. ''Does anyone know if she bases her hairstyle on Edward Fox's in The Day Of The Jackal? The parting is slightly higher than his, but the volume and sweep are exactly the same. Sort of like a well conditioned Shredded Wheat.''</p> <p>I think we need some documentary evidence to settle this. Give me 10 minutes.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>02.54am: Swimming</strong> - Phelps is up in five minutes or so. He's going for his first gold in the 400m individual medley final.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>02.59am:</strong> Phelps's main competition will come from fellow American, Ryan Lochte. George Bush is in position at the Water Cube. Go on the Hungarian Laszlo Cseh! Seriously. He's good.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>03.04am:</strong> They start with the butterfly. Phelps is half a second under his world record pace. Bald-headed Cseh doesn't need a swimming cap. He's in second. Lochte is close by.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>03:07am:</strong> Cseh and Lochte need to make the move now. Phelps is too strong in the freestyle. A world record is likely.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>03.09am: GOLD for Phelps in the 400m individual medley.</strong> A new world record. Only seven more to go, then ... Cseh takes a surprise silver, and Lochte bronze.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>03.16am:</strong> Just minutes after Phelps's first gold, Rick emails in to gripe and carp and so on: ''In order to truly say Phelps is bettering Mark Spitz's record, shouldn't Phelps regrow his moustache? I mean Spitz was giving the other guys a bit of a chance with his facial fuzz masterpiece, said to have increased his weight by at least 2lbs, so lush and absorbent as it was. That's not to mention the friction factor.''</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>03.18am: Team GB</strong> - Still at the pool: Jemma Lowe equals the British record (57.78sec) to finish fourth in her 100m fly semi-final. She's made the final as 6th fastest, having only just sneaked into that semi.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>03.24am:</strong> Another final at the Cube. Australia's Grant Hackett, having lost out to Thorpe four years ago (no shame there), is up against South Korean sensation Park Tae-Hwa in the men's 400m freestyle. There's a young Beijinger in there, too. He could make history.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>03.29am:</strong> Park's got 10 years over the 28-year-old Hackett. He's watching him all the way. They're level at 200m.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>03.31am: Park wins gold in the 400m freestyle</strong>. The South Korean stretches away at the 200m mark. It looks like he could have gone too early but he sustains the break and the 18-year-old wins it. Zhang Lin from China makes a late burst and gets silver. Bronze goes to the American Larsen Jensen, and Hackett languishes in 5th. George Bush waves his flag again.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>03.37am:</strong> Coda to that 400m. ''Hackett shouldn't feel too bad,'' chirps Billy Paxton. ''He's the husband of Australian singer-songwriter Candice Alley. He has a songwriting credit on her last album and is the only other credited writer besides Alley, so despite this poor result tonight he has the consolation of another career to fall back on.'' Yes, I suppose they can pool their resources. </p> <p>Sorry.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Phelps is on the podium, hand on heart, eyes moistening. Bush looks pretty happy too.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>03.44: Team GB</strong> Two days after her 19th birthday, Hannah Miley is up next in the 400m individual medley final. She's in lane eight. But American Katie Hoff is the favourite.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>03.52am:</strong> Australia's Stephanie Rice makes the strongest start. But the Hoff is still there. This would be an incredible late comeback. 'Smiley Miley', as the typically imaginative British press have dubbed her, is a long way back.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>03.52am: Stephanie Rice wins gold and sets a new world record</strong> (4:29:45). And she lets off a primal scream/woop as she does it. The Zimbabwean Kirsty Coventry takes silver and Hoff gets bronze. Miley is in 6th - and it's a poor time, well off her best. 'Smiley Miley' lives up to her (awful) nickname - the British press: the best in the world - by giving a very cheerful interview afterwards. She's still got the 200m to look forward to.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>03.58am: Men's Basketball</strong> - Russia beat Iran 71-49, with the naturalised American JR Holden scoring 19 points. That ain't Olympism, surely.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>04.00am:</strong> Zhang Lin gets a huge cheer on the podium - he's the first Chinese man to win an Olympic medal in the pool. The South Korean anthem then blares out for Park Tae-Hwa.</p> <p><strong>Bush Watch:</strong> Word reaches me across the newsdesk that George Bush stumbled in the stands at the Water Cube. Must have been all that overly vigorous flag-waving. If there's a photo of him on his keester, I'll find it.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>04.08am:</strong> It's raining in Beijing, delaying the start of the tennis. But acid showers don't put off the male volleyball players: China beat Austria 2-0.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>04.14am: Team GB</strong> - Chris Cook finishes 7th in the 100m breaststroke semi-final in 1:00:81. It's one second off his personal best and he doesn't make the final. ''I'm just not on form. That time should have been easy for me to do,'' he says afterwards.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>04.19am: Men's handball</strong> Defending champions Croatia beat Spain 31-29.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>04.23am:</strong> I asked for emails to lift my Olympic spirits. Instead I receive this from Tom Stone, who's obviously under the absurd illusion that human rights are more important than Yngling: ''The Beijing Olympics are a disgrace. Don't watch it, don't blog about it, don't acknowledge it is happening - without at least first thinking about what this the world's greatest sport's event is supposed to represent.''</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>04.26: Brit Watch</strong> - Another final in the pool. Britain's women are in lane eight for the 4x100m freestyle relay, the slowest qualifiers. China were the fastest. You make the prediction.</p> <p>I could be mishearing things. The BBC commentators were questioning whether Stephanie Rice was an underwear model or not. Adrian Moorhouse reckons she would be very good at it: \"She is very fit...\"</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>04.32am</strong> Britain are in equal fourth, surpassing all expectations at the half way stage.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>04.34am:</strong> But they've fallen away now. The Netherlands take gold. Silver to the US. Bronze to Australia. Great Britain take a second off the domestic record but even that's not enough to catch the four Dutch ladies cavorting in victory at the end of the pool.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>04.42am: Team GB Archery</strong> - a quarter-final against Japan for the women's team of Naomi Folkard, Charlotte Burgess and five-time Olympian Alison Williamson. Britain lead by two.</p> <p>''The hooter for the timing on the archery is clearly the horn off a 1993 Volkswagen Jetta. It's unmistakeable. I'm surprised Eddie Butler didn't pick up on it,'' says Gareth Bennett.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>04.44am:</strong> An email from far, far away! ''Good Morning you poor soul,'' writes Matt, who I warm to immediately since <em>no one else understands me</em>. ''I'm in Seoul spending a Sunday afternoon watching the Korean Olympic coverage on TV. I can't understand the commentary but it appears Park Tae hwan has won 14 gold medals today; either that or they are showing his 400m race on a constant loop. The commentary was hilarious of the final 25 metres: another 50 and I think the commentator would have soiled himself. Oh, and Korean coverage is making me long for the BBC's.''</p> <p>The BBC coverage has been ... Barry Davies-less so far. And that's not a good thing.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>05.02: Team GB</strong> - It's very close in this one. All level with one end to go. Eddie Butler says the word ''sultry'' for the 9th time - it's hot out east, he seems to be stressing - and there goes the car horn again.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>05.10am:</strong> Team GB make the semi finals of the women's archery, seeing off Japan 201 to 188. A 9, 10, 10 in their last set ended the sultry Japanese resistance. They will now face China at 9am-ish BST.</p> <p>Tired of reading my London-based witterings? Read Andy Bull's Beijing-based profundities. He lays down the gauntlet to Michael Phelps <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/10/phelps_might_truly_be_touched.html\">here</a>.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>05.13am:</strong> What are Asians making of this Chinese Olympics? ''I don't think the Koreans see any problem with China hosting the Olympics or its human rights record or the rampant nationalism on display: the Korean personality is quite similar. I'm convinced they are more concerned with winning more medals than Japan and protesting about USA beef imports,'' says our Korea correspondent, Matt.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>05.22am:</strong> Give just a hint of self-loathing, and the supportive emails positively roll in. ''Don't despair,'' counsels Christian Wolff. ''I'm relying on Guardian updates here in Bangalore, since Indian state TV Doordarshan seems determined to ruin my Olympics experience - despite possessing exclusive national broadcast rights, most of their coverage consists of two elderly gentlemen sitting in a studio re-capping the success of one female badminton player and the failures of the archery team, while completely ignoring any of the LIVE events going on in Beijing...''</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>05.25am:</strong> The gymnastics are in full swing. Tumbles, tinny classical music, impossibly young Chinese girls looking terrified of the consequences of failure... Speaking of the BBC coverage, Victoria Bingham writes: ''Is is just me or do Matt Baker's excitable Geordie mutterings seem wildly out of sync with the grace of the gymnastics. Shouldn't they have him on canoeing or something. He'll be well used to that. That's all they do on Blue Peter, isn't it?''</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>05.30am: Gold for China in the women's 10m air pistol final</strong>. Guo Wenjun takes gold. Russia's Natalia Paderina wins silver with bronze going to Georgia's Nino Salukvadze.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>05.34am: </strong> Andy Bull gets very excited by women's fencing. Read his theatre review <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/10/olympics_zagunis_the_golden_gi.html\">here</a>.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>05.39am:</strong> A missive from Down Under. ''The Aussie commentators seem a bit disappointed that they didn't win three golds in the pool this morning,'' writes Paul Meek in Brisbane, who immediately emphasises that he's a Kiwi. ''Yesterday was the first time they hadn't won a medal on the first day since 1996 - oh, the humanity! And not sure whether Stephanie Rice has been an underwear model, but she did do a bit of modelling for the local FHM earlier in the year.''</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>05.45am:</strong> ''Despite actually being in an Olympic city (Hong Kong) I am also bizarrely reliant on your commentary to keep me up-to-date,'' writes the magnificently monikered Kester Bramley. ''All the action is on free, terrestrial TV but since my building has no aerial I have what Pink Floyd called \"45 channels of shit on the TV to choose from (choose from)\" but no Olympics. I could go out and watch the equestrian events, I suppose - but trottage, or whatever it is called, on a Sunday? Would rather sit by my screen hoping for a blitz of Gary Naylor insights thanks.''</p> <p>Oh, Naylor, Naylor, wherefore art thou, Naylor? It's dawn in London. We expect him soon.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>05.50:</strong> Fencing and judo are continuing apace. To the Beijing University of Technology for the women's badminton (I almost felt like an anchorman just then), where defending champion Zhang Ning of China has recovered from a shaky start to beat Thailand's Salakjit Ponsana in three sets, 21-23, 21-17, 21-7.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>06.00am: Olympic spirit shames world leaders into stopping all wars for good</strong> - Georgia's Nino Salukvadze took bronze in the 10m air pistol final. After putting down her pistol on her final shot, she wiped tears from her eyes and embraced her Russian opponent, Natalia Paderina. \"I've been really nervous,\" she said afterwards. \"Since yesterday I thought we would leave the Games. The Russian political leaders, our political leaders and other state political leaders should sit and talk about this.\"</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>06.05am:</strong> We've made it past 6am and the reward on the BBC is ... well, i'll let Conor O'Kane explain: ''You sit up all night with Rishi Persad, and what's your reward? Adrian bloody Chiles. That's what the license fee is being used on, flying him to Beijing? As if that's not bad enough, he's forgotten the delightful Christine Bleakley from the One show, so we get Hazel Irvine and her massive teeth.''</p> <p>I think it might be bedtime, Conor.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>06.13am:</strong> By all accounts the tennis has finally got underway. It's been a long rain delay, meaning the Murrays won't be playing their first doubles match for a while yet.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>06.16am: Team GB</strong> In the sailing, the 49er races have started. Steve Morrison and Ben Rhodes have three 30 minute races today. They're currently fourth in the opener. Also in Qingdao, Britain's Yngling crew of Sarah Ayton, Sarah Webb and Pippa Wilson are leading from the front.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>06.29am: </strong> Germany beat Angola 95-66 in the men's basketball.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong><strong>06.30am:</strong> Team GB Gymnastics</strong>. Qualification phase - Subdivision 2: GB, Italy, Japan and the US. </p> <p>The shiny-blue-leotarded Great Britain team is warming up for the vault. Remember that Beth Tweddle's hip injury means she will only compete on the asymmetric bars and the floor disciplines.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>06.35am:</strong> Conor O'Kane has had a coffee and comes back for more. He obviously pays attention to his sailing, too. ''One of the 49er class boys in the sailing, Stevie Morrison, hopes his boat's name 'Little Miss Pipe Dream' will prove to be apt. The Dictionary says: 'A pipe dream is a fantastic hope or plan that is generally regarded as being nearly impossible to achieve.' Little Miss Easy Prospect might have been better...''</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>06.40am: Team GB </strong> A good start on the vault for 16-year-old Becky Downie. Her 15.050 is so good it quite literally makes her American opponent cry. </p> <p>In other gymnastics news, the Americans' leotards are awful: garish red, an ugly great big star, the balance is all wrong. The Italians have gone for delightfully classic white with sparkly bits.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>06.52: </strong> Heads up: Former Bluebells bassist Lawrence Donegan will be blogging live from the China v US basketball game at 2pm BST.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>07.00am: Team GB Cycling</strong> - The women's road race is coming up shortly. Nicola Cooke, Emma Pooley and Sharon Laws will take 3 and a half hours to complete the 72km route.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong><strong>07.03am:</strong> Team GB</strong> Ben Rhodes and Stevie Morrison made a solid start in their first 49er class race, finishing fourth in Qingdao.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>07.06am: There's no accounting for taste.</strong> Sean Dickinson emails from Shanghai to dispute my gymnastics analysis: ''Just wanted to wake you up if you weren't already asleep which, judging by your presumably worsening eyesight and taste, is evidenced by your lack of appreciation for yellow stars on skimpy red leotards.''</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>07.11am: Team GB Cycling</strong> The women's road race is go!</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>07.14am: Gymnastics</strong> Rebecca Wing opens on the beam for GB. I'm told it was good. </p> <p>Sean Dickinson is pining for the green fields of Hollyoaks: ''Go Tweddle! She's from my hometown of Chester, and what she did looked impressive to me.''</p> <p>Beth Tweddle's score of 15.65 puts her fourth in the bars - the top eight go through. She hit the bar with one of her feet during her routine, costing her points.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>07.17am: Team GB Yngling</strong> <strong>Sarah Ayton, Sarah Webb and Pippa Wilson are first in the overall standings</strong> after placing fourth in their third race. Holland and Finland follow close behind.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>07.23am:</strong> In the men's Judo (66kg), a showdown between a Russian and a Georgian has been narrowly averted. Miklos Ungvari of Hungary beat the Georgian Zaza Kedelashvili to set up a quarter-final with Russia's Alim Gadanov. The two countries will just have to settle their differences on the battlefield.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>07.30am: Road race</strong> 110.6km to go. The riders are all bunching together. No one's yet made the break. Speaking of breaks, I'm off in 30 minutes. Must...keep...typing....But never fear: Alan Gardner will see you through to the end with a laughably easy three-hour shift.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong><strong>07.34am:</strong> Team GB</strong> News of Ben Ainslie in today's Finn event. He's finished fourth place in race three, which puts him second overall.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>07.38am: Team GB Gymnastics </strong> Sixteen-year-old Hannah Whelan does a jig or two in her floor routine. Folkish violins accompany her smiles and wiggles. Then she attempts some real gymnastics. Oh dear. A stumble. Then a pike. Not bad.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong><strong>07.46am:</strong> Team GB Sailing</strong> Ben Rhodes and Stevie Morrison finish third in the second 49er race. That puts them second overall. One more race to come today.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>07.55am: Team GB Gymnastics</strong> Beth Tweddle's floor routine begins. She needs it to go well. </p> <p>It's decent - 14.950 - but she is unlikely to make the final. Overall, Britain lie fifth after four rotations. Team qualification in the top eight will be struggle. Becky Downie is hovering close to individual qualification but there a lot of women to come.</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>08.13am:</strong> Hello all. Taimour has headed off to stare blankly into space somewhere, and I'll be your Olympic guide for the next few hours. News on Beth Tweddle, and the GB women road racers asap...</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>8.20am: Team GB rowing</strong> Wellity, well, we have a real medal hope to discuss, ladies and gentleman. Zac Purchase and Mark Hunter are going in the mens lightweight double sculls, and they've apparently set their hearts on gold. The pair have started smoothly and are holding a comfortable advantage, with two to go through.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>8.27am: Team GB rowing</strong> Purchase and Hunter are safely through into the semi-final, winning by a length and only 3.7sec outside the world record. Good start for the boat boys.</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>8.35am: China have picked up another gold</strong>, in the women's synchronised 3m springboard. Guo Jingjing and Wu Minxia, the reigning world and Olympic champions have wrapped things up again. Russia took silver, with Germany collecting bronze.</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>8.45am: We got mail.</strong> And yes, it's the first of the day from Gary Naylor. \"I note from your 7.00am update,\" notes Naylor, \"that 'Nicola Cooke, Emma Pooley and Sharon Laws will take 3 and a half hours to complete the 72km route.' Unless all the competitors are stopping for a pleasant Sunday afternoon picnic with a glass or two of Pimms, I suspect that an average speed of 20km per hour won't secure a medal.\" Well, you know how the British like to do things Gary.</p> <p>In fact, after some <a href=\"http://en.beijing2008.cn/news/sports/headlines/cyclingroad/n214522963.shtml\">rummaging</a>, I can scribble in my official correction highlighter that the women will not be cycling a mere 72km... it'll be more like double that, once they've got up into the mountains (where it's pouring, apparently), and done a wee jaunt along the Great Wall. They're not there yet, though.</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>8.54am: Team GB</strong> Cooke, Pooley and Laws are safely ensconced in the peloton... although they may as well be in the pool, the amount of rain that's washing around their wheels as they head out of Beijing.</p> <p>Meanwhile, <strong>Billy Joe Saunders</strong> has given his opponent, Turkey's Adem Kilicci, an absolute tonking in the welterweight class. He won 14-3, and will fight again next Sunday.</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>8.59am: News from Beijing.</strong> Apparently, such is their hatred for the west*, the Chinese equivalents of Adrian Chiles and Hazel Irvine have started mocking our athletes' weight. \"Watching here in Beijing on TV, my flatmate just informed me that the Chinese commentators amusingly said the British women couldn't succeed in diving because they were too fat,\" emails Nicky Goh. \"To qualify it slightly, they did go on to say that with their weight, it was extremely unlikely they could achieve the necessary body strength to allow for the turning power necessary.\" Oh, that's all right then.</p> <p>*Of course, we know they don't hate us really</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>9.04am: Team GB archery</strong> Eddie Butler's mellifluous tones are telling me about the women archers, who are up against the Chinese. Win, and they're guaranteed a medal; lose, and they'll have to duke it out for bronze. Currently, it's in the balance.</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>9.08am: Team GB rowing</strong> Some more success in the mens lightweight four, where Chambers, Clarke, Lindsay-Fynn and Mattick are through in their heat, coming home behind China.</p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>9.15am: Team GB archery</strong> At the halfway stage, the British girls trail by just two points, but they need to keep hitting the bullseye to make up ground on their opponents. Interestingly, the announcer in the archery arena appears to be American.</p> <p>Oh, and on that subject, it's the clash of civilisations, sorry, China v USA in the basketball later today, and Lawrence Donegan will be <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/10/china_v_usa_usa_usa_live.html\">blogging about it LIVE</a>. It doesn't start till 3pm, though, so stick with me until then.</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>9.23am: Team GB archery</strong> China will take on the winners of Korea v France for the women's team gold medal. The Brits can still take bronze though, and it's no shame losing to the Chinese, who've won every gold in female arrers since the 1984 Olympics.</p> <p>In the <strong>cycling, the women's team are well positioned out in a very wet road race.</strong> Pooley is right up at the front, and all three managed to avoid a nasty crash that happened a short while ago.</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>9.32am: Team GB</strong> Ben Ainslie is second in the overall standings in the Finn, having won the fourth race ahead of Zach Railey of the USA. Railey currently heads the field, with a score of 11, but Ainslie is just five points behind on 16 (the lower the better).</p> <p>In the rowing, it's the women's heavyweight quadruple sculls, where China are out in front, with one spot in the final up for grabs. In fact, they're <em>miles</em> out in front...</p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p><strong>9.35am: Team GB rowing</strong> Britain's women's heavyweight four, who are the reigning world champions, will go next against the Germans, with both expected to be China's main oppo in next Sunday's final.</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>9.39am: Correction corner.</strong> My hideous ignorance of the archery has been revealed. \"I think you'll find it is the South Koreans, not the Chinese, who have won all those women's archery gold medals,\" says Philip Reynolds, all the way from Wellington, NZ. \"And it's not called the bullseye; it's called the gold or (in Olympic archery) the ten.\" I was employing the vernacular, Phil.</p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>9.43am: Team GB rowing</strong> The women's quadruple scullers are moving well out on the water, putting some deep blue between them and the German team.</p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p><strong>9.45am:</strong> GB being reeled in by Germany, can Grainger and her crew hold on...? Less than 500m to go.</p> <!-- Block 82 --> <p><strong>9.48am: Team GB rowing</strong> There was enough left in the tank and the ladies will take their place in the final. They'll be up, as ever, against the Chinese. You can get some background on Katherine Grainger and the GB quad <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/08/olympicsrowing.britisholympicteam\">here</a>. Sir Steve (Redgrave) reckons they did pretty well out there.</p> <!-- Block 83 --> <p><strong>9.52am: Cycling</strong> There's a Russian out in front in the road race, and she's putting some pressure on the field. The <strong>British trio are still well in contention for a medal</strong>, though. They've been cycling for nearly three hours now.</p> <!-- Block 84 --> <p><strong>9.55am: Team GB rowing</strong> In the lightweight men's quadruple sculls the chaps have pulled hard and qualified in second. I imagine they'll all be off for an erg now, to celebrate.</p> <!-- Block 85 --> <p><strong>10.00am: Team GB cycling</strong> Emma Pooley has made a break on the climb, and she's in a group tailing the Russian, Boyarskaya. Cooke is back in fourth with a strong finish up her sleeve. Hopefully.</p> <!-- Block 86 --> <p><strong>10.05am:</strong> It seems the media centre in Beijing is falling apart. At least the BBC's studio is. A violent squall has halted the women's archery bronze play-off - where we could be looking at a <strong>first medal for Team GB</strong> - and the women's cycling road race is similarly pluvial. But the real drama, as I say, is at BBC hq, where someone has joined Hazel Irvine in the studio holding a bucket. They're crouched discretely behind the sofa... but I can definitely see them holding the bucket.</p> <!-- Block 87 --> <p><strong>10.12am:</strong> Nigeria are playing Japan in the football. I'm backing the Super Eagles there. Hopefully we're going to get a GB medal before long, with real prospects in the cycling and the archery. I'd be reet chuffed to break such news, I can tell you.</p> <p>A Chinese rider has slid into the storm drain in the women's road race. Plenty of names still in the mix... <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/09/longo_joins_elite_group_of_sev.html\">Jeannie Longo-Ciprelli, the oldest lady in the field</a> has just had a go at the front!</p> <!-- Block 88 --> <p><strong>10.19am:</strong> The cyclists have just reached the highest point along the Badaling Great Wall, and with twelve kilometres to go Tatiana Guderzo of Italy is leading.</p> <!-- Block 89 --> <p><strong>10.27am: Medal news.</strong> While we wait for Britain to get on the medal table, Thailand have snapped up their first gold. The improbably named Prapawadee Jaroenrattanatarakoon (or Charoenrattanatharakul if you want to go with the Guardian's Olympic guide) has bossed the field in women's 53kg weightlifting. Apparently she used to be known as Junpim Kantatian, which is altogether less of a mouthfull. Yun Jin-hee of South Korea took silver and Anastassia Novikava of Belarus bronze.</p> <p>Elsewhere, the rowing has been suspended for the day due to the weather.</p> <!-- Block 90 --> <p><strong>10.31am:</strong> 1km to go in the women's road race. Nicole Cooke, fifth in Athens, appears to have lost contact... but apparently she's recovered.</p> <!-- Block 91 --> <p><strong>10.33am: Team GB</strong> Cooke leading with 100m to go.</p> <!-- Block 92 --> <p><strong>10.34am: Team GB GOLD!</strong> Nicole Cooke has claimed the first British medal of Beijing 2008. Some confusion on the broadcast for a moment there, with the Italian Guderzo's name flashing up on screen as the winner... But Cooke is jubilant!</p> <!-- Block 93 --> <p><strong>10.38am:</strong> Cooke, swathed in one of those plastic ponchos you get at festivals, is enjoying this. Several vigorous fist pumps, and the Welshwoman couldn't care a jot about the rain now.</p> <!-- Block 94 --> <p><strong>10.42am:</strong> A big hand should go to Emma Pooley, who finished 23rd, for her earlier efforts in chasing down the leader on the climb. Cooke really seemed to benefit from her team-mates' support, something she lacked four years ago. That's the 200th gold medal at Olympic Games for Great Britain.</p> <!-- Block 95 --> <p><strong>10.45am: Team GB archery</strong> The BBC's rainfall woes in the studio appeared to have been dealt with... and we're off to the Bronze medal match in the women's team archery.</p> <!-- Block 96 --> <p><strong>10.49am:</strong> The clouds are lowering above the archers, as Britain complete their first end (of four) with a score of 48. The French are just behind on 46.</p> <!-- Block 97 --> <p><strong>10.52am:</strong> The American guy on the mic is doing a neat job, as the second end gets under way. He might well be Chinese, of course, with a nifty Yankee drawl, but hey...</p> <!-- Block 98 --> <p><strong>10.55am:</strong> And after the second end, it's all square, 97 each.</p> <!-- Block 99 --> <p><strong>10.56am:</strong> Hold on... one of the French arrows has been remarked, and they're ahead.</p> <!-- Block 100 --> <p><strong>11.01am:</strong> Good start to the third end, with a full ten for GB, but it's still tight as we head towards 18 completed arrows. Six more will decide where this bronze is going. GB: 149 plays France: 150.</p> <!-- Block 101 --> <p><strong>11.03am:</strong> \"Isn't archery just darts for posh people?\" wondered Gary Naylor some time ago. Three arrows left and France look like they're going to sneak it... three points the advantage.</p> <!-- Block 102 --> <p><strong>11.06am:</strong> Nine, 10, eight for GB. France need 25 points to win from three...</p> <!-- Block 103 --> <p><strong>11.08am: France win the bronze medal.</strong> Gah! No success in the women's team archery, then. Two points the margin of victory, and the GB arrer-wielders obviously weren't posh enough. \"No - darts for posh people is d'arts,\" counters Philip Reynolds. Touch\u00e9, Naylor?</p> <!-- Block 104 --> <p><strong>11.12am: Medal ceremony.</strong> Nicole Cooke \"conquered the course and tamed the opposition\", apparently. In fact, she beat them in a bike race. And she's being awarded a gold for her troubles now. Sing with me: \"God save our gracious Queen...\"</p> <!-- Block 105 --> <p><strong>11.18am:</strong> Nigeria have knocked one in against the Japanese to take a 1-0 lead in the football. Sharp side-foot finish in the box by Obinna Nsofor. And Everton's Victor Anichebe has taken the field.</p> <!-- Block 106 --> <p><strong>11.22am: The Cooke report.</strong> So, we've picked up our first necklace of the Games, and it's a shiny gold one to boot. Read about Nicole Cooke's success in the women's road race <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/10/olympics.cyclingroadrace\">here</a>.</p> <!-- Block 107 --> <p><strong>11.31am:</strong> The indomitable Koreans have opened up a lead against the Chinese in the women's team archery final. Meanwhile, the Croatian water polo team reckon the moustaches they have grown for the Olympics will help them go all the way. \"It's for good luck, but we can't talk about it, it's a secret, if I tell you, it will ruin it,\" Igor Hinic told Reuters, ruining his precious secret in one flap of the tongue.</p> <p>Maybe they're right, though. It worked for Mark Spitz, after all. In fact, it's Spitz Day here at Rebranded Website, and we're all sporting handle bars.</p> <!-- Block 108 --> <p><strong>11.35am: South Korea win gold in the women's team archery</strong>, setting a new world record in the process. China will have to settle for silver.</p> <!-- Block 109 --> <p><strong>11.42am:</strong> Dave Godman, meanwhile, has trawled his way right down to the 5.22am entry to concur with Christian Wolff's struggles to comprehend Indian television's coverage of the Games.</p> <p>\"You only watch the Olympics on the state channel here [India] if you have a finely tuned appreciation of surreal farce,\" says Dave, avoiding the opportunity to stick a knee in the ribs of the BBC's (excellent) coverage. \"Eight years ago I watched in a hotel room. Random live visual feeds were appearing on the screen, with no sound commentary. It was left to the two talking heads in the studio to figure out what was going on. At one point a handball game manifested, but neither of the commentators had ever seen a handball game before.\" Them and me both, to be honest.</p> <!-- Block 110 --> <p><strong>11.47am:</strong> Nigeria are 2-1 ahead now. No Joseph Yobo there, of course, because the Nigerian FA forgot to include him in their squad. Much to the delight of Everton fans, presumably.</p> <!-- Block 111 --> <p><strong>11.53am:</strong> Turns out Victor Anichebe scored Nigeria's second, ultimately the winner. Will England regret not calling him up when they still could? It's not like the national set-up is exactly overflowing with confident strikers...</p> <!-- Block 112 --> <p><strong>11.59am: Team GB swimming</strong> Gemma Spofforth and Elizabeth Simmonds have made the semi-finals of the women's 100m backstroke, after finishing 3rd and 4th in their heats respectively.</p> <!-- Block 113 --> <p><strong>12.05pm: Cricket corner.</strong> Steve Harmison has knocked over a couple of wickets in the Test. You can follow the action with Carrie Dunn <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/10/englandsouthafrica.overbyover\">here</a>.</p> <p>Lots of stroking going on at the Water Cube, meanwhile.</p> <!-- Block 114 --> <p><strong>12.10pm: Medal news.</strong> China have another gold, this time <strong>in the women's judo 52kg weight category.</strong> Xian Dongmei beat An Kum Ae of North Korea to retain the title she won in Athens. The crowd quite enjoyed that.</p> <!-- Block 115 --> <p><strong>12.19pm: Team GB swimming</strong> Robbie Renwick from Aberdeen is racing in the men's 200m freestyle. He appears to be in second...</p> <!-- Block 116 --> <p><strong>12.21pm:</strong> Renwick came home in third, and is in with a shout of making the semis. The Baltimore Bullet (surely a more nautical nickname would work better?) Michael Phelps has just flopped into the pool for a lazy 200m of his own. Britain's Ross Davenport is also racing.</p> <!-- Block 117 --> <p><strong>12.27pm:</strong> Phelps, sans tache, finishes in second, but is surely saving himself for the crunch. Davenport was sixth.</p> <p>Turns out no one else on the desk has gone with the spirit of Mark Spitz Day, and I'm the only one who turned up with a stylish facial accoutrement. Bah.</p> <!-- Block 118 --> <p><strong>12.35pm: Medal news. Japan have taken gold in the men's 66kg judo</strong>, Masato Uchishiba triumphing against Benjamin Darbelet of France.</p> <p><strong>Team GB swimming</strong> Despite his third place, Robbie Renwick's slower heat has meant he will not be in the semis, his time just a hundredth of a second short. Davenport, who was in Phelps' heat, is through though.</p> <!-- Block 119 --> <p><strong>12.38pm: Team GB badminton</strong> Tracey Hallam is thwacking a shuttlecock back and forth against Kristina Ludikova of the Czech Republic in the women's singles round of 32.</p> <!-- Block 120 --> <p><strong>12.42pm: Team GB swimming</strong> Kate Haywood and Kirsty Balfour are off in the women's 100m breaststroke...</p> <!-- Block 121 --> <p><strong>12.44pm:</strong> Haywood finished third, Balfour fourth, and they're both potential semi-finalists.</p> <!-- Block 122 --> <p><strong>12.47pm:</strong> They're both through, with the 11th and 14th best times respectively. The Australian Leisel Jones broke the Olympic record in that final heat, so she's the fish to catch. Haywood and Balfour will need to get to the final before I'm going to be lured into medal talk, though.</p> <!-- Block 123 --> <p><strong>12.55pm:</strong> In the Olympic football, we've got Netherlands versus the US, and Jacqui Oatley on the mic. Real Madrid's Roysten Drenthe hammers a left foot volley over the bar for the Dutch, as Aston Villa newbie Brad Guzan practises semaphore.</p> <p>Earlier, Ronaldinho scored twice in Brazil's 5-0 larruping of New Zealand. Argentina nicked it 1-0 against Australia, while Cameroon beat Honduras 1-0.</p> <!-- Block 124 --> <p><strong>1.02pm: Team GB swimming</strong> Liam Tancock, the British hope in the 100m backstroke comes home third in his heat after torpedoing off the platform. He'll be back in the semis later.</p> <!-- Block 125 --> <p><strong>1.06pm:</strong> Tancock goes out quick, that's what he does. He's pleased, as is Gregor Tait who's also in the semi-finals.</p> <p>And you'll be smiling when you've cast your mince pies over <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/gallery/2008/aug/10/olympics2008?picture=336400711\">these photos from today</a>.</p> <!-- Block 126 --> <p><strong>1.10pm: GOAL! USA 0-1 Holland</strong> Ryan Babel finishes from close range after some confusion in the box. Liverpool's wingman gets his first goal of the tournament.</p> <!-- Block 127 --> <p><strong>1.14pm: Team GB boxing</strong> Bradley Saunders has stopped his Ghanaian opponent Samuel Kotey Neequaye in the first round of their light welterweight match-up. Biff boff.</p> <!-- Block 128 --> <p><strong>1.18pm:</strong> Just getting a replay of that Saunders fight, and he really crunched the little fella with a body shot. Layed him flatter than a new patio.</p> <!-- Block 129 --> <p><strong>1.31pm:</strong> The geriatric form of Brian McBride is trundling around the more deserted parts of the pictch, ie. the Dutch half. How old is he? Answers in an email.</p> <p>Meanwhile, shattering news for all male Olympic-watchers: <strong> Anna Ivanovic has PULLED OUT</strong>. \"This is one of the worst moments of my career,\" she said. And I can only echo that statement.</p> <!-- Block 130 --> <p><strong>1.34pm:</strong> Half time score update:</p> <p>Serbia 1-2 Ivory Coast<br>USA 0-1 Netherlands<br>Belgium 1-0 China<br>Italy 2-0 South Korea</p> <!-- Block 131 --> <p><strong>1.38pm: Team GB swimming</strong> In the women's 400m freestyle, Jo Jackson has just finished second to Katie Hoff, the US bellwether in the pool, in a time that is just under a tenth of a second outside Hoff's <strong>new Olympic record.</strong></p> <p>Rebecca Adlington, who is being tipped as a British gold medal prospect, goes in the next heat.</p> <!-- Block 132 --> <p><strong>1.44pm:</strong> Adlington pushes the current world record holder Federica Pellegrini all the way in their heat, the Brit finishing second with the second-quickest time overall.</p> <p>Pellegrini also <strong>broke the Olympic record just set by Hoff</strong>, as it goes.</p> <!-- Block 133 --> <p><strong>1.50pm: Team GB badminton</strong> Gail Emms and Donna Kellogg are playing their Chinese opposition in the women's doubles. Earlier, Tracey Hallam progressed in her singles match, with a 21-18, 21-13 victory.</p> <!-- Block 134 --> <p><strong>1.53pm:</strong> The US men's 4x100m freestyle relay team has just set a new record over in the Water Cube. And Michael Phelps wasn't even near the pool. Apparently they're the US B-team. It's those Speedos, I tell you, should be banned...</p> <p>Great Britain are about to go in the second heat.</p> <!-- Block 135 --> <p><strong>1.58pm: Team GB swimming</strong> The British lads have gunned their way through that heat, finishing in fourth and sealing a spot in the final. They <strong>smashed the British record by five seconds</strong>, in the process.</p> <!-- Block 136 --> <p><strong>2.01pm: China have hoovered up another gold, this time in the men's 56kg weightlifting.</strong> Long Quinquan won from Anh Tuang Hoang of Vietnam and Indonesia's Eko Yuli Irawan.</p> <!-- Block 137 --> <p><strong>2.06pm: GOAL! USA 1-1 Netherlands</strong> Sacha Kljestan hammers a strike through the Dutch stopper after Freddy Adu's clever reverse pass. Yes, that Freddy Adu.</p> <!-- Block 138 --> <p><strong>2.12pm: Team GB hockey</strong> The girls from Blighty are taking on the Germans as I type, with the scores currently tied nil all. Someone has just been shown a green card - which means little to me, but is \"akin to a professional foul\" apparently. The best news though is that the legendary Barry Davies is providing the verbal annotation.</p> <!-- Block 139 --> <p><strong>2.17pm: GOAL! USA 2-1 Netherlands</strong> Jozy Altidore, newly-signed by Villarreal, has put the septics in front. Meanwhile, according to Sean Dickinson in Shanghai, someone in the China-Belgium game has been \"sent off for what appeared to be hitting someone [else] off the ball when the ref's head was turned\". If that's clear.</p> <!-- Block 140 --> <p><strong>2.25pm: Team GB hockey - GOAL! Germany 1-0 Great Britain</strong> \"Beautifully done,\" exclaims Barry Davies, as the GB ladies turn their opponents inside then out. Moments later Germany take the lead from a penalty corner.</p> <!-- Block 141 --> <p><strong>2.30pm: GOAL! Germany 1-1 Great Britain</strong> Back in the game. A penalty corner at the other end and the ball squirts into the goal off the wet surface.</p> <!-- Block 142 --> <p><strong>2.33pm: GOAL! Germany 2-1 Great Britain</strong> Ach, as soon as they're level there's a loss of concentration at the back by Britain and the red-clad Germans have the lead again.</p> <!-- Block 143 --> <p><strong>2.35pm: Olympic football - GOAL! USA 2-2 Netherlands</strong> The 34-year-old Gerald Sibon, who once played for Sheffield Wednesday, drills a free-kick under the wall and past Brad Guzan. That will certainly change the state of Group B - although I'm not entirely certain in what way.</p> <!-- Block 144 --> <p><strong>2.46pm:</strong> Final scores in the football for you:</p> <p>Serbia 2-4 Ivory Coast<br>USA 2-2 Netherlands<br>Belgium 2-0 China<br>Italy 3-0 South Korea</p> <p>It appears the hosts ended up with just nine men on the pitch in their loss to Belgium. Seems like the <a href=\"http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200407/16/eng20040716_149849.html\">inventors of football</a> are as adept at rolling over as we are.</p> <!-- Block 145 --> <p><strong>2.50pm: Team GB badminton</strong> After that flurry of GOALs I forgot to inform you that Emms and Kellogg were defeated in their first round doubles match against China's Zhang Jiewen and Wei Yili, losing 21-19 21-13.</p> <p>Still 2-1 to Germany in the hockey.</p> <!-- Block 146 --> <p><strong>2.55pm: Pat on the back dept.</strong> As this mbm prepares to roll up its bumper Olympic guide and head into the Beijing sunset, David Lloyd's email lands:</p> <p>\"I've been living in north China for around 18 months now, generally having a great time in an amazing country. So I've obviously been looking forward to these Olympics for a long time as you might imagine. To date however it's not been the best of starts. I was up at 5.30am to witness the torch relay but couldn't get within 30 metres of the road barrier, then the typhoon in South China kept me and my mate stranded just long enough to miss the football match in Tinajin last Wednesday night, for which I had tickets. Now to cap it all, I find that of the endless CCTV channels showing Olympic coverage, including the specially set up one, none have any spoken or written English language coverage. Considering all the effort the Chinese have put into these games, that's a big oversight if you ask me, especially when considering the tens of thousands of English speakers who've travelled here specially, not to mention the good ol' expat community.\"</p> <p>Glad to have been of service, David. We'll be here all fortnight.</p> <!-- Block 147 --> <p><strong>3.01pm: Team GB hockey - GOAL! Germany 3-1 Great Britain</strong> Looks like a wrap there then.</p> <p>With day two drawing to a close, I shall bid you all goodbye. If you fancy following the almighty ding-dong that's bound to ensue between China and the US in the basketball, slam-dunk you way across <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/10/china_v_usa_usa_usa_live.html\">to Lawrence Donegan's blog</a> now. And if diving and histrionics are more your thing, why not <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/aug/10/portsmouth.manchesterunited\">join Paul Doyle for the FA Community Shield</a>. That's it from me, cheerio.</p>"
