  "<p>Where does a junkie's time go? Mostly in 15-minute increments, like a bug-eyed Tarzan, swinging from hit to hit. For months on end in 1988, I sat inside a house in north Minneapolis, doing coke and listening to Tracy Chapman's 'Fast Car' and finding my own pathetic resonance in the lyrics. 'Any place is better,' she sang. 'Starting from zero, got nothing to lose.' <br>After shooting or smoking a large dose, there would be the tweaking and a vigil at the front window, pulling up the corner of the blinds to look for the squads I was always convinced were on their way. All day. All night. A frantic kind of boring. End-stage addiction is mostly about waiting for the police, or someone, to come and bury you in your shame.</p> <p>After a while I noticed the blinds on the upper duplex diagonal from the house were doing the same thing. The light would leak through a corner and disappear. I began to think of the rise and fall of their blinds and mine as a kind of Morse code, sent back and forth across the street in winking increments that said the same thing over and over.</p> <p>W-e a-r-e g-e-t-t-i-n-g h-i-g-h t-o-o.</p> <p>They rarely came out, and neither did I, so we never discussed our shared hobby. </p> <p>I was lonely, but not alone. The house belonged to Anna, my girlfriend and dope dealer, who had two kids of her own and newborn twins by me. One night, Anna was out somewhere, and I was there with the kids. I had a new pipe, clean screens, a fresh blowtorch and the kids were asleep. It was just me and Barley, a Corgi mix I'd had since college. When I was alone and tweaking with Barley, I'd ask her random questions. Barley didn't talk back per se, but I heard answers staring into her large brown eyes.</p> <p>Am I a lunatic? Yes. When am I going to cut this stuff out? Apparently never. Does God see me right now? Yes. God sees everything, including the blind. </p> <p>Trapped in drug-induced paranoia, I began to think of the police as God's emissaries, arriving not to seek vengeance but a ceasefire, a truce that would put me up against a wall of well-deserved consequences, and the non-combatants, the children, out of harm's way.</p> <p>On this night \u2013 it was near the end \u2013 every hit sent out an alarm along my vibrating synapses. If the cops were coming, I should be sitting out in front of the house. That way I could tell them that yes, there were drugs and paraphernalia in the house, but no guns. And there were four blameless children. They could put the bracelets on me and, head bowed, I'd solemnly lead them to the drugs, to the needles, to the pipes, to what was left of the money. And then some sweet-faced matrons would magically appear and scoop up those babies and take them to that safe, happy place. I had it all planned out.</p> <p>I took another hit, and Barley and I walked out and sat on the steps. My eyes, my heart, the veins in my forehead, pulsed against the stillness of the night. And then they came. Six unmarked cars riding in formation with lights off, no cherries, just like I pictured. It's on.</p> <p>A mix of uniforms and plainclothes got out, and in the weak light of the street, I could see long guns held at 45-degree angles. I was oddly proud that I was on the steps, that I now stood between my children and the dark fruits of the life I had chosen. I had made the right move after endless wrong ones. And then they turned and went to the house across the street.</p> <p>Much yelling. 'Facedown! Hug the carpet! No sudden movements!' A guy dropped out of the second-floor window wearing only gym shorts, but they were waiting. More yelling and then quiet. I went back inside the house and watched the rest of it play out through the corner of the blind. Their work done, the cops loaded several cuffed people into a van. I let go of the blind and got back down to business. It wasn't my turn.</p> <p>Twenty years later, now sober and back for a look at my past, I sat outside that house on Oliver Avenue on a hot summer day in a rental car, staring long and hard to make sense of what had and had not happened there. The neighbourhood had turned over from white to black, but it was pretty much the same. Nice lawns, lots of kids, no evidence of the mayhem that had gone on inside. Sitting there in a suit with a nice job in a city far away and those twins on their way to college, I almost would have thought I'd made it up. But I don't think I did. While I sat there giving my past the once over, someone lifted up the corner of the blind in the living-room window. It was time to go.</p> <p>On the face of it, I am no more qualified to take my own inventory than the addict with the fetid dreads who spare-changes people on the subway while singing 'Stand by Me'. Ask him how he ended up sweating people for quarters, and he may have an answer, but he doesn't really know and probably couldn't bear it if he did.</p> <p>To be an addict is to be something of a cognitive acrobat. You spread versions of yourself around, giving each person the truth he or she needs \u2013 you need, actually \u2013 to keep them at a remove. Let's stipulate that I do not have a good memory, having recklessly saut\u00e9ed my brain in fistfuls of pharmaceutical spices. Beyond impairment, there may be no more unreliable narrator than an addict. Recovered or not, I am someone who used my mouth to constantly create one more opportunity to get high. </p> <p>Here is what I deserved: hepatitis C, federal prison time, HIV, a cold park bench, an early, addled death.</p> <p>Here is what I got: the smart, pretty wife, the three lovely children, the job that impresses.</p> <p>Here is what I remember about how That Guy became This Guy: not much. But my version of events is worth knowing, if for no other reason than I was there. </p> <p>I was born a middle kid in a family of seven children into a John Cheever novel set on the border of Hopkins and Minnetonka, suburbs on the western edge of Minneapolis. It was a suburban idyll where any mayhem was hidden in the rear rooms of large split-level houses. My home was a good one; my parents were kind; no one slipped me a Mickey, and if they had, I would have grabbed it with both hands and asked for another. It is baked into my nature. </p> <p>Let's skip high school. I graduated and travelled out west, hopping on a bus with the so-called Rainbow Family, and on the ensuing ride, they gifted me peyote, a profound sense of life's psychedelic possibilities and a tenacious case of the crabs. I came back to Minneapolis and took crummy jobs, including working at a hydraulic-tube assembly plant, where my boss took Dolly Parton's breasts as his central religious icons. I eventually enrolled in two land-grant universities where I had many friends, very little money and what Pavlov called 'the blind force of the subcortex'. I subsisted on Pop-Tarts and Mountain Dew, along with LSD, peyote, pot, mushrooms, mescaline, amphetamines, Quaaludes, valium, opium, hash and alcohol of all kinds. Total garbage head.</p> <p>On my 21st birthday, a dealer who dropped his money on Dom P\u00e9rignon at the fancy restaurant where I worked palmed me a cigarette tin and told me to open it in the bathroom. I did the powder inside and it was a Helen Keller hand-under-the-water moment. Lordy, I can finally see! My endorphins made a Proustian leap at this new opportunity, hugging it and feeling all its splendid corners.</p> <p>Every addict is formed in the crucible of the memory of that first hit. Even as the available endorphins attenuate, the memory is right there. By 1985, I tried freebasing coke and its more prosaic sibling, crack.</p> <p>'Crackhead' is an embarrassing line to have on a CV. If meth tweakers had not come along and made a grab for the crown \u2013 meth makes you crazy and toothless \u2013 crackheads would be at the bottom of the junkie org chart. In the beginning, smokable cocaine fills you with childlike wonder, a feeling that the carnival had come to town and chosen your cranium as the venue for its next show. Most people who sample it get a sense of its lurid ambush and walk away.</p> <p>Many years later, my pal Donald sat in a cabin in Newport, Minnesota, staring into a video camera I had brought and recalling the crackhead version of me: 'As good friends as we were, as much as I loved you, you weren't you. I wasn't talking to my friend; I was talking to a wild man. You were a creature. I was afraid.'</p> <p>If the subject of careers or majors came up, I told people I was a journalist, with only that uttered noun as evidence. But then I caught a real, actual story for the local weekly and the fever to go with it. I was a dog on a meat bone when it came to stories; I could type \u2013 and sometimes write \u2013 as fast as the next guy, and I had an insatiable need to know more. My work got noticed, and some of the more unfortunate aspects of the guy who produced it were overlooked. I got jobs, nailed investigative targets and won a few awards.</p> <p>During the day, I took the slipperiness of public officials personally \u2013 my moral dudgeon is freighted with irony in retrospect \u2013 and displayed significant promise as a reporter. But as time wore on, I combined a life of early promise as a writer with dark nights full of half-baked gangsters and full-blown addiction. I became a dealer for the creative community in Minneapolis, selling coke to colleagues, comedians and club kids. I was a frantic fan of the amazing Minneapolis music scene at the time \u2013 Soul Asylum, the Replacements, Prince \u2013 but the only thing I played with any regularity was drug-addled fool. I moved grams, eight balls, ounces, quarter pounds \u2013 no one trusted me with a kilo for more than a few minutes. Every day I would wake up to a catalogue of my misbegotten life \u2013 jobs, money, girlfriends and family were all subject to the ineluctable entropy of the junkie lifestyle. </p> <p>There were signs early on that the centre would not hold. In the mid-Eighties, I was working on a running story about a suspect who had been accidentally shot dead while he was being taken into custody by the police department's decoy unit. In the middle of the reporting, my phone rang, and one of the cops from the decoy unit was on the line. 'You know, I've been asking around, and your life is not without blemish,' I remember him saying. 'You better watch your step.' For weeks afterward, I would drive somewhere and see the van from the decoy unit in my rear-view. </p> <p>Some of my running buddies went to prison, but I was more of a misdemeanant, spending hours \u2013 and every once in a while, days \u2013 in various county jails. </p> <p>My duplicity around women was towering and chronic. I conned and manipulated myself into their beds and then treated them like human jewellery, something to be worn for effect. And when I was called to account, <br>I sometimes responded with violence.</p> <p>One night in 1986, I was at a party for Phil, my longtime coke connection who was going away to prison. I met Anna, who had better coke than Phil and soon developed a fondness for me. She was selling serious amounts of coke and allowed me to pretend I was her partner. We were an appalling mix, metastasized by her unlimited supply. In less than a year, I lost my job, and she lost her business.</p> <p>It would have ended there, but on 15 April 1988 Anna had twin girls. My daughters. Our remaining friends had begged us, quite reasonably, to abort them. Pals began to boycott our house because it had become such a grim, near-scientific tableau of addiction's progression.</p> <p>Eventually we both went to treatment, and our kids went into foster care. I sobered up; Anna did, too, until she didn't; and I obtained physical custody of the twins, Erin and Meagan. As a power trio, we worked our way off welfare. I married somebody grand, we had a baby, and professionally one thing led to another, and I ended up working at the New York Times. I have lived most of the last two decades showered by those promises that recovery delivers, with luck, industry and fate guiding me to a life beyond all expectation.</p> <p>But was it really all thus? When memory is called to answer, it often answers back with deception. How is it that almost every warm bar stool contains a hero, a star of his own epic, who is the sum of his amazing stories? </p> <p>If I said I was a fat thug who beat up women and sold bad coke, would you like my story? What if instead I wrote that I was a recovered addict who obtained sole custody of my twin girls, got us off welfare and raised them by myself, even though I had a little touch of cancer? Now we're talking. They are equally true, but as a member of a self-interpreting species, one that fights to keep disharmony at a remove, I'm inclined to mention my tenderhearted attentions as a single parent before I get around to the fact I hit their mother when we were together. We tell ourselves that we lie to protect others, but the self usually comes out looking damn good in the process. </p> <p>The arc of the addict, warm and familiar as a Hallmark movie with only the details pivoting, is especially tidy in the recollection:</p> <p>I had a beer with friends.<br>I shot dope into my neck.<br>I got in trouble.<br>I saw the error of my ways.<br>I found Jesus or 12 steps or bhakti yoga.<br>Now everything is new again.</p> <p>In the convention of the recovery narrative, readers will want to scan past the tick-tock, looking for the yucky part so that they can feel better about themselves. (Here's a taste: when I got to detox for what I thought was the last time, they took one look at my arms and brought me a tub filled with lukewarm water and Dreft detergent to soak my scabrous, pus-filled track marks. They dropped pills into my mouth from several inches away as if feeding a baby bird, and even the wet-brain drunks wouldn't come near me. See how that works?)</p> <p>Today I am a genuine, often pleasant person, I do solid work for a reputable organisation and have, over the breadth of time, proved to be an attentive father and husband. But drugs, it seems to me, do not conjure demons; they reveal them. So how to reconcile my past with my current circumstances? Which, you might ask, of my two selves did I make up?</p> <p>As a veteran journalist, I decided to report the story. For two years on and off, I pulled medical and legal documents and engaged in a series of interviews with people I used to run with. By turns, it became a kind of journalistic ghost dancing, trying to conjure spirits past, including mine. </p> <p>Some people I interviewed wanted me to say I was sorry \u2013 I am, and I did. Some people wanted me to say I remembered \u2013 I did, and I did not. And some people wanted me to say it was all a mistake \u2013 it was, and it was not. It felt less like journalism than archaeology, a job that required shovels and axes, hacking my way into dark, little-used passages. It would prove to be an enlightening and sickening enterprise, a new frontier in the annals of self-involvement. I would show up at the doorsteps of people I had not seen in two decades and ask them to explain myself to me.</p> <p>In drug-gangster movies, the kingpin is always some guy with a pock-marked face who has goombahs at his flanks on the way into the restaurant, sits with his back against the wall and always gets the big piece of chicken. But the most successful person I did business with was just a touch over 5ft, cute, with a full head of dyed blonde hair, a little mouth and a fondness for maniacs in matters of the heart, if not business.</p> <p>When I met Anna, I was more or less living with Doolie, a woman I adored. I began stepping out on her because Anna was in high effect, moving what she said was a kilo a month from straight-up Colombian sources through a series of reliable associates who were also her pals. She worked dead letter boxes in storage spots, safe-deposit boxes and mules to keep her at a distance from the nuts and bolts of the drug enterprise. When the piles of money were too big to hand count, she used a digital scale to weigh piles of twenties. She had two kids in a nice house in north Minneapolis; the serious dope business was done elsewhere. </p> <p>On our first date, we mowed through my eight ball \u2013 an eighth of an ounce \u2013 of indifferent coke. She sent me to a safe under the carpet of her steps, and I beheld a pressed kilo of pure cocaine. Decades later, we were talking outside a hotel in Tucson. She still had no trouble recalling the dimensions of a kilo of coke.</p> <p>'It was about as big as a book, about this big,' she said, framing the air with her hands. 'It still had the snake seals; I mean, it was right from the Medell\u00edn cartel.'</p> <p>It had been 10 years since we had even seen each other. Of all the trips I had taken in pursuit of the past, this was one in which a common truth was unlikely to emerge. We each need to find a place to put our time together that does not leave either of us immobilised with shame. I ended up with our kids, but the moral ground curiously rests with her. I hit her, for one thing. And whatever she did, she did out of a kind of love. My instincts were far more mercenary.</p> <p>In her version, everything was going swimmingly until I came along, and then I seduced her into smoking cocaine. In my version, I lumbered into her life, succumbed to abundant blandishments and descended into a violent, destructive mania. </p> <p>For a time, we were both riding high. I had a budding reputation as a reporter, and she was one of the most respectable sources of serious weight in the city. Anna introduced me to her pals as her trusted associate, but they all knew precisely what I represented: the guy who would ruin a good thing. Certainly she got a primer from me, observing that the difference between snorting and smoking coke was vast.</p> <p>'We fought for about six months about it, and then I joined you,' she remembered. She tipped over almost immediately. By the spring of 1988, six months after we had got together, her business was in disarray, I had lost my job and then, oh, yeah, she was pregnant. Together, Anna and I drew many lines in the sand and then stepped across them, usually with me leading the way.</p> <p>When Anna's waters broke in her living room on Oliver Avenue, I had just handed her a crack pipe. (Anna, by the way, swears such a thing never took place. I have my memories, and she has hers.) She had just entered her third trimester. Were we in the midst of giving birth or participating in a kind of neonatal homicide? The water beneath her became a puddle of implication. Now look what we did.</p> <p>'Man, them are little babies, where'd you get 'em?' The kid, about eight, saw me coming out of the hospital with a twin in each arm in May 1988. I was speechless. How could a child this small, this unknowing, tell at a glance that these children had landed on me from a very great distance?</p> <p>They had been patients in the neonatal intensive care unit for a month. Born at 2.5lb and 2.9lb, and each just over 15in, Meagan and Erin arrived two and a half months premature. According to medical records, which I requested almost 20 years after the fact, Erin 'cried spontaneously, but each time her crying stopped, her heart rate decreased and her respiratory effort became poor. She was intubated in the delivery room ...' Meagan 'had umbilical, artery and venous catheters placed on 16/4/88 for blood pressure and arterial blood-gas monitoring and for delivery of emergency medications.' Once the jaundice of their early birth wore off, they were small pink spots surrounded by an array of tubes and machines, the organic part of the apparatus.</p> <p>As I stared at them in my addled state on visits to the hospital, my mind wandered to bath time, something I had heard that you did with babies. What would we use, a teacup? </p> <p>Once we got the girls home, the heart and respiration monitors seemed designed specifically to terrorise us. One of them would shift positions or spit up a bit, and the alarms would go off. Recently, I went to see a pal, Chris, now a professor of creative writing in New Orleans, who watched the unfurling disaster back then.</p> <p>'One winter night, you called me late and said: \"We're out of diapers, we don't have diapers,\" and you thought somebody was watching the house,' he recalled. 'You guys were paranoid and getting high, and you said, \"I think the cops are watching the house; I can't leave,\" and so I went to the convenience store, got some diapers, drove over, with diapers and milk or something.'</p> <p>Chris did what he could, but other friends thought of calling the authorities. A document I found in the twins' medical files suggested they were already on the case: 'The parents have appeared to be open about their drug use. They have stated their intention to attend AA meetings and provide a chemically free environment for their children. This may be difficult without intervention, considering the long reported history of drug use,' said a letter dated 22 April 1988, from the medical team to Child Protective Services of Hennepin County.</p> <p>I remember driving to a dark spot between the streetlights at the rounded-off corner of West 32nd and Garfield. Right here, I thought. This would be fine.<br>The Nova, a wreck with a bad paint job my brother bought me out of pity, shuddered to a stop, and I saw two sleeping children in the rear-view, the fringe of their hoods emerging in outline against the back seat as my eyes adjusted to the light. Teeny, tiny, itty-bitty, the girls were swallowed by the snowsuits. We should not have been there. But I was fresh out. I had nothing. I called Kenny.</p> <p>Anna was out, and I could not bear to leave them at home, but I was equally unable to stay put. So here we were, one big, happy family, parked outside the dope house. Then came the junkie maths. If I went inside the house, I could get what I needed in five minutes, 10 minutes tops. The twins would sleep, dreaming their little baby dreams where their dad is a nice man, where the car rides end at a playground.</p> <p>The people inside would be busy, working mostly in pairs. Serious coke shooting is something best done together. The objective is to walk right up to the edge of an overdose without actually dying. The technique was to push the plunger in slow but large. One would be pushing, watching as the other listened to the interior sound of blood and nerves brought to a boil. Are you good? Yes. No ... Just, um ... ah ... that's perfect.</p> <p>Kenny's lip-licking coke rap was more ornate, somehow more satisfying, than that of most of the dealers I worked with. His worldview was all black helicopters and white noise \u2013 the whispering, unseen others who would one day come for us. It kept me on my toes.</p> <p>But tonight I had company. I certainly couldn't bring the twins in. Even in the gang I ran with, coming through the doors of the dope house swinging two occupied baby buckets was not done. Sitting there in the gloom of the front seat, the car making settling noises against the chill, I decided that my teeny twin girls would be safe, that God would look after them while I did not.<br>I got out, locked the door and walked away. Inside, a transformation \u2013 almost a kidnapping \u2013 got under way. The guilty father was replaced by a junkie, no different from the others sitting there. Time passed, one thing begot another and eventually I was thrown clear.</p> <p>Leaving, I remember that. Out the metal door and then out the front door with its three bolts onto the porch and the hollow sound of my boots on the wood floor. A pause. How long had it been, really? Hours, not minutes. I walked toward the darkened car with drugs in my pocket and a cold dread in all corners of my being.</p> <p>I cracked the front door, reached around, unlocked the back and leaned in.<br>I could see their breath.</p> <p>God had looked after the twins, and by proxy me, but I realised at that moment that I was in the midst of a transgression He could not easily forgive. I made a decision never to be that man again.</p> <p>In Minneapolis 19 years later, I stood on the spot outside Kenny's where I parked that night. The car was, according to my brother Jim, a Chevy Nova. He sent me the title: '79 Chevy Nova with 89,950 miles on it, plate number NHS091. Thinking back through all those years, I remember standing by the car, I remember looking back in. I remember the maths. And I remember the snowsuits.</p> <p>But that's where the plot thickens and the facts collide. Erin and Meagan were born on 15 April 1988. Whenever I felt compelled to explain myself and the cold facts of our history, that night outside Kenny's was the necessary moment. In the story as I recited it, that horrible night occurred very soon after they were born. I thought I quickly entered treatment because even though I had been an unreliable employee, a conniving friend and a duplicitous husband, nothing in my upbringing allowed me to proceed as a bad father. The twins were then whisked into temporary foster care soon after their birth. After that, it's a Joseph Campbell myth in which our hero embraces his road of trials, begins to attain a new self and hotfoots it back to the normal world.</p> <p>Nice story if you can live it. If the girls were born in April, and I went into treatment a few months afterwards, as I have always said, where did the snowsuits come from? Minnesota is cold, but not that cold.</p> <p>When I was talking to my brother about the make of the car and mentioned the snowsuits, he said: 'That's easy. You didn't go to treatment until sometime in December, like, eight months after they were born.'</p> <p>He's almost right. I did not enter Eden House, a six-month inpatient treatment programme in Minneapolis, until 25 November 1988. So the presence of snowsuits on a cold November night were undoubtedly real. That part about me straightening out right after they were born? A myth, but not the kind Joseph Campbell had in mind.</p> <p>Sometime soon after that night at Kenny's \u2013 the week before Thanksgiving 1988, as I would later find out \u2013 I became convinced that something brutal and unspeakable was about to land on all of us, including the kids. At our house, it was all needles, blood, babies and piles of dirty clothes. High or not, it was hellish to behold. </p> <p>I called my parents and said that if they took the kids, I would go to detox and Anna would go to treatment. 'You told us that there were no adults in the house, that it was a dangerous place for children to be,' my dad recalled, as I talked to him on his deck overlooking Lake Minnetonka in the summer of 2006.</p> <p>Detoxes are really human aquariums, a place where large, Librium-infused humans bob here and there, watched by the staff through thick plate glass in case one of them freaks out or starts flopping around. My job, as it turned out, was to settle my arms up to my biceps in a large tub of Dreft detergent, a nice low-tech way of disinfecting my track marks without involving a lot of hands-on work by the staff. </p> <p>I had become a white-trash untouchable.</p> <p>A few days later, my parents had Thanks-giving dinner, and I came straight from detox. My babies were there. After dinner, my parents spoke to me quietly, off to the side. They had spoken to my older brother, John, who worked in leadership for the Catholic Church, and he had wired up temporary foster care through Catholic Charities. Erin and Meagan would be placed with a family while I went 'to deal with things'. It was decided that I would follow my detox with an intensive six-month rehab programme at Eden House, a last-chance facility in downtown Minneapolis. Eden House was a long-term therapeutic community, the kind of place that brimmed with slogans. This was the main one: 'The answer to life is learning to live.' </p> <p>This is the point where the knowing author laughs along with his readers about his time among the aphorisms, how he was once so gullible and needy that he drank deeply of such weak and fruity Kool-Aid. That's some other story. Slogans saved my life. All of them \u2013 the dumb ones, the imperatives, the shameless, witless ones.</p> <p>I lustily chanted some of those slogans and lived by others. There is nothing romantic about being a crackhead and a drunk \u2013 low-bottom addiction is its own burlesque that needs no scornful annotation. Unless a person is willing to be terminally, frantically earnest, all hope is lost.</p> <p>All the assets I had \u2013 an ability to verbalise, intellectualise and filibuster \u2013 got no play at Eden House. In at least a few other treatment centres, I was often seen as baby Jesus, a counsellor's pet who knew all the jargon and right buttons to push. At Eden House, I was seen as a fool, and a pretty soft one at that. It wasn't Abu Ghraib, but it wasn't the treatment place with the elliptical machine and a staff nutritionist, either.</p> <p>The chronicity of addiction is really a kind of fatalism writ large. If an addict knows in his heart he is going to use someday, why not today? But if a thin reed of hope appears \u2013 the possibility that it will not always be so \u2013 things change. You live another day and then get up and do it again. Hope is oxygen to someone who is suffocating on despair.</p> <p>The implications of a misstep arrived every weekend. My parents would come by with the twins after having picked them up from the foster-care family and set them down to crawl around in the visiting room. I can remember one of the female counsellors \u2013 Beth, maybe \u2013 coming in and marvelling at Erin and Meagan and asking no one in particular whom they belonged to. It took me just a second to realise the answer.</p> <p>'That would be me.'</p> <p>When I got out of Eden House after six months, I moved into a sober house and began taking care of the kids here and there. Anna and I were no longer together, but she had sobered up as well, so the children had been returned to her. But while I was going to recovery meetings and doing my little freelance writing assignments, Anna began struggling. </p> <p>One day in the summer of 1989, I showed up at her house and the twins were wet, hungry and wailing. We went to the nearby 7-Eleven on Penn and Dowling Avenues in north Minneapolis. I waited until the spot right in front of the door opened up, and I went and quickly bought diapers, milk, new bottles and some bananas. While I changed them, they ate the bananas and drank the milk with an animal intensity. I decided not to take them back, not knowing what it meant other than the fact that I would need my own place, more clothes and more money.</p> <p>If I am a good person now and an able father, I must have been the easy choice as custodial parent back in the day. In this formulation, when I started pursuing custody, I was just a beefier version of Mother Teresa, all selflessness and calm, and Anna was a nasty basket case. </p> <p>Eighteen years after the case was decided, I went to see Barbara, the attorney who helped me obtain custody of my daughters. These many years later, Barbara hesitated when I ran that story, and then told a different one. </p> <p>'You looked unwell,' she said. 'You weighed close to 300lb. It was in the winter, and you had on a very heavy coat, but it obviously didn't fit you; it was raggedy. If I had seen you on the street, I would have thought you were homeless, because you were very rough. Your hygiene was bad; your eyes were rheumy.'</p> <p>But I was a man about my business, right?</p> <p>'I wasn't used to having clients look like you. I didn't do criminal; I represented banks and mortgage companies, and so to have you come in and want custody of two little babies, um, I struggled with whether or not that was even a realistic goal that we should consider ... I couldn't tell if you were following along well enough to understand the impact of what this would mean to your life.'</p> <p>So other than being addled from an unspeakable habit, a little smelly and a touch on the amazingly obese scale, I was good to go. Ready to star in one of those car adverts where the kids crack wise in the back seat while the dad says something sage and knowing into the rear-view. Except I didn't have a car. And the kids did not legally belong to me. I had never married their mother or established my paternity. I had no insurance, and I had not paid taxes in several years.</p> <p>Although Anna has always given me abundant credit for doing a good job with our twins, she is quick to remind me that I stole them in the first place. A part of me was convinced she was right. Revisiting the issue with Barbara, I talked about how we managed to persuade Anna to take a drug test when she moved back from Texas, where she had been staying with her mum. We made visits conditional on a clean result, and she came up positive for cocaine and pot. I remembered this as a clever linchpin in our legal strategy, but Barbara reminded me that Anna had failed that test over and over and that she moved in with a dope dealer when she got to town. How she missed appointments to see the kids, missed court dates, switched lawyers and eventually agreed to a settlement that gave me physical custody of the girls. </p> <p>History suggests that things turned out as they should have, but Anna's suggestion that I was not the obvious choice as the twins' custodial parent found significant traction when I went back and looked at the record. I had won a tallest-midget contest with Anna, nothing more. Each of us had a history of relapse, and mine was far more extensive. The lie that I told myself \u2013 that I was made entirely new by my decision to lay off drugs \u2013 kept doubt at bay. If I really examined my fitness in all of its dimensions, I would have been paralysed. It was a fairy tale that kept me alive and allowed me to make it come true. Everything good and true about my life started on the day the twins became mine.</p> <p>When a woman, any woman, has issues with substances, has kids out of wedlock and ends up struggling as a single parent, she is identified by many names: slut, loser, welfare mum, burden on society. Take those same circumstances and array them over a man, and he becomes a crown prince. See him doing that dad thing and, with a flick of the wrist, the mum thing, too! Why is it that the same series of overt acts committed by a male becomes somehow ennobled?</p> <p>I'm not saying that raising children, especially by yourself, is a trip to Turks and Caicos, but single parenting is as old as reproduction. Families declare themselves in all sorts of versions, and ours happened to be two adorable toddlers stapled to 250lb of large, white male. Still, people who knew our circumstances marvelled at the idiosyncrasy. And people who knew me before the twins wondered all the more.</p> <p>I had no idea what I was doing, but children teach you how to care for them. Leave the house without an extra diaper, and they will have some brutal, smelly event at a McDonald's. Let them wheedle their way into your bed so you can get some rest, and you will be fighting them off every single night of their young lives. Gradually, slowly, the three of us developed a routine at bedtime, with baths, prayers and stories \u2013 stuff I had been brought up on or seen on TV. </p> <p>As we spent more time together, they began to know me, and I came to adore them \u2013 madly, deeply, truly. We developed other rituals. When it came time to actually turn out the light, I would sing a song of my own making.<br>To the tune of nothing in particular, but very up-tempo:</p> <p>'Oh, I've got the nicest girls in town,<br>I've got the nicest girls in town.<br>They are so nice, they are so sweet,<br>I love them twice, they can't be beat.'<br>And then, a real strong Broadway finish, with every note held and punished (apologies to Ethel Merman).<br>'Oh. I've. Got. The. Nicest. Girrrrrrrls.<br>Innnnnnn.<br>Townnnnnnn.'</p> <p>It was a huge hit in our crummy little upper duplex, but if that all sounds like some after-school special, with the fat ex-junkie dad singing to his misbegotten daughters, well, it is what it is.</p> <p>I always thought that people who spent endless amounts of time drilling into their personal histories are fundamentally unhappy in their lives, and I'm not. I'm ecstatic in my own dark, morbid way and subscribe to a theory of the past that allows the future to unfold: we all did the best we could.</p> <p>Even with the trope of reporting, my addiction narrative arrives at some very common lessons. Too much of a bad thing is bad. If you don't sleep and eat but drink and drug instead, you will lose jobs, spouses and dignity. And while the lessons of the recovery story are important, they are even more prosaic. Once I stopped doing narcotics and alcohol, I landed good jobs, remarried, had a baby and, of course, learned to love myself.</p> <p>Junkies and drunks frequently end up putting a megaphone to their own pratfalls in the form of a memoir because they need to believe that all of the time they spent with their lips wrapped around glass, whether it was a bottle of vodka or a crack pipe, actually meant something. That impulse suggests that I don't regret the past \u2013 it brought me here to this nice, happy place \u2013 but I'd also like to squeeze something more from it. And so I have.</p> <p>Two years of reporting and a lot of awkward conversations later, I realised that in reductive psychoanalytic terms, I had achieved a measure of integration, not just between That Guy and This Guy but between my past and my present. Carl Jung suggested that until we embrace both our masculine and feminine sides, we can't be made whole. For all the testosterone I have deployed in my affairs, I experienced salvation in expressing common maternal behaviour. You are always told to recover for yourself, but reproduction has an enormously simplifying effect on life: are you willing to destroy others, including little babies, in order to feed the monster within?</p> <p>Not in my case, but it was a much closer call than I would like to admit. I now inhabit a life I don't deserve, but we all walk this earth feeling we are frauds. The trick is to be grateful and hope the caper doesn't end any time soon.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>David Carr is a culture reporter and the media columnist for The New York Times.

  "<p>In Thailand last month an 18-year-old high-school student stabbed a taxi driver to death. When asked why, he replied that it was to see if it was as easy to rob a taxi in real life as it was in his favourite video game, Grand Theft Auto. The Thai government banned the game amid talk of a 'ticking time bomb'. Just the latest in a long-running argument about the damaging effects of violent video games.</p> <p>To objections from the gaming industry, the UK government has just introduced plans for a strict film-style classification system, which may allay parents' fears about violence but seems unlikely to address their concerns about video games in general: that they stifle creativity, hinder social skills and reduce their children to gawping couch potatoes. Video games are back in the firing line.</p> <p>Last Friday saw the release of Spore, one of the industry's most eagerly awaited games. But parents can breathe a sigh of relief, because this isn't some ultra-violent gun-toting gore fest. It's the brainchild of designer Will Wright, which means, in all likelihood, that it will totally rewrite the rules on what we can expect from a video game and prove as popular with parents as it is with kids. Through his games Wright has revolutionised the industry and more than once salvaged its reputation. With his latest he may well do so again. </p> <p>Wright, now 48, is regarded with awe by his peers (even his company Maxis, I'm told, is seen as 'mysterious', squirrelled away in Orinda, California for so long when everyone else was in Silicon Valley), because he has developed an entirely new type of video game. And out of the most unlikely material. </p> <p>SimCity, his breakthrough, is about nothing more elaborate than building a city and following the principles of good town planning. This in a market dominated by fantasy and sci-fi role-play games, sports simulations and first-person shooters. Released in 1989, SimCity (and its spin-offs) have gone on to sell a staggering 17m copies worldwide. But this is nothing compared with his follow-up, The Sims. Probably best described as an interactive doll's house, in which you look after the inhabitants, The Sims boasts sales of more than 100m copies, making it the bestselling PC game of all time. </p> <p>His latest game, Spore, is as ambitious in scope as its predecessors ('How do we deconstruct the universe?' Wright asked by way of introduction at a recent conference). Spore is based loosely on the theory of evolution. Each player starts off as a microbial cell which gradually evolves, through feeding on other organisms and picking up 'DNA points', until it wriggles out of water on to dry land. This creature then hunts and reproduces, eventually banding together to make a tribe, which in turn grows in size and then either by conquering or allying with surrounding settlements turns into a civilisation. </p> <p>Finally you advance far enough to be able to send a rocket up into space for the final stage, in which you jet about the universe in search of planets to colonise and aliens to pester. From single-cell organism to intergalactic empire in one game.</p> <p>With his slightly nerdy haircut and glasses, Wright certainly looks the part. Sitting in his office overlooking San Francisco Bay, he has one leg draped jauntily over the armrest of his chair. Glancing round, there are pointers to Spore everywhere. Pinned to his walls are images from the Hubble Space Telescope (used to recreate star clusters in the game); over his bookshelf a poster of his favourite film, 2001 (by way of homage, when players reach the final space stage, they can drop a black monolith down to the surface of other planets to freak out aliens); on his desk an entomology microscope. 'I've got one at home, too. They're much more interesting than a telescope.' What does he look at? 'Anything. You could put your hand under there and spend an hour looking at it. Fascinating.' In the corridor outside sits a battered doll's house, presumably a leftover from The Sims. </p> <p>Wright is telling me at great speed (he talks with considerable velocity) about the inspirations behind Spore. What follows is typically recondite. 'It's actually an idea you see repeated over and over,' he says. 'The idea of Powers of Ten.' This is a short film by Charles and Ray Eames from 1977 that looks at the universe on various scales, gradually zooming in from the galactic (a view of the entire Milky Way) to the microscopic (quark particles in the nucleus of a carbon atom). 'In fact, Powers of Ten wasn't the first one I discovered. The original idea came from a Dutch schoolteacher named Kees Boeke. He wrote a book in 1957 called Cosmic View: The Universe in 40 Jumps. Boeke's version was amazingly accurate for the time ...' On which he leaps up and snatches down a copy of Boeke's book from the shelf. </p> <p>Wright goes on: 'I remember explaining Spore to the execs at Electronic Arts [EA, the software company that finances and publishes the game] before we had anything to show. I was trying to explain the content, Powers of Ten and all this. It was pretty clear they had no idea what I was talking about. But they were like: \"Sure, do it.\"'</p> <p>Whether they understood or not, Electronic Arts has invested a considerable amount in the game (reportedly $20m). This is not insignificant at a time when the industry, though still thriving, is beginning to question the value of spending millions on one game (a new title, too, not a sequel), particularly given the growing popularity of cheaper, so-called 'casual games'. </p> <p>Casual games include the lucrative field of internet and mobile-phone games as well as PC and console games typified by Guitar Hero (a karaoke-style game) and Dr Kawashima's Brain Training (in which you solve various puzzles to help sharpen your mind). They are simpler in design, shorter in duration, and aimed at a more mainstream audience. The Nintendo Wii console (with its motion-sensitive remote) has been a particular hit, attracting a broad new fanbase with its range of family-friendly titles. I ask Wright how important it is to court this new type of player. 'It's probably the most important thing happening in the gaming industry. We're seeing that with the Nintendo Wii. That pressure to start serving the whole market rather than this little section.' </p> <p>Does he mean appealing to more women? 'That's a big part, but also the intergenerational market. Families. With Wii, you see kids, parents and even grandparents playing together.' Wright already has a good record on this. According to EA, 20 per cent of Sims players are over 35 and 50 per cent are female. </p> <p>For EA, there's a lot riding on Spore (particularly since the company reported losses of $95m earlier this year). At the same time, EA clearly has faith in Wright and has granted him considerable leeway. A great position to be in, I say. 'Yeah. Kind of,' Wright shrugs. 'For The Sims it was very different. I was always having to convince people it would be fun. That was almost more satisfying \u2013 as opposed to whatever stupid thing you say, everybody says: \"Great idea, go do it.\"' It has been six years in development; the big question now is whether Spore can meet those expectations. </p> <p>At this year's Comic-Con in San Diego, a conference for comic-book nerds, video gamers and hardcore Trekkies, Wright gave a speech in which he said he believed video games had a role in helping people understand sciences. Spore, he said, would make science 'accessible and not academic'. It's a recurring theme in the way he talks about his work: games as semi-educational. </p> <p>How important is it that his games teach as well as entertain? 'I'm not sure teach is the right word,' he says. 'Computer games and simulations are much more powerful [as an aid] to motivate than to teach. I'd rather have a game that got a person interested in the subject than tried to put a lot of facts into their head. It's not a matter of sugarcoating education. Education when done right is inherently fun. There shouldn't be a difference between the two. Our culture has disconnected the ideas of education and fun \u2013 and if anything, I'm trying to reconnect those two things.' </p> <p>It goes back to the way Wright himself was taught. Raised in Atlanta, Georgia, the son of a plastics engineer and an actress, Wright attended a Montessori school up to the age of nine (his 'high point of education'). 'The basis was that you wanted kids to discover principles on their own. Montessori designed toys so kids could discover aspects of maths or geometry just from playing. The kid made the discovery, and it was much more effective than the teacher coming over and saying, \"Here's Pythagorean theory,\" or whatever.' Wright has likened his own games to 'modern Montessori toys'. </p> <p>As a child, he'd immerse himself in pet subjects for months, reading everything he could. Space exploration was a passion. Another was Harry Houdini (a rub-off from his mother, who was an amateur magician. 'I learned how to pick locks,' he says). The Second World War was an obsession, too. 'I had a friend down the street \u2013 we were both into World War Two history and used to play these elaborate historical video games recreating the Battle of Kursk or whatever.' He also built a lot of models: 'ships, cars, planes, mostly from kits'.</p> <p>When Wright was nine his father died of leukaemia and he moved with his mother and younger sister to Baton Rouge, Louisiana. There he enrolled in the Episcopal High School and duly became an atheist. After graduating he took off to Louisiana State University to study architecture, transferred a few years later to Louisiana Tech for mechanical engineering, dropped out, drove a bulldozer for a summer and in 1980 landed up at New School, New York, studying robotics. Robots then led to computers: 'I got fascinated, totally dived in and learned how to programme.' Video games were taking off at the time. 'I thought: people are actually making money from these games. I'll try it. More as an intellectual challenge; I didn't expect to make money.' Wright's first game, programmed on his Commodore 64, was Raid on Bungeling Bay ('this stupid helicopter shoot 'em up') which Broderbund, a small software company, brought out in 1984. It was a fair success, earning Wright enough to live on for a couple of years. That same year, Wright married Joell Jones, the older sister of one of his friends, and two years later they had a daughter, Cassidy. (The couple have recently separated.)</p> <p>While developing Bungeling Bay, Wright became fascinated by a tangential aspect to the game. 'Underneath was a fairly elaborate simulation of factories and towns, a whole infrastructure that wasn't apparent to the player. I was having a lot more fun building that world than bombing it.' How about a game based on that, he thought, where you build your own urban environment. He threw himself into background reading. 'I uncovered the work of Jay Forrester, who wrote a book called Urban Dynamics in 1969,' Wright tells me, before citing other sources, including John Conway's 1970 Game of Life and the 'cell automata' work of a little-known scientist named Liman Wang. </p> <p>The prototype game Wright came up with was a radical departure in gaming terms. In it the player would oversee the development of an entire city, laying roads, building schools and hospitals, installing infrastructure, all the time balancing a long list of interdependent variables (crime rates, population levels, popularity ratings, taxes). Persuading software company Broderbund to back it was no breeze. 'When I first showed them SimCity they were a little confused. I got to this stage where I thought it was done, but they kept expecting it to have this win/lose element. I kept saying: \"No. This is the way it is.\"' Broderbund ended up not publishing, and it sat on Wright's shelf for a few years. </p> <p>Enter Jeff Braun, Wright's future business partner. They met in 1987 at a friend's pizza party in Alameda, California. When Wright showed him his demo, Braun got very excited. Having previously developed fonts for the computer firm Atari, Braun was keen to get into games. Here was the perfect vehicle. 'He's a very bubbly guy,' Wright says of Braun. 'He said: \"I want to play this \u2013 this is great\" and persuaded me to start this company with him to develop it.' Which they did. Two years later Maxis published SimCity. Though not an instant hit, it went on to earn $230m worldwide. </p> <p>The idea for Wright's next game came when his house burned down in an Oakland Hills fire in 1991. Forced to replace all his possessions \u2013 everything from kitchen utensils to furniture, which he hated doing \u2013 Wright got thinking about the value of all this stuff. Which sparked an idea: a game about running a household. But how to make it work? Wright read extensively on human behaviour and systems design: books like A Pattern Language by Christopher Alexander, A Theory of Human Motivation by Abraham Maslow and Maps of the Mind by Charles Hampden-Turner, which provided guiding principles for scoring the happiness of players in the game he came up with. </p> <p>The Sims, based in a suburban home, required that players tend to the various needs \u2013 from dietary to social \u2013 of its family of inhabitants. That meant everything from taking them to the bathroom and getting them to clean, to cooking them dinner. Arguably Wright's greatest achievement was making housework fun. Launched in 2000, The Sims was an instant hit. <br>Three years earlier, Maxis had been bought out by Electronic Arts for $125m. Wright walked away from the deal with a reported $17m in EA stock. The Sims and its spin-offs have since gone on to earn EA in the region of $4bn. </p> <p>A month now before Spore ships, the pressure on the team at Spore HQ is easing up. The main office \u2013 airy, wood-beamed and half empty today \u2013 is covered with Spore flowcharts, storyboards and brainstorming sessions. For Wright, there's time to pause, too, though not for long \u2013 an exhaustive promotional world tour kicks off in a few weeks. 'I prefer to be making the game than talking about it,' he says.</p> <p>Does it bother him that video games are looked down on by so many? 'There are two ways of looking at that. Yeah, this bias against this form of media causes tension. But at the same time, there's some value in being a renegade. Like rock'n'roll. Something that parents don't like, kids are much more into it.' But if video games are rock'n'roll, I say, his games are more like the Beatles than, say ... 'Metallica?' he chimes in. 'Probably. My games tend to be more cross-generational. More accessible. I think parents would rather see their kids play The Sims than Counter-Strike.' No wonder. The first is about family life, the second a violent terrorist-based first-person shooter. </p> <p>But Wright is quick to defend games like Counter-Strike. 'It's funny,' he says. 'If [parents] are just observing the game and not playing it themselves, they're just seeing a surface representation: the pixels on the screen, the explosions, the gunshots. But if you look at kids playing Counter-Strike or [another first-person shooter] Quake, it's really more of a sport. They're very social experiences; they're not antisocial at all. It's all about working together as a team, getting their friends together \u2013 sometimes it's more like playing a game of basketball. If parents could see what the kids were seeing on the screen in a social sense, they would have a totally different perspective on it.' </p> <p>Agree or not, it's Wright in a nutshell. The Montessori defence, you might say: nothing beats playing the game yourself \u2013 and every game, violent or not, has something to teach us. Providing we have a go.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Spore is on sale now</p>",
  "<p>Hurricane Ike roared ashore in Texas yesterday, scoring a direct hit on the town of Galveston and bringing widespread chaos and disruption to millions in Houston.</p> <p>The gigantic storm, which has left a trail of death and destruction across the Caribbean, forced a massive wall of water over the Texan coastline, reminiscent of the devastating Hurricane Katrina that smashed New Orleans in 2005. Fearing a repeat of such a disaster Texas officials had urged residents of low-lying coastal areas to flee, warning that they faced 'certain death' if they stayed. </p> <p>More than a million people obeyed the orders to leave. However, it is believed 140,000 residents stayed behind to try to ride out the storm. Early reports indicated that Ike will have caused massive damage from its powerful winds of 100mph or more and the surge of floodwaters, which could top 7m high. More than four million people lost power as electricity lines were blown down. So far at least three people have died, including a young child.</p> <p>There has been extensive damage from flooding and fires that raged out of control and out of the reach of emergency services. Rescue teams of firefighters and police were preparing to save many of those who stayed behind and would now be cut off by floodwaters or trapped in damaged buildings. </p> <p>'We'll probably do the largest search and rescue operation that's ever been conducted in the state of Texas,' said Andrew Barlow, spokesman for Texas governor Rick Perry.</p> <p>The eye of the storm made an early-morning landfall at Galveston, a pretty resort town on the Texas coast which was destroyed by a hurricane more than a hundred years ago that cost thousands of lives and remains the worst natural disaster in American history. </p> <p>By passing over Houston, Ike was also the first major hurricane to hit a big US city since Katrina. It was the first to hit Houston and Galveston since 1983, when a storm powered ashore killing 21 people and causing $2bn of damages.</p> <p>Ike was packing wind speeds of 110mph when it struck Galveston, putting it at a very strong Category Two storm. However, it was the sheer size of the storm that was the main worry. The giant weather system was almost as big as Texas itself.</p>",
  "<p>Inside Denver's sold-out, packed-to-the-girders, cacophonously loud Invesco stadium, it's a few minutes to showtime. The crowd are shouting and singing and chanting and doing the Mexican wave. 'YES WE CAN!' they roar, unprompted, repeatedly. You can't buy beer today (although bags of Original Presidential Roast coffee are available from the merchandise stalls, $10 a pop) but everyone's drunk on excitement. Or wired on the nachos' neon-orange cheese sauce. </p> <p>The support acts have done their turns: the soul icon (Stevie Wonder), the Starbucks folkie (Sheryl Crow), the conscious R&amp;B brainbox (John Legend), the celebrity hip hopper (Black Eyed Peas' will.i.am), the baby-boomer comfort-crooner (Michael McDonald).</p> <p>Up on the roofs, the Swat spotters scan the vast arena with binoculars. Down on the floor, there's a minor kerfuffle as the Rev Al Sharpton arrives. Agents in suits and sunglasses touch their earpieces. There's George Lucas. Spike Lee's in the house, declaring the night is 'bigger than the Super Bowl!' There's Jin from Lost, Jessica Alba from Hollywood, Shawn Johnson from the Olympics (the gold medal-winning gymnast recites the Pledge of Allegiance). Al Gore, a bunch of generals, President Eisenhower's granddaughter and various Washington big-hitters file on and off stage. </p> <p>But it's the musicians who have kept the six hour show on the road until the headline act arrives. There has been no sign of Joss Stone, who will be singing on an election song, but Fergie has been spotted, so it's not all good news. American Idol runner-up turned Oscar-winner Jennifer Hudson sang'The Star-Spangled Banner'. It was the second Denver gig for five-time-Grammy-winner Legend, who earlier in the week had unveiled a new song, 'If You're Out There', which had been billed as 'an anthemic call to action and evocation of human potential'. It went: 'We're the generation/ We can't afford to wait/ The future started yesterday/ And we're already late.'<br> Me and California indie-blues band Cold War Kids, we're already late too. Mainly because we've spent the afternoon standing in the longest queue I've ever experienced. In 89C heat we shuffled round parking lots, along back alleys, down grassy knolls, into narrowed pens. We were harangued en route by all manner of pedlars (everything from souvenir water to souvenir hand-towels) and protesters waving banners: Bring The Troops Home; Don't Invade Iran; Impeach Bush; Forget John McCain, Love Hillary Clinton; Forget Hillary Clinton, Love Jesus; No, Love Communism. And we were shepherded all the way by an army of cops.</p> <p>We did this, the shuffle-queuing, for three hours. That's what happens when 84,000 people turn up to hear a senator speak, and when the Secret Service are checking everyone's bags. That's what happens when Barack Obama comes to town, to the home of the Denver Broncos American football team, to deliver the most important speech of his career. Welcome to stadium politics. It's like stadium rock, only the sound is better.</p> <p>This is, as one of the most popular T-shirts has it, Barack And Roll. And this is Denver, Colorado during the Democratic National Convention 2008, the four-day razzmatazz event at which the party officially selects Obama as its candidate to fight November's presidential election against the Republicans' Vietnam war hero John McCain. The legacy of two epochal events hangs in the ether: Obama is speaking on the 45th anniversary of Martin Luther King's 'I Have a Dream' speech, and it's 40 years since Chicago '68, the infamous Democratic Convention that followed the assassination of another People's Politician, Robert F Kennedy , and which descended into brutally suppressed riots.</p> <p>All over town there are rallies, meetings, parties, protests, law enforcement of every stripe and gun calibre, and 15,000 representatives of the global media. The celebrity contingent ranges from Ben Affleck and Charlize Theron to Muhammad Alivia the hot-ticket Vanity Fair bash. The accredited bloggers, all 500 of them, have their own tent. That's a lot of hot air and electromagnetic radiation zooming up into the Rocky Mountains. No wonder everyone in the Mile High City this week is a little, well, crazed. And there are bands. Rage Against the Machine do a free gig then lead 5,000 anti-war protesters on a demo. NERD play a Rock the Vote show. Kanye West performs a keynote concert, as is increasingly usual for him, way past everyone's bedtime. And it's not just the hip hop community who are turning out for the politico with Jay-Z on his iPod and on speed dial. The indie kids are here in force, too, with Cold War Kids joining Jenny Lewis, Clap Your Hands Say Yeah! and Death Cab For Cutie at a hipster art event called Manifest Hope. Beat that, Cool Britannia.</p> <p>Manifest Hope encompasses an exhibition and two gigs: an open-air early evening freebie and a late night 'VIP invite-only' show with Zooey Deschanel, the Hollywood actress who, as She &amp; Him, made the recent (and very good) album Volume One with singer-songwriter M Ward. Support comes from super-hot comedian Sarah Silverman, and from the mayor of Seattle (who mentions his city's proud grunge heritage).</p> <p>The DNC '08 is a rock'n'roll event for a rock'n'roll candidate, who has been feted on the cover of Rolling Stone and Spin. The singalong slogans are all over the place, on T-shirts, posters and banners. Barack The Vote. The New American Dream. A Legacy Of Hope. Change We Can Believe In. It's Time! The Real Deal. Obama In The House. Rock'n'roll candidate: that sounds fatuous, but it's still true. Obama \u2013 young, gifted and black \u2013 is treated like a rock star by the cool kids. Boy, do they think he's a rock star.</p> <p>'Portraiture is something I've always done of my music heroes \u2013 Joe Strummer, Bob Marley, Joey Ramone, Henry Rollins,' says Shepard Fairey, 38. He's the Los Angeles-based graphic artist whose stature in the US is akin to Banksy's here. Inspired by the presidential hopeful's message, Fairey designed two posters, titled Hope and Change. He's wearing a badge that says 'Obama' in the font used by AC/DC. 'My Obama poster is in the tradition of my work, to put people I think are trailblazers on a pedestal.'</p> <p>The posters were an instant pop-culture and blogosphere sensation in the US, and Fairey received a personally signed thank you note from Obama. They catalysed this week's Manifest Hope exhibition: a collection of Obama art submitted by creative figures from the graffiti, hip hop and urban scenes. It fills 10,000sq ft of gallery space in a grungily cool Denver neighbourhood. 'Just look around the exhibition at all these images of him,' says David Choe, 32, from New York, who contributed a spraycan work titled Hussein (Obama's middle name). 'He's not even human any more, he's like Jesus. He's become a symbol.'</p> <p>Why are Cold War Kids \u2013 whose Robbers &amp; Cowards debut was one of the critical hits of 2006 , and who share management with the White Stripes and Vampire Weekend \u2013 here? </p> <p>'We have always thought that the size of your band is directly in proportion to the size of your influence,' says singer Nathan Willett . It's an obvious point but stick with him; Cold War Kids are viscerally exciting on record (imagine Tom Waits fronting a de-techno'd Radiohead) but they're sober and methodical in speech. 'To be a political band without having any influence is really kinda silly and dogmatic,' he continues. 'But if you have influence and you can use it productively, that's great.' With their imminent second album, Loyalty to Loyalty, attracting advance raves, the savvy band are aware of their burgeoning heft \u2013 and of the promotional/fun possibilities. 'We're newly in a place where we have a little spotlight. And,' Willett adds, 'it's nice to play a little party.' Especially a party taking place during an event at which history is being made.</p> <p>The day before Barack Obama's Invesco Field speech, the Manifest Hope street bash is teeming. Will.i.am tours the exhibition; earlier this year he created the Obama mash-up 'Yes We Can ' featuring extracts from the senator's speeches and vocals from, among others, Scarlett Johansson. Spike Lee has already swung by, reportedly buying myriad prints of the exhibited art.</p> <p>At the entrance to the gallery is a poster declaring Obama a 'champion of the arts', and setting out his platform in this area. This includes: creating an arts corps that will work in low-income schools and communities; supporting increased funding for the National Endowment For the Arts (whose budget has been cut from $175m per annum in 1992 to $125m pa today); and providing healthcare and ensuring tax fairness for artists. No wonder the arts community are firmly onside. </p> <p>'Before Obama kids were not rocking politicians on their T-shirts and buying posters,' says artist Sam Flores, 32, from San Francisco, who has contributed New America, an acrylic and aerosol artwork to the show. 'But art and music and urban culture is helping bring them in \u2013 now everyone is making an effort to be part of politics. It's not just because he's the first black candidate \u2013 he represents ideas and openness.'</p> <p>The political thinking behind the exhibition, says excited gallery co-owner Tom Horne, is to say to young people: 'If these awesome, world famous, rad artists are getting together for this cause, YOU CAN TOO!'</p> <p>New York artist Ron English's Abraham Obama is one of the most striking pieces (his point, he says, is that the allegedly 'inexperienced' senator of four years standing has just as much experience of office as did America's favourite President). At 49, English is less prone to being swept up in the giddy Obamania. 'Most smart politicians in history, even the most evil ones like Hitler, used music and art,' he says. ''Cause art and music is how you get to people's hearts and souls.'</p> <p>Cold War Kids are also wary of being reduced to Obama cheerleaders. Formerly students at a Christian college, they're more about ideas than political partisanship \u2013 they wouldn't necessarily be turning up for congratulatory drinkies at the White House. Their second album's title, Loyalty to Loyalty, was inspired by the writings of Josiah Royce , a late 19th-century philosopher and proto-socialist from California. They're big fans of author David Foster Wallace , quoting on their website his thoughts on how the most effective new rebels might be the ones with old fashioned values.<br> 'The biggest objective Wallace wants to get across is to turn away from a style of writing that is ironical and sarcastic,' says Willett, 'and point towards a much more genuine and sincere style of communication. A lot of people have talked about that with Obama \u2013 from his mannerisms to his speech, he's a very sincere guy, a genuine character.</p> <p>Like U2 in a suit, Obama's sincerity and abstract but powerful quasi-spiritual messages \u2013 Change We Can Believe In; Yes We Can \u2013 are certainly inspiring near-fanatical enthusiasm among youth voters previously untouched, in every sense, by politics.</p> <p>Annie, 20, and Sam Woods, 24, have put their hearts, souls and lives into Obama. Sam spent two days covering her 1990 Volvo 240 DL in 520 Obama stickers. The sisters then drove the 1,200 miles to Denver from their home in Santa Cruz, California, blogging and selling stencilled Obama T-shirts along the way. Out in the street, as the bands soundcheck in the late afternoon heat, there is a huge buzz of interest in the sisters' car. They hand out cards for their Drive the Movement website (<a href=\"http://www.obamamobileusa.com\">obamamobileusa.com</a>). Why have they done all this? </p> <p>'Because change happens from the bottom up,' says Annie, 'and we want to be part of that. Obama is historic. What's happening now is monumental.'<br> 'Before Obama politics was this exclusive, I-have-money-and-we're-gonna-rule type government,' says Sam. 'Whereas now it's flipped \u2013 young people are involved, and all these artists and musicians are coming from the ground up and being inspired.' </p> <p>I hear similar zeal from the eager fans watching Cold War Kids that evening. Their short outdoor set \u2013 introduced by the mayor of Long Beach (like a proper politico, he's riding the slipstream of his up'n'coming hometown boys) and watched by the mayor of San Francisco (who looks like a catalogue model, or Eighties TV character Max Headroom) \u2013 is brilliant. Willett, bass player Matt Maust , guitarist Jonnie Russell and drummer Matt Aveiro throw themselves into the turbulent likes of the last album's 'Hang Me Up to Dry ' and the new one's 'Welcome to the Occupation '. </p> <p>'It's really important to see bands like Cold War Kids playing \u2013 we respect them and so we respect the things they stand up for,' says Sam Britten, 23, from Denver as they troop off stage. She's wearing a T-shirt made by a local artist. 'It's Time For A Democratic Party', it says, over a picture of Obama. While in college she helped register voters, focusing on 18- to 24-year-olds. 'And we could do nothing to get them to the polls or care about the issues. But here there are entire galleries in Denver filled with art devoted to Obama.' White-haired, 72-year-old millionaire John McCain, 'he can't do that!'</p> <p>'I'm here 'cause I love music, and I love Obama,' says Nasir Malik, a 20-year-old local with an Obama badge pinned to his baseball cap. 'He incites change. I've never felt that before, not in the right way. Good change, not a negative change.' </p> <p>Julia Rosen, 27, from Sacramento, is wearing a T-shirt that says 'I Blogged Your Girlfriend'. She's covering the convention for political website Calitics. 'As bloggers, the Obama campaign have empowered us to be their spokespeople. And they've very much decentralised the campaign. Young people are not watching the nightly news or reading newspapers much, so they get their news from alternative sources, whether that's The Daily Show or musicians or other trusted sources. They'll be like, \"Oh yeah, Cold War Kids were talking up Obama last night and the concert was awesome.\" Them telling five friends that, who then tell five other friends, that's what's going to get the youth out to vote and win him the election.' </p> <p>But what if all this is just ammo for the Republican charge that Barack Obama is just a celebrity? A smiley fella who likes the limelight and the famous supporters more than he likes the nitty-gritty of reforming tax policy, weaning America off its oil addiction and sorting out the mess in Iraq and Afghanistan?</p> <p>Ron English, artist: 'The only reason he's a \"celebrity\" is because people love him.'</p> <p>Jonnie Russell, Cold War Kid: 'It's definitely a danger, a slippery slope. But it happens on both sides \u2013 you've got Ted Nugent supporting the Republicans.'</p> <p>Shepard Fairey, artist: 'The concept of \"celebrity\" is that they're elite and untouchable. That's not Obama.'</p> <p>Sam Wood, activist: 'Is Obama a celebrity or a rock star? Hey, aren't we all rock stars? I don't think it should hurt him. It should empower people, the fact that he has that image. For years our presidents have been old white guys. He's in touch with our generation.'</p> <p>The following night's event at Invesco Stadium is a thrilling thing to behold. It is more rock'n'roll than any actual stadium concert I've ever been to. Once the deafening cheers greeting his arrival on stage have eventually subsided, Barack Obama rises to the occasion, showing his teeth at last and laying into McCain with a series of trenchant critiques and funny one-liners. No more Mr Nice Guy. And he off ers up impressive detail on a range of policy changes. No more Mr Celebrity. Well, as non-celebrity as the star of one of the biggest speeches by a politician in recent American history can be. At home, 38.4 million Americans are watching on TV. </p> <p>Inside this huge arena, the 84,000 excited fans lap up Obama's 45-minute set. If he could have done an encore (one short, catchy paragraph, say), they'd have gone even crazier. Then, a family hug, fireworks, confetti cannon and a vast, fluttering ocean of American flags. And there's one final musical trick: as Obama leaves the stage, Bruce Springsteen's 'Born in the USA' blares out across the stadium. Finally, a more fitting political context after the Reagan Republicans' mid-Eighties' misappropriation of The Boss's blue collar anthem.</p> <p>As we file out, a teenage girl approaches Cold War Kid Matt Maust and asks for an autograph. Alyson King, 16, is from Long Beach too. She came all this way for the Convention; seeing a show last night by a band from her hometown was an awesome bonus.</p> <p>Does she think an indie band can help the Democrats win the presidency after eight years of Bush?</p> <p>'Cold War Kids playing totally helps the cause. It gets the word out. As an artist, a public figure, you have to carry some responsibility and stand up to the challenges that face society.'</p> <p>And how was the Obama show?</p> <p>'Oh,' she beams, 'he rocked.'</p> <p>We filed out into the balmy, barmy Denver night. It's all over \u2013 bar the voting.</p> <h2>Obama V McCain: The music battle</h2> <p>Both presidential candidates recently revealed their 10 favourite songs and one - Barack Obama - is clearly more the rocker.

  "<p>Not satisfied with control of the drug trade, building industry and rubbish collection in Naples, the local mafia is getting into the bakery trade and ensuring that Neapolitans rely on the mob for their daily bread.</p> <p>According to a report released last week, city officials and investigators suspect Camorra clans are behind many of the 1,400 unlicensed backstreet bakeries in and around the city which supply hundreds of street vendors who sell loaves out of car boots - and they may be spreading into selling other basic food products.</p> <p>Open 24 hours a day, the street sellers are drawing shoppers with cheap, crusty bread fresh from wood-burning ovens, the way Neapolitans like it. But police say Naples' new breed of bakers are slowly poisoning their customers by burning old varnished wood, nut shells covered in pesticides and even planks pulled from exhumed coffins. 'Whoever buys this bread is eating dioxins and carcinogenic substances and putting their health at serious risk,' said Francesco Borrelli, assessor for agriculture for the province of Naples.</p> <p>Borrelli's investigation into the underground bakeries prompted raids by Carabinieri police who found dough being mixed by illegal immigrant labour in filthy, humid and mould-streaked cellars, some perilously close to burning piles of toxic waste dumped in fields around Naples by the Camorra, which was linked earlier this year to suspected tainting of local mozzarella.</p> <p>The capital for clandestine ovens is Afragola, a small town outside Naples where one of the Camorra clans operates. In addition to the town's 17 legal bakeries, 100 underground operations were discovered.</p> <p>Across the province it is a business worth \u20ac600m a year, the bulk of which is controlled by mobsters, said Borrelli. Scores of bakeries have been shut down, but a report to the police by Borrelli's team last week revealed that owners are ripping off police seals and restarting operations. 'If you open one up, you need to talk to the clans first, and where there's easy money and illegal activity, the Camorra will want in,' added one investigator. Illegal bread-sellers redoubled their efforts over the August holiday period to take advantage of the closure of regular bakers. With illegal ovens accounting for almost half of the total around Naples, the city's honest bakers last year handed out 20,000 free loaves to try to win back customers.</p> <p>But the mob is just getting started, said Borrelli. 'We believe the clans are now forcing legitimate middlemen to buy the bread and sell it on to food stores owned by the same clans, issuing regular receipts in the process and turning it into a handy money-laundering opportunity.' A quarter of Naples' 'illegal' bread was now being sold in shops, he added.</p> <p>Green party politician Tommaso Pellegrino said the Camorra was giving jobs in its bakeries to mobsters just out of jail and in need of work. </p> <p>Building on its bakery success, the Camorra is now branching out. 'Bread is the core business,' said Borrelli, 'but as food prices rise the mob is moving into fruit, vegetables and fish, all sold at low prices.' Whether it is strawberries grown on toxic waste dumps or bread baked in cancerous wood smoke, cut-price mafia food comes at a price, he said.</p>",
  "<p>However you look at it, Robert Mugabe is getting away with murder. The power-sharing deal he is expected to sign tomorrow with his arch-rival, Morgan Tsvangirai, will protect Zimbabwe's president and his cohorts from prosecution for their bloody campaign of killings and terror against opposition supporters and their leaders.</p> <p>Mugabe will remain president, even though his claim of winning 90 per cent of the valid votes in June's election was met with universal scorn after Tsvangirai pulled out because he did not want people killed going to vote for him. </p> <p>The last time Zimbabwe's voters had a chance to cast a ballot without a gun to their heads, in the first round of presidential elections in March, Tsvangirai won. And that was with millions of opposition voters in exile and a good deal of other kinds of intimidation by the ruling Zanu-PF party.</p> <p>Now Mugabe will sit at the head of a cabinet half filled with men responsible for robbing Tsvangirai of that victory by murdering, beating and terrorising the supporters - and sometimes the families - of the other half of the cabinet. When they weren't doing that, they were looting the central bank, stealing land and driving the economy into the ground through incompetence and cynicism, leaving millions on the brink of starvation.</p> <p>So an agreement that persuades the opposition to recognise Mugabe as president and keeps Zanu-PF's killers and looters out of jail might be viewed as a great victory for the old man. Yet the historic deal holds the elements to dismantle Mugabe's 28-year rule and reduce the power of the only leader Zimbabwe has known until a clean election can be held.</p> <p>Behind the scenes, Movement for Democratic Change leaders are calling the agreement a watershed. Some quietly realise that Monday could mark the end of their struggle to finish Zanu-PF's abusive and sometimes violent political domination - the second liberation struggle, as one put it - and the beginning of the equally demanding challenge to take control of government. </p> <p>If they can pull it off - and, in many ways, whether they succeed or fail lies within the MDC's control, not Zanu-PF's - then Mugabe's pledge that Tsvangirai would never rule Zimbabwe, and his bloody strategy to try to ensure it did not happen, will ultimately have failed.</p> <p>It is a complex arrangement, but the nuts and bolts of the agreement are that while Mugabe is president, Tsvangirai has day-to-day control of government as prime minister and head of a council of ministers. That is a considerable asset, even though many of his ministers will be from Zanu-PF. Tsvangirai will run the council of ministers without Mugabe present, but will sit in the cabinet chaired by the president. </p> <p>Crucially, the two MDC factions have a majority of one in both bodies, as well as control of parliament, allowing the party to out-vote Mugabe and set policy. That will allow the MDC to dismantle the apparatus of repression which helped keep Mugabe in power long after his popularity crumbled. The government will be able to abolish legislation banning newspapers, locking up journalists and imposing severe restrictions on freedom of speech. </p> <p>Tsvangirai is counting on the support of civil servants and others, who, like most middle-class urbanites, have long backed the MDC but have been afraid to say so in public. The devil may be in the detail, which won't be made public until after the agreement is signed, but Tsvangirai's aides say there are no hidden trip wires.</p> <p>Much will also depend on the division of ministries, which the two leaders were wrangling over yesterday. Mugabe is expected to keep his hands on the military through a Zanu-PF defence minister, which the MDC can live with because it will help reassure the generals. Tsvangirai has pressed hard for control of the police, which is crucial if he hopes to assure people that they can vote as they wish in future elections. Both sides are pressing to run the justice ministry, but that may be one that Tsvangirai loses because of fears within Zanu-PF that if he controls the police and the justice system the MDC could hold the guilty to account.</p> <p>Crucially, the MDC is likely to get the finance portfolio because foreign donors will not want to hand money over to a Zanu-PF minister. It is the prospect of that money that unlocked the prospect of agreement. Without power for Tsvangirai there will be no foreign aid, and without hard currency Mugabe had no means of turning around an imploding economy.</p> <p>The numbers are staggering. Inflation is running above 20 million per cent a year. Unemployment is 80 per cent. A quarter of the population has left to look for work in South Africa and Britain.</p> <p>The central bank knocked ten zeros off the Zimbabwe dollar at the beginning of last month because shops and banks could not cope with calculations in the trillions. When it was launched on 1 August, the new dollar was Z$4 to the pound, but the black market immediately offered Z$25. Since then, the currency has crashed so fast that the black market rate is Z$13,000 to the pound. The new banknotes are worthless and the government does not have the means to print new money. Last week, it announced that it would legalise the use of US dollars and South African rand, although these are already the de facto currencies.</p> <p>This weekend, there were long queues for petrol after the pipeline from Mozambique was shut down over unpaid bills. Outside the cities, chronic malnutrition is on the way to becoming starvation. The World Food Programme says it will have to feed up to five million Zimbabweans in the coming months.</p> <p>The new government will be desperate to see foreign money soon, so that Tsvangirai can show he can deliver some relief to a distressed population. But Western governments have said they want to wait and see if Tsvangirai is really wielding power, fearing that he may have been duped into a deal that allows Mugabe to outmanoeuvre him. </p> <p>However, this will be a hard position for Britain and others to maintain. They face being accused of neo-colonialism if they fail to embrace what is being billed as an African solution to an African problem and endorsed by all the major political players in Zimbabwe. </p> <p>Whether Tsvangirai actually does hold power will depend in large part on whether he can form a working relationship with the leader of the smaller breakaway faction of his party, Arthur Mutambara. That may prove too much for the two leaders who have not always put the country above personal or political interests.</p> <p>Mutambara, a scientist, has scorned Tsvangirai as ill-educated and an incompetent political leader. Meanwhile, Tsvangirai's followers see Mutambara as a political opportunist out for personal gain. Their fears have been reinforced by his willingness to play footsie with Zanu-PF because, although the Mutambara faction only won 8 per cent of the vote in the election, it holds the balance of power both in parliament and the cabinet. </p> <p>But Mutambara has been reined in by his own MPs and will have to be careful not to overplay his hand. If he is seen by the voters to be extending Mugabe's grip they will make him and his MPs pay at the next election.</p> <p>Although Mugabe and Zanu-PF will attempt to widen the divisions between the MDC factions and buy off its ministers, the MDC's future is in its own hands. If it puts the people before self-interest, and Tsvangirai and Mutambara can set aside their deep personal animosity, then it can set the agenda and transform Zimbabwe. Mugabe will not be without power, but he may be reduced to obstructing more than governing. He could probably bring down the new administration, but he is also only signing the agreement in the first place because he has no other options.</p> <p>Meanwhile, a coalition government is likely to change the political equation for good. Power sharing worked well in smoothing the transition from white rule in post-apartheid South Africa, where a sunset clause meant there would not be an immediate wholesale purge of the former administration and those who served it.</p> <p>That may be all the more important in Zimbabwe, where the deep loathing and suspicion between the two sides is personal, and Zanu-PF chiefs regard Tsvangirai with contempt for his lack of liberation struggle credentials.</p> <p>Yet there are many in Zanu-PF who realise that if their party is to have a future it is without Mugabe as leader, and that crippling the coalition administration will do nothing to rebuild the party's fortunes. Throughout all of this, Tsvangirai will have to stay focused on getting to another election swiftly and with his credibility intact.</p> <p>The agreement plans a new constitution within 18 months. The MDC wants to see an election within two years or so. Unless Tsvangirai messes it up completely - and it's hard to imagine that life will not improve if the foreign money comes in - then the voters will bury Mugabe. </p> <p>Zimbabwe's president will probably never be tried for his many crimes. But tomorrow he may well be signing the death warrant for his political career.</p> <h2>From Rhodesia to the Mugabe years</h2> <p><strong>1922</strong> The British South Africa Company ends rule of Southern Rhodesia and white minority rule begins.</p> <p><strong>1963</strong> Central African Federation - S Rhodesia (Zimbabwe), N Rhodesia (Zambia) and Nyasaland (Malawi) - breaks up. </p> <p><strong>1965</strong> Rhodesia's Prime Minister Ian Smith declares independence.

  "<p>They call them the Bandi Guant\u00e1namo, the Guant\u00e1namo returnees, and their welcome home is far from warm. All across Afghanistan in recent months, scores of men have been coming back from a long journey halfway around the world. About 100 have been released from Guant\u00e1namo Bay by United States authorities in the last 12 months as Washington, under mounting pressure from governments around the world, attempts to moderate the damage done to America's image by the Cuba-based detention centre. A third are Afghan and more are due to return in the coming weeks.</p> <p>After more than five years in detention thousands of miles away, often traumatised, often angry, or just broken and poor, the Bandi Guant\u00e1namo try to build new lives, with limited success. Most claim innocence. Others are unashamed of their acts of violence. Interviewed in Kabul last month, Mohammed Umr described how he had trained in terrorist techniques, met Osama bin Laden and fought at the battle of Tora Bora in 2001. Released 10 weeks ago, he spoke of how angry the presence of his former jailers in his homeland made him. 'If they have come here to help us, why do they kill civilians and why can't they even provide electricity to Kabul seven years after invading?', asked the 30-year-old former footballer, arrested in Pakistan during the closing days of the war of 2001.</p> <p>Almost all the former detainees describe mistreatment - ranging from waterboarding - the repeated half-drowning of prisoners to get them to talk - through to beatings, sleep deprivation, being kept in 'stress positions' and exposure to extreme temperatures for long periods. Most say that the worst abuse occurred in US bases in Afghanistan, notably in the eastern and southern cities of Jalalabad and Kandahar, or at the logistics centre of Bagram airfield, where a 500-capacity makeshift prison was built. American military spokesmen in Afghanistan deny any mistreatment.</p> <p>By comparison, the former prisoners say, Guant\u00e1namo was relatively bearable. 'It was better there,' said Abdul Nasir, who added that he had been deprived of sleep in the Bagram prison. 'The food was OK. There was more exercise. When I arrived [in 2003] we had just 20 minutes twice a week. By the end it was two hours a day.' Like others interviewed by The Observer, Nasir, 26, claimed that rows frequently broke out in Guant\u00e1namo over religious practice. 'The guards made noise when we were praying. They shouted bad things,' he alleged. 'There was nearly a riot because they were handling the Koran that we were allowed in our cells.'</p> <p>Many former detainees say they have been told by the Afghan government or their former jailers not to talk to journalists. Several senior former Taliban figures, such as Mullah Abdul Salam Zaeef, their former ambassador to Pakistan, are under house arrest in Kabul, supposedly as part of the largely moribund 'reconciliation process'. The head of the reconciliation commission was in Canada and unable to comment, his office said.</p> <p>Mirwais Yasini, Deputy Speaker of the Afghan parliament, played down the danger of returnees joining Taliban insurgents in control of large parts of the south and east of the country. 'We should try to reintegrate them, but [the returnees] should not get any special treatment,' he said from his office in the new Afghan parliament building. 'Their story is that of Afghanistan: a tragic tale.'</p> <p>Many former detainees return to hardship, chaos and violence. In the six years he has been gone, Abdul Nasir's village on Kabul's outskirts has barely changed but for a new road and new insecurity. 'We are worried to go into the fields at night because the coalition think we are Taliban and shoot at us,' said Nasir's elder brother. 'Every week, the Taliban are firing at the police in the village. Our school was burnt down and there have been bomb attacks.'</p> <p>Nasir was arrested by Afghan troops in 2002, accused of attacking a border post with a group of Pakistani Taliban. Though he now denies the allegation, legal sources close to his case said he had confessed, claiming he had been press-ganged by fellow students at the religious school where he had been studying in the anarchic Pakistani tribal zones.</p> <p>Saeed Jan was freed two years ago. He says he does not know why he was arrested in 2002 and says he was repeatedly beaten after his arrest in the eastern Kunar province and again at Bagram by American personnel. He returned to his village to find his sick wife and mother had died and his 12-year-old son had been killed in a fall while collecting wood. 'When I got home I said to myself it would have been better to have stayed in detention,' he said. 'At least my village is peaceful, but I have four other children and no money. We are hungry and I cannot afford food.'</p> <p>The detainees are being released into Afghan custody after their cases are reviewed by US authorities. They are usually held in the new wing, built with American funds, at Pul-e-Sharqi prison near Kabul, where they are tried under Afghan law by local terrorist courts. Most are released and given about \u00a35 and some clothes. Many claim to have been the victims of denunciations by tribal enemies or rivals in complex local power struggles. It is difficult to confirm their stories, although many details appear convincing. In the aftermath of the invasion of 2001, with large bounties on offer for information leading to the arrest of al-Qaeda or Taliban supporters, coalition authorities with little knowledge of Afghanistan were often manipulated by factions and individuals to eliminate long-standing enemies. </p> <p>Haji Ghalib, a tribal elder from eastern Nangahar province released late last year, claimed he was falsely denounced after closing down a drugs bazaar when he was police chief in a rough district near Jalalabad. 'It was a ridiculous accusation, but the Americans believed it. They beat me, gave me no food and interrogated me by strapping me to a wooden plank and pushing my head into water. I kept telling them they had got the wrong person,' he said. </p> <p>Independent sources confirm that Ghalib, a former fighter against the Russians, had fought against the Taliban in previous years and was allied with an anti-Taliban warlord.</p> <p>'I spent four years in Guant\u00e1namo without any evidence of any guilt at all because I am innocent,' he said in Kabul. 'But I am not angry at the Americans because they were the victims of bad information. But I would like the money and vehicles they took from me. I am in a very difficult situation now, and I am worried about the people who accused me, because they could do it again.'</p> <p>More than 500 detainees have been released from Guant\u00e1namo and American authorities have indicated that only about 70 of the 263 still in their custody will be tried. They include at least a dozen senior al-Qaeda figures. A few hundred prisoners are still held in Bagram, where two have died of injuries sustained during interrogations.</p> <p>The detainees often return to tragedy and destitution. Saeed Ameer, from the eastern Nangahar province, was arrested in 2002 after explosives were found in his home. He denies all knowledge of the cache and blames a relative.

  "<h2>Virgo</h2> <p><strong>23 August -22 Septmeber</strong></p> <p>Tonight's Harvest Moon marks a minor climax in your affairs, no more than high jinks perhaps, though the larger cycle corresponds to how you conduct your one-on-one affairs. Whether it's a case of well met, or well rid, at this point you need enough personal space to reinvent yourself.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Amy Winehouse, 14 September 1983</p> <h2>Libra</h2> <p><strong>23 September-23 October</strong></p> <p>Falling prey to second thoughts may be part of Libra's lot, but it's inappropriate now. Exhibitions of determination and control are more the ticket under stars that allow you to make the changes you have long promised yourself. Call the shots as you see them. Hot dates are likewise best pursued swiftly. Prevaricate later.</p> <h2>Capricorn</h2> <p><strong>22 December-19 January</strong></p> <p>Contrary to some perceptions, you're not all about work and self-advancement, but it's hard to tear your attention from professional issues because last year's work is paying off or because hefty expenditure requires a weighty income. Plus, with Mercury about to turn awkward, if you're not already working flat out, speed up! </p> <h2>Aquarius</h2> <p><strong>20 January-19 February</strong></p> <p>Even if you're an outsider or rebel, it's the right time to make common cause, find your crowd (maybe a new one) and stretch your intellect into new areas of study and self-improvement. Professionally, a community of interest serves you better than being a solo act. Personal partnerships? Promising week for a surprise encounter. </p> <h2>Taurus</h2> <p><strong>20 April-20 May</strong></p> <p>If you're in the right line of work, all that's required to get a memorable result is to hold steady (your speciality). If you're bored silly with your job or fallen out with your employer, this autumn comes laden with opportunities to jump ship, even if you land in a line of work or place way off your agenda. A Taurean Moon on Thursday and Friday promises a peep into the future.</p> <h2>Gemini</h2> <p><strong>21 May-20 June</strong></p> <p>If you're looking for a little profile, whether at work or to win brownie points with the gang, a cluster of planets in the show-off zone of your 'scope hands you the chance. The same applies if you're more interested in attracting one particular crush, with Saturday splendidly starred. In either case showing off means cool confidence rather than simply making an exhibition of yourself.</p> <h2>Scorpio</h2> <p><strong>24 October-21 November</strong></p> <p>Today's full Moon has the makings of a wild weekend (it ain't over yet), or at least a time when you get to see just what a love affair or friendship is actually worth. Still, with emotional attachments very much in flux (or just in secret), put dramatic declarations on hold for a couple of weeks, when the tables are set to turn in your favour. Besides, your professional side is calling loudly - communicate!</p> <h2>Sagittarius</h2> <p><strong>22 November-21 December</strong></p> <p>Living life in public, whether it's through the job or some wider type of community service, means being under scrutiny, so make sure you walk it like you talk it, if you want your halo to remain in place. Colleagues, friends and fans are conveniently on hand to sail you through moments of doubt and difficulty; don't be a stranger. Single? Hot week for a spin round the dance floor, or round the block.</p> <h2>Pisces</h2> <p><strong>20 February-20 March</strong></p> <p>A full Moon in one's sign customarily gingers things up, so let's hope today's finds you in fascinating social interaction rather than uproar. The confrontational mood of your 'scope is there to bring clarity rather than peace in any struggles. Fight your turf, though your planet, Jupiter, suggests a well-trusted colleague or well-to-do other might help no end in your battles.</p> <h2>Aries</h2> <p><strong>21 March-19 April</strong></p> <p>It's difficult to have things all your way when Aries' planet, Mars, is in opposition (until October), but Tuesday and Wednesday give you an edge in discussions with eminent people who can lend a helping hand, or even employ you. You can also move things along with partners or crushes, though that means listening carefully, as well as telling them to hurry up! </p> <h2>Cancer</h2> <p><strong>21 June-22 July</strong></p> <p>Your sign has a reputation for mulling over the past, and with Mercury lurking at the root of your chart for several weeks yet, family and ancestral issues may require an airing. The opposite is true of work and close relationships, where you can sign off the last four months and blaze into the future. Money and partners, by the way, are strongly linked this autumn. </p> <h2>Leo</h2> <p><strong>23 July-22 August</strong></p> <p>One's working life can be an inconvenient necessity, but bear in mind that yours is beautifully starred this autumn - even if it doesn't put your name in lights. On a more personal, perhaps intimate, level, you have an unusual number of options to explore - even if that means compartmentalising your life. No-one needs to know everything you get up to.</p>",
  "<h2>Tackling crime doesn't 'crush our freedoms'</h2> <p>Henry Porter seems to think it illogical that our prisons are full while crime is falling ('Our obsession with crime is crushing our freedoms', Comment, last week). Maybe, if crime is falling, it is because criminals are being imprisoned, and so there are fewer at large to terrorise the rest of us?</p> <p>I do not feel my civil liberties are being eroded by virtue of jailing more murderers, violent thugs or other members of our lawless underclass. Every time a rapist is jailed, the streets are that little bit safer for women. For most people, I suspect, it is crime which is destroying their quality of life and communities, not the alleged erosion of civil liberties by measures to tackle that crime.<br><strong>Pete Dorey</strong><br>Reader in British Politics, Cardiff University</p> <p>I work as a police officer alongside probation and drugs workers trying to cut crime through the close supervision of offenders on licence. The criminal justice system is a massive industry that produces nothing but hot air and paperwork. If a proportion of this money could be put into creating work for some of these people and/or their families the benefits would be massive. </p> <p>The other point I would make is about officers spending time in police stations. Having spent 18 years in uniform I have found this unavoidable due to the fact that the British police, in my opinion, are good at detecting crime - hence the full prisons - but poor at prevention, with no one on the streets. <br><strong>Peter Gilbert</strong><br>Address supplied</p> <h2>Liberal press played fair on Palin</h2> <p>As in the case of the invasion of Iraq, Nick Cohen has bought into Republican talking points. In his column last week ('When Barack's berserkers lost the plot'), he castigates the 'liberal press' and 'liberal journalists' for attacking Sarah Palin's family background instead of her record. The only evidence supporting his argument is a brief reference to the New York Times. He is unable to offer other examples because, like the WMDs in Iraq, they do not exist. An anonymous posting on a left-wing blog did raise questions about the origins of Palin's baby, but this hardly constitutes an effort by the 'liberal press' to demonise her. Indeed, the Republican party spent all week pushing this line in an effort to discredit efforts by the very media Cohen derides to document Palin's real record.<br><strong>Steve Hewitt</strong><br>University of Birmingham</p> <h2>Contact breaker</h2> <p>One thing that is never mentioned regarding 'child access', or contact, ('Penalties for partners who block access', News, last week) is any form of redress when the absent parent - usually the father - has a contact arrangement but fails to keep to it. There is nothing more sad than a child waiting by the window for Daddy to turn up and he doesn't show. This can be a reason for the parent with care denying the absent parent contact, often reluctantly after months or years of upset and distress.<br><strong>Josette Morgan</strong><br>Potton, Bedfordshire</p> <h2>Another look at those crown duos</h2> <p>Intriguing to see that artists painted royalty to look like themselves, as we see from the examples in your article 'Why portraits look so like the artist' (News, last week).

We were purchased by a major American chemical company. Immediately, it was obvious the UK was now just another sales territory and major job losses followed.</p> <p>Some of us were left to soldier on and the UK footprint withered to next to nothing. Then, last year, we were informed that the company was to 're-engineer' its entire European operations. This meant moving the European headquarters to Switzerland to take advantage of its lower corporate taxes, with all of the European countries becoming glorified sales agents for the Swiss company. These local companies would be constructed in such a way that they would never make a profit; only Switzerland would do that.</p> <p>So now in the UK the company benefits from employing a highly trained work force that was educated at the UK state's expense. When those workers are sick they are returned to work quickly by an efficient NHS, paid for by taxes. They drive their goods to their customers on roads paid for by taxes. </p> <p>And what do they contribute? Nothing. I tried to argue this with a faceless HR suit sent to try to indoctrinate us.

It may not be illegal, but it is certainly immoral. <br><strong>Name and address supplied</strong></p> <h2>Labour's bear-baiter</h2> <p>Disturbingly, it is no shock to me that Labour would consider using bear- baiting Kyle with his one dimensional 'morality' ('Labour bid to work with Jeremy Kyle', News, last week).

The piece goes on to say 'many' of the women have postponed having children, but does not specify whether this is directly career-related, or for myriad other reasons.</p> <p>I passionately believe there need to be opportunities for women in any business sector to achieve their full career potential, whether or not they also choose to have children.

  "<p>Paul Gladstone Reid is something of a rarity in classical music. At 17 he founded a 15-piece jazz touring orchestra. At 25 he composed a string quartet. Before he hit 30 his work was being performed by the Royal Philharmonic, and last year he was awarded the MBE for services to music. He is one of the UK's most promising musical talents, but there is another reason why he is exceptional: Gladstone Reid is black. </p> <p>In the historically rarefied world of classical music, this makes him an anomaly. Ethnic minorities account for almost 10 per cent of Britain's population and yet the vast majority of our music colleges, string quartets and orchestras remain overwhelmingly white. </p> <p>Born in Jamaica and raised by a Seventh Day Adventist family in Sheffield, Gladstone Reid is one of the very few black musicians who has made it to the top. 'A lot of black people went to music college and enjoyed it but there is a clear race issue when it comes to employment at the end of that,' he says. 'There's a sense [among conductors] of: \"Why would I want one black spot in the orchestra? It spoils the view\".</p> <p>'People don't admit it but we all know racism is there. A friend of mine was the [black] principal cellist for the National Youth Orchestra. Normally you'd expect someone like that to walk into a job. He hadn't got a single interview in a year. There's a wall of silence.'</p> <p>Are our orchestras diverse enough? A cursory look at the figures reveals that they are certainly not representative of our multicultural society. The BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra is comprised of 76 core musicians, all of whom are white. Of the 63 members who make up the Ulster Orchestra, 62 are white and one is Asian. The Hall\u00e9 Orchestra in Manchester fares little better: out of 86 musicians, they employ one black Caribbean performer, one Chinese member and 14 white non-British nationals.</p> <p>Edmund Reid, now the leader of the Opera de Baug\u00e9 orchestra in north-west France, was born in Jamaica and came to Britain at 16 on a musical scholarship. For many years he found he was the only black musician in the orchestras he worked for, and when he auditioned for Sir Georg Solti at the Royal Opera House in 1964 it took two months for the committee to discuss 'whether it was OK to employ a black man'. 'I've had a pretty rocky time,' he says. 'When I started I told myself I wouldn't get in an orchestra if I played as well as the next person, so I decided I had to be 300 per cent better.'</p> <p>In 1987 Reid successfully took his then-employers, the English National Opera, to an industrial tribunal after they refused to give him the title of co-leader, despite acting as lead violin for two years. </p> <p>But statistics and individual experiences alone do not prove an endemic racism within the classical music community. Many orchestral auditions are undertaken 'blind', with musicians performing behind a screen, and all UK orchestras operate on an equal opportunities basis. Although there might, as in any walk of life, be the odd racist polluting the waters, the racial conformity of our orchestras points to a lack of non-white players coming up through the system.</p> <p>David Lammy, the black Labour MP for Tottenham and former Culture Minister, insists that the issue goes beyond race boundaries. To see it as a black and white issue oversimplifies a far more complex problem. According to Lammy, the ethnic composition of our orchestras is more a question of class and social deprivation.</p> <p>'The problem is that the model of taking your instrument home and practising every day for an hour doesn't apply to inner city environments; it doesn't apply to a lot of communities, it's not just black communities. For my constituents, the idea they can take an instrument home to their council estate, to a house they share with many brothers and sisters, and practise on their own without the support of their parents, is just implausible.'</p> <p>For parents to encourage the level of dedication required to reach the top echelons of orchestral performance, says Lammy, they must first be familiar with a classical music tradition that is rooted in a white, Christian historical context. Gladstone Reid was fortunate that his great-grandfather was an Anglican choirmaster and his father taught him how to play the guitar from the age of seven. Lammy, too, was exposed to classical music as a cathedral chorister. But for many young musicians there is no such frame of reference.</p> <p>Outside Britain there are successful grassroots models for getting underprivileged youths into music, often with transformative results. At 13 Lennar Acosta was living on the streets in his native Venezuela with a crack habit and a .38 calibre gun. At 15 he was in a young offenders' institute in Caracas, surrounded by other delinquents who, just like him, had been abandoned by their families and mainstream society. Then, he was given a clarinet and his life started to change. 'I didn't know what it was,' he recalled, several years later. 'I was fascinated when I saw it.'</p> <p>Acosta is an alumnus of El Sistema Youth Orchestras Project, a visionary project founded 33 years ago by the economist Jose Abreu. It provides free music tuition for disadvantaged children, and so far over 270,000 children have benefited. For Acosta, the results were indelible: 'Music saved my life. It helped me let out a lot of the anger inside.' </p> <p>Britain, says Lammy, has much to learn from the Venezuelan model: 'It's about group practice, it's as much about childcare and community as it is about music. We need to be a lot more imaginative about what classical music can offer.'</p> <p>Part of the problem in the UK stems from a chronic underfunding of school music education. The Thatcher government of the 1980s capped spending on schools in an attempt to keep the lid on council tax rises. Music lessons and after-school orchestras fell by the wayside. 'It's a failure of general education,' says Norman Lebrecht, a Radio 3 presenter. 'Over the past 30 years we've reduced the cultural exposure of children. It's been an educational dereliction and you have to nail it to the lapels of the politicians.'</p> <p>Some efforts are being made to rectify the imbalance. The City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, for instance, currently has 28,000 young people from diverse backgrounds in its education programmes. Yet all of this may miss the point; perhaps young musicians from ethnic minorities simply do not want to follow the restrictive classical route. 'Culturally, classical music is of Western origin,' says Haylie Ecker, the first violinist for the multi-million selling classical crossover group Bond. 'Some of the best musicians in history are black, but they express themselves in the forms of jazz, soul, hip-hop and pop.' Still, if a promising black musician decides against a career in classical music, it should, ideally, be a question of choice, not necessity.</p> <h2>Chi-Chi Nwanoku, MBE</h2> <p><strong>Double bassist, founder member and principal double bassist of the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment and fellow of the Royal Academy of Music </strong></p> <p>I got into music without even knowing it was classical. I was round at a schoolfriend's and heard her older brother playing 12-bar blues. I was seven and I wouldn't leave the room because I was transfixed. I stood there until he taught me how to play it, and every day I'd go back just to get my hands on that piano. My parents offered to scrape everything together for piano lessons and in about two weeks I could read music - I just got it. In my last year of school my teachers advised me to take up an unpopular orchestral instrument. So I took up the double bass and went to learn it at Cambridge Tech. I then went on to the Royal Academy of Music. I was encouraged to go out and seize the world and not give a thought to race. The only kind of race I was into was to be a 100-metre sprinter. Generally we must find a method to convince young people there are better ways to feel proud of themselves. Music is one of them - it is a natural bridge between the beat of a heart and the beat on the street.</p> <h2>Althea Ifeka</h2> <p><strong>Oboist, won third prize at the Paris International Interpretation competition last year. Her debut CD, From Leipzig to London, was released in 2006</strong></p> <p>What I have to say is probably very un-PC, but I'm going to say it anyway. The lack of black orchestral musicians is about money, not colour. It's a bad career choice. Norman Lebrecht has explored this very well. As a soloist and conductor you can earn a lot but orchestral musicians face many years of training followed by pitiful pay. I work mainly as a soloist and teach now but I did have a big orchestral career in the past. I have lots of African and Asian children in my teaching practice. First-generation immigrants don't want their children going into a profession that is uncertain and poorly rewarded. </p> <p>Like Chi-Chi Nwanoku I'm mixed race, and I owe my career to my white upbringing. If I had been brought up in Nigeria with my dad, I wouldn't be where I am today. In Africa classical music is nowhere. There are class issues because classical music is seen as a middle-class, upper-class pursuit. Middle-class Africans are buying into the idea of classical music, so we will see a change in the next 25 years. In my opinion, classical music is the highest art form, and you can't keep it down. There are working-class people in Britain's orchestras. It's traditional that lots of our brass sections come from the north and straight from colliery bands. Not everybody is privately educated in British orchestras; there is a range. </p> <p>I'm not sure why there are more Japanese and Chinese classical musicians. I know there has been a huge explosion in classical music in China I don't think there is an accessibility problem here; the orchestras are bending over backwards to be open and accessible. They have big educational budgets and the ticket prices are ridiculously cheap. Paying \u00a36 at the Royal Festival Hall is nothing when you consider the quality of what you are getting in return and how much that product cost to be realised.</p> <p>I have never experienced racial prejudice in an orchestra. They might be surprised to see me, but soon get used to me. I partly grew up in Australia and I faced so much racial discrimination there, so I know what racial discrimination is and I've never experienced it in this profession. It is a meritocracy. The idea of quotas is offensive to me, and social engineering the make-up of orchestras would be unacceptable. </p> <p>When I have applied for teaching jobs at public schools I definitely got the impression that my face didn't fit. They express concern that my performing career is too successful and might distract from the job, or rule me out because I can't play the piano, yet I've been to Cambridge and the Royal Academy of Music and I'm a Fulbright scholar.</p> <h2>David Kadumukasa</h2> <p><strong>30, cellist, graduated from the Royal College of Music in 2002</strong></p> <p>Both my parents are African first-generation immigrants. I'm the first in the family to play a musical instrument. I started playing cello when I was six after seeing a demonstration class in school.</p> <p>The orchestral scene is very specific and competitive. In some respects it's not a big deal that there aren't black and Indian Asian players in those orchestras because there are many, many people trying to get into the main orchestras. </p> <p>The lack of black and Indian Asian classical musicians generally stems back to who is learning at a young age. I think that's all changing. Many more people within these communities are taking up an instrument. In the past maybe parents of first-generation immigrants were determined that their children go into the more traditional professions where an income would be guaranteed. Now that an immigrant middle class is establishing itself people have a bit more freedom to go into a career in something like music. </p> <p>I went to a public school. There is a massive difference in music education in state and public schools. There are some state schools that really push music but I think in the main it is still the preserve of private schools. Music is perhaps more valued in public schools than in state schools in general. It's a very expensive thing to study. Lessons alone cost a lot of money, let alone buying an instrument. </p> <p>You still get the odd comment. People will say: 'There are not very many black cellists around.' I wouldn't say I've ever felt discrimination. Not so much now, but it has felt a little uncomfortable being the only black person in an orchestra or ensemble. I don't want to sound like I'm some revolutionary leader of black people in classical music but more people follow in your footsteps if you keep going in those situations.</p> <p>I would be totally against any kind of quota system. But I think orchestras have got a responsibility to look across the board for players and to involve themselves in projects that will introduce classical music to people outside their traditional audiences. </p> <h2>Uchenna Ngwe</h2> <p><strong>28, oboist, graduated from Trinity College of Music with a postgraduate diploma in 2004</strong></p> <p>I was born in Britain and both my parents are from Nigeria. Neither are musicians. In primary school I played some piano, then tried violin and later on oboe. At Hornsey School for Girls I started playing cello.</p> <p>My parents always encouraged us to do things we enjoyed. My mum does worry about the fact that, as a musician, unless you make it to the big time you're never going to earn that much money. She thought I was going to take up teaching so that I had some kind of steady income, which I did for about four years. Now I work with the national singing programme in schools as well as freelancing as a musician.</p> <p>There are lots of black and ethnic minority classical musicians freelancing - they just don't seem to be permanently based in orchestras. I like to play a wide range of music, so maybe other black and ethnic minority classical musicians feel that, like me, they don't want to be based in one style of music.</p> <p>I think it's important that young black and ethnic minorities can see role models in orchestras but I wouldn't encourage positive discrimination because it should be about talent. I got into music because I was encouraged by teachers and parents. It had nothing to do with having role models around me who looked like me.</p> <p>A lot of it is to do with financial situations - the cost of tuition and instruments, rather than race. It's very expensive playing a musical instrument to a high level. Your parents need to be willing and able to make sacrifices for that, or you need to have the money ready and available.</p> <p>I think it's more of an issue for people of a certain generation. If you look at black and ethnic minority students coming out of music college now, there's much more of a balance across the instruments rather than just everyone being singers and pianists.</p> <h2>Thanihan Jeyapalan</h2> <p><strong>19, first-year bassoon student at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama </strong></p> <p>I was born in Britain but my parents are Sri Lankan. I started playing cello at the age of 10, then I learnt piano, then trumpet, then bassoon. I did feel unusual because none of my friends or family were into classical music, but I was really musical, even as a baby. </p> <p>Lack of black and Indian classical musicians is partly a cultural problem. My parents couldn't imagine music as a career option so when I applied to GSMD I also applied to study medicine. I'm often the only black person in an orchestra when I play. </p> <p>I think the accessibility of orchestras is a big problem. Getting schools to visit orchestras is vital, as is cheaper ticket prices. I think the orchestras need to do a lot more to reach out. I want to play in the big orchestras so badly. It doesn't put me off that they are so white, it makes me even more determined.</p> <p><strong>Interviews by Katie Toms and Hermione Hoby</strong></p>",

There are fears that the Southampton plant, employing 1,100 workers, will be closed if Ford decides to build a new model of the van at its low-cost sites in Turkey or Romania. A decision on where to build the new model is due soon.</p> <p>Tomorrow union leaders will also meet executives from General Motors over its plans for a 'down day' on 26 September when its Vauxhall Vivaro van plant in Luton will cease production. </p> <p>Last month it emerged that Toyota was cutting production at its Derbyshire plant because of a fall in demand for cars. Unite also reports that Jaguar Land Rover - owned by the Indian firm Tata - is scaling back operations.</p> <p>Several housebuilders have announced big job losses as they struggle to sell new properties in the tough housing market. Barratt announced that it would cut a quarter of its workforce, and Persimmon said it would lay off 2,000 staff. In total, up to 50,000 construction workers have lost their jobs. On the broader measure favoured by the government, unemployment had already risen by 60,000 between March and June to 1.7 million. Michael Saunders, chief UK economist at Citigroup, believes the figure will continue rising for another two years, as the economy slides into recession, peaking by late 2010 at 2.25 million. </p> <p>'The only parts of the economy that have created many jobs over the past few years have been banking, finance and business services, and the public sector, and both of those look like they're going to get much weaker,' he said.</p> <p>But economists believe it will take until at least the end of next year before a sense of optimism begins to return. In the meantime Britain's consumers are expected to tighten their belts as the value of their homes declines and their spending power is eroded by rising food and fuel bills. That's bad for business on the high street and across service industries, and is expected to fuel unemployment. After the travel firm XL collapsed last week, British Airways boss Willie Walsh predicted that up to 30 small airlines could go out of business. </p> <p>Estate agents, too, have been hit hard. In a survey by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, some agents said they were selling just one property a week: hardly enough to justify employing a large staff. Halifax has announced that it is closing 53 branches, with the loss of up to 100 jobs. Analysts at Merrill Lynch have suggested that a third of all estate agents' branches could close. </p> <p>Hugo Sellert, head of research at online recruitment firm Monster, has noticed a decline in the number of new jobs being advertised. 'This month what emerged most clearly was that employers seemed to be scaling back on casual and temporary recruitment,' he said. He said the most noticeable weakening of the job market had been in East Anglia, the Midlands and London. 'Unemployment typically lags other indicators of the health of the economy, and we're looking at the early stages of the downturn,' he said, adding that the UK is six to nine months behind the US, where unemployment has risen sharply to 6.1 per cent, the highest rate in five years.</p> <p>Driving unemployment to a historic low was one of the proudest boasts of Gordon Brown's decade-long chancellorship and a key element of restoring Labour's record for economic competence.</p> <p>During the 1979 election campaign, Conservative campaign posters bearing the slogan 'Labour Isn't Working,' helped to dislodge the Callaghan government. But over the next four years Margaret Thatcher oversaw more than a doubling in unemployment, which shot up above three million in 1983. It hit three million again a decade later, during the painful recession of the early 1990s.</p> <p>Lai Wah Co, head of economic analysis at the the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), which represents businesses, said it should also help that UK plc is now leaner than it was at the outset of the last recession. 'Because of globalisation, companies have outsourced most offshore functions. There is not much scope for cutting back jobs. We don't think job losses will total those of the early Nineties.'</p> <p>The recent influx of migrant workers to the UK - many of whom are now going home - should also cushion the impact of falling employment. Since 2004, when eight eastern European countries joined the EU, about 845,000 migrant workers were attracted to the UK by the thriving job market. Approximately half have returned and more are following.</p> <p>However, because the days of mass unemployment are a distant memory to much of today's workforce, many employees have built up little in the way of a financial safety net, leaving them extremely vulnerable if they do lose their job. 'Over the past 10 years, people have never had this feeling of fear,' said a spokeswoman for Citizens' Advice, which says unemployment is one of the major causes of financial distress. The spokeswoman said: 'It [unemployment] doesn't hit for a while; they often borrow more to pay for basic things, so they get themselves deeper into debt.' </p> <p>As part of the government's housing package this month, Alistair Darling, the Chancellor, announced that people who lost their jobs would be able to claim financial support to help with mortgage interest payments after 13 weeks, instead of 39 weeks as at present. The Treasury is keen to prevent job losses leading to a wave of repossessions and forced sales in the housing market, driving prices lower in a vicious circle.</p> <p>Professor David Blanchflower, the US-based economist who sits on the Bank of England's interest rate-setting committee, told MPs last week he thought two million people could already be out of work by Christmas. He has repeatedly voted for further cuts in interest rates to prevent the downturn from spiralling out of control; but has been outgunned by the majority on the committee, which has left rates on hold since April.</p> <h2>Case study</h2> <p>For Gary, 40, losing his IT job at a leading bank in the City four months ago could not have come at a worse time. 'I was made redundant a week before my baby was born,' he said. 'I'd just moved into a new department and then the funding was withdrawn. I was escorted off the premises. It wasn't pleasant.' While he has enjoyed being around to help look after his first child, he is concerned about getting a new job. 'I don't think it's going to be easy. My concern is how long it's going to take.' His situation is more urgent because with his wife on maternity leave, the money coming into the home has fallen sharply. 'I have been in banking for 13 years and this is the biggest downturn. The question is how long will it take to recover?'</p>",
  "<p>The Scottish Labour party has elected Iain Gray as its new leader, making him the fifth person to take on the role in the eight years since devolution.</p> <p>The former Scottish enterprise minister beat rivals Cathy Jamieson and Andy Kerr in the contest that was triggered by the resignation of Wendy Alexander last June. The former leader stepped down after being found guilty of breaking Holyrood rules on declaring donations to her leadership campaign.</p> <p>Gray said the party, which lost control of the Scottish Parliament last year, was going through a difficult time. 'This election is the beginning of a new conviction in Scottish Labour, united around our shared values and moving forward with common purpose,' he said. 'Labour is best when we look outwards and align our values with the people's aspirations. </p> <p>'It is time to close the manifesto on which we fought the 2007 Scottish election and time to write our programme for Scotland for 2011 and beyond,' said Gray, who also used the occasion to launch a savage attack on SNP First Minister Alex Salmond.</p> <p>'When Alex Salmond was an official in the Scottish Office I was learning to be a teacher in a tough school and was a community activist in the biggest council housing scheme in Edinburgh,' Gray told an audience of about 70 activists yesterday.</p> <p>'While he moved to the Royal Bank of Scotland, I moved to Mozambique where I taught for two years in a country fighting for its life. While he spent the Eighties and Nineties developing the tricks of politics in Westminster, I spent them developing my values working for Oxfam,' said Gray, MSP for East Lothian.'</p> <p>Gray, 51, beat Jamieson, a former justice minister, who served as deputy Scottish leader for seven years, by 58 per cent to 42 per cent. Kerr, a former health minister, was eliminated after a first count in which no candidate achieved 50 per cent and the second preference votes of his supporters were then redistributed.</p> <p>The result of the contest was announced at Labour's Glasgow headquarters at noon yesterday. MSP Johann Lamont was declared deputy leader.</p> <p>Gray, who has been criticised in the past for his low-key approach to politics, immediately announced his intentions to rally the party and oppose the nationalist government head-on.</p> <p>But he faces a tough job. Gordon Brown and his party are suffering from dismal ratings north of the border and are currently fighting a difficult byelection in Glenrothes, following the death of Labour MP John MacDougall.</p> <p>Gray won the leadership contest despite only returning to Holyrood in the 2007 election after losing his Edinburgh Pentlands seat to the Tories' David McLetchie in 2003.</p> <p>'The challenge for the new leader of the Scottish Labour Party is threefold,' said John Curtis, Professor of Politics at Strathclyde University. 'First, can he match Alex Salmond sufficiently to catch the public's attention and puncture the balloon? The second problem is longer term. Irrespective of how popular Labour is in Westminster, it is always less popular in Holyrood elections because voters are looking for the party who will do the best thing for Scotland, rather than for the UK as a whole. When voters apply that criteria, the SNP tends to do better.'</p> <p>'However, the more pressing problem, and it's one which would have been the same for any of the leadership contenders, is does he have the charisma or the force of personality to match Salmond or inspire the troops?' said Curtis.</p> <p>'I don't want to be unkind but, to some degree, Gray by name and grey by nature.'</p> <p>In a YouGov poll on who would make the best First Minister carried out just two weeks ago, Gray was the least popular, scoring only 3 per cent of the vote. Seen by many as Gordon Brown's favourite for the position, Gray's first challenge will be the Glenrothes by-election.</p>",

  "<p><strong>What she watched:</strong></p> <p><strong>The Us Open Tennis Final, Sky Sports 1</strong></p> <p><strong>Maestro, BBC2</strong></p> <p><strong>Cern Sky News, BBC News</strong></p> <p><strong>The 9/11 Faker, C4</strong></p> <p>It has been a week of in-the-moment anti-climaxes. My heart sank when Andy Murray walked into the Arthur Ashe Stadium for his first Grand Slam final at the <strong>US Open</strong> (Sky Sports One) in that baggy grey top, crumpled shorts, fussy shoes and fuzzy-felt face, comforter-cum-cap crammed down over his screwed-up eyes. In stark contrast to dapper Roger Federer (fetching red shirt and grey shorts combo, spick'n'span white shoes), who looked like a Mattel action figure, Murray resembled a rainy Monday morning in Dunblane. </p> <p>I was stupidly distracted by Federer's outfit, though it took me the whole match to work out why. By the final game Murray was sweat-drenched while Roger remained immaculately fresh and dry - apart from his arms, which were soaking. Lord alone knows what sort of smart fabric his outfit is made from but, like Roger himself, it's clearly at the very cutting edge of sports technology. Never mind that Murray was at a major disadvantage, having played for three consecutive days; I fear that these small details matter more than we'd like them to.</p> <p>It's a strange one, the US Open. The Arthur Ashe is vast, seats 24,000 and has the acoustics of an indoor arena, and, because Americans are not as reverential as we are about their major sporting events, people were arriving halfway through the first set, ambling about against a background hum of chat. Personally, I'd like my Grand Slam finals to be played inside cathedrals, accessorised by candles and 'Zadok the Priest', but at the US Open you get - Woooooo! Yeah! - the Who turned up to 11.</p> <p>'I don't think it's the magnitude of the occasion that's causing Murray the biggest problems, it's the greatness of the man he's facing,' said Mark Petchey after Federer took the first set, but it couldn't have helped when Murray received a couple of terrible calls against him at a point in the second set when something miraculous still seemed conceivable. There was an air of inevitability about it all, however: how does a man go head-to-head with a Power Ranger when he looks like Ben 10?</p> <p>I loved the gaucheness of the presentation, the announcements about the size of the cheques and the handing over of a set of Lexus keys to Federer, who always looks faintly embarrassed by this kind of thing but was probably just thinking, 'Whatever - another car I won't have time to drive.' So while the result may have been the least surprising thing about the US Open Final, easily the most surprising thing was the sight of the US Vogue editrix, Anna Wintour (cocktail frock, little cardigan, obligatory shades and helmet bob) sitting in the second row. I shouldn't think Wintour has been in the second row of a show, catwalk or otherwise, since about 1978. </p> <p>The second live anti-climax of the week came on Tuesday: I was pumped up for the <strong>Maestro</strong> final (BBC2), rooting for Goldie, whose conducting performances had, with the exception of the Mozart, been glorious, emotional, uplifting, energising and revelatory. In his showdown with the prissy Jane Asher and perky Sue Perkins, I thought it was a no-brainer. Goldie won on the judges' vote, with Sue in second place, which left the two of them to battle it out with the assistance, or otherwise, of Beethoven's Fifth before the phone lines opened. </p> <p>By the end, even though I appreciated Perkins's skill, I still thought Goldie had it in the bag (I voted four times) on the grounds that, quite aside from conducting from memory without a score, he conveyed something indefinably special that managed to cross the glass wall between us. </p> <p>'You are a conductor,' said judge Sir Roger Norrington for the second time in the series. Foregone conclusion, surely? But no, Perkins won. Momentarily, I had dark thoughts about the voting, but pulled myself together. I suspect a lot of people who know a great deal more about conducting classical music than I do (which would be nearly everybody) were also voting and that therefore, technically, the undeniably musically gifted winner deserved her Maestro title. But I hope Goldie keeps his hand(s) in, as it were - I'd love to see him let loose on some funky Bach.</p> <p>Sport, the arts... on Wednesday it was science's turn to put the latter into some sort of super-lightweight parallel perspective by allowing cameras to watch middle-aged men in smart-casualwear sitting around sending texts while they waited to switch on a gigantic machine that has the capacity to make worm food of us all. Maybe.</p> <p>I have been completely obsessed by the existence of <strong>Cern</strong> for years. Indeed Switzerland, for me, is not about skiing, watches or excellent banking facilities for Eurolottery winners and Russian oligarchs, it is all about a 27km underground tunnel in which genuinely magical and mysterious things occur. How typically Swiss it is of the Swiss, then, to hide their greatest light under the proverbial bushel - I'm sure even as I write the Americans are planning to build their own Large Hadron Collider with an attached theme park incorporating a thrilling rollercoaster called the Big Boson. </p> <p>I watched Sky News and News 24 and marvelled at how unprepared the Cern team appeared to be for the demands of 24/7 rolling news coverage. At Sky, brave attempts by studio-based presenter Dermot Murnaghan and on-the-spot reporter Orla Chennaoui to spice up the switch-flicking with interesting factoids, cutaways to project boss Lyn Evans's press conferences in French, albeit with a distinct Welshness that made for a kind of strangled Wanglais, and shots of unfathomable things happening on flickering computer screens did not riveting TV make.</p> <p>'This is my generation's moon-landing,' a viewer texted BBC News - which was a perfect soundbite but wouldn't have stood up to scrutiny under a magnifying glass, never mind an electron microscope. I remember the moon landing vividly and it differed from this experiment mostly by being fabulously visual. That one small step didn't actually explain the meaning of life, of course, but it kind of looked as though it might, simply because it was so grandiose. But the meaning of life appears to have a suitably Swiss sort of mind-set, keeping itself to itself, getting on with things quietly, not looking for too much attention... </p> <p>Even though the switching on of a machine which will, in due course, quite likely reveal how we came to be was always going to be more of a symbolic journey for viewers, I do think Cern could have made a tiny bit more of an effort to get with the programme. Hell, they could have had their switch flicked by the most famous Swiss man in the world, fresh from his historic fifth consecutive US Open triumph (which proves he's probably not made of the same particles as the rest of us), especially as Roger was probably just down the road, twiddling his thumbs and footling about with his Lexus. </p> <p>Anyway, I'd been a bit dim about the experiment. I'd thought they'd switch the Collider on, let it warm up for a while like an old radiogram, then start hurling atoms at each other before teatime and reveal the existence or otherwise of Higgs boson on the 10 o'clock news... but I suppose if you wait a billion years to discover the meaning of life, what's another few weeks, eh?</p> <p>I watched <strong>The 9/11 Faker</strong> (C4) wondering, aghast, how a person who lives a lie day after day - one which consumes them even as it presumably somehow validates them - is living any sort of a meaningful life? 'Tania Head' - who pretended to be a survivor of 9/11 - and not just any random got-a-bit-lucky survivor, but one with a near-miraculous story ('She had all the key elements of everybody else's story. The perfect story,' said genuine survivor Barbara Conrad), must presumably have got to a place where she believed her lie to be her own truth. </p> <p>While we are all the stars of our own little movie, Tania made hers a blockbuster: a heroic tale of being burned by jet fuel and saved by a young man, Welles Crowther (a genuine posthumous hero, subsequently made an honorary member of the New York City Fire Department), even as her fianc\u00e9 was dying in the other tower. </p> <p>Ironically, Tania (aka Spaniard Alicia Esteve Head) did a great deal of good for the survivors of 9/11, ending up as the president of the World Trade Centre Survivors' Network, but, in uniquely 21st-century fashion, she was eventually stripped bare by her own celebrity when her emotional fraud (it's not technically a crime, just feels like one) was exposed by the New York Times. Nobody knows the whereabouts of Tania/Alicia, though one gets the feeling that reports of her alleged suicide may be greatly exaggerated.</p> <h2>When Piers met Pam</h2> <p>BBC1's portentously titled <strong>The Dark Side of Fame with Piers Morgan </strong>(there's a light side to fame with Piers Morgan?), saw the host meeting Pamela Anderson - as smart a cookie that ever made a bunch of rubbish decisions as you'll find.</p> <p>Despite abysmal taste in men (notably Tommy Lee: 'Even though you say you'll never do that, I married my father...' while lying on a sun-lounger in a bikini with a cocktail) plus a career in which the tide turned a decade ago, long after she became famous for running down beaches in slo-mo wearing the most iconic one-piece in swimwear history, Pammy proved to be intensely likeable and sanguine. </p> <p>However, she clearly has people-pleasing issues, cheerfully hopping on to the presenter's trembling knee for the money shot, during which Morgan looked as though he would faint with joy. It's unlikely Jim Davidson will get the same treatment this week.</p>",
  "<p>VS Naipaul - soft-focused on the cover of this book as a thrusting young Trinidadian gun, late of Oxford and the BBC - is now well on his way to carving out a reputation as the grumpy old man of English letters. Ostensibly prompted by a writerly desire to set out formative influences on his 'ways of seeing', A Writer's People soon climbs to the familiar Naipaul tone of regretful pusillanimity, the snarkiness of the elder literary statesman. Between boasting of unworldliness ('I didn't understand [The Quiet American] partly because I didn't read the newspapers') and bidding for the pantheon, Naipaul gives an idea of the sort of writers he likes (male, dead) and the sort that disappoint him (former friends). When Naipaul turns on the enthusiasm, he is a perceptive critic; but too often he seems to have his eyes shut.</p>",
  "<p>If belief is the big issue at Arsenal these days then a result like this nourishes the faithful. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger often likes to remind us that Arsenal get the wrong kind of kicks up north; victories are far harder to come by. The FA Cup, European Cup and 14 precious league points all went astray upland of Birmingham last season, but there was no northern exposure here.</p> <p>With Theo Walcott once more to the fore, Arsenal caressed their way through a defence as welcoming as the Blackburn weather, scoring twice before the break to convert the game's remainder to a training exercise. It culminated with Emmanuel Adebayor completing his hat-trick off the telling reverse pass of another young tyro, Aaron Ramsey. 'Very pleasing,' said Wenger. 'We started very late with our training because we had many players at the European Championship, but we are growing now.'</p> <p>Losing four goals for the second straight League match was down to 'suicidal defending', according to Paul Ince. 'I was tempted to bring myself on. Conceding eight goals in two games is not good - even though we are creating chances, we need to tighten up a bit.'</p> <p>With Samir Nasri injured on international duty and word swirling around that Tomas Rosicky's recovery from hamstring surgery had developed into a knee problem, Arsenal's team selection had been forced. The rest that Wenger had pondered granting Walcott evaporated as England's Croat killer was posted to the left wing.</p> <p>'Watch all our games now and see the first tackle on Theo,' warned Wenger after last Wednesday's heroics - if the intention was to intimidate the teenager's marker, it worked. Jay Simpson stood off his challenge the first two occasions Walcott came close; by the third, the right back and two team-mates were clutching air as Walcott created the opener.</p> <p>Breaking from that knot of markers, Walcott ran parallel with the 18-yard area, drew one more opponent towards him, then picked out Robin van Persie's run into the area. The Dutchman's first touch dragged Paul Robinson from his line and his second dragged the ball across him.</p> <p>Too much time prevented Arsenal from adding a second before the quarter-hour mark. A Blackburn corner degenerated into a three-on-one counterattack, with Walcott free on the left as Adebayor lolloped onwards. A simple pass set him up on his preferred right foot. The body shape was that of Thierry Henry bending the ball into the far corner. The end product was high, wide and ugly.</p> <p>Still more unsightly were the tackles Keith Andrews felt fit to inflict upon opponents in his first Premier League start. Straight from his former environment of League One, only Mike Dean's tolerance allowed the birthday boy to escape crude challenges on Van Persie and Cesc F\u00e1bregas without the yellow card each deserved.</p> <p>Consistently creative, Arsenal should again have extended their lead before a carousel of passes culminated with Adebayor's back-post header from a Denilson centre to make it 2-0.</p> <p>Until this point, there had been more to Blackburn than their scrappy defending, with enough chances created to have been on level terms. Roque Santa Cruz headed one Brett Emerton centre on to William Gallas's scalp, another wide and a third over. Emerton just failed to convert an Andrews cross; and the latter soon returned the favour. Santa Cruz miscued in front of Manuel Almunia, and when the goalkeeper was finally tested he proved equal to Brett Emerton's strike.</p> <p>Returned to the right to start the second half, Walcott soon skipped past Ryan Nelsen and into familiar penalty-area position. That Zagreb daisycutter, though, escaped him, allowing a man with less pleasant memories of Croatia to save.</p> <p>Arsenal were now in complete control, Wenger finally able to withdraw Walcott as his team comfortably shuffled possession between them. With 10 minutes remaining, Emmanuel Ebou\u00e9 won a penalty as Stephen Warnock left two legs to be tripped over at the cost of an injury that might keep Ebou\u00e9 out of Wednesday's Champions League tie. Adebayor converted emphatically, then took on Ramsey's fine pass to make it four. By then Wenger had added Jack Wilshere - at 16 years and 256 days, their youngest ever League footballer. 'I bring them out slowly, these English players,' smiled Wenger. 'He's another one who will soon play for you.'</p> <p><strong>THE FANS' PLAYER RATINGS AND VERDICT</strong></p> <p><strong>Paul McGarry, Observer reader</strong></p> <p>The game turned on their second goal. The first half had been fairly even - we had four or five excellent chances that we didn't take, they had two that they did. After that the second half was a non-event and like the previous game we let in two goals late on from poor defending. The result didn't really reflect the game, but it's exposed broader issues about how Ince has got us set up - we play a lot more openly than under Hughes, which can pay dividends, but the flipside is we look more vulnerable when we haven't got the ball. There are some positives, though - despite conceding four Robinson is doing OK, Reid is looking good in central midfield and Santa Cruz and Roberts caused Arsenal problems in the first half.<br><strong><br>The fan's player ratings</strong> Robinson 6; Simpson 6 (Derbyshire 5), Samba 5, Nelsen 6, Warnock 4; Emerton 6, Andrews 5, Reid 6, Pedersen 6 (Treacy 5); Santa Cruz 6, Roberts 6 (McCarthy 4)</p> <p><strong>Jeff Cronkshaw, Observer reader</strong></p> <p>An easy day, really. The first 20 minutes were fairly calm and we just got better and better. Adebayor's hat-trick was overdue and well deserved. His third in particular was fantastic. We weren't pressured at all and the penalty was just waiting to happen. Walcott oozed confidence - he's a different player now from the start of the season. His passing is much more fluent, more confident. I'm surprised he played here, to be honest, but I hope he gets a regular starting place now - we shall see in Kiev. We had some enjoyable banter at Paul Robinson's expense, too, calling him Tottenham's No 2.<br><strong><br>The fan's player ratings</strong> Almunia 7; Sagna 7, Tour\u00e9 8, Gallas 6, Clichy 8; Ebou\u00e9 6 (Ramsey n/a), F\u00e1bregas 8, Denilson 7, Walcott 9 (Song 8); Van Persie 7 (Wilshere n/a); Adebayor 9</p> <p><em><strong>To take part in the fans' verdict, email<br>fans@observer.co.uk</strong></em></p>",

He never began to live up to his price tag on the track, but he is to become a stallion based in Florida next year, servicing mares at a fee of $5,000 (\u00a32,800) a go. It will take 3,200 mares before he has recouped his purchase price.</p> <p><strong>Wragg yard on market</strong></p> <p>Veteran trainer Geoff Wragg's decision to retire at the end of this season is set to create a vacancy at one of Newmarket's most desirable stables.

But those feeling they have missed the colours this season are right - Sheikh Mohammed has not had a single runner under his own name in Britain or Ireland. Even so, the Dubai leader is more involved in racing than ever through his Godolphin stable, while his wife, Princess Haya, has had more than 40 runners, including Derby winner New Approach. The Sheikh's son Hamdan has had around 90 representatives.</p> <p><strong>Statto solicits</strong></p> <p>It's good to see Angus Loughran, formerly 'Statto' of Fantasy Football, bouncing back from his recent bankruptcy.

  "<p>Two goals from Kris Boyd put <strong>Rangers</strong> clear at the top of the SPL, but they were made to work hard for their 2-1 home win over a determined <strong>Kilmarnock</strong> side. Frazer Wright capitalised on a slip by home goalkeeper Allan McGregor after nine minutes to put the visitors in front. But Boyd struck a penalty - awarded when Manuel Pascali felled substitute Nacho Novo in the 58th minute - past Alan Combe and later spun to strike his second goal against his old club. </p> <p>Rangers endured a nervous end to the game when Sasa Papac was dismissed after collecting a second yellow card for a foul on Donovan Simmonds with a minute to go. But the Ibrox side held on for the win that allowed them to put three points between themselves and their nearest challengers</p> <p>A goal from Neil McCann, three minutes into the contest against his former club, <strong>Hearts</strong>, sent <strong>Falkirk</strong> on their way to a 2-1 victory and lifted the Bairns off the foot of the SPL. McCann collected a Graham Barrett pass before shooting low into the corner of the net. </p> <p>Midfielder Michael Stewart pushed the visitors on in the second period and his low, long-range shot past goalkeeper Robert Olejnik brought the scores level. The hosts were not to be denied their first three points of the season and Scott Arfield provided the winning goal in the last minute. </p> <p>A double strike from Steven Fletcher gave <strong>Hibs</strong> a 2-1 victory over <strong>Dundee United</strong>. Fletcher broke the deadlock midway through the first half with a diving header to open his tally for the season. Defender Lee Wilkie struck an impressive 25-yard shot low past Yves Ma-Kalambay to level the scores at half-time. </p> <p>The home side brought on Derek Riordan in the second half and he played a part in restoring their lead seconds after Ma-Kalambay made a great save to deny Francisco Sandaza from close range. He began the move with a pass to Dean Shiels inside the centre circle and Colin Nish was also involved before Fletcher placed the ball into the net from 18 yards out. </p> <p>Hibs were reduced to 10 men in the 68th minute, when Sol Bamba was shown his second yellow card.</p> <p>Teenager James McCarthy inspired a fine comeback as <strong>Hamilton Accies</strong> won 2-1 at Pittodrie. Midfielder Gary McDonald's first goal for <strong>Aberdeen</strong> gave the hosts the advantage after seven minutes, but they failed to build on their early lead. Billy Reid changed his midfield in the 32nd minute, when he brought on McCarthy, who made his Republic of Ireland Under-21 debut in midweek in Portugal, for Tony Stevenson. </p> <p>McCarthy was involved in the equaliser two minutes later, but David Graham deserved all the credit for a magnificent volley. The teenager's cross from the left eventually dropped for Graham, 16 yards from goal, and the winger struck the ball first time into the top corner. Accies clinched the game when McCarthy burst on to Richard Offiong's header in the 59th minute and hooked the ball over Jamie Langfield from 15 yards out. </p> <p><strong>St Mirren </strong>also came back from a goal down to collect three away points with a 2-1 win at the Caledonian stadium. Youngster Adam Rooney scored his first goal for <strong>Inverness Caley</strong>, and the 6,000th goal in the SPL, to spark into action a drab first-half contest. </p> <p>Rooney score dwith a penalty two minutes before half-time and almost capitalised on a Will Haining mistake, but his effort smashed off Mark Howard's bar. Caley paid the price on 61 minutes. A long ball was flicked on by Hamilton to Billy Mehmet, who beat defenders Phil McGuire and Jamie Duff to the ball and struck it past Michael Fraser. The visitors clinched the points on 80 minutes, when the ball fell at the back post for Garry Brady to smash into the net and seal a deserved win for Saints.</p>",
  "<p>Nothing ranks higher in the demonology of the Labour movement than 'the Tory press'. It printed the forged Zinoviev Letter, which won the 1924 election for the Tories with the false but subtle claim that Labour's softness towards the Soviet Union was encouraging communists to plot a revolution in Britain. It so smeared Neil Kinnock, the hopeless John Major won the 1992 election. For almost a century, the Labour tradition held that if its leaders did not win or if left-wing arguments did not convince, it was not because the leaders were fallible or arguments weak but because the Tory press had convinced voters to ignore them.</p> <p>Although Labour people believed the Tory press capable of anything, they would never have believed that the agents of a Labour Prime Minister would use it to destroy the reputation of a Labour minister. Last week, far too many MPs for Gordon Brown's comfort thought that was exactly what his supporters had done to Ivan Lewis.</p> <p>The junior minister is a political ally of Alan Johnson, the affable health secretary, who as one of the few politicians in Westminster who can speak to the English working class is also a potential candidate for Brown's job. In March Lewis wrote that Labour needed 'national renewal and a new generation of political leadership'. You did not need to be a code-breaker to know he meant that Brown was yesterday's man. In August, he argued that the government should tax the rich not the middle class, hardly a radical argument for a Labour politician, but one Brown did not want to hear.</p> <p>Lewis ought to have known that Whitehall had a secret which could hurt him. In 2006, he had a mid-life crisis. He left his wife of 16 years and mother of his two children and fixed his attention on Susie Mason, a young civil servant in his office. As far as we know the dozens of text messages he sent her were not nasty, but Lewis certainly pestered her. She protested, and Whitehall moved her to another job. Her complaint lay in the cabinet office files.</p> <p>Last Sunday the News of the World and Mail on Sunday had it all over their front pages. A Mafia hit, muttered Labour MPs. The Brownites have taken out Lewis and warned others about the consequences of speaking freely. I was as interested in the minority who protested that the case against Brown had not been proven, and wondered if a gossipy civil servant had sold the story instead. Although they defended him, not one said: 'Come off it, Nick, Brown may be rough but he'd never allow his aides to stitch-up a colleague in the Tory tabloids.'</p> <p>They knew Brown's form too well. On the same day the Lewis story appeared, The Observer carried a fierce attack on David Miliband, the equally affable Foreign Secretary. It came from Derek Simpson, joint leader of the Unite union. As everyone at the TUC conference was pointing out, Charlie Whelan is Brown's man in the union movement, and runs Unite's political department.</p> <p>First Johnson and then Miliband. As the Don went for all his enemies at once, the Sunday papers looked like the closing scenes of The Godfather</p> <p>A few days earlier, I had listened open-mouthed as a Brownite delivered a jeering, contemptuous assault on Alistair Darling for the mistake of speaking incautiously to the Guardian. It wasn't only the tone that riled me, but the knowledge that Darling was not Brown's enemy but a friend who was uncomplainingly cleaning up the mess his master had left at the Treasury. 'Loyalty is what the bosses screw you with,' trade unionists used to say, and Darling's trusting nature made him a soft target for the Brownites.</p> <p>Last month, an article in the Telegraph (another Tory paper) claimed Miliband would appoint Alan Milburn as his Chancellor if he replaced Brown. The story wasn't true, Miliband categorically denied it, but it was subtle. Milburn's name is poison, in part because of the battering Brown's aides gave him. No challenger would win the votes of the unions and constituency parties if they thought he wanted to bring the 'uber-Blairite' back to power.</p> <p>I don't want to be too prissy. All Prime Ministers need their thugs, and there is much that is noble in Brown's efforts since 1997 to reduce poverty and rebuild the schools and hospitals of Britain. The trouble with the Brown administration is that increasingly its thuggish face is the only face on show. When he became Prime Minister, he promised to reach across the political spectrum. Like Sarkozy, Obama and McCain, he said he would build a government of all the talents. As the economic crisis has deepened, he has returned to his old sectarianism. Downing Street is now a bunker filled with his gang of trusties: men with few discernible qualities beyond a cultish devotion to their leader.</p> <p>They think they can carry on as they did in the days when they went for Alan Milburn, and do not understand how the world has changed. One of the ugliest aspects of politics is the sycophancy which surrounds successful leaders. When his colleagues thought Brown had a strong grip on the economy, many admired his strong-arm tactics. The one complemented the other and showed that Brown was a leader in control. His failure has shifted the ground rules. Now the economy is falling apart his colleagues are likely to be far less indulgent.</p> <p>'A bully is less frightening when he's weak,' as one senior figure explained to me. Many are now grasping that no law says Gordon Brown is the only Labour politician allowed to use the sneak attack; that nothing in the Labour party's constitution prevents his targets responding in kind.</p> <p>As rebels challenge his leadership this weekend, Brown should make his case for continuing in power honourably and fight his critics in the open. If he does not, he will find that the tactics of his made men will destroy his premiership.</p>",
  "<p>By withdrawing from their wheelchair basketball match against the US, purportedly as an objection to the time of the tip-off, Iran ran a little geopolitical reality into the Beijing sporting bubble. Perhaps the Iranians really did not want to play at nine in the morning, but perhaps a game against Israel, had Iran lost the encounter with the US, might have been too much for Tehran to bear.</p> <p>For the past five weeks China has wrapped a ring-fence around the athletes of the world and there has been nothing to worry about other than the minutiae of their sports. There were, for example, the Olympic fractions of a second relevant to Usain Bolt or Michael Phelps.</p> <p>And there came the frozen Paralympic moment when Thierry Mabicka of the Gabon, parked on the final bend in an everyday wheelchair, watched as the other racers in the 800m T54 field, in their state-of-the-art racing chairs, bore down on him, about to lap him, or worse clip him. The Japanese Paralympian did just that and crashed over. It was one of the smaller pile-ups at the Bird's Nest over the past seven days.</p> <p>Of course there is a difference between the Olympics and the Paralympics. Perhaps it is at its most stark in the International Broadcast Centre, a vast convention centre next to the national stadium, converted for the duration of the two games into a giant television production house.</p> <p>In August, NBC, the American rights' holder, had 2,700 employees on site. For September's Paralympics there are just five NBC staff here. The IBC is a mausoleum.</p> <p>If the broadcasters of the world generally turned their back on the second games before they had even started, the Paralympians arrived with trumpets at the ready. The president of the International Paralympic Movement is Sir Philip Craven, a no-nonsense 58-year-old former wheelchair basketball player from Bolton.</p> <p>His fanfare sounded two messages. The first was to declare a sort of war on the word 'disability'. Concentrate on ability, we were told, admire the minds of these Paralympians and look at their powers of invention and their ability to compensate for missing parts. They deserved consideration as individuals.</p> <p>This was all very well, but it meant that the party began with what was almost a threat. Respect us, or else.</p> <p>The second message was almost the counterpoint, as if somebody had a quiet word with the president and told him not to be quite so heavy. 'Don't think too much about the Paralympics; just get out and enjoy them, like any other sport.'</p> <p>This was easy. Within the Beijing bubble all these athletes - I suppose it is the swimmers who do so most obviously - stripped off and revealed themselves as they are. And how quickly you grow accustomed to the sight of men and women who end at the shoulder or knee.</p> <p>I think that is the turning point of the Paralympics, when the body shape ceases to be the focal point, when the involuntary spasm of the boccia player with cerebral palsy simply means a good position on the scoreboard may have been surrendered.</p> <p>The sport takes over. The British Paralympic cycling has somehow managed to outdo the feats of the Olympic cyclists. They all train together anyway, the lines between Chris Hoy and Darren Kenny blurred by a common desire to take cycling into a prominent position in the public's consciousness, an awareness not seen since John Dunlop invented the pneumatic tyre.</p> <p>There is one extra element to these Paralympic performers. Practically all of them have a life story that contains a chapter on mere survival, never mind reaching an elite position in sport. There's Hou Bin, the one-legged high jumper, whose event has been discontinued, but who was entrusted with the task of hauling himself up to the roof of the Bird's Nest to light the torch at the opening ceremony. When he was nine, he was struck by a train while crossing the track with his schoolmates.</p> <p>As he lay on the ballast, wondering how he would be able to tell his mother he had lost his leg by not listening to her, he saw blue sky through the heads of all these adults staring down at him. And he said that there was hope, even at that moment. He would survive.</p> <p>There is something about the refusal to give up that puts the preciousness of a fairly large portion of able-bodied sportspeople to shame. If the Paralympic athletes moan it is only because they have failed to live up to their own expectations.</p> <p>But whatever the triumph of Craven's quest for respect, there is still a problem with the Paralympics. The classifications sometimes defy analysis. There's obviously some science involved in deciding who has what missing and into which category they therefore fit. But there also seems to be a certain amount of guesswork, like putting seekers of a category in the pool and asking them to swim around a bit.</p> <p>And a few Paralympians cheat, even inventing disability, like the Spanish basketball team in the Intellectually Disabled class in Sydney. It was found there was nothing wrong with them. It now seems the ID class is to be reintroduced for the London Paralympics of 2012. How can you check?</p> <p>The overwhelming impression though, from within this well protected Beijing bubble, is that something remarkable has been going on. We shall, however, only be able to acknowledge Craven's definitive victory when he can lead his movement out of the security zone into the world of geopolitical reality, and nobody bats an eyelid when Igor Plotnikov stands bare-chested before it.</p>",
  "<p>One doesn't know whether to be amused or alarmed by top universities such as Oxford and Cambridge declaring that 'it is not their place to help the poor', in response to government plans to admit more students from state schools and underprivileged backgrounds. In turn, Universities Secretary John Denham retorted that a state school influx would in no way undermine results, and that such establishments have a 'duty to promote social justice'.</p> <p>Indeed, all week the two factions have been banging heads at the annual conference, Universities UK, which has proved a mixed blessing. On the one hand it's akin to a delicious Monty Python sketch - one could almost imagine John Cleese in a mortarboard doing his funny walk up to the podium. On the other, how unedifying to see our educational elite scrapping in public.</p> <p>I suppose one has to be mature and resist the natural inclination to turn this into a 'Toffs versus Plebs' stand-off. A great shame, as in many ways, it's asking for it. In 2008, are we actually supposed to tug forelocks and accept Cambridge professor Alison Richard opining: 'It is not our place to help the poor'? In the same week that Harriet Harman was criticised for raising the issue of class in a speech to the TUC? And with figures revealing that 40 per cent of the Oxford and Cambridge intake is from fee paying schools, when the educational private sector represents only 7 per cent of the nation's children?</p> <p>It transpires that what Richard actually said was that education institutions such as Cambridge should not be turned into 'handmaidens of industry, implementers of the skills agenda, or indeed engines for promoting social justice'. Which seems to be a roundabout way of saying that dons are genuinely concerned about the government shoehorning in state students, with a less impressive academic record, at the expense of undermining the world-famous Oxbridge brand. All fair points, until you ask the question - whose universities are they anyway?</p> <p>The short answer being - all of ours. Which is why establishments such as Oxford and Cambridge should start working out a way to be genuinely accessible, and stop this weasel behaviour towards state schools that increasingly makes them resemble third-rate magicians ('Now you see a chance to get in, now you don't!'). If they don't, they will continue to come across, maybe erroneously, as an intellectual elite, puffed up with their own importance, apparently above reproach, who believe their only public duty is to exchange bon mots in flawless Mandarin with hothoused middle-class brats.</p> <p>For once the parents and the private schools cannot be blamed - parents who opt for private schooling tend to be quite upfront about the fact that the worm at the end of the hook is entrance to a decent university. For their part, the private schools are just as clear that this is what they're offering. It is only the universities who seem determined to walk around whistling with their hands in their pockets, pretending that nothing remotely unfair is going on, that entrance is an even playing field, success or failure depending entirely on the individual, and ... phooey! Let's be honest, in education, background (and by association, guidance and expectation) is all.</p> <p>Nor for that matter have universities ever been asked to 'help the poor'. They have only ever been asked to help the 'poor and bright' - talented youngsters who are ill-served by the current system, thus going some way to explaining their less impressive academic record. Or so one would hope.</p> <p>Certainly, when the freshly 'unretired' Lance Armstrong says that cycling up mountains is harder than riding on flat roads, we believe him. Similarly, when Ellen MacArthur explains that storms at sea can slow a boat down, we don't hoot derisively, and shout: 'Excuses, excuses!' Odd then how certain people won't accept that a state-educated student might have faced tougher challenges, at the very least fewer facilities and larger class sizes, than a private school candidate. So, while their grades may seem 'lower', they are, in real terms, anything but.</p> <p>Isn't this what this talk of 'social justice' amounts to? Not the spectre of the Oxbridge brand being dragged through the mud - dreaming spires overrun with skateboarding hoodies demanding 'David Beckham studies' - just calling a halt to what amounts to 'educational apartheid', and operating a fairer system, incorporating a sliding scale of grades that sees students from all backgrounds in with a chance. The dons are right - top universities do need protecting. But this time for all our children.</p> <h2>Take off those Rose-tinted specs - the Troubles weren't romantic</h2> <p>Has US actress Rose McGowan received a sharp blow to the head? It's just that she seems confused, and on so many levels. Starring as an IRA operative in the film, Fifty Dead Men Walking, McGowan, half-Irish, declares that, had she lived through the Troubles, she would definitely have joined the IRA.</p> <p>First of all, McGowan is 35 - when did she think the Troubles were? Sometime in the 18th century?</p> <p>More seriously, does McGowan sincerely wish she'd been there - risking life and limb for her principles one minute, planting bombs in Wimpy bars and kneecapping joyriders the next?</p> <p>Or is this yet another example of Irish-American sentimentality about 'freedom fighters' and the 'old country'? A phenomenon not confined to the US by any means but seemingly strongest there, and which surely played its own small, but highly irritating and ill-informed part, in keeping the Troubles going.</p> <p>I'm guessing that, born and bred a Kelly, and with skin that freckles like egg custard, I'm at least part Irish myself.</p> <p>However, that doesn't mean I could begin to understand the Irish problem - all that good and bad, courage and cruelty, life and death, on both sides.</p> <p>Curiously, a small but key element of Irish-America never seemed to have the same problem - thinking they understood it plenty, to the point where Bill Clinton always seemed keener on the romantic notion of 'liberating Ireland from tyranny!' rather than helping former Prime Minister Tony Blair and the Irish negotiators do the hard, tiring, unglamorous work that was needed.</p> <p>Maybe this is what McGowan should remember the next time she drifts into an IRA fantasy, perhaps working a 'hot' beret-and-dynamite look. The Troubles were not a movie, they were a nightmare, and those who really were involved, on either side, seem grateful to be coming out of them.</p> <h2>Let's stop this daft talk of Maggie the softie</h2> <p>One hopes Margaret Thatcher's planned visit to Chequers yesterday went off without a hitch. It must have been a diversion to be the guest of the Prime Minister in the week your only daughter publishes a book outlining your descent into dementia. </p> <p>All week, one has been hearing about how pleased Lady Thatcher was to be invited, and how she misses Chequers. Then there were articles revisiting her tearful exit from power. </p> <p>You know the kind of thing: Maggie, in her last days, accompanied by Denis, tenderly stroking banisters at one parliamentary residence, practically burying her face, sobbing, into the curtains, at another. All of which strikes the wrong note. After all, this was the woman who crushed the miners, and sank the Belgrano, not a housewife downsizing. It's uncharted territory, but there seems to be one rule for how male Prime Ministers are considered retrospectively, quite another for the only female one. You never hear stories about Winston Churchill pining for the potted plants at Number 10, or Harold Wilson helping Mary fold pillowcases. </p> <p>Indeed, political men are nearly always depicted 'musing on their legacies' in a quiet, yet suitably macho way. Even accounts of neat freak Hitler shooting himself don't digress into him suggesting a tidy up of the bunker first. So why does Margaret get lumbered? And what lies behind the public need to turn this driven and fascinating old dragon into the new Queen Mother? </p> <p>Thatcher never wanted to be liked, so she would have hated all these attempts to render her more cuddlesome. Her attitude would be: 'Fine, bury me like the Queen Mother, but don't you dare remember me as such. For good or ill, I was more than that.' And fair enough. People didn't vote for her, or want her out, because she was a softie. Love her, hate her, but let us afford Thatcher more dignity.</p>",
  "<p>Mariely Robles is proud of her baby bump. She wears low-slung, pink tracksuit bottoms and a tight T-shirt so that her stomach, stretched smooth with child, protrudes nakedly over her waistband. At the convenience store where she is buying soda with her friend, she rests one hand on her tummy. A small, yappy dog dressed in shorts is slung over her right arm. 'He's called Bambi,' she says, with a sweet smile.</p> <p>Mariely is 16. Her baby - a girl - is due in little more than a fortnight. 'I am happy about it,' she says in a quiet voice. 'I chose to have a baby.' Why? She looks at me vacantly, a smattering of freckles over the bridge of her nose. 'Because ... I guess I want to be a mother.'</p> <p>It is as good an answer as any you will find in Gloucester, Massachusetts. It is an answer that resounds far beyond this small working seaport, an answer that criss-crosses the length and breadth of a country where teenage pregnancy is worn as a curious badge of honour. In America it seems that young motherhood has become something to be proud of, a status symbol that is preferable to abortion, and an ethical choice that speaks of family values rather than family breakdown. Over recent weeks it has even become something of a vote-winner. When John McCain's vice-presidential candidate, Sarah Palin, revealed that her 17-year-old daughter was expecting her first child it contributed to a 4 per cent Republican lead in the polls. </p> <p>Pregnancy plays well in the US. When Britney Spears's younger sister, Jamie Lynn, gave birth in June at the age of 17, she promptly signed an exclusive magazine deal and was photographed on the cover, holding her child and extolling the virtues of being a 'mom'. The hit film Juno, which features a teenage girl who chooses to go through with an unplanned pregnancy, grossed more than $229m and won a 2008 Academy Award.</p> <p>In a country with a strong evangelical streak, there are a growing number of social conservatives who are, like Palin, fervently anti-abortion. Increasingly teenage motherhood is seen as a responsible social decision rather than the shameful consequence of a regrettable mistake. </p> <p>According to Dr Mike Males, a sociologist and senior researcher at the Centre on Juvenile and Criminal Justice in San Francisco, young motherhood is now viewed as a viable strategy for women lower down the socio-economic scale rather than as evidence of a dysfunctional society. 'Because poorer groups tend to die younger, having babies early in life may ensure that grandparents and extended family members will be alive and healthy enough to help raise children,' he said. Males cites a 2005 study that found that former teenage mothers who are freed from child-raising duties by their late twenties or early thirties have, by the age of 35, 'earned more in income, paid more in taxes, were substantially less likely to live in poverty and collected less in public assistance than similarly poor women who waited until their twenties to have babies'.</p> <p>The sub-text is clear: that, far from being victims of deprivation and ignorance, young girls are choosing to become mothers in a society that increasingly celebrates teenage parenthood as the wholesome alternative to abortion. Not everyone agrees. In the days after Palin announced that Bristol was expecting, Democratic bloggers accused her of exploiting her own daughter to further her 'regressive' pro-life policies.</p> <p>Is Bristol Palin's pregnancy to be applauded, or is it evidence of an uncomfortable cultural shift that has seen a substantial and irreversible erosion of women's rights over the past decade? Mariely Robles might not realise it yet, but her baby bump is fast becoming a political issue.</p> <p>Gloucester is a faded-round-the edges city of clapboard houses and mosquito screen doors. Perched on the edge of the sea, 45 minutes north of Boston, it is a place used to extremes - the 30,000 inhabitants can remember 20in of snow a few years ago and, last week, the pebbled shoreline was buffeted by heavy downpours. It was here, 17 years ago, that six fishermen were sucked under the sea in a tempest immortalised in the book and film The Perfect Storm.</p> <p>Back in June, the people of Gloucester found themselves at the centre of a different kind of storm. At Gloucester High School, 18 teenagers, aged 14 to 16, were rumoured to have formed a 'pregnancy pact'. At the time Dr Brian Orr, the director of Gloucester High's independent medical centre, diagnosed 'an epidemic'. In a school of 1,200 students, the centre had administered 150 pregnancy tests between October 2007 and May 2008. Members of staff saw girls high-five each other when the results were positive. Some of them broke into smiles. One of them simply exclaimed: 'Sweet!'</p> <p>The television crews descended en masse, pitching their cameras outside the red-brick school building and hoping to catch a passing pregnant belly on film. One TV studio paid for a baby shower in return for an exclusive interview with a pregnant teen. There was much discussion about what had gone wrong in Massachusetts, a state that prided itself on having the second-lowest teen pregnancy rate in the country.</p> <p>Gradually the residents of Gloucester became wary of being the focus of attention. It is a tight-knit and predominantly Catholic community that protects its own. People stopped talking. Doors closed. The girls involved - including Mariely Robles - denied the existence of a pact. Four months later, it is almost impossible to get anyone to speak about it. 'You should leave those poor girls alone,' says one woman as soon as she hears my English accent. 'What happens here is no different from anywhere else in America.'</p> <p>To an extent, this is true - 750,000 American women aged 15-19 become pregnant every year. According to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, the teen birth rate rose in 2006 for the first time since 1991 to 41.9 births per 1,000 - a 3 per cent increase from 2005.</p> <p>Teen pregnancy rates remain substantially higher in rural, poorer areas - in 2000 birthrates were highest in Mississippi, Texas, Arizona, Arkansas and New Mexico. Gloucester, with its impressive rows of porch-fronted houses facing out to sea, does not immediately seem to fit the profile. But it is a city with a split personality: the centre of town, with its craft boutiques and seafood restaurants, gives an impression of easy affluence, yet on the outer fringes there are pockets of noticeable economic deprivation. The once thriving fishing industry has suffered from the disappearance of jobs overseas. There is an endemic heroin problem. Teenagers have little to entertain them apart from a drive-through Dunkin' Donuts and the Cape Ann Lanes bowling alley. Lori Mitchell, whose daughter dropped out of school at 16 to have a baby, says there are worse ways to end up than as a teenage mother: 'They could be junkies or prostitutes.'</p> <p>Single teenage mothers are supported by government measures offering them subsidised housing and fuel assistance. In a city with few prospects, single motherhood is seen as a way out. Kevin Curley, a ruddy-faced former lobsterman with a strong Boston accent, puts it plainly: 'By getting pregnant, these girls can get a free house from the government. A lot of them saw their mothers grow up that way and a lot of them want to do the same. It beats getting a job.'</p> <p>But it would be too easy to dismiss Gloucester's teen mothers as welfare parasites and dropouts. The longer you spend here, the more it seems that young motherhood is a way of life. 'Sure, all my friends have children,' says Liz Rabbit, the 21-year-old receptionist at the Soft Touch hair salon. 'I'm used to it. I'm the odd one out for not having kids.'</p> <p>Of the young mothers I come across, the majority appear responsible, engaged parents and - perhaps because of my own inbuilt prejudice - this is profoundly unexpected. Part of the reason there has been such a build-up of resentment in Gloucester is that the teenagers have been caricatured as trailer-trash no-hopers in a way that Bristol Palin has not been. 'It's been made it into a class war,' says Lily Kennedy, a 44-year-old mother of three. 'These [pregnant] girls are actually good, sweet girls from strong family backgrounds who got confused, but they were treated like rednecks in the press. You don't hear that with Sarah Palin's daughter. Instead the Palins have been praised for staying together as a family.'</p> <p>Most of the teen mothers in question are either still at high school getting above average grades or have already graduated and are now in part-time employment. When I ask them about women's rights, about whether having babies at such a young age will harm their future life choices, it elicits a look of bafflement. 'This is my life choice,' says one of them, pushing a buggy along the street, with dark circles under her eyes. 'I didn't want an abortion and I'm not stopping anyone else having a career.'</p> <p>Hardly anyone wants to be quoted or photographed: people here are understandably wary of being made scapegoats or stereotypes. Alycia Verga is an exception. A pretty and articulate 21-year-old, Alycia was born and raised in Gloucester and suffered from bouts of depression from the age of 12. She found out she was pregnant while a student at the high school. It was planned, Alycia says, as a way of giving focus to her life. Two years ago she gave birth to Cadence, a giggly, energetic girl who runs around the garden in sparkly pink trainers getting streaks of dirt on her face as we talk. 'She saved my life,' says Alycia, who is engaged to be married but is no longer with Cadence's father. 'I love my daughter to death, and if it wasn't for her I wouldn't be here.'</p> <p>Alycia is fed up with strangers assuming she must be a bad mother simply because of her age. 'There are a lot of girls who don't take responsibility for their lives, who want to carry on going to parties when they have children and who rely on welfare. But I'm not one of them. I work part-time as a bus monitor because I need the income and I'm supported by my best friend and parents.'</p> <p>She was pleased that Bristol Palin's pregnancy had been given positive coverage but is worried that 'the media definitely encourages young girls to have babies without thinking it through. A lot of kids here look up to celebrities and a lot of girls become pregnant because they want comfort and love from somebody else that maybe they aren't getting from home. There are so many young parents in this town it makes it look easy'.</p> <p>Gloucester High School has a free daycare programme for the children of students, a service that is so oversubscribed that there is now a waiting list. But while federal funding is still available for daycare centres, sex education budgets have been drastically slashed over the past eight years because of the Bush administration's policy of funding abstinence-only programmes. </p> <p>There is now only one sex education co-ordinator in Massachusetts covering 360 districts and Gloucester's local health authorities do not allow the school clinic to hand out contraception without parental consent. It does not take a giant leap of logic to work out why, in a 2007 student health survey, 41 per cent of senior students here admitted they had sex without a condom.</p> <p>The cultural impact of these political decisions has made itself felt in myriad ways. At Gloucester High, the pupils are offered optional child study classes, but the issue of abortion is barely touched on. Only one of the original 18 pregnant teenagers opted for a termination. 'It's like a dirty word,' says Jacob Smith, 17. 'I am pro-abortion, but I try not to talk about it because it gets me into arguments with my friends. People get kind of angry. A couple of the girls at school just talk about having a baby all the time. They want to get knocked up and have children because they see everyone else doing it and they think it's cute.'</p> <p>Patricia Quinn, the executive director of the Massachusetts Alliance on Teen Pregnancy, agrees that it is a constant battle to ensure that teens get access to information about sex from teachers and parents. 'We have to support our teenagers and allow them to make informed decisions. The Palin story highlights the fact that, despite her parents' best efforts to convey their values, in the end it is young people who decide what to do. We look at teens needing three things: the first is comprehensive sex education, the second is access to contraception, and the third is a perception of opportunity.'</p> <p>Arguably none of these is available either in Gloucester or in Wasilla, Alaska, where Bristol Palin grew up. </p> <p>According to Mike Males, the Palin pregnancy has highlighted the broader cultural attack on women's rights from both ends of the political spectrum. On the one hand, it has been used by liberals to emphasise the need for sex education, birth control and a woman's right to choose. On the other hand, said Males, the issue of teen pregnancy has also been exploited by rightwingers: 'There's a deliberate demonisation of teenagers in order to impose restrictions on behaviour they deem unacceptable. In that way the Republicans can promote their own socially conservative agenda.' </p> <p>The anti-abortion movement has made substantial inroads into the political landscape over the past decade. Pharmacists in several US states are now legally allowed to take a stand of 'conscientious refusal' in order to deny birth control, and most states now only allow abortion up to 13 weeks. The situation is exacerbated by the hardline religious groups that have made abortion into an almost apocalyptic issue. 'Women's rights are under fire,' said Males. 'The Palin pregnancy is a symbol of a society that is very uncohesive and becoming more so.'</p> <p>But in Gloucester the issue of teen pregnancy has, if anything, drawn this community closer together. People here are deeply protective of the adolescent girls who unwittingly found themselves the focus of international attention. Yes, they might have been misguided, they might have been foolish, and some of the pregnancies were unplanned, but perhaps they are no different from the thousands of other pregnant adolescents across America. </p> <p>The Gloucester teenagers will become parents over the next few months but they will also become a set of statistics; a series of anonymous percentage points to be bandied about by political factions in years to come. She might not know it yet, but Bristol Palin could end up having a far more lasting impact on her country's future than her mother ever will.</p> <h2>Teenage births</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> About a third of girls in the US become pregnant before the age of 20. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> In 2006, 435,427 children were born to mothers aged 15-19, a birth rate of 42 live births per 1,000 women in this group.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> More than 80 per cent were unintended, meaning that they occurred sooner than desired or were not wanted.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> In 2006, teenage birth rates rose for the first time since 1990. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The largest rise was among African-American teenagers.

  "<p>They were giggling in Scotland Yard's main canteen last night. 'You can't help but laugh when you see Blair slinging it out in public with his third in command,' said one constable, then his voice faltered. 'Funny, but embarrassing.' Five floors above, the head of Scotland Yard had long forgotten the funny side. Three years have passed since Sir Ian Blair became Metropolitan Police commissioner, hailed as a progressive liberal in tune with such politically correct times. Now, over a late canteen supper, his beat constables were sniggering at the irony of it all. None could have foreseen that Blair's tenure would become muddied by claims of systemic racism and an increasingly rancorous public mud-slinging match between himself and the most senior Asian officer in the country, Tarique Ghaffur. </p> <p>Last week relations between the two crumbled to a new low. On Wednesday Blair 'temporarily relieved' his third most senior officer of his duties after Ghaffur revealed details of his racial discrimination case against the Scotland Yard commissioner. Hours later Yasmin Rehman, the most senior Muslim woman in the Met, stepped forward to reveal she too had been 'bullied' and lodged a claim of racial discrimination against her superiors. More bad news for Blair may follow. Lawyers for Ghaffur and Rehman estimate 19 racial discrimination cases are lined up against the Yard.</p> <p>Something has clearly gone wrong at the heart of the Met, but beyond the claim and counter-claim of personal agendas and public smears, the debate boils down to one simple question: is Scotland Yard in 2008 racist? </p> <p>A knot of senior black and Asian officers believe it is, many others do not. All agree that racists are employed by the Met, yet few believe that it is a racist institution. </p> <p>Almost 10 years have passed since Sir William Macpherson's seminal report, commissioned after the murder of black teenager Stephen Lawrence, famously branded the Met 'institutionally racist'. The arrival of Blair was hailed as the final piece in the race relations jigsaw, an appointment crafted to ensure the recent turmoil could never occur. </p> <p>Last week within the febrile canteen culture of the Yard, theories swept through the rank and file over how the Oxford University graduate could find himself personally embroiled in such a damaging race row. One repeated consensus among constables blames an ineffectual leadership style that has fostered a culture of political infighting and allegations of prejudice. Their official voice, the Metropolitan Police Federation, which represents 24,000 constables, maintains it has no confidence in Blair's leadership. </p> <p>One leading officer claimed that Blair's determination to broaden equal opportunities may, in fact, have proved to be his 'Achilles heel'. Detective Constable Peter Smyth, the chairman of the Met constables' branch, added: 'If anything he may have been too soft, giving people the freedom to play the \"race card\" for financial and career opportunities. There is a feeling that some have taken advantage of his liberal style.' Others said Blair is the high-profile scalp of an orchestrated campaign whose motives were more prosaic than the inflammatory charges of racism suggest. </p> <p>One said: 'If I was a cynic then I might suggest the problem began when the National Black Police Association [which is backing both Ghaffur and Rehman's legal action] had their funding cut by the Home Office earlier this year. To prove they needed funding, they needed a problem. Who knows?' One solicitor from London discrimination specialists Palmer Wade, which has recorded an increase in claims from serving officers against the Met, believes that a critical mass has been reached whereby more black and Asian officers are having the confidence to sue Scotland Yard. </p> <p>'The fact that more senior officers are taking this course could encourage more junior ranks to follow. Maybe there still is institutional racism, but it's not that easy to make that sort of allegation,' said Melanie Thomas. </p> <p>Yet all are unanimous that Blair himself is no racist. 'Blair does not have a racist bone in his body,' said Smyth. Many constables take the view that Blair was actually too zealous in ramming home his diversity agenda. Months after taking control, an employment tribunal accused the commissioner of attempting to bolster his anti-racist credentials by hanging three white officers out to dry over alleged racist remarks. </p> <p>However, Jan Berry, former chair of the Police Federation, said the wider issue was not race relations but the increasingly politicised role of head of Scotland Yard. Experienced observers reckon it may well be the hardest job in the country, the poisonous politics of Whitehall a tea party by comparison. </p> <p>Berry said: 'It is a position where you cannot please everybody all the time. Whoever does the job must follow a very difficult path. The role of commissioner has become part-politician, part-advisor, part-counsellor, and you will always attract enemies.'</p> <p>She rejects any notion that Blair has fostered a culture of racism. 'There will still be racism and people will still carry prejudices, but compared with many years ago the situation is much better - the service has come on leaps and bounds,' she said. </p> <p>One serving detective added: 'Is there an issue with racism in the Met? Every major organisation, I suspect, has racists. Is there a massive problem? No, I don't think so.' </p> <p>On face value, internal data confirms that Scotland Yard has in fact made impressive strides in recruiting black and Asian officers. Latest figures reveal that one in five officers joining the yard is from an ethnic minority. When Blair took over in 2005 there were 2,259 ethnic minority officers in the Met. At the end of July the figure had risen to 2,608 from a total of 31,363. By comparison, there were 426 in 1988. </p> <p>Yet one glaring weakness, which even Scotland Yard accepted yesterday remained an issue, is the number of black and Asian officers in positions of influence. Close scrutiny reveals that the numbers of Asian or black chief superintendents and inspectors have actually fallen on Blair's watch. Out of 78 chief superintendents, just one is currently from an ethnic minority. An internal document seen by the Observer profiles the entire Met chain of command in many London boroughs as simply 'white British'. Scotland Yard claims the status quo is a quirk of timing rather than anything sinister. </p> <p>'You are starting from a certain place and so it will take time, maybe a generation to change the picture,' said a Met source who conceded career 'progression' for ethnic minorities could be an issue. </p> <p>Even so, current recruitment trends are impressive. The ethnic minority intake is forecast to reach 9 per cent this year compared to 3 per cent in 2000. A recent recruitment fair attracted 1,200 people. One third were from ethnic minorities. </p> <p>Despite this, the fact remains that Britain's biggest police force will miss the ethnic minority recruitment targets laid out by Macpherson by a significant margin. Next year the Met should have 25 per cent of its officers from ethnic minorities. There is 'no chance' of reaching the target, according to Met sources. </p> <p>Yet the thorny question of whether racial discrimination is directed towards recruits once they have joined the force is harder to quantify. The Metropolitan Police Federation is funding between 15 and 20 racial discrimination cases a year. Smyth explains a small increase in cases as being more reflective of the larger number of black and Asian officers than any tangible increase in racism. He said: 'In general terms I really don't know why the issue has come to light now because things are improving. Conspiracists might argue that it is a fairly well orchestrated campaign by a particular group, and non-accidental.' </p> <p>The Independent Police Complaints Commission said that it could not recall a single case of racial discrimination it was currently investigating. </p> <p>Yet some lawyers bringing race cases against the Met are unsure if Blair's progressive stance on diversity issues has had the desired affect. Shahrokh Mireskandari, who is representing Ghaffur and Rehman, and has close links with the NBPA, believes that racial discrimination in terms of career progression and attitude is 'rife' within Blair's Met. </p> <p>Melanie Thomas added that while Blair's tranche of diversity and equality policies might look impressive, within the hard-nosed world of modern policing they count for little. 'My impression is that there are a staggering number of diversity policies, guidance and studies, a tremendous amount of material, but ask anyone what they really mean and they will not be able to tell you.' </p> <p>From the moment Ghaffur revealed he was suing the force for racial discrimination, tensions among the Yard's senior command grew increasingly strained. Tempers finally snapped last week. Within hours of Ghaffur being told that he was being temporarily relieved, the 'gold command' of the National Black Police Association convened for an emergency summit. The gloves were off; the talk was of a race war.</p> <p>A vote of no confidence in Blair and his plethora of diversity policies was discussed, but far more damaging was the motion to start actively dissuading other black and ethnic minorities throughout London from joining the Met. The president of the NBPA, Chief Superintendent Ali Dizaei, said: 'It is our duty - they need to be told that they will be hounded and targeted if they join.' The association believes the Met instigated a smear campaign last week that questioned the credibility of both Dizaei and Mireskandari, the latter being accused by one newspaper of being a convicted fraudster, which he denies. Scotland Yard strenuously reject any suggestion of involvement.</p> <p>'The bottom line is that any racism headline is not good for the Met. None of this benefits anyone who cares about its reputation,' said Met spokesman Ed Stearns. </p> <p>The accusations levelled at Dizaei, one of the yard's most controversial senior officers, took a more serious twist last Friday with claims he advised a defence team in a Met prosecution. Dizaei said: 'It's simply untrue, but I've got used to such attacks against my character over the years.' Hours later the Metropolitan Police Authority announced it was investigating the allegations. Two days earlier it had started a separate inquiry into Ghaffur over 'potential grounds of misconduct' after the 53-year-old spoke publicly about his discrimination case. Ghaffur's claim alleges the MPA leadership is racist, a charge it rejects. </p> <p>This week calls for the Home Secretary Jacqui Smith to intervene in the row are certain to mount. In addition, fresh evidence of a wider racist problem within the police is shortly to be published. Next month the first audit into the treatment of Muslim and black officers will be published. The study of the 43 forces in England and Wales will be published by the National Association of Muslim Police, a body which so far has been keen to distance itself from the slanging match surrounding Scotland Yard. For those who believe that, away from the Met, racial discrimination is not an issue, its contents will make sobering reading. Sources describe its findings as 'appalling' with employment rates of black and Asian officers well below the proportion of those in wider society. Zaheer Ahmad, president of the National Association of Muslim Police, said: 'That really is not good enough.'</p> <p>But it is his criticism of the Home Secretary that perhaps most threatens to spread the cry of racism from the Met to the heart of government. The Observer has learnt that the National Association of Muslim Police is considering submitting a formal complaint regarding the behaviour of the Home Secretary towards Muslim organisations. </p> <p>Despite arranging on three occasions to discuss the gravity of their findings with Smith, she has cancelled each time, the association claims. 'Can't she spend just 15 minutes in five months with us? These are incredibly important issues within the police service,' said Ahmad. Smith, he added, had also declined an invitation to attend a conference inside the Home Office to discuss Muslim women in the police force which is scheduled for November. The group increasingly believes that Smith does 'not want to be associated with a Muslim organisation. We are not an extreme organisation, we only want to be treated fairly.'</p> <p>Scrutiny of the Met, the Home Office and police forces on attitudes to race will also intensify following a BBC Panorama investigation to be broadcast shortly which features allegations of racism from serving black officers, a number from the Met. Rumours abound that the Muslim Council of Britain will soon wade into the row. Blair may not be alone in wondering when and where it will all end. </p> <p>Of course, it wasn't always diversity strategies and equal ops. Serving Met officers recall a time when racism was the norm. 'When I joined in the late Seventies, Britain and the Met were a very different place,' said one. 'We didn't think we were being offensive by using words that we wouldn't dream of using these days. In those days the word \"coloured\" was a polite term. Now there has been a complete turnaround and we're very aware, culturally and racially. </p> <p>'I would be surprised if there was another organisation that was more racially aware or politically correct than we are,' added Smyth. The fallout of Lawrence's murder at a bus stop in south London in 1993 is credited with transforming the landscape. Macpherson's defining report identified that systemic failures to tackle racism helped Lawrence's killers evade justice. In his 1999 report Macpherson defined discrimination as being 'unwitting prejudice, ignorance, thoughtlessness and racist stereotyping'. </p> <p>Last week, however, senior officers warned that such language may have allowed racists to avoid accepting responsibility for their behaviour. 'Perhaps it was a mistake, you have people who are out and out racists and that definition let them blame someone else,' said Berry. </p> <p>More directly, though, the tumult of last week is traceable to the fallout of a police investigation into Dizaei. He had been suspended in 2001 pending the completion of a criminal investigation into alleged fraud and perverting the course of justice. During a multi-million pound surveillance operation Dizaei was secretly recorded having lunch with Ghaffur. The assistant commissioner was incandescent upon discovering the covert operation and sensationally appeared as a surprise defence witness for Dizaei at his 2003 trial. Dizaei was acquitted of all charges.</p> <p>Many in the Met maintain the ongoing spat is rooted in Ghaffur's decision to ally himself to Dizae and in turn the controversial figure of Mireskandari. </p> <p>But new discrimination cases continue to come to light and it is these, according to equality groups, that are the true indicator of ongoing systemic prejudice. </p> <p>The Observer has learned of one case involving a former paratrooper and serving Met constable who is suing for racial discrimination. Derrick Quarm, a charity marathon runner who has taken three days' sick leave in eight years service, is suing the force for being overlooked for promotion on race grounds. Quarm has been rejected eight times despite claiming to possess a superior record to white peers. Thomas, his lawyer, said: 'He absolutely never wanted to sue, but felt he had no choice.' </p> <p>More twists in the Met's race row will no doubt surface this week, accompanied inevitably by growing demands for Ghaffur's employment tribunal to be dragged forward to avoid fresh stains on the Met's reputation. </p> <p>'The unfortunate thing is that it is being played out in the public arena where people can't really make a decision. It's not about sides, it's about fair treatment,' said Berry. </p> <p>For Blair it promises to be a particularly gruelling period. The inquest into the death of Jean Charles de Menezes will shortly begin with a forensic dissection of the systemic failure by Blair's force on the day the Brazilian was shot dead by police marksmen at Stockwell tube station. Evidence will detail how Blair obstructed efforts by the IPCC to investigate the tragedy. </p> <p>Last week marked the seventh anniversary of 9/11 and residents wonder whether the Met's command chain is distracted while the city remains on alert for a terrorist attack.</p> <p>For his part, Blair remains intent on riding out the race storm while accepting he and Ghaffur agree on one point: if the latter's discrimination case is successful, the Met's most liberal commissioner in history will be remembered by some as a racist.</p> <h2>Flashpoints for Blair</h2> <p><strong>The shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes</strong> </p> <p>In several days time Sir Ian Blair and his force will face their gravest scrutiny since the Stephen Lawrence inquiry at the inquest into the fatal shooting of De Menezes, the Brazilian mistakenly thought to be a terrorist. Yard insiders fear the hearing will expose excruciating details about the operational effectiveness of the force on that day, the overall efficacy of its current leadership and alleged attempts to cover-up who knew what when. Fresh revelations will ensure calls for Blair to step down reach a climax. </p> <p><strong>Claims of racism</strong> </p> <p>The Yard is mired in damaging claims of racial discrimination as the Met's third most senior officer, Tarique Ghaffur, presses ahead with a race bias and discrimination case against Sir Ian Blair. Other cases include Yasmin Rehman the force's head of diversity, who last week revealed she is also intending to sue her superiors along similar lines. Race equality groups claim the problem of racism may have worsened since a damaging report by Sir William Macpherson into the murder of Lawrence almost a decade ago. </p> <p><strong>Knife crime</strong></p> <p>Crime statistics reflecting a growing violent youth crime problem in the city which many residents fear is spiralling out of control. Latest figures for July alone revealed that 689 were knifed or battered with a weapon, 15,824 were beaten up or seriously harassed. In total 18 people were murdered that month, four of them black teenagers, victims of growing youth violence. The youngest, David Idowu, just 14, was stabbed through the heart on a summer evening on his way to a football match. </p> <p><strong>The terror threat</strong></p> <p>Scotland Yard counter-terrorism officials met for crisis talks last week after what they believed to be the strongest terrorism case ever presented to a court was rejected by a jury. At the end of a \u00a310m investigation and trial lasting more than two years, jurors were unable to decide whether or not a group of British Muslims were part of a plot to blow transatlantic airliners out of the sky. Although the Crown Prosecution Service subsequently said it would seek a retrial of seven of the accused, the jurors' verdict has prompted deep unease throughout the Met.</p> <h2>Ian Blair: Life and times</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <strong>1953</strong> Born in Chester.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Educated at Wrekin College, Shropshire, Harvard High School, Los Angeles and Christ Church, Oxford.

  "<p>Huge demonstrations brought Newcastle city centre to a near standstill yesterday as football fans protested against the loss of 'Geordie Messiah' Kevin Keegan.</p> <p>Hours before kick-off in Newcastle United's home match against Hull - the club's first game since Keegan resigned as manager, which ended in a 2-1 defeat - thousands of supporters gathered outside St James' Park to vent their frustration against owner Mike Ashley and the board. </p> <p>Police in high-visibility jackets had struggled to control the surging crowd in a noisy but peaceful protest at the club gates.

  "<p>He was one of the world's most prolific and secretive gamblers. The arrival at casinos in London of Fouad al-Zayat, the high roller know as the Fat Man, created panic and excitement and not a little rubbing of hands by management in their dinner jackets and black ties.</p> <p>Over 15 years, the 20-stone Syrian billionaire lost more than \u00a3191m on the spin of the roulette wheel. But now he is biting back by taking six prestigious British casinos to court, claiming they illegally allowed him credit. </p> <p>The move follows his recent victory in the High Court when his lawyers successfully argued that a \u00a32m debt with Aspinalls of Mayfair should be wiped out because they allowed him credit. </p> <p>In a rare interview in his marbled floor office in Nicosia, Cyprus, the Fat Man, a big beast even among the big spending gamblers known as 'whales', said he was now looking to claw back \u00a367m.</p> <p>Zayat, 67, who said he no longer gambled in casinos, claimed that while he was never an addict, his habit had been a form of escapism that wasted nearly a quarter of a billion pounds. 'When I looked at the table, and the wheel was spun, it took my mind away from anything else I was thinking about. All worries disappeared, except the game. The amount of money was not important. Today, I see my behaviour as very stupid whereas before I thought it was something.' </p> <p>Zayat's dispute with Aspinalls centred on a debt acquired in a single night in March 2006 after he cancelled a cheque for \u00a32m following a row over a croupier. The casino had allowed Zayat a 12-month delay in repayment, during which time he continued to gamble. The judge found the postponement amounted to illegal credit under the act.</p> <p>He has now instructed his solicitors at the West End firm Quastel Midgen to gather evidence from his files, which allegedly show he was given illegal credit of \u00a367m between 1989 and 2003. </p> <p>'The casinos woo you, they make it their business to become your friends,' he said. 'I have been called by them on birthdays, and relatives' birthdays; they try to become part of your life. When you go to them, you are offered the best hotel rooms and anything you may want, in order to get you to continue gambling. If that means giving you credit, and breaking the law, they will do it.'</p> <p>Zayat said he was riding high at London's tables in the 1990s when he won up to \u00a380m a year. In 1997, he said, he won \u00a342m in a year from Crockfords in Mayfair. 'I made that money in a month or so of visits. It was a good time,' he said.</p> <p>One casino official said his arrival at clubs would make staff tremble with excitement and alarm. Zayat would regularly give \u00a35,000 tips. His nickname was acquired, he said, because doormen in London's clubs needed a verbal shorthand to warn their management when the mysterious bulky Arab approached. </p> <p>At times, he loved the casino life - he could stay up all night meeting the world's richest and most influential people, he said, pitting his wits against the casino's management. He has sat at tables with the actor Tom Cruise, the arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi, senior members of the Saudi and British royal families and the Sultan of Brunei. </p> <p>Once, while playing roulette in Crockfords, Zayat noticed a brash Australian man watching him play. By this stage he had perfected his system and objected to being watched. 'I got him kicked off my table. But then I was told that the man was Kerry Packer,' he said. Packer, the late Australian tycoon, and Zayat spoke later that evening and played together on several occasions.

  "<p>Philip Roth's astounding and sustained period of late creativity has been notable for one unifying preoccupation: death. In novel after novel Roth, who is 75 and as prolific as ever (this is his 29th book), leads his ageing and diminished protagonists to the very edge of non-existence, only to leave them suspended, waiting, in a fury of metaphysical incomprehension and mourning. They mourn not only those they knew who have died but their own lost vitality, the reality of which they can never escape, assaulted as they are daily by the indignities of old age: impotence, incontinence, failing memory, bodily pain. 'The tragedy of the man not set up for tragedy,' Nathan Zuckerman says in American Pastoral, 'that is every man's tragedy'.</p> <p>But every man's tragedy, as Zuckerman also knows, is death. Everyman was the title Roth chose for the short, intense, rather beautiful novel he published in 2006, in which he told the story of a man's life through his various illnesses. He follows his nameless protagonist finally on to the operating table, where he has a heart attack and dies: 'He was no more, freed from being, entering into nowhere without even knowing it.' </p> <p>Yet it's not always the old and sickly who die. The young die, too, as another Roth alter ego, the libertine David Kepesh discovers when, in late middle age and having selfishly dedicated his life to the pursuit of sexual pleasure without responsibility, he suddenly and quite obsessively falls in love with one of his graduate students. Desire dislocates him. In his subsequent anguish and grief (the student develops breast cancer) Kepesh begins to re-evaluate the moral codes by which he has lived and to rage against what he considers to be a profound violation of the natural order of being. 'The loveliest fairy tale of childhood is that everything happens in order,' he says in The Dying Animal. 'Your grandparents go long before your parents, and your parents go long before you. If you're lucky it can work out that way, people ageing and dying in order... It hardly makes extinction less monstrous, that thought, but it's the trick that we use to keep the metronomic illusion intact and time torture at bay.'</p> <p>In this latest novel, Indignation, heightened awareness of the immanence of death, of how danger and threat lie in wait for all of us all of the time, torments the father of a promising Jewish student from Newark, New Jersey. The father is a kosher butcher, from a family of butchers, and he cannot bear to relinquish his son to the world beyond the protective shield of the family. His son, Marcus Messner, is an exceptional student who works part-time with his father in the family shop - the novel is set in 1951, the second year of the Korean war. Messner eventually chooses a university far away from home, in the Midwest, a conservative institution called Winesburg College. He is determined to escape from his ancestral inheritance, from the claustrophobia of family life, the shop, the stink of blood and uncooked meat. Above all, he wants to escape from his father's oppressive love, his protection, his anxiety. 'You are a boy with a magnificent future before you,' Marcus's father tells him. 'How do I know you're not going to places where you can get yourself killed?'</p> <p>In the event, the father is correct to have been abnormally concerned about his son, because it turns out that Messner does not have a future beyond the age of 19, the age at which he is killed in action in Korea (he has been drafted after being expelled from Winesburg following a series of comic clashes with the college authorities). And yet, after death, he experiences a peculiar kind of afterlife, existing everywhere and nowhere, condemned endlessly to shuffle through the events of his life. </p> <p>The conceit of the book is that, as in Alice Sebold's The Lovely Bones or Flann O'Brien's The Third Policeman or the films Sunset Boulevard and American Beauty, the narrator is dead. But unlike the unnamed protagonist of Everyman, death does not free Messner: it imprisons him in an 'endless nothing', where memory cogitates 'for eons on itself'. Messner has entered into nowhere but his misfortune is to know everything about it. Death for him offers no escape from life. That is what he believes is his ultimate fate, though Roth, who is an atheist, slyly opens up the possibility in the closing pages that oblivion is what awaits him, and all of us, after all.</p> <p>Indignation is the inevitable culmination of the death obsession in late-period Roth; in retrospect, it now seems like it was only a matter of time, if time allowed, before he imaginatively followed one of his protagonists from this life into the next, from the operating table into the endless nothing. </p> <p>Typically for a Roth creation, Messner is especially interested in the mystery of his first serious sexual encounter, when as a freshman he received a blow job in a car while on a first date with a fellow student, Olivia. In The Dying Animal, Kepesh jokes that the decades since the Sixties have 'done a remarkable job of completing the sexual revolution. This is a generation of astonishing fellators.' Indignation is set long before the social and political convulsions of the Sixties, and for the na\u00efve and virginal Messner to receive a blow job is an unexpected pleasure but also a huge surprise - a surprise because of the young woman's willingness to act, without any encouragement from him. 'I did that because I like you so much,' she tells him as afterwards he withdraws from her in confusion. Later, they come back together and an odd and affecting relationship develops between them, as Messner begins to see Olivia less as an object of sexual fantasy than as a complicated and disturbed young woman, with her own poignant needs and longings.</p> <p>The book is rather flatly written for the first quarter, in short, plain sentences, and there is little of Roth's usual fastidious attention to small detail. His depiction of the inner particularity of a butcher's shop is perfunctory compared with the radiant precision of his previous representations of, say, the workings of a glove factory, a jewellery store or a boxing gym.</p> <p>It's a risk, too, this attempt to write as an unsophisticated, non-literary 19-year-old, to be true to the integrity of who he is, to find an appropriate voice for him, without also resorting to the easy consolations of clich\u00e9, as Roth does early on. Then, almost incidentally, Messner, our narrator, tells us he is dead, after which the novel ignites, the sentences lengthen and the style becomes more expansive. You begin to hear more of the authentic Rothian tone: the urgency, the extremity, the scathing wit.</p> <p>Indignation is a strange, troubling and occasionally ridiculous book. The themes are very familiar: the role of a stern, overbearing father in the life of his restlessly rebellious son; the evocation of a lower-middle-class boyhood in what is now a vanished neighbourhood of Newark; the Jewish immigrant experience in America; the way we can all become caught up in and destroyed by historical forces beyond our control. It can be read, perhaps, most successfully as an addendum to Roth's recent fiction, as a novel engaged in a complicated conversation with those that preceded it, rather than as a significant work in its own right. And yet one is ultimately moved and fascinated by it: a great writer is a great writer even when he's on cruise control.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Jason Cowley is editor of the New Statesman</p>",
  "<p>Kate Rothko Prizel is a strong-looking woman with a disarming smile that she switches on and off like a flashlight. You sit opposite her, trying not to be distracted by the subliminal hum of the canvases on the walls - three early Rothkos to the right of me, and one to the left - and you wonder: how did she do it? How did she survive? Not that she even seems to know herself. 'I always tell people that 19 was the worst year of my life,' she says, with steady understatement. 'And everything has gone uphill from there.' </p> <p>The smile is duly turned on, and we gaze at one another for a moment. I can't make up my mind whether she is warning me off, or welcoming me in. Kate Rothko turned 19 almost four decades ago, in 1970; in some ways, the events we are about to discuss must feel as though they happened to another person, the facts both gilded and blurred by the weight of years. Then again, they are so starkly awful, it feels almost murderous to bring them up. What defences might I end up knocking down? It's hardly surprising that when she was younger and at medical school, Rothko would find herself categorically denying her relationship to that Rothko, or that later, when she married, she cloaked herself in her married name, Prizel, the better to be invisible.</p> <p>In 1970, on the cold morning of 25 February, the body of her father, the painter, Mark Rothko, was found in his cavernous Manhattan studio. He had overdosed on barbiturates, and cut an artery in his right arm with a razor blade. He was found in a pool of blood six by eight feet wide, wearing long johns and thick black socks. He left no note. He was 66. </p> <p>Six months later, on 26 August, Kate suffered another bereavement, less public, but just as bitter: at the age of 48, her mother, Mell, a book illustrator and Rothko's second wife, had dropped down dead as Kate's brother, Christopher, watched cartoons in the next room. The cause of death listed on her death certificate was 'hypertension due to cardiovascular disease'; however, like her estranged husband, she was a heavy drinker. </p> <p>Kate and Christopher, who was then just six years old, were now orphans (or The Orphans, as the art critic Robert Hughes referred to them some years later). But however terrible their grief, it seemed as if they would surely survive. It wasn't only that they would be OK financially; by 1970, Rothko's work was already achieving tremendous prices. It was more that Kate had always thought that 'the New York art world was the most idyllic place in which any child could grow up'; though their Rothko relatives were mostly out west and, to a degree, an unknown quantity, her father had been, in spite of his final catastrophic depression, a gregarious man, and a revered one. The family was nothing if not blessed with a multitude of friends.</p> <p>Or was it? It was the difference between the two funerals of her parents that revealed to Kate, even in the depths of her grief, that this might not, after all, be so. Perhaps the art world was not the bohemian extended family of her imagination. The two services took place in the same Manhattan funeral parlour, but they could not have been more different. After Mark's funeral, one art world viper is reputed to have remarked that it was 'the best vernissage of the season', and it is certainly true that it was well attended by the great and the good. Among the mourners were Willem de Kooning, Robert Motherwell, Philip Guston and Lee Krasner Pollock, not to mention the rows of critics, curators, and collectors. 'At my father's funeral, people were pouring out of the woodwork,' says Kate. 'But I would have to question why they were there, because only about 10 people came to my mother's. She'd known these people for 25 years, and now it was like she was... ' A footnote? 'Yes. It was disillusioning for me to see the superficiality of the art world, and that has never gone away, I must admit. It will never be that idyllic place for me again.' </p> <p>Unfortunately, there was worse to come. Within two years, Kate and her brother were fighting a legal battle of Bleak House proportions that few thought they could win - and her parents' 'friends', by now, were even thinner on the ground. 'They were waiting to see which way it was going to go. People were hesitant to talk to me. Only a few were willing to stick their necks out. Lee Krasner, for one, gave multiple interviews in which she said how unwise I was to be fighting the case.'</p> <p>Kate and Christopher sued the executors of their father's estate - his accountant, Bernard Reis, the painter Theodoros Stamos, and a professor of anthropology called Morton Levine (Levine was also, until Kate took steps to remedy the situation, Christopher's guardian) - and his gallery, the Marlborough, claiming that the former had conspired with the latter to 'waste the assets' of Rothko's estate and defraud them of their proper share. The assets were 798 paintings (then estimated to be worth at least $32m). They contended that the three trustees had conspired to sell these Rothkos to the Marlborough at less than their true market value; the gallery had, for instance, got its delighted hands on one group of 100 paintings for just $1.8m, a sum it would pay over 12 years and with no interest, with a down-payment of only $200,000. </p> <p>The case was to rumble on for more than four years, during which Kate was mostly living in a $90-a-week apartment in Brooklyn, watching what little money she had drain out of her bank account. It was to be seven long years before she had a Rothko of her own; if she wanted to see work by her father, her only option was to visit a gallery. How did she keep going? 'I don't know whether it was that I didn't allow myself to think of the possibility of losing, or whether it simply didn't cross my mind. I only know that I was convinced from a moral standpoint, and that I had a conviction that this was what I had to do, because I knew how upset my father would have been by what was going on.'</p> <p>To everyone's amazement, Kate and Christopher Rothko won, and the court issued a crushing verdict. The executors were thrown out for 'improvidence and waste verging on gross negligence'. Reis and Stamos, long-time friends of Mark Rothko, were found to have been in conflict of interest; as executors, they could not negotiate with the Marlborough because the company had both of them on its payroll. All contracts between the Marlborough and the Rothko estate were declared void, and the judge awarded damages of more than $9m against Frank Lloyd, the founder of Marlborough Fine Art, who had laundered art through myriad Liechtenstein holding companies, and the executors. </p> <p>Lee Krasner, swiftly eating her words, removed the estate of her husband, Jackson Pollock, from Marlborough's grasp, and others followed (though Marlborough Fine Art survives, even today). It was, Kate concedes, a magnificent victory - though Reis and Lloyd were, in spite of her best efforts, never punished in a criminal court for their actions. 'No, that's true. One had to make do with the satisfaction of seeing the paintings come back. The judge sat down with me several times [during the litigation] and asked me if I would make a settlement for money. But I always said no, because it wasn't about money.' Nor was it about ownership, or not in the private sense. Kate simply wanted to make sure that her father's wishes became a reality. </p> <p>Rothko may have been depressed at the end of his life, he may not have been as clear as he should have been when it came to writing a will; but with regard to his work, and where it might end up, he had long held strong views. While selling to private individuals from his studio, he would scrutinise their reactions to paintings; they had to pass a test they did not know they were taking. If they failed, they went home empty-handed, irrespective of the size of their wallets. Lighting, on which wall of a gallery a painting might hang; these things obsessed him. </p> <p>It was Marlborough's job to sell his work outside America, but so far as his legacy went, it was his wish that it should be seen by the public, and that groups of his paintings should stay together, like siblings. This was why, in the months before he died, he fell upon the idea of a Mark Rothko Foundation; this body, led by Reis, Stamos and Levine, would distribute his work to public galleries. The idea that individual works would disappear into the homes of millionaires was anathema to him.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the court did not rule on paintings that the Marlborough Gallery had already sold. 'We won, but so many didn't come back,' says Kate. 'We were too busy defending the judgment on appeal to go back and appeal for a better judgment. What I've found hardest over the years is looking at what didn't come back. It has been very... distressing. The most painful example I can give you is Homage to Matisse from 1954. It's the one painting I would really like to have; I grew up with it. I gather that it went into a vault somewhere for a number of years and then it came up for auction.' </p> <p>In 2005, the painting was sold by Christie's New York for $22.4m, a sum that was then a record for a postwar work. 'If something was offered to us in a non-auction situation, I suppose we might make a trade. But at auction, at these prices... no. It's impossible. I finally found out who owns it, and it's another collector, one who will probably never let it out of his private home.' </p> <p>Do collectors ever invite her to come and see the paintings in their homes? 'Rarely.' Nor are they inclined to make loans. 'I have written for loans on behalf of institutions, to give an extra nudge, but they are invariably refused. Ostensibly, it's because they love the painting so much. But one has to wonder: does price come into it? They are scared of damage, which is always a possibility. I can only say that when the first major retrospective took place in 1978, it was no problem to get loans; now it is increasingly difficult. I find it horrible that art is just another investment.' She laughs. 'No, I don't get invited into too many homes, and perhaps it's just as well because I would probably be very unhappy with the vase on the table in front of the painting.'</p> <p>Kate Rothko Prizel M D (she is a research pathologist) lives with her husband, an academic, and her youngest daughter in a big (but not vast) Colonial-style house in Washington. I'm sure, given what hangs on her walls, she has a good security system, but if so, it is unobtrusive; I've seen tiny terraces more fortified, and most of those probably contain only the odd David Hockney poster. What you notice immediately are not just the paintings, but the gaps: work, she tells me half-apologetically, is often on loan and, sometimes, when it comes back, the business of rehanging such large and fragile canvases gets put off - and off. </p> <p>I ask her how many paintings are still in the family. 'It's hard to put a number on things,' she says. 'We had to sell some things to pay legal fees. I can't say what we will have for ever. Christopher and I each have three children. It's clear to me that they care about the paintings, and would rather have them than cash. But there will be estate taxes one day, and here, giving to a museum does not credit towards your estate tax.'</p> <p>In the 1970s, it was Kate who was 'the point person' when galleries were putting together shows of her father's work, but these days that task falls mostly to Christopher, a psychologist who now works almost exclusively in the interests of the Rothko estate. Even so, Kate will be coming to London for the opening of Tate Modern's Rothko show, the first significant exhibition of his work to be held in Britain for more than 20 years. She is thrilled by the idea of this exhibition in particular because it is not a retrospective, but a unique gathering of Rothko's late work, including the Seagram Murals, originally commissioned to hang in the dining room of the Four Seasons Restaurant in New York, and several other series, including the very last he ever painted, known as Black on Grey. </p> <p>'Seeing these paintings standing alone may have a very different effect on the audience,' she says. 'This time, there will be no side-by-side comparisons with the bright works of the 1950s, and [thus] the audience will not have a tendency to see the darkening colours as representing a change in his mood. With retrospectives, there is often a feeling [as you approach the monochromatic late works] that this was the ultimate walk towards his suicide. But look at them in isolation, and instead you simply feel something opening up before him. I do not connect any feeling of frustration in him at this time with a frustration over where his work was going. I see these paintings as a new beginning for him rather than a reflection of his mood. </p> <p>'No one would deny that my father was very depressed towards the end of his life. I used to be very engrossed with that idea, too. There was a terrible tendency for me to see the paintings darkening, becoming less accessible emotionally, more hard-edged. I had a hard time separating them from his depression. But then I saw an exhibition at the Menil Collection in Houston, work that followed his completion of the paintings for the Rothko Chapel [commissioned by Dominique and Jean de Menil in the mid-1960s]. I hadn't been familiar with those works. It was a period when I wasn't in the studio a lot, and my father didn't have any at home. It was fascinating to see how those works had grown out of the chapel, and then how they led to the black and greys. That was the beginning of a whole new way of seeing for me.'</p> <p>When Rothko committed suicide, many of his friends thought it out of character. As the painter Hedda Sterne put it: 'Who was this man, Rothko, who killed my friend?' Was Kate surprised? 'I guess it was a shock. In one sense, it fit. I knew how depressed he was. But it still seemed so out of character - and then, he did not leave a note, which seemed even more out of character. He was a communicator, on paper and verbally. That seemed extremely strange. He'd been very ill [in 1968, Rothko had suffered an aneurysm, a result of his chronic high blood pressure]. When my mother told me what had happened on the phone, she did not tell me he had killed himself, and I presumed his death was due to one of the illnesses. So I was shocked.' </p> <p>What was her father like? 'Oh, this is always a difficult one! He was a very social person, very outgoing.' In biographies, Rothko, who was born in Dvinsk, in what is now Latvia, and who arrived on Ellis Island, New York, in 1913, is always portrayed as a determined socialist. That is why he disapproved of the Four Seasons restaurant, and why he eventually decided to keep the paintings he made for its walls and later to give them to the Tate. </p> <p>He also liked to make jokes about his peasant background. 'Well, part of that was just his humour. He liked to tell stories about his past. He was anything but a peasant. Education in the family went back three generations. He did remain close to his background. His family was never particularly supportive of his career, and didn't understand it, but there was always a weekly phonecall. He was pretty representative of immigrants of the time, in that he didn't retain his own language - I didn't even learn how to say yes or no in either Yiddish or Russian - but he would always go to the atlas and show me Latvia. He was a great storyteller. He used to tell me that he ice-skated to school. Knowing his athletic abilities, I suspect that was one thing he did not do.'</p> <p>Kate was interested in his work from early on. Her parents had received membership of the Museum of Modern Art as a baby-shower gift and, on Sundays - after Mell insisted that Rothko leave his studio for the day - the family would go there. Later, Kate remembers visiting Peggy Guggenheim, the great patron and collector, in Venice. 'She took us to Torcello in her motorboat. But the story I always tell is about how, when I was 16, I went cross-country with my father by train. His family lived on the West Coast, and my mother would fly with my brother because he was so young. What is so frustrating, looking back, is that I had three days with my father and, had I been three years older, I would have taken the opportunity to talk to him about his philosophy. But, of course, we both sat there, and for three days, neither one of us really knew what to say to the other. It was an awkward age for me, and I think he felt that awkwardness. I look back and I think: what wasted time!'</p> <p>Rothko's philosophy was, of course, complicated. He belonged to a generation of artists - his contemporaries included Pollock, Barnett Newman and Clyfford Still - who spent long periods in obscurity and poverty before they were discovered by the critics, at which point their prices rose - and rose. Perhaps this was why, post-1960, he found it so hard to accept his wealth. He paid cash for everything and, according to Robert Motherwell, if he had to go to the bank for any reason, he would slip into 'a depression as intense and prolonged as Kafka writing The Castle'. </p> <p>But it was also that he worried that money would distract from the work itself; he distrusted material success. He was, as Robert Hughes has written, 'one of the last artists in America to believe, with his entire being, that painting could carry the load of major meanings and possess the same comprehensive seriousness as the art of fresco in the 16th century or the novel in 19th-century Russia... his painting accumulated resonance by appealing to myth; but myths were in decline....' </p> <p>He was determined to think of himself as an outsider even as the riches and the praise - contemporary critics adored Rothko to the point of daffiness - heaped up at his studio door. Did these tensions - the sense you get from his work of a man waiting too long for an epiphany - contribute to his final depression, or was it also, as Lee Seldes suggests in her gripping book about the Rothko trial, that the artist knew that he had signed over too much to the Marlborough? His suicide took place on the same day that a representative from the gallery was due to visit Rothko's warehouse, to choose from the artist's hoard of paintings, something no one had ever done before (he liked to choose paintings for sale himself, and saw this visit, which he felt powerless to resist, as an invasion of privacy). </p> <p>Kate is in two minds. 'I felt it had never quite sunk in how famous he had become,' she says. 'But then, when Pop art and Op art came so hard on their heels [of the Abstract Expressionists], he felt that he had had only a tiny window of fame, and then what? I think he would have been shocked by what happened after he died because he was absolutely convinced the executors were his friends, and that they'd act in the best interests of the estate. Whether he knew what was going on with the gallery is less clear. He knew he was not... free. I suspect things were planned for a while before he died. It seemed like everything was in place. I can't say if those pressures contributed to his mood, but they would certainly seem to have helped.'</p> <p>Whatever lay behind her father's final destructive act, Kate hopes that Tate Modern's show will go some way to separating the work from the man, the paint from the biography. She would like people to see the late work as just that - late work - and to relish it for its own sake, the way we might the distinctive late bloom of any other artist, rather than regard it as a symptom of the dark clouds overhead. 'Even I have to step back from the biography at times,' she says. 'From my father as I knew him. Because, sometimes, that leads to misinterpretation.' </p> <p>For me, the late paintings stand, as much as anything, as a corrective to the earlier work, with its warming yellows and pinks. They remind you that what Rothko most feared and disdained - the idea that his work was regarded as decorative - is too narrow, or at least too easy, a way of seeing him. They are the apotheosis of the existential struggle that lies at the heart of all his work. </p> <p>And does his daughter still miss the man who gave us the paintings it has been her privilege to fight for, and to protect? I guess, thanks to his work, that her father lives on in a way that most people's parents do not. 'Yes. He does live on in that way. But the paintings are only one part of my father, and not the purely dad part. At family events, I still find myself thinking: I wish he could be here - though not, 38 years on, with the same tearfulness that I felt for... well, the first 20 years.'</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Rothko is at Tate Modern 26 Sep-1 Feb 2009. <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/tickets\">tate.org.uk/tickets</a></p> <h2>Rothko's life in brief</h2> <p><strong>1903 </strong>Marcus Rothkowitz is born in Latvia.

  "<p>As this paper's TV critic I daren't calculate how many hours I've spent in front of a television over the past nine years - it's both far too much and never quite enough. I'm still passionate about telly - as an advocate, a critic and a punter - and I think I've learnt quite a lot about the most powerful medium on the planet, but there's always more to know, so when I was recently given the opportunity to think inside the box for a change, I was intrigued. </p> <p>Very unexpectedly I landed a job which promised to take me out of my own occasional onscreen comfort zone - offering up the odd sound bite - and into the clutches of an awesome primetime-reality beast. I was slightly scared by the idea but, of course, this was outweighed by my curiosity. Anyway, it's not like I was going to be a contestant</p> <p>A couple of weeks ago at the Edinburgh TV Festival I watched a panel discuss celebrity culture - how and why our fascination with sleb trivia has taken a darker turn of late, post Britney and Amy Winehouse. Sharon Osbourne was insightful on how The Osbournes had worked brilliantly for her family but also how she feared for the (mostly) young women whose sole career aim is fame by any reality means necessary and sod the consequences.</p> <p>I'm endlessly fascinated by this subject and guiltily consume as many reality formats as I can bear, so the opportunity to see how it might work from within was seductive. And while I may not be a contestant, I still had to audition and have a bunch of people decide, somehow and for reasons only they know (and which I'd probably rather not), that my face fitted. Which is how I now find myself one of a panel of three judges on a C4 reality show presented by Gok Wan and Myleene Klass, coming to a screen near you soon - and without giving too much away, after only one day of filming I have had virtually all my preconceptions about reality TV pretzel-twisted. </p> <p>Around 9pm last Sunday, while in a heated off-camera debate with my (equally exhausted) fellow judges and the production team, it suddenly hit me: this wasn't merely an exercise in which I will get to find out what it's like to contribute to the most potent TV genre of the young and dumb 21st century, or simply have my ego tickled by the fact that I'm being treated fabulously by everybody with whom I come into contact, or even to find out if the celebrity presenters resemble their high-profile public personas (and they are, for the record, even lovelier). No, my light-bulb moment was suddenly realising that this discussion had ramifications above and beyond one small moment, that we three judges had been randomly gifted the power to change lives ... which seemed if not downright wrong then certainly faintly absurd. Suddenly this job - one for which my qualifications are negligible - felt like a big responsibility. The contestants are off on a thrilling voyage of self-discovery but, believe me, they're not the only ones who are learning fast. </p> <p>I arrived on set prepared to make a TV programme, but I hadn't anticipated the monumental amount of effort, generosity of spirit and, most surprising - especially for a journalist - complete lack of cynicism from the huge team which makes this show. The attention to detail is not, as I had assumed, solely about manufacturing something diverting for an 8pm slot on Channel 4 by any means necessary - it is genuinely about making this as life-enhancing an experience for the contestants as possible. I don't (yet) understand the motivation to bare souls and more besides in front of strangers and cameras, but I'm desperately keen to find out. </p> <p>It's a real privilege to work alongside people who appear to not only love television, but understand and respect its power. I love telly as a consumer, but since last Sunday I am learning to appreciate it in different ways as a participant. I really want our show (until yesterday I considered it to be somebody else's show) to be a fun, funny, warm, provocative, memorable, thought-provoking and intelligent piece of entertainment, ideally with a great big Happily Ever After at the end. Too much to expect? We'll see.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:kathryn.flett@observer.co.uk\">kathryn.flett@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>In 2003, the same year that he unveiled 'The Weather Project', his now legendary giant artificial sun that lit up the Turbine Hall at Tate Modern, Olafur Eliasson also created a much more intimately dramatic work of art. In a makeshift gallery at the Venice Biennale, he installed a white plastic drum that protruded from a wall with a red button on it that said 'PRESS'. Anyone who was brave or curious enough to press the button was startled seconds later by an intense flash of light from within the drum. For several minutes afterwards, each time the viewer blinked, the word 'UTOPIA' was imprinted on their retina. It was a work of art that literally made you see the world differently, and, as such, was both an illustration of and a metaphor for the Icelandic-born artist's methodology. Perhaps more than any other artist working today, Eliasson involves the viewer directly in the artworks he creates. 'My work is not about me,' he once said, 'it's about you.' </p> <p>'The Weather Project' was the most successful single work of contemporary art exhibited in Britain in recent years, attracting an astonishing two million viewers to Tate Modern. More interesting still was the way in which the audience interacted with the piece. Many visitors wandered slowly through the Turbine Hall as if determined to take it all in, while others lounged on the floor for hours like sunbathers. Some days the atmosphere turned celebratory as crowds of strangers interacted by arranging their bodies to spell out giant words that were reflected on the mirrored ceiling. When Tim Neuger, Eliasson's gallerist in Berlin, visited Tate Modern, a group of young people had spelt out the words 'Fuck Bush' on the ceiling. He rang Eliasson in Berlin and let him listen to the cheers of the crowd echoing though the Turbine Hall. </p> <p>You could say that Eliasson has reinvented the way in which conceptual art is received by the public, replacing the usual hushed reverence - or sighs of exasperation - with a mood of playful and anarchic mischief. 'I do not see my work as any kind of statement or a manifesto,' he says. 'It's a dialogue. Always.'</p> <p>Right now, that dialogue is continuing apace, and with equally dramatic results, in New York, where Eliasson has created a series of giant self-propelling waterfalls on the East River. Situated at four different points between Manhattan and Brooklyn, the '<a href=\"http://www.nycwaterfalls.org/#/about_the_waterfalls/Waterfall_Images\">New York City Waterfalls</a>' range in height from 90ft to 120ft, each pumping up to 35,000 gallons of water a minute up and over their giant frames. At night, they are illuminated, adding another level of surrealism to an otherwise drab stretch of the river. Eliasson's art attempts to make us see the everyday in a different light. 'In a way,' says Eliasson, 'I like to think that I have given New Yorkers back their river.'</p> <p>And they, in their turn, have responded in kind. On the online photograph site, Flickr, visitors have posted more than 5,000 snapshots of the waterfalls, a mass response that pleases Eliasson much more than the chorus of excited approval that greeted the project's unveiling in the American media. 'On Flickr, the photographs have been taken mainly on mobile phones, and often there are people in the photographs with the waterfalls,' he says. 'It's a highly subjective way of documenting the work. I see the waterfalls as a co-producer of the time and place in which they take place. I suppose, in that way, the work filters into questions about society and democracy.'</p> <p>This may indeed be the case, but it strikes me later, while perusing the images on Flickr, that the 'New York City Waterfalls' may also function as a kind of temporary tourist attraction that visitors pose in front of in much the same way that they pose in front of the iconic skyline or the Statue of Liberty further out in the harbour. In this way, Eliasson's artwork may well have slipped, like artworks have a tendency to do, out of the artist's control. </p> <p>And for Olafur Eliasson, art does seem in a very real way to be about control. He frets a lot about how his work is interpreted to the point where he often tries to undercut the media's tendency to report what he does as mere spectacle. Or, as he puts it, 'I have a team that includes lawyers, copyright specialists, press officers, all making sure that the values I think the work represents are navigated into the communication of the project throughout the process. In my practice, I try my best to avoid the experience of my work being formalised, standardised, generalised and rationalised. My work is about the opposite.'</p> <p>For someone who makes epic works of such sublime beauty - in itself quite a feat in an age when notions of the sublime in art sometimes seem as pass\u00e9 as pastels and watercolours - Eliasson is a doggedly serious, even earnest, young man. Talking to him about his art can be oddly exhausting. His mind, as his ambitious projects suggest, is in constant motion, one thought spiralling into another in ever-evolving circles of conceptual complexity. Like many installation artists, he has a tendency to theorise and his speech is littered with terms like 'duality' and 'collectivity', not to mention 'experiential'. He is the contemporary artist-as-boffin as well as architect, designer, philosopher and scientist. </p> <p>'If one were to look for precedents as to the way Olafur works,' says Hans Ulrich Obrist of the Serpentine Gallery in London, where the artist created a pavilion last summer, 'it would have to be Buckminster Fuller, the artist-as-inventor. He has that kind of enquiring approach where the art emerges out of collective studio operation that is essentially a laboratory of ideas.'</p> <p>To this end, Eliasson currently employs around 40 people in his Berlin studio, including architects and scientists as well as craftsmen and designers. It's all very Scandinavian, the notion of the unified aesthetic taken to conceptual extremes in the pursuit of art that is so ambitious in both its form and content that it engages the audience almost as much as it has engaged the minds of its creators. Before he installed his giant sun in Tate Modern, Eliasson's team constructed a small-scale version of the Turbine Hall, about 40ft long, in his studio so that they could wander through it and observe the effects.</p> <p>'It's certainly unusual the way that he embraces all these various backgrounds to his art,' continues Julia Peyton-Jones, director of the Serpentine Gallery. 'Olafur's work addresses architecture, design, science and philosophy, and he operates at a very serious level. Of course, he has quite a big support team, but essentially it's his mind and his ideas that drive all these artistic investigations and makes his art what it is.'</p> <p>I meet Eliasson in Copenhagen, where he has a big, bright, airy harbour-side office near the docks. He lives in the Danish capital with his wife and two adopted children when he is not working in Berlin, or flying around the world to oversee the various high-concept art projects he seems to be juggling at any given time. (In 1998, he had more than 60 artworks on show across the world.) Both his adopted son and daughter are Ethiopian, and he and his wife, the art historian Marianne Krogh Jensen, run a charity for Ethiopian orphans called <a href=\"http://www.121Ethiopia.org\">121Ethiopia.org</a>. Recently, he designed a kind of mini art installation in the form of a light projection that will greet visitors to every Louis Vuitton shop on the planet - there are over 300. All the money earned from the commission went directly to his charity fund. </p> <p>Currently, Eliasson is involved in an ambitious urban renewal project in Manhattan called the High Line and, earlier this summer he had a big retrospective of his work at MoMA. Alongside the architects Diller Scofidio+Renfro, he will help transform a mile-and-a-half stretch of disused elevated railway track into an elongated shopping mall with a park. Or, as the DS+R website puts it, 'a post-industrial instrument of leisure reflection'. You can see why Olafur gets along with them. </p> <p>For the past two-and-a-half years, he has also been working on what he calls his 'academy'. The vast new office-cum-studio space he has just purchased in Berlin was formerly a school and, when it is converted, will house up to 20 student-apprentices who, Bauhaus-style, will learn how to be artists by being on-site and contributing to the Eliasson laboratory of ideas. </p> <p>'Though all this is not related directly to making art, it is exciting and therapeutic,' he says, sounding genuinely enthused by the challenge. 'When you move studio, you can also optimise the values of the workplace. I can now give more space to the things that have turned out to be important and shed the less interesting things. A studio is not just a workspace but a little psychographic universe of the brain.'</p> <p>At 40, Eliasson still has the air of the brainiest boy at school about him, and his chic wardrobe and designer spectacles somehow accentuate his palpable sense of studiousness. He was born in Denmark though both his parents are from Iceland, where his father worked as a cook on a fishing boat and a part-time artist, and his mother as a dressmaker. Interestingly, both his grandparents were bohemians: his grandfather published avant-garde writing, while his grandmother was a photographer of some local repute, and hosted a salon where Reykjavik's scattered artistic community gathered to argue and swap ideas. 'I am not avant-garde at all,' says Eliasson. 'I do not want to be a spokesman or lead a movement. I am essentially a traditionalist.' </p> <p>Eliasson was four when his parents split up. A few years later, after his father moved back to Iceland, he began spending his summer holidays there with him. You sense that the country's elemental landscapes, strange sunlight and long shadows have had some deep and lasting effect on his creative psyche. As a teenager, he was a prolific drawer, specialising in anatomical sketches. By 14, he had also discovered breakdancing, which he seems to have embraced with the same fervour as he later pursued conceptual art. With his teenage posse, 'The Harlem Gun Crew', he toured Scandinavia, and even won the national break-dancing championship. Today, he is resolutely tight-lipped regarding his personal life, but recently he told the New Yorker that break-dancing 'really gave me a quite particular idea of space, and an obsession with how the body moves within that space'. </p> <p>The same article had also revealed that, in 1987, his grandfather had committed suicide and that, as part of his university application, Eliasson had submitted a piece of sculpture in the form of a black gravestone. </p> <p>He looks genuinely perturbed when I mention the New Yorker piece in passing. 'That was impossible for me. I mean, what was it about? And why on earth would anyone want to write a piece like that? The media do not know exactly how to verbalise something that does not anchor in the personal life of an artist. The music and fashion industry have promoted that idea for so long that it has become a model for how the media wants to address art.' He shrugs his shoulders and sighs. 'Also, I'm just not interesting enough to do that kind of profile on.'</p> <p>This is a refrain that echoes throughout our conversation, and suggests that the incredible success of 'The Weather Project' and the 'New York City Waterfalls' has brought in its wake a level of exposure that Eliasson is utterly uncomfortable with. Earlier, when the subject of the YBAs, and Tracey Emin in particular, had come up, he had said, 'Emin is the opposite of me. Merging her life and her artwork completely is her greatest success, but I do not have those social skills. I am much more mainstream and boring. I am an uninteresting person really. I try to let the work go out there and not to require me to be in front of it.'</p> <p>When I ask him who his formative influences were, he thinks for a moment, as if weighing up whether he should reveal them or not. Finally, he says, 'I started out being interested in the American west coast movement - Sol LeWitt, Donald Judd, Dan Flavin. Then, I came across the so-called land artists - Richard Long, Hamish Fulton.' </p> <p>Eliasson's willingness to make epic artworks in the open air, though, recalls the work of Christo, who, back in the Seventies and Eighties, famously wrapped huge public buildings in fabric. Initially, though, after graduating from the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, Eliasson expressed himself though photography: big Icelandic landscapes whose horizons and dimensions seemed askew. Soon, though, he moved into more ephemeral territory, using water, ice, steam and light in installations. In Venice, he also created the 'Yellow Room', which was lit by the kind of high-definition sodium lights that are used in Swiss motorway tunnels. He described, in his inimitable way, the experience of walking through it as 'hyper-seeing'. </p> <p>More dramatic still was his now legendary act of interventionist or guerrilla art, the 'Green River' project, which consisted of dyeing rivers in various cities bright green. Using industrial amounts of the same vegetable dye that Irish-American bars use to colour the beer on St Patrick's Day, Eliasson managed to change the colour - at least for a brief moment - of rivers in Tokyo, Los Angeles and Stockholm. The impulse, he says, was the same one that drove the Waterfalls project. 'It makes the water explicit. You see the river differently. It shows that the river is a bloody river and not a postcard.'</p> <p>Eliasson is quick to point out that, while the 'Green River' was 'an activist project', the 'New York City Waterfalls' is not. Does his work have an ecological agenda, as some have suggested? He sighs, but then concedes that this is an interesting question. </p> <p>'With \"The Weather Project\", I ask myself that question all the time. I did not anticipate the global warming issue as it is today, it was more an attempt to set up ideas that would constitute a platform for collectivity. But the weather has become politicised. So, interestingly, the world has changed and the reading of my work has changed with it, but the work itself hasn't changed.' </p> <p>He stares at my tape recorder for a long moment, as if lost in thought, then he says, 'One should be careful about only amplifying the ecological aspects of the waterfalls. I certainly don't consider myself an eco-warrior. Not at all. Talking about green power, that is for the brain. I'm not an intellectual artist, as you can see from my art. I make my work and then I talk about it. My work does not illustrate my ideas; my ideas try and support my work.' </p> <p>Nevertheless, this is a man who initially wanted the Turbine Hall in Tate Modern to accommodate a tropical rainstorm as well as a giant sun. For once, though, the mechanics could not support the idea. The 'New York City Waterfalls', it strikes me, may well be that idea transformed. Indeed, one could view Eliasson's entire output as one unified work-in-progress. </p> <p>'Olafur's process has to do with producing reality,' says Hans Ulrich Oberst, 'and that has taken him way beyond the exhibition space. He has an incredible sense of determination and a commitment to pursuing his ideas to see where they lead. With him, it's not so much about the destination but the journey itself.' </p> <p>Towards the end of our meeting, I ask Eliassson, who has grown visibly restless, if he ever finds the time to daydream or be bored? He looks momentarily startled. 'When I am bored, I start doubting whether I exist,' he replies, without irony. 'When I don't do anything, I feel I might disappear.' </p> <p>I ask him, in conclusion, if there might come a point when the bigness starts getting in the way of the art. 'Generally speaking, you are surely right,' he says, frowning and looking even more fretful, 'but one needs to challenge oneself and look deeper and ask oneself what role art has in society. To answer that question, one must take certain risks in order to reinvent what art can do. For me, the question is not how big or how small, but does the work succeed.'</p>",
  "<p>The Celeb Diaries follows Mark Frith's near 10 years at Heat magazine. When Frith took the helm in early 2000, the magazine blossomed from being a disastrous flop to a hugely popular icon of our times. His mission was to 'debunk celebrities, make people realise they're just like you or me'. If Posh has a pimple or Gwyneth Paltrow reveals a bristly armpit, you can chortle about it in Heat</p> <p>You soon get used to Frith's style of writing. Lots of 'Yeps!' and 'Bingos!' Indeed, you get so immersed in his world that when he describes a quote from Geri Halliwell as 'dynamite', you don't even question it. </p> <p>The Celeb Diaries aspires, in look and subject matter, to be like Piers Morgan's The Insider (but without the Class A celebs or the self-congratulatory tone). Young Mark is a tad more downmarket, and in the end seems to feel almost as contrite about his line of business as we, the hungry readers, feel reading it.</p> <p>What a job though. Imagine being able to stride into work on a Monday morning and shout, 'I want 25 pictures of celebs with cellulite on my table by lunchtime!' The 'bingo!' moments are good fun but given the somewhat exploitative nature of the beast I enjoyed the book most when things were going wrong for Frith. It's thrilling to hear how he sweated and squirmed on the phone to lawyers, or to witness his genuine dismay when Ewan McGregor describes Heat as a 'dirty piece of shit'. Go Ewan!</p> <p>In a celebrity-obsessed society, this is a fascinating document. Nostalgic, too: remember when Jade was in Big Brother and everyone loved her? Rebecca Loos? What a girl! Jude and the nanny? That was a good one. It is interesting to discover just how the stories are unearthed and the scandal of the week chosen, and to marvel about how inconsequential they all were. Being the editor of such a magazine, the arbiter of what shocks and what rocks us, is no easy task. Frith - part man, part Jack Russell - had the energy and tenacity to last almost a decade. Someone should give him a bone (or a celebrity carcass) as a reward.</p> <p>In the end it wasn't the pressure of the job that got to Frith but the ugly reality of celebs' lives: Britney in meltdown, images of Amy Winehouse in all her self- lacerated horror, and the reality of Mark Speight's fate. 'I was fed up of seeing pictures of tormented famous people,' he explains. We know how he feels.</p> <p>The final straw, though, is pleasingly lightweight. It was John Barrowman who pushed him over the edge. The team's idea for a photo session was to make Barrowman look like Tom Cruise in Cocktail. 'John is not a poor man's Tom Cruise. He is a rich man's John Barrowman,' sniffed the agent. 'That's it. I'm resigning. This is not Madonna, this is John bloody Barrowman!' cried Frith. He had created a monster and no mistake.</p> <p>Towards the end of the book the tone is surprisingly circumspect. 'The democratisation of fame has led to some of us going too far. When you see celebrities as your playthings ... how much do you play with them?' If the editor of Heat doesn't know the answer to that question, then who does?</p> <p>The Celeb Diaries provoked an unexpectedly schizophrenic response in this particular reader. Although I am a celeb of sorts myself, I am mercifully of a calibre not often troubled by the attentions of Heat or any of the other, shall we say 'fame-orientated' magazines. (A photographer jumped out from behind a tree in Regent's Park the other day to pap me, but his heart wasn't in it. After three snaps he stopped and asked me if I knew where Kate Moss lived. As if.)</p> <p>But even my lowly grading doesn't stop me feeling the hot glow of angry solidarity with Jude Law or Fern Britton when they have their privacy invaded, or when photos of their non-celeb relatives are published without their knowledge or consent. Yet, at the same time, I'm a punter at heart and my eye is drawn to a sordid headline or a shocking image as irresistibly as the next person's. I need my escapism too, and there is something brave and gloriously irreverent about a magazine genre that refuses to take itself or, more importantly, anyone else, too seriously.</p> <p>You might describe it as camp - this obsession with all things trivial and aesthetic. Heat expresses no interest in serious news, happy or sad. Indeed, after 9/11 they worried that they might be out of business. Piers Morgan declared: 'I hear secretaries talking about anthrax and al-Qaeda, not EastEnders.' He was wrong, of course, for as Frith points out, 'They were talking about anthrax and EastEnders.' Sales went up that week by several thousand copies. </p> <p>Statistics like this inevitably provoke hand-wringing, but there might be a more positive aspect to our appetites for celebrity disgrace. It does us the world of good to learn that our idols are flawed too, capable of wearing the wrong outfit, putting on weight, succumbing to temptation or just being plain unhappy like the rest of us. Most of all, Heat allows us to sympathise with the rich and famous - a whole new emotion. Sympathy is better and less painful than unrequited love or low-down envy. This may be Piers Morgan Lite, but if you've ever experienced the full-fat original, you'll know that may be no bad thing.</p>",
  "<p>Here is a modest proposal: hand this book to FTSE 100 chief executives, private equity partners and hedge-fund managers in lieu of their annual bonus. I know that's never going to happen, but let's hope some will read it before they bank their seven-figure cheques.</p> <p>The 'unjust rewards' of the title refers not only to the wealthy elite but to the poor, many of whom deserve better than the meagre wages and stunted life chances that are their lot in modern Britain. Birth, the authors argue, has become destiny. The predictive power of family background is greater than at any time since the Second World War; poverty has become a life sentence without parole.</p> <p>Toynbee and Walker dissect the justifications of astronomical pay advanced by the recipients, who have agreed to participate in a City focus group. Those at the airless summit of the earnings scale are so stricken with money myopia they can barely believe most people make less than \u00a340,000 a year, and are utterly nonplussed as to how anyone can survive in London on a mere \u00a3100,000. Yet they are keen to commandeer the moral high ground, suggesting they work harder and aim higher than nurses or teachers: after all, they have school fees to consider.</p> <p>As the authors note, spending on offspring is seen as a trump card, as if it 'were automatically moral and good'. </p> <p>Participants in the focus group are unlikely ever to cross paths with Alison Murray, one of 766,000 single mothers in the UK living on income support. She is a member of one of the most reviled groups in society, but she has been put in that position because she fell in love, got married and had babies. Her husband turned out to be violent and financially irresponsible, which would have been awful for a middle-class or wealthy wife, but not necessarily the full-scale disaster it has been for Alison.</p> <p>'The rest of us, moneyed and/or lucky,' Toynbee and Walker write, 'may gamble, drink, choose a disastrous partner, fall into debt, behave badly or get pregnant unintentionally (most women do at some time). Friends forgive our faults, sympathise and accept that most people blunder sometimes. The mistakes of the poor make them society's problems, and the way they are then targeted for moral obloquy is one of the greatest inequalities of all.'</p> <p>What really stood out for me was the book's hopeful side: the goodness and decency that stand against coarseness and greed. The ranks of the rich include intelligent people who want a fairer system: Sir Philip Hampton, chairman of J Sainsbury, is mentioned, and I could name others. A Middle England focus group, initially lacking insight into the lives of the poor, shifted their views when they learned more, stating that they would be prepared to pay 2p more in the pound in tax to provide a Sure Start children's centre in every neighbourhood. We learn about dedicated individuals, such as Faruk Noor of charity Tomorrow's People, who counsels the unemployed for depression. We also hear about the strength of the family in poor communities, resilient matrilineal constellations of grandmother, mother and children. Alison survives thanks to her mother, who buys her food claiming the items are 'on special', reducing her daughter to tears of gratitude.</p> <p>The great strength of this book is not so much in the remedies it suggests, some of which are controversial, but in its appeal to the reader's imagination, sense of fairness and common humanity. In these credit-crunched times, there are all kinds of financial deficit in the City, but perhaps the deficit of imagination over how the other 99.99 per cent lives is the most damaging of all. It's enough to make you campaign for Asbos for the rich.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Ruth Sunderland is Business Editor of The Observer</p>",
  "<p><strong>The dilemma</strong> I broke up with a girlfriend of four years a few months back because she was without doubt the most jealous woman I have ever met, and it was getting worse. (Although I never told her this, to spare her feelings - she is quite sensitive underneath the tough exterior.) She seems to have not let go and continues to tell everyone we are still together and are only taking time out. Things took on a darker note a week ago when I went for lunch with a colleague of mine and afterwards she told me that she had received several threatening phone calls from a woman. I'm fairly sure it was my ex. Tell me what to do: am I being paranoid or overreacting, because I'm afraid of this escalating</p> <p><strong>Mariella</strong> You clearly need to have a full and frank discussion with your ex, but humour me a little first. Let's talk about one of the most corrosive emotions to afflict any relationship, as you discovered - jealousy. Whether it's justified or imagined, the green-eyed monster is a very scary beast indeed. I've seen it cow perfect relationships into submission and destroy a few of my own along the way. </p> <p>Like acne, jealousy is most frequently found and certainly only acceptable in youth, though it's all but guaranteed to exist at terrifying levels not only in adolescent but early adult relationships, too. There can be few of us who emerged from our twenties without at some time or other succumbing to the insidious, debilitating and incredibly destructive effects of imagined, potential or, worst of all, proven infidelities. Happily, the latter tends to be the least likely scenario of the three. </p> <p>When you're caught in its steely grip, jealousy seems the perfectly rational side-effect of true passion. You're in love, which is a risky business, and therefore you must protect your territory as though it were the last oil field on earth. There are many things wrong with that theory - not least the notion that love is something you can claim possession of and then keep hold of by ring fencing it from any other potential takers. Nobody ever stuck around solely because you managed to eradicate all temptation. The most accomplished control freak in the universe couldn't protect a relationship for an entire lifetime. If anything, the partnerships who enjoy long-term success tend to be those where the connecting fibres are surprisingly lax. I'm not talking about that flawed utopian ideal of the open relationship, rather that when two adults allow expectations of decency and respect to dictate their behaviour (rather than their psychotic subconscious), things tend to go more smoothly. </p> <p>If you're unfortunate enough to end up with a strayer, there is no security system on earth that will keep them faithful - and only heartbreak ahead for the partner who makes it their life mission to cling on. With that in mind there is nothing less dignified than an adult man or woman displaying the symptoms of irrational jealousy. If you're so afraid your partner is going to stray that you need to scare off any adult who appeals, then there is either something very wrong with you or with your relationship. Maturity leads most rational adults to the conclusion that jealousy is not an indication of the depth of feeling involved or an emotion to be coveted. Rather it's as clear an indication that things are awry as incessant arguing or a complete absence of physical contact. </p> <p>For the sake of one's pride alone, jealousy is worth eradicating from the equation. To spend the little time you have consumed by the terrible dread that you are about to lose everything you love in ghastly circumstances is no way to lead a fulfilling life. </p> <p>The jealousy sufferer is always on the wrong foot, too. Either they are imagining infidelities where none exists - which makes them the weaker partner, vulnerable and ultimately en route to destroying their relationship - or their fear is based on real betrayal, and equally unhelpful. Jealousy doesn't make you strong, angry or better able to deal with a cheating partner; it makes you insecure, bitter and stressed. </p> <p>So to you and your potential bunny-boiling ex. I'm unclear why you spared her feelings when you broke up: most people would far rather be given a tangible cause for being chucked than the banal 'It's not working'. You need to tell her, in no uncertain terms, that her jealousy poisoned your relationship and will ruin her life until she gets a grip.

  "<h2>The Case Study</h2> <p>Hey, I strike you as that kind of guy, right?' It is an early morning in late August and Morgan Spurlock, documentary film-maker, the man who in his breakthrough film, Super Size Me, pushed his body to the absolute brink by dining on nothing but McDonald's for a month, unleashes the first of many manly laughs. Less than 24 hours earlier he was at the Democratic National Convention, where he attended a Rock the Vote party, plugged his new film, Where in the World is Osama bin Laden? and - as Record Doctor is none too surprised to learn - listened to his current favourite band the Hold Steady for the duration of the plane journey home.</p> <p>'For me,' he says, listing the quintet's qualities, 'it's all about the lyrics, the music, the structure; the way that he [frontman Craig Finn] writes songs that tell stories which hark back to old songwriting styles. They're just... awesome.'</p> <p>'Awesome' is a word that crops up a lot when talking with the New York-based 37-year-old. NERD, and especially Pharrell, are 'pretty awesome'. Cypress Hill are 'awesome'. The Sex Pistols too. He's equally fond of 'blew up' and 'busted out', making Spurlock sound like an improbable amalgam of bubbly, backslapping revolutionary ('Do I like music with \"fuck you\" qualities? Oh absolutely!') and all-American perpetual adolescent. Tellingly, Foreigner soundtracked his early teens.</p> <p>'They were a big band for me. Come on,' he says, detecting a note of disbelief in Record Doctor's voice, 'when you hear \"Jukebox Hero\" and \"Hot Blooded\", how can you not be excited?' None the less, they proved to be a major disappointment when in Tennessee, in 1984, he saw them on their Agent Provocateur tour. 'It was all (sings), \"I wanna know what love is\", with' - he adopts a tone of utter disgust - 'this huge, like, choir behind them. I'd have loved to have seen them in 1980 when they were all strung out and rocking.'</p> <p>Spurlock derives his love of hard-rocking bands from his two brothers, particularly the eldest, a Black Sabbath/Led Zep aficionado. This was unusual in West Virginia, where everyone loved country including Spurlock's father. Especially his father. Spurlock, though, loathed it.</p> <p>'It felt like nails down a chalkboard to me. My dad would get into his car, put some country on and sing along, a cigarette in his mouth, and I'd be like (shouts), \"C'mon! Kill me! Enough already!\"' And then, in his late teens, he moved away from home. 'Something changes when you go out into the world - things open up. Now I love Willie Nelson and Merle Haggard. Awesome.'</p> <p>Spurlock has undergone several conversions since, aged eight, frequenting a Dr Hook concert ('I was so excited just to, like, be there'). He bought his first single when 'I was nine or 10' - Rick James's 'Super Freak', a huge hit with his mum. Hall and Oates followed along with Foreigner before, after flirting with Metallica and hip hop ('I remember when it first busted out'), the Red Hot Chili Peppers and 'protest music', he acquired a slot on college radio in New York. </p> <p>'And that's when I got turned on to this whole other world, all these great English groups - the Smiths, XTC and the Stone Roses.' He became smitten, too, with a fellow student, a fan of a band of whom he'd never heard: REM. 'I'll be thankful to her for ever for introducing me to them,' he says, trying, fruitlessly, to remember the album that functioned as his portal into Michael Stipe's world. 'I can recall hearing him [Stipe] for the first time and thinking that he didn't sound like anyone else I'd been turned on to before.'</p> <p>Since then music has changed immeasurably, he says, largely for the better - thanks to the internet. 'Suddenly you're finding out about some guy in Kansas making music in his garage whom no one had ever heard of before. And there's something very special about that.' Not so the way in which music is now consumed. 'Remember when albums would come out and you and your friends would sit around and listen together?' He sighs and recounts his introduction to the Pistols' 'Anarchy in the UK' and Cypress Hill's self-titled debut set. 'I miss that,' he says, momentarily sombre. 'A shared music experience is beautiful.'</p> <p>He didn't feel that way, mind, when a few weeks ago he went with a pal to an avant-garde gig. 'Someone was banging on a pot while someone in the background went (makes ghost-like noise), \"Woooh ooohh ooohh!\" I said to my friend: \"If you ever invite me to anything like this again, I will kill you.\"'</p> <p>While he has little interest in banging on a pot, Spurlock is learning, slowly, to play the banjo. Very, very slowly. He has owned one for two years.</p> <p>'I've got this series of albums called Pickin' On - bluegrass versions of rock classics. Have I mastered any?' He laughs. 'No. I've just mastered keeping it in the closet and not practising. But if I do... well,' he says, 'that would be pretty awesome.'</p> <h2>The Symptoms - his favourites </h2> <p><strong>Metallica </strong><br><strong>Last Caress </strong>(Elektra)</p> <p>'This song has soundtracked many moments of angst and inspiration in my life. I love music that can both transport me back and push me forward at the same time. And it still kicks ass.'</p> <p><strong>Johnny Cash </strong><br><strong>Folsom Prison Blues </strong>(Columbia)</p> <p>'He's the Man in Black, enough said. The first rebel of rock'n'roll and someone who marched to his own tune all the way to the end. And anyone who can write a line like \"I shot a man in Reno, just to watch him die\" is someone worth listening to.'</p> <p><strong>.38 Special </strong><br><strong>Hold on Loosely </strong>(A&amp;M) </p> <p>'Whenever I hear this song, I crank up the stereo and rock out. What can I say? You can take the boy out of West Virginia, but you can't take West Virginia out of the boy.'</p> <p><strong>Louis Armstrong </strong><br><strong>Do Nothin' Till You Hear From Me </strong>(Universal Classics)</p> <p>'I got turned on to Satchmo as a child and have loved him ever since. He was the reason I wanted to play trumpet at 13 and he always makes me smile. If I was stranded on an island, I'd want a collection of his music. It is timeless.'</p> <h2>The Diagnosis</h2> <p>The Patient's first purchase was Rick James's 'Super Freak'. Would Meshell Ndegeocello's 'I'm Diggin' You (Like an Old Soul Record)' revive memories of his foray into funk? </p> <p>Rilo Kiley's Jenny Lewis is no conventional country balladeer, but her solo work, as evidenced by 'Rise Up With Fists!', is flavoured with elements of the South. In contrast, The Week That Was ('The Airport Line') could not be more English, their stately pop perfect, on paper at least, for a sometime Anglophile.</p> <p>REM are, perhaps, the Patient's favourite band and, on the strength of 'Revolution (in the Summertime)', they are Cosmic Rough Riders' favourite band too.</p> <p>Among the qualities that the Patient admires is an aversion to timidity and Julian Cope's 'All the Blowing Themselves Up Motherfuckers (Will Realise the Minute They Die That They Were Suckers)' is brave, unquestionably, if inflammatory.</p> <p>Finally, while the Patient undoubtedly adheres to John Lennon's maxim, 'avant-garde is French for bullshit', he might feel differently about CocoRosie whose 'K-Hole', crucially, is goth-folk with a tune.</p> <h2>The Cure</h2> <p>Julian Cope has been called a lot of things in his life, among them 'nutbag' and 'headwear obsessive'. To the Patient's mind, though, he is a 'genius'.</p> <p>'I have become a huge fan of the Brian Jonestown Massacre and when I hear this track, it's easy to see the road that was paved for them by people like Cope.'</p> <p>His other big favourites were the Cosmic Rough Riders, whose album 'I bought right after I heard this. I love guitar-wielding troubadours from the past and this track is at the crossroad of old and new.'</p> <p>The Patient was already au fait with Jenny Lewis, having become a 'recent convert' on the strength of an appearance on TV in the States. 'I love voices like hers, plus the lyrics are fantastic.'</p> <p>The Patient knew all about Meshell Ndegeocello, too, but while 'I like her stuff, and if I were dancing in a club I would seriously get my funk on, I wouldn't rush out to buy this'.</p> <p>Neither would he invest in The Week That Was ('It's as if Toto had been reincarnated. I loved Toto; this not so much'), while CocoRosie, sadly, left him scratching his head. 'Actually being in the k-hole may increase listening pleasure, I think.'</p>",
  "<p>We haven't been driving around the outskirts of Memphis for too long before Seasick Steve spots a neighbourhood he thinks he recognises. Something about the weather-beaten houses set back off the dusty road is tugging at his memory.</p> <p>'Most everything has changed round these parts but this place looks familiar,' he says, sounding suddenly excited. A little further along, we crest a hill and a silver grain silo looms up behind a tall wire fence and suddenly we're at a railroad crossing. Up ahead, a wooden sign in the shape of an x says, 'Prospect'. All the while, Seasick Steve is bouncing up and down on his seat and whooping with delight like a child. </p> <p>'Goddamn!' he shouts, jumping out of his pick-up. 'This place ain't hardly changed a bit since I used to come down here and try and hop a freight train going north.' </p> <p>We walk along the tracks for a bit, over a concrete bridge that straddles a dank, dark stretch of river. In one direction, there is nothing but railroad track stretching off to infinity; in the other, maybe 200 yards away, there's a big freight train, way over 16 coaches long, stationary and silent. Seasick Steve is pacing up and down the track in his jeans and braces, check shirt and workman's boots, and pulling at his grey hobo beard. He looks lit up, excited. 'Whoooee!' he shouts. 'Ain't that something? It's like they knew we was coming and they ordered us up a train!' </p> <p>A few minutes later, as if on cue, the freight train shudders to life and comes rolling up the track real slow. It judders to a halt right in front of us, and a switchman jumps off the engine and gets to work on the tracks with his lever. Then, the train grinds into action once more, and Seasick Steve is shouting, 'You hear that! Whoaaah! Yes indeed!', and it's as if he is hearing the past unfolding. </p> <p>As the train rolls by, wagon by wagon, he points at one carriage where there is a flat, steel platform on the back. 'See that? Right there! That's where you hop the train as it's moving slow out of the yard and then you gotta lie low till you're out of the neck of the yard and hope the bulls [railroad police] don't see you. Then, you're gone, man! Straight to Chicago or Chattanooga or wherever that train's gonna take you.' </p> <p>He stands staring after the freight train as it disappears into the distance. You can tell he would like to be on board, hunkering down between the wagons. Then he turns to me and says: 'Don't you see, man? You can jump up on one of those and you're gone! Outta here. Someplace else. For free!' I nod, but what the hell do I know about that kind of freedom or the hardship that attends it? All I have to go on is what I've glimpsed in the songs of Woody Guthrie, Jimmie Rodgers, Boxcar Willie and their unlikely successor, this rough and tumble character standing before me on the dusty tracks he once stalked like a ghost, and now stalks again, 40 years later, in song. </p> <p>Back in the pick-up, still excited, he starts singing softly. It's a song called 'Prospect Lane' from his new album, I Started Out With Nothin' and I Still Got Most of it Left. A song that was born right here on this train track leading out of Memphis, Tennessee, maybe 40 years ago, and has taken all this time to come to life. </p> <p>'I got my ear down to the ground<br>Listening for the rumbling sound,<br>Deliver me from this town,<br>Today, I'm gonna be homeward bound<br>Whoaa, waiting for the train,<br>Today, yesterday, it's just the same<br>Down at the end of Prospect Lane...'</p> <p>The following night, after we have driven down Highway 61, past acres of raggedy corn where there were once only fields of cotton for as far as the eye could see, and we are holed up in the Shack Up Inn on the other side of Clarksdale, Mississippi, drinking cold beer and fighting a losing battle with some badass mosquitoes, I finally ask Seasick Steve how he felt down there by the tracks. He shakes his head and sighs. </p> <p>'Kinda melancholy is how I felt,' he says, his hoarse, weather-beaten voice no more than a whisper. 'So much stuff don't look the same any more, but that place did. So, it was strange, man. Exciting, but kind of melancholy too.' He falls silent for a moment or two. 'I guess I miss it, that old freedom,' he says, finally, 'but I don't want to retrace it too much 'cept in the songs. You can't relive the past, man. Can't go back there. You go back a day later and it's changed. Forty years later and it's like a dream you once had.'</p> <p><strong>Forty years ago, Seasick Steve was a hobo whose </strong>constant wandering brought him down here to the Deep South more than once. At 13, he had fled his home in Oakland, California, on the run from a violent stepfather who, in a fit of rage, had thrown him though the window of his mother's house. 'I had a moment of revelation,' he says. 'It was like I had been pushed right to the edge by what was happening to me, and I knew I was going to have to kill that motherfucker. Then, I suddenly thought: \"No, Steve, it don't have to be like that. You don't have to end up in jail for one reckless act.\" It suddenly hit me that there was another way out. I could just run, and keep running. That way, at least my life would be my own.'</p> <p>Back then, Memphis was the hub of the South, a place where you could hop a train to almost any town in America. Some of the giant train yards still remain: The Tennessee Yard, The Burlington Northern Yard, The Johnston Yard. But like the city itself, the railroad is but a shadow of its former self, a repository of memories for anyone old enough to remember a time when, as a nostalgic Tom Waits once told me, 'everywhere you went in America, there seemed to be a train crossing.'</p> <p>Back then, Seasick Steve was plain Steve Wold from Oakland, California, and it was music not trains that he was chasing. One of his earliest memories is of his father playing boogie-woogie piano, Pinetop Perkins-style. 'Got a picture of me, just two years old, sitting on the old man's knee while he played the boogie,' he says, a sad smile on his grizzled face. 'My dad loved that shit and I guess he passed some of it on to me.'</p> <p>The shack we are sitting in is part of a themed blues bed and breakfast set-up owned by two Mississippi hippies called Guy and Bill, but it once belonged to the old Hopson Cotton Plantation, where Pinetop Perkins worked. In one of the adjacent shacks, Pinetop taught the young Ike Turner to play the piano. Further on up the road is Clarksdale where, legend has it, Robert Johnson supposedly sold his soul to the devil down at the crossroads at midnight. It's also where Sam Cooke was born, and where the great Bessie Smith died after a car crash out on Highway 61. </p> <p>'I came down here as a young feller looking for the blues, but I didn't find them,' says Seasick Steve, laughing and taking a swig from a small bottle of Tennessee bourbon. 'Wasn't in Clarksdale but an hour before a big, old redneck policeman ran me right out of town again. That was how it was back then, and there were some places hereabouts you just didn't go if you were a hobo. No sir. But, I love it down here. It's where it all starts. Charlie Patton, Son House, Mississippi Fred McDowell, ol' Pinetop, they all hail from round here. Right here where we're staying, the atmosphere is so thick with old ghosts that I get almost drunk when I breathe the air.' </p> <p>You can hear some Mississippi ghosts in Seasick Steve's music, too, in the raggedy thrust of his old-fashioned songs, in the broken down swagger of his playing. Down the road in Como lives his old friend Sherman Cooper, 'a pack rat with a house full of junk'. A few years back, Sherman gave Seasick Steve an old three-string guitar that he'd picked up somewhere and nailed to the wall as an ornament of sorts. When Seasick Steve's wife Elizabeth saw it for the first time, she said: 'That guitar is going to make you famous.' Steve laughed, and he's still laughing now - all the way to the bank. </p> <p>The Three-String Trance Wonder, as it is now called, has since become his trademark. Likewise the One-Stringed Diddley Bow, basically a plank with a single string, which was made for him by another eccentric local musician, James 'Super Chikan' Johnson. Then there's the Mississippi Drum Machine, which is basically a wooden box for stomping time on. Steve has customised it with a piece of carpet and a Mississippi license plate. He's a showman as well as a storyteller, and someone who is acutely aware of the power of his own mythology, and how it has to be maintained.</p> <p>'I like to keep things kind of rough and basic,' he says. 'That's what the young kids like. They're tired of being sold all this smoothed-out, cleaned-up shit. In a way, my music's kind of like a punk. Old, smelly, punk.' </p> <p>Seasick Steve's late success has surprised no one more than himself, and he tells me more than once that he doesn't really expect it to last but he's going to try to make himself 'some real money' while it does. Though both his songs and his persona trade heavily on his hobo credentials, he actually turned his back on the road way back in 1973. 'It just got too damn hard,' he says, 'and I knew if I kept on, I'd end up dead in a ditch somewhere.' The trajectory of his life since then is hazy and, one suspects, he plays down the semi-settled years, sensing correctly that his mainly young audience prefer the myth to the reality. </p> <p>For the past 35 years, he has worked, on and off, in the music business, both as a hired session musician and as a studio engineer. Along the way, he has played with Joni Mitchell and, when he lived for a while in Olympia, near Seattle, in the late Eighties, helped produce albums for 'damn near every grunge group in America'. Though he has been married to his second wife for 27 years, and has five grown-up sons, Steve has had some trouble putting down roots in one place. 'I'm a settled hobo' is how he puts it, adding that he and his wife have lived in 59 different houses to date. They are currently based in Norfolk, which, he assures me, 'is a whole lot more exciting than Norway'.</p> <p><strong>It was in the Norwegian town of Notodden, however,</strong> that he found himself living four years ago. There he started recording a bunch of songs on a four-track tape machine. He was recovering from a heart attack that had left him feeling 'hopeless and helpless', and tells me he 'didn't have no big plans for the songs 'cept for giving them to my wife'. </p> <p>The results found their way to his old friend, Joe Cushley, a DJ on internet radio station Resonance FM, who passed them on to the small British independent label, Bronzerat Records. Towards the tail end of 2006, Seasick Steve got a call from the BBC, who wanted him to appear on Later... with Jools Holland. Though he had no idea who Jools Holland was, he was persuaded to perform one song, 'Doghouse Boogie', on his New Year's Eve Hootenanny. It caused a stir in the studio, and an even bigger one online. A few days later, Seasick Steve's website collapsed under the weight of several thousand hits. The most unlikeliest cult star of the Noughties was born: an ex-itinerant pensioner who played the shit out of a three-stringed guitar miked up with gaffer tape. </p> <p>'I was shocked, man,' he says now, laughing his big throaty laugh and tugging on that long beard. 'It wasn't a good performance. I couldn't see nobody, couldn't hear nobody. I just threw my old guitar down at the finish in frustration. Then, all hell broke loose.'</p> <p>After the Jools Holland show, Seasick Steve, suddenly found himself in demand. He played a series of festivals across Europe, and his first record, Doghouse Music, started selling well. In 2007, he won a Mojo magazine award for Best Breakthrough Act. The weekend before we met, he had gone down a storm at the Reading Festival, playing to 65,000 people, all of whom seemed to be singing along. He is just about to embark on a sold-out tour of Britain. </p> <p>'I still have a moment every day where I have to stop and take stock of what's happened and I still ain't figured it out,' he says. 'I got people coming up to me all the time in England. Young girls getting fresh! It's weird, man, them girls just see a star, they don't see an old guy.'</p> <p>It says something about the times we live in that Seasick Steve has managed to slip, mostly by word-of-mouth success, through into the mainstream. In doing so, he has become a hero to a generation for whom the word 'hobo' is about as meaningless as the word 'blues'. What they see in him is something that's long gone, something they can only ever experience vicariously through the rough energy of his songs. </p> <p>Refreshingly, the object of their devotion doesn't give a hoot about 'authenticity', and rejects the loaded term 'blues singer' outright. 'I'm an entertainer,' he says. 'I tell stories but my stories are real. I give 100 per cent of myself every time I walk onto a stage. Don't matter if it's 10 people or 10,000, I want to make them remember me.'</p> <p>Seasick Steve is cagey about his actual age, but looks like he might be hitting 70. If his new album makes it into the charts, which it may well do given the seemingly unstoppable momentum of his success, he will be the most unlikely pop star of the download and digital age. 'Imagine if I had to pitch myself to a record label boss,' he says, laughing. 'It'd be like, \"OK, here's the deal. I'm gonna play old time country-blues on this here piece of shit guitar and I gonna be a pop star.\" He gonna be reaching for the phone straightaway. \"Can you take this old guy outside. He smells.\"'</p> <p><strong>Over at Warner Music, though, the corporate</strong> marketing machine has rolled into gear behind Seasick Steve's new album, secure in the knowledge that he is already a cult figure on the verge of breakthrough status. 'They put some serious pressure on me to use a regular producer,' says Steve. 'They even had this feller, Youth, lined up, but I said no. I want to make it the way I hear it.'</p> <p>One of the best songs on the album, 'Just Like a King', features Grinderman, Nick Cave's other band. 'I asked Nick to write a verse,' says Steve, 'and he just looked out the window, twirled his chair for a few minutes, then started writing. It's a damn good verse, too.' More affecting still is the autobiographical blues ballad, 'My Youth', which, though just a fragment of a song, mines a whole seam of sadness and regret that many of his more rambunctious songs do not touch on. 'I got my memories,' he sings, over a lonesome slide guitar, 'and that's something no one can steal.'</p> <p>A few months ago, he tells me, he hopped a train from Nashville to Chattanooga and back 'just for the hell of it'. How did that feel? 'Kinda peaceful. I got on and it was just like before. The only difference is there ain't nobody doing it any more. I asked an engineer if he'd ever seen any hobos. He said, \"No, but a friend of mine has a book about 'em.\" He'd been working the railroad for 10 years, never seen one. Ain't that something?' </p> <p>The second night we spend in Mississippi, to the surprise of a handful of guests, Seasick Steve plays an impromptu set in a big barn at the Shack Up Inn. He is joined on stage by two young local blues musicians, guitarist Lightning Malcolm and drummer Cedric Burnside, son of Calvin Jackson, and grandson of the legendary Mississippi guitarist, RL Burnside. The show is intriguing on many levels. The three musicians have never played together before, nor have they even rehearsed, but there is some serious chemistry between them all the same, and the show smoulders and eventually ignites, delighting an audience of about 20 people. Throughout, Cedric has a smile on his face that's as wide as the Mississippi, but Malcolm watches Seasick Steve like a hawk, following wherever he leads. It's the blues, all right, but not as we have come to know it.</p> <p>'We knew what we was doin' from the moment we started,' Seasick Steve tells me later. 'We didn't talk too much about it, but I knew they was going to get it. It's an understanding. I guess you'd call that the blues. Way I see it, you can call it whatever the hell you want, long as people listenin' to it. Hell, there was a time back there when there weren't nobody listenin'. Seemed like every time I picked up a guitar, I could clear the room in seconds flat. I guess you keep at it long enough, the world eventually comes around to your way of thinking.' </p> <h2>Kings of the Road: Those hobo hit-makers</h2> <p>Seasick Steve is a self-declared hobo - a term whose etymology is far from clear but which refers to the subculture of itinerant railroad riders who proliferated in America from the end of the Civil War in 1865 through until the Great Depression of the 1930s and beyond. Figures who at some point counted themselves as hobos include author Jack London, boxer Jack Dempsey and the film star Robert Mitchum.</p> <p>Celebrated hobo musicians have included Woody Guthrie, composer Harry Partch, rockabilly pioneer Johnny Burnette, country singer Boxcar Willie (real name: Lecil Travis Martin) and folk singer Utah Phillips (who died earlier this year). Chief among the canon of hobo songs must be Roger Miller's 1965 hit 'King of the Road', subsequently covered by everyone from Elvis Presley to Boney M and Rufus Wainwright. There is also Bob Dylan's 'I Am a Lonesome Hobo', 'Only a Hobo' and 'Ramblin' Gamblin' Willie', Captain Beefheart's 'Hobo Chang Ba', John Lee Hooker's 'Hobo Blues' and 'The Hobo' and Paul Simon's 'Papa Hobo', as well as the Doobie Brothers' 'Long Train Runnin\" and even Jethro Tull's 'Aqualung'.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Seasick Steve's new album I Started Out With Nothin' and I Still Got Most of it Left (Warner) is released on 29 September. He plays the Royal Albert Hall, London SW7 on 1 October and tours the UK thereafter.</p>",
  "<p>As a panacea for defeat in the first Old Firm match of the season, a comprehensive victory at a traditionally difficult place like Motherwell would have been entirely satisfactory to those Celtic supporters who watched their team give one of their best displays of this year. </p> <p>The irresistible surges of a first half in which they built a 4-0 lead thanks to two goals from Georgios Samaras and one each from Scott McDonald and Shaun Maloney left the home side looking likely to face utter humiliation. But Motherwell's comeback, with goals from John Sutton and David Clarkson, brought them respectability and threatened, briefly, to bring about a minor miracle. </p> <p>Gordon Strachan's changes to the Celtic team amounted to punitive action against those who had performed so poorly against Rangers two weeks ago, but he could not have imagined the newcomers could effect such a transformation. There was a sharpness and commitment about Celtic from the opening seconds and, in that respect, expectations could not have been more spectacularly fulfilled. </p> <p>The restoration of McDonald to the attack, the introduction of the young Spaniard Marc Crosas to midfield and the recall of Lee Naylor to left-back, with Mark Wilson moving to his more comfortable role on the right, seemed to galvanise the champions. </p> <p>Motherwell were made to look like trees as the green and white shirts breezed past, the ball under control, the space opening up and the exploitation of the opportunities utterly ruthless. For a team whose morale was supposedly on the point of disintegration after the defeat by Rangers, Celtic were strikingly ebullient. </p> <p>Usually a difficult venue, Fir Park, on this occasion, proved to be a soft touch, perhaps, in part, because of the new playing surface, which has rid the stadium of its reputation as the home of the most damaged, and least accommodating, pitch in the country. </p> <p>Samaras and Scott Brown certainly could not have moved more smoothly as they combined down the right for the series of passes that would bring the opening goal. Brown finished the sequence with a low cross to the far side of the six-yard box, where Maloney, quite isolated, left-footed the ball into the unprotected net. </p> <p>Samaras would deliver the first of his goals when he received McDonald's pass, brushed past two defenders and slid the ball low past Graeme Smith with his left foot. McDonald provided the third when he received a throw-in from Wilson on the right, quickly turned and hit a brilliantly controlled volley, with the outside of his right foot, high past Smith. </p> <p>Celtic's dazzling movement was typified by the fourth goal. Naylor moved down the left and played the ball forward to McDonald, who back-heeled it into the path of Samaras. The towering Greek, moving at top speed, took the pass in his stride, covered another 20 yards and drilled the ball, right-footed, low to the left of the goalkeeper. </p> <p>In the circumstances, Motherwell's second-half performance could be called astounding. There was renewed vigour about their work from the start and the goals they produced, in a two-minute period soon after the restart, were the least their efforts deserved. </p> <p>There seemed to be no major threat when Clarkson lobbed the ball into the Celtic area, but it broke to Sutton, who hit a right-foot volley powerfully and low to the left of Artur Boruc. </p> <p>Stephen Hughes, the most creative of the Motherwell midfield players, then played a through-ball to Clarkson, who beat Gary Caldwell and Boruc in the chase, stretched out his right leg and slid the ball past the goalkeeper from 10 yards out.</p>",
  "<p>Gianfranco Zola has promised to try to deliver as a manager as much entertainment - along with some of the success - as he did as a player, and there was plenty for him to admire from his new team in this rousing match.</p> <p>West Ham were a goal down before Zola had a chance to settle into his seat in the directors' box. Then they lost Dean Ashton, whose run of injuries shows no sign of coming to an end after he was forced off early on with an ear wound that required six stitches.</p> <p>The response was commendable and arguably merited some reward. But in the end it was Tony Mowbray celebrating on the touchline as Albion recorded their first victory, after a stuttering start to the season, with a tremendous late winner from Chris Brunt.</p> <p>Zola had a quick, consoling word with his players afterwards. Caretaker manager Kevin Keen, who now waits to see what the future holds for him, said: 'He thought we were unlucky not to get something. It was disappointing for the players, who put so much into the match. Their reaction to going behind so early and to the loss of Dean was great. The most disappointing thing was conceding a goal so soon after we had gone ahead.'</p> <p>Keen kept his counsel on that penalty conceded by goalkeeper Robert Green, but maintained: 'Robert is as honest as they come and he insists he got the ball.'</p> <p>Mowbray was delighted with the points, which he feared his side would struggle to collect when injuries to Abdoulaye M\u00e9\u00eft\u00e9 and Gianni Zuiverloon and a debut for \u00a3800,000 signing Jonas Olsson from NEC Nijmegen meant a major defensive reshuffle.</p> <p>'There were some good points, but other areas where we must improve,' said Mowbray. 'We have to control matches more. This gets us up and running. Now let's see whether we can go on and get into the pack.'</p> <p>James Morrison beat Matthew Upson to head West Brom in front from a cross by record signing Borja Valero on his home debut. West Ham, with Herita Ilunga on loan from Toulouse making a solid debut at left-back and David Di Michele, on loan from Torino, doing well when replacing Ashton, levelled when Calum Davenport crossed to the far post for Di Michele to head goalwards. Scott Carson pushed the ball out and Mark Noble put it back in.</p> <p>It got better for them, Upson knocking down a corner for Lucas Neill to fire home off Morrison on the goalline. But two minutes later Lee Probert ruled that Green had brought down Leon Barnett and Roman Bednar converted the resulting penalty.</p> <p>The cut and thrust continued. Carlton Cole turned Olsson and sent Luis Boa Morte in on goal, but Carson stood up well to block his near-post shot. Then, Green went down at the feet of Bednar to prevent West Brom regaining the lead.</p> <p>The decisive goal was good enough to win any match. Albion broke from defence through Robert Koren and Paul Robinson and the finish by Brunt, low into the far corner when under pressure, did justice to the build-up.</p> <p>West Ham were not finished and it needed a save by Carson to deny Scott Parker, who nevertheless will be kicking himself for placing his effort from close range too near the keeper. </p> <p><strong>THE FANS' PLAYER RATINGS AND VERDICT</strong><br><strong><br>Terry Wills, Baggies@yahoogroups.com</strong></p> <p>Boing! Boing! Boing! I know nine out of 10 reports will be about West Ham and Zola, but this was a very entertaining game that we just about deserved to win in the end. The atmosphere was tremendous and the football, at times, was brilliant from both teams. A goal after two minutes always helps and we played some tremendous attacking football in the first 25 minutes. It was a shock to go 2-1 down, but the penalty came at the right time and from then on, it was an open game. The fans aren't too happy with Mowbray's 4-5-1, but it worked today and put both us and the players in good spirits for Sunday's game against the Villa.<br><strong><br>The fan's player ratings</strong> Carson 6; Hoefkens 6, Olsson 8, Barnett 5, Robinson 6; Morrison 6 (Kim 5), Valero 6 (Moore 5), Koren 7, Greening 6, Brunt 5; Bednar 6 (Cech n/a)</p> <p><strong>Tim Conlan, Observer reader</strong></p> <p>It was a cracking game that could have gone either way. When we went 2-1 up I thought there was no way we were going to lose, but they got a dubious penalty and in the second half it was end-to-end. Overall we paid for a lack of pace at the back and this shows that selling Anton Ferdinand was pure folly. On the plus side, Ilunga was our best player and Behrami and Boa Morte were a threat, although I don't know why Kevin Keen took them off. I'm looking forward to Zola taking over now. I'm pleased with his appointment and I think he will get more out of the players and help attract others to the club.<br><strong><br>The fan's player ratings</strong> Green 7; Neill 6, Davenport 5, Upson 6, Ilunga 8; Behrami 8 (Faubert 5), Parker 7, Noble 7, Boa Morte 7 (Etherington n/a); Cole 6, Ashton 6 (Di Michele 4)<br><em><strong><br>To take part in the fans' verdict, email<br>fans@observer.co.uk</strong></em></p>",
  "<p>The last time Paul Jewell took charge of a side against Sheffield United before yesterday he was hot managerial property, a 2-1 victory at Bramall Lane securing Wigan Athletic's Premier League status on the final day of the 2006-07 season. </p> <p>How times change. After resigning his post the following day, citing the need for a break from the game, Jewell resurfaced six months later as manager of Derby, 2-1 winners over Sheffield United last night. At the time, County had gone eight games without a win, something that was expected to change once Jewell took the helm and got things sorted out. The common consensus was that it might take a few matches, such was the dent in morale around Pride Park, but a victory was surely imminent. No one in their right minds, and that includes the press, believed Derby's long-suffering supporters would still be waiting 28 league games later.</p> <p>In that time, Jewell's stock has fallen faster than the price of your average house. Losing in the Premier League to the likes of Manchester United and Chelsea is one thing. Losing in the Championship to teams such as Doncaster and Barnsley is another. Fail to beat Sheffield United here and it would have been a full year since Derby had experienced the taste of victory, their last three points coming at home to Newcastle on 17 September 2007. </p> <p>Back then Sam Allardyce was in the away dugout, Gordon Brown was popular and you could still go on holiday without worrying about your tour operator going bust. Times change, but at least you could always count on Derby to be consistent. </p> <p>It is hard not to feel sorry for the likeable Jewell, linked with a string of top jobs following his departure from Wigan, including that of managing the Republic of Ireland. He insists he is more than up to the task of reviving Derby from the mother of all slumps. 'I am a better manager now than I was 12 months ago,' he maintained last Friday. 'I am a better manager now than when I got to a cup final with Wigan, because of the experience I have had.' </p> <p>However, that's not necessarily a view shared by County's followers. 'What else can he say?' said one season-ticket holder outside the main reception area before kick-off. 'He can't go, \"I'm a worse manager and I haven't a clue how we're going to pull out of this\", can he?'</p> <p>'To start with, it wasn't his team so you couldn't really blame him for some of the results we were getting,' added another supporter. 'But now he's brought in something like 20 players, so the excuses start wearing thin. You can't be unlucky for 36 games. The thing is, I'm not convinced that replacing the manager is the answer. We've done that enough times before. But it does come to a point where you have to say enough is enough.' </p> <p>Irrespective of who is to blame - the players, the manager, the burger sellers around Pride Park - you cannot point a finger at Derby's fans, who have continued to support their team in numbers home and away. There were few spare seats around the place for last night's M1 derby, even though the game was live on Sky. Crowds have yet to dip below 27,000 this season. </p> <p>The home supporters chanted with feeling before United defender Matthew Kilgallon scored an own goal to give them a 21st-minute lead and after Darius Henderson had headed the visitors level almost immediately. You need patience to follow a club without a league win in almost a year and Derby's foot soldiers have it in spades.</p> <p>When Kilgallon felled Rob Hulse inside the penalty area in the 56th minute, referee Chris Foy awarded a spot-kick before over-ruling his own decision, having consulted a lineman. It really did seem as though the Gods were conspiring against Derby and Jewell, the Liverpudlian exploding with rage over a perceived injustice. </p> <p>Yet luck evened itself out 15 minutes later. Hulse appeared to use his hand to control a cross by Jordan Stewart before slamming the ball past Paddy Kenny, sending his former club to defeat, with Foy waving away United's fierce protests.</p> <p>The final stages were played out before thousands of people holding their heads, chewing nails, whistling, looking at the floor and chanting. No one, take note one or two Premier League-style supporters, left early. The final whistle, when it eventually came, was greeted by the kind of ecstatic scenes you see at cup finals, not an early season second-tier game. Still, who can blame them? They enjoyed their moment - and then some. </p> <p>'It's just such a relief,' admitted Jewell. 'The manner of the win especially impressed me, the way we came back from the penalty being awarded and then taken away from us to score a winner. It's a good feeling.'</p>",
  "<p>A gleaming black-and-white Fender Stratocaster is an unusual item to find in a soldier's kit bag, but for Sergeant John Dobbins it is one of his most treasured possessions. This isn't just any shop-bought axe. Dobbins built his guitar from scratch using parts he bought off eBay and had shipped to his base in Iraq. 'My friends thought I was retarded,' says the 22-year-old who spent 27 months in the war zone. 'I mean, there's no electricity and no amplification there.'</p> <p>Many soldiers take acoustic guitars to Iraq, but in the heat and humidity the wood soon splits. Because of their solid bodies, electric guitars are less susceptible to the weather. 'I built it piece by piece when I wasn't out on missions,' explains Dobbins, who has the calm air and physical presence of a man twice his age. 'I look at other guitars in the store and they're all shiny, but I like mine better because I built it myself.' To solve the amplification problem he bought an Eighties Fender amp and an effects peddle.</p> <p>During his first deployment, Dobbins had become fast friends with another soldier, Kenny Rojas, with whom he shared a passion for playing the guitar. Rojas would often come to his quarters to borrow his old acoustic guitar or talk music and Dobbins would work on his playing, emulating his heroes, Stevie Ray Vaughan and Eric Clapton his black-and-white Fender is based on one he once saw Clapton play on a music DVD.</p> <p>Today, with Dobbins gently strumming his guitar in his small flat outside Savannah, Georgia, where he lives with his wife, a former retail manager from New York, and their two labradors, which must be locked in cages in the kitchen before we enter (one has a tendency to pee everywhere in excitement), the war seems very far away. But the memories are still painful.</p> <p>'We were getting run ragged,' Dobbins had explained earlier as we sat in a shabby sandwich joint outside the gates of Fort Stewart, a vast military base an hour's drive from Savannah. The remnants of tropical storm Fay were playing out in bursts of heavy rain which lashed the parking lot where he had parked his customised Mustang (white and black, like his guitar) while inside a soldier played a videogame, shooting zombies in the corner. Over the counter hung a sign offering a Soldier Sub packed with meat and cheese and 10 per cent off for all military personnel in uniform. Dobbins had ignored his sandwich, his small grey eyes locked on a point somewhere in the middle distance as he recalled the night his friend Rojas had died.</p> <p>'We'd been getting two to three hours sleep a night,' he said, 'and one night in October 2005 when we were supposed to have the night off I took some sleeping pills. Before I went to bed I felt drunk because the medicine was taking over and I went to sleep. But three hours later they came and shook me awake because they needed a Humvee driver.'</p> <p>After protesting that he was in no fit state to drive, Dobbins was ordered into his vehicle, donned his night-vision goggles and roared out of the compound, the third in a convoy en route to intercept some high-value targets. As he left he recalls one of the medics joking, 'Don't hit anything tonight, Dobbins!' A short time later, the rear nearside wheel dropped into a pothole detonating a double stack of landmines. The armoured vehicle erupted in a blinding flash of white light and the next thing Dobbins knew he was waking on the roadside with bruising to 90 per cent of his body, one ear damaged and the Humvee in flames beside him.</p> <p>'My whole body was numb. I got up and limped towards the Humvee. A colleague was circling with blood dripping from his face. I shouted but he didn't react and I really thought I was a ghost. I thought I was dead.' In the mangled wreckage lay the body of his best friend. 'I didn't know there was anyone back there. He wasn't meant to be there.' They were both rushed back to the base and Dobbins remembers fighting off the doctors who were trying to give him morphine, desperate to know of Rojas's fate. 'I guess he died slightly after midnight.'</p> <p>With his friend gone and the memories still raw, Dobbins picked up his guitar and started playing, releasing his emotions, grieving. At that time he thought about something his godmother had said when he was in his teens and struggling to cope with problems in his family: 'People need music; it helps you get through your day.'</p> <p>'I'm still going to see a therapist,' he tells me quietly, 'still trying to deal with it. And I just play. Music's a big release for me; I just pick up a guitar and start playing. If I'm angry or sad I just feel better playing guitar.'</p> <p>Conflict is no stranger to creative endeavour. The First World War produced great poetry, the Spanish Civil War great literature, and in Iraq a vast number of young soldiers - brought up on videogames, free music downloads, YouTube and dubbed Generation Kill by Rolling Stone magazine - are turning to music as a way of making sense of their war. Everyone has an iPod or CD player and laptops and video cameras are common. Humvees are routinely jerry-rigged with tinny speakers and even sub-woofers, zip-tied to the ceiling, which pump out rock music as units charge into battle. And because you now don't need expensive equipment or a professional studio to record music, these soldiers, armed with just a microphone and a copy of home-recording software such as GarageBand, can produce a song in the combat zone and email it home.</p> <p>When he returned from his own tour of duty in Iraq in January 2006, Sean Gilfillan - who lost seven of his friends and comrades - was shocked at what he calls 'the disconnect between civilians and returning members of the military.'</p> <p>'If you didn't want to know about the war in Iraq,' says Gilfillan, who was part of the first occupying force to enter Baghdad after the fall of the city in 2003, 'you could ignore it. Only 9 per cent of the US population has any experience of serving in the military. The other 91 per cent have no idea.' In an attempt to bridge this gap and humanise the soldiers, Gilfillan decided to set up a label to put out music made by members of the US armed forces as a tribute to their fallen comrades and to reach out to the general population.</p> <p>To The Fallen Records was founded in January 2007 by Gilfillan and business partner Sidney DeMello and takes its name from the large tattoo Gilfillan had etched across his back to honour his friends who had died. The label offers a conduit of expression for young men and women whose voices are never normally heard in an attempt to expunge the stereotype of the typical American soldier.</p> <p>The pair acquired 'debt up to our eyeballs' to get their project off the ground, explains Gilfillan, and are now looking for a second round of venture capital and a pairing with a major label to help expand and get the music out to more people. 'We're a non-profit organisation in everything but name,' he says. 'We feel that the American public is ready to hear from these talented musicians, but we need a major label partner to make that happen.'</p> <p>There is certainly a vast pool of talent keen to embrace the label. The fledgling imprint now has a database of 1,500 military artists (unusually, the label is not just about releasing the best music, but providing a platform for all soldiers who want advice or guidance with their music) and has worked with more than 50 performers to put out three compilation albums - Hip-Hop Vol 1 , Rock Vol 1 (on which Dobbins's song, 'Tribute to the Fallen', about his friend Rojas appears) and Country Vol 1. They now plan to release further mix CDs that cover every genre.</p> <p>The response from the top brass has also been encouraging. 'The military bosses love it,' says the 29-year-old Gilfillan. 'They really see the benefit of the soldiers expressing themselves as long as they do it professionally and not offensively. It's good for the image of the military and they realise they can't censor soldiers who are fighting for freedom of expression.' A number of acts were recently invited to play at the Pentagon where, as one put it, they were 'treated like movie stars', and although no plans are in place for them to return to Iraq to entertain the troops, it's something Gilfillan would like to see happen.</p> <p>'Music is all about social issues, about grassroots, about authenticity and nothing is more grassroots, authentic and patriotic than music by members of the military,' says Gilfillan. 'One of the hardest things about being in Iraq or Afghanistan is that when a friend is killed you have to go out the next day to the same spot. You don't get a break. It can take a heavy toll on you and you have to deal with that at some point. I think music in this situation can be very therapeutic.'</p> <p>Josh Revak, 27, a former sergeant with the 1st Armoured Division who fought in Baghdad, Falluja, Karbala and Ramadi, is one of Gilfillan's artists with a song on the Country Vol 1 compilation - 'Empty Boots'. He has also released an album - In the Hours of Darkness - under the moniker Crutchhiker, which he recorded with the Grand Ole Opry house band. It's a moving record that touches on the transitory nature of life and asks big questions about the greater plan for us all in a bitter, raw and emotionally charged style. Revak's experience is a testament to the role music can play in war.</p> <p>In 2003 he and a friend wrote a song in Baghdad when a friend called Tim Hayslett was killed. 'We were devastated, absolutely crushed,' he explains, 'and when the sergeant major heard we'd written a song he asked us to perform it at the memorial service.' The difference between this service and previous memorials was clear. 'Soldiers were weeping, they were venting and grieving,' says Revak. 'Previous memorials had been dry-eyed and professional, which is not a word that I'd like to associate with a memorial service. You need to grieve or you'll lose your mind and I believe that the music helped with post-traumatic stress disorder.'</p> <p>After that first performance, the sergeant major effectively ordered Revak to play at every subsequent memorial. His moving, deeply personal songs provided a conduit for the soldiers' grief. 'It was hard because we knew we'd have to write and perform these songs, but we didn't know who'd be killed next. It was very stressful. Each time it was a closer friend.'</p> <p>During his second deployment, Revak would often sit in his unit's postroom writing and recording songs with his best friend Aaron Jagger. They played all of the memorials together, sharing the burden of songwriting duties. Then, one morning while providing armoured support to a team building a combat outpost in Ramadi, Revak and another colleague came under mortar fire.</p> <p>'We had got to a rendezvous point and everyone was out of the vehicles,' recalls the blond Revak sitting in the Veterans of Foreign Wars post (VFW, an American organisation similar to the Royal British Legion) near his home in Minnesota. He had been out late the night before, singing around a campfire at a friend's party and he's hungover and wearing mirrored shades, his voice cracking as he talks. 'A mortar round fell about 100 yards away and my friend and I decided to get back into our vehicle. As we were doing so a second mortar round fell on the other side of the vehicle. My friend didn't make it and I took shrapnel through my ankle. The doctor said he could see right through it.'</p> <p>Revak was shipped out to the military hospital at Landstuhl, Germany, where his unit was based and Jagger arranged the delivery of his guitar as he had surgery to rebuild his shattered ankle using bone grafts from his pelvis. While he was in hospital another friend was killed and then, just as he was leaving to begin a year-long rehabilitation as an outpatient, news arrived that Jagger, his best friend and companion at all those memorial services, had also been killed. 'He was an amazing musician,' says Revak, choking up at the memory. 'His was the last memorial service I played and writing and singing that song for him is the hardest thing I've ever had to do. I was crushed. I really miss him.'</p> <p>Although it was a particularly painful experience, today Revak looks back gratefully at his performances at these memorials. 'I've met a lot of Vietnam veterans,' he says, looking about the run-down interior of his VFW post, which is lined with flags, a poster advertising a meat raffle and, sitting at the bar beneath a sign stating that vulgar language will not be tolerated, a veteran who has headphones on and is swearing loudly to himself before being told to turn it down. 'I knew I didn't want any feelings locked up. I want it all out. These songs I hold dear to my heart. Performing them was beneficial to me and those around me.'</p> <p>In the gloomy basement of an old wooden house in Chicago that he shares with his young wife Josseline, Isaiah Santopoalo is standing before a large US flag pinned to the brickwork. Beside him is a microphone and in the corner his computer gently hums, its screen emitting a pale glow. This is his recording studio where the clean-cut, dark-haired Santopoalo recorded his hip-hop tracks covering everything from the lot of struggling single mothers to turning away from the temptations of Chicago street life; to a song called 'Moving On' which came out of his first deployment to Iraq.</p> <p>Santopoalo saw fierce fighting with the 5/73rd Cavalry of the 82nd Airborne in the battle of Turki village, near Baquba, about 30 miles north-east of Baghdad in the murderous Sunni Triangle in 2006. He lost close friends and although he was officially released from the military in February 2008, he is still going to counselling and occasionally suffers flashbacks. 'I have good days and I have bad days,' he says quietly.</p> <p>Although just 24, Santopoalo has been involved in some of the key events of recent US history. He joined the army just two weeks before the attack on the Twin Towers and was later posted to New York. Then, in 2005, he was in New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina before his deployment to Iraq. Through it all he carried his love of music, which had been fostered by his stepfather, also a former member of the 82nd Airborne, from the age of around 12.</p> <p>He played Beatles and Prince records oldies were goodies, says Santopoalo, who remembers seeing his fathers medals and donning his old fatigues to go and play at soldiers in the woods. Upstairs are display cases full of his fathers Beatles memorabilia. I'd sit and listen to his music all night through headphones, rewinding and trying to recite the lyrics. On the streets of Chicago he developed a love of hip hop the Roots, DMX and particularly Bone Thugs-N-Harmony spoke to him and he started emulating his rap heroes. It made me look at my life and think about how I could express it.</p> <p>In the army, Santopoalo held on to his love of music, dreaming up lyrics for raps while on patrol, sitting on sentry duty or manning his .50-calibre gun, saving up the lines until he was somewhere safe where he could jot down his songs. He would gather his colleagues round and free-style as he'd seen Bone Thugs-N-Harmony do in a video when he was younger. He spent most of his time on his two deployments in Iraq out in the field, far from Camp Warhorse, the nearest forward operating base, often engaging insurgents in action. But during those rare hours back in the relative safety of base hed make use of the satellite phones to call one of his collaborators back in Chicago to rap lines down the phone and request a beat. Over time these long-distance songs took shape and during one brief visit to the camp he signed up for a talent show.</p> <p>It was the first time Id ever performed and I was extremely nervous, he says, but I popped on the mix and did the song and got rave reviews. Not only did he have a touch of stage fright but, as the stage was lit up, the performers were worried about being mortared. But once the music started that all pretty much went out the window and everybody was focused on the stage. Its probably the closest Ill ever be to stardom, he jokes. All the girls were coming up to me afterwards asking where I stay. I did a few more songs and ended up scheduling a full-blown concert.</p> <p>Earlier this month officials met in Ramadi, once a hotbed of insurgent activity about 70 miles west of Baghdad where Santopoalo had fought, to hand over control of the vast eastern Anbar province to the Iraqi authorities. As America prepares to go to the polls in November, talk about phased withdrawals of troops becomes ever louder.</p> <p>Meanwhile, for these soldiers who, by their own admission, are still piecing together their lives and readjusting to civilian life, politics a once distant and academic business is now very relevant. Politics mattered to us in Iraq, says Santopoalo. 'We'd hear McCain or Bush talking about how the surge was working and many of the guys would discuss who they thought was telling the truth. In the end, unfortunately, you're faced with the decisions politicians make.'</p> <p>'As a label, we are non-partisan', says Gilfillan. We wouldn't have anything that is overwhelmingly anti-right wing or anti-left wing, but everyone has their view and is allowed to express it through their music and many of the soldiers you'll hear are pro-military but anti-war.'</p> <p>'McCain wants to go back to Iraq,' says Dobbins, 'and I don't.' Santopoalo has had his eyes opened to how much of the world perceives America. 'I think were a spoiled society,' he says wearily. 'To come home and hear people complaining about the most minute things waiting in line, not having enough hot water is very disconcerting.' He sees Obama as the one man able to rebuild the country's image in the rest of the world.</p> <p>Revak, however, has gone in a different direction. He had never paid much attention to politics until he started meeting Vietnam veterans who had been prisoners of war with John McCain, who was due in town the following week for the Republican National Convention. 'When I got back to the US I started to pay pretty close attention to the presidential race. I met Leo Thorsness and Dave Wheat who had both been PoWs with McCain and I started to learn about what had happened. After talking to these guys, it became real, not just a political campaign.'</p> <p>He says the final straw came when Obama cancelled a visit to meet wounded soldiers at the hospital in Landstuhl where hed received treatment. Obama had been advised by the Pentagon not to go, but, says Revak, 'It really started to upset me.'</p> <p>Revak also has fond memories of the Iraqi people. 'It was great to get out, me and my buddy dancing with Iraqis in the city square in full uniform.' Music was a way of connecting with the Iraqi soldiers they worked alongside and the Iraqi people they met. And wherever they went, Michael Jackson was a firm favourite.</p> <p>But music also soundtracked the war. There was pumping rock music to fire up the soldiers before they drove into battle and, as Dobbins says, 'It'd be a big thing for us all to prepare the playlist together before we went out a bit like in the film Blade where the girl puts together a playlist before going out to kill vampires.' Santopoalo, however, drew the line at actually listening to music while fighting: 'The battle was the music.'</p> <p>At other times there was a more personal soundtrack. 'There's a group of songs that remind me of my time in Iraq in the same way there are songs that remind me of college,' says Gilfillan, now a captain in the US Army Reserves and running the label full-time. 'When my friend Rob died, I remember listening to songs over and over again I listened to \"Mad World\" by Gary Jules and when I hear that now, I think about Rob.'</p> <p>Music has taken on a transcendental purpose now for these former soldiers. 'Before I'd write comedies, funny love songs. They were terrible,' says Revak, laughing. 'But in the military, music took on a whole new meaning. I've always loved playing, but I've never been any good until now. Nothing mattered until I wrote about life and death.'</p> <h2>Sgt.

  "<p><strong>Las Vegas, 23 July 2008</strong></p> <p>Late morning in Henderson, the nice suburban neighbourhood Brandon Flowers calls home, and the Killers frontman is in his kitchen. He is, as is his wont, fretting. He has to leave soon for another day's work at the band's new recording studio. This is in an anonymous Las Vegas industrial space, about a 15-minute drive from where each of the four members of the band live: Flowers, Dave Keuning (the guitarist), Mark Stoermer (bass), Ronnie Vannucci (drums). Battle Born they have called it, following the motto on their state flag, a reference to Nevada joining the Union side during the American Civil War. </p> <p>'It's exciting to branch out. We were talking about the studio maybe being a business venture, hiring it out,' says Flowers. 'It's been great to go in and not have to worry about who's listening.' As the Killers work on their third album, a record that has to top everything they've done before - otherwise the super-zealous Flowers might as well just give up - privacy is paramount. They recorded its predecessor, 2006's Sam's Town, in a studio inside the Palms Casino Resort, one of Vegas's ritziest joints. 'And it's great not to worry about who's going to pop in because they're gambling and they're a high-roller and they want to see the fucking studio.' As befits a man of religious faith, Flowers doesn't swear much. So when he does you get a real measure of his exasperation. 'Playboy bunnies too!' Family man Flowers didn't like that either. 'There was all craziness at the Palms. So now, definitely we're more productive.'</p> <p>The Killers are America's oddest successful act: four members who look like they should be in four different groups; working-class kids from heartland America - rather than the cosmopolitan coasts - with a love of flamboyance. Committed lovers of Eighties British pop (as evidenced on their first album, Hot Fuss) turned stadium-rock rabble-rousers who dug Bruce Springsteen and the Wild West on the follow-up, Sam's Town</p> <p>Alongside their joyous disco and rock anthems sit dark songs about trauma, salvation and death: 'Uncle Jonny' dealt with Flowers's cocaine-crazed relative's conviction that aliens were after his sperm (so he tried to shoot his testicles off); 'Bling (Confession of a King)' told how Flowers's father recanted alcoholism and Catholicism to become a Mormon.</p> <p>The singer's love of the Morrissey B-side 'Sister I'm a Poet' led to the writing of the band's 'Murder Trilogy' - 'Jenny Was a Friend of Mine', 'Midnight Show' and 'Leave the Bourbon on the Shelf'. Flowers ploughed this macabre route more deeply with 'Where is She?', inspired by the murder of a 14-year-old Scottish girl, Jodi Jones, by her goth boyfriend in 2003. Flowers wrote the song from the viewpoint of the victim's mother, not stopping to think of the upset this might cause.</p> <p>Oh yes. At 27, Flowers is five years younger than his bandmates and the oddest of them all. Lovely, but odd. Phobic about flying, and about the number 621 (his birthday is 21 June). Like his parents and siblings, a Mormon. A young husband and the father to a 13-month-old son, Ammon. Thoughtful and considerate, but also a control freak. An arch-patriot who doesn't seem sure of his politics. He was once quoted as saying he was 'sympathetic to George Bush' and when I'm with him, he mentions approvingly a recent copy of Newsweek which bore the headline 'What Bush Did Right'. But he recently retracted that earlier quote, saying 'I'm in the middle with my beliefs, like everyone else' and to me he talks enthusiastically about Barack Obama.</p> <p>And he's ambitious. Flowers wants the Killers' name in big lights, for ever and ever, amen. And he'll put in the micro-managing effort to achieve what it takes.</p> <p>'Brandon will turn in 14-hour days, day after day after day,' Stuart Price says admiringly. The Reading-born musician and producer (previous bands: Les Rhythmes Digitales, Zoot Woman; previous clients: Madonna, Seal) has become, in some ways, the fifth member of the Killers. He did the 'Thin White Duke' remix of 'Mr Brightside' that the band loved so much. Then, as exploratory recordings, he produced 'Leave the Bourbon on the Shelf' and 'Sweet Talk', which appeared on last November's B-sides-and-more compilation Sawdust. The band had tried and failed to record 'Sweet Talk' for Sam's Town.</p> <p>Price and the Killers clicked. On his first visit to Price's home studio in London, lifelong Anglophile Flowers noted the pictures of David Bowie and Brian Eno on the wall. 'I knew we'd found our man,' recalls Flowers. Now Price is working with them on the follow-up to Sam's Town and Sawdust, and to Hot Fuss before them. Together those albums have sold 12m copies worldwide, helping make the Killers - as one US magazine had it - America's Best British Band. Quick-paced computer whizz Price, the son of two classical pianists, has proved a great foil for Flowers. 'It's in him like it's in us,' says the singer. 'Brandon's meticulous over things and really works at it,' says the producer. 'He's one of those people where it's in his blood. It's a real admirable quality.'</p> <p>But in Las Vegas, even 14-hour days aren't enough right now. Flowers, with whom most of the band's songs begin, is agonising over a couple of unfinished numbers.</p> <p>Actually, right now he's happier talking about clothes. He's the perfect age to be a Nirvana kid but Flowers hated grunge, in part because it was so dowdy, partly 'because it sucked the fun out of things'. His teenage love of British music was heard through a prism of style: Echo &amp; the Bunnymen's trenchcoats, Morrissey's flowers, Bowie's chameleonism, Pet Shop Boys' sartorial wit, Oasis's post-football casual swagger. 'I almost follow the music through fashion.' </p> <p>Thus the Killers were dandies from day one. They blazed out of Sin City wearing pastel jackets and make-up and eye-watering shirts. As the laconic, slightly spacey Keuning will recall of their first show as a foursome, in a Las Vegas club called the Junkyard in August 2002, 'even then, people were like, \"Who do these guys think they are?\" Well, anybody can wear a T-shirt and jeans. But this is a show and we want to look good and we want to have fun. I think I had a pink shirt on.' Pause. 'I got rid of that shirt.' </p> <p>After the British Eighties disco look (and sound) of Hot Fuss, the Killers went native for Sam's Town. It was a record that sounded like widescreen America and it had the boots, bootlace ties and waistcoats to prove it.</p> <p>'With Sam's Town,' says wisecracking life-and-soul Vannucci, 'I think we had just been on tour [promoting Hot Fuss], visiting all these new places, being detached from our desert home.' Indeed: before the release of Hot Fuss, Brandon Flowers had never had a passport. 'Being away from family, remembering where you come from, was probably heavy on Brandon's mind,' the drummer continues. 'And one thing just flowed into the next. It was never, \"OK guys, let's dress up like fucking cowboys!\"' Vannucci thinks that look might have started with the Anton Corbijnshoot for the album sleeve with the photographer 'playing dressing up...' But, he insists, this was not post-Joshua Tree-style affectation. 'Vegas is not about the Palms Hotel casino and black shiny shirts. If you're local, it's more about horseshit and gunsmoke! So that's what we brought to the stage.' And, in the drummer's case, an extravagant My Name is Wyatt Earp moustache.</p> <p>Anyway, Flowers wants to underscore this: that look, and that sound, they're all in the past. The Killers as extras from Deadwood? It's so 2007. For album proper number three, the band are going wilder still. 'Sam's Town was very specific. It was a return home album,' says the quiet Stoermer, a former medical student with whom still waters run very deep. 'This new album is perhaps more progressive and... I don't want to say global, but it's more universal.' </p> <p>On the Killers' new album, to be called Day and Age, there are synths involved. There are big rousing tunes, for sure. But there are also harpsichords, moonscapes, saxophones, brass, strings, feathers and fur and steel drums. Steel drums? </p> <p>'Seriously, the last time I heard steel drums was in The Little Mermaid!' Flowers exclaims. 'I don't know if that's a good reason or not to use them.'</p> <p>Right then. Studio time. Brandon Flowers leaves his kitchen, still fretting. </p> <p><strong>Dublin, 20-21 August </strong></p> <p>Fifteen minutes after they come offstage at the Academy in the Irish capital, the Killers' small and busy dressing room under the stairs is sweltering. </p> <p>Ronnie Vannucci is forced to stand in the corridor outside to talk to Jack Black. The actor-cum-comedy-rocker's band Tenacious D are in town to support Metallica at Marlay Park. Vannucci and Black are guffawing about the perennial rock star problem of overly sweaty gussets. Brandon Flowers, still wired and still perspiring from the performance, sits on a chair, both knees doing the St Vitus Dance. He's digging into a full size box of bran flakes, shovelling the dry cereal into his mouth but taking care to avoid the raisins. Mark Stoermer idly fingers a leather case containing champagne and Guinness. It's a gift from Dublin's favourite sons, and the band the Killers most want to emulate. A card inside reads: 'Welcome to Dublin from The U2'ers'. Their manager, Paul McGuinness, stands by the doorway, chatting. 'He owns the space around him,' Flowers will later chuckle. 'Makes our manager nervous!' </p> <p>Flowers, too, is a little nervous. Tonight's 850-capacity club show, a warm-up for tomorrow night's show at Marlay Park, which is itself a warm-up for headline slots at the Reading and Leeds festivals, was great. The band played a quasi-acoustic version of 'Smile Like You Mean It', with Flowers at the piano. Their decidedly strange collaboration with Lou Reed, last year's 'Tranquilize' single, worked well. Two new songs, 'Neon Tiger' and 'Spaceman', were greeted enthusiastically by the crowd. But Flowers's racing brain is already on to the next hurdle. Chatting to McGuinness, he discovers that U2's new album is scheduled for release a week before theirs. How do they follow that? 'So there's U2, Oasis, Snow Patrol, Keane, Kaiser Chiefs...' He ticks off the autumn's big albums on his fingers (the U2 record later shifts to next year). Shit. Lot of competition. Flowers chomps at his cereal with agitated gusto.</p> <p>You might say they haven't made things easy for themselves. The Killers interrupted recording on Day and Age to embark on a month-long tour: a handful of small North American shows followed by this run of European festival dates. Then they are heading to London to hook up with Stuart Price again and finish the album. Everything is running impossibly close to deadline.</p> <p>After midnight the Killers leave the club and drive the few hundred yards back to their hotel. Flowers's wife Tana and infant son are upstairs but he lingers in the lobby with a laptop, poring over new band photographs till 1am. Some feature the four-piece seemingly standing on the moon. In others, Flowers is wearing a Dolce &amp; Gabbana jacket with elaborate fur and feather epaulettes designed by British fashionista Fee Doran. She was introduced to Flowers by Stuart Price, for whom she once made a black leather catsuit. She's most famous for making the white hooded jumpsuit Kylie Minogue wore in the 'Can't Get You Out of My Head' video. </p> <p>'Sci-fi jungle!' says Vannucci, jokingly, of the new look that the band - well, the more outr\u00e9 Flowers and Keuning - will be rocking. 'It's the new emo! No longer neo-synth fetishists, we're sci-fi jungle! No more Wyatt Earp moustache, although I could grow it back in a few hours...'</p> <p>The next day Flowers and I sit down with tea and cookies in the deserted hotel restaurant. Last night, once he got over his collywobbles about the U2 album, he seemed friendly and relaxed but today, talking about the new album properly for the first time, there are nerves.</p> <p>I say to Flowers: you said that Sam's Town was about embracing more of your own culture. Did you achieve that?</p> <p>'Well, what's goofy is, America didn't care! Over here in the UK they did. It's sitting alongside Hot Fuss [in sales]. But in America it did half of what Hot Fuss did - 1.5m rather than 3m. So it just shows you how cynical people can be. We were trying to do something heartfelt - and it was heartfelt.'</p> <p>How did an avowedly American record fail to sell well in America?</p> <p>'It was kind of cursed from the start. The press were really rough on it.' The Killers were particularly aggrieved with a two-out-of-five review in Rolling Stone. 'I mean, just for having 'When You Were Young' on it, it deserves better than what it got. That song will be around for ever.'</p> <p>Did Americans think you were trying too hard to be Americans?</p> <p>'Maybe. We came out with Hot Fuss and were wearing suits and there's make-up and there's glitz. Definitely they saw [the Sam's Town look] as being contrived. I absolutely understand that now when I look at it. It's a never-ending battle for me. We were these poor kids and the whole idea of being a band was to put ourselves out there as this glamorous thing. Almost the opposite of the Strokes - these wealthy kids who are these dirty rock'n'rollers. Instead of dirtying it up, it was about excess and overindulgence and names and Gucci. It's almost a hip hop thing. Bling, that's kinda what it was like.'</p> <p>Improbable as it may seem, the none-more-vanilla Flowers is hip hop in other ways - shooting his mouth off, proclaiming his own greatness while panning others. It's not the Killers' fault that Sam's Town didn't sell as well as Hot Fuss at home - it was 'cynical' America which didn't 'get' the album. He's open in his desire for the Killers to be a stadium-sized act, to catch up with Coldplay and join up with U2 on the top 'pedestal... They're getting old. You know there's going to be a coupla songs on [U2's new] record you're just going to love. They're unbelievable. But there's gotta be... I dunno, it feels like it's time.'</p> <p>Last time we spoke he accused Thom Yorke of wasting his talent by not writing such catchy tunes any more. He laid into Green Day for un-American activity: recording a concert DVD in Milton Keynes ('I just thought it was really cheap. To go to a place like England and sing American Idiot...'). Now, he admits ruefully, 'that didn't help us out either [in America]. People love Green Day. Anyone that maybe would have been on the fence with us, that was a real decider that they didn't like us.' Flowers regrets the diss, then, but mainly because it hit his own band's sales.</p> <p>According to the man who made it, meanwhile, Sam's Town was directly influenced by Springsteen and was one of the best albums of the past 20 years. These vainglorious quotes are still following the Killers round now.</p> <p>'Yeah, he shouldn't have said any of that crap!' says Keuning with a snort. 'I hadn't thought about Springsteen once... Now he's probably a little bit more careful. I didn't agree with the things he said. Those things don't necessarily represent the band. He was just excited about Sam's Town when he said that 20 years thing, but I had no idea how bad it was going to bite us in the ass.'</p> <p>'The thing I love about Brandon is that he says whatever the fuck he thinks,' says Price. 'And he doesn't care if he's blowing six litres of smoke up his own arse or in someone else's face. That is so refreshing, to have someone that just goes: \"Fuck it, I want to be the best and this is what I think.\" And he backs that up with hard work.'</p> <p>He's a funny bloke, Brandon. He has a heart of gold, is thoroughly likable and is staggeringly charismatic on stage. He can write pop hits and stadium anthems seemingly at will. But he's also supremely jittery, occasionally paranoid and easily rattled. It's like he always has something to prove - a legacy, perhaps, of being the baby of his family. He's the youngest of six; his nearest sibling, Shane, is 12 years older than him. It's handsome, born-on-the-4th-of-July Shane (as mentioned in the lyrics to 'Sam's Town') whom young Brandon was always trying to catch up with.</p> <p>All this can make him come over as aloof and distant. His interview posture is bolt upright like a schoolboy, or arms firmly folded like a shield. It all helps lead to statements of intent that read terribly baldly in print. </p> <p>Why do you think many people have a problem with your ambition? </p> <p>'I don't know. I guess they like it better if you just keep your head down and all that. I'm not sure what bothers them so much about it.'</p> <p>Because they see you as a craven careerist?</p> <p>'I've seen that before. The singer of Idlewild said I was like Pete Sampras. He could see it in my eyes - dead, cold, a drive, ready to step on whoever I need to. And I'm not like that at all.'</p> <p>Anyway, golf is your game.</p> <p>[Grinning] 'Yeah. Tiger Woods, please. But it's just about the songs.'</p> <p>It's excitement rather than a rampant ego that propels you to talk up your records?</p> <p>'Yes. That's it. I've never been able to explain it easily. I don't wake up and say, \"I'm the greatest.\"'</p> <p><strong>That night the Killers play Marlay Park to a sold-out </strong>crowd of 32,000, the biggest audience they've ever drawn on their own (that is, other than when they've played at festivals). There is satisfaction within the Killers camp that Metallica didn't sell out the previous night. The 16-song set is blisteringly good. The by-now-traditional set-closing encore is the glorious 'All These Things That I've Done', Flowers's song about struggling to reconcile his Mormon faith with the temptations facing a man and a rock star. As Killers crowds always do, the entire park begins singing the chorus while the band are offstage, readying for the encore: 'I've got soul but I'm not a soldier...' It's spine-tingling to hear.</p> <p>Throughout the show a member of the Killers' entourage takes pictures from the side of the stage. These days he is the only photographer allowed to shoot the band live. After gigs, the media are invited to pick shots that the band have selected to put up on a special website. Later I ask Flowers why such an edict is necessary.</p> <p>'Ah-ha-ha,' he laughs nervously. He begins by saying that the ban on outside photographers was in response to publications tending to use the same kind of image repeatedly: him with his mouth wide open, singing. Or, as he puts it, 'the screaming moment... It just to got to be - well, for me, I didn't like it.'</p> <p>And is it correct that you'll only be filmed head-on, not from underneath?</p> <p>'Yeah. Why? It's a very unflattering place to have your picture taken. You can't avoid looking like you have a double chin, especially if you're singing and opening your mouth and screaming. It's a misrepresentation.'</p> <p>But you're lean and in good shape.</p> <p>'I'm lean. But I'm not as lean as the dreams of.... Iggy Pop and the good old days.'</p> <p>Would you say you were vain, Brandon?</p> <p>[Laughing] 'I don't know if it means I'm vain. I'm cautious!'</p> <p>And you like being in control?</p> <p>'Well, you know, it's our destiny that we're playing with here.'</p> <p>Presumably you appreciate that your banning photographers from your shows will be construed as controlling and egomaniacal?</p> <p>'Yeah, I don't understand that. I don't mind it. People can think what they want to think.'</p> <p><strong>London, 3 September</strong></p> <p>Last night the Killers partied. Brandon Flowers collected the award for Most Stylish Man at GQ's Men of the Year event at the Royal Opera House. He smoked cigarettes and drank champagne and ended the night at celeb hang-out Bungalow 8. He's a practising Mormon but not 100 per cent observant, although his son is named after a prophet in the Book of Mormon. How has having a child affected his faith?</p> <p>'It's kind of solidified it.' He pauses, wary of discussing religion - he's enough of a student of music history to know that the holy rock'n'roller is a precarious route to go down. 'I feel like it's an arrogant thought to think we're an accident, or that we're this smart without a little bit of a help. I just think it's a miracle.'</p> <p>For some people, childbirth reaffirms their faith in creationism; a higher power had a hand...</p> <p>'Yeah, definitely. It's definitely made me... And it's made me a lot less selfish too, so it's good. I love music, but I look at it more as my job now than I did. Now I'm going off to work. Now I almost think I'm doing this for him and for his future. Everything's changed. There's all kinds of shit brewing in my brain. I wonder if it's weird that I get manicures! Ha ha ha! My dad didn't get manicures, I don't know if I should... Why do I? I dunno! Because they give you a massage at the end of it. It feels nice.'</p> <p>We're talking in Olympic Studios in Barnes, south-west London. The Killers have two-and-a-half days to finish Day and Age. The tight schedule has meant they had to nix yesterday's planned recording session with Elton John: he and Flowers have written a Christmas song (the Killers' third), called 'Joseph, Better You Than Me'.</p> <p>The band play me a handful of new songs. 'Human', the first single, is a Pet Shop Boys-style synth-pop zoomer that should please fans of 'Mr Brightside'. 'Losing Touch' is driven by blasts of dirty saxophone. 'I Can't Stay' is brilliantly wonky: steel drums, harpsichords and a shuffling rhythm which Keuning describes as 'stranded on an island', and which Flowers admits was taken from Unit 4+2's 1965 British No 1 'Concrete and Clay' (he heard it on the soundtrack to Rushmore). And on the 'Club Tropicana'-esque 'Joyride', the Killers got the funk. </p> <p>On one listen it's thrilling, the sound of America's most adventurous big-hitters spinning off in umpteen new directions. As Stuart Price says: 'I think the wrongness is part of the thing that appeals to Europeans about the Killers.'</p> <p>'A Dustland Fairytale' is more reminiscent of the grand rock of Sam's Town. Studded with punchy piano, it sounds like a Jim Steinman production. It features lines like 'slick chrome American prince', 'long brown hair and foolish eyes', and 'white trash county'. It's the story of how Flowers's mum and dad met - they were both aged 15 and lived on the same trailer park.</p> <p>The song that's causing Flowers most trouble is 'Goodnight, Travel Well'. Set to be the album's closer and running to almost seven minutes, it's a tribute to Dave Keuning's recently deceased mother, and to Brandon Flowers's mum, who has a brain tumour (he says she's responding 'really well to the chemo and the radiation so far'). He needs to get the lyrics right: tender but not mawkish. I hear the unfinished version. It's a gothic symphony, bursting with brass and strings.</p> <p>As Flowers describes it: 'It goes from being the darkest thing we've ever done before shooting up to the clouds at the end. Oh, it's a heartbreaker. It just rips your guts out.'</p> <p>If Flowers can face singing it night after night, it should be a great main set closer.</p> <p>'We use the analogy of too much chocolate. That's maybe how Killers shows have been in the past, sometimes it's too much - we don't have our ups and downs. It's been a real breath of fresh air doing the songs from Sawdust and the stripped down 'Smile Like You Mean it'. It's not just in your face the whole time. It really felt like a real band. A more mature...' Flowers stops and smiles. 'Men were up there playing.'</p> <p>Right then. Studio time. The Killers have a little over 48 hours to nail the finale to the album that, if all goes to plan, will keep them on the road until the end of 2010. The only way is up. In terms of sound and in terms of stature, their ambition knows no bounds. If Brandon Flowers, baby of the family and baby of the band, has anything to do with it, the world's record-buying, concert-going masses will be moved.</p> <p>'I have an unexplainable drive,' he cheerfully admits. 'I don't know exactly where it comes from, but it borders on obsession. There's something special about bringing that many people together and celebrating that way. I want that! I am greedy and selfish but I want that every night.'</p> <h2>Bigmouth strikes again: Brandon Flowers bitches</h2> <p>'I can see the Strokes play or Franz Ferdinand play and it's real, and I haven't gotten that from the Bravery. I think people will see through them.'<br><strong>March 2005</strong></p> <p>'We have a song called \"Midnight Show\" and in America they love it. In England they don't move at all. What's wrong with them?' <br><strong>April 2005</strong></p> <p>'What song do I hate? I think 'Daughters' by John Mayer would be a good candidate.' <br><strong>2005</strong></p> <p>On Fall Out Boy: 'Emo is dangerous. There's a creature inside me that wants to beat all those bands to death.' <br><strong>June 2006</strong></p> <p>On Thom Yorke: 'He should feel grateful that he's [been] given the gift to write pop songs - which he needs to write again.' <br><strong>September 2006</strong></p> <p>On Green Day filming their American Idiot DVD in the UK: 'I saw it as a very negative thing towards Americans. It really lit a fire in me.' <br><strong>October 2006</strong></p> <p>'I think people are lazy, and that goes for making music too.' <br><strong>November 2006</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Day and Age (Mercury) will be released on 24 November</p>",

  "<p>Last week, the most free market administration in the West nationalised the US's two giant mortgage banks, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, in the world's biggest ever bank bail-out. Shareholders saw $20bn of their wealth eliminated but the American government's concern was not them. America's private financial system, like ours, has seized up. Without the bail-out the US mortgage and housing market would have collapsed.</p> <p>It is a landmark event as Hank Poulson, US Treasury Secretary, acknowledged - underlined by the emergency talks in which he is now locked this weekend to save another casualty of the credit crunch, the US investment bank, Lehman Brothers. For 30 years the financial system in Britain and America has been the battering ram for the free market revolution. The theory has been that markets are so efficient that regulation and state intervention must be as minimal as possible - allowing a very particular conception of finance, exemplified by hedge funds and private equity, to become the most dominant influence in our economies. Now the theory and its practice have exploded.</p> <p>This is an intellectual and political bombshell. Thatcher would never have been such a radical free marketer without continual succour from the now dead American example; Blair and New Labour would never have made so many concessions, especially to the City, without the continuing intellectual, economic and political pressure from the US to keep the state out of finance. The result has not just been the house price boom and incredible levels of personal debt, now unwinding in our very own British credit crunch. It has been that government and business alike have been in thrall to hegemonic deregulated financial markets and their sole interest - to maximise immediate short term profits.</p> <p>All this can now change. Britain has a massively unbalanced economy. Financial services are overblown; industry undernourished. Every chief executive I have spoken to over the last few years has had mounting concern that the financial markets and uncommitted shareholders do not value what business values: research, innovation, motivated people, brand, loyalty, trust, independence. What the markets value instead is the takeover, so many of which go wrong. There is equal concern about how extravagant City pay has become a benchmark for corporate salaries, crippling internal norms of fairness. Nor they do agree with the City ideology that the state necessarily bungles everything because it is the state, while free markets never make mistakes. Serious chief executives know how crucial the state is to fund research, education, skills and the national infrastructure - and that it can be adaptive and intelligent.</p> <p>But for the change to happen there has to be political leadership. For decades progressive politics has been hobbled by a ball and chain around its feet. Now it can break free. The ideology and practice of the City can be challenged and reformed, and policies that enhance genuine and fair wealth generation be championed. The floundering government has a heaven-sent opportunity: if Brown and Darling have the imagination and chutzpah to seize it. If they don't, they should stand aside for those who will. This case needs to be made in office, not in opposition.</p> <p>The first battle that has to be won is over the mortgage market. Britain has swung from mortgage glut to mortgage famine. British banks and building societies have supplemented their own deposits to fund lending by bundling up mortgages as collateral for new, tradeable mortgage-backed bonds. But investors have suffered a crisis of confidence and the market is now shut. Former chief executive of HBOS, Sir James Crosby, in his review for the Treasury, says it will stay shut for the next three years. Thus the mortgage famine. Nobody knows where house prices, now falling at 2 per cent a month, will settle. What we do know is that if they carry on falling at this rate for another year the financial system will be crippled, risking a very deep recession.</p> <p>One option to reopen the market is for the government temporarily to guarantee investors that in return for an insurance premium they will get their money back in full - a far less radical move than America's. But the governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn King, has emerged as the leader of a ragbag of reactionary forces who are utterly opposed. As he told MPs last week house prices should not be artificially propped up by a temporary government guarantee that will become permanent. The Utopian vision against which he benchmarks policy is the now defunct ideology that the inevitably bungling state should never upset markets that are always efficient. Britain must suffer the necessary market correction, whatever the pain.</p> <p>He is wrong. This is a bet that the credit crunch will not induce a big recession, and it is a provenly mistaken view of how markets function. New Keynesian thinking likens today's financial markets to tightly coupled, interconnected but high-risk operating systems like nuclear power stations or oil refineries. Problems are transmitted at lightning speed from one market to another, jumping over boundaries as they do when a nuclear reactor melts down. But markets cannot look to control room operators, as in a power station, to contain the impact of the shock. Instead, left to themselves, they amplify it. </p> <p>The markets now need someone in the control room to remedy malfunctions. The proposition is not to prop up house prices; rather it is to address a system failure and get mortgage finance moving again so that the housing market can start to function. The speed of fall of today's prices is as irrational as the rise was two years ago. Both were dangerous: both should be averted. In any case, the economic and political, like bank bail-outs, have been going hand in hand for centuries. To inflict suffering on millions to pursue an impossible ideal of a market economy without active public institutions and intervention is irrational and unfair.</p> <p>King, famously an intellectual bully, needs to be taken on. But the temporary guarantee should only be the first step in a new progressive politics. First and foremost we need the markets to value what business values. Shareholders should only win rights to dividends and votes in British quoted companies by signing a newly initiated declaration of the firm's purpose which they are legally obliged to uphold. All mergers and takeovers should meet both this purpose and public interest safeguards. The banks should partner the government in establishing a new Long Term Investment Bank to provide patient, committed long-term finance. The Financial Services Authority should regulate bank operating margins as if they were utilities, and investment and commercial banking should be separated. One per cent of bank assets should be directed to community and social projects.</p> <p>We need to limit the potential for speculative frenzy. All financial securities should be traded in licensed exchanges by organisations whose accounts are subject to regular inspection and where bargains are routed through a central clearing house. Anonymous trading should be outlawed. And financial pay must come back to earth. The higher the pay, the more the regulator should ask banks to strengthen their balance sheets.</p> <p>Thus the new agenda. Today's City is as over-powerful as trade unions were in the Seventies. Nick Clegg's Lib Dems could lead, but have got lost. Cameron's Conservatives are the City's ally. Only pusillanimity and dither stand between Labour and seizing an extraordinary political chance.</p>",
  "<p>It all began on Monday. I had a lunch appointment at the Royal Overseas League, one of those timeless clubs in St James's, though not so timeless that I could afford to be late.</p> <p>As I was leaving, I received an email, ostensibly from Windows Live. This informed me that Microsoft had been conducting a security review of all its accounts and that mine was about to be suspended unless I supplied some basic information such as an email address and password.</p> <p>Which, very foolishly, I did. In the roughly five seconds that I contemplated this before dashing out, any nagging doubts at the back of my mind were put to one side by the thought that I couldn't afford to lose Hotmail.</p> <p>On Wednesday, the phone began ringing soon after 8am. Was I all right? Everyone I had ever known, it seemed, had received messages saying that I was marooned in Nigeria and in dire need of assistance: could they please forward $1,500 (about \u00a3850)?</p> <p>I no longer had access to my own account (the password and even the secret question had been changed) so I was unable to pass on the news that I was not destitute in west Africa, but alive and well in London and no more financially embarrassed than usual. </p> <p>I quickly appreciated the difficulties this could cause. I gloomily imagined bogus requests for assistance having been sent to an assortment of contacts who would doubtless include Ian Hislop, law professors in the United States and Australia, and fellow supporters of West Bromwich Albion.</p> <p>I was stricken by the thought that impecunious miscarriage of justice groups might be organising whip-rounds to bring me back to England.</p> <p>Ironically, my wife was one of the few not to receive the email. She works for a branch of government, where screening systems are clearly highly efficient. However, a high proportion of contacts did receive it so that the phone was going all day. It's at times like these that you find out who really cares, so I'm happy to report that my children and my agent were among early callers.</p> <p>Those who did respond to the Nigerian scammer, asking for further information, received speedy responses. The original email had been reasonably well presented but, given the scammer's need for haste, composing instant replies was obviously hazardous. It was touching that so many said they could tell it wasn't me because of the grammatical errors.</p> <p>One solicitor did anxiously persevere, and even tentatively offered to send \u00a3500, until the fake Bob Woffinden was unmasked by his inability to name the incoming Lord Chief Justice.</p> <p>The television producer Sita Williams phoned to say that she was especially not taken in because she has a drama about online scams from Nigeria (Wired, starring Toby Stephens and Jodie Whittaker) due for transmission later this year.</p> <p>Internet research reveals that this has been one of the summer's major scams. Some of those affected complained that Microsoft allowed Hotmail accounts to be targeted too easily, and only responded to the problem sluggishly, although I had no cause to complain about that.</p> <p>Earlier this year, the Office of Fair Trading launched a campaign to try to encourage the reporting of scams, pointing out that fewer than five per cent of victims reported them to the authorities. (But how can they know that? If they're not reported, how can they know how many there are?) However, when one of my contacts reported this scam to her local police, they bluntly told her they weren't interested.</p> <p>In the end, the upsides were that it was a very eventful day; that I spoke to lots of old friends from all over the world; and that, as readers can see, it's all grist to the journalistic mill.</p> <p>The downsides were that it was a lot of hassle and inconvenience.</p> <p>It is also strangely disheartening to realise that the scammer expended time, effort and modest ingenuity on something which, so far as I can tell, reaped no reward at all. In fact, one friend (a journalist, naturally) was completely taken in, but even so he had no intention of sending any money.</p> <p>I suppose the lessons to be learnt are that if you don't know who you're communicating with on the internet, it's very probably not who you think it is; that scams are getting superficially more sophisticated all the time; and never give away your password. My new one's a complete secret.</p>",
  "<p>And the winner is ... Iain Gray. The personable former teacher in Mozambique becomes the leader of Labour's group of MSPs and the inheritor of Scottish politics' poisoned chalice - a receptacle which, as I know from experience, can pass among the parties, but today it is Labour's.</p> <p>An observer might ponder why anyone should want this job. As was pointed out during the contest, the constitutional position in the Labour party gives the 'Scottish leader limited authority over the party organisation and its policy'. The post only dates back to the immediate pre-devolution days, and three of Mr Gray's predecessors - Messrs Dewar, McLeish and McConnell - were more than compensated by enjoying the office of First Minister. An interesting feature regarding the campaign is how few people credibly thought that we had been witnessing the election of the next First Minister.</p> <p>To be elected the day newswires buzz with plots against your UK leader is inauspicious. Following the loss of Glasgow East, and defending Glenrothes, few bet on a Labour win in 2010.</p> <p>And yet each of the leadership contenders was a serious player. Iain Gray has held ministerial responsibility for Scotland's community development, transport, enterprise and tertiary education sectors; Cathy Jamieson was an able steward of the education and justice portfolios, overseeing important reforms; and as health minister, Andy Kerr piloted the bill to ban smoking in public places, which some would argue is the Scottish Parliament's single most important piece of legislation to date.</p> <p>Exercising such responsibility in a country of five million arguably gives each of them more executive experience than the lady who, after November, could be a heartbeat from the presidency of the US. Knowing all three candidates, I can confidently assert, thankfully, that none is a pit bull with lipstick. But how Labour must yearn for its new leader to energise the party's roots in the way Mrs Palin has done with the Republicans. Competent management and cautious policy positions will not be enough. Iain Gray will require a flare and boldness which hitherto have not been his hallmarks.</p> <p>However, his immediate binning of the party's 2007 manifesto shows a determined start. And there are other opportunities ahead to claim a distinctive position.</p> <p>The SNP government is set to press ahead with local income tax. During the leadership campaign, all three candidates expressed unease about the council tax in its present form, but were typically vague about what they would actually do. With this issue certain to be centre stage at Holyrood over the coming months, the new leader should be staking out Labour's ground.</p> <p>As winter approaches, the growing problems of fuel poverty in Scotland will continue to make headlines. This should stir the passions of a party committed to social justice. It's not mandatory for Iain Gray to express disappointment over the modesty of Gordon Brown's response, but given his perceived identification with the London leadership, such independence of expression would help. Developing a package of measures with the creative use of the Scottish Parliament's powers would not only be in contrast to the limp soundbite response of the SNP government, but might also provide an agenda for action which could command majority support in a Parliament where all parties are minorities.</p> <p>And it would be useful to know where exactly Scottish Labour stands on the question of further powers for the Scottish Parliament, and in particular its future funding arrangements. It was to Wendy Alexander's credit that she managed to move the party from the ostrich-like position which it adopted on devolution at the 2007 election - 'thus far and no further'. Having moved, the next step is for Labour to say what it really thinks on this issue.</p> <p>As a member of the Calman Commission, I receive regular press cuttings of news reports on the debate around the Parliament's powers. Over the last few weeks, I cannot recall any substantive comment from any of Labour's leadership candidates on this issue. Mr Gray might retort that constitutional arrangements don't rank high on people's priorities - far better to focus on apprenticeships and housing. But it's not an either/or. His predecessor brought the motion to the Scottish Parliament which established the commission; and it was a Labour government at Westminster which gave it its support.</p> <p>The issue is on the agenda, so it's not good enough to say: 'We leave it to Calman and look forward to its report.' If the deliberations of the commission can be informed by submissions from the Institute of Local Television, the National Farmers Union of Scotland and the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations, shouldn't we also have the benefit of the Labour party in Scotland's thoughts on the subject?</p> <p>A submission to Calman from Iain Gray would be illuminating. And it certainly would be guaranteed attention.</p> <p>A new leader, a fresh mandate; no better time to be bold. And if the post is strictly one of leading the Labour group at Holyrood, turn that to good account. Whatever his future aspirations, Iain Gray leads an opposition party. Indeed, he is leader of the principal opposition party, and in a parliamentary democracy that is a responsible role. He is always going to command more media attention and have more parliamentary opportunities than the best efforts of Tavish Scott and Annabel Goldie. Gray's biggest challenge is to understand that, throw off the all too evident caution of a government mindset and meet the challenges of opposition.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Lord Wallace of Tankerness is former leader of the Liberal Democrats in Scotland</p>",
  "<p>In Unjust Rewards, their timely attack on Britain's tax-dodging, crunch-proof super-rich, Polly Toynbee and David Walker introduce readers to an unlikely ally. Geordie Greig, the editor of Tatler, is also, it emerges, outraged by the gulf which has opened up between unspeakably wealthy people and the merely well off; people whom he characterised to Toynbee and Walker as 'hard-working middle-class professionals, many of whom can no longer afford to pay school fees or buy nice houses in the places where they were brought up and which they consider home'.</p> <p>Such complaints show, say Walker and Toynbee, that 'everyone has a sticking point where \"enough is enough\", where the sight of the wealth gap yawns too wide. In his discomfort is political opportunity.' And it is in this context, perhaps, that we should approach a feature in the latest Tatler about some of the 'new generation of Conservatives' who will shortly be tackling the chasm of secret suffering which separates Geordie Greig from people much richer than him.</p> <p>Although some commentators believe that the party's willingness to supply nine glossy hopefuls to pose in designer clothes - 'future defence secretary Annunziata Rees-Mogg in Yves Saint Laurent; future chancellor Jeremy Brier, in Moschino' - was an error which might even undermine faith in the Conservatives' claim to be the country's progressive conscience, the choice of Greig's Tatler surely confirms that when Osborne threatens non-doms with a swingeing, flat-rate tax of some five handbags a year, he means business. And as Joanne Cash, tipped to be a future housing minister, reminded Tatler, money is needed. 'A 16-year-old girl without family support who wants to stay on at school gets no help from the current benefits system,' she lamented (guessing, no doubt accurately, that most Tatler readers will be unaware that the 16-year-old could, in fact, claim an education maintenance allowance of \u00a330 per week).</p> <p>She continued: 'Yet if that same teenager gets pregnant, she will be prioritised on the housing list and given a range of benefits. This must be wrong.' That's if she got it right. Either way, all credit to foxy Joanne for introducing the words 'benefits' and 'housing list' into Tatler's special spa issue: 'High-end deprivation weeks have become the big travel trend of the past five years.'</p> <p>As for her colleague Jeremy Brier; although he might, in an ideal world, have found an audience larger than Tatler's with which to share some stirring thoughts on low-end deprivation - 'Conservatism means championing the poor and protecting the vulnerable' - the poor are no doubt delighted to find themselves championed on any platform outside the TUC conference. Indeed, if Jeremy's aper\u00e7u leads to a few of its readers asking why, after 10 years of Labour, not one luxury spa has opened its doors to a customer from a less privileged background, Tatler will have achieved more than many other publications whose coverage of poverty, according to the authors of a Joseph Rowntree Foundation report 'The Media, Poverty and Public Opinion in the UK', is lamentably 'superficial', 'rather than driven to understand poverty and its problems'.</p> <p>Analysing existing press and television depictions of poor people, the authors argue, often persuasively, that lukewarm public support for anti-poverty measures is unsurprising when programmes such as The Jeremy Kyle Show display potential beneficiaries in such a gruesome light. 'The inference to be drawn,' they say, 'is that those without (those experiencing poverty) are not like us and are not deserving of what we have.' Much more to their taste, intriguingly, is The Secret Millionaire, a Channel 4 programme which is singled out for its 'enlightened' portrayal of poverty. </p> <p>The poor people depicted in that programme are certainly a philanthropist's dream: uncomplaining, humble, hygienic and, above all, guaranteed to weep with gratitude when they are identified by a person of high net worth as especially meritorious. Incredibly, many of them do not even blaspheme. No Victorian sweep with tears tracking down his sooty little cheeks could be more pleasing.</p> <p>The show features a series of relatively non-repulsive multimillionaires who, having established that the promotional value outweighs the inconvenience, travel incognito (with a film crew) around some benighted area where a variety of poor have been selected for inspection. To add to the effect, the millionaire is billeted in a nasty poor place and made to wash his own smalls, often to the distress of his loving family. Millionaires, we learn, have feelings. Just like us.</p> <p>Along this very personal journey the millionaire says things such as: 'I have so much and these people have so little.' No one asks the millionaire why it has taken him so long to get round to noticing this. Finally, the millionaire selects his favourites from the people who have been auditioning, in their innocence, for his favours, and then - confessing his identity! - distributes gratuities which, so far as one can guess, would amount to around 1p of an ordinary person's fortune. Still, it's the thought that counts. In scenes that show what Dickens might have done with A Christmas Carol if only he'd taken advice from Channel 4, the poor people exclaim: 'Oh my Gawd - we're going to be warm this winter!'</p> <p>Though it must be debatable that such scenes enhance the dignity of people the Rowntree Foundation would like the media to describe as 'experiencing poverty', the value of Channel 4's programme to people experiencing wealth is beyond price. To be fair to the BBC, its pioneering work, notably in The Apprentice and Dragons' Den, and on behalf of individuals such as Simon Cowell and Andrew Lloyd Webber, has already done much to transform the most unappetising businessmen into celebrities, with their own screen personalities and catchphrases. That of one moneyed turn, a Mr Paphitis, for example, is recorded on the corporation's website as: 'Why should I part with any of my children's inheritance investing in this?'</p> <p>If a shortage of personalised stories helps explain, as the Rowntree Foundation maintains, low levels of public sympathy for poor people, maybe the media's contrasting services to individual plutocrats accounts for some of the continued public passivity where the super-rich are concerned, despite a year's sustained evidence, from banks, the City and elsewhere, of this group's parasitism, greed and uselessness. Even in Italy, where the presidency can be bought, there were signs this summer of anti-rich restlessness, with wet sand thrown at an ostentatious football club owner and rumours that Roman Abramovitch had been denied a restaurant table.</p> <p>Here, for all the campaigning by Toynbee, Walker, and the heroic Vince Cable, it appears to be business as usual. In the same week that a Guardian survey identified a further increase, on the brink of recession, in the already grotesque disparity between top directors' pay and that of their workers, a new book called The Secrets of CEOs held up the achievements of this very group for general admiration. Maybe we should, after all, applaud the redistributive efforts of Geordie Greig. Whatever you might think about Tatler, he is the closest we are ever going to get to a secret poor person.</p>",
  "<p>The Liberal Democrats discard leaders like other people chuck out their old socks. When they met for their conference at this time a year ago, there was a rumble against Sir Menzies Campbell. His colleagues dutifully protested their loyalty to Sir Menzies. A few weeks later, he was gone. The year before, Charles Kennedy was the leader. There was a rumble against him too. Everyone ritually intoned their confidence in Charles. Within months, he was gone. This year there is a bit of a rumble against Nick Clegg, but I will make the mildly hazardous prediction that he really is safe in his job. The Lib Dems know they would look utterly absurd if they ditched three leaders in a single parliament. </p> <p>The challenge at his debut conference in Bournemouth is to persuade his party to follow the new direction that he is mapping out for them. Where once the Lib Dems concentrated most of their fire on the Tories, he now seeks to make them a much more explicitly anti-Labour force. This is a change with huge implications not just for the Lib Dems, but for British politics as a whole.</p> <p>An element of the explanation for this shift is generational. Nick Clegg is the first leader of the Lib Dems whose political personality was not formed in reaction to Thatcherism. His three predecessors were all forged in opposition to the 18 years of Tory rule in the Eighties and Nineties. Their formative political years were spent hating Margaret Thatcher and her works. That was what most animated Paddy Ashdown, Charles Kennedy and Menzies Campbell. Whatever they disliked about Labour, they loathed the Tories more. </p> <p>Nick Clegg is too young to be defined by that political period. He is more classically liberal, distrusting in roughly equal measure both of the big parties. One of his friends puts it like this: 'Nick's gut instincts are as passionately hostile to Gordon Brown's type of politics as they are to the Tories.' </p> <p>It is Mr Clegg's argument that the Labour model of delivering social progress has run its course. Statist, top-down social democracy has been tried and found wanting over the past decade. He will say that Labour has taxed and spent without getting sufficient return in either the performance of government services or their accountability to the public. This critique is not just a challenge to Labour. It is also rather bracing for many members of his own party who are being asked to reframe how they think about politics and their position on its spectrum. </p> <p>For years, the basic Lib Dem policy was to count up how much money was being spent by Labour and say they would spend a bit more. Turning that on its head, Mr Clegg wants to now make them a party promising to reduce spending and cut taxes. Where once his party tried to outbid Labour on spending, today he hopes to under-cut the Tories on tax. That will prompt cries of betrayal from the left of his party. Some will also react with horror to today's Observer interview with Vince Cable in which the deputy leader is rude about the European Union - as sacrilegious for some Lib Dems as spitting on the altar.</p> <p>The crucial vote at the conference is tomorrow when they debate a mini-manifesto clunkingly called 'Make It Happen', a ghastly title for an interesting document. The Clegg team sound a bit nervous. 'It's going to be pretty bumpy,' says one of them. It should help that Chris Huhne, his rival for the leadership, will be speaking in favour. </p> <p>This may be crudely interpreted as the Lib Dems lurching to the right, but there is nothing obviously right-wing about proposing to reduce the taxes paid by the less well-off and increasing capital gains tax on the affluent. Rather, Mr Clegg is trying to fashion a progressive alternative to Labour.</p> <p>Since he became leader he has made some thoughtful, occasionally provocative and almost wholly unreported speeches about public services. He has been trying to carve out a position which is distinct from both the Tory urge to shrivel the state and Labour's compulsion to central control. The education policy developed by David Laws favours encouraging a variety of providers to run state schools while proposing to direct more money to the schooling of children from deprived backgrounds. The first half of that would find a lot of favour among Tories; the second half would appeal to most Labour people. It is what Tony Blair used to call a Third Way. Indeed it is not that dissimilar to the schools system he would have set up had the Labour party let him do so. </p> <p>Nick Clegg is not a Tory disguised as a Lib Dem. I expect he will seek some easy applause from his party by taking pops at David Cameron. It is fair to say that the Lib Dem leader is placing his party in a much more hostile position towards Labour. While he plans a largely defensive operation against the Conservatives at the next election, he recently instructed his campaign team to identify 50 Labour seats for the Lib Dems to target. As much as anything, this shift of emphasis is being driven by the context in which he operates. When Paddy Ashdown was leading them, and for most of the time when Charles Kennedy was in charge, the Lib Dems were in competition with a dominant Labour party and a floundering Conservative party. With the limited resources at their disposal and to stay in tune with the public mood, it made sense for the Lib Dems to concentrate on making gains at the expense of the Tories. That created a great opportunity during Tony Blair's first term for a historic political realignment to forge a more permanent Lab-Lib alliance to lock the Tories out of power. Labour blew its chance to do that from a position of strength. </p> <p>Now it is the Tories who are ascendant while Labour plumbs the depths. The public mood is hostile to further tax increases and sceptical that it is getting value from all the money that has cascaded into public services. Mr Clegg responds accordingly, his natural instinct to put more distance between his party and a hugely unpopular Labour government chiming with the current mood of the voters. He is also trying to be practical. When Lib Dems look at the electoral map, they find it hard to see where they can achieve further wins at the expense of the Conservatives. 'We've hit granite against the Tories,' says one Lib Dem MP with a seat in the West Country. 'We're only going to make gains from them in special circumstances.' </p> <p>The Tories brushed off the Lib Dem challenge in the Henley byelection and increased their majority. Many Lib Dem MPs in the south will have to out-perform their party's national poll ratings if they are not to lose their seats to the resurgent Tories. </p> <p>Then there is the simple fact that there will be far more Labour seats to go for at the next election. Geography comes into this as well. Mr Clegg is an MP for Sheffield, a city where the rivalry for power is between his party and Labour. That is an additional spur for him to think that he is best off concentrating his party's resources on trying to unseat Labour MPs.</p> <p>There are several risks attached to this strategy. One large risk is that it may simply not work. Though they've had a lot of success winning councils from Labour, to the extent that they now run more big cities than any other party, the Lib Dems have a much less consistent record when it comes to taking parliamentary seats off Labour. They made a dozen gains at the expense of Labour at the last election, the most spectacular in constituencies where there was a lot of opposition to the Iraq war or student tuition fees or both.</p> <p>But the war and fees are no longer the incendiary issues that they were then. It is moot whether the Lib Dems can take Labour seats on the ambitious scale that Mr Clegg aims at when he says that he wants to double the number of Lib Dem MPs over two elections. </p> <p>Former Labour voters may not express their discontent by switching to his party. They may go directly across to the Tories. Did I say may? They already are and in large numbers. Senior Lib Dems are privately very disappointed that Labour's unpopularity is profiting David Cameron while not doing much to boost their own poll rating.</p> <p>This we can say for certain. The repositioning of the Lib Dems is further bad news for Gordon Brown or whoever else takes Labour into the next election.</p> <p>The Clegg strategy makes the atmospherics of politics even more hostile to the government. When the Lib Dems join the Tories in deploring the level of taxation and decrying government waste, Labour is left looking isolated and less credible when it tries to defend its record. As if things were not dire enough already for Labour, they now face the prospect that the next general election will be two against one.</p> <p>Some members of the cabinet privately clutch at straws by telling themselves that the Conservatives could be kept out of power by a Labour-Lib Dem coalition. </p> <p>In the event of a hung parliament, I've long thought that it would be a very tough sell for a Lib Dem leader to persuade his party to sustain Labour in office when the voters had just taken away its parliamentary majority. It is even harder to imagine how the two parties could share power after the next election if the Lib Dems have spent every day before it telling the country that Labour is unfit to govern. </p> <p>Nick Clegg's repositioning of his party is a perfectly understandable and entirely logical response to the collapse in support for Labour and the revival of the Conservatives. The irony is that the probable effect is to make it likelier that the Tories will win power. Without wanting to, Nick Clegg may be helping David Cameron across the threshold of Number 10.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Francis Bacon</strong> <br>Tate Britain, London SW1, until 4 Jan</p> <p>There are exhibitions - rare, superbly curated - that redefine an artist for a generation. The presentation of 100 works by Francis Bacon at Tate Britain until January, then at the Prado and the Metropolitan Museum in New York, is just such a world-class event. Everyone knows what a Bacon looks like, and since his death in 1992 there have been other shows to remind us, but none has revealed quite as clearly as this one just how mysterious and anarchic his art remains.</p> <p>Take the content of the paintings. What exactly is going on here? Clearly there are the simple auction-house categories: screaming popes and writhing figures, suicides and crucifixions, grand triptychs of agony and violence bought for record sums by Russian oligarchs. And perhaps it seems that violence must therefore be Bacon's theme: bodies splayed and disembowelled, heads twisted and split as in some motorway pile-up. The naked bulb dangles over an amputee (or so it seems). Tobacco bursts from the stubbed fag like the innards of a corpse and the suicide retches his last breath. Even the beds on which lovers grapple are more like mortuary slabs. </p> <p>It is certainly true that Bacon did not paint flowers - although there is in fact an amazingly eerie image of hydrangeas in the opening room - and that his popes and martyrs are consummate horror shows. Ectoplasm, gore, mucus, all sorts of nameless substances are evoked and even imitated by the paint itself, and his stated ambition was to make the pictures look 'as if a human being had passed between them, leaving a trail of the human presence as a snail leaves its slime'.</p> <p>But Bacon was a gregarious Soho bohemian. His people are almost always portraits of lovers and friends. What might look like botched surgery - and like is the operative word since one is always searching for analogies to make sense of his art - is performed on images of drinking companions. Nor could anyone fail to notice just how gorgeous and balletic his pictures are, with their jewel-rich colours and precise choreography; or that his draughtsmanship is so buoyant and deft, even cartoon-like.</p> <p>John Berger long ago compared Bacon to Walt Disney and, before reeling at the supposed heresy, ask yourself whether these paintings don't have a similar sort of fiendish exuberance in their leaping lines and curves. Tom the cat runs smack into the frying pan, his face flattens, but he bounces back. What is shocking is that Bacon's figures stay stuck in their extreme distortions.</p> <p>The truth is that time passes and Bacon no longer comes across as the master of the bloody chamber, of images of torture and degradation the like of which had never before been seen in British art. This is partly because he is practically an old master by now, sanctified in museums the world over, his newness erased by familiarity, his revelations superseded by the pictures of real-life horror that flood into our living rooms. But it is also because what he made of his subject matter now seems so much more important - and this is the true action of the paintings: Bacon's obsessive reinvention and restatement of those isolated figures in their cages and cells.</p> <p>A very early work from 1945, for instance, shows a howling woman bent over naked, a man's overcoat slung across her hindquarters. It is a subject fit for any number of 20th-century artists. But what makes it so devastating here is some sort of nerve-wracking tension between the ravishing orange backdrop and the disembodied mouth with its animal teeth, between the beautifully described tweed of the coat and the outlandish body forms, anticipating David Lynch's Eraserhead by 30 years. And all capped by a funereal umbrella: once seen, never forgotten.</p> <p>It is a tremendous piece of image-coining and there are so many others in this show, the screaming popes immured in their thrones, the stripped child lolloping on all fours, the dog straining at its chain in the drowning darkness. And put like this, the irresistible comparison ought to be Goya. But the stylishness, the sheer operatic charge of these works has nothing to do with the Spaniard, no matter that Bacon studied the old masters from first to last, harking back to them in his heavy gold frames.</p> <p>Often, Bacon's showmanship is deliberately apparent. The way he uses the rough reverse of the canvas, the colour seeping into the hessian like blood - burnt orange, royal purple, midnight blue, crimson - or congealing stickily on the surface. The way he keeps every flailing figure in check with a precise geometry of glass boxes, elliptical arenas, the vertical striations of those dividing curtains at the back that suggest that this is just the ante-chamber to something worse.</p> <p>Look at a particularly camp pope in a monocle - one revelation here is of Bacon's humour - wedged to the waist in his chair like Winnie in Happy Days (Bacon, incidentally, precedes Beckett) and you see that what appears to be an accidental black spatter has been primped up with red so that it looks as if the painting itself spurts blood. </p> <p>But it is what Bacon does to the figures themselves that resists analysis. The curators of this show have reconstructed the photo-plastered walls of his London studio, about which so much nonsense has been written as if Bacon simply transcribed Eisenstein, Eadweard Muybridge, photos of Nuremberg, textbook shots of mouth diseases or patients positioned for X-rays. This proves crucial. It shows that Bacon never paints an exact moment of violence, nor its aftermath, nor anything captured in a photograph; he invents some split-second transition - his characteristic stop-start mutation.</p> <p>And where do those wildly aberrant faces come from? They might recall Henry Tonks's studies of First World War soldiers, but Bacon is not recording actual injuries; and this is not just some new variant of modernism either. The eyes want to straighten them out, these heads, put them back together. But the mind cannot.</p> <p>One of the greatest works here is also the smallest, a portrait of Bacon's lover George Dyer. A nearby photograph shows the same handsome profile, the curved nose echoed by the gleaming black quiff. But the painting, with its swerves and swipes, despite being instantly recognisable, is another thing altogether. Photo-real yet caricatural, molten but graphic, muscular and yet diaphanous, it moves seamlessly through its transitions. Whatever Dyer once was before his suicide, he has become a force-field of deathless matter.</p> <p>No stories, only images: that was Bacon's claim for his art and even though the late works seem to imply a narrative with their props and locations - the hotel, the telephone, a door flung open, a man hunched over a mirror - they never resolve into simple conclusions. His images are indelible, irrational and beyond summary, and his modest ambition for them - that they should be as vividly realised as possible - has surely turned out to be true.</p>",
  "<p>Marcus Trescothick has been one of England's finest opening batsmen, with 76 Tests and 123 one-day internationals to his name. Yet at the age of 32, when batsmen have just reached their peak, he is now confined to the domestic circuit, where this summer he has been pummelling county bowlers in between rainstorms. This book attempts to explain why.</p> <p>Trescothick, almost uniquely, was never dropped by England from the day he made his debut in July 2000 to his final international appearance in September 2006. But towards the end of that career he was often absent from the side. The reason, we discover in sometimes harrowing detail, was because he suffers from depression, triggered by his separation from home and family. </p> <p>On three occasions he had to flee for home when he was supposed to be representing club or country: from India and Sydney in 2006, and from the Dixon's electrical store in Gatwick in March 2008. The final instance, when his county team, Somerset, were about to depart on a pre-season tour to Dubai, prompted him to announce his retirement from international cricket. He could not bring himself to board the plane.</p> <p>Trescothick may not be a man of broad interests. Cricket has always been his life. But he had a tale to tell even before the onset of his illness. A precocious youngster, who scored 4,000 runs in a season as a 15-year-old in 1991 (his mum counted them all up), he progressed into an England side that went on to become one of the best in the game's history. The team's achievements culminated in the 2005 Ashes triumph, which enthralled the nation. </p> <p>It was Trescothick who launched the assault on Australia in 2005. With England already 1-0 down after defeat at Lord's, the circus moved on to Birmingham. Just before the start of the match, Glenn McGrath trod on a cricket ball, injuring his ankle and ruling himself out of the match, and subsequently prompting this thanksgiving from Lord MacLaurin at a celebratory cricket dinner: 'Our final thanks before we eat for the ball you placed beneath Glenn's feet.' </p> <p>Trescothick cracked 90 at Edgbaston, which delivered the message that this England side was not lying down. It ignited the summer, a defiant innings from a player who Nasser Hussain has described as the 'most selfless' of cricketers. No one speaks badly of Trescothick.</p> <p>Yet this is not the story Trescothick and his ghostwriter, Peter Hayter, really yearn to tell. The cricket is dutifully, though routinely, covered in the first half of the book. But there are not as many insights as we might expect. For example, Trescothick was often regarded as 'Duncan's boy' since he spent so much time under the tutelage of Duncan Fletcher, England's coach throughout this period. Yet we learn little new about the enigmatic Zimbabwean. By contrast, the recollection of Trescothick's anguish in Baroda and elsewhere is compelling and the depth of his despair often shocking. </p> <p>The sporting world, more than any other, is unsympathetic to those who show signs of weakness or unorthodoxy. Indeed Trescothick, ill-advised and out of control, initially chose to lie about his condition in a TV interview after his return from India rather than admit to any form of mental illness. This makes his subsequent honesty in recounting his depression all the more admirable.</p> <p>His battle with the 'black wings' of depression is the kernel of the book and the account of his illness is far more captivating than any of the cricketing triumphs. Hayter, who has worked successfully with Ian Botham and Phil Tufnell in the past, would have recognised that this is what separates Trescothick's story from a run-of-the-mill autobiography.</p> <p>There was a time when Hayter might have been one of the 'just pull yourself together brigade', but recently he has endured some of the same torment as Trescothick, so he has a peculiar understanding of what his subject has been through. He told me that when they were working together on the book 'we kept finishing one another's sentences'. This shared experience must contribute to the vividness of those passages where Trescothick is reelingly out of control.</p> <p>The candour of one of our leading sportsmen may well help those who suffer from a similar illness, but that is not the aim of the book. The writing process has had, by his own admission, a cathartic effect upon Trescothick, and it may be no coincidence that in the weeks prior to publication he has been batting sublimely for his county. More importantly, as he does the publicity rounds, he has been smiling.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Vic Marks is a former England cricketer and cricket correspondent of The Observer</p>",
  "<p>Nick Clegg is heading for a stormy first conference as Liberal Democrat leader as his party today dramatically ditches its hardline pro-European stance as part of a sweeping overhaul of policy.</p> <p>In an interview with The Observer, Vince Cable, the Lib Dem treasury spokesman, abandoned the party's historic commitment to 'ever closer' European integration and its decade-long push for rapid British entry into the euro system.</p> <p>Prompting a furious response from the party's pro-European wing, Cable steered them on to a more Eurosceptic course in the hope of preventing a haemorrhage of votes at the next election to the traditionally anti-Brussels Conservative party.</p> <p>With Clegg's full blessing, Cable dropped a commitment that was at the heart of successive Lib Dem election manifestos, saying it would be pointless to hold a referendum on entry into the euro as it is 'perfectly obvious' one 'could not be won. We would not give it (a campaign to adopt the euro) priority. We are not pushing for early entry'. He said: 'I sometimes use the visual image that it is a ship that has sailed out of the harbour. There is no point in jumping into the sea and swimming after it.'</p> <p>Implying that he and his party were wrong to have pushed for entry into the euro for the past decade, Cable suggested that handing control of interest rates to the European Central Bank may have contributed to property price 'bubbles' in some eurozone countries, including Spain. 'There are various things that we have learnt about euroland, and about the eurozone, which are clearly problems that need to be resolved,' he said.</p> <p>He denied that the party had abandoned its core pro-EU beliefs. But in an extraordinary shift he said it would campaign for a more decentralised, less bureaucratic EU in next year's European elections. 'There are things wrong with it [the EU]. The CAP [common agricultural policy] is a complete disgrace. We think there is a lot of institutional reform that is necessary. I think when we get to the European elections next year this will be a key message.'</p> <p>The change of tack will delight those Lib Dems who argue that their efforts to defeat the Tories, particularly in the south west of England, will be severely hampered by the party's pro-euro policies.</p> <p>But there was a furious response from pro-Europeans, who predicted a stormy debate on Europe on Tuesday. Chris Davies, a Liberal Democrat MEP and former leader of its group in the European Parliament, said the change risked destroying the party's reputation for standing up for controversial policies and sticking to its principles.</p> <p>'This is a very good recipe for coming fifth in the European elections,' Davies said, adding that it was also the way to make the party 'disappear out of sight'. Unless the Lib Dem leader, a former European Commission official with a long history of support for European integration and UK entry into the euro, stood by his pro-Europeanism, he risked becoming 'irrelevant'. 'He will need to be bold if he is to be noticed,' Davies argues in an article published today.</p> <p>Cable said he also expects a row in Bournemouth over plans to slash public spending by up to \u00a320bn and cut the overall tax burden over an economic cycle. The economic plan - again designed to outflank the Tories - reverses the party's traditional commitment to higher spending and increases in taxation for the well-off.</p> <p>Under the Clegg-Cable plans, public spending would be cut overall from the levels under Labour by identifying projects that can be scrapped, including the Eurofighter and ID cards, improving others such as the tax credit system and identifying waste.</p> <p>Green taxes and new measures to stop tax avoidance would also help to fund tax cuts aimed at lower earners. The reductions would be introduced either by raising thresholds or by cutting the basic rate of tax - or by a combination of the two.</p> <p>Cable said: 'A decade ago, the public mood as we read it was that people wanted to pay a bit more in tax ... because they could see that schools and hospitals had been badly neglected by the Tories, and we were at the front of the argument that more money should go in. </p> <p>'But far more public spending has gone in in real terms than we argued for, and much of it has been well used - and we are proud to defend it,' he added. 'But now we have got to a point where there are seriously diminishing returns. Now people want to keep more of their own money and see it used productively.'</p>",
  "<p>They had come close to paying off their mortgage when they lost their home. But if the final payment was tantalisingly close, Michael and Henrietta Spink's debts loomed closer and the family house had to be sold. 'We have lost everything, we have been thoroughly rogered and screwed, we have lost our home and have been brought to our knees,' said Henrietta bluntly. 'No one would really believe what a terrible joke the system is until they have tried it.'</p> <p>Along with her husband, she is one of Britain's six million carers who are saving the government an estimated \u00a387m a year by looking after the sick and the disabled and are constantly fighting to stay one step ahead of financial ruin. </p> <p>Spink, a mother who has not slept through the night in 20 years, says she calculated recently that she has changed 60,000 nappies for her profoundly disabled children, Henry, now 20, and Freddie, 16. There's no self-pity there: she is laughing heartily. 'I love my boys. I am passionate about them, I can't tell you how much I love them and I can't tell you how much I am driven to do the best for them that I possibly can,' she said. </p> <p>'Henry just never woke up from birth until he was three; it's as though he is living in a transcendental meditative state. When you're pregnant you have the dream, the school, the grandchildren, you map it all out. Then suddenly the slate is wiped clean and the canvas is a black one, very scary. But I have learnt that a lot of love does take away some of that darkness.'</p> <p>It may well be that the next generation of carers benefits from the battles of this family as now their experiences have been taken on in a way that gives a little hope to the unpaid army of people who care for society's sick and disabled. Articulate about the disastrously unlinked-up services and woeful loopholes in present legislation, the Spinks wrote a letter to the Law Commission, the body charged with examining and recommending changes to the UK's statute books. </p> <p>It struck a chord and has just been announced as one of the Law Commission's key new projects. It will be three years at least before the commission will report back to Parliament and far longer before any recommendations are voted on to the statute books, but it will force social care on to the political agenda.</p> <p>For Henrietta, 46, a former classical book binder, and Michael, 51, an Islamic and Asian expert for an art and auction house, it's a little victory in a war that has shaped their whole lives. They had both managed to keep working until their second son, Freddie, was born missing half his diaphragm and with his organs in the wrong places. Freddie spent his babyhood on a life-support system.</p> <p>Developmentally delayed, he now has profound autism and can be very destructive. He wakes frequently in the night and projectile-vomits - a constriction in his throat means he is in constant danger of choking.</p> <p>Henry can have 20 epileptic fits a day and needs two adults to feed him: one to hold the spoon, the other to hold him back from making an involuntary gesture which sends plates and spoons flying.</p> <p>'Families and friends do fade away when you have a disabled child. Most relatives will offer a bit of babysitting when children are small, but ours are in permanent babyhood and people do run a mile. It saddens me and it's a lonely state of affairs. But my unforgiving anger is reserved for local authorities, for the government, for countless MPs and officials who will not face up to the fact that families like ours are being driven into the ground. Assessment after assessment after assessment, they cost thousands of pounds. It's not joined-up thinking, ever, and people are totally in the dark about where to turn. </p> <p>'Its soul-destroying. A lot of kids go into care for the lack of that little bit of extra support. We were first offered help when Henry was five and Freddie two. We were exhausted by that point and beside ourselves that we might get some help. They came and assessed us and assessed us again and finally came back and said we could have eight hours' help with laundry - at that point we were, as we are now, doing six loads of washing a day. I was delighted. Until it dawned they meant eight hours a year. Quickly you learn that with a disabled child you have to take a pill that says sense of humour on it, because it's a complete joke.'</p> <p>The couple had their first-ever respite weekend when Henry was 15. 'We had to go to court to force our local authority to send our son to the school which catered for his needs. The school that actually catered to his needs was cheaper than the one they wanted, but we could not get them to see that. Henry had no school for six months while Freddie was having ongoing major surgery; it was a desperate time. We won, Wandsworth council [in south London] had to admit they had got their figures wrong. But then all they were required to do was say sorry. We were left with a \u00a320,000 court bill; that was the beginning of our financial downfall really.</p> <p>'We are two professional people with the ability to make a noise and look at where this family has got in fighting the system - we have never had our needs met, never. We've just moved from fighting for disabled children to fighting for adults. Its really, really sad. Morally, I just believe we as a country should be looking after people who can't look after themselves,' she said.</p> <p>The hidden plight of Britain's carers has only recently been acknowledged by any government. The 2001 census was the first time figures were attempted to be collated on how many there were. The Carers (Equal Opportunities) Act 2004 addressed carers' work, learning and leisure opportunities, and the Work and Families Act 2006 gave the right to flexible working. The government ploughed about \u00a3225m into special provisions earlier this year. </p> <p>But carers all say the system is not working, that the most gruelling part of their lives is dealing with a huge wall of red tape and bureaucracy across the health, social and benefit services. </p> <p>There are charities who, as a last resort, will quietly advise desperate parents of disabled children to take them to social services and leave them in the office, because under those circumstances the law is actually clear on where the responsibility to assess their needs lies. 'I have been advised to do that, as have others I know,' said Henrietta Spink, 'to drop them on the doorstep of social services. But I never could find it in myself to do that to the boys, even as a gesture. It's quite cruel. They are human beings and how could I look into my sons' faces and walk away. But I understand how people do, though.'</p> <p>The tales from people like the Spinks are endless and exhausting. The system is not just failing them, but making things worse: assessors being assessed, forms being ticked and the law being misunderstood or taken to mean something never intended, blatant dishonesty from local authorities keen to balance budgets and wriggle out of responsibilities. </p> <p>Henry Spink, being carried up the stairs several times a day by his 5ft 2in mother, was denied a stairlift on a tick list of reasons which included 'being unable to operate the lift himself'. People waiting endlessly for letters that do not arrive or being referred from department to department. Many give up completely and slip below the radar, until they themselves get ill. Frustration, loneliness and financial hardship dog their lives. </p> <p>Carers are from all walks of life and of all ages. There are an estimated 175,000 child carers in Britain for example. 'Too often carers struggle for years to get the services they need and the endless battling can leave them exhausted and feeling completely let down by the system,' said Imelda Redmond, chief executive of the charity Carers UK. 'Carers make a huge contribution to society but get very little recognition or reward in return. </p> <p>'The rules around care and the way they are applied are aimed at keeping people out of the system rather than looking at the needs of the family as a whole and offering them the support they need. In many areas of the country only those with the most severe needs get any kind of assistance from their local authority. This can be shortsighted because often with a bit of support the carer could continue in paid work or education and the person being cared for could have more independence. As a result, the family's quality of life would be transformed and their long-term prospects improved.'</p> <p>Poverty is a huge problem for people who find themselves with a sick or disabled relative. Not only do people have to give up jobs but they also face higher heating, laundry, food and transport costs. There is a carer's allowance of \u00a350.55 a week, but it is denied to anyone who gets any other sort of benefits, or is on a pension or has a part-time job earning more than \u00a395 a week.</p> <p>At the end of last month Parliament's work and pensions select committee published a report recommending an overhaul of the benefits system and an increase in carers' allowance to \u00a360.50 a week to go some way to compensating carers, with top-up payments of up to \u00a350 a week to cover their expenses. Terry Rooney MP, the committee chairman, said sustaining the ability of carers to provide the care and support they gave to others was of critical importance.</p> <p>The Department for Work and Pensions had a duty 'to provide adequate financial support for those who provide care when of working age, either by compensating them for the extra costs of caring, or, if they need to give up work to care, through adequate income replacement and pension protection mechanisms.'</p> <p>That would add an extra \u00a3130m to the country's welfare budget. It is not a huge amount in the great scheme of things - it is the same amount, for example, that absent fathers are estimated to owe the state in child support - but carers insist that there is a great deal that could be done to improve their lives that would cost little or nothing.</p> <p>Professor Sue Yeandle, a sociologist at the University of Leeds, has been researching issues around carers for a decade and was a special adviser to the work and pensions select committtee. She says there are three 'penalties' for people who take on unpaid care. 'They become poor, their health deteroriates, and there is a tendency for them to become socially excluded,' she said.</p> <p>'Stress and low-level depression from the isolation just gets worse when they are having to fight with the system.' People with disabled children are getting a particularly raw deal, she said. 'There are pockets of good practice in local authorities, but there are enormous problems in many authorities with them constantly looking to their budgets and resisting or misunderstanding what the law expects from them. Many are not carrying out their responsibilities in an acceptable way and I know that is recognised in central government. </p> <p>'But actually there are quite a lot of things that would make a huge difference to the lives of carers that are not at all massively expensive. Simplifying the system and simplfying access to information are absolutely key. My personal opinion is that we are moving in the right direction of travel with legislation, but I do have concerns about the implementation and the speed of change.'</p> <p>Future legislation is a little late for Dipti Chakrabarti, who has been a carer for 39 years. She does not have the enduring upbeat energy of Henrietta Spink. Perhaps she did once. </p> <p>She is worn down far beyond her 64 years that she says 'has been no life at all'. A master's degree in chemistry gathers dust among her long-discarded ambitions. In 1969 she came to this country from India, newly wed to a barrister, to take up a scholarship and continue her studies. It never happened. Instead an unbroken line of family illnesses defined her entire life. First, she looked after her husband, who died in 1984, then her son, who suffered from bone cancer and died in 1996 at the age of 19, and almost immediately afterwards her mother had a bad fall and her health has declined ever since. </p> <p>Now she herself suffers from high blood pressure, ailing eyesight and arthritis, a package of ill health linked to her years of struggling on the breadline to care for others. The widow's pension she received bars her from getting any further carer's benefit, and with her 82-year-old mother to look after she cannot work. Her 34-year-old cooker is on the blink and it distresses her deeply that she is unable to keep a smart, tidy home: she has not been able to buy a new set of curtains for more than 25 years.</p> <p>At the moment, she is waiting for her mother to return home from a nursing home where she has been since suffering a heart attack. 'I visit her every day so I can take her pur\u00e9ed foods and talk to her in her own language.

  "<p>Some mothers will be able to check from tomorrow whether their partners are convicted sex offenders. Under pilot projects being introduced in response to demands for a 'Sarah's Law', individuals will be given greater information about paedophiles living in their area. </p> <p>But public protection experts and children's charities have questioned the value of the projects. They warn that the sharing of the information could lead to mob justice and cause paedophiles to adopt lower profiles, making them more difficult to monitor.</p> <p>The pilots will be run by four police forces over the next year in Warwickshire, Cambridgeshire, Cleveland and Hampshire, during which the government will assess their value. Parents and guardians will be able to request limited information about people who come into close contact with their children. </p> <p>But it will be up to local authorities and police forces to consider the request and to decide what information, if any, they will disclose. Those who receive confidential information will be warned not to share it with others. 'We will have to wait and see if the pilot programmes help to keep children safe from sex offenders and do not just create a false sense of security,' said Diana Sutton, head of policy at the NSPCC. 'We strongly urge people to remain alert to the fact that not all child abusers have criminal records, because many are not caught and charged with an offence. Someone might be given a clean bill of health by police because they do not have a criminal record, but may still pose a threat to children. </p> <p>'Disclosing information to specific parties is just one strand of a wider management system which still lacks proper funding and manpower.' </p> <p>'Sarah's Law', named after Sarah Payne, the eight-year-old girl who was murdered by the convicted paedophile Roy Whiting in 2000, is partly inspired by Megan's Law in the US, brought in after the rape and murder of Megan Kanka, seven, in 1994. </p> <p>Under Megan's Law, individual states decide what information will be made available about paedophiles and how it will be disseminated. The information that can be shared with local communities includes the offender's name, picture, address and nature of their crime. Often the information is displayed on public websites, in newspapers and in leaflets through letterboxes.</p> <p>Sarah's parents, Sara and Michael, have insisted that, if a Megan's Law had been operating in the UK, their daughter would not have died. Their argument was taken up by the News of the World, which launched a campaign to have the law introduced to the UK.</p> <p>In response, John Reid, then Home Secretary, promised last year that the government would introduce the pilot schemes as part of a 'radical' package to protect young people. He said the pilots would introduce a 'presumption' that police would tell a mother that her partner was a registered sex offender.</p> <p>At the time he denied the initiative was a form of Megan's Law, which goes much further in sharing information with a local community than is intended with the four UK pilot projects. 'What we did want to do was address the campaign that Sara Payne put forward among others. If someone wants to call that Sarah's Law, then I am delighted for her.'</p>",
  "<p>One of Britain's biggest investors will launch a campaign this week to persuade Shell and BP to drop their plans for heavy investment in oil sands and shale projects in North America.</p> <p>Co-operative Asset Management is concerned that the huge environmental costs of producing crude from oil sands or shale could change the economics of these so-called 'unconventional' fuel sources, putting the oil companies and their investors at risk of a huge wasted investment.</p> <p>Paul Monaghan, head of sustainability and social goals at the Co-op, points to research showing that extracting oil from shale creates eight times as many emissions as conventional oil production, while oil sands produce three times as much. While these sources are economic at current oil prices, a fall in crude or a rise in the price of carbon under the trading system could make them much more expensive. </p> <p>'The worry is that, within five years, it will be unstoppable,' said Monaghan. 'I think it is stoppable now.'</p> <p>The Co-op will enlist the support of other large institutional investors at a seminar outlining the issues this week. Niall O'Shea, a responsible shareholding analyst, said: 'We believe that companies investing heavily in unconventionals are too focused on short-term profit and their strategy is too defensive. They are becoming increasingly expensive to produce.'</p> <p>Shell is already committed to a $16bn (\u00a38.9bn) project aimed at generating 15 per cent of its production from unconventionals, while BP's investment is around $6bn. The amount of oil available is huge - the Canadian sands alone, situated largely in the province of Alberta, have around twice the total reserves of Saudi Arabia.</p> <p>The companies say that the higher emissions will be mitigated by carbon capture and storage schemes, but O'Shea says these will not be in operation until 2020. 'Oil sands [production] will be out long before that.' </p> <p>The exploitation of the oil sands is controversial even within North America. According to polls, some two thirds of Albertans support a moratorium on new projects until new environmental standards are in place. But the state government in Alberta is keen to attract investment from oil companies, leaving them to largely determine how to regulate their activities. As a result, critics say, the environmental rules are lax and loosely enforced.</p> <p>In the US, legislators have proposed a law which could restrict imports of the most polluting types of fossil fuels, such as that from oil sands. But Greg Stringham of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers dismissed this move as 'rhetoric': 'I do not think the US is in a position to choose what kind of oil it gets. The US has spoken a lot about energy security, so it will not want to jeopardise supplies from Canada - a safe, close, and growing source.'</p>",
  "<p>Throughout the year-long credit crisis, the men who run America's economy have behaved like all-action heroes, blasting the problem with every weapon they've got. David Rosenberg of Merrill Lynch described US Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson's bold rescue of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae last week as 'bringing out the bazooka', but if Paulson's all-guns-blazing approach made him seem like the financial equivalent of Bruce Willis, it left Alistair Darling, with his modest housing rescue plans, looking more like Mr Micawber - hoping desperately that 'something will turn up'.</p> <p>Ben Bernanke at the Federal Reserve has slashed US interest rates from 5.25 per cent to 2 per cent - compared to a measly three cuts from Mervyn King at the Bank of England. And Congress rapidly stitched together a massive $150bn (\u00a386bn) package of tax cuts, dwarfing the \u00a31.7bn Darling rustled up to smooth over the chaotic abolition of the 10p tax rate.</p> <p>Paulson, meanwhile, has opened up taxpayers' coffers to lend directly to struggling investment banks; brokered the cut-price fire sale of Bear Stearns in a matter of days; and finally, last weekend, seized control of giant lenders Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, to prevent the entire US mortgage market collapsing. While Darling, Gordon Brown and Mervyn King took several agonising months to pounce on Northern Rock and nationalise it, the US Treasury has acted at breakneck speed.</p> <p>The no-expense-spared rescue of Fannie and Freddie, which could cost Washington $300bn or even more, raises the pressure on Darling to attack Britain's economic crisis with greater firepower. However, analysts say it would be a mistake to follow America's lead. Jonathan Loynes, chief European economist at consultancy Capital Economics, says Paulson's latest gamble is an indication that other repeated attempts to revive the US economy and restore some semblance of normality to its financial system have been failures.</p> <p>'It was an absolute emergency measure, done only when it was clear that the alternative was the collapse of the entire financial system,' he says. 'You don't nationalise the mortgage system unless it's the absolute last resort: let's hope we never get into those circumstances ourselves.'</p> <p>In the UK, there is already growing alarm about the pace of the decline in house prices - and the sharp reduction in the availability of mortgage loans, as crisis-hit banks try to rebuild their balance sheets. Markets for the mortgage-backed assets which banks had been using to fund much of their lending remain almost completely closed.</p> <p>James Crosby, the former boss of HBOS, is due to report to the Chancellor by the end of the month on whether the government should try to unlock these frozen markets. The Special Liquidity Scheme - the temporary financial support for lenders introduced six months ago - is due to expire in mid-October, and banks have warned the Treasury that without some extension the mortgage drought is doomed to continue. Some estimates suggest they have borrowed more than \u00a3200bn from the scheme.</p> <p>Bank of England Governor Mervyn King used his appearance before MPs at the Treasury select committee on Thursday to sketch the outlines of a permanent 'liquidity insurance scheme', full details of which will be revealed this week. King has made it clear that he would fiercely oppose any decision to use taxpayers' cash to finance new mortgage lending, in an attempt to slow house-price decline. </p> <p>Diana Choyleva, of consultancy Lombard Street Research, argues that for the government to underwrite new mortgage lending would be 'like taking a drunk to the liquor store'. The average household now has debts worth more than a year and a half's income - more than in any other G7 country. The savings ratio - the share of their pay people are squirrelling away - is 1.1 per cent, its lowest level since the Fifties.</p> <p>'It has dawned on people that these credit problems are not going to go away any time soon,' Choyleva says. </p> <p>Loynes says the answer will eventually have to be a cut in interest rates - which the Chancellor can no longer make. With oil prices sliding, and the cost of other commodities also beginning to fall, there are rising hopes that King and his colleagues will feel able to make more cuts soon - perhaps as early as November. And as hopes grow of cheaper rates, there are some signs of life returning to the mortgage markets. Several lenders reduced rates last week, albeit for borrowers who can put up a large deposit. </p> <p>Some analysts say the US rescue in itself should help to ease problems elsewhere, and bring confidence back to financial markets. 'Irrespective of any potential moves by governments in the UK, Spain, Ireland or elsewhere we believe that, on balance, the US government intervention will prove to be a real turning point,' says Jeremy Tighe, manager of Foreign and Colonial Investment Trust. 'Our view is supported by the fact that last week UK blue chips were yielding more than 10-year gilts, something which over the last 50 years has proven to be a good buying signal.'</p> <p>Perhaps these tentative signs of optimism suggest that if Darling is willing to hold his nerve something may indeed turn up. But Loynes points out that the slow, painful unfolding of the US downturn over the past two years also teaches us that even all-action heroes can't prevent the inevitable. 'The one lesson from this is that even if the Bank slashed interest rates aggressively, in a year or two's time we might still have a major problem,' he says.</p>",
  "<p>Mervyn King, the governor of the Bank of England, will be forced to write another explanatory letter to the Chancellor on Tuesday, as official figures confirm that inflation has been stuck above 3 per cent for four months in a row.</p> <p>King must write to the Chancellor when inflation jumps more than 1 per cent above the government's 2 per cent target and do so again if it remains there for three months. He sent a letter in June - only the second in the Bank's 11 years of controlling interest rates - and analysts say it is almost certain he will have to write another this week.</p> <p>Rising inflation, fuelled by high oil prices, has prevented the Bank from offsetting the economic slowdown by cutting interest rates, which have been stuck at 5 per cent since April.</p> <p>Michael Saunders, of Citigroup, predicted that Tuesday's figures would show inflation hit 4.7 per cent in August, helped by sharply rising fuel bills - and that King would have to write another three letters by next summer.</p> <p>'I think inflation is going to hit a plateau, not a sharp peak,' he said, adding that being forced to explain what they were doing to bring inflation under control could make it difficult for the Bank's monetary policy committee to reduce interest rates in the near future. 'They could cut while they're writing letters, but it's hard for them to explain.'</p> <p>On Friday, Bank deputy governor Paul Tucker said the MPC had to balance the risk of rising inflation in the near term against the fear that it could drop well below the 2 per cent target next year as the economy slows. He said the public's perception of higher prices was a crucial factor for the MPC, which is nervous that workers will bid up their wages, allowing inflation to become entrenched.</p>",
  "<p>Everybody needs support at some time or another. So if you have had the brush-off from a shop that refused to replace a faulty item because the warranty had expired, or your neighbour's hellishly loud parties keep you awake every night, you need to know your Magnificent Seven Consumer Rights: <br><strong><br>1. No warranty, no problem </strong></p> <p>Usually a shop will say that if a faulty item bought there is under warranty it is the manufacturer's responsibility, and if no longer under warranty it is your problem. This is untrue. Under the Sale of Goods Act 1979, the shop selling an item is responsible for it being 'fit for purpose'. One aspect of this is reasonable durability - so if your freezer dies much earlier than most people would expect it to, the shop is liable to repair or replace it or offer you a full or partial refund. Reasonable life is a grey area, but if that freezer lasted less than, say, four years, you would have a good case. Ultimately, it would be up to the courts to decide, but bringing an action via Moneyclaim Online (www.moneyclaim.gov.uk), the service which begins civil claims through the small claims procedure, is surprisingly easy and initiating the action is likely to make the shop give in.<br><strong><br>2. Where did the beach go? </strong></p> <p> A package holiday is a service like any other and has to conform to the Trades Descriptions Act 1968. So if you pay for a hotel 'a five-minute walk from the beach', it has to be a five-minute walk. If it is described as a 'quiet, small family-oriented resort', it cannot be full of clubbers, with no facilities for children. Your claim will be with the tour operator, not the travel agent or hotel.</p> <p><strong>3. Second-hand doesn't mean second-rate</strong> </p> <p>If you buy a second-hand good from a shop, the Sale of Goods Act still applies. It must work and last as long as it is reasonable to expect it to - a second-hand item will usually last less time than a new one. When buying from a private individual, however, the act does not apply. Your only useful right is that the description must not be misleading.</p> <p><strong>4. Let the train take the strain</strong> </p> <p>If you have bought a ticket and your journey is delayed by more than an hour due to circumstances within the control of the operator (this does not include adverse weather conditions), under the companies' various passenger charters you are entitled to compensation in the form of travel vouchers. Conditions within the company's control would include failure to employ enough drivers, for instance, but exclude removing a train from service due to vandalism. Legally, industrial action is outside its control, but most operators will compensate voluntarily. </p> <p><strong>5. Food for thought</strong></p> <p>When you order a meal in a restaurant, you are making a contract covered by the Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982. The restaurant is agreeing to provide the food it advertised in a manner in which it is reasonable to expect it. As well as being of a decent standard, it must arrive in good time, be served by waiters who aren't too rude (service must be provided 'with reasonable care and skill') and the ambience must be up to scratch. So if you go to a fine French restaurant you shouldn't be expected to pay in full if your visit was spoiled by the rugby club outing at the next table.</p> <p><strong>6. Never darken my doorstep again</strong></p> <p>The Cancellation of Contracts Concluded Away from Business Premises Regulations 1987 means that if you agree to buy something worth more than \u00a335 from someone who has turned up at your home unsolicited you have seven days to cancel for a full refund. The regulations are being extended in October to cover you in some circumstances if the sale takes place outside your home and the meeting was solicited - don't miss the Cancellation of Contracts Made in a Consumer's Home or Place of Work etc Regulations 2008.</p> <p><strong>7. Beggar thy neighbour</strong></p> <p>Under the Weeds Act 1959 your neighbours are responsible for preventing certain nasty plants from entering your garden from theirs. These include spear thistle and ragwort. You have the right to trim back a hedge growing into your garden, but must provide the owner with the cuttings (or you are committing a theft!). A tree's owner is liable for damage if it falls onto your beloved conservatory or pet. The Noise Act 1996 makes it easier to prevent loud neighbours making your life hell. Keep a noise diary and alert your council's environmental health team.</p>",
  "<p>An new law making it quicker for banks, credit card companies and other lenders to take action against struggling debtors could lead to thousands more people losing their homes, say debt advisers. The rules will make it easier for lenders to use charging orders to convert unsecured borrowing, such as car loans or credit card debts, into loans 'secured' against the home of someone who owes them money. Once a charging order has been used to convert an unsecured loan into a secured loan, the lender can then force the homeowner to sell their home to pay back the debt.</p> <p>At the moment, creditors can apply for a charging order only where a debtor has incurred a county court judgment and has fallen behind with the repayment instalments agreed when the judgment was made. But under the new rules, lenders will be able to apply for a charging order simply because a county court judgment has been issued, irrespective of whether or not a debtor is sticking to an agreed repayment schedule. If the debtor then falls into arrears with repayments, the creditor can immediately use the charging order to ask the court to force a sale of the debtor's home.</p> <p>The rule change is contained in the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007, which has passed into law but has yet to be brought into effect. The Ministry of Justice says a timetable for the introduction of secondary legislation giving the act effect will be announced 'in due course'. The Lord Chancellor will set a minimum threshold of debt - expected to be \u00a31,000 - below which a charging order or order for sale may not be issued. This should protect homeowners struggling with small amounts of debt from losing their properties. </p> <p>There were more than a million county court judgments in 2006 and debt advice charities are worried that the change in the law could result in a flood of applications for charging orders from lenders keen to recoup cash as a result of the credit crunch. This in turn could lead to a sharp rise in the number of debtors forced to sell their homes.</p> <p>'There is likely to be a big increase in orders for sale if this change in the law comes into force, because once a charging order is in place, a lender is free to apply for an order for sale as soon as someone falls behind with payments on the loan secured against their home,' says Alex McDermott, policy officer at Citizens Advice.</p> <p>Rick and Laura (not their real names) ran up unsecured debts with Nationwide building society totalling almost \u00a314,000 - a combination of credit cards and overdrafts. Nationwide took them to court for a \u00a39,000 credit card debt, seeking immediate repayment of the full amount and a charging order. </p> <p>'They tried to get a charging order straight away and were hassling us every day for all the money, which we had no way of paying, even ringing me at work,' says Rick. 'We wanted to pay back the debt as part of a debt management plan, but Nationwide refused to negotiate.'</p> <p>The Consumer Credit Counselling Service (CCCS) intervened on the couple's behalf and Nationwide was obliged by a judge to accept monthly instalments of \u00a348.45 and refused a charging order. Because Rick and Laura have kept up with the repayments, they are protected from a charging order under current rules; Nationwide can apply for one only if they fall behind with the instalments.</p> <p>However, Mark Norman, senior debt adviser at CCCS, says that under the new rules, the outcome for the couple could have been very different. 'Rick and Laura had a number of unsecured loans with Nationwide, and if the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act had been in force, they could have expected to see up to four charging orders placed on their property,' he says. 'The building society has been aggressive in its approach to recouping the loans, so a charging order would have put their home at considerable risk.'</p> <p>A spokesman for Nationwide said: 'It is in the interests of both the member and ourselves to get the payments back on track in a mutually agreeable way. Taking court action is always a last resort and we do not take this step lightly. However, we do have a duty to our wider membership to prevent or minimise any losses from accounts that have fallen into arrears.'</p> <p>Beccy Boden-Wilks, of the Money Advice Trust, points out that a charging order allows lenders to charge interest on a debt, which would give them an added incentive to exploit the change in the law, as well as resulting in extra costs for debtors. 'Interest on a debt is automatically suspended as soon as there is a county court judgment and doesn't have to be paid, even when the debt is being paid back in instalments,' she says. 'But if a creditor can get a charging order, interest on the debt has to be paid at a statutory rate of 8 per cent, making the monthly repayments higher.'</p> <p>Charging orders can also make buying and selling homes more difficult and risk slowing down an already sluggish housing market. 'We have had buyers pull out because of delays due to charging orders,' says Law Society spokeswoman and conveyancing solicitor Sheetal Bahal. 'It takes time to check how much is owed to whom and if there is enough equity to pay all the creditors. Some buyers simply can't wait for these issues to be sorted out.' </p> <p>As house prices continue to drop, there is also a risk that an increase in charging orders will result in more homeowners falling into negative equity. 'We have had cases where a sale has fallen through because there is simply not enough equity in a property to pay off all the charges,' says Bahal.</p> <p>Anthony Sharp, chair of the Central Region Civil Court Users Association, which represents creditors, acknowledges that the change in the law tips the balance in favour of creditors, but claims that this is because other changes are set to benefit debtors. 'Other elements in the act, such as introducing debt relief orders and enforcement restriction orders, have improved consumer protection,' he says.</p> <p>Sharp defends the use of charging orders, but is concerned at creditors using them to force the sale of a property. 'Charging orders are a perfectly good way of securing debt, and for years the number of orders for sale has been very small compared to the number of charging orders. But we are now seeing an increase in orders for sale, especially where an unsecured debt has been purchased by a debt recovery company.'</p> <p>Liberal Democrat deputy leader Vince Cable says the government has failed to anticipate the impact of the new law. 'I hope that the government will retreat from what was clearly not properly thought through at the stage of primary legislation. The problem of repossession was bad enough in the early 1990s. We now have the problem of sub-prime lenders, and potentially large numbers of second charge creditors, all forcing people out of their homes. The government must stop short of introducing regulation giving effect to these powers.'</p>",
  "<p>The moment when David Bowie and Andy Warhol crossed paths for the first time was preserved for posterity on a shaky hand-held camera by one of the latter's assistants, Michael Netter. The meeting took place at the Factory, Warhol's studio-cum-hangout in Manhattan on 14 September 1971. </p> <p>Bowie, who had yet to reinvent himself as one of pop's ultra-modernists, wears baggy trousers and has his long hair styled in a side parting beneath a big floppy hat. After some awkward small talk about Syd Barrett and the price of albums in America, Bowie performs a mime in which he drags his beating heart out of his chest. All the while, Warhol stands off to one side looking on as blankly as only he could, occasionally whispering to his aides. Then, Bowie and his small entourage shuffle off.</p> <p>It is not so much a meeting of two great pop minds as a cagey standoff between someone who has created a pop future in his own image and someone who, at that moment, may have suddenly realised he must do the same or be left behind. The short, black-and-white, fly-on-the-wall film of Bowie and Warhol's encounter is one of several similar fragments that make up just one section of the multimedia overload that is Andy Warhol: Other Voices, Other Rooms, a touring exhibition that opens soon at the Hayward Gallery in London.</p> <p>The show is a kaleidoscope of Warholia that includes paintings, posters, TV shows, album sleeves and interviews, as well as the famous screen tests and various snatches of his film diaries. It is a noisy, unruly, wilfully distracting event, the art show as conceptual homage and critique. It makes one wonder how the world would have looked without Warhol.</p> <p>The world of pop music would certainly have looked very different. As creative director of the Velvet Underground, perhaps the most influential rock group of all time, Warhol helped shape the pop future from early Bowie on to Kraftwerk and punk. Though he was credited as producer on The Velvet Underground and Nico album, his only direct input, apart from creating that iconic sleeve, was to pay for the studio time. Nevertheless, when Richard Goldstein wrote glowingly about the Velvets in New York magazine in 1967, he called them 'Andy's rock group'. They were seen as another Warhol-inspired idea, 'the product of a secret marriage between Bob Dylan and the Marquis de Sade'. Goldstein - wrongly, as it turned out - saw rock'n'roll as Warhol's new medium. 'Andy says he's through with phosphorescent flowers and cryptic soup cans. Now, it's rock. He may finally conquer the world through its soft teenage underbelly.'</p> <p>Warhol, for his part, saw the Velvets as a piece of kinetic art, an installation even. 'It's ugly,' he told Goldstein. 'It's an ugly effect when you put it all together. But it's beautiful. You know you just look at the whole thing - the Velvets playing and Gerard [Malanga] dancing and all the film and light, and it's a beautiful thing. Very vinyl. Beautiful.'</p> <p>More presciently still, Warhol, alongside Roy Lichtenstein, was the Pop artist as creative magpie, making the notion of creative borrowing a central motif in his work. The Campbell's soup cans, the Brillo boxes, the silkscreened prints of celebrities all heralded the age of audio sampling. In short, Warhol saw a future in which pop would endlessly eat itself and regurgitate its past in new and exciting ways. </p> <p>Twenty one years after his death, Warhol may still be the most influential invisible presence in contemporary pop, his most celebrated quote - 'in the future, everyone will be famous for 15 minutes' - now a kind of template for the current vogue for reality talent shows and created pop groups. More than that, though, Warhol saw how celebrity worked and where its worship would lead. He was an early master of PR and self-promotion, and, in his lifetime, his reputation was based as much on his public and media profile as his art.</p> <p>Andy made the rounds of openings and premieres, Andy partied (after a fashion) and Andy posed. His own magazine, Interview, tracked his every appearance in a column called 'Out', where Andy appeared in the company of Bianca Jagger, Liza Minnelli and Truman Capote. Little wonder that John Lennon called him 'the biggest publicity man in the world'.</p>",
  "<p>We all suffer unrequited crushes at high school. But not many of us turn them into multimillion-dollar-selling songs. Taylor Swift, 18, is the new face of Nashville. Tall, blonde, impossibly leggy, she is a phenomenon in the States - hailed as the country Britney Spears. A paid songwriter since the age of 14, she was the youngest performer ever to write and sing a No 1 country single, 2006's 'Our Song'. </p> <p>Swift has opened for veteran country stars Faith Hill and Tim McGraw (her first single, a slice of teen angst, was even called 'Tim McGraw'). She is the first bona fide country star of the MySpace generation. But growing up on a farm in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania, she felt an outsider. 'I first started writing songs because I was lonely and had no friends at school.' </p> <p>Music was her escape. Inspired by her grandmother, an opera singer, she began performing at karaoke contests and county fairs. By the age of 12 she had her own website. Sony put her on the payroll at 14. After her family moved to Nashville, she was spotted by music industry veteran Scott Borchetta who signed her for Big Machine Records. </p> <p>Her songs are unapologetically about boys and relationships. 'I love to over-dramatise, to take a simple thing and blow it up into some crazy scenario,' she laughs. At 5ft 11ins, she was the boys' best friend at school rather than the prom queen. But revenge is sweet. The love rat who cheated on her is immortalised in 'Should've Said No' (her second No 1). 'In my hometown there are all these theories about the guys different songs have been written about. They've become mini-celebrities.'</p> <p>In 2006 she released her self-titled debut album, which went triple platinum. While Swift has crossed over into the teen pop arena - she was Grammy-nominated as Best New Artist alongside Amy Winehouse and Feist (losing to Winehouse) - she remains loyal to country. 'You should not drift too far away from who you are.' </p> <p>As 'Good Britney', she is adored by parents. She doesn't drink or party. 'At 12 I had to choose between being popular or not messing my life up. And I think making that choice has made a permanent mark on me.' Her second album, Fearless, will be released in November and she has just played her first show in London. She refuses to use her age as a gimmick or show skin, preferring a uniform of dresses and cowboy boots. Her fans will spot any lack of authenticity. 'I think there is a fine line between writing songs that are too old for you and things you have not been through.' </p> <p>And she gives astonishingly good romantic advice. 'Always start with the intent that you want this to be a shooting-straight relationship,' she tells me firmly. 'But the second he plays that first move, play it right back.' Yes, maam.</p>",
  "<p>It was your classic Patagonian road. Dead straight to the horizon, bounded on one side by a view of turquoise lakes and shimmering mountains and on the other by the infinite steppe, and with a huge dome-shaped blue sky dappled with lenticular clouds up above. This was the Ruta 40, the only link road between the airport and the village of El Chalt\u00e9n, but it was the sort of road you make movies about and a cut above the M56.</p> <p>'Shall we stop for a coffee?' asked Pablo, my local guide. 'Sure,' I said, as I also fancied an empanada (stuffed pastry) after the three-hour flight from Buenos Aires. Our driver pulled into the first place we had seen in an hour (and the last we would see for the next two hours, as it turned out). Pablo said it was the Hotel La Leona, and since it had opened way back in 1894 - when Patagonia was barely on the map - it had served as both a hotel and a wayfarers' inn. </p> <p>It was characterful as well as splendidly isolated. Two huge wooden cart-wheels lay against a flagpole in the car park and the main building, with its reddish corrugated roof, looked a bit like an estancia (ranch).</p> <p>On the wall of La Leona were dozens of old monochrome prints. They looked like your usual nostalgia-tinged decorative prints but when I got up closer I saw they were photographs of Butch Cassidy, the Sundance Kid and Butch's beautiful squeeze, Ethel Place. 'They stopped here after robbing a bank in R\u00edo Gallegos,' explained Pablo.</p> <p>We went around the walls looking at the other pictures. There was one of Francisco Moreno, the pioneering geographer who for many Argentinians is Darwin, Drake and Captain Scott rolled into one; the hotel was named after the leona, or puma, that had reportedly attacked Moreno on one of his map-making adventures in the 1870s. Beside him was a wiry mountaineer, Alberto Mar\u00eda d'Agostini, a Salesian missionary who had scaled some of Patagonia's most fearsome peaks. 'Everyone passed through here in the old days,' said Pablo. 'And it was not far from here that Robert FitzRoy sailed upriver in one of his expeditions from the Beagle.'</p> <p>It turned out La Leona was something of a crossroads in Patagonia's rich folk history. All well and good, but I had just spent three years writing a book about this very subject, so it was a bit of a blow - La Leona wasn't even on my radar. Had I missed some vital reference point on the cultural map?</p> <p>Not really, because, if you spend any time at all in the great triangle of wilderness, glaciers, cold rainforest and icy peaks at the bottom of the Americas, you are bound to stumble upon the memories of conquistadors, sailors, adventurers and travel writers. After all, before the Panama canal and aeroplanes, both southern Argentina and southern Chile were stopovers on global shipping lines and, with or without the traders, Patagonia has always attracted vagrants and miscreants. That evening, we were staying in the village of El Chalt\u00e9n, which takes its name from a nearby mountain; the word is native Tehuelche for 'smoking mountain' in reference to the clouds of snow that whirl around its summit, and which the Indians may have thought were volcanic plumes.</p> <p>The common room of our grand ranch-style hotel, Los Cerros, was full of dream-inducing books. There were history tomes, collections of indigenous myths, worthy ecology-focused essays, Darwin's Voyage of the Beagle and, of course, Bruce Chatwin's seminal travelogue In Patagonia</p> <p>Back in the 1970s, Chatwin and Paul Theroux had found common ground - and literary success - in a writerly notion of Patagonia. Speaking for both of them, Chatwin once remarked: 'A literary reference or connection is likely to excite us as much as a rare animal or plant.' He idealised Patagonia as a place where you could hide away in 'the final capes of exile' - an escape from modernity and a refuge from war (in the late 1970s many writers were obsessed with the idea of living in lands beyond the threat of nuclear conflict).</p> <p>There were also gorgeous coffee-table books full of sweeping landscapes and handsome, well-scrubbed gauchos, the iconic cowboys of Argentina. With a glass of Patagonian white in my hand and a fire crackling in the hearth, I could have stayed up all night turning the pages.</p> <p>You could get lazy, and fat, in Patagonia. Fortunately, the other side of the experience is anything but sedentary. The next day Pablo took me on a tough trek up through rugged foothills covered in beech forest to get to what he promised would be a photogenic view of the higher mountains. As well as El Chalt\u00e9n - at 3,405m indisputably the mother mountain - there are several other peaks and pinnacles clustered around the same granite massif. Some take the names of local heroes, including the Poincenot Needle, dedicated to an Alpinist who died in a fall from the mountain, and the Saint-Ex\u00fapery Needle, for the famed aviator who introduced a flying postal service to Patagonia in the late 1920s. Moreno actually re-baptised Chalt\u00e9n as Fitz Roy in 1877 but for many locals the name hasn't stuck - they prefer the Indian name; and, of course, Moreno has his own peak nearby.</p> <p>Sadly, as we went up the clouds came down and by the time we had reached a ridge high enough to get a photograph, a snowstorm blocked the view, whichever direction we looked in. We picnicked on venison sandwiches and apples, and began the trek down. A perfect close-up sighting of a magellanic woodpecker - with its vermilion head thrashing away on a tree-trunk - made up for the earlier white-out. </p> <p>In the evening we had oaky malbec wines from northern Patagonia and a rack of lamb - Patagonian lamb is like truffle on the bone - while looking out of the windows of Los Cerros at a full-scale blizzard. It seemed to have come from nowhere and I remembered the records of FitzRoy when sailing south and how williwaws - hurricanes that come blasting down mountainsides - would suddenly appear in the valleys of Tierra del Fuego and whip down the channels, blowing the surveying boats off course and even causing the Beagle, a 235-tonne brig-sloop, to teeter dangerously on the waves. </p> <p>The next day we travelled south, stopping again at La Leona for coffee and cake. The latter was filled with a local fruit, calafate (a sort of barberry), which tasted sharp and rather tart. Local guides in Patagonia can't resist repeating the myth about it and Pablo was no exception. </p> <p>'An ancient Tehuelche story explains that the calafate bush grew to feed a bird that had decided not to migrate one winter,' he said, between bites of cake and sips of hot tea. 'It was the bird's tasty reward for staying. They say all travellers that eat it will come back to Patagonia one day.' </p> <p>Then we were back on the Ruta 40, which connects El Chalt\u00e9n with our destination, El Calafate, and with the northern and southern extremes of Argentina.The Ruta 40 is the Route 66 of Argentina, loved for its potholes, meandering bends and its sheer length - 5,028km -from the high plains of northern Argentina to the Strait of Magellan. But what lies on each side of the black top - forget hard-shoulders - is what makes the Ruta 40 so special. </p> <p>It always surprises people when they are told that Patagonia is the world's third-biggest desert, after the Sahara and the Gobi. It doesn't look like traditional desert but the vast steppe is dry, barren and bare, in its way. Out of the car window, I could see the scrub of tough grasses, sturdy little bushes barely moving despite the incessant and forceful westerlies and not a single tree between me and the horizon. The Ruta 40 is a comfort zone in this bleak terrain, giving you a taste of the end of the world, but with the option of driving on to the next cosy town.</p> <p>Only a few animals are attuned to such an environment. We saw armadillos and skunks on the roadside, troops of lesser rhea - the South American ostrich - hurtling across the plain and, up above, condors wheeling and watching for roadkill. As we drew close to El Calafate I saw a guanaco standing proud on top of a small hill - another native, and far more beautiful than his northern cousins, the llama and vicu\u00f1a.</p> <p>I went trekking on the Perito Moreno glacier the following morning. It was as exhilarating as it sounds, but it was especially wonderful after days of rock and barren plain. My eyes soaked up the blue ice and turquoise lagoons that form in the shallow dips on top of the glacier, and, once I got used to the crampons, it felt safe and solid, notwithstanding the groans of ice shifting below.</p> <p>On our drive back to El Calafate, I asked Pablo to stop so I could photograph a handsome old gaucho gent riding through the fields, casually rounding up some merino sheep. It was an iconic view - a man in a beret on a horse with a dog, with the Moreno glacier and Andean peaks in the background - and made up for missing the mountainscape at El Chalt\u00e9n.</p> <p>Many of the estancias along the south side of Lago Roca have been given the boutique makeover and turned into comfortable hotels; Argentinians do rustic chic better than most people and I would opt for a country sojourn over an ordinary town hotel in El Calafate any day. But just behind us was a real working sheep ranch, La Anita. I knew something of the story about the ranch and asked Pablo to take me to the monument that commemorated the tragic events that had unfolded there.</p> <p>Obscured by high grass and generally unsignposted was a small plaque bearing the legend: 'If there is a history written by the winners, that means there is another history.' In 1921, the local government, acting on behalf of rich landowners (many of them British expats) had massacred between 1,500 and 3,000 ranch workers who had protested at the miserable quasi-feudal terms of their employment. Branded anarchists, they were rounded up and summarily executed by henchmen sent from Buenos Aires.</p> <p>Just west of La Anita is the ultra-posh Alta Vista hotel, owned by the same family that is alleged to have perpetrated the murderous campaign against the underpaid gauchos. In 1974, anti-establishment director H\u00e9ctor Olivera had made a movie about the rebellion, La Patagonia Rebelde, picking up the Silver Bear at the Berlin Film Festival the same year.</p> <p>Again, in the middle of the wilderness, history and art had intertwined. What a different kind of literary travel this is to the English version, which revolves around visiting writers' sterile houses or ruins where poems were penned. In Patagonia, as well as the extreme beauty of the landscape, there is still plenty of space to think, and reflect, and conjure up your own ideas. </p> <p>Perhaps Patagonia's intrinsic poetry touches everyone. I asked Pablo to give me his definition of the region, hinting that if it was any good I would use it as an epigraph. He thought for a moment and delivered his verdict: 'For visitors, Patagonia was first regarded as an obstacle, then it became a resource and it is now an escenario - a backdrop, scenery, a kind of theatre.'</p> <p>Not bad is it? Tour guides are often very bright, but this was an accurate as well as a clever resum\u00e9 of the Patagonia that I had travelled round and written about. Conquest, plundering and playing, that's what Pablo was referring to, and modern-day travellers do a bit of each, hopefully with the emphasis on the last - well, at least when they can drag themselves away from the library and the dining room.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Chris Moss is the author of Patagonia: A Cultural History, published by Signal Books (\u00a312.99).

You can catch a bus to take you along this stretch and that takes about another six hours. </p> <p>If you are just visiting Argentinian Patagonia, the most common route is to fly to El Calafate from Buenos Aires (around three hours). The Perito Moreno Glacier, in the southern part of Los Glaciares National Park, is the main draw in the region, a short drive from El Calafate. </p> <p>From El Calafate, there is another seven-hour bus journey to get to the village of El Chalt\u00e9n, the base for exploring the Monte Fitz Roy Massif at the northern end of the park, another highlight. </p> <p>It's not difficult to travel independently, booking your flights and tours once you arrive there, but accommodation in the parks is limited and tends to get booked up quickly in the popular summer season, from October to March. </p> <p>Alternatively, specialist operators such as Journey Latin America (0208 747 8315; <a href=\"http://www.journeylatinamerica.co.uk\">journeylatinamerica.co.uk</a>) will tailor-make an itinerary with options, including walking on glaciers with crampons and trekking. </p> <p>Although most people visit in the summer when it's considered warmer, glacial winds can make it feel very cold. In the winter months from July to August there's less wind and fewer tourists too, so it can be a good time to visit.</p> <h2>Essentials</h2> <p>Accommodation at Los Cerros del Chalt\u00e9n (<a href=\"http://www.loscerrosdelchalten.com\">loscerrosdelchalten.com</a>; 00 54 2962 493182) costs from \u00a3130 per person for a double room, with breakfast.

  "<p>On a languid summer evening, the pavements of Rua do Ros\u00e1rio are packed with people drinking cold beer and caipirinhas. Music throbs from bar to bar and outside the street's most expensive-looking house two armed guards stand solemnly looking on. From nowhere, a firework pops overhead. </p> <p>Soon the carousing is interrupted again when three men on horseback appear, incongruously, at the top of the street. One of them, all manly thighs and black Stetson, draws catcalls from the intoxicated crowds as he fights to keep his skittish horse under control. It's a battle between man and beast all the way downhill as the horse bucks and lurches but the rider wins, just - and then races back up for a victory lap. Welcome to a regular Saturday night in Piren\u00f3polis. </p> <p>With a name like something from a graphic novel and a claim to fame as home to more VW Beetles per capita than any other town in Brazil, you might think Piren\u00f3polis would be better known. Yet, in a country as big as this one it is easy for places to go undiscovered, or whole states in the case of Goi\u00e1s, where Piren\u00f3polis is located. Without the beaches of Bahia, or the showy wildlife of the Amazon, Goi\u00e1s doesn't often feature on the tourist circuit. It should, though. With its vast inland plains and big skies spreading east from Brasilia, the region is characterised by pretty, cobbled colonial towns, hot springs, forests, waterfalls and wild, scented cerrado (tropical savannah). All of which have played a part in drawing the state's other big signature feature: hippies.</p> <p>Although the region is home to such counter-culture hubs as the Vale do Amanhecer (Sunrise Valley), a religious community started by a clairvoyant truck driver, and the Casa de Dom In\u00e1cio de Loyola, where a self-styled 'psychic surgeon' calling himself John of God claims to heal cancer, Aids, blindness, asthma, drug addiction, alcohol abuse and 'spiritual desperation' with invisible operations, a less extreme alternative scene can be found around the town of Alto Paraiso, in the far north of the state. </p> <p>With its 40-odd mystical, philosophical and religious groups, locals like to call Alto Paraiso the Brazilian capital of the third millennium. Rumour also has it that latitude 14, which crosses Machu Picchu in Peru and zips through the town, is to blame for the high number of UFO sightings in the area. But travelling there by bus from Brasilia felt less like a mission to Mars than a journey to the centre of the earth. The 225km route carves a path through endless fields and red earth deep into the Brazilian interior, passing lonely farms, puddles the colour of sweet potato soup, and termite mounds as big as Stonehenge. That Alto Paraiso isn't your average hilltop hangout quickly became clear when I got off the bus to be met by a man in dreadlocks playing a flute. </p> <p>To his regret, though, I wasn't there to buy beads or bongs but to visit the nearby Parque Nacional da Chapada dos Veadeiros. Created in 1961, this 65,000 hectare park (only a small part of which is open to the public) was listed as a Unesco world heritage site in 2001, in the hope of protecting the unique cerrado ecosystem from encroaching cattle, soy, and now biofuel farming; the rate of habitat loss here is said to be even greater than that in Amazonia. </p> <p>What remains is an impressively rich biodiversity. Of the 10,000 plant species found here - including 25 different orchids, purple trumpet-bushes, copa trees, pepper trees, prickly ash, murity palms and baba\u00e7u palms - 44 per cent exist only in the cerrado. Though rarely spotted in the areas tourists are allowed into, the park also attracts some of Brazil's most unusual - and in some cases endangered - animals. Pampa and swamp deers, jaguars, wolves, rheas, armadillos, anteaters, capybaras, tapirs, toucans and vultures all survive here.</p> <p>The catch is that you can't enter Chapada dos Veadeiros without an accredited guide. So the next day I met Marcelo from Travessia Tourism and what appeared to be the only two other tourists in town - Yaz from Australia and Maggie from Switzerland - for the drive to the park.</p> <p>Access is via one of two trails - either 'canyons and rocks' or 'waterfalls' - and we opted for the waterfalls. Setting off for a five-hour hike past towering waterfalls, jagged canyons and natural swimming pools, it wasn't long before the scrubby vegetation opened out and we were confronted by a spectacular view across a vast, ancient plateau.</p> <p>From here, we picked our way down into a lush valley, criss-crossing a stream over natural stepping-stones. From feathery grasses to colour-splattered bushes, flowers that looked like exotic sweet peas, bright lichen-mottled driftwood and the region's signature chuveirinho, or 'shower flower' (imagine a football-sized dandelion), the plants were so beautifully bizarre that it was like walking through a children's storybook. </p> <p>Eventually we came out at the largest waterfall, a 120m-high cascade that thundered so hard into the bottom of the adjacent canyon that it seemed to be falling in slow motion. Just as mesmerising was the multi-coloured quartz crystal in the park's rocky ground. Once exported widely, it is now left to provide a glimmering carpet. 'Look at this,' said Yaz, crouching down to stroke the ground as we came to a particularly sparkly spot. 'This is paradise, man.'</p> <p>He didn't feel quite as enthralled after lunch when, having nonchalantly stripped and dived into the nearest pool, Marcelo suddenly shouted across to him that he should get out of the water unless he wanted an athletic-sounding organism to swim up his penis. </p> <p>I thought back to Yaz a few days later when I headed back south to Piren\u00f3polis and went for a swim at Cachoeiras Bonsucesso, a series of waterfalls just outside town. Judging by the number of people taking a dip, I don't think there could have been any underwater nasties there, though the family crowds might not have appreciated his casual approach to swimwear.</p> <p>Near the falls is Fazenda Vagafogo, a farm surrounded by rolling green meadows and grazing horses that look so English that if it weren't for the odd termite mound or palm tree you might think you were tramping through the grounds of a stately home. The forest trail that spools out from the back of the farm is more exotic. Full of giant jatob\u00e1 trees, overgrown lianas and the sound of monkeys, if you're lucky you may catch a glimpse of a morpho butterfly whose huge, electric-blue wings shimmer against the muddy background. </p> <p>The Vagafogo brunch is an institution among tourists from Brasilia, an extravagant array of local fruits, cheeses, breads, chutneys, jams and meats. I spent an hour working my way through mangaba juice, starfruit chutney and sanclish (a tasty mix of curd cheese, onions, oil and tomatoes). I seemed to be the only non-Brazilian visitor. </p> <p>But then Goi\u00e1s has always been off the map. I was told the history of the Kalungas, a group of 4,000 people who live around 100km from Alto Paraiso. Until the 1960s, when the construction of Brasilia started opening up this region, the Kalungas had lived hidden from the outside world ever since their ancestors had run away from their colonial slave owners hundreds of years earlier. Apparently they stayed undetected only because this part of Goi\u00e1s was so neglected.

  "<p>With the rise of low-cost airlines and cheap hotel booking websites, the package holiday, which seemed such a modern and glamorous concept when it started 40 years ago, has begun to appear outmoded. By scouring the internet, holiday-seekers have in recent years been able to put together their own flexible combination of flight and hotel, and it often works out cheaper.</p> <p>This will be scant consolation to the 10,000 people who booked their flights directly with XL Airways and are now stranded abroad. While travellers who had booked a package holiday with XL's tour operating division will be entitled to a full refund and repatriation, those who booked only a flight have been left high and dry. </p> <p>Tour operators have been lobbying the government for years to bring airlines under the umbrella of the Atol licensing system, which is operated by the Civil Aviation Authority. Currently, all travel companies selling flight-inclusive packages are obliged to pay into this financial protection scheme, with the exception of airlines. This two-tier system causes confusion, with many holidaymakers assuming their trips are financially protected when they are not. The fact that most of the big tour operators like First Choice and XL run their own airlines (often with the same name) only adds to the confusion.</p> <p>As the popularity of DIY holidays has soared, so the percentage of travellers protected by the Atol scheme has diminished. With increasing fuel prices and the ongoing credit crunch, travel industry experts predict there is worse to come. </p> <p>So how can we make sure we are covered in the event of our travel plans going belly up? Short of ditching foreign travel altogether and decamping to Cornwall, there are steps we can take.</p> <p>If you are booking a package (for example, flights and accommodation) check the tour operator has an Atol licence. This will guarantee that your money is refunded in the event of your travel company or airline going bust. If that should happen while you are abroad, then it is the responsibility of the travel company to get you home and to cover the cost of rebooking flights and accommodation.</p> <p>If you book your flights and/or accommodation separately, for example through an airline or hotel booking website, then you are not covered by Atol and should use your credit card to make the booking. Provided the payment is for \u00a3100 or more, you can claim a refund. However, this will not cover you for the additional cost of rebooking flights or alternative accommodation. Ordinary debit cards do not offer a refund in these circumstances. </p> <p>Alternatively, you can buy a travel insurance policy which covers airline insolvency. The majority of policies do not cover this so you should check the small print.</p> <p>These are uncertain times for the travel industry, but one thing looks increasingly certain. While the days of carefree surfing for cheap flights with airlines you have never heard of may be numbered, the package holiday will live to fight another day.</p>",
  "<p>Of all the high-profile business scalps claimed by the credit crunch, nothing has brought home the distress in the financial community to consumers like this week's collapse of travel firm XL Leisure Group.</p> <p>Images of stranded passengers, coupled with disappointed would-be holidaymakers sent home from the airport clutching leaflets explaining XL's demise, evoked the last major collapse in the sector: that of International Leisure Group in 1991, brought down by recession and the first Gulf War. British Airways chief executive Willie Walsh added to the gloom, warning that 30 airlines could go bust between now and Christmas, wiped out by the economic downturn and volatile crude oil prices.</p> <p>But is it really Armageddon for the big tour operators and their investors? Peter Long, the chief executive of German-listed giant TUI, which owns First Choice, says that despite XL's billing as the UK's third-largest 'tour operator', it was actually an airline that dabbled in holidays: 'TUI is a tour operator. We own our own aircraft [simply] to take passengers on holiday, so our transaction values are much higher. XL was a hybrid and these are the kind of businesses that are failing.'</p> <p>Fuel accounts for up to 50 per cent of an airline's cost base but just 10 per cent of that of a traditional tour operator, which makes its margin packaging up holidays. XL relied on selling air fares to other travel firms and individuals.</p> <p>'XL was not a major travel player in the league of TUI and Thomas Cook, although it was sizeable,' says Travel-zest chief executive Chris Mottershead, who ran Airtours in the Nineties and Thomson in the early part of this century. 'Inevitably headlines like this are harmful but I don't think XL's problems reflect the wider industry. From an industry point of view, its collapse is a good thing as it tightens up capacity.' In fact, TUI's and Thomas Cook's shares both rose on Friday.</p> <p>The demise of XL, which operated holidays under brands such as Freedom Flights and Medlife Hotels, means less choice and the spectre of higher prices. However, Long says price rises were already an inevitability. TUI's brochure prices are set to increase 6 per cent to compensate for the weaker pound and rising cost of fuel. 'The days of very cheap travel are over,' says Long. 'But we do not intend to put our brochure prices up beyond recovering costs.'</p> <p>XL was forced to call in the administrators on Friday, after refinancing talks over its near \u00a3150m debts with backers, including Icelandic bank Straumer, collapsed. Straumer claimed it tried to save the business by pumping \u00a311m into the company in recent months.</p> <p>The latest accounts for the company showed it made a pre-tax loss of \u00a37.1m on sales of \u00a3549m in the year to 31 October. It was estimated XL required an injection of \u00a370m to survive the winter. The timing of its collapse reflects the financial calendar of the industry: firms bank deposits early in the year but don't settle their bills with suppliers until now. The business will probably never recover: administrator Kroll has said it is unlikely to be able to trade it as a going concern.</p> <p>Most consumer-facing industries are suffering as people rein in their spending. Lastminute.com chief executive Ian McCaig said: 'Demand has fallen in the UK and Spain, less so in Germany, and the outlook will be difficult until the end of 2009. Those still travelling are visiting places where their money goes further. When the market gets tough, retailers have withdrawn in the past but I think you have got to step into it. You have to stand by your suppliers and make sure you are as efficient as possible.'</p> <p>XL's demise will mean cheap, late deals will be thin on the ground this autumn, making it harder for consumers to get away. The travel market is at a standstill and the big operators have already cut the number of holidays on offer to preserve margins.</p> <p>Industry experts predict more pain and despite two mega-deals last year - German outfit TUI merged with First Choice Holidays, while Thomas Cook got into bed with rival MyTravel - Long sees further consolidation on the horizon. 'It is the law of the jungle in the world of capitalism,' he says. 'Businesses fail and, as a result, healthy ones get stronger.'</p>",
  "<p>The Labour party has traditionally been frightened of the financial markets, often with good reason. Gordon Brown has been obsessively wary of the Conservative party, often with less reason. It was through fear of the financial markets that Brown handed control of official interest rates to the Bank of England. Oddly enough, the Attlee government nationalised the Bank in 1946 out of fearful memories of what the financial markets had done to Labour in 1929-31. It's a funny old world.</p> <p>Putting monetary policy in the hands of non-political technicians was deemed necessary so that New Labour's baggage train of revisionist policies would not be derailed by the financial highwaymen of the City of London or by the broader financial world. Well, here we are on the verge of autumn 2008, and Gordon Brown's government finds itself in deep trouble not least because, by trying to outflank the Conservatives from the right (the 10p tax fiasco, identity cards, plans for 42 days' detention without trial), it has alienated its core vote while achieving the seemingly impossible in making the Conservatives claim to be the more caring party. </p> <p>Depressed Labour supporters in general, and Brown in particular, could take heart from two refreshing contributions to the debate by those great foot soldiers of the moderate left, the Fabians. In an article in Renewal, Sunder Katwala, general-secretary of the Fabian Society, argues: 'Labour's mission is greater equality. It must again be the fairness party, or it is nothing.' </p> <p>In a world where memories are often short, Katwala reminds his fellow Labour party members that New Labour was not just the work of Blair and Brown: the ground had been prepared by Neil Kinnock, John Smith and others. Indeed, way back in the Nuffield General Election Study of 1992, David Butler and Dennis Kavanagh identified some of New Labour's characteristics - its emphasis on 'skills training, new ways of working, improved public services, greater rights for women and families, and protection of the environment' some two years before the Granita Deal between Blair and Brown. </p> <p>Katwala acknowledges that renewing Labour's claim to fairness will be difficult after the 10p tax episode. 'Nobody will stand against fairness, least of all David Cameron's shiny new Conservatism.' He adds: 'The disagreement between the parties is primarily about the role and responsibility of government... Cameron's claim to be the true 'progressive' is founded on his claim that Conservatives know that it is not the state's job to act on the important progressive causes of social inequality, climate change or international development ... Labour's argument must be the opposite: \"fairness doesn't happen by chance\".' </p> <p>Tim Horton, the Fabian research director, takes up the baton with a searching analysis of the Conservatives' plans for public spending. Looking beneath the sheep's clothing in which George Osborne's recent statements have been draped, Horton notes that 'sharing the proceeds of growth' means cutting tax and public spending at a time - the next 10 to 20 years - when demographic factors (a growing and ageing population) will mean that public spending will need to be increased merely to maintain standards which many people regard as barely adequate at the present. New Labour is in danger of allowing the debate to centre on managerial competence but there is a profound division between the parties on desirable levels of public spending.</p> <p>As Katwala notes, 'the credit crunch has shown how citizens look to government to provide stability and insure them against the worst risks ... voters should decide whether more free childcare and safer streets would be better for them than tax cuts.'</p> <p>Which brings us back to the financial markets. Perhaps the appropriate question at present is not how to share the proceeds of growth, but how to share the proceeds of recession. A healthy debate has opened up about the ethics of a financial and banking culture in which the participants think they are entitled to vast salaries and huge bonuses whether they are making or losing money for their clients. </p> <p>New Labour had an exaggerated respect for the financial markets - a respect that these days is not even shared by the governor of the Bank of England. The fallout from the credit crunch may yet prove that the Chancellor of the Exchequer was right to be so pessimistic in public. The understandable interest in the US presidential election may have distracted people from the hugely significant US government bail-out of the US financial institutions Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. The bailers-out had to be bailed out!</p> <p>The collapse of the modern banking model, one of whose central fallacies was the belief that by spreading risk you could eliminate it, has indeed produced the biggest financial crisis for many decades. This does not yet merit being categorised as the biggest economic crisis for 60 years, and the very move towards recession is itself easing 'stagflationary' fears and raising the prospect of cuts in interest rates at some stage. But the idea that, after what it has produced, the financial sector does not need better regulation is for the birds. As Hannes Androsch, former finance minister and vice-chancellor of Austria, says in the summer issue of Europe's World: 'Like technological innovation, financial regulation is concerned with cost reduction; in this case the cost of transferring funds from savers to investors ... But where financial innovation is designed to circumvent regulation, either prudential or taxation, we need to be much more circumspect.'</p>",
  "<p>One in six mothers has a favourite child - but would never admit to it, according to a survey by Netmums, one of the most popular parenting websites in the UK.</p> <p>More than 1,000 mothers responded to the survey, with 16 per cent admitting that they love one child more than the others. One third said that they love their children in exactly the same way, while just over half said they love their children differently - but equally.</p> <p>'I do have a favourite child: my second youngest and my last daughter,' admitted Polly, a mother of four. 'It's almost like a secret love affair. When she walks into a room with my other children, she stands out to me more than the rest. I would die for all my kids, but I have to admit I would fight more strongly and fiercely for her.'</p> <p>Polly said: 'It feels like I'm betraying my other wonderful children and the impact on them could be potentially devastating. But I strongly believe that most parents do have a favourite child but are reluctant to admit it. Most parents recoil in horror at the thought of admitting this, and spend a lot of time and worry suppressing their feelings. I have come to private terms with the fact that I am going to have to continue - like most other parents - to live in denial.'</p> <p>Jodie Hill, also a mother of four who lives in Newcastle upon Tyne, favours her daughter. </p> <p>'My mother-in-law and I have argued about it, but my feelings are too overpowering to deny. I can't deny that my daughter is my favourite,' she said. 'There are reasons for it. I had always wanted a girl but had three sons. Then I got pregnant by mistake and almost had a termination. </p> <p>'I thought I was hiding my preference, but after my mother-in-law stepped in and challenged me, I've tried to control my behaviour,' she said. 'I no longer spoil my daughter and not my sons, and I try to spend extra time with the boys alone, to get closer to them.'</p> <p>There is very little research into favouritism. This, said Christine Duff, a member of the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy and a Netmums online Parent Supporter, is a result of the level of taboo that the issue holds in society.</p> <p>'Sadly I hear this all the time,' she said. 'It is something which causes women intense shame and guilt. Mothers need to know that it is not uncommon to struggle to bond with one or more children and that it can be worked on.'</p> <p>Duff said that many women find it hardest to bond with their eldest child, a feeling which could stem from the difficulty of being a first-time mother.</p> <p>However, there are exceptions, she said, many of which have very little to do with the children themselves.</p> <p>'I have found that often those mothers who have told me that they love one child over another also very often report dissatisfaction with how their relationship with their partners has changed,' she said. 'It often seems to me to be about unrealistic expectations of life, love, motherhood and themselves, all combined with an overly harsh self-judgment.' </p> <p>Justine Roberts, the co-founder of Mumsnet, another parenting website, said that mothers feel so ashamed of having a favourite child that they are often unable to even address the issue in an anonymous online environment.</p> <p>'Parents are really concerned, and rightly so, of loving one child more than the other, but I'm sure it's really common,' she added. 'It's entirely natural, after all - some children are easier to love because they're more likeable, they cause less anxiety and they make your life easier. But feeling that way it doesn't have to mean you treat your children differently. </p> <p>'It's a shame there isn't more help and advice out there for parents in this situation, but it's understandable. People are very cautious for very good reasons. You can't exactly buy a book about this issue and leave it lying around the house.'</p> <p>However, according to Dr Martina Klett-Davies, who is a sociologist who specialises in families and sibling relationships, favouritism can have the counterintuitive impact of harming the preferred child while helping their siblings.</p> <p>'If there is a favourite child, they probably become too spoiled and find it difficult in later life,' she said. 'But the imbalance could prepare siblings for unfairness in later life when you leave the family circle by teaching them to be fighters.'</p> <h2>Please tell me it's not abnormal</h2> <p>It was the feeling that she was breaking the ultimate parenting taboo that caused Hazel Smith, of Liverpool, most distress when she realised she favoured the younger of her two sons. </p> <p>'I admit these feelings to my partner, but would feel too ashamed to talk about it with my friends. I tried speaking to the child health visitor, but she dismissed it as post-natal depression, which I know it is not.</p> <p>'Having a favourite is the worst emotion you can feel as a parent. There's no advice around for parents going through this. I have read child development books and watched television programmes about parenting, but they don't talk about it. That makes me feel even more abnormal.'</p>",
  "<p>To many Europeans, especially of a liberal bent, the emergence of Sarah Palin as one of the dominant forces in American politics is a cause for dismay.</p> <p>At first glance she seems to represent the triumph of the personal over the political. Her looks are remarked upon, her fashions critiqued. For supporters her status as a mother of five is touted as her greatest virtue. For others the Palin family is a source of sniping gossip. Her breezy, straight-talking style is hailed by admirers as a key to unlocking the vital support of the latest fad in polling demographics: Wal-Mart Moms. Others see it as a sign of a political ingenue possessing little in the way of sophistication beyond her background as a small town mayor.</p> <p>This is to overlook the substance of her beliefs. Palin represents an extreme form of conservatism. She is not just anti-abortion, she opposes abortion even in cases of rape or incest. And Palin supports the introduction of creationist ideas into the classroom, alongside evolution. She is sceptical of global warming, only recently accepting that human activities might play a role, flying in the face of vast bodies of scientific opinion - even the US government's own advisers. She is pro-drilling for oil in environmentally sensitive areas in a world that needs to wean itself away from fossil fuels. Her grasp of foreign policy is limited to a series of hawkish and naive soundbites on Russia, terrorism and Iran.</p> <p>America has had eight years of a government that has held similar views. The result has been to put ideological and emotional distance between it and large parts of Europe, Asia and Latin America. Apart from isolationist Republicans, this is bad news both for America and the rest of us. America needs a friendlier world to do economic and political business. The world needs an America more in tune with its natural friends and allies.</p> <p>The political beliefs exemplified by Palin and her fellow religious conservatives are not the answer, no matter how well presented by her considerable political skills.</p> <p>Change is the watchword of the American election. But McCain, in putting Palin on his ticket, is trying to pull off an audacious con trick. Palin does not represent change, but more of the same. And then some.</p>",
  "<p>There are two ways of reacting to the Royal Society's claim that its education director Michael Reiss was misrepresented in reports alleging he thought creationism should be taught in science classrooms. Either journalists got it wrong or Reiss - an ordained Church of England clergyman - did indeed suggest religious dogma be mixed with science teaching. I tend very much to the latter view.</p> <p>As Sir Harry Kroto, a society fellow, and a Nobel prize winner, pointed out in a letter to the Royal Society, Reiss was an accident waiting to happen: 'I warned the president ... that his was a dangerous appointment. I did not realise just how dangerous it would turn out to be.'</p> <p>Now the society has been caught out, though in the short term it may ride out the current controversy. In the wake of Reiss's remarks, most commentaries have focused, quite reasonably, on the issue of how science and religion should be taught at school. At the same time, the Royal Society has rushed to assure scientists that it still believes creationism has no place in school laboratories.</p> <p>There is a second, more important issue at stake, however. How should the Royal Society, the world's oldest and most prestigious scientific organisation, treat religion within the confines of its own headquarters?</p> <p>Science and religion do mix, though the combination is often volatile - the reaction often depending, intriguingly, on the discipline studied by a particular researcher, according to Sir Tim Hunt, winner of the 2001 Nobel prize for medicine. 'Cosmologists and physicists dwell on cosmic forces which - if altered only slightly - would prevent many chemical reactions, and life, from occurring. The sheer improbability of our universe makes them all a bit spiritual and soft on religion. By contrast, biologists see evolution constantly at work in their research and are more hard-nosed about God.'</p> <p>The idea is not without exceptions, of course. Hunt, a biologist, is scarcely hardline about Reiss's creationism call, for example. 'I am not worried about this one, though I am definitely anti-religious.'</p> <p>But if he is unworried about God getting a foot in the Royal Society's door, many other fellows find recent developments troubling. Scientists such as Kroto, Sir Richard Roberts (another UK Nobel winner), and Richard Dawkins look with horror upon the spread of faith schools; the growing influence of bodies such as the Templeton Foundation, a conservative US organisation which constantly seeks to establish links between science and religion; and the prospect of creationism being taught in Britain's science classrooms. They expect the Royal Society to take a tough stand on these issues.</p> <p>Many of their fears are based on their American experiences, it should be noted. Kroto and Richards now work there while Dawkins is a frequent visitor on the US lecture circuit. And what they see in America unnerves them: school science teachers who firmly believe the world and humanity are the 6,000-year-old handiwork of God and who cannot accept what DNA tells us about our close relationships with the animal world, what isotope research reveals about the deep antiquity of our planet, what astronomical studies tell us about the size and age of the universe; and what fossils reveal about our own species' multimillion-year lineage. The prospect of such ignorance spreading to Britain quite rightly appals them.</p> <p>'I don't know if it is too late to stop the slide in Britain but I think it is in the US where they [the religious right] have now almost complete control over politics, the judiciary, education, business, journalism and television,' says Kroto. 'And it will only take a presidential victory by McCain, followed by him having a heart attack weeks later, and Sarah Palin, a creationist supporter, will become head of the world's most powerful country.'</p> <p>It is the duty of scientists to fight such onslaughts and be examples of rationality in a darkening world, it is argued. Hence the anger at the Royal Society for failing to firmly nail its colours to its mast. The organisation has a motto: 'Nullius in verba' (roughly, 'Take nobody's word for it'). In other words, verify everything by experiment and think for yourself. Both are noble aspirations. It is therefore baffling how an ordained minister - a man committed to believing the word of God without question - could have been asked to play a senior role in the society. Equally, the society's acceptance of money from the Templeton Foundation raises further concerns.</p> <p>The Royal Society - which should set the fiercest of examples in its commitment to rationality - has shown worrying signs of spiritual sloppiness. (Its current president, Lord Rees, is a cosmologist who attends church 'as an unbelieving Anglican', it should be noted.) Those of a religious persuasion might welcome this softening. I would sound a note of caution, however. Britain is still a broadly secular society which guarantees freedoms not just to atheists but to all religions, no matter how few its adherents. If we follow the example of America then all are threatened by the rise of a powerful Christian right.</p> <p>We badly need our premier scientific society to stand firm and present a clear vision of how our planet, our species, and the cosmos came into existence. It needs to be unequivocal about the wonders of nature as revealed through rational, scientific investigation. As Douglas Adams put it: 'Isn't enough to see that a garden is beautiful without having to believe there are fairies at the bottom of it too?'</p>",
  "<p><strong>Jasmin Vardimon Company</strong> <br>Corn Exchange, Brighton</p> <p>This autumn Israeli choreographers are everywhere. Hofesh Shechter launches a UK tour on Tuesday, Emanuel Gat Dance opens at Sadler's Wells in London on Friday, and Ohad Naharin and the Batsheva Company arrive in London next month as part of Dance Umbrella. </p> <p>Jasmin Vardimon, whose new work, Yesterday, premiered in Brighton last week, was born in Israel in 1971. She decided that her future lay in performance when she was 14, and her dance-class was drafted to cover a Tel Aviv stage with pink carnations for a performance of Pina Bausch's Nelken. After working for several years with the Kibbutz Dance Company, Vardimon moved to Britain and in 1997 formed her own ensemble. Since then she has produced a series of dance-theatre pieces which turn an unsparing but ultimately compassionate eye on contemporary human behaviour. Her best-known piece is probably the darkly suggestive Lullaby (2004), which is set in a hospital and was inspired by her father's death from cancer.</p> <p>Yesterday takes the form of a 10-year retrospective, and unites elements of several works: long-term Vardimonistas will recognise reworked scenes from Justitia (2007), Park (2005), Lullaby and Ticklish (2001), among others. The piece opens with a female dancer, YunKrung Song, standing on the feet of a man who is lying on his back. She is holding a fishing rod with a camera attached, with which she films the audience. It's a typically space-disrupting image: cinematography plays a large part in Vardimon's work. In the following sequence Song walks towards a static camera. Her face is projected, hugely enlarged, on to the cyclorama. The camera then explores her body, following the path of a marker pen with which she maps it out. Later she draws a house and windows on her belly, and other performers appear at the magnified windows and doors behind her. She smears the image on her body and the stage fills with smoke. The house is on fire. Panic.</p> <p>Passages like these sail close to whimsy but Vardimon keeps a purposeful hand on the tiller. Sequences are launched as comedy, as when Luke Burrough lectures the audience on disease control and Mafalda Deville zooms around the stage as an out-of-control virus, and then suddenly turns violent as he assaults and crushes her. Combative relationships abound. Christine Gouzelis flirts with Tim Casson, whose romantic enthusiasm turns to terror when she begins to physically devour him, burying her head in his track-pants. A solo by Casson is violently interrupted by Burrough, who bursts on to the stage with a megaphone. 'I believe that a man should not dance in public,' he bellows, introducing a manic display of National Front-style flag-waving extracted from Park</p> <p>Vardimon has a clear political and feminist agenda but a deft theatrical touch softens the agitprop edges. Her dance-making skills have developed over the years and so, vitally, has her preparedness to cut her work back to essentials. Tableaux unfold, flare for a moment, and are washed away on a tide of rhythmic, low-trajectory choreography. A beautiful, Bausch-like section from Lullaby sees the dancers in a rocking sea of feathers. While synthesising Vardimon's past work, Yesterday is also a meditation on the subject of memory, and as such brings a certain poignancy to the piece's bare-knuckle challenge.</p>",
  "<p>Ask Paul Azinger what qualities he brings to the captaincy of the American Ryder Cup team and the answer zips back at you before there is time to place a question mark at the end of your sentence. 'Intensity and a sense of humour,' he says. And you want to laugh with him but you can't because he is not being funny, he is being deadly intense about the whole thing.</p> <p>Volley the same query to Nick Faldo and a more prosaic 'attention to detail' is slipped into the palm of your hand, the answer of a man who has looked into a mirror a lot as well but who has spent much of this mirror-gazing time wondering how exactly these nice, reflecting things are made and whether his left-shoulder should be dipped just a further eighth of an inch in the backswing. Faldo the loner alone with his image, Azinger grinning at himself and the outside world.</p> <p>What is beyond doubt is that Azinger has been hired by the Americans because it is possible in the half-light to imagine that here is a candidate for Captain Marvel's role. The good ol' US of A needs Ryder Cup rescuing and after a series of half-assed captaincy efforts - a run that reached a particularly low low-point under Hal Sutton's 'god, we're good' leadership when he took the best two players in the world, Phil Mickelson and Tiger Woods, added them together and immediately divided by four - Azinger is desperately riding to the rescue.</p> <p>Or is he just desperate? Over the course of the next seven days in Kentucky we shall find out. Above all else Azinger will discover just how intense he is and just how deep and embracing his sense of humour really is. If he does not win then one suspects he will fail to see the joke, but then a lot of people find it hard to laugh at themselves. On the other hand a lot of people have found Azinger rather disappointingly unfunny this year.</p> <p>And yet it all started so well when the humour won over the intensity six months ago and he described the European captain as a man who used to be 'a prick'. This candour surprised a lot of people and not just because the American employed the past tense when he spoke to a British journalist, who could not believe his luck even as he wrote down the quote.</p> <p>The subsequent hoopla meant that Azinger took all of his balls home and since then he has treated the British media with all the embracing charm of a rabbit that finds itself seated next to a particularly nasty snake. This may indeed be a wise move by a man who clearly cannot trust himself to properly engage gear before opening his mouth. The downside for him is that it has encouraged a picture to emerge of a man under siege and a captain who maybe feels the pressure too swiftly and too obviously. 'Don't tell him your name, Pike!' But then the Paul Azinger I know always was going to bring passion and emotion and gut instinct to the table way ahead of the other stuff.</p> <p>Born in Massachusetts 48 years ago, Azinger grew up not sure about what he wanted to be, though probably it would be something to do with the boats that floated his dad's business. Scraping barnacles and general cleaning duties filled many a long teenage hour. It was, he admits, the first and last proper job he ever knew. By the time he got to college he was into golf, but he was regarded as average and encouraged to think of something else when it came to earning a living.</p> <p>Obstinate as well as ambitious, he worked hard, ignored the critics and turned himself into a player good enough to bounce on and then off the US circuit until finally, in the mid-1980s, he found a way to play the game that brought consistency and regular money. He was no longer average: he was good but he would never be great.</p> <p>He had his chance at greatness when he should have won The Open at Muirfield in 1987 but was ground down by his playing partner's silent refusal to go away during a sullen final day in Scotland. Azinger did not win his first major, Faldo did. No wonder the American thought the Englishman used to be a prick. Faldo can console himself with the thought that it is better than being a patsy.</p> <p>Azinger says he had never heard of the man who was to turn out to be his lifelong opponent until that weekend. This is surprising given that Faldo had come close to winning the Masters and been one of Europe's leading players for almost a decade by 1987. Selective memory, or is Azinger slipping in the knife again? Whatever, he says the two of them are friends, that their friendship was forged in the commentary box they shared as analysts for ABC. The friendship may have suffered a bit when ABC failed to renew its golf contract and Faldo went on to pick up the big bucks with CBS and the Golf Channel while Azinger wearily had to get his clubs out of the back of the garage. Azinger v Faldo again. Faldo wins. Again.</p> <p>If these chaps are friends then the American must have some interesting enemies. Azinger elaborated on this point during an interview with an American magazine. 'He [Faldo] doesn't talk much, as you know, but neither did I. When I play, I'm not looking for conversation. The locker room is different. Now, a huge irony. Ironies. We wind up in the TV booth together, we're doing Citibank commercials together and we're opposing Ryder Cup captains. Interesting dynamic. And we're friends.</p> <p>'There's the old Faldo and the new Faldo. He never said anything when he was playing, and I totally understand. He was possessed, and his personality was that of having to be in control of everything. Very bright, really thorough. He approached every tournament like a math problem. He was an introvert who needed to be that way to be successful. I would watch him practise, or we'd play a practice round, and I'd think to myself, \"I should be doing what he's doing.\" But that just wasn't me.</p> <p>'I can see where some people want a little of that controversy, but the Ryder Cup is way bigger than Nick and Paul. It's not about whether we go to dinner, which we have. To pit Nick against me in some kind of war and get the players sucked into that would be unfair to them and the event.'</p> <p>Makes sense but it is still a 'war' that Azinger will do well to avoid when the heat turns up now and 500 journalists make their way to Kentucky with several days of column filling to do before everyone can heave a sigh of relief and tune into the actual golf come Friday. The battle, Azinger has yet to work out, is not so much between him and Faldo but between him and the media. No recent American skipper has tried so hard to antagonise reporters more than him. This, until the whistle goes, is not the sub-plot to this Ryder Cup, it is the plot. Hunting season opens tomorrow. Watch someone else's space.</p> <p>Meanwhile he makes all the usual noises. The American team - weakest, on paper at least, of my lifetime - looks good to him. Not, however, good enough for him not to clutch at a big straw and publicly anoint the Europeans favourites to retain a trophy they have yet to lose this century.</p> <p>Logical of course but by reducing the home fans' expectations he hopes to relieve the pressure that will come when those Kentucky boys tool up on the beer and hit the course demanding a home victory. The 2008 American mission statement is 'Change' and the Ryder Cup is a tiny part of this big national mix.</p> <p>When Azinger agreed to take on the captaincy he first insisted that everything be done his way. He has changed a lot. Four picks instead of two, foursomes instead of fourballs come Friday morning. Tiger Woods he has lost, Muhammad Ali he has gained, the great man scheduled to speak to the American team following a visit to the Louisville museum erected by his native city in his honour. Who knows, it may work. Europe could have upstaged this sort of thing if Darren Clarke had been available to wander in to ask if anyone had a light for his cigar, but Ian Poulter asking if they think his bum looks big in his team trousers just won't.</p> <p>The six rookies on the American side will be starry-eyed at all this stuff but the big question is how glassy-eyed they will become when play begins and it is a big ask just to push a tee-peg into the ground. Azinger, who selected three rookies among his four captain's picks, is sanguine. 'I've said this all along, that to me experience is important but it is also overrated. I mean anyone who has played Ryder Cup in the last six matches has experienced getting their ass beat. Hal Sutton said, \"It took us a generation to get into this mess and it will take a generation to get us out of it.\"</p> <p>'We are missing Tiger, arguably the greatest player ever, and that's a big blow to us. But there's a bunch of workmanlike personalities on this team. I think their personalities all seem to blend and mesh nicely together. All my teams [he played in three Ryder Cups] were kind of workmanlike teams and we had some success.'</p> <p>He would have played more Ryder Cups, too, had it not been for the cancer that was found in his shoulder in 1993. He won the USPGA Championship that year and held off a crucial scan while he played in the Ryder Cup at The Belfry. He played Faldo in the final day singles, the penultimate pairing. The big match was over before their private battle had been sorted, America winning easily enough, but Azinger and Faldo played on. Azinger was one down when they came to the last but he holed a bunker shot to halve with his great rival and celebrated as though he had just won the more important duel.</p> <p>For him, he had. When he eventually watched a tape of his singles and relived his last-green moment he is said to have punched the air again and yelped: 'Look at that, I had cancer at the time and Faldo still couldn't beat me.' Not exactly straight out of a Captain Marvel script but not bad either.</p> <p>The Americans may well crave a Ryder Cup superhero, but until one comes along Paul Azinger just may do a decent impersonation. Then again...</p>",
  "<p>Arsene Wenger has called on football's governing bodies to strengthen their enforcement of transfer regulations in response to the growing influx of foreign money in the English game. The Arsenal manager warns that Manchester City's cavalier attitude to recruitment, purchasing Robinho for a British record \u00a332.5m and brandishing their intention to add Cristiano Ronaldo, Cesc F\u00e1bregas and Fernando Torres to their squad, could endanger the Premier League if left unchecked.</p> <p>His words come at the end of a week in which the Football Association's chairman called for stricter controls on the ownership of English clubs. In a barely veiled critique of City's new Arabian owners, Lord Triesman said: 'The distinction is between those who invest and respect the values of clubs, and those who are just shopping. It is hard to believe that an owner who thinks it is all right to buy a \"world first XI\" has grasped this fundamental point.'</p> <p>The superstar wish list that Dr Sulaiman Al-Fahim announced upon initiating City's takeover antagonised England's top clubs and could be regarded as an illegal approach to the players mentioned. A persistent critic of the 'financial doping' that allowed Chelsea to illicitly entice Ashley Cole across the capital, Wenger argues that the potentially still greater wealth of City should be carefully regulated.</p> <p>'The more money there is in the game, the more important it becomes to respect the rules,' Wenger said. 'More money means that people are very demanding with other people. They think they have the right to do things as they see fit. In sport, until now, the rules were quite well respected. I cannot say that every transfer was respected to the letter of the law, but usually there was a respect among clubs and the statements you made.</p> <p>'The beauty of sport is to respect the rules and to win. People who do not should not be allowed to win.'</p> <p>Wenger's concerns for the integrity of the rulebook also extends to clubs who use the regulations as negotiating tactics to increase transfer values. Asked about the manner in which Tottenham withdrew a complaint to the Premier League over Manchester United's pursuit of Dimitar Berbatov once a club-record fee had been agreed, he said: 'It looks to me that these complaints are used as a trick for negotiations and to get better prices rather than because there is a genuine complaint. You should get the message out that respecting the rules is important. You cannot have rules and then only respect them when it's in your interests.'</p> <p>Part of Wenger's concerns come from the additional competition City offer for a Champions League place, which the Frenchman recognises is 'in jeopardy' while arguing that his youth-centred squad remains capable of lifting a major title. 'They sell the story to our fans that because we don't buy players for \u00a3135m, we cannot win,' he said. 'We have to be strong and say that yes, we can win.'</p> <p>Wenger also warned that any billionaire contemplating a takeover of Arsenal should be aware that he would not tolerate players being bought outside his personal direction. City's buyers say they contemplated bidding for Arsenal, a company in which rival Russian and US investors have been developing significant stakes in recent years.</p> <p>'What is very important for me is that I decide who we buy and not somebody else,' Wenger said. 'We need money - if we want to keep good players we can't keep them at lower wages than that of five or six other clubs - but if someone came in and started picking my players, I would feel very bad. These people have to understand that you can have 20 trillionaires in the Premier League and one will finish bottom.'</p> <p>Al-Fahim, meanwhile, has reiterated City's intention to pursue Ronaldo. In an interview with Portuguese paper Diario de Noticias, the outspoken businessman said: 'Ronaldo is the best in the world - and City want the best. Maybe City is not that desirable a club at this moment, but this is going to change. If the coach wants Ronaldo we will do everything we can.'</p> <p>Such grandiose statements should be less common in future after City's new owners, the Abu Dhabi United Group, were advised to take a less abrasive approach to presenting themselves. Al...#8209;Fahim is to be sidelined as due diligence on the takeover is completed next week.</p> <p>A landmark weekend in the campaign to bring back football terraces is likely to receive a further boost today when MPs vote on a motion in favour of standing areas, writes Alistair Grant</p> <p>Yesterday, an estimated 50,000 supporters from 10 clubs including Manchester United, Newcastle and Portsmouth joined Eurostand 08 rallies demanding talks on standing areas.</p> <p>Today, the Lib Dems' annual conference in Bournemouth will vote on standing at football, with shadow Culture Secretary Don Foster expected to back a 'yes' vote.</p> <p>Alessandro Del Piero has hinted he might move to an English Premier League club when his contract with Juventus expires in 2010.</p> <p>'An experience in a foreign championship is tempting,' the 33-year-old told Sport Week magazine. 'In England... one lives better than in Italy, even in football. They have a more beautiful championship and, unlike us, they have managed to resolve their problems with the fans.'</p>",
  "<p>Gianfranco Zola produces a dark flash of honesty amid the panoply of smiles. 'I know this is a big risk,' West Ham's new manager says at his unveiling at Upton Park. 'I am putting myself on the line completely. All the goodness I've done is on the line.'</p> <p>Then, flanked by director Mike Lee and chief executive Scott Duxbury, the club's first foreign manager reverts to charming away the many concerns - his lack of experience, his seven-year love affair with Chelsea and his amiable disposition, which some feel is too soft to control self-absorbed multimillionaires. </p> <p>Many may wonder why Zola did not choose a less conspicuous managerial debut than taking on a club whose turbulent times worsened with Friday's announcement that XL Leisure Group, the team's shirt sponsors, had gone into administration. At a smaller club his limited managerial experience - as an assistant to Pierluigi Casiraghi with Italy's not particularly successful under-21s - would not have mattered so much. </p> <p>But Zola says he has his eyes wide open. 'The bigger the job the more responsibility and attention you get, so every mistake is going to be in the spotlight, but I'm not afraid of making mistakes. I became a better footballer by missing penalties and crying after that. It's all part of the process of becoming better. I like a challenge, it's something that gives me a spark.'</p> <p>He says the opportunity arrived 'out of the blue'. Earlier this year, when the press buzzed with rumours of a potential link-up with former team-mate and friend Dennis Wise at Newcastle, Zola had played down the likelihood of a move to England anytime soon. 'Right now, I'm still learning how to coach,' he said, 'although one day, yes, I would certainly like to have a go. I would prefer to manage in England more than in Italy.' </p> <p>He now feels ready to test himself, bringing with him a philosophy that many feared had been lost to our national game. 'When we play a football match we are not going to war, we are entertainers,' he says. 'We are trying to make the game enjoyable for the people who come to watch. We have to inspire them, give them joy. I keep this principle. I want to win, I don't like to go on the pitch and give the result to the opposition, but also I want to make it attractive.'</p> <p>Football is about spirit and human values of respect and kindness, says Zola - a philosophy that may be at odds with the Premier League, with its super-rich club owners and boardroom wrangles, but which chimes even less harmoniously with what is happening in Italy.</p> <p>'Whatever you say, English football is so much better than Italian football,' says the former Napoli star. 'In the 1990s we were a model for everyone and now we are really going down. It's very sad. We are paying the price for having bad people involved in football. They really ruined something, they broke the spirit.</p> <p>'They didn't care about the football, they cared about themselves. When there's money involved you think about winning, no matter how you win. It's always the same story - when there's too much money, principles are put apart. If the money comes for the good of the game I welcome the money, I'm not stupid. But it has to be for the good of the game.'</p> <p>In England, too, football and money are now inseparable and West Ham are as good an example of that as any. Zola may well find that his high moral standards are challenged at a club where, in recent years, the culture on and off the pitch has seemingly defied many of his beliefs, from the Baby Bentley epidemic to the monotony of play under Alan Curbishley and the dodgy dealings associated with the transfers of Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano. </p> <p>Zola's ideas about a form of man management based on inspiring footballers to play beautiful football, rather than frightening them into discipline, has been called naive. It is, though, a theory not so far from Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's, a manager whom Zola greatly admires. </p> <p>'Trust me, to have authority or respect from players you don't have to shout all the time as long as you prove that what you're doing is for the goodness of the team. I'm sure they'll understand you and respect you. If it is going to be necessary for me to become a little bit nasty then I will become nasty, it's not a problem for me.' Zola says he is prepared to manage young millionaires, but wants to adopt a more holistic approach. </p> <p>'That's probably the best part of the job. I like to give young players the possibilities to come and develop. It has always been my dream to work with young players when I retire and help them become better.'</p> <p>He has witnessed first-hand what happens when young men lack guidance by observing Diego Maradona, his predecessor, friend and great mentor at Napoli. 'Since he was 18 Maradona had so many things around him and he couldn't handle it. The people around him didn't help, they were always trying to take away something from him, not give him support. They were always willing to make him happy, when sometimes they should have given him a bang in the head.'</p> <p>Zola sees a great responsibility in protecting his future charges from such a fate. 'It's not easy. When someone is 18 and they already have everything they need, it's a very, very difficult and dangerous situation. But that is why I say that the people around them have to be responsible and have to look first of all not to the player, but to the boy. They have to look after his education, his mind, his attitude, the same way they look after his skills. The whole package. It's not easy, but it should be done.'</p> <p>Helping him at West Ham is likely to be Steve Clarke, his former team-mate and current Chelsea assistant coach, who is believed to be unhappy under new manager Luiz Felipe Scolari. If Chelsea agree to the move, Clarke will provide much-needed hands-on coaching experience.</p> <p>There will be other hands at work behind the scenes, too, including technical director Gianluca Nani. He was appointed six months ago and his presence is thought to have been one of the factors that pushed Curbishley to resign after decisions were made about players behind his back. Zola is unlikely to encounter such divisions, as it was Nani who recommended his fellow countryman in the first place.</p> <p>There are many doubters, but if Zola is successful he could breathe new life into an old and jaded club.</p>",
  "<p>In the end, it was a reminder for the Premier League's newest billionaires not to get too far ahead of themselves. Manchester City's supporters will have enjoyed their first sight of Robinho and the swish of his right boot that brought him a debut goal. Yet, ultimately, Chelsea made it a bruising experience for all those fancy-dress 'Arabs' who had walked down Joe Mercer Way with tea-towels tied round their heads and something that looked suspiciously like Cherry Blossom smeared on their cheeks.</p> <p>For that, Chelsea have to take immense credit. They were a goal down after 13 minutes, when Robinho offered the first tantalising glimpse of his talent by floating a free-kick past Petr Cech, but their response was emphatic to the point of being brutal. Ricardo Carvalho equalised within two minutes and second-half goals from Frank Lampard and Nicolas Anelka confirmed their superiority, the only downside for Luiz Felipe Scolari being John Terry's red card 13 minutes from the end for an alleged professional foul on J\u00f4, City's other Brazilian recruit. It was harsh, to say the least, and television replays confirmed that Terry was not the last defender.</p> <p>Strangely for someone who is usually so outspoken, Scolari refused to talk about it, but Chelsea should have a watertight case to launch an appeal and prevent their captain missing next week's match against Manchester United.</p> <p>That apart, it was an evening of huge satisfaction for Chelsea, whose performance sent out a clear message that there is an established order of merit at the top of English football - and, for now at least, that City are still some way off it.</p> <p>Typical City, you could say. Yet it would be unfair to pick fault with these nouveau riche wannabes. Mark Hughes's team made a significant contribution to an absorbing game,and it would be wrong for anyone to presume that the optimism that has been swirling around Eastlands will evaporate on the back of one bad result.</p> <p>'I wouldn't say it's a reality check,' Hughes said. 'We know exactly where we are at this stage of our development. It's early days for us and we always knew Chelsea would be really difficult opponents.'</p> <p>Perhaps, in hindsight, it was just City's misfortune to come across Chelsea in their first game since the Abu Dhabi United Group moved into power. For the past fortnight it has been constantly rammed down Chelsea's throats that they are no longer the richest club on the planet and that City are on the verge of worldwide domination. This was their opportunity to respond and, once Robinho had scored, they did so in a manner that might have left the Brazilian pondering whether, money aside, he had joined the right club, after all. 'I'm happy for him that he scored,' Scolari said. 'But I'm even happier that we scored three.'</p> <p>Robinho, in fairness, seemed happy enough in his new surroundings and Hughes described himself as 'delighted' with his new signing. 'Robinho was excellent. He showed in glimpses what he can produce and he also has an excellent work ethic, which a lot of people don't realise. It was difficult because he has just come off a flight from Brazil and he has played a lot of football. But I felt it was important he was exposed to what the Premier League is about. He will be better for it.'</p> <p>You wonder sometimes whether, when he is running with the ball, his step-over routine slows him down. But we can quickly forgive him because, overall, it was a debut that demonstrates this is a genuine superstar. One little pirouette to spin away from Ashley Cole was particularly enjoyable and there was something beautifully choreographed about the way he announced his introduction to English football.</p> <p>It came from a free-kick, 20 yards from goal. In a central position, it was the kind of area that every dead-ball specialist cherishes and there was never any doubt about who would be given the responsibility of taking it. Cech probably knew what was coming too, but Robinho's shot flicked off Lampard in the wall and the deflection was decisive.</p> <p>At that stage it looked like being a difficult evening for Chelsea, but equalising so quickly made a huge difference. Had they allowed City to get up a head of steam, the attacking trio of Robinho, J\u00f4 and Stephen Ireland looked as if their elaborate, triangular patterns could inflict more damage. Instead, Chelsea won a corner, Lampard swung the ball towards the penalty spot and the entire defence were guilty of collective ball-watching. Terry connected with the ball first, sending his header goalwards only for the ball to come back off Joe Cole. The bounce fell fortuitously for Carvalho, who thumped a volley into the roof of the net.</p> <p>The remainder of the first half saw Chelsea emerge as the dominant side, with Florent Malouda striking the crossbar with one header, then sending another flashing wide. Hughes talked of his players 'losing their spark' whereas, after the interval, Chelsea produced some lovely, crisp, pass-and-move football. Lampard's goal was a case in point, with four players involved before the midfielder exchanged passes with Malouda, sidestepped Richard Dunne and fired a precise left-foot shot beyond Joe Hart.</p> <p>Sporadically, City still looked dangerous, with Shaun Wright-Phillips particularly impressive against his old club. But Pablo Zabaleta had a difficult debut at right-back and, as they looked for an equaliser, they left more space at the back. Chelsea, who brought on the fit-again Didier Drogba in the second half, were in control and the game was effectively ended as a contest in the 70th minute when Cole sent Anelka running clear and the former City striker clipped his shot past Hart.</p> <p>After that, there was a genuine threat it could become a rout, but Terry's sending-off changed the mood and Chelsea were happy to see out the final exchanges, content in the knowledge that there was nothing Robinho or anyone could do to stop them. </p> <p><strong>THE FANS' PLAYER RATINGS AND VERDICT</strong></p> <p><strong>Kevin Cummins, Observer reader</strong></p> <p>We're in transition and playing a team who should have won the Champions League, but we weren't humiliated. It was encouraging. J\u00f4 was off the pace at Sunderland, but today he was making lots of intelligent runs and winning everything in the air. Wright-Phillips did it all except score. The problem was the occasion overwhelmed everyone initially. It was like an end-of season party, after we'd won the league.

Robinho was always going to score the first goal, but Halsey gave him a helping hand, awarding the free-kick. He took it well, though. But you can't surround a guy like Robinho with some of City's average players. Even so, I think we gave them too much respect to begin with, and we looked a bit short of ideas up front in the first half. But we got into our stride once we'd equalised and there were times in the second half that were reminiscent of Mourinho's first season with us, when goals looked like coming from all angles.<br><strong><br>The fan's player ratings</strong> Cech 6; Bosingwa 8, Terry 7, Carvalho 9, A Cole 8; Mikel 7; J Cole 7 (Drogba 7), Lampard 7, Deco 8, Malouda 6 (Belletti 7); Anelka 7 (Alex 7)</p> <p><em><strong>To take part in the fans' verdict, email<br>fans@observer.co.uk</strong></em></p>",
  "<p>Nobody could blame him for savouring the moment. Rafael Ben\u00edtez, routinely tormented by Manchester United since he arrived at Anfield in 2004, finally felt the joy of a league win in this most particular of North-West fixtures. Come the final whistle, the Spaniard barely knew where to put himself, before ambling on to the pitch to shake as many hands as he could reach.</p> <p>Such a significant moment for him and for Liverpool, who had experienced enough punishment at the hands of United to have a major insecurity complex. When the visitors eased into the lead before the clock had struck three minutes, a familiar sense of unease swept around Anfield - with the exception of the predictably cocky visitors. It was eight Premier League matches and counting that Liverpool had not beaten United.</p> <p>That it did not become nine owed much to the home team's willingness to respond. They summoned enough positive energy to ensure that even Sir Alex Ferguson could have no complaints. The Manchester United manager admitted that his team were out-hassled and out-tackled, and notably Liverpool did that fairly enough to end the match without a single booking. To add to Liverpool's sense of satisfaction, this triumph came without much assistance from their two most influential players, neither of whom was fit enough to play a major part. Fernando Torres was a spectator, while Steven Gerrard came on only midway through the second half.</p> <p>And so Liverpool topped the lunchtime table, with a six-point advantage over the current champions. The feelgood factor that generates is not lost on the players. 'We've been off the pace for far too long and it gives us confidence to know we've just beaten the best side in Europe,' observed Jamie Carragher.</p> <p>Liverpool also possessed the most impressive debutant of the match, as Alberto Riera, their newly arrived \u00a38m winger, overshadowed Dimitar Berbatov.</p> <p>It had all looked so promising for United. It took just two-and-a-half minutes to re-exert the superiority they have become used to in this most hostile of arenas thanks to an instant connection between Carlos Tevez and Berbatov. The Argentine's pass released his new team-mate, who outmanoeuvred Carragher and rolled the ball back into a swathe of space soon to be filled by Tevez. He applied the finishing touch with a swaggering curl.</p> <p>For the first five minutes United's new No 9 looked every inch the \u00a330m-piece-of-the-jigsaw Berbatov. But for the remaining 85 minutes he regressed into the Tottenham-awayday, totally uninterested, hands-on-hips Berbatov.</p> <p>Through sheer determination, Liverpool found themselves a foothold. Javier Mascherano and Xabi Alonso wrestled control of midfield, Dirk Kuyt and Robbie Keane chased like demons, and it was a worry for United that after their opening salvo they were able to test Pepe Reina so infrequently. The great new attacking trident evidently needs time to bed in.</p> <p>Liverpool are entitled to feel they deserve a teeny bit of luck from this fixture, and they got plenty in the 27th minute: Alonso's speculative shot made contact with three United players en route to the net. Patrice Evra deflected the ball into no man's land between Edwin van der Sar and Wes Brown and when the keeper flapped the ball at the defender's knee the ball trickled over the line.</p> <p>Liverpool's improvement continued after the interval and a series of threatening crosses from the left required emergency defending by United. But try as Kuyt and Keane might, there was a conspicuous Torres-sized hole in Liverpool's attack. Without him, they still lack edge.</p> <p>Half-chances came and went. Van der Sar stooped to save from Yossi Benayoun. Keane, a few yards out, flashed a boot at the ball, but could not make contact. On came Gerrard, only for his first meaningful intervention to give Liverpool a scare, as he was dispossessed by Ryan Giggs, who challenged Reina with a dipping volley.</p> <p>Considering Rio Ferdinand looked after most of the buzzing movement from Kuyt and Keane without seeming to break out of second gear, it was frustrating for United that the goals they conceded were avoidable. Liverpool's moment of catharsis arrived when Mascherano drove down the right and showed sufficient persistence to draw Giggs and Nemanja Vidic towards the byline. The ball broke away from all of them and was pickpocketed by Kuyt, who tapped the ball back to Ryan Babel. Suddenly it was mayhem on the Kop. Liverpool exorcised the curse. All those barren matches, all that frustration, came pouring out as the Dutchman clipped the ball on the bounce high into the net.</p> <p>Ben\u00edtez's reaction was to look down at his watch and bite his nails. But he need not have worried as United lost their composure. They picked up two bookings in quick succession for cynical tackles. Nemanja Vidic's was compounded by a second yellow card and a red, for a needless barge on Xabi Alonso in stoppage time.</p> <p>United demonstrated last season that a sluggish start can count for nothing come May, but with other teams endeavouring to clamber towards the level they have set, they cannot bank on making up for lost ground every season. It is worth noting their next league match is at Chelsea.</p> <p><strong>THE FANS' PLAYER RATINGS AND VERDICT</strong></p> <p><strong>James Carroll, ShanklyGates.co.uk</strong></p> <p>When they scored I feared the worst and for 10-15 minutes it looked like we were going to take a beating. But we started to get a grip, and had the rub of the green with the equaliser, and then there was only one team going to win it. It's about time we got some luck against them. The team battled all over the park, with even Benayoun going in for 50-50s. Mascherano was immense - his run and persistence created the winner. Riera looked off the pace to begin with, but really came into it and gave us the width we've been crying out for. Keane had his best game in red yet. I didn't see the march beforehand, but I heard it was quite big - and we want the Americans out, the sooner the better.</p> <p><strong>The fan's player ratings</strong> Reina 8; Arbeloa 8, Skrtel 7, Carragher 8, Aur\u00e9lio 7; Benayoun 7 (Gerrard 7), Alonso 8, Mascherano 9 (Hyypia n/a), Riera 8 (Babel 7); Kuyt 8, Keane 8</p> <p><strong>Shaun O'Donnell, Observer reader</strong></p> <p>I had high hopes today - after all, we expect to come here and win - but we just lacked cohesion; it was a very poor, frustrating game. Apart from the goal and the good start, United didn't play well. We were shaky at the back and with Fergie's cavalier selection of three up front, we were light in midfield. Berbatov looked OK, but he needs games. And we'll bounce back - we lost the third game last season but went on to win a double.

  "<p>At last, we can now say with confidence who the best team in the world are. It is New Zealand. For the time being, at least. They might not be able to call themselves world champions (can they ever?), but once again they have won the Tri Nations, their fourth title in a row and their sixth in the past seven years, which means they are the best in the southern hemisphere. And without any credible challengers in the north the case must rest there, which hopefully makes them feel a bit better about themselves. Being the best rugby nation in the world means a lot to them down there.</p> <p>This was quite a way to end the argument, a breathless game that brandished all that is best about southern-hemisphere rugby and, dare we say it, all that is best about the experimental law variations. Cynics will no doubt point to the preponderance of free-kicks, and there were a lot of those. Jonathan Kaplan was constantly awarding them at the breakdown, which was generally dominated by the All Blacks and Rodney So'oialo in particular. So there were a lot of tap-and-goes, which detracted a little from the shape so beloved of the traditionalists. Thank God they were not all penalties, though, might be another way of looking at it. Who knows who would have won?</p> <p>As it is, we have ended up with the right winners, but in keeping with a Tri Nations that no one ever quite seized by the scruff of the neck, the All Blacks went about it the hard way. Despite looking reasonably comfortable with all that Australia could throw at them off the back of a dominant line-out in the first half and despite taking an early 7-0 lead in some style through a try by Mils Muliaina they contrived to go into the break 10-7 down.</p> <p>Matt Giteau, in danger of becoming Australia's only real threat, slotted one of just two attempted penalty shots at goal in the game and then orchestrated the try that the Wallabies snatched on the stroke of half-time. His kick pass, as these cross-kicks are increasingly being called, was fielded by Peter Hynes, who flicked the ball inside to the rampaging Adam Ashley-Cooper. It looked suddenly as if the All Blacks were going to blow it again.</p> <p>It looked even more like that a mere five minutes into the second half when James Horwill crashed over after a break by, you guessed it, Giteau. The side who had lost their previous match 53-8 were now 17-7 up and looking dangerously like winning the title. The glory of sport, some might have described it as; the utter insanity of these ridiculous laws might others.</p> <p>But it was over to the Wallabies to show that they are every bit as capable of choking as the All Blacks, or maybe it was over to the All Blacks to put an end to this madness. Either way, the result was emphatic. Three tries followed for New Zealand in a little less than 20 minutes.</p> <p>Tony Woodcock was a magnificent sight haring into the corner like a winger for his third try of the tournament, which brought New Zealand back to within three, before Piri Weepu was over after breaks by So'oialo and Sitiveni Sivivatu. The lead was New Zealand's again, and they went for the kill. Off a rare second-half line-out, Weepu was through and, from the next phase, Dan Carter, imperious as ever, waltzed through what was left of the defence.</p> <p>The game was all but up, but Australia would not lie down. A try two minutes from time gave them hope and the All Blacks had to be as hard in defence as they have been in their last few games to keep the Aussies out. One final turnover long after the clock had run down gave Weepu the chance to belt the ball into the stands with gratitude.</p> <p>It was a riveting climax to a tournament that has taken a while to get going (stretched in ungainly fashion across nine matches, it has had plenty of time to do it). No Mexican waves during this one, the atmosphere crackled throughout. At last, Australia were able to put up the sold-out signs some time in advance, although the bad news for those hoping to revive enthusiasm for rugby union in that country was that a lot of tickets were bought by New Zealand fans. They seemed to make at least as much noise as their hosts as the game built to its pitch.</p> <p>So, New Zealand rugby is still alive after all. Ousted from the World Cup in the quarter-final, stripped of their best players by the wealthy clubs of the northern hemisphere and then committing the cardinal sin of losing twice in a row, things were looking bleak for Graham Henry and his charges less than two months ago. But the wise old owl did not panic and now the All Blacks have that mantle so dear to them. They are the best in the world. All they have to do now is make it so at the end of a World Cup final.</p>",
  "<p>Georgios Samaras blamed the international break after Celtic raced into a commanding 4-0 lead, only to face a Motherwell fight back in the second. Samaras himself scored two to add to strikes from Shaun Maloney and Scott McDonald. But two goals in a two-minute spell after the break from John Sutton and David Clarkson gave some hope to the home side.</p> <p>\"The first 55 minutes, we played really good football, really great football,\" said Samaras. \"We created a lot of chances, we had a really good tempo in our passes. But after that, I think our team was a little bit tired. A lot of players had a game in the middle of the week with their national teams and we lost our focus. Motherwell scored twice and just after that we were in a panic.\"</p> <p>Celtic started the game with pace and purpose, with Samaras hailing the performance as the best he'd seen since arriving at the club. There was a zest about Celtic's start to the game, and in the fifth minute midfielder Scott Brown worked a one-two of sorts with Samaras on the right side and when his low cross sped across the Motherwell six-yard box leaving goalkeeper Graeme Smith stranded, Maloney was able to prod the ball into an empty net.</p> <p>Three minutes later, with the home defence still trying to compose themselves, Samaras took a pass from McDonald, brushed past flailing home defender Mark Reynolds with some ease, and slotted the ball past Smith from 12 yards.</p> <p>There was more misery for the Lanarkshire side when McDonald met a throw-in from Mark Wilson, spun and volleyed high past Smith from 16 yards.</p> <p>Motherwell appeared paralysed. Chris Porter had the ball in the Celtic net just before the half-hour mark following a corner but was ruled offside.</p> <p>Celtic were in complete control but Artur Boruc had to be quick off his line in the 33rd minute to deny Sutton after the former St Mirren striker had linked up well with Clarkson.</p> <p>In the 37th minute, after Brown was fouled by Paul Quinn at the edge of the Motherwell box, Maloney cracked the bar with the resultant free-kick.</p> <p>But the rampant champions were not to be denied a fourth before the break, and in the 41st minute Samaras finished off a seven-man move by racing on to McDonald's flick to again bury the ball past Smith.</p> <p>Celtic should have been five ahead three minutes after the restart when Brown set up Maloney but the former Aston Villa man tried to walk the ball into the net and was eventually thwarted.</p> <p>There looked no way back for Motherwell but Sutton pulled a goal back in the 55th minute after midfielder Keith Lasley had put Celtic defender Gary Caldwell under pressure in the box, the former St Mirren man driving past Boruc from 14 yards.</p> <p>Two minutes later the home side reduced the deficit further when Stephen Hughes sent Clarkson through and the Scotland striker held off Celtic captain Stephen McManus to toe-poke the ball under Boruc.</p> <p>The tide had turned, the Fir Park men were in the ascendancy and following a whipped-in cross from Hughes, Porter had a point-blank header saved by Boruc.</p> <p>Celtic had lost their impetus but with a two-goal lead, the points still seemed secure.</p> <p>In the 78th minute Boruc produced a brilliant reflex save from Clarkson's header - seconds before Porter failed to connect properly in front of goal, the ball skidding wide of the target.</p> <p>Motherwell, though, lost belief in the final minutes and Celtic ran out comfortable winners, deserving the three points for their first-half performance alone.</p> <p>Motherwell boss Mark McGhee admitted his side were taken apart in the first half.</p> <p>\"I thought Celtic were excellent. They outpowered us, they outplayed us, they outclassed us big time,\" McGhee said.</p> <p>\"I think it was a really good Celtic team in that first half that probably would've taken three or four goals against most teams in the SPL today.\"</p> <p>McGhee insisted he had no thoughts of a stunning comeback at half-time.</p> <p>\"No matter what happened in the second half, the game's lost,\" he said.</p> <p>\"What we're trying to do is put things right in the second half.</p> <p>\"We did that but you could say what part did Celtic play in that, in terms of taking their foot off the accelerator?\"</p> <p>McGhee pulled no punches in his assessment of his side's defending, singling out Mark Reynolds for particular criticism.</p> <p>\"We were poor individually,\" he said. \"It was nothing to do with systems. For the lad McDonald's goal, Mark Reynolds gets totally outmuscled - it was poor.</p> <p>\"I expect better of Mark Reynolds and he expects better of himself.\"</p> <p>But McGhee, who insisted the result will have no bearing on Thursday's Uefa Cup clash with Nancy, praised his side's second-half fightback, saying: \"I was pleased that they stayed as a team. I was pleased they didn't go disjointed.\"</p>",
  "<p>Liverpool completed their first league win over Manchester United at Anfield in seven years as Ryan Babel struck the winner 13 minutes from time to complete a pulsating comeback. </p> <p>When Carlos Tevez opened the scoring in the third minute it looked for all the world as though the champions would continue their impressive unbeaten league sequence against their fierce north-west rivals, but Wes Brown's first-half own goal and Babel's cameo performance gave Liverpool a long-awaited victory.</p> <p>There was little that Brown, who scored the opening goal when these sides last met in the Premier League, could do about Liverpool's 27th-minute leveller. Nevertheless it allowed the hosts, playing without two of their most influential players in captain Steven Gerrard and Fernando Torres, to settle into a match that had threatened to race away from them. Babel's winning strike, when it came, followed an uncharacteristic mistake by Ryan Giggs, but it represented an appropriate end to a match the home side deserved to win. United's misery, on the other hand, was compounded by the dismissal of Nemanja Vidic for a second bookable offence.</p> <p>Sir Alex Ferguson had wasted no time in awarding his new \u00a330.75m signing Dimitar Berbatov his debut, accommodating the Bulgarian striker alongside Carlos Tevez and Wayne Rooney an attacking 4-3-3 formation, and the Scotsman's ambition was immediately rewarded as Berbatov, who had already seen a snapshot blocked by the hand of Martin Skrtel, set up the opening goal. </p> <p>Berbatov, raced onto a clever first-time flick from Anderson, took on Jamie Carragher down the right and showed exemplary vision to cut the ball back from the byline to the unmarked Tevez, who planted a delicious first-time shot into the right-hand corner of the net before a stunned Kop.</p> <p>The nightmare start for Liverpool fans was exacerbated by the sight of Gerrard and Torres on the bench, their manager Rafa Ben\u00edtez having deemed them unworthy of risk, despite both recently-injured players having passed fitness tests on the eve of the match. However, with Javier Mascherano and man of the match Xavi Alonso excelling in midfield, Liverpool's leading lights were barely missed at all.</p> <p>Inevitably, the early goal made for an exciting opening 20 minutes and Dirk Kuyt twice came close to an equaliser. The Dutchman fired narrowly over from distance in the fifth minute and, soon afterwards, was kicking himself when his poorly-struck close-range attempt enabled Edwin Van der Sar to make amends for teeing him up in the first place by flapping at a corner. </p> <p>Van der Sar's reprieve was brief, however, as the former Netherlands goalkeeper handed the hosts a bizarre equaliser on 27 minutes. Perhaps United's three-man midfield also contributed to Alonso being afforded enough time to set his sights at goal and the Spain international let fly from 20 yards. The sting was taken out of the shot by Patrice Evra's deflection, but Van der Sar nonetheless contrived to palm the ball against the retreating Brown, who could only look on in dismay as the ball bobbled into the net.</p> <p>United should have been ahead again within a minute as they sliced through the Liverpool midfield at pace, finding Anderson in space on the left. The Brazilian midfielder picked out Tevez, who poked the ball just over the bar from little more than six yards. </p> <p>As the match wore on, though, Liverpool began to dominate possession, reassured by their fortunate respite and enjoying the extra space in midfield. A frustrated Tevez was booked for a lunge on \u00c1lvaro Arbeloa while an injury to Michael Carrick saw the England international replaced at half-time by Giggs. </p> <p>Although the build-up to the match had been dominated by Berbatov, it was Liverpool's less vaunted debutant Albert Riera, who looked the livelier of the two. The Spaniard began to find increasing room down the left flank and United had to be alert to the his teasing cross, bound for Kuyt lurking at the far post, shortly after the restart. </p> <p>Yossi Benayoun also enjoyed a productive match and was denied by Van der Sar on 53 minutes, when Alonso played him through with a deft lofted pass. The Israeli showed good control to bring the ball down but the rangy goalkeeper covered his near post well. The Reds were by now completely dominant, United seemingly struggling to calibrate their new system and reduced to a singular long shot from the ineffective Paul Scholes who was replaced midway through the second period. </p> <p>But for all their good approach play, the Reds could not find their cutting edge, Robbie Keane epitomising their plight by producing an air kick when all had to do to score was connect with Mascherano's low cross-shot. Ben\u00edtez decided to bring on Gerrard to remedy the situation but he almost cost his side a goal, when ceding possession to Giggs whose 25-yarder needed to be tipped over by Pepe Reina.</p> <p>Despite all his experience Giggs would be at fault for Liverpool's winner, while it was Liverpool's other substitute Ryan Babel who was to score it. Attempting vainly to shepherd the ball out for a goal-kick Giggs was dispossessed by Mascherano, Kuyt picked up the loose ball and picked out Babel who sidefooted calmly past a clutch of defenders.</p> <p>As United surged forwards in search of the equaliser they become evermore exposed at the back. Vidic and Nani were both was booked for fouls on Mascherano and Keane, Kuyt was denied by a reflex save by Van der Sar and then, with two minutes left, Vidic was shown a second yellow for leading with his arm on Alonso.</p>",
  "<p>Darren Kenny won his fourth gold medal of the Paralympic Games as Great Britain celebrated four successes in Beijing. Danielle Brown and John Stubbs also struck gold at the Olympic Green Archery Field while a glorious Games for Britain's cyclists continued on the road, with cyclist David Stone adding a second victory in as many days with another powerful performance.</p> <p>Kenny finished top of the podium on three occasions as Britain's cyclists won 12 out of 13 events entered at the Laoshan Velodrome earlier this week. The 38-year-old from Dorset, who has cerebral palsy, placed second in the men's individual time-trial CP3 on day six, but bounced back on day seven to go one better than he did in Athens in the men's road race.</p> <p>Kenny held off the challenge of time-trial gold medallist Javier Ochoa, a former Tour de France rider, to win in one hour 37 minutes 00.74 seconds, 1.74secs clear of the Spaniard. Britain's 37th gold of the Games and the 17th by a British cyclist, moved them to within one behind gold medal of hosts China.</p> <p>In the archery Brown, from Lothersdale, North Yorkshire, secured an emphatic 14-point victory over Japan's Chieko Kamiya in the final of the women's open individual compound. The 20-year-old world champion shot six maximums into the gold target to her opponent's one for Britain's first title of day seven. \"I just went out there shooting,\" said Brown. \"It is my first Paralympics and I really wanted to get the gold. I don't think it's sunk in yet but I'm really happy. I had one dodgy arrow but otherwise it was a good match.\"</p> <p>Stubbs's second archery gold medal came in the men's individual compound open with a narrow victory over Alberto Simonelli. The 43-year-old from Warrington, who had most of his right leg amputated following a road accident at the age of 24, hit the golden maximum area eight times to his Italian oppenent's six to record a 116-111 victory in his first Paralympics.</p> <p>Stone, meanwhile, rode to his second victory in two days with a powerful performance. The 27-year-old Leeds-based rider, who has cerebral palsy and uses a tricycle, crossed the line in 45 minutes 05.33 seconds, 3mins 27.52secs ahead of his nearest challenger to win the mixed individual road race CP1/CP2 title. Stone, who won the time-trial on day six, said: \"It has been a very successful couple of days, really wonderful. This is what I've been working towards for a long time. I feel fantastic, amazing.\"</p> <p>In the pool, Matt Walker won silver in the men's S7 50m butterfly as China took another gold through Tian Rong in a world record time of 30.37. The 30-year-old from Stockport, who has cerebral palsy, now has won a relay gold, two individual silvers and two bronze medals. </p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Preamble:</strong> Sky Sports reporter Geoff Shreeves has been on television saying that today's match is <em>not</em> about hype. \"This ... is ... a ... big ... game,\" he told SSN's small but beautifully formed presenter Alex Quinn, leaving a pause between each word, lest viewers should be in any doubt about just how big ... this ... game ... is.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p>It's certainly a big game for Dimitar Berbatov, the Bulgarian striker who'll be eager to impress on his debut for Manchester United. Liverpool's players will also be eager to please their manager, who has notched up a decidedly unimpressive seven defeats and one draw in eight encounters against Manchester United, during which he's seen his team score just once, a comical own goal by Manchester United defender John O'Shea.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>Liverpool:</strong> Reina, Arbeloa, Skrtel, Carragher, Aurelio,<br>Benayoun, Alonso, Mascherano, Riera, Kuyt, Keane. <br><strong>Subs:</strong> Cavalieri, Dossena, Hyypia, Gerrard, Torres, Babel, Ngog.</p> <p><strong>Man Utd:</strong> Van der Sar, Brown, Ferdinand, Vidic, Evra, Rooney, Scholes, Carrick, Anderson, Tevez, Berbatov.<br><strong>Subs:</strong> Kuszczak, Nani, Evans, Hargreaves, O'Shea, Fletcher, Giggs.</p> <p><strong>Referee:</strong> Howard Webb (S Yorkshire)</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>Team news we've whippped from the wires, which you'll probably have guessed from the line-ups anyway</strong></p> <p>Liverpool give new signing Albert Riera his debut in today's north-west derby against Manchester United - but Steven Gerrard and Fernando Torres are not risked any closer to the initial action than the bench.</p> <p>For the champions, Michael Carrick returns after an ankle problem which kept him out of the last Premier League outing at Portsmouth, and the Super Cup against Zenit St Petersburg in Monaco.</p> <p>All eyes are on new signing Dimitar Berbatov, also making his debut for his new club, while United's Darren Fletcher and John O'Shea are dropped to the bench.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>Eyes front for the first email of the day</strong></p> <p>\"Here we go again,\" writes Simon Hoyle. \"They say that repeating the same action over and over but expecting a different outcome is one symptom of insanity; I sit here ready to watch Liverpool take on Man U and expecting - or <br>rather hoping, really - that Liverpool will a) manage to score a bloody goal, and b) win. Am I actually mad?\" </p> <p>Probably not, Simon. (Well, you might be. For all I know you could have woken up this morning in Broadmoor, painted yourself green, put a pair of antlers on your head and danced naked around your cell.) But there's nothing mad about hoping that Liverpool score a goal or even win. The law of averages would suggest they have to beat United some time soon, doesn't it? <em>Doesn't it? </em></p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>Not long now:</strong> With Tevez, Berbatov and Rooney providing the pointy ends of a three-pronged 4-3-3 Manchester United formation, it has to be said that this looks a very attack-minded Manchester United line-up. I'm predicting more than three goals, with Liverpool to win or at least get a draw. Those of you who are familiar with my work will already be on your way to the bookies to back a Liverpool 0-1 Manchester United correct score.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>1 min:</strong> Liverpool line-up in their usual home strip of fire-engine red. Manchester United's players are wearing virginal white shirts, shorts and socks. It's like good versus evil ... the Red Devils kick off and immediately concede a throw-in.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>2 min:</strong> Having lined up wide on the right, Rooney brings the ball down the right flank and dinks it to Tevez, who drives a low cross in to the penalty area. Berbatov gets on the end of it and only a timely intervention from Alvaro Arbeloa prevents him from scoring with his first shot in anger for Manchester United.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Liverpool 0-1 Manchester United (Tevez 3)</strong> Tevez fires Manchester United into an early lead, having started and finished the move that led to the goal. From midfield, he picked out Dimitar Berbatov down in the Liverpool left-back area. The Bulgarian turned Javier Mascherano inside-out and returned the favour with a cross from the bye-line, allowing Tevez to rifle the ball past Reina in the Liverpool goal. I'm not sure who was supposed to be tracking his run, but whoever it is will be on the wrong end of a serious Rafa Benitez wigging at half time.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>8 min:</strong> It's all Manchester United at the moment and Liverpool's defence is looking very shaky. Having been stunned into silence by United's early goal, the denizens of the Kop appear to have found their voice again.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>10 min:</strong> Scholes and Evra combine well down the left, before teeing up Anderson, who sends in a cross. It's blocked at the near post and Liverpool clear their lines.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>11 min:</strong> Liverpool win a corner, even though the ball came off Alvaro Arbeloa before crossing the white line. It's swung in from the right and drops under the cross-bar. Van der Sar drops it and Kuyt attempts to smash the loose ball into the back of the net from five yards out, only to see his effort blocked by a part of Wes Brown's anatomy that may well have been his arm. Manchester United hack clear. This is great stuff.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>12 min:</strong> Liverpool have a raucous penalty appeal emphatically turned down by Howard Webb.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>14 min:</strong> Liverpool sweep forward, with Yossi Benayoun on the ball about 15 yards outside the Manchester United penalty area. He feeds Liverpool debutant Alberto Riera, who is promptly dispossessed by Wes Brown.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>15 min:</strong> Replays show that Dirk Kuyt's miss from five yards was not a Wes Brown handball - it was in fact an excellent save from Van der Sar, who despite being on the ground, managed to spread himself and keep the ball out. Of course if Kuyt hadn't made it quite so easy for him by smashing the ball downwards the goalkeeper would have had no chance.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>19 min:</strong> As Liverpool substitute Steven Gerrard warms up on the touchline, Manchester United go forward again. Berbatov is outnumbered on the right touchline and dispossessed by Alberto Riera.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>20 min:</strong> Howard Webb reaches into his pocket, pulls out his trusty yellow card and waves it in the direction of Carlos Tevez. The Argentinian's indiscretion? An ill-advised and poorly-timed lunge at Alvaro Arbeloa. He takes his punishment without complaint.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>23 min:</strong> Liverpool enjoy another decent share of the possession, but without troubling the Manchester United back four unduly. Apart from that corner where Van der Sar dropped the ball, they haven't given Messrs Brown, Ferdinand, Vidic and Evra too much to worry about at all so far.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Liverpool 1-1 Manchester United (Brown og)</strong> Good God, that was astonishingly inept. With Liverpool attempting to breach the United defence again, Xabi Alonso sent a speculative up-and-under into the Manchester United box. In no real danger, Edwin van der Sar flies off his line in a bid to slap the ball clear from the edge of the six-yard box, but his attempted clearance bounces off Wes Brown and rolls into the goal. That's a shocker.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>29 min:</strong> While I was stitching my sides back together and strapping on my whalebone corset, Carlos Tevez missed an excellent opportunity to put Manchester United back in front. I've said it before and I'll say it again, this is <em>an absolute belter</em> of a football match. Let's hope it continues in this vein.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>31 min:</strong> Free-kick to Manchester United, about 30 yards out, not too far right of centre. Anderson and Berbatov stand over it, before the Brazilian curls his effort into the wall.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>32 mins:</strong> Another Liverpool attack down the right flank. Yossi Benayoun tees up Robbie Keane, who pulls the trigger and kicks the kind of fresh-air shot from the edge of the penalty area that any golf club hacker would be embarrassed by.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>37 min:</strong> Manchester United win a corner, which Liverpool clear before launching a counter-attack that's broken up by a limping Michael Carrick. He doesn't look like he'll last much longer in this game.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>40 min:</strong> A marvellous tackle from Jamie Carragher puts a stop to the gallop of Dimitar Berbatov.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>42 min:</strong> From the edge of the penalty area, Michael Carrick tries to tee up Wayne Rooney when it looked like the shot was the better option. I suspect he was in too much pain to try a screamer from that far. His injury can also be attributed to Edwin van der Sar, who's having the afternoon of nightmares. The Man Utd goalkeeper threw the ball out to Carrick but put too much elbow on it, gave his team-mate far too much to do to win possession, and after stretching in a bid to beat Yosi Benayoun to the loose ball he came out of the crunching challenge an emphatic second best.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>45 min:</strong> Not long now until half-time. I'll be astonished if there aren't more goals in the second half, but I couldn't possibly hazard a guess as to which way they'll go.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>Half-time:</strong> Actually that's a bit melodramatic. I could easily hazard a guess, but I don't want to. What's that you say? Oh, go on then. Liverpool to win 3-2, with Robbie Keane breaking his duck for the club at least once.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>Half-time email:</strong> \"Give yourself a pat on the back, a GU sports journo who isn't using this as an attempt to take the piss out of us [LFC] for 90mins. Well done. You're obviously off the medication today,\" writes Mawal T (or T Mawal), whose email goes a long way towards explaining exactly why it is that some people like taking the piss out of paranoid Liverpool supporters. </p> <p>Speaking of football fans that people enjoy winding up, the word on the street is that Newcastle fans are set to demonstrate against the meltdown at their club by performing a giant conga around St James' Park this afternoon. A hokey cokey, if you will, a form of protest that sounds even more ridiculous if you attempt to say it in a Geordie accent. And to think they wonder why nobody takes them seriously.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>46 min:</strong> Manchester United substitution: Ryan Giggs on, Michael Carrick on. Keane and Alonso kick off for Liverpool, attacking the Kop.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>46 min:</strong> Carlos Tevez is frowning and shaking his head. Why? Because as he leaped in an attempt to get on the end of Ryan Giggs cross from the right, he gave Martin Skrtel a sly push in the small of the back and got caught by the referee, who gave Liverpool a free-kick. Tut-tut Carlito, naughty boy.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>48 min:</strong> Without having carved out any decent scoring opportunities, Liverpool are definitely the sprightlier of the two sides in the early stages of the second half. Robbie Keane tries to pick out Dirk Kuyt in the Manchester United penalty area, but his pass from the right-hand side is too high for the Dutchman and drifts behind the incoming Yossi Benayoun.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>51 mins:</strong> With Aurelio and Riera working well down the left-hand side for Liverpool, the latter attempts to send a cross into the Manchester United penalty area. He puts far too much weight on it and the ball threatens to knock a passing airplane out of the sky.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>53 min:</strong> A Paul Scholes snap-shot from about 30 yards fizzes narrowly wide of Pepe Reina's left-hand post.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>53 min:</strong> Another promising Liverpool attack comes to nowt when, with better options open either side of him, Dirk Kuyt shoots feebly from distance, making it easy for Edwin va der Sar.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>55 min:</strong> Good work from Yossi Benayoun, who does well to stay onside, ghost in behind Patrice Evra and win a corner off Edwin van der Sar. From the ensuing inswinger, the ball drops kindly for Robbie Keane, who attempts to slot the ball home, only to see his effort scuffed comically wide.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>57 min:</strong> \"Us Espanyol fans are still chuckling over the fact that a big cry-baby like Riera conned Liverpool into paying actually cold hard money for him!\" writes Tom in Barcelona. \"We miss him and his wayward crossing, lazy play and shocking attitude so much. Cue: Riera dribbling past 10 Manchester United players and banging in an absolute screamer.\"</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>59 min:</strong> Free-kick for Manchester United wide on the left, about halfway inside the Liverpool half. Ryan Giggs swings it towards the far corner of the six yard box, Pepe Reina comes for it, fails to catch cleanly and ends up chasing the ball towards the sideline, from where he hoofs it up the field.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>61 min:</strong> Martin Skrtel unleashes a surface-to-air screamer from 25 yards, but shoots straight at Van der Sar, who escapes with only his palms stung.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>62 min:</strong> If I was a betting man, which I am, and had money on Liverpool to get a result in this game, which I do, I'd be very satisfied at the moment. They're comfortably controlling midfield and vastly superior to Manchester United so far in this second half.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>64 min:</strong> Manchester United substitution: Scholes off, Owen Hargreaves on. John McCaughey thinks he might know why Newcastle's fans are going to hokey cokey their way around St James' Park this afternoon. \"Perhaps it's called having a sense of humour,\" he suggests. \"Try it sometime.\" It's an interesting theory, but if Newcastle supporters have a sense of humour, why would they want to protest about anything that's going on at their club?</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>67 min:</strong> Liverpool substitution: Yossi Benayoun, who's played very well today, off. Steven Gerrard on.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>68 min:</strong> From the left, Ryan Giggs drills a low cross into the Liverpool penalty area. It's a yard behind Rooney and Tevez. Moments later, Steven Gerrard gives the ball away to Ryan Giggs, who tries an audacious chip from distance. Pepe Reina performs heroics to prevent a magnificent effort from dropping under the crossbar.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>70 min:</strong> \"If I were a betting man, I'd bet on Liverpool controlling the entire second half, only to concede a faintly tragi-comical goal at the end. So, I'm feeling sickeningly comfortable right now,\" writes Gareth Barry. Actually scrap that, it's Gareth <em>Parry</em>.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>71 mins:</strong> Liverpool substitution: Alberto Riero off, Ryan Babel on. From the right flank, Dirk Kuyt sends a cross into the Manchester United penalty area, but his delivery is too high.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>73 min:</strong> Another cross into the Manchester United penalty area, this time from Javier Mascherano on the left-hand side of the sward. Patrice Evra clears with a meaty header.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>75 min:</strong> Alonso sends the ball wide to Dirk Kuyt doeep in the Manchester United left-back territory. He heads downwards, prompting Nemanja Vidic to hack clear.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Liverpool 2-1 Manchester United (Babel 76)</strong> Super-sub Ryan Babel smashes the ball into the roof of the Manchester United net from 15 yards after being teed up perfectly by Dirk Kuyt. Abject defending from Ryan Giggs on the byline, who could easily have prodded the ball out for a corner, allowed Javier Mascherano to scurry behind him and pull the ball back to Kuyt.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>78 min:</strong> Nemanja Vidic gets a yellow card (and looks relieved to escape a red one) when he fouls Keane a few yards outside the Manchester United penalty area when it looked as if the Irish striker had only the goalkeeper to beat.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>81 min:</strong> Manchester United are in total disarray and Liverpool are going all out for a third goal. They win a corner, from which nothing comes.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>83 min:</strong> Manchester United substitution that took place about five or 10 minutes ago: Nani on, Anderson off. For the record, Ryan Babel has just become the first Liverpool player to score against Manchester United since Harry Kewell did so in 1748.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>86 min:</strong> Liverpool substitution: Sami Hyypia on, Javier Mascherano off.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>88 min:</strong> Three minutes to go and Liverpool are about to knock Manchester United off their perch ... for the time being at least. United win a throw-in deep in Liverpool territory, but Alonso wins possession back and alleviates the pressure on the home side.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>90 min:</strong> With his arms up, Nemanja Vidic clatters Xabi Alonso in an aerial collision. Howard Webb blows his whistle, brandishes his yellow card and, after a short pause and possibly a reminder from one or two Liverpool players, remembers to brandish the red. </p> <p>Vidic is off for his second bookable offence. On the Manchester United bench, Sir Alex Ferguson has a face like thunder. It's on days like this that footballers earn their big money. If I was Giggs, Vidic, Scholes or Van der Sar, you couldn't pay me enough money to go into the Manchester United dressing room to face the hairdryer after this game. Quite how Wayne Rooney feels about all this is anyone's guess. He's been marooned out on the right touchline for the entire game and looks destined to stay there for the foreseeable future barring an injury to Berbatov.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>90 +3 min: </strong> With Dirk Kuyt and Robbie Keane both having missed good chances to increase Liverpool's lead, Manchester United win a corner, which is wasted. Shortly afterwards, Rooney drags a long-range effort wide of the post.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>90+4 min</strong> Peep! Peep! Peep! Howard Webb brings proceedings to a close with three shrill blasts of his whistle, prompting raucous celebrations from Liverpool's players and supporters. Make no mistake, this wasn't hype. This ... was ... a ... big ... game. They thoroughly deserved their win having been the vastly superior team throughout the second half.

  "<p>Billions of pounds currently spent on inspecting schools and testing pupils will be redirected to reward those schools teaching the most disadvantaged children in society under Liberal Democrat plans to be announce tomorrow. </p> <p>The party's existing plans for a \"pupil premium\", paid to schools for every child they educate from the poorest households, will be doubled to \u00a35bn by cutting back on central government spending, the party's education spokesman, David Laws, will tell the Lib Dem conference in Bournemouth tomorrow.</p> <p>The entire education system should be liberalised to give every state school the freedoms enjoyed by academies and private schools, he told the Guardian ahead of his conference speech. Heaping praise on the independent sector's traditional curricula, he argued that the national curriculum should be removed in state schools so teachers are free to decide how pupils are taught. </p> <p>\"We think that the national curriculum is suffocatingly detailed and prescriptive and the way that it integrates with the control that is exercised and the influence that is exercised by government in relation to what is taught in exams is stultifying.</p> <p>\"The consensus about that is very broad. It's not only the NUT and the left in education saying these things, the evidence that we get from the very poshest public schools in Britain is all confirming that they feel the education system we've got today both through the curriculum and examinations system is narrowing education unnecessarily and making it more difficult to inspire \u2026 the youngsters in the classroom.\" </p> <p>He will tell the conference that the pupil premium is the \"dynamite designed to explode the iron curtain of inequality\". There are currently several review groups within the party overhauling their education policies, the results of which will be announced in the party's spring conference. But the review will include an expansion of the pupil premium idea, he said. The money would come from cutting back on the central government education budget - understood to be about 18% of the \u00a350bn annual total.<br> He told the Guardian they were currently devising plans to make some of those savings by scaling back the work of Ofsted, the schools inspectorate, and scrapping Sats for 14-year olds, freeing up some of the \u00a3700m spent on testing every year. </p> <p>He said they would not dictate how schools spent the extra money they got through the pupil premium but they were strongly in favour of moves in some academies to extend the school day, shorten the summer holidays and open on Saturdays to give pupils more teaching time throughout the school year. </p> <p>Laws, who was educated at the fee-charging school St George's college in Weybridge, praised the independent sector saying: \"I think that the maintained system has a lot of learn from the private system, not based on the assumption that private schools get brilliant results, because it's not really surprising that they get results much better than the maintained sector given that the youngsters who enter those schools come from - generally speaking - advantaged backgrounds, with very supportive parents, and with a lot of characteristics which mean they are likely to do well.<br> \"The two things that we can really learn from the independent sector is that incessant government micro-management is not necessarily what creates a high performing and healthy education. I think the independent sector benefits from the additional distance it has from government and from state directives and dictates. Those principals of greater independence and freedom we want to see for all schools.\"</p> <p>He said they also had a lot to learn in terms of expenditure and that extra money into education should not be regarded as an \"extravagance\", particularly because people are so willing to pay thousands of pounds for a private education. </p> <p>\"It's really necessary to give those youngsters from deprived backgrounds a chance. If it's necessary for all those pupils with inherited advantage, how much more necessarily is it for that funding for youngsters with disadvantages,\" he said. </p> <p>Laws is due to make his speech at 10.15am tomorrow.</p>"
