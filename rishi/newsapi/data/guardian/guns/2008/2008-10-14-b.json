  "<p>The culture secretary, Andy Burnham, will tomorrow call for football to \"wholly reassess its relationship with money\", paving the way for the Football Association to lead a review of the challenges facing the game. Speaking at the Supporters Direct conference in Westminster, Burnham is expected to present a list of specific issues he believes must be addressed, which is certain to include the ownership of clubs and \"competitive balance\" - a concept which goes to the heart of the English game's dominance by the few clubs with the most money.</p> <p>Burnham kicked off the debate last month with his call for the FA to \"rise to the challenge\" and curb some of the game's excesses \"before something really precious is lost\". He believes the Premier League's booming television income should be more evenly shared throughout football, and that success should not be determined by billionaire owners funding clubs beyond those clubs' natural means.</p> <p>The FA chairman, David Triesman, has given a bold sign that he is up for that challenge. His speech to the Leaders in Football conference last week made headlines for his warning about \"high-risk levels\" of debt at Premier League clubs, but he went much further than that, promising a serious inquiry into the issues Burnham is urging the governing body to grasp.</p> <p>\"I think a review is inevitable now,\" Lord Triesman said. \"The FA and the professional game do not and cannot live as if in separate domains. We will work on the issues of club and country, the laws of the game, maintaining the integrity and competitive balance, behaviour, standards and respect, youth development and English-qualified players, agents, gambling, drug control and finance and ownership.\"</p> <p>The Premier League, which rejected Triesman's assertion that debts are dangerously high, will resist any moves to curb commercial freedoms and assert greater governing power by the FA.</p> <p>Triesman is not expected to be as forthright when he addresses Supporters Direct's conference tomorrow, but he will speak to the delegates from supporters' trusts in language they have longed to hear from the FA: that clubs are not just businesses, selling a commercial product. He prepared the ground last week when he asserted: \"Football clubs are not mere commodities.\"</p> <p>The audience for tomorrow's speeches is significant. Supporters Direct draws on the conviction that clubs are institutions of community belonging and, backed by the government, it advises fans how to form trusts and gain stakes in their clubs. The view that the current criticisms of top-level football are simply a reaction against \"foreign owners\" is wrong - the organisation had its genesis among fans opposed to stock-market flotations and perceived profiteering by English owners.</p> <p>Burnham himself makes no secret of his sympathy with the view that clubs would be truer to their real character if they were mutual organisations owned by supporters, along the lines of Barcelona. Supporters Direct was formed after the government-appointed Football Task Force on which Burnham, before he was an MP, worked as the administrator, and from 2000 to 2005 he was the organisation's chairman.</p> <p>After early days in which fans of many clubs formed trusts and there was talk of \"rolling back the plc\" at Manchester United, Supporters Direct has come to terms with mountainous reality. Clubs have long been companies, usually majority-owned by an individual, and the cost of buying them, even in the lower divisions in the teeth of financial crises, is beyond most trusts.</p> <p>The almost 120,000 fans in trusts at clubs throughout football have worked tirelessly, for no reward, but only 11 English clubs are owned by trusts - mostly in non-league football or, in the cases of Brentford, Exeter City, Notts County and Stockport County, in the lower divisions. Premier League clubs are out of reach, the preserve of the few richest people on earth.</p> <p>Dave Boyle, Supporters Direct's chief executive, maintains that supporter ownership is still a valid aspiration but he is realistic enough to argue for wider reform of the game. \"Clubs are in a race to spend the most,\" he says. \"They reach their limit, then spend money they haven't got or look for a buyer. We believe that is not sustainable.\"</p> <p>Triesman and Burnham's purpose goes beyond the issue that dominated fierce exchanges last week, the health or otherwise of the combined \u00a33bn debts at Premier League clubs. A detailed look at that would open up the underlying issues, because the nature of the debts is different at every club. Chelsea owe \u00a3578m to Roman Abramovich; he does not charge interest and is not demanding it back, but Chelsea's existence is reliant on the largesse of this owner. Manchester United owe the \u00a3666m cost of being taken over by the Glazer family, and the interest on that was \u00a381m last year. While United are hugely successful they can pay it, but they are vulnerable to rising interest rates and the difficulty of refinancing.</p> <p>A genuine review could investigate central questions such as: should English football welcome debt-laden buyouts like those of the Glazers at United and Tom Hicks and George Gillett at Liverpool? Is it right for the competition to be determined according to how much billionaires such as Abramovich or Sheikh Mansour at Manchester City are prepared to spend on players? What happens to clubs who cannot find buyers?</p> <p>Liverpool's midfielder Xabi Alonso pondered in this newspaper before the recent match against Manchester City whether football \"needs to be regulated, otherwise the clubs owned by millionaires will be several levels below\" those owned by billionaires.</p> <p>If Alonso, among many others, can ask that question, then Triesman will argue that it is his responsibility to conduct a grown-up look at where football is heading, in cooperation with the Premier and Football Leagues.</p> <p>Burnham's call for football to \"wholly reassess its relationship with money\" echoes that of Lord Justice Taylor, who 18 years ago, after the Hillsborough disaster, called for \"the fullest reassessment of policy for the game\". Yet that never happened. The clubs were forced by government legislation to make the grounds safe and were given public money to help with the rebuilding. Then, in anticipation of the first big-money TV deal in 1992, the First Division clubs persuaded a weak, myopic FA to support their plans to break away from sharing the money with the other three divisions of the Football League. The FA Premier League was launched, to immediate wealth and glittering success, but was dogged persistently by unease about inequalities, overcommercialisation, high ticket prices and, increasingly, the randomness of takeovers.</p> <p>Graham Kelly, the FA chief executive who backed the breakaway, has since accepted that the governing body missed a golden chance to manage the new era for the benefit of the whole game. \"We were guilty of a tremendous, collective, lack of vision,\" he said. Triesman, an FA chairman stunning football by speaking up, appears determined that the governing body will not be found similarly wanting on his watch.</p> <h2>The battle for balance</h2> <p>The most bitterly contested area for any FA review of football is likely to be not debt but \"competitive balance\". Premier League success is concentrated among the richest clubs, Manchester United and first Arsenal, then Chelsea. Finding a rich backer increasingly represents the only hope of competing, or even surviving, in the Premier League. A review would also consider the gap between the Premier League and the rest. </p> <p>Last week Richard Scudamore, the Premier League's chief executive, talked of the money the top clubs distribute to \"good causes\" - \u00a3131.5m a year currently. However, \u00a372m of that is paid to clubs relegated from the Premier League, leaving \u00a359.5m for the Football League generally, the Professional Footballers' Association and grassroots. That is 6% of the Premier League's \u00a3990m annual TV and sponsorship revenue. Before 1992, 50% of the TV money went to the other three divisions.</p>",
  "<p>Some of the world's largest financial institutions have either expired or been put into intensive care in recent weeks, but one bank in particular is bucking the trend. Europe's biggest social bank, Triodos, whose mission is to \"make money work for positive social, environmental and cultural change\", is thriving. Its most recent half-year results show a healthy growth in balance sheet and profits. \"Credit crunch bypasses Triodos\" was the bank's simple top line message to shareholders. </p> <p>In global terms, it is a minnow - at least, compared to the financial leviathans that are now looking so sickly. The group's total balance sheet was \u20ac2bn in June 2008. Its UK balance sheet stands at around \u00a3317m. But when credit is scarce, and voluntary sector finances are taking a pummelling, Triodos is preparing to step up its investment in charities and businesses with socially and environmentally sustainable goals.</p> <p>Charles Middleton, Triodos UK managing director, puts its success down to a \"sound\" model of banking: operating in the \"real\" economy (and avoiding complex financial instruments like derivatives); eschewing high levels of debt; taking a long-term view and resisting pressure for short-term profit maximisation. Until recently all this might have been regarded as unfashionable and staid. But as Middleton says, without a whiff of triumphalism, \"sustainable investment has worked\" for Triodos.</p> <p><strong>The alternative economy</strong></p> <p>The list of Triodos UK's investments - and it prides itself on its transparency in who it lends money to - reads like a who's who of the alternative economy: wind energy companies, organic farms, housing co-ops, arts projects, fair trade shops, social care charities, social businesses, even Buddhist centres. It financed the first containers of Caf\u00e9direct coffee to arrive in the UK in 1990, and 14 years later raised \u00a35m for the company through Britain's biggest ethical public share issue.</p> <p>Not so long ago its mission would have been dismissed as hippy idealism, or derided as a conscience-salving luxury affordable only for middle-class customers who did not need to chase the higher rates of financial return available on the high street. But its double bottom line approach - using depositors money to make a profit by investing in businesses which create a positive and sustainable social and environmental impact - is now looking like a model of how mainstream banking might adapt.</p> <p>There is no outward sign of the hippy or the radical in Middleton. Grey-suited, discreet and undemonstratively groomed, his background is firmly establishment. At 18, when he went off to train as an army officer, he was apolitical. His understanding of social justice came gradually, through his life experiences - on the streets of Belfast during the Troubles in Northern Ireland, and subsequently, as a banker with Barclays in India and Africa, volunteer work with homeless children in Mumbai, and with HIV-positive people in Botswana.</p> <p>Those experiences \"challenged me to think about how the world works and how we as individuals can influence it,\" he says. \"I have always been completely in awe of what individual people have been able to achieve. Moving to Triodos gave me the opportunity to take some of that experience and use it to work with inspirational people and businesses in the UK. They've shown me that there really is a different way to do business that is sustainable and fun.\"</p> <p>A \"different way to do business\" is a theme that emerges again and again through the interview. Triodos's strict approach to investment - its promotional literature declares that it \"only lends to organisations that actively do good\" - may seem pious, but it is also a shrewd, as well as enlightened, approach to risk. There's a rigour to the way it sizes up business loan applicants - \"If it was just an opportunity to make a lot of money out of something vaguely environmental, we would not be interested,\" says Middleton - that these days seems eminently sensible.</p> <p>Middleton says he is as surprised as most people at the scale of the crisis in the banking industry, but not shocked that the Triodos model has so far weathered the storm. Its sustainable approach to lending is matched by a governance structure that guards its mission and independence, and prevents volatile speculation in its shares. Middleton won't say how much he is paid - though it is almost certainly less than Triodos Group chief executive, Peter Blom, who earned \u20ac209,000 in 2007. Wage differentials are miniscule by banking standards: the salary of the highest remunerated Triodos UK employee is no more than seven times the salary of the lowest-paid employee. The collective reward scheme in the UK typically pays out a flat rate bonus of \"hundreds of pounds\" to each employee.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, there has been a recent upsurge of interest in Triodos from customers, bankers and policy makers, which Middleton welcomes, though he is anxious to emphasise it is not the only model: \"There should be a greater focus on different banking models, including our own, when the immediate concerns about many of our banks have been addressed.\" </p> <p><strong>Social responsibility</strong></p> <p>Changing the culture of an industry will not happen overnight, accepts Middleton. But the trauma suffered by the banking system will see a reassessment of banking fundamentals, he believes. Why shouldn't pressure from customers, shareholders and regulators - not to mention younger, more environmentally aware employees - force a recalibration of what the big banks mean by corporate social responsibility (CSR) and how they might integrate it into their core business? </p> <p>Not all banks may feel comfortable copying the Triodos mission statement (one part of which is to \"help create a society that promotes people's quality of life and that has human dignity at its core\") but in future it will make business sense, suggests Middleton, for banks to, say, make it a condition of a loan that the recipient reduces their carbon footprint. He is frustrated by the conventional CSR practice in which a bank gives 1% of profits to good causes: the social impact of this is paltry, he argues, compared to what could be achieved through a bank's loan book.</p> <p>Triodos has not been entirely unaffected by the downturn: the recession will mean tough times for many of its customers, says Middleton. But they tend to be less profit-driven, more resilient, less loaded with debt and not so exposed to the volatility of the markets. A tightening of consumer belts may affect the market for organic and fair trade produce. </p> <p>But amid the gloom, there are opportunities for growth, says Middleton, in sustainable social care, housing and renewable energy businesses. \"These are the core social and environmental issues,\" he says, \"that in the long-term affect all of us.\"</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.triodos.co.uk\">triodos.co.uk</a></p> <p><strong>Curriculum vitae</strong></p> <p><strong>Age:</strong> 51.</p> <p><strong>Lives:</strong> Bristol.</p> <p><strong>Status:</strong> Married; three children.</p> <p><strong>Education:</strong> Harrow school; Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst.</p> <p><strong>Career:</strong> 2003-present: managing director, Triodos Bank UK; 1980-2002: various management and director posts with Barclays bank in India, the Caribbean and Africa; 1976-80: Officer, British army, serving in Germany and Northern Ireland.</p> <p><strong>Interests:</strong> Photography; travelling; chair of the Haller foundation, an environment charity.</p>",
  "<p>The government yesterday abandoned a second key element of its counter terrorism bill when it dropped plans to allow inquests to be held in secret without a jury if they are deemed to put national security at risk. A day after peers overwhelmingly rejected controversial plans to detain terror suspects without charge for up to 42 days, the government said it would pursue the secret inquests in new, non-terrorism related legislation.</p> <p>The announcement means that the government has removed two of the most controversial elements of the counter-terrorism bill. Lord Falconer, the former lord chancellor, led a Labour rebellion in the Lords against the 42-day plan on Monday, which led to a government defeat by 191 votes.</p> <p>The government warned last night that Britain faces a growing terrorist threat when Lord West, the security minister, claimed that \"another great plot\" is being investigated. \"The threat is huge,\" West told peers. \"It dipped slightly and is now rising again within the context of 'severe'. There are large complex plots. We unravelled one, which caused damage to al-Qaida and the plots faded slightly. However, another great plot is building up again, which we are monitoring.\" </p> <p>The climbdown on secret inquests follows a report in August by a cross-party committee of peers which said that any decision to hold an inquest without a jury must be taken by a judge, not a minister.</p> <p>The government had proposed that the home secretary should be given the right to stop a jury being summoned, replace the coroner with a government appointee and hold the inquest in secret if it was deemed that an open hearing would jeopardise national security. </p> <p>Specially vetted coroners would sit in private without a jury if there was evidence involving national intelligence or anything deemed by the home secretary \"not to be in the public interest\". </p> <p>The government denied a U-turn. A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: \"Both the Commons and Lords have expressed a strong desire to debate the coroners' proposals within the context of wider coronial reform. We will therefore be removing the proposals from the counter-terrorism bill and bringing them forward again in legislation to reform the coroner system more widely. The government recognises that in a very small number of cases a change to the law may be required to enable inquests to go ahead where highly sensitive material is relevant.\"</p> <p>Dominic Grieve, the shadow home secretary, said: \"We welcome this decision. The counter-terrorism bill was no place for debating this extremely controversial measure, which should be in the coroners bill. It is vital that the independence and transparency of the coroners system is maintained - not undermined.\"</p> <p>A spokesman for the charity Inquest said: \"Deaths in custody and those involving issues of national security raise important issues of state power and accountability and should be subject to particularly close scrutiny.\" The government's approach to the inquests is similar to its handling of the 42-day issue. Jacqui Smith, the home secretary, said on Monday night that she would not seek to overturn the Lords vote. But she published a new bill on the 42-day plan to be introduced in the event of a major terrorist incident.</p> <p>Grieve yesterday told Smith that her new bill was flawed \"in that it contains very broad powers, limited safeguards and may in practice prejudice our shared objective of securing criminal convictions of those engaged in terrorism\". He questioned the need for a new bill when the existing civil contingencies act provided the authorities with strong powers.</p>",
  "<p>Jon Cruddas is right to highlight the government's failure to make a decision on the future of the post office card account (Poca), and the devastating effect that the loss of the Poca contract would have on what remains of the post office network (A ready made People's Bank, October 13). Card account transactions bring in an average of \u00a3249 income for sub-postmasters per month, accounting for 10% of their net pay. The National Federation of Sub-Postmasters has warned that a further 3,000 post offices could be forced to close if the government does not award the Poca contract to Post Office Ltd, in addition to the 2,500 branches which have already closed. </p> <p>Cruddas may not be aware that one political party has already warned of the devastation that would be wreaked by awarding the Poca contract to anyone but Post Office Ltd, and which has pledged to increase the functionality of the card account. A Conservative government would reform Pocas to enable people on lower incomes to benefit from the lower energy and water tariffs enjoyed by customers paying by direct debit.</p> <p>Approximately 8 million people in the UK do not have a bank account or \"act as unbanked\", withdrawing all their cash weekly. Many of these use a Poca. We would enhance Pocas so they can be used to pay utility bills by direct debit, cutting the bills of up to 2 million people by up to \u00a3200 a year, as well as generating new income for post offices. The government has rejected this policy because it contradicts its policy of managing the decline of the post office network, rather than developing new revenue streams. Cruddas will hopefully now join us in calling on them to reconsider.<br><strong>Alan Duncan MP</strong><br>Shadow secretary of state for business </p> <p>I have never understood how the Bank of England's monetary policy committee (MPC) could claim to control inflation without including house prices within its remit. Its purpose has been to focus on the consumer prices index, which excludes the costs of housing.</p> <p>Homes, our most expensive purchase, inflated madly; yet the government and the MPC boasted for many years that they were keeping inflation down. They were not telling us the whole truth.</p> <p>Now that the elephant in the room has crashed through the floor, I hope this will serve as a warning to future chancellors that they cannot ignore house prices when assessing inflation. The Bank should change to an inflation target that uses the retail prices index.<br><strong>Dr Amanda Goodall</strong><br>Warwick Business School </p> <p>According to Jackie Ashley (Comment, October 13), for much of Labour's period in office, Gordon Brown has been weighed down by the burden of asking what he was for. Now he knows. Or we hope that he knows: could it be that he's best at clearing up his own messes?</p> <p>In 1998 it was plain that the City, bankers and anyone else concerned with the greedy business of money \"making\" money would also have free licence to seduce the UK into an almighty addiction to debt. All the time, Brown looked the other way - to the detriment of several potentially radical policies, including ending child poverty. Now, political commentators appear to be swallowing the government propaganda line that Brown has only freshly arrived centre stage. Ashley writes: \"Brown has not yet spoken to the country as he ought to ... There was never a greater need for the right words, well spoken.\" Two from Brown will suffice: mea culpa.<br><strong>Yvonne Roberts</strong><br>London </p> <p>Your mini-profiles of the big four banks' CEOs include a line saying how much each of them \"earned\" last year.

  "<p>We recognise that something needs to be done to tackle binge drinking; however, rather than introducing a mandatory code, which we believe could result in unintended negative consequences, we believe that co-regulation between government and the drinks industry on alcohol promotions is the best way forward ('Free drinks for women' offers may be banned, October 13). Co-regulation would provide a retailing code that would govern promotions in the quickest and most effective way, and so would stop irresponsible promotions like the \"drink all you like\" ones the government identified. It would be an effective way to ensure that alcohol is always promoted responsibly as anyone who breached the new code would be severely punished by an independent body. </p> <p>Furthermore, co-regulation could also be introduced without the need for further legislation as it could be incorporated under the 2003 Licensing Act. Perhaps the government should stop looking to new legislation as the way forward and look to work in closer partnership with an industry that wants to help, is putting a lot of money and expertise into finding a way forward, and wants to do the best thing for the average person on the street who still enjoys his pint sensibly and doesn't need to be penalised for it. <br><strong>Benet Slay</strong><br>Managing director, Diageo GB</p>",
  "<p>An abducted 17-year-old girl made a desperate attempt to alert the emergency services to her plight by calling 999, but her call was disconnected and she was raped and murdered, a court heard yesterday. </p> <p>Hannah Foster called 999 in the hope that police would hear her conversation with Maninder Pal Singh Kohli, 40, who is accused of abducting, raping and murdering the A-level student, Winchester crown court was told.</p> <p>Nicholas Haggan QC, prosecuting, said a system to prevent accidentally dialled calls blocking emergency services phone lines discarded her call. \"Hannah's call was disconnected after only a very short period of time. There was no response to her attempts to get help,\" he said. </p> <p>The student was bundled into a van by the former sandwich delivery man while she was walking the short distance to her Southampton home after a night out with friends on Friday March 14 2003, the prosecution said. Her body was found by the side of a road on the outskirts of Southampton two days later.</p> <p>In the enhanced recording of Hannah's 999 call, the student tells a man speaking in heavily accented English that her name is Sarah, her sister's name. But her parents have confirmed that the recording is of Hannah, said Haggan. Listening to the prosecution's case in the public gallery, Hannah's parents, Hilary and Trevor, comforted their daughter Sarah, 20, as they heard details of the call. </p> <p>\"The operator is talking but despite that you will be able to hear that Hannah is very frightened,\" Haggan said. \"At some stage in the brief conversation the man tells Hannah 'hold your head down please'.\" </p> <p>The court heard that Mrs Foster, worried about her daughter, texted her at 5.30am and later called her at 6.30am on Saturday March 15, but received no response.</p> <p>On the same morning, Kohli, an Indian national living in Southampton with his wife and two young children, called a friend, Balwinder Chahal, in tears, asking for money for a plane ticket to India where he said his mother was ill, the court heard. Although Kohli sounded \"desperate\", the friend decided not to help. </p> <p>The following day Hannah's body was found in brambles near the side of the road in Allington Lane, in the West End area, near Southampton. </p> <p>Haggan told the court that from the dishevelled state of her clothing and DNA tests, it was clear that she had been raped and murdered. </p> <p>On Monday March 17 Hannah's handbag and mobile phone were found at a recycling plant in Portsmouth. They had been dumped in a public glass recycling bin in the Southsea area by Kohli on a detour from his sandwich delivery round, according to the prosecution. The bin was later transferred to the recycling plant.</p> <p>Early on Tuesday morning Kohli travelled from Southampton to Heathrow and flew to India after borrowing money from his father-in-law. The court heard that he had left his wife and two young sons behind three days before he was due to complete the sale of his house in the Portswood area of Southampton. </p> <p>A subsequent Crimewatch appeal, on March 26 2003, alerted James Dennis, Kohli's supervisor at Hazelwood Foods in Southampton, to the crime; he linked Kohli with the murder and called police.</p> <p>With Kohli a suspect, Haggan told the jury the \"pieces of the jigsaw very soon went into place\". His delivery van was seized and semen stains and Hannah's blood was discovered inside, he said.</p> <p>Through the examination of CCTV and automatic number plate recognition technology, police were able to locate Kohli's van early on Saturday March 15 on the M27 and M275 between Southampton and Portsmouth, he said. </p> <p>He said records of calls made to Hannah's mobile phone show the handset had been moving down the M275 outside Portsmouth at the same time as Kohli was captured on camera on the same motorway. </p> <p>The court was told that CCTV from a petrol station in Allington Lane, three miles from where Hannah's body was found, also showed Kohli's distinctive van three times early on Saturday morning. </p> <p>An arrest warrant was issued on April 3 2003, and more than a year later, on July 15 2004, Kohli was captured by Indian police and was finally extradited from India to the UK on July 28 2007. </p> <p>On his return police took DNA samples from him; they matched DNA recovered from Hannah's body and the van used by Kohli for his job, said Haggan. \"There was a one in one billion match probability,\" he said.</p> <p>Hannah was in her second year at Barton Peveril College in Eastleigh, where she was studying for her A-levels. </p> <p>\"She was not only an attractive young girl, she was highly intelligent. She achieved 11 GCSE A star passes. </p> <p>\"She was going to medical school,\" said Haggan.</p> <p>Kohli denies charges of murder, rape, kidnapping and false imprisonment.</p> <p>The trial continues.</p>",
  "<p>It is easier this month than last to make the case for effective regulation. Meltdown in the financial markets was caused by excessive risk-taking in banks and other institutions that were not subjected to adequate external scrutiny. And the same danger lurked in the public sector, as it became fashionable among politicians and managers to bemoan the burden imposed by inspectors poking their noses into state-run services and demanding shedloads of information to establish whether everything was well run.</p> <p>No wonder then that Sir Ian Kennedy, chairman of the Healthcare Commission, is now in bullish mood as he prepares for the publication tomorrow of the \"health check\" - the annual performance rating of England's 391 NHS trusts. He says: \"What's happening in the City right now demonstrates that the period of hostility to regulation is being rethought rapidly, particularly when the public's tax penny is involved. Calls for more regulation are growing as we speak.\"</p> <p>The commission has been pioneering a new approach to the inspection of public services, using all available data to trigger risk alerts.</p> <p>The NHS is too massive to inspect everything all the time. So the health check relies substantially on self-assessments by trusts, backed up by a system of intelligence gathering to identify those whose view of themselves may be unduly rosy.</p> <p>Kennedy is uncomfortable with the notion that he has adopted a \"big brain\" approach to regulation. It reminds him of a comic strip character called the Mekon, who was cerebrally magnificent, but detached from reality. He says: \"We are not pointy-heads sitting in London - like the Mekon, with a large green head, thinking about the world and not doing anything.\"</p> <p>The best known example of the commission's power to intervene came a year ago at Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells hospitals in Kent. It uncovered a shocking lapse in hygiene that had caused the deaths of 90 patients. The trust sacked its chief executive a few days before the commission's damning findings were published, and infection control at the hospitals has since improved.</p> <p>The commission has completed investigations of 14 trusts whose performance gave serious cause for concern. In some cases, it was invited in by a new chief executive who was worried about safety. But investigations that were triggered by the system of risk alerts were bad news for hospitals' senior management team.</p> <p>In seven cases, the chief executive departed around the time of the commission delivering its verdict on the trust. Heads have also rolled at hospitals that did not merit a full investigation, but where inspectors alerted regional NHS chiefs to a problem of low performance.</p> <p>Kennedy is reluctant to claim scalps, but he says: \"We have been a catalyst for challenging performance and causing a change of leadership in a number of places.\" The commission declined to estimate the number of sackings caused by its interventions.</p> <p>The problem with investigations is that they usually come after the event, so Kennedy has been working on a system of routine surveillance to ring the alarm bells sooner. His team analysed mortality data at every acute hospital to identify units where too many patients were dying, given the case mix and the normal risks attached. Kennedy disclosed that the process has generated 85 risk alerts, spread across 56 acute trusts. Just over half turned out to be false alarms, caused by glitches in the data. But the commission found cause for concern at 42 units in 29 trusts.</p> <p>At Mid Staffordshire foundation trust, it launched an ongoing investigation into safety. At other trusts, the problem was that senior management did not have the faintest idea about whether units were safe or not. They did not have accurate mortality data.</p> <p>Kennedy says: \"At the end of the first decade of the 21st century, that is not where the NHS should be. Mortality is an important indicator of performance. Not to know it in any real sense is disturbing.\" There were problems of this nature in around 20 trusts.</p> <p>He thinks the government had an ambivalent attitude to regulation. The department told him to expose bad practice, but then asked why he was giving the NHS bad headlines.</p> <p>Ministers never tried to bully the commission, Kennedy says, but they announced its abolition 11 months after it came into being. Inspection of health and social care will be taken over in April by the Care Quality Commission. News from the City suggests it may have become easier now to persuade the NHS high command of the value of regulation.</p> <p>\u2022 John Carvel is the Guardian's social affairs editor</p>",
  "<p>\"This is a truly horrifying case,\" said Mark Thomas, investigations officer for the RSPB, after Kyle Burden, a 19-year-old gamekeeper at the Kempton estate in south Shropshire, received a six-month suspended prison sentence after pleading guilty at Telford crown court last month to nine charges of killing buzzards and badgers, setting spring traps, and possessing a shotgun. \"Wildlife on this estate was killed brutally and systematically. Birds of prey were shot, badgers trapped and bludgeoned to death, seemingly without a second thought. The lack of respect for nature, the disregard for the law and the arrogance involved was total.\"</p> <p>A search found Burden's notebook, in which he used the five-bar gate notation to keep a tally of the number of rabbits, crows and other animals it is legal to kill, and then used coded headings for illegal kills: 40 under BB - black buggers, meaning ravens; 37 under Billy - a country name for a badger; and 102 under an asterisk - which stood for common buzzards. Buzzards and some other birds of prey are predators of game birds such as young pheasants and partridge, released into the countryside for sport shooting, which has become a large rural industry.</p> <p>The trial of Roger Venton, the head keeper at the Kempton estate, is set for December. Charged with five offences, he is pleading not guilty. Burden, who will be a witness, received a dismissal letter from his employer on the day of his sentence.</p> <p><strong>Potential victims</strong></p> <p>The 6,000-acre Kempton estate at Lydbury North, near Bishops Castle, is owned by Bettws Hall, one of Britain's largest pheasant and partridge shooting businesses, with estates in Wales and England and shoots in Spain and Argentina. A day's shooting in Shropshire, on beats with names such as Viagra, will cost \u00a31,650 per gun. The business claims to rear 300,000 game bird chicks per week. </p> <p>Is Kempton a rogue estate, or is persecuting birds of prey widespread? \"It is not decreasing,\" Thomas says. \"We get reports of red kites being poisoned, and one was shot in Northern Ireland this year, only three months after being reintroduced there following an absence of 200 years. The population of hen harriers in England is flatlining, and there are still no goshawks on the north-east moors of the Dark Peak in the Peak District. If there was no illegal killing, we would not see some gamekeepers at court in the frequency that we do.\"</p> <p>Alasdair Mitchell, a Shooting Times columnist and spokesman for the National Gamekeepers Organisation, says: \"I condemn [Burden's] behaviour: no ifs, no buts. There can be occasions when gamekeepers are under pressure, but this is a reason, not an excuse. If they are under pressure to break the law, we advise members to contact their employer or the police. There will still be some illegal persecution of birds of prey, but it should be seen in context. Only four gamekeepers have ever been convicted of anything to do with raptors. Of the 15 species of raptors in Britain, 14 are stable or increasing, having the highest populations for over 100 years.\" </p> <p>The RSPB, however, claims that the number of gamekeepers involved in wildlife offences now numbers 100.</p> <p>Burden's attitudes to wildlife seem completely at odds with modern times, as gamekeeping has changed in recent decades. Tom Blades, gamekeeping and game shooting officer for the British Association for Shooting and Conservation, says: \"We shouldn't forget that gamekeepers have contributed to the increasing populations of birds of prey through managing habitat, providing a food source, and protecting them. Their role in the raptor success story has been undervalued.\"</p> <p>It was because gamekeepers were horrified at what was going on at Kempton that the prosecution against Burden went ahead. \"Their actions were brave and public-spirited, and show the decent, law-abiding face of gamekeeping,\" Thomas says. Indeed, the RSPB will be launching a hotline for gamekeepers to report crimes against birds of prey.</p> <p>Legislation that protects wildlife, and particularly birds of prey, reflects a change in public attitudes. But while the distinction between what is \"wildlife\", and thus protected, and what is still \"vermin\", to be controlled by killing, may be enshrined in law, it may not appear so clear cut to those who are pressurised by commercial interests and steeped in rural traditions, which some see as being besieged by urban sentiments.</p> <p>The official persecution of wildlife-as-vermin was first enshrined in Henry VIII's Corn Laws, when almost everything from eagles to kingfishers had a bounty on its head. Killing wild animals became part of the fabric of the countryside. The rise of the 19th-century shooting estates brought the decline of raptors; it is only in the last few generations that the return of birds of prey to many parts of Britain has been seen. Buzzards, eagles, peregrine falcons, goshawks and sparrow hawks stir passions and become emblems of a wildness missing from Britain for centuries.</p> <p><strong>Romantic image</strong></p> <p>Burden's defence was that he is a dedicated countryman protecting his pheasants. A few decades ago, magistrates would have commended his efforts. Now, the romantic image of the countryman is tarnished by the idea of killing buzzards and badgers, which have become conservation icons. This is only the second jail sentence - albeit suspended in this case - for the killing of legally protected birds of prey, but it is unlikely to be the last.</p> <p>As raptor populations rise, another change is coming. \"The media equate protected with endangered,\" Mitchell says. \"Some raptor species have increased 400% since the 1950s and 60s. This is no excuse for illegal persecution, but we should be looking at non-lethal methods of control.\"</p> <p>Blade says: \"We are reaching the point where birds of prey have recovered, particularly the buzzard. We need a frank discussion about the problems this is causing, and what to do about it.\"</p> <p>Part of the problem is how we define wildlife and what status it has in society. An icon to one sector of society can become a demon to another: as raptors and badgers have become. Inevitably, some species will rub up against human interests, and where they do they can scuff the surface of our attitudes and values to reveal ways of thinking and acting we thought buried.</p> <p>If the Burden case is an aberration, the law will deal with it. If it reveals more about the legacy of killing in the countryside, and the distance between sections of rural society and what we think of as modern life, then it requires a very different approach.</p>",
  "<p>I was an ardent Anglophile until I moved to London. That was when I found out that having loved British culture since teenhood and been on vacation here a few times was no preparation for living here. Everything that had seemed exciting and fascinating about Britain when viewed from across the Atlantic was much less so up close when I arrived in 1982, dragging along a pink holdall packed with a flouncy vintage wardrobe and enough money to last six months. I had assumed that knowing everything there was to know about UK pop music was the only qualification I needed to feel at home in London and start a life here. How wrong could I have been?</p> <p>I'd been working as a waitress in a cocktail bar (someone should really make a song out of that) in New York, devoting my spare time to seeing gigs by British bands and buying their records from import shops. With no particular career ties to New York, I decided one New Year's Eve to go to my favourite city to live like a Londoner for a while. Ten months later, after saving $3,000, I arrived at Heathrow on an overcast October day.</p> <p>Hardly anything was as I'd expected. Spending the first three months on friends' sofas, then moving into a house-share in Deptford, south-east London, opened my eyes. And what I was learning, I didn't like. Everyday life wasn't the whirl of bands and stylishness I'd envisaged; it was perpetually grey skies, aloof people who resisted my overtures of friendship and a freezing house with the toilet in the backyard (this detail shocked me more than almost anything else; even more incredibly, my three housemates - all Brits - didn't seem to mind). </p> <p>Within a couple of months, I caught a cold that refused to go away, and I spent the next year snuffling into a hankie. With nothing to do during the day, when my housemates were at college, I rode around on buses and tubes to see where they went, then felt depressed by what I found: semi-detached 1930s suburbs that stretched to the horizon. Plodding around Epping or Uxbridge in the middle of a weekday, I couldn't get my head around the idea that Britain was not the arty wonderland of my delusions but, well, this.</p> <p>Why was everything so drab? How did people stand the dreariness? And, most frustratingly, why were they so resistant to getting to know people outside their usual social circle (ie me)? \"Yeah, but we're not shallow like Americans,\" one of my housemates \"explained\" when I asked. \"When you do become friends with a British person, they're your friend for life.\" Fantastic, but what did you do until the British person decided they'd known you long enough to admit you to their gang?</p> <p>What really brought me up short were the miners' and the Wapping printers' strikes. I just didn't get them. No American industrial dispute in my lifetime had riven the country as these did, and, ignorant of the background issues, I couldn't understand why they roused everyone I knew to such a pitch of (mainly anti-Tory) emotion. I knew nothing of British politics and social structures, why people were judged by their accents or why class was mentioned so often in newspaper leader articles.</p> <p>Young people were much more politicised than my friends at home, and took it as read that I was, too. \"Aren't you ashamed of what Reagan is doing?\" I was asked more than once - a question I couldn't answer, having spent most of his presidency pretty well oblivious to him. I'd come to England armed with only one fact about the UK government: that the prime minister was a woman, which seemed an excellent thing. As for the royal family, I had republican sentiments, insofar as they went, and instinctively hated the tabloids' deference to them. But it took a long time to unravel the ins and outs of it all, and while I slowly learned that the privatisation of national industries was a bad thing, and Margaret Thatcher and John Major even worse, my British friends - I'd finally made some - treated me </p> <p>with the condescension of people who knew their country was morally and culturally superior to mine.</p> <p>So you'll appreciate that I was almost entirely unsuited to living in England. Yet I refused to go back to New York. I was here, and I was going to stay here and figure the damned place out if it killed me. A member of my family was English, and I was able to get leave to remain. Ambivalently settled into long-term residency, I adopted a PJ O'Rourke-like bullishness about my Americanness. In his 1988 book of travel essays, Holidays in Hell, the Ohio-born journalist addresses a rant to a British acquaintance who had complained that Americans saw war as a John Wayne movie: \"We think war is a John Wayne movie. We think life is a John Wayne movie - with good guys and bad guys, as simple as that. And let me tell you who those bad guys are. They're us. WE BE BAD.\" </p> <p>As America's image went downhill through the 90s, I felt compelled to defend it, PJ-style. Don't diss my country, OK? And then 10 years had passed, and I was still here, but something else had taken root alongside the defensiveness. I could appreciate things now: the quiet beauty of the countryside, which had got under my skin and made me want to protect it; London's scruffy complexity, and the way most of its inhabitants good-naturedly put up with each other; the feeling that even if this is a sinking ship, it'll go down with humour and irony intact. Everything that had originally seemed shabby and desperate now felt comforting and homely. When Madonna refused to give birth to her second child in London because she considered the hospitals \"old and Victorian\", I was outraged. I knew how they appeared in her eyes, but also that if it had been me, I wouldn't have wanted to have the baby anywhere but my local King's College Hospital in south London (opened 1909), with its exemplary staff. I'd met some of them when I spent five days there with a broken knee, and thought them wonderful. Back in New York, my mother, who was socked with hefty health-insurance premiums every month, marvelled at the idea that the NHS had fixed my knee for free. \"They didn't charge you anything?\" she kept asking.</p> <p>I had even developed a fondness for the Queen - not the institution she represents, but the woman herself - as the one constant in my two decades here. And with all that came awareness that I loved this country. Around this time, about two years ago, I began to think about applying for citizenship. It would make my attachment to London feel complete - like getting married after lengthy cohabitation. And it would be a statement of commitment.</p> <p>When I found out how laborious the application process is, it took another year to get around to it. There's a 20-page form requiring two British referees, details of every absence from the country in the past five years and a tonne of documents, including tax returns and passport. But before you can send it, you need to pass the Life in the UK test, which was introduced in 2005 to ensure applicants had a grasp of what Britishness was about. My test centre was on a Clapham industrial estate, where 25 of us - a mix of South Americans, Africans and a sweet Iraqi guy who was taking it for the third time - were sitting in front of computers to answer the 24 questions. Bags had to be left on a table, and phones switched off. We were warned that if a phone rang during the test, its owner would automatically fail. </p> <p>We also agreed not to disclose details of the questions, so all I can say is: I'd thought 20 years of living here meant I'd sail through, but I was wrong. Now I understand why almost 200,000 of the 650,000 tests taken so far have ended in failure. I was expecting gifts such as, \"Who is the heir to the throne?\" but this was really tough. Despite a week swotting up with the official preparation guide (\u00a310 from WH Smith), I was flummoxed by half the questions. So much for 20 years.</p> <p>I passed, though, and duly sent everything to the Immigration and Nationality Directorate, with a cheque for \u00a3655 (increased from around \u00a3250 in 2006). Four months later, the IND replied, saying my application had been approved. And two weeks ago, at a ceremony for 40 of us at Lambeth Town Hall, I became British. </p> <p>The Mayor of Lambeth presided as we recited an affirmation of loyalty to the Queen, tinnily accompanied by a taped version of the national anthem. Then the mayor, who wore leisure slacks under her impressive robes, presented us with citizenship certificates. In the queue, I had a Turkish woman in front of me and a Colombian man behind, illustrating as well as anything the breadth of cultures drawn to this fantastic city. </p> <p>We had to speak over the noise of drilling outside, and Sellotape was peeling away from a picture of the Queen stuck to a curtain at the front of the room. Twenty years ago, the mildly shambolic state of it would have appalled me. Now I felt a surge of fondness at the Britishness of it all. When I got home, feeling slightly giddy, my housemate asked how my \"investiture\" had gone, and has since taken to calling me Sir Caroline. And my friend Amber gave me a card saying, \"Now you have to have a kebab and a fight to celebrate!\" It looks like I'm finally in the gang.</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama and John McCain this week revealed plans aimed at trying to help US families suffering from the economic crisis. The plans were the most detailed yet from two candidates who have little background in economics and who have struggled to come up with policies that have resonated with the US public. The McCain plan, unveiled yesterday and a day later than the Republicans intended, is costed by his team at $52.5bn (\u00a330bn). The Obama plan, announced on Monday, is costed by his team at $60bn.</p> <p><strong>Mortgages</strong>: An estimated 14 million American families are in trouble with their mortgages. McCain is proposing to buy mortgages directly from homeowners and mortgage companies and replace them with more manageable fixed-rate mortgages. Obama is also promising help for those in danger of losing their homes but is suggesting a three-month moratorium on repossessions.</p> <p><strong>Pensioners and struggling families</strong>: Pensioners are among those most directly hit by the stock market crash on Wall Street as well other bourses across the globe. But other families too are suffering from higher petrol prices, job losses and mortgage foreclosures. McCain is suggesting help for people aged 59 and over by lowering taxes to 10% on those who dip into retirement funds to help them through the present financial crisis. He also plans to suspend tax rules that force them to sell stocks as part of their retirement funds at a fixed date, which would penalise them given the low prices at present. Obama's plan is similar, but a significant difference is that his proposal applies to all, not just those over 59. He is proposing to provide immediate relief for struggling families by allowing everyone to dip into their retirement funds.</p> <p><strong>Jobs</strong>: Unemployment is predicted to reach 8% by the end of the year. McCain and Obama are proposing to scrap taxes on unemployment benefits, albeit only temporarily. Obama is proposing a job creation plan along the lines of the New Deal. This would involve federal lending to states for programmes to repair the country's crumbling infrastructure, including bridges, roads and schools. In addition to this, Obama is to offer a $3,000 tax credit for companies taking on new employees. He would also double loans to US car companies to help keep them afloat.</p>",

  "<p>Sir Dave Richards will not join England's World Cup 2018 bid campaign despite making more time for himself by stepping down as chairman of the Football Foundation.</p> <p>Richards, the chairman of the Premier League, has spent eight years with the funding body, during which time it has paid out more than \u00a3700m in grants for grassroots facilities. Through that position he has built contacts across the world - not least in the next World Cup host nation, South Africa.</p> <p>A strong emphasis on international development is one of the World Cup bid's stated aims. The Football Association had hoped to tap into Richards' knowledge and contacts by offering him a post as one of the World Cup bid vice-presidents. </p> <p>But with only Manchester United's chief executive, David Gill, from the Premier League deemed worthy of a board position, the FA has underestimated the damage its politician-heavy board has done to domestic relations. Richards, who is also chairman of the FA's international committee, has privately indicated it would be a snub to his league's members to accept the position.</p> <p>There is widespread astonishment in the international football community at the decision to leave Richards and his league's chief executive, Richard Scudamore, off the panel. It was the talk of the conference circuit last week, with even high-level Fifa executives expressing their surprise.</p> <p>Richards' last Foundation meeting as chair will be next Wednesday, at which the replacement for Tony Giddens, a labour peer who represented the government as a Foundation trustee before quitting last week, will be confirmed. Phil Smith, Sport England's director of sport, is expected to take up the role.</p> <h2>Ferguson's share scare</h2> <p>Manchester United continue to insist that the financial crisis will not affect their business, but one of their manager's interests may not be so robust. Sir Alex Ferguson continues to feature in promotional material for the commercial-property investment group aAIM, in which he is quoted as saying: \"As a founder shareholder and investor I have been impressed by the energetic team, their clarity of vision and by the consistent high returns they have delivered.\" The firm describes its investment model as \"utilising sophisticated financial leverage and acquisition structures\". At a time when companies are racing to \"deleverage\" - ie sell assets and pay back debts - that does not sound quite so attractive. Perhaps this is why Bank of Scotland's corporate division, part of one of the banks rescued by the taxpayer this week, is reported to have pulled out of its nine-figure commitment to the firm. HBOS and aAIM both declined to comment.</p> <h2>Charlton under hammer</h2> <p>Zabeel Investments, the Dubai sovereign-wealth fund which has lodged an \"indicative bid\" for Charlton Athletic, is pressing ahead with its 30 days' due diligence in the hope of closing the deal. It insists there has been no contact with West Ham United, begging the question of who from Dubai made the discreet approach to the Upton Park club. Contact was made on Monday but, with all roads in that emirate leading to the royal family, if Zabeel takes control of Charlton any serious bid for West Ham would present a stiff test to the Premier League's ownership rules. Those state that anyone who \"either directly or indirectly\" is involved in or has any influence over another Football League club will be \"disqualified from acting as a director\".</p> <h2>Italian clears the air</h2> <p>The Football Association's director of communications, Adrian Bevington, unwittingly sparked a diplomatic incident between Fabio Capello and the Spanish football federation after being caught on the hop in a live radio interview. Bevington admits he made an \"unfortunate slip\" in stating that Capello had been party to the decision not to play next February's friendly at the Bernab\u00e9u, scene of racist abuse aimed at several England players. But Capello has a say only in whom England play, not the venues, prompting the England manager - twice a title winner with Real Madrid - to take the unusual step of giving an interview to the Spanish sports daily Marca saying: \"It is a mistake by the FA's director of communications. I don't know how my name has appeared in this.\" The pair are understood now to be reconciled.</p>",
  "<p>So this is to be Brown's Falklands. Victory on Mount All-fall-down. Bonfire of the bonuses. Service in St Paul's. March-past by the Royal Troop of Derivatives Traders. Anthem to the Bankers' Brigade. Tomb of the Unknown Arbitrageur.</p> <p>A fortnight is clearly a long time in ideology. What fun historians will have with October 2008. Do you remember the hoary old days when they let Lehmans go bankrupt and refused to guarantee bank deposits? Where were you when a governor of the Bank of England worried about inflation and something called moral hazard? How tables turn. Socialism is now cock of the walk, capitalism mugged by reality.</p> <p>It is rubbish, total rubbish. Market failure has been compounded by brain failure of the discredited profession of economics, overwhelmed by journalistic wish-fulfilment and glee.</p> <p>The banks have not been \"nationalised\", just deluged with money. They remain pluralist and competitive institutions, with independent boards. Their workers are not civil servants. Investors retain their shares. The bonus culture will revive. The impresarios of greed have been punished, or at least a few of them. But this is not socialism in our time, just public money hurled at the face of capitalism.</p> <p>Guardian writers and Labour politicians have been drooling all week over what they call the \"collapse of the free market model\" of a modern global economy. They are simply wrong. All markets required regulating. It was regulation that failed last month, not the market economy. When a car is driven too fast and crashes it does not invalidate motoring.</p> <p>For the record, exactly the same gloating was heard after the crash of 1987. It too \"spelled the death of market economics\". As Martin Taylor, formerly of Barclays, said on the radio yesterday: \"Yes, people will return to old-fashioned banking - until they forget about what has happened.\" Then the game will start all over again. Business can do without most things, but not private banks.</p> <p>In a seminal encounter in the early 1980s, the late Nicholas Ridley was trying to persuade a reluctant Margaret Thatcher of the virtue of privatisation. She feared she would lose control over such key industries as oil, gas and electricity. Ridley pointed out that it was far easier to command the heights of the economy by statutory regulation than by public ownership, which was encumbered by trade unions and Treasury control. Thatcher was persuaded, and the age of Oftel, Ofgas and Ofcom was born.</p> <p>The one that got away was the City. Hence the fiascos at BCCI, Lloyd's, Barings and Black Monday. Hence too what happened when the new building society/banks, encouraged by Thatcher and her successors to this day, went potty over homeownership. Britons were told that house-buying was the sensible way to save. Ministers would declare the \"right to homeownership\" and demand that \"every young person be helped on to the housing ladder\".</p> <p>Nobody cared how much this might impoverish them, or who lent the money or how, provided ministers could take credit for soaring homeownership. Nobody even cared when the negative-equity crisis burst in 1991.</p> <p>I carry no torch for the recklessness of the bonus culture, but it is politicians, not bankers, who should be apologising for the housing bubble. As for the bonus-drenched BBC constantly demanding that bankers \"say sorry\" for bonuses, words fail me. And its bonuses are not even earned.</p> <p>The toxic housing loans that were the cause of the credit crash will take time to bleed out of bank balance sheets. But bleed they will.</p> <p>Provided politicians can be restrained from re-hyping the British and American housing markets, the system will return to normal. Taxpayers will then get their money back, as shares are sold in tranches when the market suits. This is state \"greenmailing\", albeit on a grand scale, as was done with British oil shares in the 1980s. Governments will have performed their proper function in easing market adjustment after the bursting of a bubble.</p> <p>How quickly this works will depend on how far ministers show they understand banks. The toxic loan scandal began with politicians mesmerised by house-buying. MPs even expected taxpayers to pay their own mortgages for them. Mortgage splurging became so politically correct that nobody dare associate it with loan sharkery.</p> <p>On Monday Brown demanded that the banks in which he now has an interest stop paying dividends and bonuses, and return mortgage lending to its 2007 level. This was the surest way both to send bank shares through the floor and to revive the sub-prime chaos. Lady Vadera, the minister for economic competitiveness and small business, then added to the confusion by wanting the banks only \"to maintain the same level of marketing and availability\" of their mortgage offers. What does that mean? </p> <p>Brown's purpose in aiding the banking sector should be simply to guarantee a revival of reputable borrowing, not to pick and choose. Forcing banks to eschew commercial decisions and make bad mortgage loans will drive them back to dodgy derivatives. The arrival on the scene of Vadera, author of the chaotic nationalising of Railtrack, is hardly inspiring. These people have failed the whelk-stall test too often for comfort.</p> <p>All this has nothing to do with the death of capitalism, rather with its resuscitation after a nasty accident. As every student of economics knows, capitalism depends on confidence, and confidence depends, in the final analysis, on power. Belatedly, governments are feeling their way to honouring this responsibility.</p> <p>But we should repeat the cause of the crash. It was British and American politicians who encouraged people to buy houses they could ill-afford. They duly acquired assets that would, in most cases, be realised not by them but by their children. In the rest of Europe these people would be renting their homes and saving in a safer and more liquid fashion.</p> <p>The first round of let's-play-banker by Brown and Vadera this week suggests that this housing madness is far from cured. We should therefore expect that its message will again be forgotten and the sickness eventually return.</p> <p>Though bankers are more fun to blame, it was politicians whose laxity and craving for popularity lay at the root of the present trouble. They should at least be denied any triumph for aiding its cure.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:simon.jenkins@theguardian.com\">simon.jenkins@theguardian.com</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Friday October 17 2008.

  "<p>'Will the world and humankind be very much the poorer if we lose a thousand or so species?\" asks Marcel Berlins (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/08/features.comment\">G2, October 8</a>) in response to an International Union for the Conservation of Nature report revealing that 1,141 of the 5,487 known species of land mammal are at risk of extinction. </p> <p>Berlins acknowledges that he is being deliberately provocative and would genuinely like an answer to this question. As a conservation biologist, I can provide one. </p> <p>Berlins states: \"I passionately believe in saving the whale, the tiger, the orang-utan, the sea turtle and many other specifically identified species.\" Leaving aside the false notion that there is a single species of whale or sea turtle, who gets to identify these lucky chosen species? On what basis? Berlins seems to confuse the relative importance of conserving any particular species with its emotional appeal to the wider public.</p> <p>He continues: \"What I do not accept is the general principle that all species alive today should carry on existing for ever. We have become so attuned to treating every diminution of animals, insects, birds or fish with concern that we have forgotten to explain why we think it so terrible.\"</p> <p>No species exists for ever, and there is no principle that suggests any species should - extinction is a natural process, as the fossil record demonstrates. What is not natural is the rate of current extinctions in comparison to this natural \"background\" extinction rate. From documented extinctions alone (which are gross underestimates of the true number), the current rate is 100-1,000 times greater than the natural rate. Future extinction rates due to habitat destruction are predicted to be several times higher. </p> <p>Berlins questions the \"usefulness\" of some species, saying: \"Many species at risk are very close to other species that are not at risk; the differences are so small that only the scientists have any interest in them.\" Nature is incredibly complex and all species (including humans) are dependent on many others. Several studies have demonstrated that biological diversity is crucial to the sustained functioning of many of the ecosystems that humans rely on for food, materials, medicine, nutrient cycling, etc. It is very difficult to determine the precise detail of a species' \"functional role\", and impossible to judge with any certainty which species we can \"afford\" to lose. </p> <p>There are countless examples of species that may look superficially similar to the casual observer but that are really quite different - the length of a bumblebee's tongue determines which floral species it pollinates, for example. You cannot just substitute one bumblebee species for another without risking the loss of large groups of flowers (including important economic crops) and all of the species that have symbiotic associations with those flowers.</p> <p>Our preference for certain species bears no relationship at all to their \"importance\" in the ecosystem, or the morality of any human-induced extinction event. To borrow the words of Aldo Leopold, the great American ecologist: \"The first rule of intelligent tinkering is to save all the pieces.\"</p> <p>\u2022 Dr Kirsty Park is a lecturer in ecology and conservation biology at the University of Stirling </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:k.j.park@stir.ac.uk\">k.j.park@stir.ac.uk</a></p>",

This time last year, Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling were struggling to prevent Northern Rock from being nationalised; such was the stigma attached to state ownership. Today, nobody bats an eyelid when the Treasury takes a 60% stake in RBS or when the Bush administration takes an equity stake in Goldman Sachs.</p> <p>Clearly, policy-makers never really wanted to be in this position. The UK government said in the middle of last week that its aim was to purchase non-voting shares in British banks and had no desire to put people on boards. That view changed when the markets collapsed on Friday and Whitehall had more control over the commanding heights of the economy than it has had for 30 years.</p> <p>The question is what to do with this influence. Some measures look like no-brainers: the government should appoint a wider range of stakeholders, including customers and workers, to bank boards to ensure that there is no return to the clubby, you-scratch-my-back world of supine oversight by ineffective non-executive directors. It seems obvious, also, that the government should insist on a more sober and conservative model of banking. Ministers send out the wrong signals when they say they want lending to business and consumers to return to 2007 levels: it was lax lending that got us into this mess in the first place.</p> <p>This, though, is an opportunity for global as well as domestic reform. In the past, any efforts at cracking down on tax havens, for example, has been stymied by the knowledge that the US and the UK were reluctant to play ball. One of the unintended consequences of the crisis is that it has legitimised coordinated global intervention. There is the chance to make finance once again the servant of the public, which is as it should be.</p> <p>One obvious reform is to introduce a tax on international currency transactions. This idea has been knocking around since US economist James Tobin first suggested it in the early 70s, but the lack of interest in Washington and London has meant it never gained traction. </p> <p>Set at a lower level it would raise considerable sums of money. If a levy of just one basis point (one hundreth of 1%) was placed on all currency deals, governments would find themselves with an additional $70bn a year. At a time when they are chucking vast amounts of taxpayers' money at the banks, that would be a nice little earner, and might help assuage the concerns that the public are going to pay for the folly of financiers.</p> <p>There are alternative uses of the cash, of course. In Washington at the weekend, Britain's international development secretary, Douglas Alexander, said that the needs of poor countries should not be forgotten simply because the developed world had problems of its own. He was right, but inevitably the cost of bailing out the banks will put a strain on public finances in the west and tempt countries to scale back on development pledges. A currency transaction tax set at 2 basis points, assuming no evasion and no impact on trading volumes, would be enough to ensure that all the UN development goals were met by 2015.</p> <p>The second benefit of a currency transaction tax is as a calming measure during a crisis. Tobin didn't really envisage his tax being used as a revenue-raising device. Rather, he saw it as a way of slowing down the speculative movements of capital that can destabilise economies. There would be no chance of doing so with a levy set at one or two basis points; for that a two-tier scheme would be needed, with a modest impost in normal times and a much higher tax when times get tough. The question of when a problem becomes a crisis should not worry policy-makers. As the past month has shown, when you are in one, you know it.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:larry.elliott@theguardian.com\">larry.elliott@theguardian.com</a></p>",

  "<p>French attempts to craft a global warming pact to make the EU a world leader in tackling climate change are gridlocked, with governments unable to agree on how to share the pain and costs of slashing greenhouse gases by 20% within 12 years.</p> <p>A European summit tonight in Brussels will fail to agree on the means to the end of meeting the EU's ambitious targets, warned diplomats and officials.</p> <p>The deal has to be struck by the end of the year for the package, which was agreed unanimously by European governments 18 months ago, to become European law.</p> <p>But senior officials and diplomats doubt whether that will be possible despite the fanfare that accompanied the unveiling of the policy last year. </p> <p>\"The targets have been agreed and we have presented them all over the world,\" said Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, the European Commission chief. \"There will be a real problem of credibility for Europe.\"</p> <p>He added: \"Saving the planet is not an after-dinner drink, a digestif that you take or leave. Climate change does not disappear because of the financial crisis.\"</p> <p>Nicolas Sarkozy, France's president and current EU president, has been told that his proposals for tonight's summit have no chance of being supported, with some of the 27 countries arguing that the financial crisis means that the Europeans can no longer afford the huge costs entailed.</p> <p>\"In this difficult situation, it's only natural that governments become more defensive and prudent,\" the European Commission chief said.</p> <p>On Monday, Franco Frattini, the Italian foreign minister, told a meeting of his European counterparts that, with Europe heading into recession, the entire complex package should be renegotiated.</p> <p>The foreign secretary, David Miliband, opposed the Italian demands, arguing that if Europe was grappling with the credit crunch, it also was confronting a \"resource crunch\" that made the climate change package all the more urgent.</p> <p>But while British ministers say they support the plan, they are also trying to water down some of its key provisions. The energy and climate change secretary, the foreign secretary's brother, Ed Miliband, last week failed to get the rest of the EU to exempt the aviation sector from a central element of the climate change package - that which obliges Europe to obtain 20% of its energy mix from renewable sources by the 2020 deadline.</p> <p>Sarkozy's effort to build a consensus has already seen him scale back his ambitions, according to sources. But he has still encountered a wall of insuperable opposition on several fronts.</p> <p>The heart of the plan is the so-called emissions trading scheme which forces European industries to buy permits to pollute, encouraging them to save money by becoming cleaner.</p> <p>But amid furious objections, particularly from Germany, Sarkozy has proposed that especially energy-intensive industries such as the steel, aluminium and cement sectors be awarded their pollution permits for free to prevent them abandoning Europe and moving their business elsewhere. Britain and others reject the blanket exemption for these sectors. </p> <p>However, there is also widespread concern that Europe will simply export jobs and businesses without making any difference to carbon dioxide emissions.</p>",
  "<p>In the annals of show business, there have been many fraught relationships between famous fathers and less famous sons with tragic consequences - the sons of John Barrymore, Bing Crosby and Marlon Brando all suffered pitiful destinies - but there have been few as tempestuous as that between Guillaume Depardieu, who has died of pneumonia aged 37, and G\u00e9rard, his celebrated father. Sadly, his death came at a time when he had emerged from under the shadow of his father as a compelling actor in his own right. </p> <p>Both his parents being actors - his mother Elisabeth founded an international summer school of cinema - Guillaume seemed destined to follow them into films. Born in Paris, he first appeared on screen at the age of three, playing G\u00e9rard's son in Claude Goretta's Pas Si Mechant Que \u00c7a (The Wonderful Crook, 1974), followed by Tous les Matins du Monde 17 years later. In this meticulous recreation of 17th-century French musical life, he was dashing (if a bit wooden) as the composer and viola da gamba virtuoso Marin Marais. G\u00e9rard appeared as the older Marais. </p> <p>By this time, Guillaume had already served two jail sentences for theft and drugs offences, and had accepted money a few times for sex with men when he was broke. It was part of a rebellion against his father, whom he later accused of neglecting him as a child. </p> <p>After a few years of \"wasting my life\", Guillaume, with his characteristic long blond hair, co-starred in Pierre Salvadori's Les Apprentis (The Apprentices, 1995) in which he played a touching incompetent, winning a C\u00e9sar award as most promising newcomer. Two months before the film's release, he had a motorcycle accident. While in hospital for knee surgery, he picked up a viral infection that weakened his right leg so much that, after 17 operations, in 2003 he had to have it amputated. </p> <p>Meanwhile, he married the actor Elise Ventre and tried to get his career together again. Improving all the time, he was well cast as a wealthy dilettante who becomes a tortured, starving writer in Leos Carax's wildly romantic Pola X (1999) and was impressive in two further films directed by Salvadori: ... Comme Elle Respire (1998), as a petty crook who kidnaps a girl (Marie Trintignant) who he thinks is rich, and Les Marchands de Sable (The Sandmen, 2000), an effective film noir. </p> <p>In a television production of The Count of Monte Cristo (1998), Guillaume was Edmond Dant\u00e8s as a young man. As in Tous les Matins du Monde, G\u00e9rard portrayed the hero as an older man: father and son, barely on speaking terms at the time, avoided playing any scenes together. A few years later, their awkward relationship was reflected (and exploited) in the preposterous melodrama Aime Ton P\u00e8re (released under the title of A Loving Father, 2002) in which both G\u00e9rard and Guillaume, as Nobel-prizewinning novelist and estranged son, seemed ill at ease. It was their last feature together. </p> <p>In 2003, Guillaume was given a nine-month suspended prison sentence and fined \u20ac9,000 for threatening a man with a gun in a bar in Trouville. A few months ago, he was arrested again, this time for driving his scooter while intoxicated. The incident seemed to alienate G\u00e9rard even further from his son. As he told Paris Match, \"He's a real poet who touches me enormously, but who is very difficult, incorrigible ... I cut things off because I no longer want to be the wall, or the trash bin, where one dumps anything one wants. He has tried to contact me but I don't reply.\" </p> <p>A year later, Guillaume wrote in his ghosted autobiography, Tout Donner (Giving Everything), \"G\u00e9rard Depardieu is a coward, a cheat and lazy ... [he] is obsessed by the desire to be loved and the need for money ... I love him and I detest him for the same reasons ... For his impotence ... For his way of fleeing life, and fighting against it at the same time.\"</p> <p>Again he bravely picked up his career, being especially striking in Jacques Rivette's intellectually satisfying and subtly erotic Don't Touch the Axe (2007), in which the graceful by-play between Guillaume and Jeanne Balibar is a joy to behold. \"Thanks to Rivette,\" he said, \"I have begun to believe in cinema again.\" He also began to believe more in himself, working on several interesting films such as La France (2007) and De La Guerre (2008), and was shooting a film in Romania with the resonant title of L'Enfance d'Icare (The Childhood of Icarus) when he fell fatally ill. </p> <p>He is survived by his six-year-old daughter by his ex-wife and, of course, by his imposing father, with whom he was reconciled at last.</p> <p>\u2022 Guillaume Depardieu, actor, born April 7 1971; died October 13 2008</p>",
  "<p>Northern Rock vowed yesterday to pay back its multibillion-pound loan on time despite sharply deteriorating house prices and a looming recession that has sent arrears and repossessions rocketing in recent months.</p> <p>The lender, which was nationalised earlier this year, said former directors at the centre of the group's collapse last summer would escape legal action after a lengthy investigation was unable to detect sufficient evidence of wrongdoing.</p> <p>The bank's chairman, Ron Sandler, said a report by the law firm Freshfields and the accountants KPMG into the previous regime, headed by the former chief executive Adam Applegarth, had found \"insufficient grounds to proceed with any legal action for negligence\".</p> <p>He said the report, which was accepted by the bank's board, would allow directors to focus on the organisation's future, which remained \"challenging\" while the economy continued to slow down.</p> <p>The bank said in a third-quarter trading statement that it was \"well ahead\" of its government loan repayment target, having paid back more than half of the \u00a326bn it owed, to leave \u00a311.4bn outstanding as at September 30.</p> <p>Northern Rock hit the headlines a fortnight ago when it revealed that savers panicked by the financial meltdown had deluged the bank with demands to deposit cash. Savers saw the publicly owned operation, which still has 70 branches, as a safe haven during a period of turbulence in financial markets and uncertainty over the future of several high-street rivals.</p> <p>The Newcastle-based bank withdrew several savings products and put a cap on others to comply with EU rules limiting it to 1.5% of the savings market so as not to distort competition.</p> <p>In a trading statement, the bank said that while it had successfully built a strong deposit base, it was finding it difficult to making further repayments of the loan. Sandler said: \"We have continued to repay the government loan well ahead of plan; our deposit base is growing; our restructuring programme has been completed successfully, and a new and stronger management team is now in place. These are encouraging developments. </p> <p>\"But I don't want to convey the impression that any of this is going to be easy or anything other than arduous. Dislocated financial markets and falling house prices mean that the pace of progress achieved to date will be significantly more challenging to maintain going forward,\" he said.</p> <p>Arrears of more than three months jumped to 1.87% in September from 1.18% in June, while repossessions increased from 3,710 in June to 4,201 in September, the company said.</p> <p>Sandler said the worsening outlook for the economy was likely to lead to a further rise in arrears and repossessions on its 600,000 mortgage accounts. </p> <p>Most of the repossessions were for properties secured with a \"Together\" mortgage, which allowed buyers to borrow up to 125% of the property's value. Together mortgages account for 80% of loans triggering repossession orders.</p> <p>Before running into funding problems last summer, Northern Rock was one of Britain's biggest and most aggressive mortgage providers.</p> <p>It was forced to turn to the Bank of England for emergency support after the money markets froze, leaving the group facing a funding crisis. A run on the bank saw it haemorrhage billions of pounds of deposits before a government guarantee stabilised its business. Months of searching for a private-sector buyer failed and the bank was nationalised in February.</p> <p>More than 1,500 staff lost their job, of which 800 came through compulsory redundancies. </p> <p>The lender has been reducing the size of its mortgage book in order to pay back its government borrowing, and repaid \u00a315.4bn during the nine months to September 30. Repayments have fallen dramatically in recent months, leading to concerns that the bank will struggle to pay back the government without becoming more aggressive in tackling arrears.</p> <p>Some mortgage brokers and anti-poverty campaigners have already warned that Northern Rock has moved quickly to repossess homes after customers have fallen into arrears. The Consumer Credit Counselling Service, which handles thousands of calls each month from distressed bank customers in debt, has accused the bank of lacking any care or leniency in its dealings with customers.</p> <p>Sandler rejected the charge, arguing that the company and its staff made efforts to keep people in their homes whenever possible.</p>",

  "<p>Good things to emerge from the government's majority shareholding in the Royal Bank of Scotland? Well, there is the fact that Gordon now controls the Conservative party's banker of choice. The Tories have never given him the appropriate respect. This might get their attention. But better than that, thanks to the takeover, we the taxpayer now control a private jet, a \u00a317m Dassault Falcon. Sir Fred Goodwin, aka Fred The Shred, was rather partial to using it but even he knew that to keep it idle in Edinburgh would have been less than wise. So it is safely housed in Paris. Officials are understood to be checking the records to see what jollities it might have facilitated in the dying days of empire. Sir Fred was keen on motor racing, and inquiries may establish whether vital bank business was conducted at the French Grand Prix in June or the German a month later. At the same time, many wonder how long the sponsorship of the BMW Williams team will last now that Sir Fred has walked away, but strangely there is less concern about the continuing sponsorship of rugby. Gordon likes rugby.</p> <p>\u2022 And yes, he was a bit rash in comparing himself to Churchill, but then we must forgive him. Think of how dreadful the year has been so far. And yet he is not the only hero now stalking the House of Commons, for we understand that the Upstairs-Downstairs row - in which MPs formalised their right to barge in front of their underlings in lifts, shops and libraries - is raging unabated. The authorities keep erecting signs, reminders that the rights of man have been set aside. As quickly as the signs go up, Martin Salter, MP for Reading West and leader of the resistance movement, takes them down. Currently they litter his office. \"I keep telling them, 'It's me. I'm guilty,'\" Salter tells us, \"and yet nothing happens.\" Round up the usual suspect, goes the cry. Oh, it's him. Don't bother.</p> <p>\u2022 Yes, the house is full of heroes after the collapse of the 42-day detention plan. We'd buy a drink for David Davis but, as Glasgow MP Tom Harris blogged from the scene, he has already had one. \"As I write this, the Rt. Hon. David Davis and Shami Chakrabarti are celebrating the defeat by the Lords of the government's plans for 42 days pre-charge detention over champagne in the Pugin room in the Commons. I'm glad she has a reason to smile at last,\" he wrote. \"I wonder if they've invited Andy Burnham to join them?\" He didn't make it but a large crowd had quite a party. He wasn't missed. </p> <p>\u2022 It seems only reasonable that MI5, MI6 and GCHQ should give all sections of society ample opportunity to work for them. The net is being thrown far and wide. This from a missive recently dispatched to the hallowed halls of Cambridge. \"Hello, all. This email is to alert you all to the fact that GCHQ in Cheltenham is again looking to recruit classics graduates to retrain, mainly in non-European languages,\" it says. \"Classics graduates were very successful last year and we are hoping to repeat the exercise.\" And who knows, one or two of them may be able to suggest a friend from one of the lesser seats of learning, perhaps a former polytechnic. Don't knock it. It's strange but it works. </p> <p>\u2022 Aggrieved by the two disastrous byelection showings for the BNP in north London in recent weeks - 57 votes amassed from 5,700 cast in total - rednecks vent their anger on the even nastier fascist website, Stormfront.

  "<p>The mother of Rhys Jones, the 11-year-old killed on the way home from football practice, yesterday told how \"football was his life\" and described how she cradled him in her arms after he had been shot.</p> <p>Melanie Jones's statement was read to a hushed Liverpool crown court.

  "<p>The triple world champions Jackie Stewart and Niki Lauda have attacked the system of FIA stewards presiding over matters of race discipline at grands prix and criticised the rash of penalties that have been handed out by the stewards this season.</p> <p>Stewart, champion in 1969, 1971 and 1973, said: \"At the present time the governance of the sport is largely being managed by part-time amateurs. However well intentioned these people are, they just do not have sufficient knowledge to do these jobs. But this situation is going to continue unless the formula one teams start to stand up for themselves, go to Bernie Ecclestone, the commercial rights holder, and say that these decisions are jeopardising the integrity of the sport.\"</p> <p>For Lauda, who won the formula one title in 1975, 1977 and 1984, the major concern was that the stewards' actions were interfering with the drivers' ability to race. \"The worrying thing for me is that the stewards are really getting too involved in trying to control what the drivers are doing,\" he said. Both were moved to speak out by incidents in Sunday's Japanese grand prix when Lewis Hamilton and Felipe Massa both received drive-through penalties. The British driver was penalised for running wide at the first corner after the start, scattering the field in all directions, and the Brazilian for driving his Ferrari into the side of Hamilton's McLaren, putting the Briton into a spin which dropped him to the tail of the field.</p> <p>Later in the race, Massa spun after colliding with S\u00e9bastien Bourdais as the Frenchman accelerated his Torro Rosso back on to the circuit after a pit stop. Bourdais was held responsible and received a 25sec penalty, elevating Massa from eighth to seventh in the final results and putting him only five points behind Hamilton in the drivers' championship with two races left.</p> <p>\"You've got to remember that Bourdais was racing for a championship point every bit as seriously as Massa was, so to put him back and hand Massa another point at this fragile and very late stage in the championship certainly did not seem right,\" said Stewart, who believes full-time paid officials should be given the role.</p> <p>Lauda agreed with Massa's penalty but thought it absurd that Hamilton had been penalised. \"All Lewis was doing was braking late into a corner, which he is perfectly entitled to do,\" he said. \"The stewards should only start getting involved when something really serious occurs.\"</p> <p>Martin Whitmarsh, the McLaren chief executive, said of Hamilton's penalty: \"I don't understand [the stewards' decision] at the moment but I'm sure there must have been other things that I didn't see. Clearly Lewis did not believe that anything he did warranted a penalty.\"</p> <p>It is not the first time this season that Hamilton has suffered at the hands of the stewards. At the Belgian grand prix he was relegated from first to third through receiving a 25sec penalty for cutting a chicane in an overtaking duel with the Ferrari driver Kimi Raikkonen. In the season's second grand prix, at Malaysia, the Englishman and his team-mate, Heikki Kovalainen, were demoted five places on the starting grid after the pair were ruled to have deliberately impeded rivals during qualifying. The governing body, the FIA, said it had no comment to make.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Max Mosley's quest to reduce the cost of formula one will see him propose the imposition of standardised parts over the next five years, with engines regulated from 2010 and many more parts being controlled by 2013. In documents sent to team principals before a meeting in Geneva next week, the FIA president highlights \"parts which are the subject of major expenditure but add nothing to the spectacle or the public interest in formula one\".</p> <h2>2008 penalties to date</h2> <p><strong>Australia </strong>Kazuki Nakajima picks up a 10-place grid penalty for Malaysian GP for shunting Robert Kubica.

  "<p>The Belarus coach, Bernd Stange, has been seeking solace in England's first-half toils against Kazakhstan on Saturday as he considers how best to check the visitors' momentum at the top of Group Six in tonight's World Cup qualifier.</p> <p>Stange, a former coach of East Germany who subsequently steered Iraq to fourth place in the 2004 Olympics, received a detailed report on the match at Wembley from a Bundesliga coach who was there and he will attempt to thwart England tonight in the same way the Kazakhs did in the first period. But, denied his star player Alexander Hleb through injury, the German said that the visitors would pose a threat to his side all over the pitch.</p> <p>\"I personally didn't see the whole match against Kazakhstan, just the highlights,\" said Stange, who has been preparing in his native Germany with his squad. \"Our spy - the German coach I've mentioned before at a Bundesliga club - faxed me a detailed match analysis and it looks as if England had real problems in the first half. We must draw encouragement from that.</p> <p>\"They ended up gaining an impressive victory, with Wayne Rooney and the quick Theo Walcott the best players in [Fabio]Capello's side as well as the dangerous Frank Lampard in midfield. They caused problems in the air at set pieces so I'm glad to have Yegor Filipenko and Dzmitry Verkhovtsov in defence; with their height and heading abilities we hopefully will not lose out in the air as Kazakhstan did.\"</p> <p>Hleb had already singled out Walcott, his former team-mate at Arsenal, as a potential thorn for the Belarus defence, and the Parma forward Vitaly Kutuzov acknowledged the threat posed by the young winger. \"Walcott produced a hat-trick from nowhere against Croatia and it's true that we have had problems down our own left wing,\" he said. \"But I'm not worried. I'm sure we will find a solution for the game. I can play as a left-winger if needed.</p> <p>\"As far as we are concerned, we know what we have to do. A draw will not be enough given our situation in the group [they have won one and lost one to date]. We have to go into the winter break in a better mood with our prospects improved with a win.\"</p> <p>Hleb's absence with an ankle injury sustained last month while playing for Barcelona against Racing Santander is a cruel blow. The midfielder had hoped to prove his fitness in time for the sell-out tie at the Dinamo Stadium but Barcelona are not convinced he has recovered sufficiently.</p> <p>They had been reluctant this week even to release him to watch the game in case his desire to play clouded his judgment.</p> <p>\"Our captain, Alex, wanted to come to Minsk, not to play but just to offer moral support, but Barcelona had refused to let him go,\" said Stange. \"Maybe they were afraid I was going to play him.\"</p> <p>The Calatan club's fears have since been allayed and he was at the Dinamo stadium last night and will be present tonight to watch his team-mates play without him.</p>",
  "<p>If England Expects, Graham Taylor's ITV documentary about the pressures faced by the national team manager, was supposed to be a sequel to An Impossible Job, the 1994 film in which he effectively skewered himself, it was more Godfather III than II. The best bits of the new programme were inevitably those soundbites delivered in 1993 from the touchlines in Oslo and Rotterdam, the \"can we not knock it\" and \"I'm a metre\" that must still cause him to wake, as he put it at the time, in \"the usual wet pyjamas\".</p> <p>Many of we fools who traded our vinyl for peanuts years ago have frequent cause to regret it, but last week was the first time I have kicked myself for chucking out the football video tapes accumulated over 20 years. This was done on the spurious grounds that I never watched them any more. Halfway through the Taylor show I began to look forward to watching the original only to remember that my copy had long since made its way to a landfill site along with countless other gems of sporting documentary.</p> <p>In the 90s I used to work in a bookshop, Sportspages, and every day a small crowd of customers would huddle before the TV as the poor sod behind the counter was inundated with requests to stick on a particular tape. The regulars would jostle each other over whose turn it was to choose. The top three were Danny Baker's Own Goals and Gaffes, (something we watched so often that even now if someone says \"Crystal Palace\" I can't help but add Baker's \"horrible suburban\" prefix to the south London side), The Boys from Brazil, John Motson's history of the Selecao, and the one known to our clientele as \"that Turnip one\".</p> <p>Although the shop made its name for the huge range of books and fanzines it stocked, it also benefited from a golden age in sports video production. Before the BBC realised the size of the market for the treasure in its archive, your main option was sending off a postal order for \u00a320 to a bloke in Walsall who had placed a classified advert in the back of World Soccer. After the customary 28-day wait, if you were lucky you might receive a compilation of goals taped off The Big Match and the local news so covered in static snow that you would be stuck on your knees endlessly twiddling with the tracking button.</p> <p>Perhaps it was the boom in these bootlegs that persuaded the corporation to get its act together and for a brief period its commercial arm commissioned an array of videos covering the histories of teams, profiles of legends and great matches. The series, from the magnificent 101 Great Goals, studded with David Coleman's cries of \"one-nil\" and peculiar pearls such as \"goals pay the rent and Osgood does his share\", to Motson's splendid tributes to the Mancunian holy trinities of Best, Law and Charlton and Lee, Bell and Summerbee, was BBC Sport at its most incisive.</p> <p>They were so successful because opportunities to see the footage within them had been so scarce in the pre-video age. But what made them distinctive was the time they had to build a portrait. We knew, for example, from the flippant answers George Best had given over the preceding 15 years that he had a fractious relationship with Bobby Charlton but that film perfectly captured the unease between them. You could see from their body language that each was exasperated by the other.</p> <p>Similarly, the three great fly-on-the-wall films - on Taylor, Orient: Club for a Fiver and Premier Passions - gave such compelling glimpses of football man in the raw that it is hardly surprising that no one since has allowed the access that mercilessly exposed John Sitton and Peter Reid. There is still the odd jewel on BBC4 but nothing, sadly, as good as Hugh McIlvanney's Arena on Jock Stein, Sir Matt Busby and Bill Shankly from 10 years ago.</p> <p>Where once the BBC exploited the unique advantage of its archive, it now disperses it in butchered chunks on ESPN Classic and YouTube. We are better placed than we have ever been if all we want is action. But, if it chose to, the corporation could put together something as magisterial as Ken Burns's Baseball history. No one else has its resources, yet it seems to have abandoned the concept of the authored, in-depth sports film.</p> <p>Its staple now is shoving a narrow cast of talking heads on the screen and praying they'll be waspish about Coventry City's 70s brown kit. Where once there was analysis we now have clips and quips. The strand of nostalgia that was previously so successful seems as outmoded as the VCR itself. At a time when it is constantly looking for new revenue, however, the BBC is missing a trick.</p>",
  "<p>It was billed as the big-budget film that would bring hope and much-needed prosperity to one of Paris's most notoriously troubled suburbs. But shooting of Luc Besson's From Paris With Love, starring John Travolta, has been cancelled after 10 stunt cars were set alight during a night-time rampage. </p> <p>Several scenes of the \u20ac38.5m (\u00a330m) movie were due to be filmed in Les Bosquets de Montfermeil, a restive public housing estate in the north-east of the capital, which was one of the first areas to explode into violence during the riots of 2005. Following a string of arson attacks on Sunday night, however, Besson announced yesterday the project had been called off - possibly for good. </p> <p>\"We are deeply disappointed,\" said the local mayor, Xavier Lemoine, explaining that Besson's production company, EuropaCorp, had decided the risks to the crew and high-profile cast were too high. </p> <p>Almost a hundred residents of Les Bosquets, a part of the suburbs that remains blighted with poverty, unemployment and criminality, had been recruited either as extras or as security guards. Besson, whose company was to pay the employees \u20ac100 a day, has spoken of his desire to mine the untapped talent of the banlieue and try to draw the cultural spotlight to a part of the world usually overlooked.</p> <p>Moussba Harb, one of the recently hired extras, had taken a week off work for the filming, which had been due to start on Monday. The mother-of-four told Agence France-Presse she had been preparing a meal for 45 people since the weekend. \"It's a missed opportunity,\" she said. \"We wanted people to turn the page from the things that go on in Montfermeil.\"</p> <p>EuropaCorp said filming had been \"postponed\" but not yet \"abandoned\".</p>",
  "<p>Seven years ago, a mentor told me: \"If the young are not initiated into the tribe, they will burn down the village to feel its warmth.\" It struck a deep chord with me and bought up a lot of memories.</p> <p>As a teenager, I had a go at my own version of village-burning. This involved wrecking my community in a desperate search for belonging, and caught in the firing line were friendships, girlfriends, jobs, family and a few buildings. My desire to burn was born of a total dissatisfaction with my life, and my disillusion went beyond the standard teenage rebellion. I tried to destroy everything of value to me. </p> <p>There were very few adults in my life I could respect and trust enough to enforce the boundaries that would contain and guide me. Without knowing it, I was looking for initiation into a tribe I didn't know existed, and my quest for it began with no compass point or support. It quickly led to stays in police stations, young offender institutions and bail hostels. By the time I was 21, I was in a drug rehab, on bail, awaiting my first long-term prison sentence. Instead of the four years I was expecting, I got a suspended jail term. </p> <p>It was in treatment for my drug and alcohol addiction that I discovered the cathartic power of the written word. My brushes with crime and the law, and the healing I found through writing, eventually led a zigzag path back to prison - but this time as a creative writing tutor. </p> <p>For 20 years I have been a writer in residence, spending intense periods of time with prisoners, building trust, friendships, providing support and helping individuals create life-changing work. The problem is, our working relationship ends when the project funding ends. Intense connection, swiftly followed by a distinct lack of it, was what my early life experience was all about. </p> <p>Around 70% of prisoners reoffend and return to prison within two years. This percentage is even higher with young offenders. I could carry on working on long-term projects in prisons for the rest of my life, but the truth is that I want to get out of prison as much as they do. It was on my last visit to HMP Parc in Wales, driving into the car park on another grey, piss-wet day, that I felt my heart sink. I knew I had to get out. I had done enough time inside.</p> <p><strong>It worked for me</strong></p> <p>Most of my life has been spent in rehabilitation outside prison - a free man. I have more experience of living in the world as a responsible, productive member of society than I do of serving time in prison as a criminal. And it's because of this that I've decided I will now best serve my tribe on the outside. I want to be there for prisoners when, I believe, they need the most support - after release.</p> <p>As a result, I've created a pre-release and post-release mentoring programme, Write to Freedom. This teaches the use of diary writing as a way of understanding and coping with what is happening to an individual in the build up to their release and beyond. It worked for me.</p> <p>Last month, we began our first Write to Freedom project at Ashfield young offender institution just outside Bristol. These young men are being supported in this new venture at every step, and when they get out there will be ongoing workshops and a monitored online community created for them to communicate, and post diaries, photos, audio and video files - a community that will support them in their rehabilitation. We intend to have reunion gatherings every three months, at which they can keep the human contact going. Our vision is to radically reduce reoffending and create new communities of support throughout the country.</p> <p>Stopping drugs, alcohol and crime was tough. My life since 1988 has got immeasurably better, but it has also got tougher. Life on life's terms, without drugs to numb the fear, is hugely challenging. To cope, I need a community around me that supports me, respects me and listens to me. In turn, I need to be part of the process of supporting my community.</p> <p>It took me a long time to return to my village and not want to burn it down out of fearful rage. Peace became possible when I actively sought out and listened to the mentors who had what I wanted: experience, patience and wisdom. The young men we are working with at Ashfield are hungry for this. They want to back up their resolutions for change with action. This can only be done if support is there when they are released, if they know where the support is, and if they are willing to ask for it. </p> <p>\u2022 Caspar Walsh's prison memoir, Criminal, published by Headline, is available in paperback from October 30 (<a href=\"http://www.casparwalsh.co.uk\">casparwalsh.co.uk</a>)</p>",
  "<p>Our schools curriculum is designed by the middle classes, delivered by them, and is successful primarily for the middle classes. I know that being middle class isn't automatically a passport to a loving, stable background, with parents who take an interest in your education, but it certainly helps. With a start like that, you're ready to learn - so here's your laptop, see you at university.</p> <p>Recent broadening of the curriculum (citizenship, recycling, cookery and the cadet corps) may aim to address the reality of children's lives, but it misses the point. Why not tackle something so fundamental that it is undermining many of our kids' ability to learn? I'm talking about mental and emotional health.</p> <p>Too many children live with a dysfunctionality that goes back generations. They might be living with poverty, unemployment, violence, drug use, acute emotional problems, varying degrees of neglect and abuse. Their problems are manifested through violent and inappropriate behaviour.</p> <p>At school, these children aren't mentally or emotionally ready for the academic learning designed for others. The curriculum races ahead of them, while their life sentence of labels begins. They are difficult, troublemakers, a problem. Then they're excluded, hoodies, yobs. There's an inevitability about the next label: criminal. However long their sentence, once they've got that label, the prejudices of others ensure they're really lifers by instalment. And maybe they'll add another label too: addict.</p> <p>We could have predicted it by spending time with them in their early years. Instead, we let the inevitable happen, then slapped labels on them. Our schools foster the academic achievements only accessible to kids from nurturing homes. How does this education measure up to the emotional needs of children from homes without nurture?</p> <p>If you're scared of hoodies on the street, or all those angry young people getting violently drunk in town centres, if you feel criminality is getting out of hand, remember that many of these are the people we excluded when they were just tiny children. So now they're excluding themselves. Incidentally, we probably excluded their parents, and maybe even their grandparents too.</p> <p>The result is that the number of people with missing emotional development is becoming a threat to our society. But it's not too late to tackle this massive task. There is good work going on - now we need to get it into the mainstream.</p> <p>First, we must stop offering academic goals some kids can never attain by conventional teaching. We need to recognise school is not just for academic achievement but for personal and emotional development. Teachers, please put aside political correctness and take seriously your responsibility to identify kids who have unaddressed needs. School - better, nursery school - is where the majority will be at any one time: this is the place to work with those needs. </p> <p>Then we should bring in the professionals - the psychologists, therapists, counsellors and people who understand this way of working. They should teach children how to nurture themselves and each other.</p> <p>In this kind of class, the kids are asked how they are today, and are helped to explore and identify their feelings. If a child is angry because his mum didn't give him breakfast, he needs to be able to say that in a closed, supportive peer group with a skilled facilitator. He needs to cope with his emotions honestly. The facilitators need to set clear boundaries that are lovingly and firmly defined. The development of every child should be supported.</p> <p>The explosion of violence in our youth does not have its roots in boredom or lack of discipline. It has its roots in emotional problems. It has nothing to do with GCSEs, training, jobs or activities, everything to do with a new definition of what schools should be doing.</p> <p>I was 29 before intensive therapy helped me address my unmet needs and to start living. The root of my recovery was learning how to value myself and others. If someone had taught me that when I was small, it would have cost society a lot less than the years of my criminal havoc did.</p> <p>\u2022 Mark Johnson is the author of Wasted, a memoir. <a href=\"http://www.mark-johnson.org.uk\">www.mark-johnson.org.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Barely three weeks ago he was a doomed loser. Now Gordon Brown is acknowledged in unlikely high places as putative saviour of the world's financial system. A banker with such a spectacularly upgraded credit rating would - not so long ago - have embarked on a reckless borrowing splurge. </p> <p>What will it do for Brown? Nothing enrages his political opponents more than the thought that the government's belated but sweeping financial rescue package may allow Brown to do what Margaret Thatcher managed in the Falklands war of 1982. She absolved her team's mistakes and failures which led to war, by burying them in a larger success - and blaming others. For Argentine generals, read American estate agents and Icelandic bankers. History gets written by the winners.</p> <p>A few Labour MPs are already muttering about exploiting the modest Brown Bounce, tentatively confirmed by post-rescue polling, to stage a \"safety first\" spring election in 2009. A few Tories think it might be his least worst option. It will not happen. </p> <p>Friend and foe alike know that the unavoidable recession will be impacting upon everyone's job and shopping habits by Christmas. Brown and Alistair Darling's experience card has edged them above the Cameron-Osborne team in some surveys. But the Tory lead is still in the 44%-32% range, squeezing the Liberal Democrats and giving David Cameron a solid Commons majority. A long slog looms.</p> <p>\"We're going to have to do the best we can, what else can we say?\" says one cautious Brown ally. Hardly a note of Falklands triumphalism, it is the sensible response at the start of what - on more optimistic scenarios - will be a grim year of rising unemployment, borrowing and (eventually) taxes, followed by slow recovery. Much depends on events beyond the prime minister's control. </p> <p>A gloomy scenario for recession would turn the Falklands analogy - a short, sharp, victorious war fought 8,000 miles away - into a cross between Iraq and Northern Ireland's Troubles: apparent success followed by a long period of low-intensity warfare.</p> <p>What the crisis has done is to give Brown a breathing space, and a chance to remind people what an experienced finance minister he is, admired even in Brussels. As an ex-cabinet colleague generously puts it: \"He's got his dignity back, but will it last?\" </p> <p>In other words, even if the Brown Dyno-Rod unblocks financial markets, the flattering summiteering will end, allowing No 10 to resume its hesitant course - unless the crisis has turned chrysalis Brown into a prime ministerial butterfly at last.</p> <p>In the blame game historical evidence points both ways. In 1982 Thatcher emerged as the Iron Lady, able to offset deep recession with patriotic tunes and a divided opposition. Elevated in 1940, Churchill was blamed in 1945 for pre-war errors (not his own) and thrown out. Chancellor Harold Macmillan was gung ho for invading Suez in 1956 until the Yanks torpedoed sterling. Emerging from the ruins as PM, he went on to win in 1959. </p> <p>Long-term odds must still be stacked against a Brown win in 2010. But fortune favours the bold and if the past week shows anything it is that luck can change.</p> <p>Next test: the Glenrothes byelection on November 6.</p>",
  "<p>So now we know. Aravind Adiga's The White Tiger has won this year's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/booker-prize\">Booker</a> prize.</p> <p>The (Man) Booker has been around long enough for at least 10 kinds of winner to have become recognisable types. Let's review them, and work where the 2008 laureate belongs.<br> 1. \"A Star is Born\" \u2013 eg Yann Martel or DBC Pierre. These shooting stars come from nowhere, and are overnight mega-bright.</p> <p>2. The literary \"Long Service Good Conduct\" medal - eg Iris Murdoch and Kingsley Amis. \"OK, The Old Devils and The Sea, The Sea wasn't their best work - but no one ever lost their job for ordering IBM and it's a safe choice\".</p> <p>3. \"Let's for God's sake have a book this year that people will really enjoy reading\" - eg Byatt's Possession, Farrell's The Siege of Krishnapur. This, sad to say, is the slimmest category in the Booker archive. It won't be swollen this year.</p> <p>4. \"This is the Britain's premier fiction prize, but let's show how 'post-British' we are\" - the last four prizes (including that for 2008) have been won by two Indians (one resident in Mumbai, one in New York) and two citizens of Eire (one resident in Dublin, the other in New York). Anyone for home cooking? Or is it hot dogs and vindaloo washed down with a pint of Guinness?</p> <p>5. \"Let's give him/her a prize before the poor old sod dies\" - eg Paul Scott (who did, unfortunately, snuff it before he could enjoy his victory) and William Golding (who won aged 70).</p> <p>6. \"Let's give it to a fucking good fucking novel that isn't afraid to use the word fuck\" - eg James Kelman. \"And fuck Anita Brookner's wimpery. We're a tough-guy panel\".</p> <p>7. \"Let's be masochistic and give it to a novelist who, we know, despises prizes and won't even turn up to collect it\" - eg JM Coetzee.</p> <p>8. \"Let's give it to the novelist who should have won it for his last novel - even though this one ain't so hot\" - eg Ian McEwan and Amsterdam.</p> <p>9. \"We're out of our minds - lock us up before we do more damage to Literature\" - eg \"G\" and (forgive me New Zealand) The Bone People.</p> <p>10. \"Jesus Christ, we're in luck. This is a masterpiece!\" - Midnight's Children (triple Booker winner), In a Free State.<br> One could go on. The wonder is that, whatever the spin, the Man Booker invariably comes up with a novel which makes us think about what good fiction is.</p> <p>In which of the above categories does The White Tiger belong? Clearly there's an element of shooting star. For most of us Aravind Adiga was an unknown quantity before 2008. Clearly, too, his novel is what I've called \"post-British\". And it confirms a widening ripple in the Booker's sense of what the novel, as a genre, should do.</p> <p>Thirty years ago, I believe, Philip Hensher's introvertedly English Sheffield saga, The Northern Clemency, would have won hands down. Twenty years ago, I think some beloved old soldier (Beryl Bainbridge, for example, or John Le Carr\u00e9) would have been in with a strong chance. And if, as Louise Doughty has told us, \"readability\" should be the sole criterion, why not Alan Bennett's The Uncommon Reader? That, alas, would be a wholly new category of uncommonly readable winner.</p>",
  "<p>The details of Apple's announcements today are <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/oct/14/apple-apple\">already written up by Bobbie</a>. But to me what was interesting about the event was its subtext - the stuff that wasn't said, but which is just as important, and potentially more interesting.</p> <p>First, even before the event was the invitation itself. \"The spotlight turns to notebooks\", said Apple - showing its hand in a way that I cannot ever remember it doing before. It's always been vague - \"Let's Rock\", \"Showtime\", \"a music event\" - rather than so specific. Why do that? Perhaps it's news management: Apple's realised that if it's too vague, speculation spins off into the stratosphere, and that can actually harm the share price as short buyers ramp it up and down - buy on the rumour, sell on the fact, as the City saying goes.</p> <p>Second was the amount of detail that emerged before the event. <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2008/10/13/mr-blurrycam-reveals-the-updated-macbook-pro-899-laptop-model/\">Engadget</a> and the rumours sites had <a href=\"http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/08/10/11/apple_dumping_intel_chipsets_for_nvidias_in_new_macbooks.html\">pretty</a> <a href=\"http://www.powerpage.org/2008/10/potential_nextgen_macbook_shots_leaked_lower_price_point_mentioned.html\">much</a> <a href=\"http://www.macrumors.com/2008/10/12/higher-quality-macbook-pro-case-photos/\">every</a> <a href=\"http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/08/10/09/sources_latest_macbook_pro_photo_is_the_real_deal.html\">detail</a> of the new machines nailed; <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/2008/10/contains_spoilers\">John Gruber's post</a> was written with the authority of someone who had been told by someone whom he trusted to know.</p> <p>How does so much detail get out?

The process was good for secrecy, but bad for sales. By moving product through the channel faster, Apple risks more information leaks.</p> </blockquote> <p>Next, the event itself. Steve Jobs made a point of handing over large chunks of the introduction to Tim Cook, the ex-Compaq VP who is chief operating officer, who took over from Jobs in summer 2004 while he was recovering from surgery for a rare form of pancreatic cancer (the sort that has a very high post-diagnostic survival rate). And Jonathan Ive also appeared on stage - the first time I can remember - to talk about the designs. </p> <p>Subtext? It certainly feels like Jobs getting new people inculcated into the idea of making big, important presentations - even if this wasn't in the grand scheme of things. (In September 2004, with Jobs ill, marketing veep Phil Schiller - not Cook - presented to the MacExpo show in Paris, which introduced the new flatscreen iMac shape. He was funny and very competent; interesting that he wasn't called on to present this time. Already skilled up?)</p> <p>Next is the bombshell on Blu-ray. This just isn't there, and even though Apple has been a member of the Blu-ray consortium since, well, forever, and even though Blu-ray won its battle with HD DVD way back in January, it simply isn't shifting. \"Blu-ray is just a bag of hurt,\" Jobs told journalists. \"It's great to watch the movies, but the licensing of the tech is so complex, we're waiting till things settle down and Blu-ray takes off in the marketplace.\"</p> <p>I think that's going to guarantee that Blu-ray doesn't take off in the computer marketplace any time soon. Remember, Apple really can and does drive the adoption of such technologies: it got USB adopted by using it on the first iMac (and abandoning its own connectors); it got Bluetooth and Wi-Fi working early; it pushed DVD-reading drives hard (mistakenly, as it happened; in 2000 everyone actually wanted CD burners so they could play their Napster collections. Er, I mean, make important data backups.)</p> <p>And speaking of abandoning Apple connectors, and USB: the new MacBooks lack FireWire, Apple's high-speed peer-to-peer data transfer technology. Instead they've got USB2. This probably cuts costs, and is also a tacit acknowledgement by Apple that it lost that battle with Intel. Even so, it's a loss: FireWire is faster than USB2, and uses less CPU. Apple didn't mention this either.</p> <p>What about that economy, then? Jobs and co couldn't talk about financial matters or the economy - it's close to the financial announcements for the past quarter - but the US is not a place where you can run around on cheap credit any more. Fuel and food are more expensive, and houses aren't; that's a combination for a downturn. So Apple's solidifying its positioning, pulling its branding around it. But here's the thing: that means keeping its position as a premium brand, nor pulling in customers by taking a margin cut.</p> <p>That's evidence by the fact that starting prices aren't lower - despite the expectations that had been around of a $900 or even $800 MacBook. In fact, they're up: third-party developer Fraser Speirs <a href=\"https://twitter.com/fraserspeirs/statuses/959526730\">noted</a>: \"The UK entry level price point on MacBook has gone up from \u00a3699 to \u00a3949. Keeping last-gen model around for \u00a3719 is bogus.\" That is, you can buy the old \"white\" MacBook for the low price (though even that has gone up from \u00a3699, as Jupiter analyst Ian Fogg <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ianfogg42/statuses/959425589\">spotted</a>, which has a very slightly faster processor: 2.1GHz rather than 2.0GHz). But for the new models of MacBook, you're talking about \u00a3949. </p> <p>What credit crunch? Huh? Nationalised the banks? Never heard of it.</p> <p>But another sign of that careful approach to money: Apple is still paring away at the free stuff, as Michael Tsai <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mjtsai/statuses/959457836\">noticed</a>: \"Apple Remote no longer included. Dual-Link DVI Adapter $99 extra.\"</p> <p>Joe Wilcox was <a href=\"http://blogs.eweek.com/applewatch/content/macbook/what_apples_new_notebooks_must_be.html\">singularly unimpressed</a>: </p> <blockquote> <p>I'm not picking on Apple but making a point. The rumors \u2014 all that free marketing for Apple \u2014 make much ado about nothing. Feature-for-feature, Apple notebooks have fallen way behind their Windows counterparts, as so I rudely blogged back in August. But the buzz is great marketing.</p> </blockquote> <p>But, he added, Apple shouldn't venture into the sub-$1,000 (in the UK, it would be about \u00a3650) market: </p> <blockquote> <p>Apple's branding means something. The company shoudn't risk its premium notebook brands tomorrow with cutthroat pricing. If there is a sub-$1,000 laptop, Apple should differentiate by something, such as new subbranding, lesser configuration or design appeal. Apple should keep the premium brands above $1,000.</p> </blockquote> <p>So let's sum up all the subtexts. Apple can't control how the news about its products gets out so well. It's getting us used to people other than Jobs presenting. It's drawing itself up to its premium position in the market, rather than trying to reach down, even though there's possibly more desire for its computers than ever before.</p> <p>Man, they must think it's going to be <em>awful</em> next year. Can't wait for the finance call.</p>",
  "<p>Not long after I took office as Mexico's foreign minister in 2001, a novel problem came across my desk. An Argentine naval officer who had resettled in Mexico under an assumed name was wanted by Spain on charges of genocide, torture, and terrorism. The officer, <a href=\"http://asiapacific.amnesty.org/library/index/ENGAMR410042001?open&amp;of=ENG-MEX\">Ricardo Miguel Cavallo</a>, was implicated in abuses committed in 1977 and 1978 at the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirty_War\">notorious Naval Mechanics School</a> in Buenos Aires. According to the Spanish indictment, Cavallo belonged to the operations unit of a group actively involved in kidnapping and torturing people whom the military regime perceived as leftist.</p> <p>The question before me was whether to extradite Cavallo to Spain, a third country, to face trial for human rights abuses committed in Argentina. Signing the papers would be groundbreaking, as it would signal for the first time that suspected rights abusers might face trial anywhere in the world if justice was not likely at home. </p> <p>For me, the decision was straightforward: the crimes demanded justice, and Cavallo was more likely to be held to account in Spain than in Argentina. Amnesty laws in Argentina at the time shielded him from prosecution. I signed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/jul/19/argentina.theeditorpressreview\">the extradition papers</a>. </p> <p>Since then, many inroads have been made to ensure that the world's most serious crimes no longer go unpunished. The international criminal court is up and running, and 107 states, including Mexico, have ratified the treaty establishing the court and acceded to its jurisdiction. </p> <p>National courts, such as those in Spain, play an increasingly strong role in combating impunity through the exercise of universal jurisdiction. The rise of these types of prosecutions has in turn motivated countries, including Argentina and Chile, to repeal their amnesty laws so that suspected war criminals can be prosecuted at home. The trials of <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/europe/2001/yugoslavia_after_milosevic/\">Slobodan Milosevic</a> and <a href=\"http://charlestaylortrial.org/\">Charles Taylor</a> have demonstrated that even heads of state are no longer safe from prosecution. The comfort level for perpetrators of these crimes is shrinking as the options for prosecution expand. </p> <p>Whether the progress in this battle against impunity continues or slides backwards is now in the hands of the United Nations security council. On July 14, the ICC prosecutor, Argentine lawyer Luis Moreno-Ocampo, announced that he was seeking an arrest warrant for Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir for orchestrating the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/29/sudan.warcrimes\">atrocities in Darfur</a>. Immediately after the announcement, Sudan's government and its allies began a diplomatic campaign aimed at securing a security council deferral of the investigations for 12 months. They are attracting wider support than they should \u2013 in part because of fear of retaliation against UN peacekeepers and humanitarian workers. </p> <p>But the security council must be extremely cautious in considering any suspension of ICC proceedings. Such a decision would be a serious setback to the movement to end impunity for the most serious crimes. It would show that indicted warlords and dictators can avoid justice by holding the security council hostage to threats of more violence. </p> <p>Suspending the ICC's work in this way would undermine its potential for deterrence, one of the purposes for which it was established. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/14/sudan.humanrights\">Postponing the case</a> against al-Bashir would seriously undercut the important principle \u2013 which has gradually been taking root worldwide \u2013 that no one is above the law. </p> <p>The security council's decision to refer the situation in Darfur to the ICC prosecutor in March 2005 was itself a major milestone in the battle against impunity. That decision demonstrated, for the first time, that there was an institution that could investigate and prosecute the most serious international crimes regardless of where they occur. </p> <p>Apart from being a victory for international justice, the referral was also a promise to victims of the horrific crimes in Darfur that the perpetrators of the crimes against them would one day be held accountable. For the security council to step back from that commitment would do more than abandon the victims in Darfur. It would be a major blow to those around the world who have struggled to put an end to impunity for perpetrators of humanity's most terrible crimes. </p> <p><em>Jorge G Casta\u00f1eda, former foreign minister of Mexico (2000-2003), is a global distinguished professor of politics and Latin American studies at New York University</em></p> <p>Copyright: <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org\">Project Syndicate</a>, 2008.</p>",
  "<p>For those of a certain generation, Nicaragua's Sandinista movement has a real resonance. The revolutionaries that overthrew the corrupt and brutal dictatorship of Anastasio Somoza in 1979 and then faced a campaign of destabilisation by the US-backed Contras through the 1980s deserved our solidarity \u2013 even if those \"sandalistas\" who went off to pick the country's coffee have now become objects of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Fallout-Guilty-Liberal-Lost-Innocence/dp/0224080776\">faint ridicule</a>.</p> <p>My father worked in Nicaragua for a while, as a consultant on an energy project, and came home inspired by some of the Sandinistas' social achievements, particularly its basic literacy campaign, but also with doubts about President Daniel Ortega's autocratic style and personal conduct. These were fully borne out by subsequent events. The Sandinista movement splintered, losing many of its original supporters. Free speech was suppressed and political opponents were detained without trial. The economy declined and new investment dried up \u2013 partly due to the war and a US blockade, but partly also due to self-inflicted wounds. Eventually a war-weary electorate turned to the opposition instead. </p> <p>After 16 years in the wilderness, Ortega won Nicaragua's election in 2006, but this time on a free-market liberal and socially conservative platform. He endorsed a ban on abortion, which appeased the Catholic church, and made a pact with conservative political parties. He has lashed out at his previous supporters, including leftwing writers, poets and artists, and violent attacks by pro-government supporters have been mounted on recent opposition rallies.</p> <p>The sweeping <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/14/humanrights-voluntarysector\">crackdown on NGOs</a>, including Oxfam, that has been mounted in recent weeks, needs to be seen in this context. National police raided the offices of two organisations at the weekend: the Centre for Media Investigations, known as Cinco, and the Autonomous Movement for Women. They broke down the doors of their offices and seized documents and computers. The organisations are among 16 groups being investigated for alleged money laundering. But <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/news/americas/story/723647.html\">critics</a> have called the investigations an attempt to silence dissent.</p> <p>Last month the government launched a campaign entitled \"Operation No More Lies\" which sought to rebut criticisms made by NGOs, which it accused of embezzlement, money-laundering and subversion. Their work in promoting human rights, gender equality and poverty reduction have been described by the government as \"modern-day trojan horses\" and a rightwing plot to <a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/48f2f34e2.html\">destabilise</a> the administration.</p> <p>The focus of the government's concern is the Centre of Media Investigations (Cinco) and its head, Carlos Fernando Chamorro, whose investigations into alleged corruption in Sandinista land deals are said to have infuriated the government. Chamorro is a high-profile journalist and son of a former president, Violeta Chamorro, who ousted Ortega in the elections held in 1990.</p> <p>The Sandinistas do have a legitimate grievance with the way in which the US government has interfered in their country's internal affairs through the external funding of domestic groups. They took a case against the US government to the international court of justice, which condemned the US for mining its ports and providing military and financial support to the Contras' campaign of terror. However, the government at the time gratefully accepted the help of several Scandinavian and European governments who supported projects by groups such as Oxfam and which are now preparing to cut this aid in response to Ortega's actions.</p> <p>As Oxfam's chief executive commented:</p> <blockquote> <p>For over 30 years we have respected Nicaraguan law, and carried out our work to overcome poverty and suffering in a transparent, accountable and non-partisan way.</p> </blockquote> <p>For those who instinctively recoil from criticising Ortega, either out of fuzzy nostalgia or a misplaced sense of solidarity, I will leave the last word to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gioconda_Belli\">Gioconda Belli</a> a former Sandinista revolutionary, one of Nicaragua's most renowned poets and a fellow Cif blogger, who has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/oct/25/giocondabelli\">condemned</a> the \"nefarious role of the US in the premature demise of our revolution\" and called for a renewal of her country through \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/nov/06/post578\">Sandinismo without Ortega</a>\".</p>",
  "<p>While most stock exchanges have been climbing in the last two days, after EU leaders' joint effort to save the crumbling banking system was announced on Sunday, the Icelandic stock exchange has almost completely collapsed. Since it reopened this morning it has <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601085&amp;sid=a6_D.jvgUmFA&amp;refer=europe\">fallen 77%</a>.</p> <p>This extraordinary fall is almost entirely due to the collapse of the three major banks last week. Glitnir, Landsbanki and Kaupthing amounted to more than half of the value of Iceland's stock exchange and they are now worth nothing. Apart from the three banks and closely related firms, most Icelandic companies are still standing.</p> <p>Iceland has few good options. The IMF is looking into our loan application and earlier today Icelandic representatives were warmly welcomed in the finance ministry in Moscow. Negotiations are reported to be well under way with the Russian government, which has offered a <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601085&amp;sid=a6cr3RnsK34I&amp;refer=europe\">$5.5bn loan</a> to the Icelandic government. This situation is not something that sits well with most Icelanders. The country has, since its independence in 1944, been committed to western cooperation, both as a founding member of Nato in 1949 and as an participant in the EU internal market after entering into the European Economic Area (EEA) in 1994. We are even fully a participating member in the EU border control scheme, Schengen. Our strongest allies have always been the Nordic states, the UK, the rest of western Europe and, for a while, America. There was a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_Air_Station_Keflavik\">US base</a> here until just two years ago.</p> <p>Iceland's self-image is tied to western Europe: we like to think of ourselves as the small Atlantic state that links Europe and the US. So it is a major psychological U-turn for most Icelanders to suddenly turn to the east for help \u2013 all the way to Moscow, of all places! Yes, we are worried. We obviously ask ourselves why the Kremlin is suddenly offering us help. Of course, we know the gesture is only a calculated strategic move in Russia's geopolitical game. But we are running out of time. Perhaps we use the word \"friend\" a bit too lightly when we discuss bilateral relationships. As Otto von Bismarck said, nations don't have friends, they have allies. So now it seems we have to rethink our strategies.</p> <p>And truth be told, we also need to face the fact that our own government is also to blame for getting us into this mess. Interest rates were kept much too high for much too long, encouraging a dangerous inflow of speculators' cash, and the failure to regulate the banks' operations abroad is a sign of utter incompetence on Iceland's part. Icesave's debt in the UK alone would be enough to pay the annual salary of every Icelander.</p> <p>The irony, however, is that the Russians are offering us an amount close to the sum we lost when Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling's actions prompted the shameful run on Kaupthing early last week. Kaupthing was by far Iceland's largest private firm before the British PM and his chancellor drove it into the ground. I see from a few of the comments that Guardian readers posted on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/13/iceland-banking\">my article</a> yesterday that there is still some misunderstanding about the whole horrible chain of events. The trouble started when two of the three major Icelandic banks had to be nationalised. The government of Iceland instantly said it would fulfill all its legal obligations regarding Icesave, but that it might need some help to do so, simply because the money was not immediately available.</p> <p>Then Darling found himself in trouble in an interview with John Humphrys during Radio 4's Today programme. It seems he saw no other way to escape Humphrys' questioning than by attacking Iceland. Then Brown killed off Kaupthing by invoking anti-terror laws. This did not only have devastating consequences for the whole Icelandic economy, but also for the hundreds of thousands of UK citizens who trusted Kaupthing with their savings.</p> <p>The bankers who got us into this mess are not loved here in Iceland. But we should still keep in mind that while Kaupthing had nothing to do with either Landsbanki or the Icesave accounts, the UK government did not hesitate to prompt a run on the bank. And that is why the Icelandic government is now forced to look to Russia to find help.</p>",
  "<p>A major terrorist plot is being investigated by the authorities, the counter-terrorism minister warned today. </p> <p>Lord West, the former head of the Royal Navy, warned of the plot during a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/lords\">House of Lords</a> debate on the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/terrorism\">counter-terrorism bill</a>. </p> <p>He told peers that one terrorist plot had been foiled, which had damaged <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/alqaida\">al-Qaida</a>. \"However, another great plot is building up again, which we are monitoring,\" he said. </p> <p>Despite anti-terror measures put in place over the past 15 months, Britain could not be considered safe, the minister said.</p> <p>\"The threat is huge. It dipped slightly and is now rising again within the context of 'severe'. There are large, complex plots.\" He gave no further details of the threat.</p> <p>His comments come a day after the Lords <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/13/terrorism-uksecurity1\">forced the government to abandon plans</a> to allow police to detain terrorism suspects without charge for up to 42 days. </p> <p>The home secretary, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/jacquismith\">Jacqui Smith</a>, dropped the measure from the counter-terrorism bill after it was defeated in the upper house by 191 votes. She <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/14/jacquismith-terrorism\">warned critics</a> they were exposing the country to a greater risk.</p> <p>Lord West repeated the home secretary's emergency statement last night, setting out her plans to keep the 42-day proposals in a separate piece of legislation to be introduced if needed in an emergency. </p> <p>He assured peers the government had plans in place in the event of a terrorist attack to protect water supplies, resilience, underground trains and communications. \"We have done all the things that we need to do, but the threat is building - the complex plots are building,\" the minister said. </p> <p>The threat level in the UK is assessed officially as \"severe\" - the second highest rating.</p>",
  "<p>The term \"game changing election\" has been bandied about with such frequency by the US punditry that it's almost a clich\u00e9 at the moment. But like most clich\u00e9s, it survives because there is a core of absolute truth to it that refuses to be dismissed. Both presidential campaigns are playing the game. Their approaches to it seem tied to the personal recreations preferred by the candidates: McCain, the designated maverick, is <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/28/us/politics/28gambling-web.html?hp\">playing a hand</a> of high-stakes poker and attempting an audacious bluff for all the marbles. That might be useful, if Obama were also playing poker \u2013 but he's not. Obama <a href=\"http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/multimedia/photo_gallery/0712/price.obama/content.1.html\">prefers basketball</a>.</p> <p>McCain's strategy to this point has been that of a good poker player, distracting attention from perceived weaknesses with bluster and misdirection while he builds his position. Of course, the cards in his hand are poor, so he cannot hope to win by calling his opponent's hand. The best he can hope for is for Obama to fold by making a devastating gaffe that turns the bulk of the US electorate against him.</p> <p>McCain seems to see politics as a series of hands: the primaries, the conventions, the debates, the television ads, the six-second soundbyte for the evening news. Choosing Sarah Palin for a running mate was a bold, high-stakes move. It's a one-man show (plus the hot babe standing next to him cooing flattering encouragement in his ear) and every hand adds something to the pot. Lose on one, try to make it up on the other, and hopefully at the end of the day you come out just enough ahead in the electoral college to take the pot. </p> <p>It's political brinksmanship at its most acute. When you seem desperately behind, you raise the stakes and change the game. It's a dangerous game, but you don't become a fighter pilot \u2013 however mediocre \u2013 without learning how to play poker. McCain has just the sort of devil-may-care, Top Gun mentality (with accompanying set of brass testes) to possibly pull off a bluff of this magnitude. Not many men have the nerves to do it. Poker is his game, and <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1819898-2,00.html\">he's a gambler</a>. It all comes down to that one last bluff, and whether Obama (or the other players at the table, the American people) will raise, call or fold. </p> <p>I actually don't know much about poker except what I pick up on cable, but since I live in one of the global hotspots for competitive collegiate basketball \u2013 between powerhouses <a href=\"http://www.goduke.com/SportSelect.dbml?SPID=1845&amp;SPSID=22724\">Duke</a> and <a href=\"http://tarheelblue.cstv.com/sports/m-baskbl/unc-m-baskbl-body.html\">UNC</a> \u2013 I know that game better. In basketball the strategy is far less about storming the basket manfully and making points \u2013 although that's the showy part. It's about having more points than your opponent when the buzzer sounds the end of the game. Obama's campaign understands that.</p> <p>Obama has fielded a wide-ranging zone defence, putting trusted, competent people in positions of responsibility, giving them enough direction to keep them actively supporting each other but enough freedom for them to improvise if the ball lands in their hands. He's kept the <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-money13-2008oct13,0,6436466.story\">constant resources flowing</a>, augmenting his substantial paid staff with hordes of <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/11/AR2008101102119.html\">enthusiastic volunteers</a>. He's running the court by making the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/13/us/politics/13caucus.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin\">Republican party compete in states</a> they never suspected that he'd be strong in. He's adeptly used competent proxies to attack his opponents, allowing him to appear above the fray, and he's kept the ball moving by maintaining focus on the most pressing issues of the campaign \u2013 the war and the economy \u2013 while dismissing the distractions.</p> <p>His surrogates aggressively guard him from the smears by going on the offensive, man-to-man. And they are prepared for everything. Hillary Clinton tempered the campaign for all of Obama's negatives during the Democratic primary. Now they immediately and aggressively counter.</p> <p>William Ayers? The Alaskan Independence Party. Tony Rezko? Keating Five. Earmarks? One trillion dollars in Republican deficit spending on the wars alone. The potential of higher taxes? The certainty of higher health insurance premiums. Didn't back the surge in Iraq? Didn't back the dumb war to begin with. Every argument has a counter, and the Obama campaign has a full arsenal of responses to these last-second misdirections because he understands the game.</p> <p>While all the attention is being paid to the star players of the team and the huge rallies and favourable poll numbers, the Obama campaign is counting far more on basic fundamentals of the game to win: the ground game, including Obama's heavily wired multi-state organisation, get-out-the-vote efforts, neighbour-to-neighbour initiatives and the historic voter-registration drives that have already permanently altered the electoral map. Basketball is a team sport, and Obama is relying heavily on his team to keep their opponents off his back while he drives for the score.</p> <p>In basketball the most important aspect of the game is the clock. At the end of the game there is a buzzer and then it's over. For the US, that buzzer is election day, and all the polls and rallies in the world don't matter if the buzzer sounds while you're still down a point or two.</p> <p>Obama will run the clock just like any good basketball coach would. When you're ahead and there's only two minutes left in the game, every shot counts, every possession counts and you can expect plenty of fouls by the frustrated opposition to try to break your rhythm and stop your momentum. You bring in your best players \u2013 <a href=\"http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gGn1Qiwx3uBAtrv66H46rHWSYoZQ\">Bill and Hillary Clinton</a>, Joe Biden and <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/10/09/michelle-obama-makes-idai_n_133232.html\">Michelle Obama</a> \u2013 and let them work out those fouls for you while you keep control of the ball and the initiative. And then you wait for the other team to throw that wild full-court shot right at the buzzer \u2013 for all the good it will do them.</p> <p>'Cause Obama got game.</p>",
  "<p>History seems to show that big crashes teach big lessons \u2013 and many of the new rules born out of panic and chaos remain both in law and common sense. So the humbling of <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10880718\">Wall Street</a> and the City of London has ended the idea that the market rules and financial capital is king. </p> <p>Instead the state has returned with a vengeance \u2013 nationalising and regulating its way back into the public's mind. Government is back in the US, Japan and the European Union and is busy attempting to stave off \"a meltdown\". Meanwhile the world is kept afloat by China and India.</p> <p>Neither Asian giant will be untouched by the crisis \u2013 and growth will slow in both countries. The <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/index.php\">International Monetary Fund</a> sees China growing at 9.3% this year, down from 11.9% last year. India will manage 7.%, off from 9.3%.</p> <p>Economic developments have political consequences. But they are not the ones you might expect. The question here is not about growth but about the model of government \u2013 what works best after the crash?</p> <p>India's government would like to take the credit for running the world's second fastest growing major economy over the last five years. It would also like electors to believe it had nothing to do with the \u00a3500bn that has evaporated from the country's stock markets since January.</p> <p>The fact is none of this is relevant to Indian democracy. Most governments in India are thrown out of office because voters do not believe they have done anything that deserves keeping them in.</p> <p>Paradoxically the lack of democracy in China has meant that performance is a necessity. Beijing's Communist party has to deliver public goods such as education and electricity to remain in power.</p> <p>India's democrats stay in office because the public had to vote for someone. When the polls arrive, 80% of the time Indian politicians are booted out. Little wonder communists in Beijing think elections are bourgeois diversions.</p> <p>India has built its economy without the tools of an autocratic state. The country has a legal opposition and channels for protest. But it has not had a revolutionary break with the past. There is no need for the elite to overthrow the Indian state because they benefit hugely from it. After all, why would they get rid of a social structure that maintains their privileges?</p> <p>Indian democracy appears a squabble for spoils rather than an urge to improve. What the west cannot see is that India's democracy is largely built around competition by different groups, who vie to control parts of the economy. They have a shared interest in making the economy grow but only to seize a larger chunk for themselves.</p> <p>That's why caste remains such a big issue \u2013 especially when government jobs and university places can be got on the basis of your ancestor's alleged persecution. India is also a rural, unindustrialised giant, so issues of class are a much smaller factor than in the west.</p> <p>This is kind of talk does not sit well with the western narrative that the development of individual reason led to capitalism and more individualistic societies. That's because it's wrong. The west got rich first and then got democratic. It was not a pretty process.</p> <p>Because the poor did not have rights, the transformation from agriculture to industry was a violent one. In England, peasants in the 18th century were simply thrown off the land. Parliamentary acts, pushed through by a landed upper class, cut down the amount of common pastureland. The result was to create a rootless labour force that fuelled the industrial revolution. China's modern-day version is just on a bigger, perhaps bloodier, scale.</p> <p>If India is to take advantage of its newfound economic might and create an industrial base for deploying mass production and employing its teeming millions, then it will need to reconcile politics with history. If India cannot industrialise, it will never be rich. But Indian democracy has shied away from the conflict that development brings \u2013 preferring talking to doing.</p> <p>Although no one wants violence, Indian democracy is failing to deliver the step change it needs and instead is planting the seeds of its own demise. The fate of the world's cheapest production car \u2013 the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tata_Nano\">Tata Nano</a> \u2013 is symbolic of problems inaction will bring.</p> <p>The administration of West Bengal could not manage to negotiate with a few thousands farmers for a 1,000 acre plot of land to build a factory for the Nano. Instead the car plant will now be in <a href=\"http://www.business-standard.com/india/storypage.php?autono=336735\">Gujarat</a> \u2013 boosting the profile of Narendra Modi, the rightwing Hindu leader of the state whose administration has been accused of orchestrating mobs to kill Muslims in 2002.</p> <p>Modi is a populist leader with a demagogic style. He is revered and feared. The US has twice refused him a visa on state department advice. Yet in taking up the Tata project he is seen as a man who gets things done when others cannot. Modi is a religious conservative who promises a reactionary revolution from above.</p> <p>Modi is also a clever politician, building a nationwide reputation as an economic reformer who has cracked down on corruption. He appears to recognise that the globe is at a turning point and portrays himself as seeking office by accident, swept into power by circumstance. If that were to happen India would regret it. So would the rest of the world.</p>",
  "<p>Check out <a href=\"http://mail.google.com/mail/?hl=en#inbox/11cfafff80742b09\">this editorial</a> from the Anchorage Daily News, Embarracuda's hometown paper:</p> <blockquote> <p>Sarah Palin's reaction to the Legislature's Troopergate report is an embarrassment to Alaskans and the nation.</p> <p>She claims the report \"vindicates\" her. She said that the investigation found \"no unlawful or unethical activity on my part.\"</p> <p>Her response is either astoundingly ignorant or downright Orwellian.</p> <p>Page 8, Finding Number One of the report says: \"I find that Governor Sarah Palin abused her power by violating Alaska Statute 39.52.110(a) of the Alaska Executive Branch Ethics Act.\"</p> <p>In plain English, she did something \"unlawful.\" She broke the state ethics law.</p> <p>Perhaps Gov. Palin has been too busy to actually read the Troopergate report. Perhaps she is relying on briefings from McCain campaign spinmeisters.</p> <p>That's the charitable interpretation.</p> <p>Because if she had actually read it, she couldn't claim \"vindication\" with a straight face.</p> </blockquote> <p>You see, in Washington, we're used to Republicans saying the grass is blue and the sky is green, and getting away with it because enough of them say it astounding conviction, and the media report it with a straight face. But they seem to have this old-fashioned idea in Alaska that the grass is green and the sky is blue.</p> <p>Makes one wonder how, if her ticket loses, her moment in the national spotlight will serve her once she returns home. Walter Monegan, whose firing led to the Troopergate affair, now <a href=\"http://www.adn.com/news/alaska/story/555288.html\">wants further investigation</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>Gov. Sarah Palin's former public safety commissioner says the governor smeared him and he wants a hearing to clear his name.</p> <p>Walt Monegan on Monday asked the state personnel board to allow him a chance to disprove the vice presidential nominee's assertion he was a \"rogue\" and insubordinate commissioner. The board is investigating Palin's July dismissal of Monegan.</p> <p>\"Governor Palin's public statements accusing Mr. Monegan of serious misconduct were untrue and they have stigmatized his good name, severely damaged -- and continue to damage -- his reputation, and impaired his ability to pursue future professional employment in law enforcement and related fields,\" said the hearing request filed by Monegan's lawyer, Jeff Feldman.</p> </blockquote> <p>We in Washington will largely quit paying attention, but that doesn't mean it will end.<br></p>",
  "<p>The Baltic Dry shipping index, which has been flashing amber signals about the world economy for the past couple of months, is telling us there is something going badly wrong because it is now stuck firmly on red.</p> <p>The index, a proxy for world trade flows, suffered its second biggest-ever fall yesterday, to 11%, which took it down under the $2,000 mark and it fell another 8% today to $1,809. The drop means it has fallen more than 80% since July's peak of around $12,000 and is now at a three-year low.</p> <p>The index has long been seen as a good leading indictor of future economic production levels because it charts the cost of freight movements in 26 of the world's biggest shipping lanes of \"dry\" materials, such as coal, iron ore and grain which feed into the production of finished goods some weeks or months ahead.</p> <p>Think back to the first part of the year and there was a boom in oil and commodities prices, which pushed up demand for the ships to carry them. Now we seem to be stuck in the bust phase. We know that oil and commodity prices have fallen sharply because demand has faded in the face of high prices and because the world economy is being deflated by the global financial crisis.</p> <p>There is some hope today that the worst of the financial crisis may be over, thanks to the mass injections of capital into banks by governments in Europe and the US. But the damage to the world economy is already a fact of life and the Baltic Dry is pointing to a further slowdown in both output and inflation in many of the world's economies.</p> <p>The index may also be telling us something scarier. It may be telling us that the world's great industrial powerhouse, China, could be in trouble and that its imports of raw materials are collapsing at a far greater pace than the slow slide in demand from the West for China's finished goods would imply.</p> <p>There have been increasing concerns about China this year. It has been booming for years and growing, if the official figures are to be believed, at more than 10% a year. That has, in turn, given rise to a stockmarket and housing market boom which now look to be going pop, as ours have done.<br>The great Asian miracle economy might now be coming apart at the seams, in spite of the official figures suggesting everything is stillfine. But the Chinese authorities cannot control the Baltic Dry.</p>",
  "<p>I was in Starbucks waiting for my doppio espresso when I spotted their new Glam Revolution CD. I nearly swooned with nostalgia. Mud. Slade. Sweet. The cat crept in. And then crept out again. The girl at the back said everyone attack and it turned into a ballroom blitz. Ballroom blitz. </p> <p>Before I could stop myself I was doing the Tiger Feet dance from Mud's legendary 1974 <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFHxPyUd-hc\">Top of the Pops</a> appearance in which they appeared flanked by real-life tough lads whose girly dancing embraced camp and married it to hetero-hardness in a manner unmatched until Sean Ryder's performance in Happy Mondays' 1989 video for Step On (\"Makes you forget you're a man\"). </p> <p>Then I picked up the CD and looked at the <a href=\"http://www.hearmusic.com/#PRODUCT396\">tracklist</a>.</p> <p>Goldfrapp? Adam and the Ants? <a href=\"http://www.mikafanclub.com/forums/showthread.php?p=1861841\">Mika?</a> Iggy Pop? 10cc? Queen? Placebo? This is <a href=\"http://forums.audioreview.com/showthread.php?t=28274\">profoundly wrong</a>. </p> <p>But it's not Starbucks' fault. They are Americans. And Americans don't get glam. Same as they don't get Noddy. This I know because last Friday I interviewed a gnome at the Good Faeries Ball in Philadelphia. I asked him: \"Are you like Noddy?\" He said: \"No, I'm like good.\" </p> <p>Neither Noddy the gnome nor Noddy Holder, lead singer of glam giants Slade, ever really made it across the Atlantic. Americans only got glam second hand via the posh Bowie version. They never experienced the true liberating glory of having the shit kicked out of you by Brut-reeking Neanderthals wearing eyeliner and rouge while the monstrosity that was the Chinn and Chapman hit machine blasted out of speakers in the background. </p> <p>In the UK, between the Beatles and punk, pop went totally gay. In a straight way. \"Brickies in drag\" and all that. The Glitter Band, Slade, Mud, the Rubettes, Suzy Quatro, Sweet, Alvin Stardust \u2013 a true gilded age of amphetamine bubblegum. And the Americans had Kiss. Who were fun. But they weren't glam. </p> <p>Which is why British punk sounded so much like the Bay City Rollers with the keys to the crazy drugs cupboard (years of listening to Wizzard and Showaddywaddy will do that to you). And it's why the US version of Life on Mars (the first show went out last week) has such a strangely denuded soundtrack. </p> <p>In 1973 (the year in which Life on Mars is set) the <a href=\"http://www.backdate.co.uk/1973_charts.htm\">Top 5 UK singles</a> included I Love You Love by Gary Glitter and the Glitter Band, Blockbuster by Sweet, and Wizzard's See My Baby Jive. </p> <p>But in the <a href=\"http://www.popculturemadness.com/Music/Pop-Modern/1973.html\">US charts</a> you have to scroll down to see Sweet's not-really-all-that-glam Little Willy at No 23 to realise this is the decade hetero-pop went totally testostero-tranny (with Elton and the Bowie in supporting roles). </p> <p>Which is kind of odd because a lot of the Brit glam-pop classics are now piped-muzak staples at US sporting events. Not the originals, mind, but covers by an anaemic yank hair-metal band called Quiet Riot. This is a huge gap in the American cultural psyche. It's like a culture not having any knowledge of Shakespeare, surrealism or post-modernism. And who knows how damaging this lack of glam has been?</p> <p>It probably explains why US hardcore punk was so macho, straight and boring. And why the US turned its back on gay metal (as we now know the Judas Priest S&amp;M version to have been) and stripped the genre of all its pomp, glamour and self-mocking silliness to give us the visually dull likes of Metallica. </p> <p>And it might even explain why George W Bush managed to win two elections (no country that experienced the full glory of glam has ever elected a chimpanzee as head of state \u2013 fact).</p> <p>A nation that has grown up not fully experiencing the glory that is Slade is a nation deprived. America is in desperate need of a glamming. </p> <p>The United States has changed drastically since the early 70s \u2013 and almost entirely for the better. It now has a thriving soccer culture and hundreds of breweries that produce more than drinkable beer. And a massive infusion of glitter-pop might be the missing ingredient needed to finally bring our beloved American cousins up to speed.</p> <p>Recently, I emailed a fortysomething American friend of mine a bunch of golden-age glam TOTP performances. He wept tears of joy, regret and gratitude. I suggest that every Brit should adopt a yank friend and send them a similar glam care package, bursting at the seams with the groovy tunes, pouting, archly raised eyebrows and awesomely bad dancing that had the most sexually repressed nation in Europe gender bending while it waited for punk to happen. </p> <p>Let's show them that we love them, show them that we really care.</p>",

  "<p>They've taken their time about it, the Royal Mail, but today they <a href=\"http://www.royalmail.com/portal/stamps/jump1?catId=32300674&amp;mediaId=82400737\">have launched</a> a series of stamps featuring women of distinction. That's after \u2013 so far this year \u2013 RAF uniforms, James Bond, working dogs and the House of Lancaster. I could go on, a lot, but you might lose the will to live. Philately is plainly a blokish interest.</p> <p>It's about 175 years since Queen Victoria's demure profile decorated the very first postage stamp, and nearly 50 years since Canada <a href=\"http://famouscanadianwomen.com/stamps/Stamps%20introduction%20page.htm\">first did a series</a> featuring \"women who've put their stamp on history\" (geddit?). The US has been there since 1893. (The first woman to appear on a US postage stamp, curiously for a republic, <a href=\"http://www.usps.com/cpim/ftp/pubs/pub512.pdf\">was of a Spanish queen (pdf)</a>, Queen Isabella, I suppose on the grounds that otherwise there would have been no US to issue stamps.)</p> <p>Maybe the Royal Mail was embarrassed by the choice. There have been, after all, so many women of distinction. It has dealt, partially, with that crisis by narrowing the field (dramatically) to women who have done something specific for other women, with the interesting exception of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudia_Jones\">Claudia Jones</a>, the 1950s civil rights activist who helped found the Notting Hill carnival, not a gender-specific event. This leaves the unhelpful impression that women earn their distinction through the sisterhood, and rules out a vast swathe of amazing women, writers and poets and painters and musicians and scientists. Perhaps it should have been differently defined: \"women working for women\" would have explained their choices more specifically.</p> <p>It's a pretty starry cast, all the same. <a href=\"http://www.mariestopes.org.uk/Resources/Dr_Marie_Stopes_materials.aspx\">Marie Stopes</a> (<a href=\"http://www.passionforlife.org.uk/more-news/1-latest-news/213-alton-stopes-is-no-woman-of-distinction\">provoking a storm of pro-life vilification</a>), <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/garrett_anderson_elizabeth.shtml\">Elizabeth Garrett Anderson</a> and her sister <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millicent_Fawcett\">Millicent Fawcett</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleanor_Rathbone\">Eleanor Rathbone</a> (particularly good choice, as, along with Claudia Jones, she is the least well-known). And <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/may/04/guardianobituaries.obituaries\">Barbara Castle</a>.</p> <p>How seriously chuffed Castle would have been to be so recognised, even if it is for the Equal Pay Act, an idea she came to late, and really endorsed less for its inherent justice than for its political purpose, which might unkindly be said to have been restoring her profile after the bruising experience of trying to introduce <a href=\"http://www.labourhistory.org.uk/?p=40\">trade union legislation</a>. None the less, she was undoubtedly a woman of distinction, who might equally have been honoured for introducing seat belts and the breathalyser, or indeed as the creator of the first Overseas Aid ministry. </p> <p>The kick in the teeth is the picture the Royal Mail has used. Definitely later Barbara, quite wrong for a woman who belonged to an age when looks were unashamedly and openly part of the political weaponry. How she would rage (I write as her official biographer) at the image of a woman with baggy eyes and a wrinkly smile. Just as well her hair is invisible. </p> <p>But, Castle aside, the omissions from the set are glaring: why Fawcett and not a Pankhurst? Maybe the Royal Mail still bears a grudge for all those torched post boxes. Did the Royal Mail Stamp Committee (no kidding) consider Thatcher, one wonders. Perhaps her signal failure to embrace any act deliberately intended to support women was a reason for excluding her, but no one could argue that she is not a woman of distinction. Could be, I suppose, that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/aug/02/harrietharman.margaretthatcher\">the \"state funeral\" row</a> made her a little too controversial. Or, since the Queen has to approve every new issue of stamps, did HM veto the prime minister whom, it's always been claimed, she couldn't stand? I think we should be told, but I know we won't be. </p> <p>The great question, though, is: who else should be there? The gloriously bonkers but brave and brilliant <a href=\"http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/Wbesant.htm\">Annie Besant</a>, theosophist and leader of the match girls' strike? Or <a href=\"http://www.cooponline.coop/about_facts_whowas.html#davies\">Margaret Llewellyn Davies</a> of the Women's Cooperative movement? Or the Chartist and anti-slavery campaigner <a href=\"http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/REpeaseE.htm\">Elizabeth Pease</a> ...

  "<p>The shooting dead of Jean Charles de Menezes was \"a tragedy\" that happened because police mistakenly identified him as one of the July 21 failed suicide bombers, a senior Scotland Yard officer said today.</p> <p>Chief Inspector Vince Esposito, who helped develop the force's tactics for dealing with suicide bombers, said he believed \"without a shadow of doubt\" at the time that the man later identified as De Menezes was Hussain Osman.</p> <p>\"The events that happened on that day for me, as a tactical adviser, boil down to one simple thing, and that is the misidentification,\" Esposito told the inquest into the Brazilian electrician's death, the first time he has given evidence about the case in public.</p> <p>\"It's as simple as that for me, sir, as the tactical adviser. It's a tragedy, sir.\"</p> <p>Esposito said he advised the officer leading the operation on July 23 2005, Cressida Dick, the deputy assistant commissioner, not to let police surveillance officers stop De Menezes after he got off a bus at a tube station but to wait until a firearms unit could intercept the 27-year-old.</p> <p>\"I advised her against SO12 (Special Branch) doing the interception,\" he said. \"My thought processes were, 'What are we asking those officers to do?' We were asking them to do an armed intervention in possibly the most difficult circumstances imaginable.\"</p> <p>Asked what the difference was between an intervention by surveillance police or specialist firearms officers, he replied: \"A world of difference.\"</p> <p>De Menezes, who was travelling to work, was shot repeatedly in the head by Met firearms officers as he boarded a train at Stockwell underground station in south London. </p> <p>He had been mistakenly identified as Osman, one of a group of attempted suicide bombers whose devices had failed to properly explode the day before on London's transport network. De Menezes was followed because he lived in a block of flats linked by police to Osman.</p> <p>Esposito said he became suspicious when De Menezes got off a bus at Brixton underground station and then reboarded the same vehicle. Brixton station was shut and the Brazilian travelled on to nearby Stockwell.</p> <p>\"If someone acts like, behaves like that - especially at the time - I started to form the opinion that he was Nettle Tip,\" he said, using the police code name for Osman. \"It was anti-surveillance. That was the opinion I formed in my mind.\"</p> <p>Esposito, who was working as an adviser alongside Dick in the Met's operation room, said the force had faced a \"really quite unprecedented\" challenge at the time.</p> <p>The inquest at Oval cricket ground, near Stockwell station, heard that Esposito was at the heart of efforts to develop the Met's anti-terrorism firearm tactics after the September 11 attacks on New York in 2001.</p> <p>These tactics, based on \"information we had gleaned from around the world to be brought back to aid our own understanding\", included the rule that a \"critical shot\" should only be fired if a suspect was identified and was carrying an explosive device, Esposito said.</p> <p>Officers were trained not to shoot suspected suicide attackers in the body in case this set off their bomb, he told the inquest. \"That was information we gleaned from other countries - that if a person is carrying a body-borne device then any rounds fired could detonate that device.\"</p> <p>Asked if he was \"shocked\" that De Menezes was shot nine times, Esposito replied: \"I am not because I do not know what they were facing at the time.

and move towards greater use of teacher assessment and American-style report cards for pupils.</p> <p>The shadow schools secretary, Michael Gove, said: \"Over the last seven years we have fallen behind as a country in every external measurement of educational performance so it is welcome that Ed Balls has recognised that change is necessary.</p> <p>\"We've argued for fewer national tests and more rigour and we want to work constructively to improve the assessment and qualifications regime.</p> <p>He said the Tories would argue for fewer and more rigorous tests, less bureaucracy and more freedom for professionals, and a commitment to excellence for all \u2013 underpinned with a special focus on the most disadvantaged.</p> <p>The Liberal Democrats schools spokesman, David Laws, said: \"The Sats tests taken by 14-year-olds are not only a waste of time but have been highly unreliable over the last few years.</p> <p>\"This U-turn needs to be just the first move in restoring confidence in standards in English education and putting the needs of young people first instead of the current system of factory farming our children.\"</p> <p>He called for an independent educational standards authority to sample pupil performance each year and the retention of KS2 testing to provide parents with \"real information about results\", focused on key skills children need to thrive in secondary school.</p> <p>Barry Sheerman, chairman of the Commons schools select committee, whose report called for urgent reform of the testing system, said: \"I hope that with the abolition of these tests, teachers will have greater freedom to focus on personalised learning, as well as be able to offer children access to a balanced education.</p> <p>He said he was delighted the government was considering sample testing of pupils, as recommended by the committee.</p> <p>\"It is also good news that the government will review the current system of KS1 tests.</p> <p>\"Given our concerns about the single level tests, I am also pleased that the Government has said that more evidence is needed on single level tests at KS2 before proceeding nationally.\"</p> <p>Ken Boston, chief executive of the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority welcomed the moves and said the decision to develop national sampling to check on pupil performance could provide a \"very useful check\" on how the system is doing.</p> <h2>'Sigh of relief' from teaching unions</h2> <p>Chris Keates, general secretary of the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers, said: \"The sound of a deep collective sigh of relief will emanate from secondary schools across the country at the announcement.\"</p> <p>But she warned that proposals to introduce a school report card would require careful thought.</p> <p>\"Get it right and it could help to streamline school information systems, rationalise complex reporting systems and reduce bureaucratic burdens on teachers.</p> <p>\"Get it wrong and the response from schools will be fierce.\"</p> <p>Dr Mary Bousted, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, said she was delighted with the moves.</p> <p>\"ATL has led the debate on testing, and has long called for a system that recognises teachers' expertise,\" she said.</p> <p>\"The challenge now will be to get teacher assessments right so they allow teachers to teach a wide curriculum, rather than merely become test administrators.\"</p> <p>Bousted urged the government to consign key stage 2 tests for 11-year-olds to the bin as well.</p> <p>\"We believe it is right to hold teachers and schools accountable for the education they provide, and these proposals should help achieve both high standards and a broader curriculum,\" she said.</p> <p>\"The jury is out on how the government will integrate pupil attainment, progression and wellbeing indicators into a single grade to replace the KS3 tests, and whether it will work.</p> <p>\"ATL will work with the government, through the social partnership, to make sure the new measures benefit pupils and teachers and do not lead to excessive workloads.</p> <p>\"We want to see the government learn from the mistakes of Sats to ensure data is both accurate and useful for parents and schools.</p> <p>She said helping pupils who struggle at KS3 would be a much better use of public money than testing them.</p> <p>Christine Blower, acting general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, welcomed the changes but called on Balls to suspend all primary school tests and commission a comprehensive and independent review of testing and assessment.</p> <p>Steve Munby, chief executive of the National College for School Leadership, said the moves would reduce the burden on heads, schools and students.</p> <p>\"This is a brave move from a government that is listening to headteachers, parents, and pupils. The NCSL has backed the idea of the balanced score card for a long time and is delighted to see it on the table now\u2026 we don't have to sacrifice creativity in order to ensure accountability and to continue to raise attainment in schools,\" he said.</p> <p>The Association of School and College Leaders' general secretary, Dr John Dunford, said: \"The proposals will make the testing regime more manageable and help to avoid a repetition of the chaos in summer 2008.</p> <p>\"This is not weakening secondary school accountability, but re-focusing on results at ages 16 and 18, which directly impact on students' future prospects. By concentrating on what is most important, the accountability system will be strengthened and more widely respected.\"</p> <p>He added that assessment at the end of KS3 would be part of the normal cycle of teacher assessment from 11 to 16. \"It will be for heads and teachers to decide on appropriate assessment arrangements and how to report progress to parents.\"<br> \"I strongly welcome the consultation on a balanced scorecard to replace league tables of examination results. Schools do much more than prepare students for exams and there will be the opportunity to reflect more strongly the overall performance of the school. This is a move towards the intelligent accountability that ASCL has been arguing for over the last five years.\" </p> <p>But he warned the indicators used to make up the scorecard system must be carefully considered in consultation with school leaders.</p> <p>\"A good school serving a challenging area must have as much chance of a high score as a good school serving a more affluent area.\"</p>",
  "<p>Ministers will drop proposals from the counter-terrorism bill allowing inquests to be held in private, the government announced today.</p> <p>The Ministry of Justice said it would remove from the bill the provisions that would allow the home secretary to give an order for an inquest to be held in private without a jury in exceptional circumstances.</p> <p>The proposed reforms will instead be introduced in the coroners and death certification bill, which is due to go through parliament next year.</p> <p>The plan is highly controversial and some peers believe the government was facing a defeat on this issue when that section of the counter-terrorism bill came up for debate in the Lords, probably next week. But government sources denied that that was the reason for the clauses being dropped.</p> <p>An MoJ spokesperson said: \"Both the House of Commons and the House of Lords have expressed a strong desire to debate the coroners' proposals within the context of wider coronial reform. We will therefore be removing the proposals from the counter-terrorism bill and bringing them forward again in legislation to reform the coroner system more widely.\"</p> <p>The government has already dropped the most prominent feature of the bill, the provision that would have allowed terrorist suspects to have been held without charge for up to 42 days, after peers rejected it by a majority of 191 votes last night.</p> <p>After the vote Jacqui Smith, the home secretary, told MPs that she would not seek to re-insert the 42-day provisions when the bill returned to the Commons. Instead, she said, she would reserve the right to bring another 42-day bill before parliament if a terrorist emergency made it necessary.</p> <p>The controversy over 42 days has overshadowed the concern about the inquest provisions in the bill, which were also strongly criticised when the legislation was being debated by MPs earlier this year.</p> <p>The home secretary would be able to order inquests to be held \"in private in the interests of national security\", \"in the interests of the relationship between the UK and another country\" or \"otherwise in the public interest\".</p> <p>MPs and peers have complained that this provision seemed to have been drawn up to prevent embarrassing information coming out at military inquests, such as the involvement of an ally such as the US in a friendly-fire incident resulting in the death of a British servicemen.</p> <p>Commenting on the proposal in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/13/terrorism-uksecurity\">the Guardian earlier this week, legal commentator Marcel Berlins</a> wrote: \"There are circumstances in which sensitive information ought not to be made public, but the government's plan is overkill, gives the home secretary too much power and greatly reduces the public's right to know the truth about suspicious and controversial deaths.\"</p> <p>The shadow home secretary, Dominic Grieve, said: \"We welcome this decision. The counter-terrorism bill was no place for debating this extremely controversial measure, which should be in the coroners bill. It is vital that the independence and transparency of the coroners system is maintained, not undermined.\"</p> <p>David Davis, who resigned as shadow home secretary to fight a byelection over his opposition to 42 days, said he welcomed this \"second retreat\" over the counter-terrorism bill.</p> <p>\"It was entirely inappropriate for secret inquests to be in the counter-terrorism bill, particularly given indications that the government were inclined to try and suppress embarrassing information rather than issues which were a matter of national security.\"</p>",
  "<p>The University and College Union (UCU) is facing a court threat if it doesn't retract its decision to encourage members to question the ethics of contacts with universities in Israel. </p> <p>A group of as yet anonymous litigants, who are UCU members, are demanding repayment of any union funds spent on carrying out a national conference resolution which asked academics to consider the moral and political implications of their links with Israeli institutions.</p> <p>Via their solicitors, Mishcon de Reya, the litigants warn UCU that they will sue its four trustees individually for recovery of the money. </p> <p>A year ago UCU accepted legal advice that its 2007 national conference motion for an academic boycott of Israel was unlawful and could not be implemented.</p> <p>At this year's conference in May, lecturers voted overwhelmingly to call on colleagues to \"consider the moral and political implications of educational links with Israeli institutions, and to discuss the occupation with individuals and institutions concerned, including Israeli colleagues with whom they are collaborating\".</p> <p>Their general secretary, Sally Hunt, had warned delegates before the debate that UCU would need to take legal advice on what steps it could take to carry out the motion. The motion sparked off a heated debate and a succession of resignations from UCU members.</p> <p>In a House of Lords debate, the former independent adjudicator for higher education, Baroness Deech, called on universities to derecognise the union.</p> <p>\"These efforts to boycott, or to come as close as possible to a boycott, are contrary to race relations legislation and ultra vires the powers of the union,\" Deech said. </p> <p>\"The UCU has created an atmosphere hostile to Jewish academics and to quality academic research and freedom in this country,\" Deech added.</p> <p>On September 26, Mishcon de Reya wrote to Hunt warning her that unless UCU accepted within 14 days that the latest conference resolution was \"ultra vires\" \u2013 beyond its powers \u2013 a group of unnamed members would take it to court.</p> <p>As UCU members, its clients were entitled to sue the union and its trustees \u2013 Professor Neil Macfarlane, Fawzi Ibrahim, Dr Dennis Wright and Paul Russell \u2013 to force it to declare the resolution null and void, the letter said.</p> <p>And they would sue the trustees for the repayment of any money spent on implementing the resolution.</p> <p>If legal action is taken, the union members taking it will be identified, their solicitors say.

  "<p>In the annals of show business, there have been a number of fraught relationships between famous fathers and less famous sons that had tragic consequences - the sons of John Barrymore, Bing Crosby and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/marlonbrando\">Marlon Brando</a> all suffered pitiful destinies - but there have been few as problematical and tempestuous as between Guillaume Depardieu, who has died of pneumonia aged 37, and G\u00e9rard, his celebrated actor father. Sadly, his death came at a time when he had emerged from the shadow cast by his father as a compelling actor in his own right.</p> <p>Both his parents being actors, Guillaume seemed destined to follow them into films. His first appearance on screen was at the age of three, playing G\u00e9rard's son in Claude Goretta's That Wonderful Crook (Pas Si M\u00e9chant Que \u00c7a, 1974), followed by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/77850/tous.les.matins.du.monde\">Tous les Matins du Monde</a> 17 years later. In this meticulous recreation of 17th-century French musical life, he was dashing and handsome (if a bit wooden) as the composer and viola da gamba virtuoso Marin Marais. G\u00e9rard appeared as the older Marais, looking back on his reckless youth.</p> <p>By the time Guillaume had made an impression in Tous les Matins du Monde, he had already served two jail sentences for theft and drug offences, including dealing in heroin, and had accepted money a few times for sex with men when he was broke. It was part of a rebellion against his father, whom he later accused of neglecting him as a child.</p> <p>After a few years of \"wasting my life\" with drink and drugs, Guillaume, with his characteristic long blond hair, co-starred in Pierre Salvadori's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/58656/apprentis\">Les Apprentis</a> (The Apprentices, 1995) in which he played a touching incompetent, and for which he won a C\u00e9sar award as most promising newcomer. Two months before the film's release he had a motorcycle accident believed to have been caused by a suitcase falling off a vehicle in front of him. While in hospital for surgery on his knee, he picked up a serious viral infection which weakened his right leg to such a degree that, after 17 operations, he had to have it amputated in 2003.</p> <p>He married the actor Elise Ventre, with whom he had a daughter, and tried to get his career together again. Improving all the time, he was well cast as a wealthy dilettante who becomes a tortured and starving writer in Leos Carax's wildly romantic <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/83326/pola.x\">Pola X</a> (1999) and was impressive in two further films directed by Salvadori: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/79432/comme.elle.respire\">Comme Elle Respire</a> (1998), as a petty crook who kidnaps a girl (Marie Trintignant, another child of a famous actor who died tragically), whom he thinks is rich, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/86496/marchands.de.sable\">Les Marchands de Sable</a> (The Sandmen, 2000), an effective film noir. </p> <p>In a television production of The Count of Monte Cristo (1998), Guillaume played Edmond Dantes as a young man. Because G\u00e9rard portrayed the hero as an older man, father and son (barely on speaking terms at the time) avoided playing any scenes together. A few years later, their awkward relationship was reflected (and exploited) in the preposterous melodrama Aime Ton P\u00e8re (released under the title of A Loving Father in 2002) in which both G\u00e9rard and Guillaume, as Nobel prize-winning novelist and estranged son respectively, seemed ill at ease. The film, which even involved a motorcycle accident, was the last feature in which they appeared together. </p> <p>In 2003, three months after having his leg amputated, Guillaume was given a nine-month suspended prison sentence and fined \u20ac9,000 for threatening a man with a gun in a bar in Trouville. (A few months ago, he was arrested again, this time for driving his scooter while intoxicated.) The incident seemed to alienate G\u00e9rard even further from his son. As he told Paris Match, \"He's a real poet who touches me enormously, but who is very difficult, incorrigible ... I cut things off because I no longer want to be the wall, or the trash bin where one dumps anything one wants. He has tried to contact me but I don't reply because I think that it's better for his mental health.\"</p> <p>A year later, Guillaume wrote in his \"as-told-to\" autobiography, Tout Donner (Giving Everything), \"G\u00e9rard Depardieu is a coward, a cheat and lazy\u2026 [he] is obsessed with the desire to be loved and the need for money ... I love him and I detest him for the same reasons ... For his impotence ... For his way of fleeing life, and fighting against it at the same time.\"</p> <p>Again he bravely picked up his career, being especially striking in Jacques Rivette's intellectually satisfying and subtly erotic <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/120935/don.t.touch.the.axe\">Don't Touch the Axe</a> (2007), in which the graceful interplay between Guillaume and Jeanne Balibar is a joy to behold. \"Thanks to Rivette,\" he said, \"I have begun to believe in cinema again.\" He also began to believe more in himself, working on several interesting films such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/121656/france\">La France</a> (2007) and De la Guerre (2008), and was shooting a film in Romania with the resonant title of L'Enfance d'Icare (The Childhood of Icarus), when he fell fatally ill.</p> <p>He is survived by his six-year-old daughter by his ex-wife and, of course, by his imposing father, with whom he was reconciled at last.</p> <p>\u2022 Guillaume Depardieu, actor, born April 7 1971; died October 13 2008 </p>",
  "<p>A proposal for a giant global fund to pay the owners of the world's forests not to cut them down has received a guarded welcome from environmental groups. They warn of the risks of giving rich nations a cheaper alternative to cutting their own greenhouse gas emissions and to the human rights of the tens of millions of people who live in or who depend on forests for their livelihoods. </p> <p>The independent report, revealed by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/14/greenpolitics-climatechange\">the Guardian</a>, was written for the prime minister, Gordon Brown, and states that an international carbon market could prevent the deforestation that is a major contributor to climate change and inject much needed funds into poor countries.</p> <p>The report calls for an international agreement to halve the carbon dioxide released through deforestation by 2020. It acknowledges this will be costly but estimates such action could be worth $3.7tr (\u00a32.1tr) to the world's nations in net benefits over the long term. If nothing is done to slow rampant deforestation, the report states, the resulting climate change will cause impacts costing governments nearly $1tr a year by 2100. </p> <p>The report was written by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_Eliasch\">Johan Eliasch</a>, a businessman appointed by Brown to be his special adviser on forests. Deforestation is responsible for at least 17% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and reducing it is seen as one of the quickest and cheapest ways of cutting emissions. </p> <p>The report recommends that forests be included in the emerging global carbon market. By giving standing trees a carbon value, it says, \"the cost of halving global carbon emissions could be reduced by up to 50% in 2030\". </p> <p>The Eliasch review acknowledges it could take at least five years before the global carbon market is operating and that not all countries would currently agree to such a system. </p> <p>It notes that countries that would benefit from international payments to protect their forests should be required to comply with international agreements that require them to respect human rights and to protect the environment. </p> <p>The countries that might benefit are some of the most politically volatile, and \u2013 in many cases \u2013 corrupt in the world. It says that in the short term the international community should pay up to $4bn to 40 forest countries to help them reach acceptable standards of governance. </p> <p>Environmentalists welcomed the report as a sign of deforestation being taken seriously by governments, and agree the issue must be tackled, but urge caution over how it is done. \"Sufficient and long-term funding is needed to act as an incentive to protect forests,\" said Emily Brickell, climate and forests officer for <a href=\"http://www.wwf.org.uk/\">WWF-UK</a>. </p> <p>But protecting the needs of people was also paramount, she said: \"More than one billion of the world's poorest people rely on forests for their livelihoods, so any measures to reduce emissions from deforestation must ensure that local communities enjoy continued access to, and benefits from, forest resources.\"</p> <p>Andy Tait, Greenpeace's head of biodiversity, expressed concern over the effect the plan would have on emissions in rich nations. \"If Gordon Brown accepts these proposals he will give a green light to companies to use forest protection abroad as a cheap alternative to making the dramatic cuts in the industrial and energy sectors that we need here in the UK. Allowing forests to become a get-out-of-jail-free card for the big polluters would be extremely bad news in the fight against climate change.\"</p> <p>The reliability of the carbon market is also a key factor, said Simon Counsell, director of the <a href=\"http://www.rainforestfoundationuk.org/\">Rainforest Foundation UK</a>: \"There is a serious danger of placing excessive hope in what might be very unreliable and speculative forest protection carbon credits. </p> <p>\"Avoided deforestation carbon credits might well turn out to be sub-prime, as weak tropical country governments fail to deliver actual reductions in deforestation, or as forests increasingly become susceptible to fire and disease because of the warming effects of climate change itself. Trading off our own emissions against hoped-for reductions in deforestation could be a catastrophic lose-lose strategy.\" </p> <p>According to <a href=\"http://www.foe.co.uk/\">Friends of the Earth</a>'s international climate campaigner Tom Picken, the plan does not address the deeper causes of deforestation: \"Financial packages are needed \u2013 but we must also address the underlying causes, such as biofuels, excessive meat consumption and industrial logging.\"</p> <p>Under the proposed scheme countries would be rewarded with carbon credits, which could be exchanged for cash on the global market, for not cutting down forests and for reforesting previously logged areas. While the international community would monitor forest loss via satellite, it would be left to national governments to decide how money earned would be distributed and what measures would be needed to prevent illegal logging. </p> <p>The review says countries could tackle deforestation in different ways. The most controversial would be to pay logging companies not to fell trees, or subsistence farmers not to clear land. In addition, countries could greatly increase their policing of forests or could tax heavily anyone who clears forest.</p> <p>But it accepts that halting deforestation will be difficult. \"Such delegation [of responsibility] will involve significant costs ... which may be very challenging for many forest nations in the short term. Demonstration activities to test these approaches will be needed.\" It accepts there are significant human rights and land-ownership risks.</p> <p>\"Risks include increased state and outside expert control over forests, support for anti-people conservation and land speculation\", says the report.</p>",

  "<p>Every 11- and 14-year-old in England takes national English, maths and science tests, commonly known as Sats, over five days in May. In the past 13 years, that one week in the summer term has fundamentally reshaped how schools teach.</p> <p>The tests are used to assess pupils' progress, inform parents of their child's achievements, feed into national league tables to show how individual schools are performing, and rate the progress of the education system overall. Government targets for improving children's basic skills are measured by Sats results. </p> <p>The problem, according to most of the educational establishment, is in using one set of tests to meet all these requirements. Tests should be an independent assessment of pupils' abilities, but if they also determine the reputation of schools via the league tables then that process becomes corrupted. </p> <p>Teachers, under pressure to ensure their school moves up the league tables, narrow their lessons and \"teach to the test\". Unions say this has radically changed the nature of schooling. Where once teachers elected to feed children's imaginations - particularly teenagers at the troublesome age of 14 \u2013 they are now forced to focus on what they know will come up in the tests. </p> <h2>Evidence</h2> <p>The Commons select committee described earlier this year how testing \"distorts\" children's education as they are drilled to pass exams to improve schools' positions in league tables. More worrying is the impact on children's emotional lives. A high-profile inquiry into primary education by Cambridge University academics found that Sats are contributing to \"pervasive anxiety\". </p> <h2>Reliability</h2> <p>Research suggests that initial improvements in results across England was probably down to schools getting better at tutoring pupils for their assessments, rather than a real improvement in skills. While Sats scores have pointed to an improvement in pupils' skills, international league tables suggest otherwise, with England moving down according to some measures. Furthermore, one study suggests that up to a third of Sats results may not be accurate. </p> <p>Headteachers point out that, while it is an immensely expensive system, they have little faith in the results. Most heads pay commercial fees to re-test pupils in their first year of secondary because they don't see the Sats results taken in the last year of primary as reliable. </p> <p>The tests have become something of a rod for the government's back as they repeatedly miss ambitious targets to improve results. For 14-year-olds, a decade of improvements have been followed by four years of stalled progress. </p> <h2>Delivery</h2> <p>This year's tests were disastrous. An American firm, ETS, brought in to modernise the tests, buckled under the enormous weight of marking and delivering 9.5m papers. Some schools still don't have their results five months later, while there has been a high rate of appeals against results. Some pupils have reportedly been moved to lower sets based on erroneous results. ETS's \u00a3156m contract was terminated, and the government is now under intense pressure to offer a new one-year contract for next year. </p> <h2>The future</h2> <p>A new form of test, called single-level tests, is being piloted in around 400 schools. They are based on music exams, which pupils enter when their teachers think they are ready. Pupils can take any tests at two points in the year, December and June. </p> <p>They are designed to be less stressful because the whole school year group won't sit them simultaneously. But teachers' unions have expressed concerns that they could lead to more anxiety, as pupils could conceivably end up sitting tests twice a year. And the results will still be fed into league tables, putting pressure on teachers to inflate results. </p> <p>Schools generally agree that it's important to test pupils at the end of primary school. Parents certainly want to know their child's level of educational achievement. And new parents need hard data as a basis on which to chose a school.</p> <p>But the tests for 14-year-olds are thought to be a waste of time, particularly by students.</p>",
  "<p>Syria and Lebanon are to establish diplomatic relations for the first time ever, putting ties between the neighbours on a more equal basis \u2014 and helping Damascus emerge from its regional isolation.</p> <p>Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian president, has issued a decree paving the way for the dispatch of an ambassador to Beirut, the official Sana news agency reported. Lebanon's foreign minister is due in Damascus tomorrow to agree a date.</p> <p>The two countries have not had normal diplomatic ties since they gained their independence from France over 60 years ago, with Syria seeing Lebanon as part of its historic territory. Damascus has been by far the dominant side in their relationship since 1976, when its \"peacekeeping\" troops intervened in Lebanon's civil war and retained firm control for nearly 30 years.</p> <p>The assassination of the former Lebanese prime minister Rafiq al-Hariri in 2005 \u2014 which was widely blamed on Syrian agents though denied by Damacsus \u2014 led to international pressure and street protests that forced Syria to withdraw its forces. Lebanon's anti-Syrian factions have also blamed Damascus for a series of attacks targeting its enemies.</p> <p>Lebanese politicians from the majority, western-backed March 14 camp welcomed the news but called on Syria to move swiftly to a final demarcation of the border between the two countries.</p> <p>\"It's a positive move and the start of a process of building healthy relations between our brotherly countries,\" said Walid Jumblatt, the Druze leader of the Progressive Socialist party, who has been bitterly hostile to Damascus in the past.</p> <p>Assad has been under pressure from the US and its allies over his close relations with Iran and support for the Lebanese Shia movement Hizbullah and the Islamists of Hamas in the Palestinian territories. Yesterday George Bush warned Syria to respect Lebanon's sovereignty and urged it to establish full diplomatic ties with Beirut.</p> <p>Tensions have risen in recent weeks after thousands of Syrian troops were deployed close to the Lebanese border, though Syria insisted they were only there to prevent smuggling.</p> <p>Some of the credit for the Syrian shift goes to Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, who reversed the policy of his predecessor, Jacques Chirac, and worked to coax Assad in from the cold. Sarkozy invited Assad to an EU summit in Paris and then visited Damascus. Between those two events Lebanon's new president, Michel Suleiman, went on a first ever state visit to Damascus and forged the agreement to establish formal relations.</p> <p>But Syria only went ahead after the formation of a new Lebanese coalition government that gave its Hizbullah ally and other pro-Syrian groups a big say in Lebanese decision-making.</p> <p>\"Whether this is a PR move or not Syria's recognition does now become a legal reality,\" said Timur Goksel, a former UN official and now lecturer at Beirut's American University. \"The fact that Lebanon is formally acknowledged is very significant. It's on paper. Assad has read the mood in Lebanon \u2014 that there can be no going back to the old days. And he's trying to look good internationally.\"</p> <p>Other analysts doubted how much difference the move would make. \"The Syrians are making concessions that look like they are complying with the demands of the international community,\" said Nadim Shehadi, a Middle East expert at London's Chatham House. \"It will make some difference but it's basically a PR exercise that will help the process of Syria's rehabilitation.\"</p> <p>The two countries signed a \"brotherhood\" agreement in 1991, which anti-Syrian Lebanese politicians say is skewed heavily in Syria's favour and implemented by a \"Syrian-Lebanese Higher Council Council\" that deals with bilateral issues.</p>",
  "<p>Crisis talks to break the deadlock in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/zimbabwe\">Zimbabwe</a>'s power-sharing agreement have begun ahead of the first session of the opposition-controlled parliament.</p> <p>The president, Robert Mugabe, and the opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, arrived at a hotel in Harare to meet with the former <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/southafrica\">South African</a> president <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/mbeki\">Thabo Mbeki</a>, who flew into the Zimbabwean capital late last night to mediate the talks.</p> <p>A spokesperson said Mbeki remained confident the deal could be rescued. \"We are convinced that we should be able in the end, no matter how long it takes, to reach a conclusion,\" he said.</p> <p>The agreement stalled after Mugabe unilaterally allocated key cabinet posts to members of the ruling Zanu-PF party, prompting Tsvangirai to threaten to pull out of negotiations.</p> <p>Tsvangirai said he would not join an administration in which Mugabe retained control of all major ministries. Without the opposition leader's participation there is little chance of a government being recognised outside Zimbabwe.</p> <p>Mugabe's moves have prompted widespread condemnation. The foreign secretary, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/davidmiliband\">David Miliband</a>, yesterday called for a united international response, saying: \"The results of the elections need to be respected and a power grab will not be respected.\" </p> <p>Miliband's views were echoed by fellow <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/eu\">EU</a> foreign ministers who said sanctions would not be lifted until the power-sharing deal was implemented. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/france\">French</a> foreign minister, Bernard Kouchner, said: \"We are worried about the situation ... and will certainly not abandon Mr Tsvangirai.\"</p> <p>Politicians in the opposition-dominated parliament today met for the first time since its official opening last month when Mugabe was jeered by opposition MPs. </p> <p>No details about the agenda were immediately available. The first sitting of a new session routinely starts with a debate on Mugabe's comments at the official opening.</p> <p>In March elections, the opposition narrowly won control of the 210-seat parliament for the first time since independence in 1980.</p>",
  "<p>It was billed as the big-budget <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film\">film</a> that would bring hope and prosperity to one of Paris's most notoriously troubled suburbs. But shooting of Luc Besson's From Paris with Love, starring John Travolta, has been cancelled after 10 stunt cars were set alight during a night-time rampage.</p> <p>Several scenes of the \u20ac40m movie were due to be filmed in Les Bosquets de Montfermeil, a restive social housing estate in the north-east of the capital which was one of the first areas to explode into violence during the riots of 2005. Following a string of arson attacks on Sunday night, however, Besson announced today that the project had been called off - possibly for good. </p> <p>\"We are deeply disappointed,\" said local mayor Xavier Lemoine, explaining Besson's production company Europacorp had decided the risks to the crew and high-profile cast were too great. \"I am sad for all the inhabitants who were to play their part in this production.\"</p> <p>Almost 100 residents of Les Bosquets, a bleak part of the suburbs which remains blighted with poverty, unemployment and criminality, had been recruited to take part in the film, either as extras or security guards. Besson, whose company was to pay the employees \u20ac100 a day, has spoken of his desire to mine the untapped talent of the banlieue and try to draw the cultural spotlight to a part of the world usually overlooked by big business.</p> <p>Moussba Harb, recently hired as an extra, had taken a week off work for the filming, which had been due to begin on Monday. The Senegalese mother of four told Agence France Presse she had been preparing a meal for 45 people since the weekend. \"Everyone is very disappointed. It's a missed opportunity,\" she said. \"We wanted people to turn the page from the things that go on in Montfermeil.\"</p> <p>A spokesman for Europacorp said filming had been \"postponed\" but not yet \"abandoned\". Police investigating the arson attacks said security guards had reported seeing someone apparently carrying petrol near where the cars were parked.</p>",
  "<p>Seven relatives of a 75-year-old widow have been arrested by police for standing by and watching while she burnt herself to death on her husband's funeral pyre.</p> <p>Lalmati Verma's three sons, their wives and her daughter were arrested for \"abetting the act\" earlier this week following the her death this weekend in Chechar, a village in Chattisgarh state in central India.</p> <p>\"Their mother had clearly announced her intention of jumping into her husband's funeral pyre, when her husband was still alive but very ill,\" said Amit Kumar, the local superintendent of police. \"These relatives failed to inform the police, or even other villagers, of her intention, and are thus guilty of abetment.\"</p> <p>The seven were arrested under the Prevention of Sati Act and face possible capital punishment or life in prison, Kumar said. Under the law, authorities can punish anyone who promises financial or spiritual benefits to a woman's family for committing sati.</p> <p>The law is punitive; anyone who is found guilty of standing aside as a woman throws herself onto a funeral pyre can be sentenced to life in prison.</p> <p>Police said that Lalmati's actions had been pre-planned. She had come for the funeral of her husband dressed in a bridal sari. Before killing herself, she made a couple of rounds of the pyre holding a coconut and a copy of a Hindu holy book.</p> <p>Bharat Ram, the eldest son, had earlier told reporters his mother's decision was her own. \"No one forced her or incited her to commit sati,\" the Hindustan Times newspaper quoted him as saying.</p> <p>The practice of sati, where a Hindu wife immolates herself on her husband's pyre, has been banned in India since 1829 and was considered by British officials as a medieval throwback. It originated with Hindu women who chose to kill themselves rather than be taken prisoner after their husbands fell on the field of battle.</p> <p>It is now rare but does occur in poor, rural areas where villagers revere the practice as the ultimate demonstration of female honor, devotion and piety.<br>Newspapers reported that a large number of villagers gathered at the site of Lalmati's sati and that verses from Hindu sacred texts were recited all night. </p> <p>A small sati temple already exists near the site in Chechar in memory of Jheek Bai, a woman of the same village who had committed sati nearly four decades ago.</p>",
  "<p>The government has struck a deal with doctors' leaders to reform the GP contract which MPs complained had led to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/oct/09/doctors.pay.gp.health.nhs\">\"eye-watering\" pay rises</a>, it was revealed today.</p> <p>The new deal with the British Medical Association (BMA) will see the minimum income practice guarantee (MPIG) phased out by April 2011. </p> <p>MPIG was introduced only four years ago, alongside bonus payments for GPs helping people with conditions like diabetes or asthma better look after themselves. </p> <p>It soon emerged most practices came close to achieving the maximum bonus points - and average GP pay rose above \u00a3100,000.</p> <p>The contract was also criticised for allowing GPs to stop offering out-of-hours care. The government has since reimposed a requirement for GPs <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/oct/14/nhs-health-gp-extended-hours\">to open for extended hours</a> and announced today half of all practices now do so.</p> <p>Under today's deal, for the first time, the amount GPs earn will be directly proportionate to the number of patients on their list and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/health\">health</a> needs of their local populations, the Department of Health said.</p> <p>Some of the quality and outcomes framework bonus points have been reallocated. So practices will now be rewarded for new areas, including making improvements in managing depression and improving drug treatment for people with heart failure. </p> <p>The prime minister, Gordon Brown, welcomed the deal. <br> \"Changes in the GP contract will mean improvements in the quality of care in your GP surgery, including the offer for everyone over 40 to get routine health check-ups on the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs\">NHS</a>,\" he said.</p> <p>\"When you put these improvements alongside dramatic falls in infection rates and some of the lowest ever waiting times since the NHS was established - I think we can see a picture of real improvement for millions of families who depend on NHS services.\" </p> <p>The news was announced on the day NHS Employers, which negotiates on behalf of the government, said pay rises for doctors and dentists should be limited to 2% in 2009. Although inflation today hit 5.2%, the employers said a balance had to be struck \"between fairness to staff and affordability\". </p> <p>That suggestion is to be reviewed by the doctors' pay review body and the BMA said it would be submitting its own evidence on what a fair reward would be later this week. </p> <p>Today health minister Ben Bradshaw praised the BMA's constructive approach to negotiations on the GP contract.</p> <p>\"I would not underestimate what this contributes to a peace settlement,\" he said. </p> <p>\"We are extremely pleased at the approach the BMA has taken and even a little surprised that we have got as far as we have.\" </p> <p>He said the new contract would help stop \"gentleman's agreements\", where GPs agreed not to take on patients that were already registered with another local GP. </p> <p>Dr Laurence Buckman, the chairman of the BMA's general practitioners committee, said: \"GPs and their patients will be relieved that all parties have reached an agreement. </p> <p>\"We hope this helps develop general practice funding in a way that recognises our most needy patients.\"</p>",
  "<p>As the government warned that 12 universities had \u00a377m in collapsed Icelandic banks, the new higher education minister, David Lammy, said universities would have to consider merging or becoming federations in the future.</p> <p>In his first address to university officials today at Universities UK's conference on the future size and shape of higher education, Lammy asked: \"Do you have the right number of institutions? In the commercial sector there would have to be many mergers over the next few decades \u2013 far more than we have seen in higher education. Could more be done to encourage that among universities?\"</p> <p>Lammy's remarks came just before universities secretary, John Denham, told parliament that \"no university is at risk as a result of its exposure to Icelandic banks\".</p> <p>Denham added: \"Clearly this is a serious matter for each of these universities, and officials from HM Treasury are engaging with them and the Higher Education Funding Council for England about their concerns,\" he said in a statement to parliament.</p> <p>\"However, it should be noted that Hefce has concluded that no university is at risk as a result of its exposure to Icelandic banks. </p> <p>\"Certainly no university faces a level of exposure that would raise questions about its continuing solvency.</p> <p>\"Students, businesses, charities and others may deal with universities with exactly the same level of confidence as before.\"</p> <p>Lammy told UUK delegates that it would be \"surprising\" if there were no changes to the current map of institutions over the next 10 to 15 years \u2013 \"not necessarily mergers but new forms of partnerships or federations\", he said.</p> <p>Lammy also talked about a \"greater specialisation\" of universities, which would mean \"choices about withdrawing from activities, choices which may be uncomfortable ones for those who have grown used to thinking about a traditional model of university\".</p> <p>Universities will need to reach out to more part-time students and adults in the workplace. That will pose challenges for universities and mean more provision off campus and new technologies, he said.</p> <p>\"The key challenge will be achieving diversification without diminishing the quality on which some of that success depends.\"</p> <p>\"There's no single shape for excellence in this country. Diversity of mission and approach is another of the great strengths of our universities,\" he added.</p> <p>Lammy said it was an \"important part of his job\" to raise the global reputation of universities and help them adapt to changing circumstances.</p> <p>\"You shouldn't expect the hail storm of initiatives from above you have at times, and understandably, complained about in the past,\" he said. \"I see universities as a powerful positive force for our society and I want to see them in the vanguard of that process.\"</p> <p>He added that universities needed to do more to get money from outside sources, such as alumni.</p> <p>Lammy went through Clearing to get a place to read law at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London because he had done \"much better\" in his exams than he thought he would.</p> <p>\"It's humbling and wonderful to be back here 20 years later as higher education minister, coming from a background like mine, raised by a single mother and the first in my family to go to university,\" he said.</p> <p>\"I know the freedom and perspectives education gives you, the huge opportunities to meet interesting people. I'm a product of that experience so I feel I know what higher education has done and is required to do for this country.\"</p> <p>Lammy said he picked up an appetite for learning and went on to become the first black Briton to go to Harvard Law School, from which he regularly receives letters asking for money.</p> <p>\"The government has promised \u00a3200m to leverage funding from voluntary giving. That gives you a great opportunity,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>Yes, I had money in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2008/oct/07/banks.savings\">IceSave</a>. And, as I search around to find someone to blame other than my own judgment, the Icelandic government and of course the global financial crisis, I can't help but think that their website had something to do with it. It's so slick, is the thing. The design is clean and clear, with the white spaces and rainbow-coloured single word logo so comfortingly reminiscent of everyone's online friend, Google. The site has fast response times and is laid out intuitively, with a helpful and extensive list of <a href=\"https://online.icesave.co.uk/OFIS/related/common.htm\">FAQs</a> and an easy to find Contact Us button which leads to <a href=\"http://www.icesave.co.uk/contact-us.html\">an actual telephone number</a>, rather than funnelling me to an online feedback system. Yes, IceSave's website is a model of customer-friendly design; it's a pity they don't have any money left.<br> It's rather embarrassing to realise that I was so swayed by site design. After all, I've been spotting online imposters, with the help of <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/\">Snopes</a>, for more than a decade now. <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/inboxer/nothing/billgate.asp\">Bill Gates will give money to charity</a> if I forward this email? Don't make me laugh. You need me to <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/fraud/phishing/phishing.asp\">update my pin</a> due to identity theft? Pull the other one. <br> Add to this that the web-savvy reader or consumer is constantly being told to withhold trust. We all know that the person we're talking to online might not actually look like the picture they've posted of themselves \u2013 even if their aim isn't <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_fraud#Dating_scams\">out and out fraud</a>. And <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2008/oct/01/scamsandfraud.consumeraffairs\">phishing scams are steadily increasing</a>. One really ought to know by now not to use online presence as a guide to trustworthiness.<br> I have more reason than most to know that all that glisters online certainly isn't gold. For nearly three years, I was lead writer on alternate reality game <a href=\"http://www.perplexcity.com/\">Perplex City</a>, an online narrative which tried <a href=\"http://wayback.perplexcitystories.com/?url=www.perplexcitysentinel.com&amp;season=1\">as hard as possible</a> to <a href=\"http://wayback.perplexcitystories.com/?url=www.perplexcityrail.com/index.php&amp;season=1\">look real</a>. We occasionally succeeded too well. For our wrap party, we wanted to order some M&amp;Ms printed with the logo of a drug we'd invented, <a href=\"http://wayback.perplexcitystories.com/?url=www.cognivia.com/products/ceretin/\">Ceretin, a \"cognitive enhancer\"</a>. We had a call back from Mars after we'd placed the order, though. M&amp;Ms have a rule that they won't custom print their chocolates with the name of any drug; having checked <a href=\"http://wayback.perplexcitystories.com/?url=www.cognivia.com&amp;season=1\">our entirely fictional pharmaceuticals website</a>, they'd concluded that Ceretin was a real product and thus on their banned list. On the internet, it's all too easy to look like something you're not.<br> So I suppose, although it's entirely irrational, I'll be shying away from financial institutions with beautiful websites for a while. I'm starting to notice a trend, actually. <a href=\"http://www.northernrock.co.uk/\">Northern Rock's site</a> is pretty attractive in a white-on-black <a href=\"http://blog.wired.com/gadgets/images/2008/01/15/img_9293.jpg\">Steve Jobs presentation way</a>. Kaupthing Edge, as well as having a name that sounds like a midtown NYC extreme sports shop, has a funky bubble effect going on in the <a href=\"http://www.kaupthingedge.co.uk/\">background of its site</a> rather reminiscent of <a href=\"http://www.o2.co.uk/business/sme/whyo2forbusiness/whyshouldyouchooseo2?cm_re=BusinessArea-_-SMEbox2-_-Whyo2ForBusiness\">O2</a>. IceSave's design makes other institutions like <a href=\"https://www.mybank.alliance-leicester.co.uk/index.asp?ct=mybankrhnlogin&amp;\">Alliance &amp; Leicester</a> or <a href=\"http://www.nationwide.co.uk/\">Nationwide</a> look clunky and old fashioned. But then, Alliance &amp; Leicester and Nationwide haven't gone bust. Perhaps, in this era of decreased trust all round, ugly website design is going to stage a resurgence.</p>",
  "<p>Politics actually works. That's the message from Liberty Central, in the aftermath of the long hard slog that was our <a href=\"http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/issues/2-terrorism/extension-of-pre-charge-detention/index.shtml\">Charge or Release</a> campaign and the government's sensible decision to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/13/terrorism-uksecurity1\">drop 42-day pre-charge detention</a> from its counter-terror bill. Our thanks go to Guardian readers and writers but also to those of almost every other daily newspaper in this country. The coalition of those willing to stand for the right of suspects to hear the charges against them before six weeks (or over 1,000 hours) of incarceration spanned democratic politics, civil society, trade union and religious groups, the literary community and human rights' campaigners around the globe. </p> <p>Ultimately however, this was a victory for human rights and common sense in the parliament chamber. From <a href=\"http://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/diane_abbott/hackney_north_and_stoke_newington\">Diane Abbott</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/frank_dobson/holborn_and_st_pancras\">Frank Dobson</a> on the left to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree+politics/daviddavis\">David Davis</a> and <a href=\"http://www.dominicgrieve.org.uk/\">Dominic Grieve</a> on the right, democratic politicians came together to say \"enough is enough\". Let the misnamed, misguided \"war on terror\" that replaced law and ethics with permanent exceptionalism be over. Let a new anti-terror effort begin, based on the values that bind our society together and distinguish it from those where tyranny and terrorism are rife. Make no mistake: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/14/terrorism-uksecurity1\">their lordships were glorious</a> \u2013 the cross-bench independents in particular. The home secretary's statement last night seemed to revive the discredited yah-boo of which party is really \"serious\" about public protection. Lord West knew better than to try such nonsense in the Upper House where any suggestion that the likes of Lady Manningham Buller or Lord Dear might be soft on terror would be met with the derision it deserves. </p> <p>To those who feel ambivalent about \"unelected peers\" trumping the \"will of the Commons\", let me offer two thoughts.</p> <p>First, all democracies survive because of the healthy tension between election and independence. Think of a piece of machinery that requires both fixed and moving parts to function. In other constitutions the senior judiciary sitting in a supreme court have the final word on matters of fundamental rights and powers to strike down unconstitutional legislation. Not so here, where even the much maligned Human Rights Act preserves the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty so that the ultimate sanction of our highest courts is only a polite request that parliament thinks again.</p> <p>Instead our arrangements bolster the independent limbs of the constitution by way of independent legislators in a reviewing chamber that can ultimately only delay abhorrent laws, not defeat them.</p> <p>Which brings me to my second point and the fiction that the government was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/13/terrorism-uksecurity\">defeated by the Lords alone</a>. Yes, the Lords defeated the measure \u2013 perfectly predictable if not on such grand scale. But what was to stop a government so dug in on this policy from going back to the Commons for some \"ping pong\", with the eventual threat of the Parliament Act? After all, Mr Blair got his pernicious control orders through by such brinkmanship. The truth is that notwithstanding the nine-vote triumph last summer, the argument was lost in the Commons as well. A number of Labour MPs who loyally bailed out the government last time would not have done so again and made this clear.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/creditcrunch\">dramatic events</a> of recent weeks have reminded the world that like lunch there is no such thing as an absolutely free market. Without a fair bit of law, ethics and regulation, the market will literally eat itself at devastating cost. Democracy is no different. It isn't a game in which the executive takes all at the expense of free speech, fair trials and other core values which we abandon at our peril. In the oldest unbroken democracy on Earth, parliamentarians finally remembered this and so politics worked.</p>",
  "<p>Maybe I'm just a sucker for making myself a hostage to fortune (after my <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2008/jun/09/applecompletelyarsesupthis\">woeful iPhone predictions)</a> but tonight's pre-announced Apple launch of new notebooks (the company's word) has some people in a sweat.</p> <p>They're expecting a <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/oct2008/tc2008106_898999.htm\">\"brick\" made of diecast aluminium</a>, carved by Goldfinger's lasers from a single block. They're expecting cheap Macbooks. They're expecting a <a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2008/10/13/mr-blurrycam-reveals-the-updated-macbook-pro-899-laptop-model/\">new MacBook Pro</a>. They've got photos of things. They've <a href=\"http://feeds.tuaw.com/~r/weblogsinc/tuaw/~3/420148268/\">seen the price list.</a></p> <p>As Kara Swisher comments at AllThingsD, it's \"<a href=\"http://kara.allthingsd.com/20081014/apple-apple-all-around-but-not-a-drop-of-thinking/\">Apple, Apple, all around, but not a drop of thinking</a>\".</p> <p>So here's my thinking.</p> <p>Making a cheaper notebook makes a lot of sense. The US economy is tanking (no matter what its stock market is doing; that's not an indicator of economic activity), so making stuff people can buy for cheaper is sensible. A notebook costing under $900 would be very smart ahead of what will be a constrained Christmas for many there. (In the UK, it might check in at around \u00a3500.)</p> <p>Don't expect a tablet. Don't expect an ultraportable (aka \"<a href=\"http://products.liliputing.com/\">liliputer</a>\"). Reasons: introducing a tablet would be commercial suicide: it's expensive, it's a niche market even for Windows (which Microsoft has been pushing, like water uphilll, for seven years now). And an ultraportable would have to be more expensive in a market that thrives on being low-cost; and anyway Apple already has its offering in \"light\", which is the MacBook Air. Plus, introducing either would mean a whole marketing effort - which Apple might prefer to keep for next January, and MacWorld, when it could also see how the economy is panning out (or down).</p> <p>Do: expect some tweaks to the products. <a href=\"http://daringfireball.net/2008/10/contains_spoilers\">John Gruber, who is typically right about these things, has some \"educated guesses\"</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>The new regular MacBooks look like 13-inch versions of the new MacBook Pro. Another single-piece all-aluminum chassis, the same black border around the display, and the same new no-button multi-touch trackpads. The displays are backlit LEDs, like the 15-inch Pros. (Engadget, which is reporting that the regular MacBooks aren't being revised, is wrong. They're not just being announced but should be shipping by the end of the week.)</p> </blockquote> <p>Interestingly, Gruber says that there won't be a low-priced MacBook. And recall that Apple did introduce the not-cheap iPod in October 2001, a month after the September 11 attacks in the US.</p> <p>And finally, if it comes up and you're not sure whether you should skip buying them..

  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> Brighton. <br> <strong>The lineup:</strong> Mike Lord (keyboards, vocals), Paul Steel (bass, vocals), Sandy Buglass (guitar, vocals), Stuart Provan (drums). <br> <strong>The background:</strong> Stars and Sons is/are the brainchild of Brighton boy wonder Mike Lord, who has given up promising careers as, variously, a refuse disposal coordinator (OK, binman), telesales drone and ice-cream vendor in an Essex zoo to make lush pop music on a budget in his bedroom. He named his group \u2013 featuring, on bass/vocals, early New Band of the Day maverick and fellow Brian Wilson nut <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/apr/04/popandrock1\">Paul Steel</a> \u2013 after a song by latterday baroque popsters Broken Social Scene. Not surprisingly, Stars and Sons sound a bit like that Canadian collective, with their chaotic swirl of influences that includes everything from the dream-pop of My Bloody Valentine to the piano-pop of Ben Folds Five and the Technicolor extravaganzas of Flaming Lips, only, of course, without the major label backing. <br> After the recent commercial failure of Jack McManus and Julian Velard we're less than confident that this brand of Andrew Lloyd Webber-goes-pop has any appeal in the wider world. But we're not going to assess its chances of achieving success; instead we're going to applaud Lord's ambition. We're not market analysts, we're pop fans. It's Good for Me has some of the camp grandeur of Mika, who now that we think about it didn't do too badly, thank you very much, with this sort of rocked-up music for musicals. He even refers to \"my loyal subjects\" at one point with the haughty glee of Freddie Mercury before describing himself, unless we're hearing things, as \"Julian Cope on caffeine\". When he starts warbling in his distinctive falsetto about levitating cars and medicating his troubles and strife on the busy, bustling low-rent Queen-rock of Future Proof \u2013 you can just imagine the glockenspiels, tubular bells, trumpets and choirs \u2013 we start to cheer. And that's without mentioning the hand-painted sleeve that debut single In the Ocean arrives in \u2013 all splotchy and blotchy, 500 of them were hand-finished using kids' poster paints, and if you sniff it, your whole childhood will come flooding back in a Proustian rush. Or not. The band appear to have got high on the paint fumes, because accompanying the single is a trippy but actually mightily impressive DIY promo, filmed using Lord's dad's video camera. A veritable Michel Gondry-on-a-shoestring freak-fest, it includes an underwater dance scene with a girl wearing a Scarlett Johansson mask and climaxes with Lord being tossed from a wardrobe into the sea. Lucky he was just inhaling paint.  <strong>The buzz:</strong> \"Camper than a row of tents at a gay holiday village where the redcoats wear pink coats.\"<br> <strong>The truth:</strong> We thought Mika's success would have opened the door for legions of glam-popsters, but sadly not, which doesn't augur well for the enterprising Lord. <br> <strong>Most likely to:</strong> Attract a small number of loyal subjects. <br> <strong>Least likely to:</strong> Dance underwater with Scarlett Johansson. <br> <strong>What to buy:</strong> In the Ocean is released by Alcopop on November 17. <br> <strong>File next to:</strong> Ben Folds, Eels, Flaming Lips, Queen. <br> <strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/starsandsonsuk\">www.myspace.com/starsandsonsuk</a>. <br> <strong>Tomorrow's new band:</strong> Women.</p>",
  "<p>When I was in Alaska last month, several people told me they were afraid to speak about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/sarahpalin\">Sarah Palin</a> on the record, lest they invite retaliation from the governor's office or, God forbid, from the next vice-president. At the time, I didn't take such worries too seriously. As abominable a candidate as Palin is, it was hard for me to imagine vice-presidential staffers trying ruin the lives of private Wasilla citizens just because they had displeased her. But reading the official report of the investigation into the Palin abuse-of-power scandal known as <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/11/us/politics/11trooper.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1&amp;ref=todayspaper\">Troopergate</a>, it seems that perhaps her critics were being more prudent than paranoid.</p> <p>As scandals go, Troopergate is absurdly picayune. According to the report, released Friday by the bipartisan legislative council that authorised the investigation, Palin and her husband <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/10/us/10trooper.html?ref=politics\">tried to use their political power to have her sister's ex-husband, state trooper Michael Wooten, fired from his job</a> and investigated for workers compensation fraud. They also pressed authorities to prosecute him for a moose shooting that was unlawful because of a technicality (the permit had been issued to his then-wife, who was with him at the time, rather than to Wooten, who pulled the trigger). The governor then fired Walt Monegan, the public safety commissioner, because he refused to get rid of Wooten, something he could not legally have done. This stuff is so ridiculously small it seems silly to even be writing about it, especially at time of multiplying global emergencies. </p> <p>Yet given that there is still a chance - albeit a diminishing one - that Palin could soon be in a position of national political power, it's worth looking at how she has exercised power in the past. As a window into how Palin might rule, Troopergate's very pettiness is what makes it so troubling. We're used to politicians who do favours for campaign contributors, who are too cozy with lobbyists and who resort to underhanded tactics against political foes. What we are not used to are politicians who use their offices to intervene in family quarrels and punish their relatives' personal enemies. For the last eight years, we've suffered under an administration that sees no difference between politics and governing. Palin is something arguably worse, a person who sees no difference between her private life and her public duties. Even Dick Cheney, after all, hasn't used his office to torment disfavoured former in-laws.</p> <p>Though Palin claims the report has exonerated her, that's an outright lie. It is true that it concluded that she was within her rights to fire Monegan, since the governor is allowed to replace department heads without cause. But it also found that Palin \"abused her power\" by violating the Alaska Executive Branch Ethics Act, which holds that any \"effort to benefit a personal or financial interest through official action\" is a violation of the public trust. </p> <p>More interesting than the report's conclusion, though, are its pitiful little details. There are endless haranguing phone calls to people throughout the bureaucracy demanding action against Wooten, even after the Palins are warned that their actions could get them in legal trouble. There are scenes of Todd Palin, who apparently spent a great deal of time working in no official capacity out of his wife's office, presenting Monegan with dirt on Wooten unearthed by a private investigator. We see Todd trying to bust his ex-brother-in- law for dropping his kids off at school and then at church in a patrol car (both times, it turns out Wooten had permission to use the vehicle for personal business). We learn that the judge presiding over Wooten's divorce from Palin's sister weighed the Palin family's vendetta against him in splitting up their assets, ruling that Wooten is likely to earn less in the future because his ex-wife's family \"have decided to take off with the guy's livelihood\".</p> <p>This is not, of course, the only case in which Palin has behaved like <a href=\"http://www.cwtv.com/shows/gossip-girl\">Gossip Girl</a>'s <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blair_Waldorf\">Blair Waldorf</a>, mobilising her minions against those who've fallen from her good graces. One of the people enlisted against Wooten was Palin's legislative director John Bitney, a friend of hers since junior high school. Bitney later <a href=\"http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/09/palin_fired_aide_who_dated_wif.php\">angered Palin by having an affair with Debbie Richter</a>, who at the time was separated from Todd Palin's best friend. He was summarily fired. (Debbie Richter <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122092043531812813.html?mod=googlenews_wsj\">has since become Debbie Bitney</a>).</p> <p>All this is, of course, pretty trivial stuff. But how terrifying to think of a vice-president - or a president - wielding the power of her office to settle such personal grudges. The Bush administration <a href=\"http://www.ronsuskind.com/newsite/articles/archives/000032.html\">has famously been described</a> as the reign of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayberry_Machiavelli\">Mayberry Machiavellis</a>. Palin promises something tawdrier still. Again, bad prime-time soap operas offer the best analogy. Could America survive the rule of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynasty_(TV_series)\">Mayberry Carringtons</a>?</p>",

  "<p>Still trailing in the polls, and with conservative commentators hammering his performance to date, John McCain adopted a radically different approach to his underdog status yesterday: he embraced it. In a speech in Virginia that had been billed as a \"reboot\" for his ailing campaign, the Republican contender sought to present himself as a plucky fighter, written off by Barack Obama and the \"national media\", but now ready for a comeback. For the time being, at least, McCain abandoned attacks on Obama's background, opting instead to warn of dark times ahead, and of the perils of electing a leader who would have to learn on the job. Sometimes, his fighting tone bordered on the implausible. \"We have to fight,\" he said. \"We have 22 days to go. We're six points down ... My friends, we've got them just where we want them.\" The speech was notably policy-free - but last night McCain aides insisted that had been the plan all along, and that the candidate will make major economic announcements in a separate speech today.</p> <p>Barack Obama, meanwhile, sought to consolidate and increase his poll lead with a $60bn economic rescue plan aimed at creating more jobs and easing the burden on the middle class, Ewen Macaskill writes in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/14/uselections2008-barackobama\">today's Guardian</a>. The measures, laid out in a speech in Ohio, include a programme of public infrastructure works that echoes the 1930s New Deal, and a three-month moratorium on home foreclosures. But in his warnings of hard times ahead, there were signs of the other challenge Obama now faces: as his victory seems more and more likely, he must somehow ready the electorate for the huge economic challenges of the near future, without corroding the enthusiasm on which his success so far has been built.</p> <h2>What to watch for</h2> <p>Obama remains in Ohio, McCain and Sarah Palin are in Pennsylvania - where McCain is expected to deliver his own speech on the economy today - and later New York. Then tomorrow comes the final presidential debate. Oddly, given yesterday's shift in the tone of the Republican campaign, McCain adviser Tucker Bounds seemed to say on Fox News yesterday that McCain would challenge Obama during the debate over his association with William Ayers. \"So much of a debate is determined by the moderator and the questions that are posed to the candidates,\" Bounds said, \"[but] I expect that it could come up. And I expect John McCain will ask Barack Obama to speak truthfully about his relationship with friend and unrepentant terrorist Bill Ayers.\"</p> <h2>Latest polls</h2> <p>Obama slightly increased his lead in Gallup's tracking poll, which puts the candidates at 51% to 41%, and slightly reduced it in Rasmussen's, which is at Obama 50%, McCain 45%. A Washington Post/ABC News poll of likely voters echoed Gallup's 10-point lead, putting McCain at 43% to Obama's 53%. \"Though every race is different,\" an ABC pollster said, \"no presidential candidate has come back from an October deficit this large in pre-election polls dating to 1936.\"</p> <h2>Quote of the day</h2> <p>\"Jobs, baby, jobs.\" Hillary Clinton, parodying the Republican chant of \"drill, baby, drill\", seemed finally to be enjoying herself, stumping for Obama in Pennsylvania.</p> <h2>On theguardian.com</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/14/uselections2008-johnmccain1\">McCain plays valiant underdog as once-loyal south looks uncertain</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/uselectionroadtrip/2008/oct/14/roseanne-barr-marc-maron\">Video: 'A nation run by old men on Viagra', says Roseanne Barr</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/14/uselections2000-barackobama\">Obama campaign finds prejudice lingers in blue-collar heartlands</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/14/uselections2008-sarahpalin\">Is it a boy?

  "<p>Reports leaking out from Washington overnight suggest that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/14/useconomy-usa\">the US is on the brink of partially nationalising the biggest names on Wall Street</a>, risking charges of socialism.</p> <p>George Bush is scheduled to announce new \"comprehensive action\" to strengthen the US's financial institutions shortly after 1pm BST. He is expected to confirm that one of his last acts as president will be to follow Britain's lead and bail out the banking sector.</p> <p>The US government is expected to spend around $125bn (\u00a371bn) buying stakes in nine financial institutions, with the rest going to smaller banks. It is expected to take preference shares, which provide more protection than ordinary shares and a guaranteed dividend.</p> <p>Before the credit crunch, the idea of Goldman Sachs or JP Morgan being partially nationalised would have seemed absurd.

But the plan may be attacked by Republicans, some of whom claim the original plan to buy up toxic assets was \"un-American\".</p> <p>Robert Reich, former labour secretary to Bill Clinton, said Paulson had been considering buying stakes in Wall Street banks but did not draw attention to the fact.</p> <p>\"The provision that allows Paulson to buy shares in banks was clearly contained in the $700bn bail-out plan, but he did not talk about it very much because it sounds very much like socialism and Republicans would recall from that. So it was kept under wraps, but it was there in the legislation,\" said Reich, on Radio 4's Today programme.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Jeff Jarvis</strong> has taken me to task twice, in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/oct/13/digital-media\">yesterday's print section</a>, and last week <a href=\"http://www.buzzmachine.com/2008/10/08/it-is-our-fault/\">on his blog</a>, because he disagrees with my contention that journalists are not responsible for the decline of newspapers.</p> <p>I hold somewhat similar views to City University's <strong>Adrian Monck</strong>, both <a href=\"http://adrianmonck.com/2008/02/the-decline-of-newspapers-nothing-to-do-with-journalism/\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://adrianmonck.com/2008/10/the-decline-of-newspapers-nothing-to-do-with-journalism-again/\">here</a>, and with the <strong>Washington Post</strong> writer <strong>Paul Farhi</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.ajr.org/Article.asp?id=4623\">here</a>. A reminder of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/greenslade/2008/oct/03/1\">what I wrote</a>, as quoted by Jeff: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"There cannot be any doubt that journalists themselves... cannot be held responsible for either the financial woes of the industry nor for the public turning its back on the 'products' that contain their work... They are blameless.\"</p> <p>They have \"no reason to feel guilty... It isn't our fault... The truth is that we are being assailed by revolutionary technological forces completely outside of our control... You are not the cause of the current calamity.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>I stand by every word, but Jeff says that I doth protest too much. He writes:<br> </p> <blockquote> <p>\"The fall of journalism is journalists' fault. It is our fault we did not see change coming soon enough and ready our craft for its transition. It is our fault we did not exploit - hell, too many resisted - the opportunities new media and new relationships with the public presented. </p> <p>\"It is our fault we lost readers and squandered trust. It is our fault we did not give adequate stewardship to journalism and left business to the business people. It is our fault we sat back and expected some princely patron to support us.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>That assumes that journalists have power, that they could have exploited the opportunities of new media without the support (or otherwise) of newspaper owners and managers. In truth, in a newsprint media overwhelmingly controlled by large media companies, journalists have had no room to manoeuvre beyond the wishes, and pockets, of their employers. </p> <p>It is all very well to blame journalists for leaving business to the business people, but what was the alternative? In the 1970s, when I was an NUJ activist and a member of a Marxist party, I had a clear idea about workers seizing control of newspapers' editorial agenda. (And everything else, of course). </p> <p>That attempt, prefigured in the failed attempt to enforce an NUJ closed shop, sounds both crazily idealistic and, I readily concede, at the same time, madly illiberal and totalitarian. But the closed shop campaign, which united owners and editors (along with the majority of both Fleet Street and regional journalists), did prove beyond any shadow of doubt that media owners ruled the roost.</p> <p>Attempts to set up viable alternatives to the mainstream British press have failed hopelessly. The brief flowering of an agit-prop press in the early 1970s died. Later attempts (<strong>News on Sunday</strong>!) were always marginal. Big media has ruled.</p> <p>And it has ruled internally too. Journalists conform to the wishes of their owner-editor masters or take a hike. There has been room for some dissension within some papers (such as <strong>The Guardian</strong> and <strong>The Observer</strong>) but these have been very rare exceptions. </p> <p>The hierarchical power structure did not allow for much journalistic innovation before the rise of the internet. There has been a great deal since in almost every paper, but we're talking about the past here, about journalism's alleged former failures.</p> <p>It is plainly wrong to say that all old print journalism was bad (and got us into the economic mess the industry faces) just as it would be wrong to say that all new media journalism is good. The journalism of the former era, that was carried within the newsprint paradigm, has nothing to be ashamed of.</p> <p>Yes, there were bad journalists and bad journalism. Yes, we can now see that it was top-down journalism, with us acting as gatekeepers to the news. But I think I see why Jeff has got this so wrong. Britain's journalists, unlike America's, were never as pompous and po-faced as their US counterparts. Seen from a British context, Jeff's assault makes almost no sense.</p> <p>Even among the bone-headed print dinosaurs who refuse to acknowledge the coming demise of print there are journalists who have made valuable contributions to our trade (and go on doing so). Similarly, there are plenty of enthusiastic digital converts who probably do not rank among the finest of our ilk.</p> <p>As for Jeff's argument about the squandering of trust, that has been a long-run phenomenon, arguably dating back to the invention of newsprint. However, once again, I think there has been a difference between the US and British experiences.</p> <p>But let me turn away now from a defence of journalism past because I agree that the journalism of the future is what counts, and I'm therefore with Jeff when he says that our task is to use the new tools to create a new, and better, form of journalism.</p> <p>That said, within existing media organisations the central problem in achieving such an ambition remains unchanged. The power lies with the employer. While some owners are encouraging their staffs to be inventive they are, at the same time, reducing staffs to levels that stifle the possibility of innovation.</p> <p>So the dilemma for journalists who wish to build a new journalistic Jerusalem is, like everything else in this world, an economic one. They need to make a living and must necessarily make compromises to do so. Working within that reality it seems grossly unfair to blame journalists for the journalism they are required to produce.</p> <p>Yet, and this has to be taken on board, there is still much to celebrate about our current journalism in Britain, in print and on the net. For example, journalists have risen to the task of reporting on, and explaining, the current global financial crisis with considerable verve.</p> <p>I'm all for a more democratic form of journalism, a journalism of participation and a journalism based on a continuous conversation. But I also appreciate the journalism of knowledge, of a \"professional journalism\" if you like, that provides information and analysis in order to inform the public.</p>",
  "<p>More than a third of people questioned believe church schools create divisions between different sections of society although there is broad backing for faith schools, according to a poll released by the Church of England today.</p> <p>The church said it had \"work to do\" demonstrating that fair admissions procedures operated, particularly in oversubscribed voluntary-aided schools.</p> <p>The study found a large minority \u2013 45% \u2013 of those who agreed that church schools were different from local authority-run schools believed children from better-off backgrounds were more likely to get places.</p> <p>The poll of 1,000 people, released as the church opened two new academies in Hull and Scunthorpe, found 63% felt parents should have the opportunity to choose faith-based schools.</p> <p>Under an agreement two years ago, the Church of England committed itself to reserving at least 25% of places in new voluntary-aided schools for pupils from the local neighbourhood, regardless of faith.</p> <p>Almost all church-sponsored academies had 100% neighbourhood admissions, said the Church of England's chief education officer, the Rev Jan Ainsworth.</p> <p>\"The Church of England has consistently supported the ban on interviews or the seeking of other information about the family during the admissions process,\" she added.</p> <p>\"Church attendance is the only measure our schools use when allocating places on the basis of faith, and churches are open to anyone, irrespective of background or income.</p> <p>\"However, governing bodies and the wider sector need to be crystal clear in the way that admissions policies are implemented and communicated.\"</p> <p>The survey found 58% considered that church schools do not contribute to creating divisions in society but worryingly for the church, this optimism was much lower (37%) among 18- to 24-year-olds.</p> <p>A large majority (78%) agreed that church schools promote good behaviour and positive attitudes while 79% agreed church schools help young people develop a sense of right and wrong.</p> <p>The archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Rowan Williams, will open St Lawrence's Academy in Scunthorpe today and tomorrow the archbishop of York, Dr John Sentamu, will open the Archbishop Sentamu Academy in east Hull.</p>",
  "<p>To much fanfare, Hazel Blears, the communities secretary and Ed Balls, children, schools and families secretary, have launched the \"Young Muslim Advisory Group\" (YMAG) to work directly with the government to help deepen its engagement with young Muslims.</p> <p>According to an <a href=\"http://www.nya.org.uk/information/113489/youngmuslimadvisorygroup/\">advertisement</a> for the group, the objective behind YMAG is to \"talk directly to government on issues, aspirations and concerns that inform the lives of young Muslims in England\". It is further stated that the government will offer \"support in taking a peer leadership role in their communities\".</p> <p>The group of 22 young people aged between 16 and 25 is already being dubbed \"<a href=\"http://www.theasiannews.co.uk/news/s/1071199_the_next_generation_of_muslim_community_leaders\">the next generation of Muslim leaders</a>\". Has the government not learnt that its policy of self-appointed community leaders and opinion formers is deeply misguided? One simply cannot treat the Muslim community as one homogeneous block. YMAG may be comprised of capable individuals from varied backgrounds across England but the group can never be truly representative of all Muslim youth and the basis on which the government proceeds to formulate policy. In any event, as <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/labour/3155177/Baroness-Warsi-Labours-Young-Muslim-Advisory-Group-is-patronising-and-divisive.html\">Baroness Warsi</a>, the shadow minister for community cohesion, stated, the issues facing young people from a Muslim background are predominantly the same issues that all young people in this country face, whatever their background, race, or religion.</p> <p>Where will it stop? Is every racial or religious community to have its own separate group? What about the dominant Christian community? It is deeply divisive to have one group dealing solely with \"Muslim issues\". The formation of such group on the basic of religion or ethnicity feeds into the discourse of \"us\" versus \"them\". Is it, then, any wonder that those Muslims who are fully integrated sometimes hesitate to put their heads above the parapet and add their voices to the discussion of issues like community cohesion and extremism?</p> <p>The formation of groups like YMAG also adds to a bloated bureaucracy of quangos and government advisors. The fear is that the YMAG may simply end up being another talking shop which will, in practice, change very little. Will any report or recommendations produced as a result even have legitimacy amongst Muslim communities? Why form a separate layer of quasi-official advisors between the government and various communities anyway? Why not work directly with and seek the guidance of voluntary and charitable groups, schools and the like already at the frontline tackling difficult societal issues in such communities?</p> <p>Coming from an ethnic minority background myself, I am as worried as the next person about the challenges presented by the erosion of community cohesion in this country. However, part of what makes me a Conservative is a deep-seated belief in individual liberty. I'm now in my 30s, but growing up I knew one thing. I wanted to be defined as an individual and not just a tick in the box on a diversity form. Nor did I want any group to supposedly speak for me. As I (like many kids) grappled with issues of identity, I wanted to belong and be part of mainstream British society. YMAG and groups like it simply reinforce the feeling of being different.</p> <p>The government's policy of state multiculturalism, downplaying the importance of imparting knowledge of British history, traditions or values in schools and elsewhere, is undermining the very concept of who we are as a nation. In contrast, reinforcing our British identity would help those who arrive on our shores and grow up in this country to integrate. </p> <p>The creation of religion-based groups like YMAG is divisive because it approaches the subject of community cohesion from the standpoint of an assumption of difference. I am tired of the politics of \"the other\". It's about time we embraced the language of \"we\". We, the British people \u2013 irrespective of background \u2013 must stand on a united platform on issues such as social cohesion and extremism. Let us try and forge a collective, not a divided response to the problems we face in Britain.</p>",
  "<p>David Davis today said that the government's decision to drop the provisions for 42-day pre-charge detention from its counter-terrorism bill had \"vindicated\" him for resigning as shadow home secretary.</p> <p>He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the Labour proposal had \"failed miserably\" and that the government would not try to bring it back.</p> <p>Last night the House of Lords voted by a majority of 191 to take the 42-day provisions out of the counter-terrorism bill. Jacqui Smith, the home secretary, said that she would not try to reverse the defeat, but that, if there were a terrorist emergency, she would bring the proposal back in a new bill.</p> <p>Davis, who resigned from the shadow cabinet to fight a byelection over his opposition to 42 days after the measure was approved by the Commons, said today he was \"happy to burn out a career for a success like that\".</p> <p>Davis said that at the time of the byelection it looked as if the government would respond to a defeat in the Lords by getting the Commons to overturn it.</p> <p>\"I feel vindicated, because before I resigned it looked like it would go through in a ping-pong,\" he said, referring to the process whereby bills can shuttle between the Lords and the Commons before eventually being passed.</p> <p>Davis also claimed that the bill had been introduced for political reasons. \"It has been about trying to give the Labour party a 'tougher-than-Tory' model in the public mind,\" he said.</p> <p>Lord Goldsmith, the Labour former attorney general and an opponent of 42 days, said the government's climbdown was \"absolutely the right decision\" as the measure was \"not only unnecessary but also dangerous\".</p> <p>The home secretary's alternative legislation was a non-starter unless there was an extremely different scenario facing the UK, he added.</p> <p>Pete Wishart, the home affairs spokesman for the Scottish National party, said: \"The government has been forced into a cataclysmic climbdown on 42 days following their overwhelming defeat in the House of Lords.\"</p> <p>He said that Smith's decision to prepare another 42-days bill for use in an emergency was \"an extraordinary demonstration of petulant defiance\".</p> <p>The Muslim youth organisation the Ramadhan Foundation said the defeat of 42 days was \"good riddance to bad legislation\".</p> <p>The Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission also welcomed the proposal's defeat.</p> <p>Monica McWilliams, the NIHRC's chief commissioner, said: \"The commission has continually warned against this provision that would allow the state to hold persons for six weeks without charge and has raised concerns about its compatibility with the right to liberty enshrined in article five of the European Convention on Human Rights.\"</p>",

The largest increase occurred in developing countries, where the rate rose to 79% from 68% in the preceding period. At the current pace, the world literacy rate will reach nearly 87% in 2015. <br> However, more than 75% of the millions of illiterate adults live in only 15 countries, including Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India and Nigeria. And in areas of high population growth, increased literacy rates do not necessarily indicate a decline in the absolute number of illiterate adults. In parts of sub-Saharan Africa the number of non-literate adults increased from 133 million to 163 million. In Arab states, the increase was from 55 million to 58 million. </p> <p>The literacy gender gap also remains a concern. Some 63% of illiterate adults were women in the period 1985 to 1994, compared to 64% in 2000 to 2006. <br> Unless progress is significantly accelerated, most countries in sub-Saharan Africa, south and west Asia and the Arab states will miss the UN goal of halving adult illiteracy rates by 2015.</p> <p>\"As we begin the second half of the United Nations literacy decade, the international community must seek new ways to work with marginalised populations for whom traditional approaches have proved ineffective,\" said the director general of Unesco, Ko\u00efchiro Matsuura.</p>",
  "<p>Securing a new agreement with the Iraqi government within the next few weeks to allow the continued presence of British troops in the country is of \"critical\" importance, a Foreign Office minister said today. </p> <p>Bill Rammell, the new minister for the Middle East, said that the British government was working towards a new, \"civilian-led\" relationship with Iraq in 2009 as the Iraqi forces increasingly take charge of the security situation.</p> <p>But without a Status of Forces Agreement, the UK would have to seek the rollover of its United Nations mandate to maintain a military presence in Iraq, which Rammell said would send out an \"unfortunate\" message and undermine progress towards normality in the country.</p> <p>The UN mandate runs out at the end of the year, and there are concerns that a bid to renew it may face opposition in the security council from Russia or others opposed to the US-led war. </p> <p>Negotiations between the US and the Iraqi government over a State of Forces Agreement for American troops have been stuck for months on the question of legal jurisdiction and immunity for possible crimes. </p> <p>Rammell, who is making his first visit to Baghdad, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme said the government was seeking to secure a Status of Forces Agreement for British troops when the UN mandate runs out at the end of this year. </p> <p>\"The Americans are currently in detailed discussions. As that concludes, as I hope it will very shortly, we will then secure our own arrangements,\" he said. </p> <p>\"I think that will be very important because it will be a further demonstration that actually the troops are no longer here at the behest of the UN. It is an explicit agreement that's been negotiated and agreed with the Iraqi government and a further indication that the Iraqis are transforming their situation and becoming a more mature democracy and government ... </p> <p>\"What is critical is that in the next few days and weeks we resolve the issue, because were we to reach the end of the year and had to roll over the UN mandate, I think that would send out an unfortunate message that would undermine the genuine progress that is being made in taking Iraq forward and the Iraqis increasingly taking on their own responsibility in terms of governance.\" </p> <p>The foreign minister said that he expected there to be no difference to the US approach to obtaining a Status of Forces Agreement for their own troops whether Barack Obama or John McCain won the November 4 presidential election. </p> <p>And he restated Gordon Brown's July prediction that next year would see a \"fundamental change of mission\" for British troops in Iraq.<br> Nouri al-Maliki, the Iraqi prime minister, was yesterday quoted as saying that Britain's military presence in Basra was \"not necessary for maintaining security and control\", though he added that there might be a need for their experience in training. </p> <p>Rammell said Maliki's comments acknowledged the shift that had taken place over the last year whereby British troops had moved from a combat role to one based much more on training and mentoring.</p> <p>British troops had trained 20,000 Iraqi troops, which had helped the Iraqis to secure their own situation.<br> Rammell said: \"As a result of that kind of initiative, the security situation in Basra has transformed in recent months. </p> <p>\"Our forces are concluding their task, so at that point we do expect in 2009 a fundamental change in mission as we make the transformation to a long-term civilian-led future relationship with Iraq ... </p> <p>\"I think we will be able to do that really fundamental shift from a combat role to training and mentoring because we are - despite some continuing difficulties - seeing a huge and positive change in Iraq.\"</p> <p>He said violence was at the lowest levels since early 2004, Iraqi forces were in charge of 11 out of 18 provinces, an election law recently passed would hopefully in a short time lead to provincial elections, and there was much stronger engagement from Arab neighbours of Iraq.</p>",

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/celebrity\">Celebrities</a> were out in force at Diesel's 30th birthday party this weekend. This event took place in 17 cities around the world, each one attracting top DJs and musicians as well as the glitterati. Unfortunately, it seems that most of the celebs forgot to check the mirror before they left the house. </p> <p>The party saw guests wearing the most godawful outfits that have ever flounced their way onto a dancefloor. Literally no one got it right. There were those who we expected to look a little odd - <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/gallery/2008/oct/03/parisfashionweek.celebrities?picture=338217960\">Roisin Murphy</a>, for instance, most recently spotted at <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/parisfashionweek\">Paris fashion week</a> wearing what seemed to be cross between an office ventilation system and a stormtrooper. Saturday's carefully put-together outfit consisted of a puffy peach satin affair topped off with a black fez. </p> <p>Then there was Lindsay Lohan, who seemed to have been tangoed by a big bottle of fake tan. Except - whoops! - she had forgotten all about her feet, which were still snowy white. Paris Hilton brought along a slightly-less-glamorous-than-me sort of friend, thought to be a contestant from her reality TV show, New BFF.</p> <p>Then, of course, there was entertainment. It came in the shape of young Patrick Wolf, the man who entered the world of music by making his <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Wolf\">first theremin at age eleven</a>. Nice. He'd obviously been paying close attention at Paris fashion week, judging by his Martin Margiela-inspired hairy shoulder pads and his chainmail headgear. Our favourite quote from dear Patrick comes from the <a href=\"http://www.thelondonpaper.com/cs/Satellite/london/music/article/1157145572163?packedargs=suffix%3DSubSectionArticle\">London Paper</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>I live a life full of possibilities ...

  "<p>In theory I should now be dead. Not from disease or an accident but because of the simple fact that my head was set to be severed from my body with a sharp sword in a public square in Riyadh, the Saudi Arabian capital. </p> <p>In 2001, I was condemned to die in this brutal archaic fashion after being caught up in what became known as the \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/aug/09/saudiarabia.paulkelso2\">Saudi Brits</a>\" affair. Along with eight others, I was rounded up by the panicked Saudi authorities after a series of attacks on foreigners in the kingdom suddenly started to make this expat country of choice seem distinctly unsafe. </p> <p>Desperate to pin a nascent anti-government insurgency on squabbling \"bootlegger\" foreigners (anything rather than concede that ultra-safe Saudi Arabia had an internal terrorism problem), we were to be the sacrificial lambs. Remember those bizarre, wooden \"confessions\", haltingly delivered by scared looking men on national Saudi television? One of those came from me. If I looked petrified it may have been because I'd been dragged to prison, threatened, sleep-deprived and beaten so severely that I almost died from heart attacks. </p> <p>In a numbed state of shock, I would have confessed to anything. As it was, I said I'd committed a series of laughably implausible \"turf war\" crimes that never even existed. The farce continued. I was subjected to two perfunctory, completely scripted trials at which I was told to plead guilty and beg for mercy. I was sentenced to death, tried again twice without even being in the courtroom at all, and again sentenced to death by beheading. </p> <p>This, remember, is what happened just a handful of years ago in a justice system of an influential Middle Eastern country that enjoys excellent diplomatic relations with most of the world's powerful countries, including Britain. It was only this time last year, for example, that we were rolling out the red carpet for King Abdullah's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/blog/2007/oct/30/thestatevisitofkingabdull\">state visit</a>. </p> <p>So, how did I come to be alive to write this for the Guardian today? Simple. Belonging to a wealthy \"client\" nation like the United Kingdom means that while you can be tortured and falsely imprisoned in Saudi Arabia, in practice you are not going to suffer a brutal demise in \"chop chop\" square in this execution-addicted country. </p> <p>At the time of my ordeal there was much talk of \"diplomatic efforts\" to secure our release. This was mostly UK government spin \u2013 they had to put it about that they were trying hard to get us out. Yes, they will have exerted pressure on the Riyadh authorities but I later learnt that I and my fellow detainees had been released as part of a \"prisoner exchange\" involving five Saudis being held by the US at Guant\u00e1namo Bay. </p> <p>Finally released in August 2003, after 964 days of solitary confinement, torture and dehumanising terror, I harbour no illusions about what saved me: my passport. There was no apology, no official pardon, just a perfunctory granting of \"clemency\" and immediate expulsion from the country. An accident of birth had preserved me and eventually my release became a political expediency. </p> <p>Ironically, even the manner of my release further confirmed the politically corrupt nature of the Saudi system of justice. Foreign workers like me, subject to bogus trials and languishing in miserable jails, can only hope that the Saudi lottery of false mercy will save them. Meanwhile, of course, Saudi's poor migrant workers from Somalia, Bangladesh, the Philippines or Pakistan are virtually doomed if they face a capital charge (not all for lethal crimes, incidentally). </p> <p>Anyone who might somehow think that Saudi justice is harsh but fair should read a new <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org.uk/uploads/documents/doc_18728.pdf\">Amnesty International report</a> (pdf) which shows that the legal system is heavily rigged, with well-connected Saudi nationals up to eight times more likely to negotiate \"blood money\" pay-offs to victims' families that lead to commutation. </p> <p>Certainly one shouldn't forget that ordinary Saudis without the right connections are also going to their deaths in this lethal lottery of a justice system. The latest figures show that this blood-soaked country is on average executing at least two people every single week. </p> <p>In my experience what passes for a judicial system in Saudi Arabia has less to do with investigating crime and punishing criminals, and far more to do with maintaining control and compliance among both its own citizens and its community of ex-patriot workers. </p> <p>Why should we care? Well, apart from the fact that thousands of British people go to work in this country every year and that Britain continues to maintain extremely cordial relations with the Saudi royals, this wretched system is simply an affront, not only to justice but to our common humanity. </p> <p>If ever there was an advertisement for the abolition of the death penalty and for all that is wrong with its application, Saudi (in)justice provides it. </p> <p>I can only ask: when are western governments going to stop pandering to the Saudi princes? Or could it be that they prefer to go on burying their heads in the sand?</p>",
  "<p>Detachment used to be an essential part of press box etiquette. Not so long ago there was even a specific, if rather sniffy, phrase \u2013 \"fans with typewriters\" \u2013 to describe reporters who did not even attempt to subvert their personal allegiances when covering, say, Scottish football. The advent of blogging and computer keyboards has altered all that. Fail to offer an opinion on the hour every hour seven days a week and people assume you must be ill. <br> There are certain sports news items, though, which do not so much tug at your emotions as punch you in the heart. The past few days have yielded two desperately sad examples. We can only pray that Seve Ballesteros, currently stuck in the medical equivalent of waist-high rough, summons up the sort of miracle recovery which was once his trademark. And, while we are on our knees, spare a thought for James Forrester, Gloucester's erstwhile back-row forward. It is cruel when anyone has retire at a young age; to see the athletic Forrester chopped down prematurely is a crying shame.  Those who only glimpsed Forrester a couple of times may wonder what the fuss is all about. Players retire early all the time and the 27-year-old was hardly a household name, despite his two England caps. But sometimes statistics tell considerably less than half the story. They do not take into account the priceless ability to light up a stadium with one nonchalant flash of skill or speed. As a kid Forrester kicked goals for his school first XV and had football trials with Oxford United as a centre-back. He wasn't really built like an international forward but possessed the hands and footwork of an NBA legend. His knees were knobbly, his modest demeanour almost apologetic at times but he did things no England back-row forward has been capable of since Andy Ripley. </p> <p>Various mental snapshots present themselves: a turbo-charged hat-trick of tries against Bristol at the Memorial Ground in December 2001, an eye-catching display alongside James Simpson-Daniel for England against the Barbarians when Jonah Lomu trailed in the pair's slipstream and the celebratory bird impressions of his team-mates during last year's Premiership play-offs in homage to their absent No8 with the impressively prominent nose. Forrester was always uncomfortably aware he did not resemble the average player. \"The other day I was looking at photos of myself when I first started,\" he confided the last time we talked. \"It was scary. No wonder I used to get injured a lot, I was just a stick.\" </p> <p>Now, unfortunately, the stick has snapped once too often. The possessor of what he once called \"girly wrists\" has suffered yet another serious knee setback and will be galloping around our fields no more. The good news, if his family history is any guide, is that he will respond well to his present adversity. His late grandfather, Major-General Michael Forrester, was awarded two DSOs and two MCs during the Second World War and played a prominent role in protecting Crete from the Nazis. \"Out of the trees came Capt Forrester in a long yellow army jersey, waving his revolver in his right hand,\" read one eye-witness account. \"He was tall, thin-faced, fair-haired, with no tin hat \u2013 the very opposite of a soldier hero. It was a most inspiring sight. The Germans fled.\" </p> <p>More recently Forrester junior and his family attended the unveiling of an eight-foot high memorial in the southern Italian town of Scafati to mark the 65th anniversary of the battle which proved decisive in the Allied forces' drive through Italy. Maj-Gen Forrester and fellow soldiers of the Queen's Royal Regiment, together with partisans he had trained, attacked German forces from behind and cleared mines under the Sarno bridge, saving the town from a grim fate. \"The Nazi commander had his finger on the detonator to blow up the bridge as my grandfather took it,\" recounted Forrester. \"It saved a lot of civilian casualties and the whole town would have had to have been rebuilt.\" </p> <p>Rebuilding an alternative career will, hopefully, be less stressful. At least, unlike Ballesteros, his life is not under threat. It is just the rest of us who must mourn the passing of a shooting star who, under the new experimental law variation requiring defenders to retreat five metres back from scrums, might well have come into his own. In common with the former Southampton footballer Matt Le Tissier, he was an artiste amongst artisans who never subscribed to the stereotypical norm. Now there is only his great mate James Simpson-Daniel left. If Sinbad crumples beneath a heavy tackle between now and the autumn Tests, rugby's new romantic era really will be over. <br> <strong>Rhythm section</strong><br> It is a dull column that drones on endlessly about refereeing interpretations at the breakdown. But if the aim of the International Rugby Board was to simplify the game and entice the floating voter, their recent initiatives are clearly failing. Pinging anyone who topples even momentarily off their feet, allied to prolonged bouts of aerial kick-tennis, is having precisely the opposite effect. Were Montauban guilty of a ruck offence in the closing stages against Munster? It was pretty hard to tell for certain, even in slow motion. When referees are encouraged to use a magnifying glass and a slide-rule at the tackle area, it makes for a desperately frustrating, anally-retentive product. I share the view of Duke Ellington: \"It ain't worth a thing if it ain't got that swing.\" </p> <p><strong>Cheats prosper</strong> <br> While we're on the subject of Europe, the rise in on-field cynicism was impossible to miss last weekend. Leinster had Felipe Contepomi sin-binned for a blatant professional foul against Edinburgh and Chris Whitaker should have seen yellow for a similarly crude offence. The Ospreys were denied a match-winning late try when Leicester's Harry Ellis made a totally illegal nuisance of himself at the vital five-metre scrum. Toulouse's Byron Kelleher could be heard complaining loudly to the ref about Butch James being offside when, in reality, the fly-half's chargedown was perfectly legal. If you can get away with it etc etc. All the three guilty teams I've mentioned won their matches. It is starting to make Neil Back's infamous \"Back-hander\" in the 2002 final against Munster feel positively quaint.</p>",

  "<p>An MP today called for a parliamentary inquiry into claims that British agents were involved in the interrogation of detainees in Ethiopia who had been illegally transported from neighbouring Somalia.</p> <p>The BBC reported that at least 10 men were held for around 18 months, during which time they claimed they were denied access to lawyers and mistreated, including by being shackled and having their hands cuffed behind their backs for such long periods it caused intense pain.</p> <p>The men were allegedly removed from Somalia by extraordinary rendition \u2013 the illegal transfer of prisoners from one state to another, for interrogation and without a formal extradition process. </p> <p>Although there was no allegation that British officials were involved in any mistreatment of detainees, the BBC said it had spoken to five former prisoners who claimed British agents took part in their interrogation, seeking information about UK citizens who had visited Somalia.</p> <p>The men claimed that their questioning was conducted by Ethiopians, directed by American agents.</p> <p>The lawless east African state of Somalia is viewed by intelligence agencies as a hotbed of Islamist radicalism and a haven for al-Qaida militants. </p> <p>BBC Radio 4's Today programme broadcast an interview with a Kenyan man called Salim Awadh, who was released along with seven other fellow-countrymen last week from detention in Addis Ababa. </p> <p>The men had been held since January 2007, when Ethiopian troops took control of the Somali capital, Mogadishu, ousting the Union of Islamic Courts, an Islamist movement which had controlled much of southern Somalia for the previous six months.</p> <p>Awadh said: \"A week after we arrived, we were interrogated by whites - Americans, British, MI5, MI6, FBI. I was taken away and placed in isolation for two months. My hands and legs were shackled. The interrogations went on for five months.</p> <p>\"During the interrogation, when I complained to the Americans 'Where are my human rights? Where is the democracy you have been talking about?', they said 'There is no democracy here, there are no human rights here' and the British were present at this time.\"</p> <p>The chairman of the House of Commons all-party group on extraordinary rendition, the Tory MP Andrew Tyrie, said the allegations should be investigated by the parliamentary intelligence and security committee.</p> <p>Tyrie told Today: \"If British officials have been involved in interrogating people who have been rendered illegally outside any due process of law, then there is a prima facie case for saying they have broken the law - British law - and that would need to be investigated.\"</p> <p>Human rights lawyer Louise Christian said: \"If the British security services know or ought to have known that the person was being tortured, that they were being held incommunicado without a lawyer and they tried to take advantage of that by questioning the person, then the British government themselves would be in breach of international law and that should be investigated by the United Nations.\"</p> <p>The Foreign Office said it was looking into the BBC report.<br> A spokeswoman pointed out that an intelligence and security committee report published in July 2007 found \"no evidence that the UK Agencies were complicit in any 'extraordinary rendition' operations\".</p> <p>The report dealt largely with allegations surrounding CIA \"ghost flights\" and the transfer of prisoners to Guant\u00e1namo Bay in Cuba. It made no reference to the detention of individuals in Somalia and their transfer to Ethiopian jails.</p> <p>In February, the foreign secretary, David Miliband, was forced to admit that two US extraordinary rendition flights landed on UK territory in 2002. In both cases US planes refuelled on the UK dependent territory of Diego Garcia.</p> <p>In a Commons statement, Miliband said he was \"very sorry\" to say that previous denials made in \"good faith\" were wrong.</p>",
  "<p>Fernando Torres has described Uefa's decision to move <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool\">Liverpool's</a> Champions League match against his old club <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/atleticomadrid\">Atl\u00e9tico Madrid</a> to a neutral venue as the worst possible news. The Liverpool striker had been looking forward to returning to the Vicente Calderon stadium but accepted the decision had been made for the right reasons. </p> <p>Uefa issued the three-match stadium ban against the Madrid club following crowd trouble and racist comments at Atl\u00e9tico's game against Marseille on October 1. The Liverpool game is due to be held next Tuesday and the decision to switch the venue at such short notice has also been heavily criticised by the club's chief executive Rick Parry and by supporters' clubs, who have already made travel arrangements for Madrid.</p> <p>\"After so much time waiting, it is the worst and most unexpected news that I could have heard this morning,\" Torres told the Spanish newspaper Marca. \"I'm eager to go back. I don't know if it is definitive, I hope that a solution can be found. It is a shame that these incidents have forced the stadium to be closed, but if this is what happens then we have to accept it.\" </p> <p>The decision will also affect Atl\u00e9tico's game against <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/psveindhoven\">PSV Eindhoven</a> on November 26, but the final match ban will only be invoked if there is a repeat of crowd trouble or racist chanting within the next five years. </p> <p>Valencia is believed to be the most likely venue for the game, which must be played at least 300km outside Madrid. The ruling is Uefa's heaviest ever punishment for racism and is accompanied by a \u20ac150,000 (\u00a3120,000) fine and a two-match touchline ban for Atl\u00e9tico coach Javier Aguirre for insulting Marseille players. The club have until October 17 to appeal the decision and Atl\u00e9tico have said they will contest it.</p> <p>Parry is concerned about the timing of the announcement so close to next week's match. \"To say the decision is a bit late in the day, is to put it mildly,\" he said. \"We have 3,000 fans going to the game and we are extremely concerned for our supporters, the vast majority of whom have already made travel arrangements.<br> \"If the match is played at least 300 kilometres from Madrid, it will cause major disruption, inconvenience and large additional expense for our fans. Uefa have to take their needs into account when making a final decision on the game.\"</p> <p>Fans' groups also expressed their anger. \"Making this decision with a week's notice is idiotic and it benefits no one,\" Spirit of Shankly spokesman James McKenna said in a statement. \"Uefa should wait until after we have played Atl\u00e9tico. That then gives them enough time to make arrangements for PSV, before fans book travel or buy tickets. As it is, they have caused more problems.\"</p> <p>Torres' Liverpool team-mate and fellow Spain international Jose Reina added: \"It's a huge blow for us, the Spanish players at Liverpool. Above all for Fernando, who was the most eager of all of us to visit the Calderon. As well as that, we all had commitments, tickets agreed, and this changes all the plans.\" </p> <p>Uefa spokesman William Gaillard said they sympathised with Liverpool fans and were working closely with the club, but were left with no alternative after the incidents at the Marseille match. </p> <p>\"We are in touch with Liverpool because we are concerned about the fans. We know they face hardship and disruption and we sympathise with that, but we needed to punish Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. We have no alternative. What would people have said if Liverpool went there and the players and fans suffered the same treatment? We know how sensitive the British public are about racism and violence - and rightly so.</p> <p>\"This is to protect Liverpool fans too - the police were harsh and violent against peaceful fans during the Marseille game and do we want the same story as that, or as happened to the Tottenham fans in Seville last year?\"</p> <p>Gaillard said they were already talking to the club about moving charter flights and Uefa would help in any way they could. \"We are looking at the logistics and seeing what help we can provide,\" he added. </p> <p>And the move received a much more positive response from anti-racism campaigners. Former Chelsea defender Paul Elliott, ambassador for European campaigners FARE, said: \"Uefa's decision sets out a zero-tolerance policy that underlines respect for the rights of human beings whatever their race, religion or ethnic background.\"</p>",
  "<p>The threat from terrorism is now \"at the severe end of severe\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/jacquismith\">Jacqui Smith</a> said today as she urged opposition parties to back a fresh bill to extend pre-charge detention for terror suspects to 42 days.</p> <p>Speaking the day after the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/13/terrorism-uksecurity1\">government suffered a crushing defeat</a> in the Lords over the controversial plans to allow police to detain terror suspects without charge up to six weeks, the home secretary said it was her responsibility to prepare for the possibility that a lengthy investigation into a terror plot may be needed. </p> <p>Smith announced last night that the government would not seek to overturn the vote after the proposal was thrown out by a massive majority of 191 in the upper chamber. </p> <p>In what was widely seen as a face-saving measure for the government, she said the plans would instead be the subject of a separate bill to be put to parliament if needed in an emergency, despite warnings from critics that any such attempt to revive it was doomed to failure. </p> <p>Smith told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"We need to find a way through this, even if other political parties won't engage on it. That's why I brought forward to the Commons yesterday a bill that is ready-prepared so that if - and I fear when - we face a situation that is so complex, so difficult, so potentially dangerous and requires us to investigate somebody for longer than 28 days, it will be there, ready to be brought before parliament.\"</p> <p>Smith confirmed that the new legislation, the counter-terrorism (temporary provisions) bill, would be introduced in parliament if just one individual was deemed to pose a serious risk. </p> <p>\"We have always been clear in these circumstances that we are talking about a very small number of people,\" she said.</p> <p>\"We are talking about exceptional circumstances but we are talking about circumstances that might bring frankly catastrophic results to people in this country if they are not countered.\"</p> <p>Smith acknowledged the \"difficult balance\" between national security and individual liberty.</p> <p>She said: \"Because the results are potentially so catastrophic, it is my responsibility to cover off that risk. The thing about opposition is you don't have to cover off the risk, but government rightly does. That is why I have brought forward yesterday the proposal that I did.<br> \"I hope we never will have to, but I fear we may bring it forward and I hope we can count on people's support [if we do].\"</p> <p>The scale of last night's rebellion in the Lords left the government little choice but to ditch the plans, when faced with the prospect of a bruising return to the Commons and a fresh rebellion by Labour backbenchers.<br> Opposition in the Lords was spearheaded by senior figures including two former MI5 directors, two ex-lord chancellors a former chief constable and former attorney general Lord Goldsmith. </p> <p>Smith, who claimed the support of leading anti-terror police officers, accused opponents of ignoring the threat of terrorism facing the country. </p> <p>She rounded on opposition parties whom she said had agreed with the need for an extension of pre-charge detention in exceptional circumstances but had not been prepared to back the provisions in the counter-terrorism bill.</p> <p>\"There has been consensus about that issue, but what there has not been from opposition parties, despite us as a government going out of our way to find it, is a willingness to engage in a process that would have enabled us to cover off that risk and put protecting the British people at the heart of what we do.\"</p> <p>Smith failed to address the fact, when pressed, that opponents to her plans included Labour peers and former government ministers such as Lords Irvine, Falconer, and Goldsmith.</p> <p>The Liberal Democrat leader, Nick Clegg, said the move was a \"victory for civil liberties\" and dismissed the new bill as a \"fig leaf\". </p> <p>He said: \"Generations of Britons have fought and died to preserve these freedoms and the government has learnt the hard way that they cannot be ditched on a whim. </p> <p>\"The push for 42 days detention was more about ministers posturing and looking tough than it ever was about fighting terrorism.\" </p> <p>Former shadow home secretary David Davis, who resigned his seat after the Commons vote to successfully fight a byelection on the issue, said: \"The government has undertaken a spectacular climbdown, and has come up with a proposal strikingly similar to the Civil Contingencies Act offered over a year ago. </p> <p>\"This demonstrates only too clearly that this measure has always been all about politics.\" </p> <p>Lord Goldsmith said last night that the climbdown was \"absolutely the right decision\" as the measure was \"not only unnecessary but also dangerous\". </p> <p>Shami Chakrabarti, the director of campaign group Liberty, warned the campaign against the measures would go on. </p> <p>\"Liberty has been overwhelmed by the public and parliamentary support for our campaign against this dangerous and counter-productive measure. </p> <p>\"Rest assured that if any government tries this again we will be ready.\"</p>",

I'm the same with hymns; give me To Be A Pilgrim or Dear Lord and Father any day, over happity-clappity singalongs that <a href=\"http://www.hitentertainment.com/barney/flash_mx/sites/player.asp\">Barney the Dinosaur</a> would condemn for their crushing banality.</p> <p>But then, I'm not a Christian, and my preferences are purely aesthetic. If I believed that people's only hope of avoiding hellfire was by accepting Jesus Christ as their saviour, then I'd want his message packaged in the most accessible shape or form. If sinners respond best to theological versions of chick lit and James Blunt, that's what the church should offer, ideally without jettisoning the old stuff entirely. It's bums on pews and souls in the right place that matter, not the Booker prize.</p> <p>Funnily enough, some people who profess to be Christians don't appear to think this way. The Bible Society, in tandem with the University of the West Indies, is working on a translation of the Good Book into <a href=\"http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/html/20080621T000000-0500_136972_OBS_CONTROVERSY_HEIGHTENS_OVER_PLANNED_PATOIS_BIBLE__.asp\">Jamaican patois</a>, a language spoken by about 5 million people. The redoubtable Ann Widdecombe sees this as \"<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/religion/3179269/Bible-to-be-turned-into-patois.html\">utterly ridiculous</a>\" and evidence of, you guessed it, dumbing down. Prudence Dailey of the Prayer Book Society, meanwhile, prefers older versions that \"elevated people above the everyday\" and maintained a \"sense of awe\".</p> <p>These are exactly the arguments that traditionalists used against the reforms of <a href=\"http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/index.htm\">Vatican II</a>, which led to the Catholic mass being said in a language that most of the congregation could actually understand; the same arguments, in fact, against translating the Bible itself into languages other than Latin in the first place. </p> <p>The most significant aspects of their religion would appear to be the social and political, rather than the spiritual. They speak of a Christianity not of love and forgiveness and justice, but of order and tradition and control, a society frozen at some point in about 1860. Everyone knows his or her status: the rich man in his castle and the <a href=\"http://www.cyberhymnal.org/htm/a/l/allthing.htm\">poor man at his gate</a>; women content to polish the pews and make the tea; gay people utterly invisible. If Jamaicans wish to hear the word of God, it must be enunciated in cut-glass tones; Tunbridge Wells, not Trenchtown. God, after all, sports an MCC tie.</p> <p>This whole attitude strikes me as being a tad un-Christian. But what do I know? I'm just a poor bloody heathen. And the more I hear from Widdecombe and Dailey and their ilk, the more likely I am to stay that way.</p>",
  "<p>Bust banks apart, the most interesting political development of the week has surely been <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/oct/13/uselections2008-johnmccain\">John McCain's attempt</a> to tone down the virulence of his own supporters against Barack Obama's ascendant candidacy for the American presidency. </p> <p>Good, but I remain to be convinced that Obama will win. Given the chaotic financial background to this autumn's home straight it is a scary prospect for us all if the opinion polls are overturned on November 4. Last night's <a href=\" http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/panorama/7658981.stm\">BBC Panorama</a> film by Matt Frei did not reassure me. Another \"we were robbed\" defeat will signal trouble \u2013 in Congress and on the street.</p> <p>Senator McCain must know this. His Democratic rival is \"a decent person that you do not have to be scared of as president of the United States\", he assured an angry woman in Minnesota, white heartland country. He's not an Arab either, McCain was moved to correct her. </p> <p>One can be cynical about that and similar remarks from the Republican candidate in recent days; not least because he knows he has little control over the hate-filled radio shock jobs or over informal dirty tricks campaigns of the kind we have often seen in the past. He also sanctioned the selection of Governor Sarah Palin as his running mate.</p> <p>But hey, let's not be cynical, it's a corrosive habit. Let's imagine Senator McCain enduring dark nights of the soul, bracing himself for defeat and wishing not to destroy his reputation as a man of honour, one who served his country and stood for something better than the dark arts which helped elect and sustain George W Bush's baleful presidency. Perhaps he already regrets what the reckless selection of Palin has done to that reputation.</p> <p>So why worry if Obama is steadily gaining ground in the polls in battleground states and McCain's contribution to the Republican mishandling of the financial crisis has weakened him with no need for Palin's help in undermining his credibility among thoughtful independents?</p> <p>Two reasons, both <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/oct/08/uselections2008.florida\">reported in the Guardian</a> and elsewhere. There are active campaigns to enrol black and minority voters, but also active campaigns to disfranchise them. For instance, if you need a photo ID to register (all that stuff about Americans refusing to carry European ID cards is bunk), then it is blacks who have many fewer drivers licences , only 53% according to one survey In Milwaukee.</p> <p>Only one in three Americans has the alternative document, a passport, by the way. Governor Palin may have looked at Russia across those pesky straights, but she only got hers last year. That isn't all. Purges of out-of-date addresses also screw the poor, who tend to move more. In Florida a lot of purging \u2013 some of it pretty crude \u2013 goes on.</p> <p>Oh yes, there's also the matter of 2.3 million voters disfranchised by being in jail. Blacks in the slammer outnumber Hispanics by two to one, whites by six to one. Personally I think cons should not be allowed to vote, but ex-cons remain disfranchised in many states, or have to wait seven years to reapply. In Mississippi alone there are 150,000 such non-voters.</p> <p>Another dimension of all this is reflected in the so-called Bradley Effect, named after the popular former mayor of Los Angeles, who was ahead in the polls to become governor of California in 1982 but lost to a white opponent on the day. Why? Because a lot of voters must have been reluctant to admit they would not vote for Bradley because he is black. </p> <p>Similar effects have been detecting elsewhere, for instance in New York, where Mayor David Dinkins, scraped home in 1989 despite being well ahead in the polls. One has to be careful here; he wasn't a very good mayor as I recall. But one way of playing the race card obliquely is to tack on to the ballot paper plebiscites, which seek to overturn affirmative action programmes in some states.</p> <p>I'm sure you get the picture. Some white voters will back Obama because he is black, because they think he's a remarkable and attractive candidate who will use the presidency to bind up America's wounds - at home and abroad \u2013 and restore its damaged reputation as \"the last best hope of mankind\". </p> <p>I think that too, but I don't have a vote. In any case, as noted here before, people like me don't decide elections. Many of the people who do decide them, middle class suburban Americans, may decide they can't risk it \u2013 or will simply vote against the black candidate in the booth on the day.</p> <p>But that's not all. The flip side of lurking prejudice is Obama himself. I registered a twinge again when watching Frei's Panorama programme, this despite the insulting wrap-round by Jeremy Vine, trying to entice younger viewers by dressing up like a drug dealer (why does the BBC bother?). I was reinforced in my concern that Obama comes across as a highly intelligent chameleon.</p> <p>An ambitious man, his focus has been a far-sighted career strategy which sidestepped predictable paths like the prestigious New York law office (his for the asking) and chose instead never-dull Chicago machine politics. As Palin was seen joking, he's written two biographies, but what else has he actually <em>done</em>?</p> <p>But it wasn't Palin who did the damage, as it struck me. It was educated, mostly black Chicagoans who had watched and, in some instances, nurtured Obama's career. </p> <p>On camera they were conspicuously cool towards him, respectful, measured, polite, but less than warm. One sensed resistance to the calculation which has driven the candidate upwards at a remarkable speed. \"He rang me in hospital,\" recalled one. Not to say, \"how are you?\" but, \"I'm going to run for president.\"</p> <p>A white reporter came away infatuated until his wife deconstructed a host of evasive, contradictory answers. Little girls interviewed on the street, white Democratic activists, moved by Obama's extraordinary personal story and undoubted charisma, his brilliant campaign, were much more enthusiastic. </p> <p>No candidate is a hero to his political valet, the old saw goes. Fair enough, but people who worked for Tony Blair or Margaret Thatcher \u2013 neither shrinking violets \u2013 generally liked them. Panorama reinforced that sense of distance, of effortless elitism, of being the smartest guy in the room. Americans like to like their leaders as well as respect them.</p> <p>Well, I'm not there, not stuck into the campaign day by day. Plenty of people who are there remain convinced that McCain \u2013 who pulled out of swing state Michigan the other day \u2013 is poised to lose badly: hence his bid for defeat with dignity. </p> <p>The polls reinforce this judgment. And let's face it, if a Democrat can't beat the rabble the Republican White House and Congress has become in 2008 then he doesn't deserve to win.</p> <p>We'll see. But if no one prepares Democratic voters for the possibility of defeat \u2013 by fair means or foul \u2013 then they will wake up angry and dismayed on November 5. With a recession in full sway a controversial election like 2000 will strain the republic's institutional strength at a time when it has taken a prolonged beating. </p> <p>It's their election to decide, not ours, but it will dismay us foreigners too. If Obama wins, we have little idea what he will do or how he will govern. And the sniper will still be lurking out there. But America's foreign friends will at least envisage the possibility of long-overdue change. Its enemies will be silenced.</p> <p>A 72-year-old with skin cancer, a bad temper and a hockey mum waiting a heartbeat away on the bench, now that's frightening.</p>",
  "<p><strong>October 13 session</strong></p> <p><strong>42 day pre-charge detention</strong><br>Plans to increase pre-charge terror detention from 28 to 42 days will be dropped from the counter-terrorism bill after a crushing Lords defeat, the home secretary, Jacqui Smith, announced. </p> <p>She said the measure will instead be the subject of a separate piece of legislation to be brought before parliament if required.</p> <p>Flanked by the prime minister, she said in an emergency statement: \"Some may take the security of Britain lightly - I don't.\" The counter-terrorism temporary provisions bill stood ready to be introduced \"if and when the need arises\".</p> <p>Earlier the Lords rejected government's plans for a 42-day limit by 309 votes to 118. Lord Dear, former chief inspector of constabulary, moved the amendment to bar any extension beyond 28 days. He said: \"This attempt to appear tough on terrorism, I believe, is a shabby charade which is unworthy of a democratic process and we should reject it.\"</p> <p><strong>Cash injection for banks</strong><br>The chancellor, Alistair Darling, defended the dramatic cash injection for the banks as a \"significant step\" to restoring confidence in the system. He said the measures were \"essential to stabilise the financial system and help the UK economy\".</p> <p>Darling stressed the need for governments to work together to counter the crisis, insisting it was increasingly clear the package formed \"the basis of an international consensus on the right response to these events\". </p> <p>MPs cheered disclosure that there would be no bonuses this year for board members of banks seeking multi billion pound cash injections - HBOS, Lloyds TSB and RBS.</p> <p>The shadow chancellor, George Osborne, agreed the bank rescue was the \"only option\" available to the country but warned taxpayers were in no mood to celebrate the \"painful end to the age of irresponsibility\".</p> <p><strong>Landsbanki</strong><br>The Bank of England is providing a loan of \u00a3100m to Icelandic bank Landsbanki to help maximise payouts to UK creditors, Darling announced today.</p> <p><strong>Peter Mandleson</strong><br>The business secretary, Peter Mandelson, took his Lords seat as Baron Mandelson of Foy in the county of Herefordshire and Hartlepool in the county of Durham. He will be known simply as Lord Mandelson. Wearing the traditional ermine-lined scarlet robes, he swore allegiance to the Queen in a short ceremony.</p> <p><strong>Missing data</strong><br>A computer hard drive reported missing last week by an IT firm contracted to the defence ministry may have contained personal information on 1.7 million people, armed forces minister Bob Ainsworth disclosed. He said information on the disk, which went missing at the EDS site in Hook, Hampshire, was \"unlikely\" to have been encrypted.</p> <p>Ainsworth said the disk drive had been used with the military training administration and financial management information system (Tafmis) and \"may, in the worst case, contain details relating to 1.7 million individuals who have enquired about joining the armed forces\".</p> <p><strong>Tony Blair</strong><br>Speaker Michael Martin pledged to look into reports that former prime minister Tony Blair \"deliberately misled\" parliament. Tories John Maples and Peter Luff said documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act revealed that in 1997 Blair personally intervened to secure Formula One's exemption from a tobacco advertising ban just hours after meeting the sport's boss, Bernie Ecclestone.</p> <p>Martin asked the two MPs to write to him so that his officials could look into the matter. He said: \"I am deeply concerned that two honourable members have said they were deliberately misled. And albeit that the person concerned is out of the house, I am deeply concerned about that matter.\"</p> <p><strong>New academy schools</strong><br>The schools secretary, Ed Balls, announced plans for three more schools to be transformed into academies. They are Unity College, Northamptonshire - to be sponsored by the Church of England diocese, Rossmore School, Poole - to be sponsored by the local diocese and Bournemouth University and St Lukes, Portsmouth - to be sponsored by the charity ARK, supported by the Church of England diocese.</p> <p><strong>Lord Adonis</strong><br>Balls said he tried to persuade Lord Adonis, architect of the government's education reforms, to stay in his department. He added that Lord Adonis moved to the transport department because he \"wanted a new challenge\". His comments came as Tory Graham Stuart (Beverley and Holderness) said: \"You may have been envious of the success and the cross-party support enjoyed by the architect of the academies programme, Lord Adonis. But was that really reason enough to force him out?\"</p> <p><strong>Human rights</strong><br>Reforms of major international organisations are needed to promote and maintain democracy and human rights throughout the world, Europe minister Caroline Flint said. The UK will work to make changes to the UN and the European court of human rights as part of its dedication to democratic values, she told MPs.</p> <p><strong>Gurkhas</strong><br>A Bill that would allow more Gurkhas to remain in the UK after they are discharged from the British army cleared the Lords, watched from the public gallery by actress Joanna Lumley. Last month a high court judge ruled the government's immigration policy that excludes some Gurkhas was unlawful and in need of urgent review.</p> <p>Lord Brett, for the government, said: \"In light of the ruling of the court, urgent action is being taken to publish new guidance and to review all cases outstanding by the end of the year.\"</p> <p><strong>First world war veterans</strong><br>The surviving first world war veterans have been invited to take part in a ceremony to mark the 90th anniversary of the signing of the armistice, veterans minister Kevan Jones announced. It was hoped the veterans would lay a wreath during a service on November 11, exactly 90 years after the guns fell silent in the trenches.</p> <p><strong>Sexually transmitted infections</strong><br>A sexual \"free for all\" among young people is leading to serious public health problems, Tory former minister Robert Key (Salisbury) warned. He said young adults were engaging in alcohol-fuelled sex, leading to increasing levels of sexually transmitted infections. Children's minister Beverley Hughes said: \"I certainly agree that for a minority of young people this is a problem and I think we have got to take it seriously and we are doing.\"</p>",
  "<p>An initiative has been sweeping the police forces of England and Wales in the past 18 months, rather enterprisingly and ominously called <a href=\"http://www.cleveland.police.uk/news_resources/press_releases/080128_TooMuchBling.htm\">Too Much Bling? Give Us a Ring</a>. The campaign is aimed at encouraging covetous members of the public to report their friends and neighbours for living the high-life without any obviously visible means of support. Heard an unsubstantiated rumour that the chap with the Lexus three doors down is claiming income support? Let us know and we will use the <a href=\"http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2002/ukpga_20020029_en_1\">Proceeds of Crime Act 2002</a> to investigate them and, if there is evidence that their gains are ill-gotten, strip them down to their underwear and turf their children out into the street.</p> <p>Were I writing this piece for any other media organ, this revelation might provoke street parties and hastily-convened denunciation committees, but it is worth considering the implications of such a strategy. Up until now, these undoubtedly useful provisions have been used post-conviction to systematically impoverish career criminals by way of seizure orders.</p> <p>Now, the act is being used to instigate financial investigations against those who may have thus far managed to evade police attention, obviously without their knowledge in the first instance. The very minimum that would be required to substantiate a tip-off would presumably be a check with the benefits office and enquiries into the subject's employment status. If the allegations were discovered to be unfounded, then that person might never be any the wiser that the police had taken an interest in their assets, but the fact still remains that intelligence has been generated in their name based on little more than the status envy of a neighbour or acquaintance.</p> <p>Of course there is more to this than simply asking members of the public to perform their civic duty \u2013 what about the money? The Home Office have <a href=\"http://press.homeoffice.gov.uk/press-releases/proceeds-of-crime-acts-rewarded?version=1\"> earmarked 50%</a> of the proceeds of any investigation for use by the police force that seized it. Despite the fact that the police are facing a \u00a33 bn shortfall in funding over the coming year, New Labour is still only too keen to cite the fact that they have recruited 14,000 extra police officers since 1997 (albeit with scarcely any impact whatsoever on visible street presence). Given that over 80% of any force budget is spent on wages alone, it is obvious where the current shortfalls will be met. If the police continue to rely on the Treasury coffers to fund them through an increasingly likely recession, it is quite conceivable that Gordon Brown and Jacqui Smith will have returned the service to the position in which it was inherited by the time the next election is called.</p> <p>Essentially, the police are asking the public to provide funding by shopping their neighbours and the Home Office, ever keen to publish detailed performance league tables, seem willing to push forces into the uncomfortable position of prioritising investigations based on their asset-recovery potential rather than the relative moral desirability of a prosecution. Drug users, who tend to smoke or inject their assets as soon as they obtain them, will represent poor value for money compared to the average two-bit millionaire with his flashy jewellery.</p> <p>It is worth noting that assets need only total \u00a31,000 and be unaccountable to initiate a seizure order. That's about the price of decent HD flatscreen or budget used car, so the quite reasonable argument that it will encourage the police to target the dealers rather than the users does not necessarily hold \u2013 there are any number of ways to illegally enrich oneself that might not make it onto the public's checklist of priorities. </p> <p>At the very least, it is worth asking how many innocent people will end up on intelligence databases for the crime of \"ostentatious display of wealth\".</p>",
  "<p><strong>1) Brazil 1982</strong></p> <p>If scoring a goal is <a href=\"http://bleacherreport.com/articles/16561-scoring-a-goal-better-than-sex\">comparable with having sex</a>, then the Brazil 1982 side are the greatest porn you will ever see. Debbie Does Dallas, for example, has nothing on <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxqcwH4lTtM\">Socrates does Seville</a>. Brazil produced simply the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5AH-jdNhxE&amp;feature=related\">greatest portfolio</a> of goals in existence. Which one's your favourite? There were 15 in five games, and at least 12 had unimpeachable aesthetic merit \u2014 or, to put in the parlance of the time, did you effing well see what Socrates/Eder/Junior/Zico/Falcao/Serginho just did there? (No, we didn't really mean to include Serginho who, for the uninitiated, was the club-footed lummox who led the line after an injury to Careca. <em>And they still scored an average of three goals per game with him in the team</em>.) </p> <p>Anyway, this was <em>jogo bonito</em> in excelsis. The visionary bequiffed balladeer Nick Berry may have been wrong when he said that <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TagURmwO0Xs\"><em>every</em> loser wins</a>, but he was certainly right about this Brazil side, who are justly more celebrated than the World Cup winners of 1994 and maybe 2002. The manager Tel\u00ea Santana produced a side whose offensive movements were as smooth as Telly Savalas's pate. <br> Personal favourites are that Socrates long-ranger in the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czFlRz29TNI\">2-1 win over the USSR</a>, aptly described as a \"heatseeker\" in Cris Freddi's wonderful <a href=\" http://www.amazon.co.uk/Complete-Book-World-Cris-Freddi/dp/000722916X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1223631142&amp;sr=8-1\">World Cup history</a>, and Junior's 50-yard one-two with Zico that helped <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4TC4vnKtw\">utterly humiliate Argentina</a>. They also <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Tk3LY6A6Cs\">mutilated Scotland 4-1</a> and New Zealand 4-0, before paying the price for a hideous defence (the goalkeeper, Waldir Peres, was a particularly unfunny joke; watch the way he ushers in the USSR goal like someone letting another person off a tube) in that legendary <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTfPOzUc1JI\">3-2 defeat to Italy</a>. With Poland and a limited West Germany to come, this was basically the World Cup final. Italy won the thing but, well, big whoop-whoop: in many ways this remains Brazil's tournament. Then again, if they <em>had</em> won it, they would be remembered as even greater than Brazil 70. <br> <strong> 2) Jimmy White (1984-1994)</strong> </p> <p>The idea of the streetwise bottler is as paradoxical as that of the hirsute foetus, the listless orgasm or the insomnia-inducing episode of The Wire, but that's how history will record Jimmy White. Though obscenely talented and able to work the baize as absent-mindedly as a model does the camera or an alcoholic the top shelf, White could never nail the big one: the World Championship. To compound his misery \u2013 and that of his legions of fans \u2013 he usually lost in the final to his polar opposite, a villainously efficient pair of pantomime bastards called Stephen Hendry and Steve Davis. </p> <p>They accounted for five of White's six World Championship final losses, five of which came in a row from 1990 to 1994. And while it makes for a romantic bittersweet story that White consistently choked, the mundane reality is that, for the most part, he simply lost to a better player, particularly when Hendry obliterated him 18-5 in 1993. The 1992 final, when White led 14-8 only to lose 18-14, is often cited, but really that owed most to Hendry's dead-eyed certainty. </p> <p>There is one exception: White's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/may/06/snooker.features\">self-confessed twitch</a> on the black in the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TY2pZe3g2Y\">deciding frame of the 1994 final</a>, when his miss \u2013 described at the time by the BBC commentator Dennis Taylor as \"a pot that he would never miss in 100 years\" \u2013 let Hendry in for a ruthless, match-sealing break of 58. Man reacts in myriad ways to missing a crucial black. Francis Begbie flicked his pool cue upside down and introduced it to a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyNjNddUenI\">specky wee gadge</a>; poor White just sat there with the look of someone being forced to watch his loved one kiss someone else, his eyelids gently magnetising in a moment of undiluted solemnity. </p> <p><strong>3) Kent CCC (1992-1997)</strong> <br> As well as providing the most cringeworthy moment of the Cool Britannia era, which is quite an achievement, D:Ream's signature song Things Can Only Get Better was actually a big lie. Sometimes, however bad things are, they can get worse. Ask any Kent cricket fan. After losing three cup finals out of three in the 1980s, all by gossamer-thin margins, Kent already had a reputation as county cricket's bridesmaids. In the 1990s they went a stage further: they played the role of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1hvP5JwsKs\">Peep Show's Sophie at the altar</a>. Kent were a serious team, with a six-man bowling attack who all played for England and a rugged, battle-hardened top order given plenty of stardust by two of the all-time great overseas players, Carl Hooper and Aravinda de Silva. But they simply ballsed it up time after time. <br> In 1992 they lost to Hampshire in the Benson &amp; Hedges final and were runners-up in the Championship; in 1993 they lost a winner-takes-all decider in the Sunday League at home to Glamorgan, in part thanks to the latest no-ball call in history to reprieve Viv Richards, a decision that emphatically had nothing to do with the fact that Richards was playing his final game; in 1994 they went out of both cup competitions to Warwickshire, once in a bowl-out and once after being in total control of a semi-final before Dermot Naffing Reeve imposed his wonderful mental strength all over the contest and Kent fell apart; in 1995 they lost the B&amp;H final to Lancashire, despite De Silva playing <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTgAOIwTnwk\"> one of the most charming and poignant (OK, provided you're from Kent), innings</a> ever played at Lord's.</p> <p>That year they did win the Sunday League, their first trophy for 17 years, but even that was almost overshadowed by the fact they finished bottom of the Championship. And then, in 1997, we - sorry, <em>they</em> - finished second in <em>three</em> competitions:, the Championship (which they led with two games to go only to bugger a run-chase in <a href=\"http://uk.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1997/ENG_LOCAL/CC/R19/YORKS_KENT_CC_10-13SEP1997.html\">a minor classic against Yorkshire</a>), the Sunday League (which they led going into the final game only to lose to Yorkshire) and the B&amp;H final yet again. Still, at least they've reversed the trend in the 00s, eh? Oh. Gah! <br> <strong>4) New Zealand (1995-2007)</strong> <br> Never mind the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1ZGvnGTn0U&amp;feature=related\"><em>silencio</em> bit</a> in Mulholland Drive; if David Lynch <em>really</em> wanted to freak out an audience, particularly in New Zealand, he could simply have a talking dwarf (played by, say, George Gregan), repeating the phrase <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65xd81cj7pA\">\"four more years, boys, four more years\"</a>. <br> It would certainly wobble the spine of any All Black who has participated in the last four World Cups \u2013 in all of which New Zealand were arguably the best and certainly the most watchable team. That they have not won the tournament since 1987, and not even reached the final on the past three occasions, is utterly bewildering for a team who ritually wipe the floor and plenty else with allcomers between tournaments. </p> <p>The New Zealand legend, strong enough as <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVxmC7yLfYQ&amp;feature=related\">Jonah Lomu ran amok</a> in 1995, has simply grown with each failed venture, thereby provoking an internal Haka in their opponents, who have been roused to hitherto uncharted peaks of performance. In <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9P2ciVXzX8\">1995</a>, 2003 and sort of in <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF-axOHtoTA&amp;feature=related\">2007</a>, they were exposed to the unique intensity in evidence when the home nation is both a superpower and underdog. In 1995 they also had to contend with a <a href=\"http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5727571184344259601\">sinister case of food poisoning</a>, and in 2007 with some stomach-churningly bad refereeing. And in 1999 they were on the wrong end of one of the most <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdXqtYVynRU\">zanily inspired passages of play</a> in sporting history. That's some collision of misfortune, and it makes for a legitimate excuse. But hearing, \"It's not you, it's us\" isn't really going to comfort an All Black. Still, it's preferable to hearing a gladiatorial little man yapping, \"Four more years, boys, four more years.\" </p> <p><strong>5) Liverpool FC (1994-97)</strong></p> <p>Spot the difference between these two footballing examples. <br> 1) A professorial French manager produces the most aesthetically appealing team in the league, a collection of burgeoning talents whose intuitive pass-and-move game is a visceral and intellectual delight. They win nothing because of an inherent mental fragility that leads them to famously bottle a title race, but the quality of their play means that the manager is lauded as one of the greats of his profession.  2) A homespun English manager produces the most aesthetically appealing football team in the league, a collection of burgeoning talents whose intuitive pass-and-move game is a visceral and intellectual delight. They win nothing except a League Cup because of an inherent mental fragility that leads them to famously bottle a title race; their manager is seen as a bit of a clown as a result and is eventually shunted aside to make way for a professorial French manager.</p> <p>Roy Evans had his flaws, undeniably, but his Liverpool team could make for sublime viewing, and \u2013 as has been argued more extensively in this <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2007/feb/15/onsecondthoughtsroyevans\">On Second Thoughts piece</a> \u2013 he deserves a bit more respect. If he wasn't English, he'd surely have got it.</p> <p><strong>6) South Africa (1999)</strong> </p> <p>It's often said that a team can peak too early in a cricket World Cup, given the gruelling nature of the campaign, but no one had any such concerns when South Africa were pummeling allcomers at the start of the 1999 World Cup. They had been sprinting the marathon for years: under the progressive coaching of Bob Woolmer this hyper-efficient side had taken one-day cricket to another level, winning a staggering 40 of their previous 50 one-day games going into the Super Six clash with Australia. </p> <p>They had a remorseless, relentless seam attack and a splendidly varied batting line-up who, nonetheless, were really just killing time before the irresistible thuggery of Lance Klusener. (In that World Cup, and it really is worth reminding ourselves of this, Klusener averaged 140.50 with the bat, at a strike-rate of 122.17, and sometimes batted as low as No9.) In short, they were a machine \u2013 but they were a machine with blood, with a brain, with anima. And that, given a combination of their upright, uptight nature, a fatalism about the World Cup and an asphyxiating inferiority complex against Australia, engendered a couple of unforgettable errors. <br> The first was Herschelle Gibbs' premature celebration in the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mqwriv538UY\">Super Six game</a> against the Aussies, and the second came from Lance Klusener and Allan Donald, their <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDx4KVwfQy0\">brains overheating</a> in that <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BeSh5Ff79k&amp;feature=related\">astonishing climax</a> to the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gkl2r77voYg&amp;feature=related\">semi-final against Australia</a>. There's a legitimate argument that no side has ever played better one-day cricket than South Africa in the late 1990s; there's no argument at all that no side has played worse one-day cricket than in those fateful seconds at the end. Even now it beggars belief. And the moment Donald's body became stuck in cement, South Africa's reputation as chokers became set in stone.</p>",
  "<p>As the banking system lies in a state of self-induced paralysis and governments around the world struggle to minimise the impact of the fallout on the real economy, lessons on the crisis can be learned from an unlikely psychological study conducted over 40 years ago.</p> <p>In the 1960s a researcher at Stanford University called <a href=\"http://www.columbia.edu/cu/psychology/indiv_pages/mischel.html\">Walter Mischel</a> carried out an <a href=\"http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2007/10/stanford_marshm.html\">experiment</a> on a group of four-year-olds. Mischel offered the children one marshmallow immediately, or two if they could wait until his return to the room 20 minutes later. Some of the children ate their marshmallow instantly while others held on a little longer before losing patience. About a third held out and they were duly rewarded with a second marshmallow.</p> <p>Those children who waited for Mischel's return had demonstrated an ability to control their impulses, to delay gratification. According to the psychologist, they had exhibited qualities key to future success and happiness. In the years that followed, researchers found that those children who had waited for their second marshmallow were almost universally more positive, self-motivated, and successful in their studies than their contemporaries. The lesson teaches us the benefits of impulse control, of looking beyond the present to take into account our longer-term interests. What is gratifying in the present is not necessarily the best course of action to take.</p> <p>Now consider the case of the former boss of Lehman Brothers, <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/lists/2008/12/lead_bestbosses08_Richard-S-Fuld-Jr_A9P0.html\">Richard S Fuld Jr</a>. In the early years of the century, Fuld presided over an institution that made large amounts of money by investing heavily in securities linked to the US mortgage market. Yet when the sub-prime crisis began to unfold, it quickly became clear that Lehman's house was built on shaky foundations. The debt on which it had profited was toxic and an institution that had survived the Great Depression was <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7615974.stm\">no more</a>. The bank's management had sought short-term profitability without regard for the wider consequences. Yet what is even more remarkable is that Fuld was rewarded for this lack of foresight. During his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/06/creditcrunch.lehmanbrothers\">congressional hearing</a>, he admitted taking home $60m in cash and close to $250m in stocks as he led the company to bankruptcy. The case is clearly not unique.</p> <p>As the extent of mismanagement in the banking sector becomes clear, the culture of City bonuses has come into sharp focus. The huge financial incentives offered to those who pulled in large but now illusory profits have encouraged employees to turn a blind eye to the long-term stability of the firms in which they worked. Bankers have been rewarded for the same impulsiveness that Mischel identified in his four-year-old subjects as a barrier to success. The industry has institutionalised modes of behaviour that in all other walks of life are considered harmful. The result has brought the banks to their knees and is now playing havoc with the wider economy.</p> <p>Criticism of the banking sector has reached unprecedented heights in recent days. The leaders of all the main political parties have called for irresponsible banking chiefs to be punished. Yet while Whitehall's rancour is justified, it is also disingenuous. The current crisis has its roots in Thatcher's sudden deregulation of the financial sector in the 1980s, and may be the inevitable conclusion of the policies implemented by both Labour and Conservative governments since then. By turning City-boys into whipping-boys, politicians are desperately trying to divert public attention from their own failed economic policies.</p> <p>Nevertheless, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/09/banking.executivesalaries\">sweeping rescue package</a> unveiled by Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling last week must be welcomed. On top of the huge sums set aside to increase the capital and liquidity of the financial firms taking part are plans to subject the sector to greater scrutiny. The Financial Services Authority, we are told, will assume the role it has been denied in recent years, keeping a lid on executive pay and curbing bonuses. If successful, the scheme would not only unclog the furred arteries of finance, but put a stop to the impulsive \"get paid now, pay later\" culture prevalent in the City. Let's hope the newly invigorated financial regulators seize the opportunity. Our future prosperity lies in their hands.</p>",

Millions of new voters have registered this year, many of them from traditionally disenfranchised groups: the poor, the young, and people of color. A majority of these new voters are clearly fall into the Obama camp, so the GOP has mounted a campaign to root out what it claims is widespread voter fraud.</p> <p>They claim that people are registering to vote multiple times, or under false names, or in the wrong jurisdictions, or are not entitled to vote (for example, because they are have no home address or are undocumented immigrants or convicted felons). </p> <p>As the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/16/opinion/16fri1.html\">New York Times put it in an editorial last year</a>, \"In partisan Republican circles, the pursuit of voter fraud is code for suppressing the votes of minorities and poor people.\" <a href=\"http://projectvote.org/index.php?id=265&amp;tx_ttnews[tt_news]=2601&amp;tx_ttnews[backPid]=263&amp;cHash=981996ec36\">The myth of voter fraud</a> is a powerful tool to combat the expansion of Obama's voting base. And the tactic is clearly alive and well in Nevada, where the following stories emerged in the past week alone:</p> <p>1) Last Tuesday, members of the new \"Election Integrity Task Force,\" under the leadership of Nevada's Secretary of State Ross Miller (a Democrat, by the way), <a href=\"http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2008/oct/07/acorn-office-vegas-raided-voter-fraud-probe/\">raided the Las Vegas office of the ACORN</a>, the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, which has registered thousands of low-income people. They seized eight computers and twenty boxes of documents, citing allegations of fraudulent registrations made by ACORN. \"We've been told that some of the allegedly erroneous applications even included the names of players from the Dallas Cowboys football team,\" Miller said. It's no surprise that ACORN's work is under scrutiny: They have registered more than 100,000 new voters in Nevada alone. </p> <p>2) In Washoe County, so many Democrats have registered to vote that the two party's numbers are now virtually even where Republicans once had a sizable lead. In response, the <a href=\"http://rgj.com/article/20081009/NEWS19/81009043&amp;OAS_sitepage=news.rgj.com/breakingnews\">local Republican Party is disputing</a> what it claims may be fraudulent registrations. In an obvious reference to the ACORN case, country GOP chair Heidi Smith declared last Thursday: \"We're going to request a list of all registered Democrats to check for all the Dallas Cowboys and 49ers and any 'Sherwin Williams' or anything out of the ordinary.\" Smith said she was disputing the registrations after receiving numerous complaints from Republican voters who had received flawed registration cards. The Washoe County Registrar, however, said he had received no reports of voter card errors. </p> <p>For more examples, vote suppression tactics in Nevada are being tracked on some local blogs, including <a href=\"http://desertbeacon.blogspot.com/search/label/Vote%20Suppression\">Desert Beacon</a>, and <a href=\"http://zekesaysso.blogspot.com/\">Zeke Says So</a>.</p>"
