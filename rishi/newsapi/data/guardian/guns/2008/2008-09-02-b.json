  "<p>I recently spent some time in the north-west of Scotland with a 10-year-old friend of mine. I've known Katie since she was a couple of months old, and it's fair to say we've always hit it off. On the wall of her bedroom is a picture of a younger me, shaven-headed, cradling a younger Katie fresh from the bath. It was the summer after I left the day hospital. On the backs of my hands, if you look very closely, you can just make out the scars of cigarette burns, shockingly incongruous against the soft white of the towel and the laughing baby wriggling inside it.</p> <p>Because we live so far from each other I seldom see Katie more than twice a year, and she seems to grow in a series of steps. I remember her learning to walk, one hand on the back of my adoring dog, the same dog who, a year or two later, would repeatedly visit \"vet\" Katie to have her ears examined and her legs wrapped in imaginary bandages.</p> <p>I remember Katie sporting a scarlet sweatshirt, ready for her first day at school - and the hour we had to allow for the walk so Katie could stroke each piece of moss she found along the way; I remember the honour I felt at being invited to visit her (not very) secret den; the endless games of hide-and-seek in the woods by her house, and my wonder at how this tiny creature could control me so completely.</p> <p>When I think of Katie she is always outside, because that's where she usually is - climbing in the mountains, playing rugby on the beach, being held by the ankles and dipped, at her own insistence, head-first in a fast-flowing river. Her lifestyle is so different from that of the children who live around me in London that I am repeatedly struck by the gulf between them, the shockingly random roll of the dice that dictates where we each end up. While Katie goes to a small village school with two years to every class, my 10-year-old London neighbour attends a pupil referral unit (\"The Pru\"), was recently arrested for mugging an elderly woman, and now faces, with her family, her third successive eviction.</p> <p>The one certainty in both their lives is that girls don't stay girls forever: they turn into women. While childhood - at least a happy childhood - is full of the joys of unselfconscious \"being\", in adolescence we start to measure the person we feel we are against the person we feel we should be. Though both of these measurements fluctuate constantly, the distance between them is likely to have the greatest possible impact on our levels of self-acceptance and contentment.</p> <p>Our image of who we should be is influenced by many factors, but for girls the cultural perception of \"the ideal woman\" is of enormous importance. I've so long grown accustomed to the gaping chasm that divides us, I seldom give this mythical being much thought, but for teenagers, even for 10-year-olds, it seems hard to avoid the impact of her constant, critical scrutiny. </p> <p>Mythical Woman does not exist. Though she stares coldly out from magazines, stalks across our TV screens in all her stick-thin perfection, Mythical Woman cannot exist. For were she to do so, billion dollar industries would collapse in the twinkling of a (long-lashed) eye. One might say the whole point of Mythical Woman is to stay just beyond our reach. Her power lies in our dissatisfaction.</p> <p>And powerful she certainly is, especially for adolescent girls. It was Mythical Woman, I suspect, who instructed Katie to take a tape measure and wrap it around her 10-year-old thigh, a process her mother happened to walk in on. It was Mythical Woman who prompted her to take out a hairbrush on top of a 3,000ft mountain.</p> <p>But her impact is not just physical, for Mythical Woman also wrinkles her nose at many of Katie's favourite occupations. When I went in to say goodnight, Katie proudly showed me her penknife, a gadget with so many tools you could probably build a house with it. Stamped across the handle was the logo \"BoyzToyz\". \"But I don't really care,\" said Katie, reddening slightly.</p> <p><strong> \u00b7 </strong>Names and some details have been changed.

  "<p>A couple of weeks ago, Gary Glitter (real name Paul Francis Gadd) was deported from Vietnam after serving a two-and-half year prison sentence for sexually abusing young girls. He had fled Britain nine years earlier, after a two-month sentence for the possession of more than 4,000 images of child pornography.</p> <p>Despite the length and breadth of his subsequent off ending career, the apparent ineffectiveness of his brief first sentence hardly rated a mention. Yet just days after his deportation, Scotland Yard issued a stark warning. The escalating problem of child abuse is a far greater threat to society than previously assumed, it said, with \"huge\" numbers of paedophiles now scouring the internet.</p> <p>Since 1998, internet crime involving the sexual exploitation of children has risen by more than 400%. So too has the increase in downloading, possessing and trading/distributing child pornography. Ever more sophisticated technologies have facilitated illegal online activities, while making it easier for users to avoid detection. As a result, illegal material can move faster and in significantly greater quantities than ever before. And it is a highly profitable business: commercial child pornography was estimated two years ago to be a $20bn industry worldwide.</p> <p>Yet it is not only the quantity that is disturbing. There is also the increasingly extreme nature of the material itself, as reported in the Internet Watch Foundation's (IWF) study earlier this year. It is estimated, for example, that 10% of the child victims used in such crimes are under two years old, a further 80% are under 10. Detectives for the Child Exploitation Online Protection centre are uncovering growing evidence that paedophiles are concentrating more and more on pre- verbal victims. Child pornography, as Ernie Allen, president of the National Centre for Missing &amp; Exploited Children in the US, said recently, has become \"a global crisis\".</p> <p>Child sex offenders are usually habitual fantasists. They are prone to distorted thinking: dissembling and deceit go with the territory. And it seems they are particularly skilled at disowning and evading responsibility, a trait prevalent among sexual abusers generally. Partly as a result of this, less is known about online child pornographers and their treatment than almost any other group of offenders. And even less is known about the correlation between the use of pornography and hands-on offences. So despite some recognised advances in policing and containment recently, this lack of empirical knowledge is thwarting the professionals who seek to tackle the problem. The damage, meanwhile, continues to escalate.</p> <p>In an attempt to gain some insight, psychologists conducted a study two years ago at the Federal Correctional Institution in America. Michael L Bourke and Andres E Hernandez compared two groups of men taking part in a voluntary treatment programme for sex off enders at a medium security prison. All 155 had been sentenced for the possession, distribution or receipt of child-abuse images. Only 40 of these men were known to have committed any hands-on sexual offences previously, averaging 1.88 victims each. The remaining men claimed never to have committed any such offences: their activities, they said, had been restricted to the viewing of images.</p> <p>But after participating in an 18-month intensive therapeutic programme, a very different picture emerged. It was a picture that not only belied the normal, law-abiding lives depicted by most of these men prior to their arrest, but one that also contrasted starkly with the frequent assertion that child pornography off enders are \"only\" involved with images.</p> <p><strong>Shock findings </strong></p> <p>After the treatment it emerged that the number of men admitting to hands-on sexual abuse increased from 40 to 131. Their average number of disclosed victims rose to 13.56 (8.7 for the 115 men who had previously denied any offences). Overall, the number of admitted contact sexual offences increases by 2,369%.</p> <p>Far from being innocent or sexually \"curious\" bystanders whose interest was reserved to internet images, the vast majority of these men emerged as hands on offenders with longstanding sexual interest. Not only were they significantly likely to have sexually abused more than one child, they were also likely to have experimented with both genders, and a variety of age groups.</p> <p>The remaining 24 men were offered a lie detector test; some of them refused. Only two of these men passed, both of whom admitted that with continued opportunity and online access they would have been in danger of molesting a child. Perhaps this should not surprise us. Among other things, online communities provide marginalised individuals with a feeling of solidarity, while at the same time maintaining the illusion of anonymity. Fertile grounds, you might think, for the awakening of any dormant or repressed sexual fantasies. Indeed, perhaps the act of repression creates its own vulnerability, rendering such individuals more susceptible to external triggers.</p> <p>It would be rash to infer from these findings that the internet causes contact sexual crimes. But the research puts paid to the notion that the desire to view images is easily distinguishable from the desire to act them out. And they also corroborate what prior research has shown. The manifestations of deviant sexual arousal are seldom limited to fantasy. It is opportunity more than anything that dictates how many internet off enders also rape and molest children.</p> <p>What is beyond doubt is the insidious harm caused. Child abuse images both dehumanise children and desensitise offenders, and child/adult sexuality is normalised in the process. Yet it seems likely that such a highly profitable business will not suffer exposure easily, nor welcome close scrutiny. The above survey was among the first of its kind in the US, and doubtless proved discomfiting to many. It has yet to be published. Those experts who have seen it say privately that it could have enormous implications, both for law enforcement and public safety.</p> <p>What is becoming apparent is that the internet has opened the way for new types of off ending. The real issue is not whether viewing these images will make someone a paedophile - a label liable to vast misunderstandings. The real danger is that those who do so will be encouraged to re offend - and that the proliferation of online child abuse images will increase, dramatically, the incidence of child abuse.</p> <p>As the IWF has stated, there is urgent need for \" a coordinated global attack on these websites \". This is undoubtedly so. But as Bourke and Hernandez' report shows, our lack of awareness in this area is very dangerous. Particularly, it seems, when it comes to our knowledge of sex off enders. If nothing else, Glitter's case shows that his initial prison sentence achieved little apart from delaying the next onslaught. Clearly a more enlightened approach towards the treatment of victims and off enders is not only long overdue but vital.</p> <p>This dark underbelly of society has fed on our ignorance for too long. And it is only through addressing why these things happen, as well as how to stop them, that we might shrink its appetite. This untold damage needs telling. </p> <p><strong> \u00b7 </strong>Philippa Ibbotson is a professional musician and freelance writer.</p>",

  "<p>On 16 June this year, Del Martin, who has died aged 87, married Phyllis Lyon, her lover of more than 50 years, in San Francisco. California had just become the second US state, after Massachusetts, to legalise gay marriage. This was something Del and Phyllis had been working towards together since the 1950s. Soon after they started stepping out in 1953, they came out, co-founding America's first lesbian campaign group, the Daughters of Bilitis, and its first lesbian magazine, the Ladder.</p> <p>Del and Phyllis had married each other for the first time in February 2004, when the mayor of San Francisco, Gavin Newsom, allowed marriage licences to be issued to same-sex couples in defiance of state law. But the California supreme court soon nullified their union and around 4,000 others. Del and Phyllis were key plaintiffs in the lawsuit that led to the court overturning the ban on gay marriage in May. Newsom chose Del and Phyllis to be the first same-sex couple to be married in San Francisco after the new ruling, in recognition of their iconic status and their decades of activism.</p> <p>Born Dorothy Taliaferro in San Francisco in 1921, Del was educated at George Washington high school and the University of California, Berkeley. She went on to study journalism at San Francisco state college. When she was 19 she married a man, James Martin, and they had a daughter, Kendra.</p> <p>Del met Phyllis in Seattle in 1950 when they were working as journalists on a construction trade publication. The more confident Phyllis helped draw Del out of the closet. By 1953 she had left her husband, and the couple moved into a flat together in San Francisco.</p> <p>In 1955 they co-founded the Daughters of Bilitis, named after a fictional lover of Sappho and originally a social group for lesbians in San Francisco with a membership of eight. They wanted a place to meet, talk and dance, free from harassment - this would usually be someone's living-room. Del was elected the first president.</p> <p>It evolved into a campaigning group, working on law reform, research, and education, both of lesbians and of the wider public, about homosexuality. The FBI monitored early meetings. The police attended its first conference in 1960, to check that delegates were not wearing men's clothes, then still a criminal offence. By the mid-1960s, the Daughters of Bilitis had chapters across the US. Banned from advertising in newspapers, the Daughters began publishing the Ladder, which reached out to more isolated women. Phyllis was the first editor, from 1956, then Del took over between 1960 and 1962. In its first issue, Del spelt out a simple manifesto: \"Nothing was ever accomplished by hiding in a dark corner.\"</p> <p>Fearing that the Daughters was becoming too closely identified with them, in 1964 Del and Phyllis moved away from organisational roles. They decided to concentrate instead on winning over and working with other progressives, in the Council on Religion and the Homosexual, and the National Organization of Women; Del was later voted on to its board, as its first out lesbian. She continued to write, including a landmark article condemning lesbophobia in the women's movement and sexism in the gay liberation movement, If That's All There Is, first published in Advocate magazine in 1970.</p> <p>In 1972, Del and Phyllis co-founded the Alice B Toklas Democratic Club, which supported and lobbied pro-gay politicians and electoral candidates. They co-wrote two books, Lesbian/Woman (1972) and Lesbian Love and Liberation (1973). Ever aware of new prejudices to conquer, Del wrote Battered Wives in 1976, and later co-founded Lesbian Mothers' Union and Old Lesbians Organizing for Change.</p> <p>In 1979, the Lyon-Martin health clinic, offering non-judgmental health care to lesbians, was named in their honour. Their 50th anniversary, in 2003, saw the release of Joan E Biren's moving documentary film, No Secret Anymore: the Times of Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon.</p> <p>Del's health had been failing over the last few years, and she attended their wedding in a wheelchair. After her death, Phyllis said: \"I am devastated - but I take some solace in knowing we were able to enjoy the ultimate rite of love and commitment before she passed.\"</p> <p>Del is survived by her wife, and by Kendra. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Dorothy Taliaferro (Del Martin), civil rights activist, born May 5 1921; died August 27 2008</p>",
  "<p>A British soldier in Iraq killed a sleeping comrade by aiming a sniper rifle \"in jest\" at his head without realising the weapon was loaded, a court martial heard yesterday.</p> <p>Rifleman Aaron Kendrick, 20, who is accused of manslaughter, had committed \"the cardinal sin of weapon handling\" when he cocked, aimed and fired the gun, prosecutors said.</p> <p>Edward Vakabua, a 23-year-old Fijian rifleman in the same platoon, was shot in the head as he lay asleep in the barracks inside Saddam Hussein's former palace in Basra on June 6 last year. He received immediate treatment but was pronounced dead soon afterwards. A month before his death Vakabua had saved the life of another soldier injured by mortar fire, volunteering to drive him to a helicopter evacuation site despite the continued attack. Kendrick, of the Wiltshire-based 4th Battalion The Rifles, was not authorised to use the L96 rifle but had taken it from beneath another soldier's bed, Colonel Nigel Jones, prosecuting, told the hearing.</p> <p>\"He picked up the rifle because he was curious, because he was interested in going on a course and qualifying as a sniper. His father was also qualified on this rifle and he wanted to follow in his father's footsteps,\" Jones said. But in aiming the gun and firing a single round at Vakabua, Kendrick \"showed wanton disregard for normal safety precautions, which he, as a trained infantry soldier, was aware of.\" </p> <p>The rifle was shared by two trained snipers in the platoon. One of these, Lance Corporal Frank Taylor, had stored the loaded weapon under his bed for a few minutes while he went to collect more ammunition ahead of an operation. </p> <p>Kendrick, who picked the gun up while Taylor was out of the room, told military police that the rifle should not have been stored with a loaded magazine in it, saying: \"I had that gut instinct it was safe.\"</p> <p>While weapons were not meant to be left loaded inside barracks, the court martial was told that the two snipers regularly left 10-round magazines in their rifle so they were prepared for emergencies. Kendrick admits negligent handling of a weapon, but denies manslaughter. The court martial in Bulford, Wiltshire, continues.</p>",
  "<p>For the first time since the Spanish dictator, Francisco Franco, died in 1975, Spanish authorities are taking action regarding the victims of the regime who still linger in thousands of unmarked graves throughout the country.</p> <p>The high court judge Baltasar Garz\u00f3n, who tried to extradite former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet from Britain and has pursued former Argentine military officers for human rights crimes during its \"dirty war\", has sent an official request to various government archives, the Catholic church, the keepers of Franco's tomb and the Madrid, Granada, Cordoba and Seville city halls for documentation on mass graves from the 1936-1939 Spanish civil war and the subsequent 36-year dictatorship. Garz\u00f3n is asking for victims' names, and the dates and circumstances of their deaths.</p> <p>\"I'm ecstatic,\" said Emilio Silva, founder and head of the non-profit Association for the Recovery of Historical Memory (ARMH), whose volunteer forensics, archaeologists and anthropologists have excavated 120 mass graves containing around 1,200 people over the past eight years. \"This is the first time Spanish authorities have done something like this and it could be the first step towards a truth commission,\" he said</p> <p>The judge's investigation stems from around 1,200 petitions from families and associations asking for information on those who \"disappeared\" between July 1936 and November 1975, when Franco's soldiers often dispatched dissidents during a paseo, a \"stroll\" that ended with a bullet in the head and an unmarked grave.</p> <p>Historians estimate that from the beginning of the civil war between Franco's Nationalists and supporters of the Republic to the dictator's death, Franco's forces killed around 150,000 people and Republicans killed around 60,000, mostly during the war. The regime recovered almost all of the Nationalist dead, but Franco's victims have never received the same treatment. Silva said the people in mass graves could number at least 100,000.</p> <p>Nieves Galindo will join the petitioning Spaniards this week and ask the high court to locate the unmarked grave of her grandfather, Di\u00f3scoro Galindo, a one-legged teacher who was shot by Franco's forces on August 18 1936. Galindo is thought to have been killed and buried alongside the Spanish poet Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca. To date, Lorca's family have opposed his exhumation, but Galindo's request will no doubt prompt a public debate about the mass graves in general.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Garz\u00f3n can assume jurisdiction over the cases only if he finds proof of a nationwide, systematic plan to eliminate the regime's enemies. Individual crimes are handled at a lower court level. Groups such as ARMH have criticised Garz\u00f3n and the government for leaving the work to grassroots organisations.</p> <p>Last year, parliament passed the Historical Memory Law to recognise victims of the Franco regime and to remove Francoist symbols from public places. However, the law offers only vague support concerning the identification and exhumation of graves.</p> <p>Silva said he hopes Garz\u00f3n's investigation forces the government to take responsibility: \"It's shameless that they delegate human rights issues to volunteers.\"</p>",
  "<p>Thailand's army chief yesterday pledged to refrain from using force to break up anti-government protests despite a state of emergency declared hours after one demonstrator was killed and dozens were injured in violent clashes.</p> <p>General Anupong Paojinda adopted the softly-softly approach fearing hard-line measures would create even greater problems. But it left the prime minister, Samak Sundaravej, in an awkward position shortly after he announced the sweeping curbs to civil liberties to maintain calm. Samak empowered the army to restore order on the streets of Bangkok after the fighting between his supporters and those demanding he quit, the worst violence seen since the anti-government campaign began in May.</p> <p>The dramatic announcement came after 400 troops in riot gear were deployed to separate the rival mobs who clashed after police were overwhelmed when the pro-government protesters pushed through their lines.</p> <p>But even after Samak said the state of emergency would last only a \"few days\" there seemed no easy way out of the crisis with the prime minister and his government refusing to step down and the army allied to Thailand's revered king showing little inclination to evict the entrenched anti-government protesters.</p> <p>Samak acted swiftly to declare the state of emergency in an early morning broadcast within a few hours of the violence that left one 55-year-old man dead - reportedly beaten to death with golf clubs - and 43 injured. \"I did it to solve the problems of the country,\" said Samak. \"I had no other choice. The softest means available was an emergency decree to end the situation using the law.\"</p> <p>The emergency order gave the army chief the powers to detain and remove people from any location, deploy soldiers on the streets, censor media reports that could \"undermine public security\", and ban gatherings of more than five people.</p> <p>The prospect of Thailand's army returning to the streets evoked memories of the military coup two years ago that removed Samak's predecessor and ally, Thaksin Shinawatra, who fled to the UK last month to avoid corruption charges.</p> <p>But Gen Anupong, who held his own briefing shortly after the prime minister, ridiculed suggestions that the army was preparing to grab power yet again. He said if troops were deployed to curb violence they would only be armed with shields and batons. </p> <p>\"If we thought we could use police and soldiers to get them out with a peaceful conclusion, we would do it,\" he said. \"But we think that would create more problems.\"</p> <p>Inside the Government House compound occupied a week ago, thousands of Peoples Alliance for Democracy (Pad) demonstrators - clad in yellow shirts to show allegiance to the king - had secured the gates with steel hawser, and helmets, makeshift riot shields and golf clubs lay in piles to repel any attempt to remove them.</p> <p>Outside, barricades of tyres and razor-wire ringed the approach roads. Helmeted sentries armed with sharpened pipes and clubs manned the entrances as others passed out golf clubs, the \"3 wood\" apparently the weapon of choice.</p> <p>\"We will stay and fight,\" protest leader Chamlong Srimuang urged the thousands-strong throng. \"Stay calm. Don't fear ... Can you be brave a little longer to save our country?\"</p> <p>But the anti-government protesters have less to fear from the army than their opponents in the Democratic Alliance against Dictatorship, camped just half a mile away. It was they, clad in red shirts, who played a cat-and-mouse game with police before breaching their lines in the early hours of yesterday to clash with the Pad protesters manning their barricades to repel the security forces.</p> <p>Middle-aged Pad stalwarts were adamant their opponents were paid by agents of the government to provoke violence to give Samak the excuse to declare emergency rule, in the hope of evicting them and ending the stalemate.</p> <p>\"I'm a manager at a factory in Samut Sakhon,\" said Pad protester Nat Rantphrakul, 55. \"Some of my workers were paid 1,000 baht [\u00a315] each to come to Bangkok. The government needed some victims to declare the state of emergency.\"</p> <h2>Backstory</h2> <p>The People's Alliance for Democracy (Pad) is a <strong>collection</strong> of rightwing activists, business people and former army chiefs.

  "<p>Iraqi troops and Kurdish peshmerga forces are bracing for conflict in the disputed city of Khanaqin in the most serious threat of clashes between Arabs and Kurds since the fall of Saddam Hussein.</p> <p>A delegation flew from Erbil, the capital of the Kurdish regional government, to Baghdad at the weekend to try to resolve the crisis. The two main Kurdish parties are allied and form part of Iraq's coalition government.</p> <p>However, Massoud Barzani, the president of the Kurdistan region, and leader of the Kurdish Democratic party, said Iraq was still living under the influence of Saddam's regime and the central government was not serious about sharing power with Kurds. He claimed many military decisions were made without consultations with General Babakir Zebari, a Kurd who is the Iraqi army's chief of staff. </p> <p>Gen Zebari, apparently torn between competing loyalties, visited Khanaqin on Monday and was quoted in the Baghdad media as saying Iraqi troops had the right to launch operations in the area. </p> <p>The crisis has grown since July when the Iraqi government ordered peshmerga forces to withdraw to Kurdistan from Diyala. It also told the two main Kurdish parties to move out of the numerous government buildings in Diyala which they had taken over when Saddam's regime fell.</p> <p>The Iraqi president, Jalal Talabani, is a Kurd and the two Kurdish parties have been firm allies of the prime minister, Nouri al-Maliki's Shia-led government since its inception. But on Sunday, the government in Baghdad shocked its Kurdish partners by announcing it would send finance ministry auditors to check customs revenues levied by Kurdish officials on the Turkish border. Transit traffic and smuggling are the main sources of revenue for some Kurds. </p> <p>Parts of northern Diyala are claimed by Kurds as part of their ancient homeland. An estimated 85% of the population of Khanaqin, which is situated on a dusty plateau close to Iran, are Kurds and Kurdish leaders insist that Khanaqin must remain under peshmerga control. </p> <p>\"The Iraqi army still wants to enter, and the peshmerga is present,\" said Ibrahim Bajelani, a Kurd who heads the provincial council. \"Everyone is on edge. If the Iraqi army tries to enter without prior agreement, we can't be held responsible for the consequences.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>The Choice </strong>(Radio 4) for Richard McCann was a brutal, simple one: whether to take his life. But the decision was enveloped by cruel twists. It was to be made 22 years after his mother was murdered by the Yorkshire Ripper. There was, said McCann, \"a clear line\" between the two things, despite the passing of time; the deliberation over suicide was prompted by the ending of another life beyond his control. Also, McCann's sister, Sonia, had made a suicide pact with him at his lowest point. Two days later, she called. \"Richard, I've taken my tablets,\" she said. \"Are you going to join me?\" </p> <p>McCann's story was one with no let-up in intensity. Family life after his mother's murder was beyond grim. Her death was a taboo subject, and he was living with a father who was an extremely violent drunk. \"He was panting as if he'd been in the boxing ring,\" McCann recalled, thinking back to one of the times his father beat Sonia. But something in McCann fought back, not with his fists, but by seeking out a way to survive. This was an admirable story of a life lived reeling from horror and somehow, later, making the right choice. </p>",
  "<p>The last time a stamp duty holiday was announced was in December 1991, by Tory chancellor Norman Lamont. The Major government was, like this Labour government, in the middle of a property slump, along with rising unemployment and a recession - something that Lamont called \"a price worth paying\" in order to get inflation down.</p> <p>They announced that for eight months the threshold for stamp duty would be raised from \u00a330,000 to \u00a3250,000, which could buy a palatial property at the time. UK property consultants King Sturge said the effect was \"a sharp, temporary squeeze in the time taken to complete the average sale as buyers rushed to complete before the holiday ended\". Prices actually fell in 1992 by 8.3% - the single biggest annual decline in prices ever recorded - and transactions were lower than at any other time in the last 34 years at 1.1m. The Nationwide showed prices carried on falling by 2.6% during the eight months of the stamp duty freeze.</p> <p>A Treasury analysis, released under freedom of information legislation, showed matters then got worse upon the reintroduction of stamp duty: \"The number of transactions collapsed and prices fell sharply ... the announcement of these large house price falls further discouraged potential buyers: the stamp duty holiday, which had been intended to bring forward a recovery in the housing market, ended up further undermining the confidence that was essential to recovery.\" One month after the government reintroduced stamp duty, saying it had cost \u00a3400m, the pound tumbled out of the exchange rate mechanism on Black Wednesday.</p>",
  "<p>Property companies were given a lift yesterday thanks to Gordon Brown's plans to ease the pressure on the housing market. The government's decision to exempt houses worth less than \u00a3175,000 from stamp duty came as relief to shares in the sector.</p> <p>Building materials group Wolseley was one of the FTSE 100's biggest percentage gainers - up more than 5% or 25p to 485.5p. And the property investment company Mapeley was the highest climber in the FTSE 250, rising 141p to close at \u00a312.79.</p> <p>Housebuilders, which have been reeling from a slowdown in the construction industry that has forced them to lay off workers, also saw gains. Shares in Persimmon increased 39p to 424.25p, while Taylor Wimpey rose 4.75p to 60.75p.</p> <p>Another industry that found relief yesterday after a recent hammering was the pub sector, led by Greene King, the Suffolk group that brews Abbot Ale and Old Speckled Hen and runs about 2,500 pubs. Kicking off a season of trading updates from pub companies, Greene King said it should meet its expectations for the financial year, despite difficult trading conditions. Like-for-like sales at its managed pub arm fell 1.6 % in the 16 weeks to August 24, better than the 2.8% decline recorded earlier in the year, the group reported. The shares leapt 48.5p to end the day at 581p.</p> <p>Dresdner Kleinwort said it was reducing its earnings per share forecast but retained a positive view. However, Investec placed its 556p target price under review. \"We are sceptical that pubs will benefit from a rebound in on-trade beer sales in the second full year of the smoking ban whilst competition from the off-trade is likely to intensify,\" said Investec analyst Matthew Gerrard. \"We also think food sales will suffer as the consumer slowdown accelerates.\"</p> <p>In the same sector, Enterprise Inns, a beleaguered stock that is in danger of dropping out of the FTSE 100 next week, rebounded 11.25p to 307.25p. Punch Taverns, which reports results today, lifted 21.75p to 316.75p, and Mitchells &amp; Butlers closed up 22p at 303p.</p> <p>The FTSE 100 ended the day up 17.9 points at 5620.7, with travel groups among the top gainers thanks to a sharp dip in the price of fuel. Cruise company Carnival was the FTSE 100's biggest percentage gainer, up more than 7% or 139p to close at \u00a320.30. Thomas Cook rose 16.75p to 246.5p, while TUI gained 12.75p to 229p.</p> <p>However, the weakening oil price was bad news for energy companies such as John Wood and Tullow Oil, which figured prominently in the roll call of losers. John Wood slipped 26.75p to 428.5p, down almost 6%, making it the FTSE 100's top faller, while Tullow lost 40.5p to end the day at 750.5p. </p> <p>Sainsbury's climbed 21.25p to 370p as rumours about a buy-out persisted for a fourth day. The supermarket group's suitors from last year, the Qatar Investment Authority, are tipped to return with a new bid pitched at 500p a share, a pound below their last effort.</p> <p>Another supposed bid target, RSA Insurance, also continued to edge up, closing up 5.2p at 161.9p.</p> <p>Recruitment firm Hays shed 0.75p to 93.5p after it warned the UK jobs market was worsening, despite reporting a 25% rise in profits. Julian Cater, an analyst at Collins Stewart, downgraded his rating on the stock to hold, noting that the chances of a takeover by Swiss rival Adecco were \"remote\". \"Notwithstanding a low valuation we foresee better entry points into the stock,\" he wrote.</p> <p>Ashtead, which leases equipment such as pumps and generators, was up 7.75p to 85p after reporting strong first-quarter results, with pre-tax profit up 26%. The group shrugged off the slowdown in the construction sector, although Investec analyst John Lawson maintained a sell rating on the stock until the economic outlook becomes clearer. \"Ashtead is a late-cycle stock and, whilst these figures are good, the outlook is still far from certain,\" he wrote. Panmure also kept its sell recommendation despite upgrading its expectations for the full year.</p> <p>Two minnows of the leisure sector combined forces yesterday. Essex-based Gamingking, the UK's leading provider of lotteries to more than 5,000 members' clubs, announced the reverse takeover of Sceptre Leisure, a deal analysts valued at around \u00a315m. Preston-based Sceptre, which supplies 6,500 pubs with fruit and quiz machines and pool tables, will end up with 85% of the shares in the merged company. </p> <p>The deal hopes to take advantage of new legislation allowing pubs to run lotteries that see half the proceeds given away in prize money and the rest split between the operators, pubs and charities - typically the British Legion and Age Concern. Gamingking shares rose 24% to 1.15p.</p> <p>On its second day on Aim, BioEnergy Africa gained again, closing up 2p at 16.5p. The company, which is chaired by former England cricketer Phil Edmonds, is developing the production of ethanol from sugar cane in southern Africa.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:chris.tryhorn@theguardian.com\">chris.tryhorn@theguardian.com</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7 Market Forces Live at:</strong> <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/markets\">blogs.theguardian.com/markets</a> </p>",
  "<p>So you think you're a good driver? How about taking a crack at this question, from the Chinese driving test: \"Categorised according to the specification terms, carriers for agricultural use include: 1. Three- and four-wheeled vehicles; 2. Three-wheeled vehicles, four-wheeled ordinary goods carriers, four-wheeled vans, four-wheeled tank carriers, and four-wheeled automatic unloading trucks; 3. Three-wheeled, four-wheeled, and six-wheeled vehicles.\"</p> <p>This pedagogical gem is courtesy of Scott Kronick, an American public relations executive living in Beijing, and one of the few foreigners to obtain a Chinese driver's licence (on the second try). Over drinks at the Peninsula Hotel, he recalled some of the test's more surreal moments. \"There was one question about if a person is lying in the middle of the street with a bone sticking out of their arm - do you move them?\"</p> <p>Given the chaotic nature of China's rapidly filling roads - one in seven Beijing drivers in 2004 was a novice - knowing how to deal with such gruesome contingencies might be wise. But for most of us, these kinds of scenarios are encountered in one place only: the driving test. It is a strange world, marked by an aching pedantry, Talmudic parsings of fine-printed traffic tomes, and ridiculously hypothetical scenarios that tend to have nothing at all to do with the traffic environment in which we will spend our lives.</p> <p>Any driver, anywhere, can recall the darker moments of these tests. I was told of a nettlesome question from the UK test that has taken on a near-mythological status; namely, what to do when approaching a horse and rider on a roundabout. The correct answer is something of a national refrain, gaily sung from Bournemouth to Blyth: you should expect the rider to go in any direction! On the French test, I had read, lurked this query: \"If you are driving down the road and a woman with a pram steps out from the pavement, should you stop or keep going?\" The answer, which seems part of some covert Gallic population-reduction scheme, is: \"Keep going. This will discourage pedestrians from behaving recklessly.\"</p> <p>In several years' research for my book Traffic, across many countries, I kept hearing of similarly outlandish questions, usually accompanied by some knowing chatter about the comparative national difficulty of driving tests. The German test, it was said, was an exercise more masochistic than viewing the Eurovision song contest. The Swedes, the story had it, made you do elaborate manoeuvres on a skid-pan. In Tenerife, it was rumoured, no one had ever passed the test on the first try. </p> <p>Another refrain I kept hearing was that the place where I had learned to drive - the United States - had one of the world's least stringent tests. My licence, it was implied, was barely worth the paper it was printed on. Determined to see whether any of this held water - and then to find out whether more stringent testing even had any relation to a safer driving population - I booked an appointment with the UK Driving Standards Agency (DSA). I would take the theory test near its headquarters in Nottingham; the practical test, meanwhile, would occur in Pinner (said to have one of the DSA's higher pass rates).</p> <p>Before leaving the US, I canvassed driving professionals about whether the bar might be lower for getting on the road in America. Judy Lundblad, the owner of Ann's Driving School, a San Francisco-based business specialising in first-time adult drivers, as well as foreigners seeking a US licence, reported a common theme. \"They find it much easier,\" she says. \"I've heard them say, 'This is really a joke.'\" In California, she notes, budget cuts have trimmed the in-car portion of the test to a mere 20 minutes (the UK is twice that). \"They don't make them parallel park,\" she says. \"They don't make them go on the freeway.\"</p> <p>Peter Kissinger, director of the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety in Washington, told me, \"I think it's more than just a myth that it is harder and more complicated to get one's licence in Europe.\" </p> <p>I was cautioned, however, by Rob Foss, director of the Centre for the Study of Young Drivers at the University of North Carolina, about drawing direct comparisons between countries. \"We can rarely, if ever, fairly compare the US directly to any other country,\" he said, \"either faulting us for not doing what others do, or for being better than others.\" </p> <p>Driving is safer in the UK, statistically, but it's also more expensive than in the US, done less, by a smaller proportion of the population, in different vehicles, on different roads - and so on. Trying to tease out the role of the driving test in all that, the implication was, would be nearly impossible. Still, I wanted to know: was the English test more difficult? Were they superior motorists? I wanted to stare into the dark heart of the driving test itself, something I hadn't done since I was 16.</p> <p>A few facts about the British driving test. It was inaugurated in 1935, and since then, nearly 92 million people have taken it - 1.8 million in 2006/7 alone. The average time spent preparing is 14 months. Aspirants take an average of 52 hours of professional instruction, spending around \u00a31,200. Even as British roads have grown more crowded over the past decade, the percentage of young people holding a licence has declined (in part because driving has become so expensive, but also because learning how to drive has become so expensive). In 2006/7, 43% of candidates passed the practical test on the first try, while 68% passed the theory test. It took an average of 2.3 attempts to pass the practical. Males have a slight (and narrowing) edge on the practical, while females have a more pronounced advantage on the theory portion. The most common manoeuvre driving instructors asked candidates to perform was \"turn in the road\". In one of five failed tests, the Department for Transport noted in a report, candidates actually performed so badly the instructor had to \"physically intervene\". </p> <p>\"Before 1935,\" I was told by Trevor Wedge, the DSA's chief driving examiner, \"people essentially learned to drive from the person they bought the car from.\" While the test is \"fundamentally the same\" as it was on its debut in 1935, there have been, he notes, a number of \"incremental changes\". Hand signals were dropped. Reverse-parking was introduced. The theory test was added in 1996 (before then it used to be a series of oral questions at the end of the practical test). In 1999, about seven minutes - the longest seven minutes of some students' (and instructors') lives - was added to the practical test.</p> <p>\"It's a very blunt instrument,\" says Wedge of the test. \"But it's worked well - we've got one of the better road safety records in the world.\" But the exact relationship between instruction, the test and road safety is unclear (a 1995 Europe-wide survey found no relation between a country's driver education systems and casualty rates). \"I don't think there's anything out there that shows it works,\" says Wedge of testing. \"It just intuitively seems to be the right thing to do.\"</p> <p>Indeed, in a city such as Delhi, it's not difficult to infer a relationship between the high number of traffic violations and the fact, documented in a study by economists at the National Bureau for Economic Research in Washington, that it's easier to obtain a licence by paying a bribe than by taking lessons. But raising the driving standard bears its own unintended consequences. In Johannesburg, home of a particularly vexing test, the unfortunate result is that more people, daunted by the difficulty, simply skip licensing altogether (and unlicensed drivers, studies have shown, have higher crash rates than those holding one).</p> <p>In the UK, the Department for Transport notes that even as the test has become more difficult - with pass rates dropping 10% since the early 1990s - \"little progress has been made in reducing the casualty rates for young car drivers\". This is the crux of the problem with learning to drive. Driving lessons, essentially, teach one to get a driver's licence. Getting the licence, as most people who pass the test admit, bears little relation to driving safety. Someone may learn to \"carry out a choreographed performance in a sterile, artificial way,\" says Wedge, but that has nothing to do with their formative memories of watching their parents drive - and nothing to do with how they will drive. </p> <p>Young drivers in particular tend to fetishise driving skills. But typically it's not skills per se that get them into trouble. Indeed, the DSA, in examining its pass-fail statistics, noted \"an apparently perverse relationship\": those who did best on the practical test had the highest rates of subsequent crashes. The \"best\" drivers were the worst drivers. Wedge points out that Finland had to alter its compulsory off-road driving test segment - rather than increasing safety, it was seeming to produce more would-be rally drivers, in the style of Timo M\u00e4kinen. \"The focus has changed to avoiding a skid rather than learning to control it,\" Wedge says. Drivers were \"letting themselves get into those skids - on the highway you haven't got as much space as on the skid pad\".</p> <p>The \"big challenge\", adds Wedge, is moving beyond the mere mechanics of pushing pedals and shifting gears, towards the \"higher-order\" skills, such as assessing risk and making decisions. Interestingly, the only change to the UK test that has seemed to have any measurable effect on safety is the hazard perception component, introduced in 2000, and based on the notion that young novice drivers - despite having faster reflexes - are measurably slower to react to potential danger. \"There's been at least a 3% reduction in accident liability in applicants who have passed the hazard perception,\" says Wedge, \"and a much bigger reduction in those that scored the highest.\"</p> <p>Armed with all this meta-driving test knowledge, I set off for the theory test. Before I had left the US, the DSA's Chris Lee had sent me a stack of books and DVDs, which were promptly relegated to an immobile stack on my desk. I figured it would be more interesting to know how my intuition and knowledge, after nearly three decades on the road, would suit me. I shrugged off Lee's warnings that any number of British television personalities, including Quentin Wilson and Jeremy Clarkson, had failed mock tests. Wedge's last words hung in the air: \"It's not unusual for somebody who is supposed to be an experienced driver to not reach the standard that we require.\"</p> <p>At the test centre, I was ushered into a small room ringed by computer workstations. A sign advised of CCTV surveillance. I immediately became aware of the nervous breathing and tapping fingers from my fellow (much younger) test-takers. A smell of adolescent desperation hovered about the room, barely squelched by the heavy deployment of bodyspray.</p> <p>I clicked \"start\". I gawped at unfamiliar signs, and tried to suss out whether certain answers were red herrings, \"too easy\" to be correct. One question asked what a driver should use on a motorway with surface spray: a) hazard flashers; b) dipped headlight; c) rear fog lights; or d) sidelights. I panicked: did my car have sidelights? Weird cultural biases crept in. One question asked about encountering a burns victim at an accident scene. I looked in vain for the only answer a driver in the litigious US could give: \"Stay in your car, call 911, and do not touch the victim as you may accidentally hurt him even more and he will sue the shirt off of your back.\"</p> <p>And, there it was, the mythical horse (white, I imagined): \"A horse rider is in the left-hand lane approaching a roundabout. You should expect the rider to ...\" Unfortunately, I hadn't yet been apprised of this famous question, and if, as an American, my experience with round-abouts was limited, my experience with equine traffic behaviour on roundabouts was nonexistent. </p> <p>I tried to puzzle it out. \"If he's in the left-hand lane approaching the roundabout ... is he in my lane, or the one across the roundabout? Might he not stop to graze upon the grass in the centre of the circle? Didn't horses as a form of road transport vanish around 1907?\" I began to sweat.</p> <p>I limped to the 50th question, then had to wait, ironically, as my results were beamed to Iowa (where test administrator Pearson has a facility) for processing. The news was not good: I had failed, scoring only 40 out of 50 (you need 43) on the theory. The \"road and traffic signs\" section was my Waterloo, the uncracked Highway Code my fatal flaw. More disturbingly, I had barely passed - by three points - the hazard perception segment. Was I a near-incompetent, or just an uncaring sociopath? Had I played too many rounds of Grand Theft Auto 4? I had been warned that indiscriminate mouse-<br>clicking at potential hazards was as bad as under-clicking, but as I drove, I found myself succumbing to the Hyacinth Bucket Syndrome: everything seemed a potential hazard. The man indolently strolling the pavement might rashly bolt toward the road. Keyed up, the slightest flash of another vehicle caused an involuntary twitch in my finger.</p> <p>Clutching my letter of failure, I headed to Pinner for the practical test (normally one does have to pass the theory to move on). My DSA examiner Mark Winn and I climbed into my hire-car, automatic-transmission Nissan Note (a friend had driven me there) and headed into the suburban streets. Driving on a new side of the road was taxing my brain, but on the quieter streets I tried to plumb Winn for information.</p> <p>What was the most common fault? \"It changes over the years, but typically it's pulling out inappropriately at junctions.\" Is it true that younger drivers have a higher pass rate than older drivers? \"They're immersed in the learning environment, so learning comes more naturally to them.\" Do people ever cry? \"It's an important event in people's lives, it could make a big difference. People put themselves under all sorts of pressure to get their licences.\" (I took that as a yes). Has the driving standard changed over the years? \"A long time ago, people were taught to change down through the gears sequentially. Now, the preferred technique is selective gear changing - you change to the gear you need. Brakes are for slowing, and gears are for going.\" Why are the pass rates so different across the UK? \"There are geographic differences. In more affluent areas, there's more money to spend on lessons, the learner is more likely to have access to a second vehicle or they have their own vehicle to practise in. That all goes into making them better prepared for the test.\"</p> <p>At times, I sensed Winn wanted me to concentrate more on driving. When he asked me to reverse out of a side road on to the main road, I queried incredulously: \"You can do that here?\" (it's not generally allowed in the US). He was showing a good-natured resolve in the face of my questions and minor mishaps, rather like the driving instructor in the Borat film who gently advises why his student cannot \"make a sexy time\" with a neighbouring driver.</p> <p>Nearing the end of the test, I took a left turn on to a small residential street. My left wheels dragged over the kerb. I shrugged it off to drive-on-the-left spatial disorientation, and the unfamiliar dynamics of the hire car. Otherwise, I thought it had gone well. As we parked, though, Winn turned to me and said, \"I'm sorry to inform you that you've not passed. Would you like to know why?\" It was the last kerb. \"You destabilised the car quite a bit. Rather than just bumping the kerb you actually got the wheel up on to it. The level of assessment changes.\"</p> <p>I felt 16 again, remembering the agony of postponement after having failed at my first attempt. The oddity, of course, was that despite having failed to measure up to the UK driving standard, I could waltz into any hire-car agency and acquire wheels with my US licence. To the relief of northwest London, I took the train.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Traffic: Why We Drive the Way We Do (and What it Says About Us) by Tom Vanderbilt is published by Allen Lane, price \u00a320.</p>",
  "<p>Andrew Roberts well remembers the morning, back in March 1973, when Radio 4's Today programme broadcast an interview with him about the formation of a union for mental patients. \"It took them three hours to decide if it was safe to let a mental patient into Broadcasting House,\" he says. After the broadcast, his phone didn't stop ringing all morning, and more than 100 people turned up later that day for the union's inaugural meeting at the Paddington day hospital, a therapeutic community in west London. </p> <p>Thus was born the first Mental Patients Union (MPU) in England (there was already one in Scotland, which partly inspired the idea). It was one of a wave of radical political service user organisations that sprung up all over the country in the 1970s, formed by and for patients, or \"survivors\", to represent their views and defend their rights against what they perceived to be a politically oppressive psychiatric system. </p> <p>Today, Roberts is a member of the Survivor History Group (SHG), a small collection of individuals who are collating a history of the survivor movement. Their aim is to provide a permanent record of the politics and achievements of the movement. They hope to remind us that advocacy, crisis cards and crisis houses - user-centred ways of providing support to people with mental health problems - were developed and pioneered back in the 1970s and 1980s, by such groups of politically radical individuals with personal experience of incarceration within the mental health system. It is important, they believe, for today's campaigners and activists to understand the historical context for their work.</p> <p>Many of the management committee members were heavily involved in so-called \"mad politics\" back in the 1960s, 70s and 80s. The group includes Roberts, a member of the Hackney MPU; Frank Bangay, a member of Protection of the Rights of Mental Patients in Therapy, formed in 1976 (which became the Campaign Against Psychiatric Oppression in 1985) and of the radical action group Mad Pride in the 1990s; and Peter Campbell, a founder member of Survivors Speak Out, a national networking group formed in 1986 for mental health service users.</p> <p>\"Things were completely different in the early 80s,\" says Campbell. \"At that time, the byword for getting involved in user groups was the perception of psychiatry as a form of social control. There was very little emphasis on the kinds of involvement available to service users today - consultations about the nuts and bolts of running services. The groups were much more political. The last thing we would have thought about was joining a committee to discuss community care.\"</p> <p>He goes on to explain that the movement was often misrepresented by social scientists, who emphasised the links between anti-psychiatry and the survivor movement. \"There is a perception of the survivor movement as a few radical mental health professionals with some semi-empowered activists in their train. That isn't how it was,\" he says. \"Even in the early 90s, nobody in the statutory services gave a damn about advance directives or advocacy - the assumption is that these things have happened through the guidance of right-minded professionals. But they had to be fought for. A lot of it was about working against the mental health system and fighting to get organisations like Mind and Rethink behind us. </p> <p>\"We need survivors recording how we saw it. We need to point this out, and record how we think things happened.\"</p> <p>Clare Ockwell became involved in the survivor movement more recently, through the user-run training and consultancy organisation Capital. She says it is important that today's mental health practitioners are aware of the history behind the new developments in service provision that they are now being asked to implement. </p> <p>\"Being part of this group and learning about our heritage has for me made a lot of sense and is something I am using in my work training today's mental health service providers and users. Without that work, we would not be where we are now,\" she says.</p> <p>Mark Cresswell, lecturer in sociology at the school of applied social sciences at Durham University, is one of a small but growing band of academics who are interested in the Survivor History project's work. He agrees that academic social scientists have so far produced only partial versions of the roots of the user movement, and stresses the need for more \"subjective\" accounts from users themselves. </p> <p>\"We urgently need more opportunities for people with direct experience of psychiatry to recount their historical experiences and their analyses of those experiences,\" he says. He points to the Testimony archive of patients' accounts of their experiences in the old asylums compiled by Mental Health Media. The archive is now held by the British Library. </p> <p>\"I worry that sometimes the powers-that-be are quite happy to embrace the 'survivor voice' tokenistically, without taking any notice of the criticism contained within it. I find the Testimony project powerful precisely because the cumulative testimonies contained within it amount to an extensive and overwhelming critique.\"</p> <p>The group is still deciding how it will collect and record its history. Lack of space currently precludes creating a physical archive from the piles of documents amassed by individual members. </p> <p>Roberts says: \"Our main aim is to give people an opportunity to come forward and say what their history was, their version of what happened, rather than try to obtain a generalised, simplified, overall view. We want to record the diversity of histories and the dynamics between the different groups and perspectives. </p> <p>\"If we don't have a group like this, our history is going to be some academic's book in five years' time and we'll be saying, 'We were there and it wasn't like that.'\"</p> <p><strong> \u00b7 </strong>Read Andrew Roberts' account of the day the MPU was founded, at <a href=\"http://www.SocietyGuardian.co.uk/mentalhealth\">SocietyGuardian.co.uk/mentalhealth</a></p>",
  "<p>For years now, the lugubrious strains of Blue Moon have been the defiantly rendered song of choice for supporters of Manchester City football club, long accustomed to suffer in the shadows of that other Mancunian club. Now, out of the, er, blue, has come an audacious Gulf state takeover that blithely promises to make City - yes, permanently underachieving, dreaming of the Colin Bell-era City - into the richest and most successful club in the world.</p> <p>With irresistible symbolism, the club's new owners proved their intent by snatching the coveted Real Madrid player Robinho from under the noses of Chelsea, until this week the game's biggest spenders. Yesterday, the new owner, Sulaiman al-Fahim, backed by the Abu Dhabi royal family, raised the stakes, promising to bring Manchester United's superstar Christiano Ronaldo across the city when the transfer window reopens in January. For those City fans who are still capable of lifting their dropped jaws off the floor, Blue Moon must suddenly have become My Blue Heaven.</p> <p>Seen from almost anywhere except Gorton or Ardwick, however, this week's events are simply the latest stage in English club football's rapid modern rite of passage from community to commodity. Twenty years ago, like most big clubs, City had long been owned by a local businessman who was also a fan. When he was ousted in 1994 the new owner crossed the Rubicon and listed the club on the stock exchange. Everything that happened this week follows from that move. As football grew rich on TV income, sponsorship and merchandising, the ownership structure became ever more profit oriented and ever more remote from the angry but romantic world of the fans. A year ago, City was taken over by the billionaire Thai populist Thaksin Shinawatra, who had long been eyeing any club he could get his hands on. At the weekend, Mr Thaksin sold his plaything on to Mr al-Fahim, an oil billionaire who boasts that money is no object. </p> <p>The saga is merely the most spectacular example of an irreversible shift in the top clubs which communities and fans seem powerless to control. Last time it was Chelsea. Now it is Manchester City. Soon it will be another club, possibly Arsenal or Newcastle. It is a spectacular process and it fuels tremendous entertainment. But it is a collective delusion not to see that it is all a classic live-now-pay-later Faustian pact. For football fans, a season or two's bought glory may feel like a prize beyond price. But in the end it is all another example of the headlong sacrifice of our way of life and our planet to oil profiteers who respect neither laws nor traditions. Maybe that's life. But football fans always prefer innocence to experience.</p>",
  "<p>There was a gorgeous moment after Andy Murray had hit a particularly imperious double-fisted backhand down the line under the floodlights in the Arthur Ashe stadium here on Monday evening when his coach, Miles Maclagan, flicked his eyebrows in an expression of \"where the hell did that come from?\" surprise. This 6-1, 6-3, 6-3 fourth-round victory over Switzerland's Stanislas Wawrinka, the world No10, and Olympic doubles gold medal winner with Roger Federer, was as near perfection as Murray has ever achieved at grand slam level. He quite clearly believes that today, when his quarter-final will switch from night to sunshine, that he can achieve something similar against Argentina's Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro, currently in the middle of the richest vein of form in his teenage life.</p> <p>\"He doesn't miss a whole a lot and he moves pretty well for a big guy,\" said Murray. \"But when you watch him I don't think that you see anything that's unbelievably special.\" If this sounded as if Murray was damning the 6ft 6in Argentinian with faint praise then it would not be too far from the truth. The two have met only once before, at the Italian Open this year, when the Argentinian retired with a back injury, although not before a minor altercation sparked by Del Potro when he drilled a ball at Murray, refused to apologise, and then made remarks about his mother, Judy, who was there supporting him.</p> <p>\"I haven't spoken to him since, but for me it's another tennis match. When you get on the court you've got to put your emotions aside and get the job done. Whether I like Del Potro or not really doesn't make any difference,\" said Murray whose professionalism and maturity have increased markedly this year. There will be blips both on and off the court but here is a British player resolute in the belief that he can win a grand slam title. And, unlike Tim Henman, he has the ability and game to back it up. This win lifted him to a career-high No5, making it virtually certain, barring injury, that he will be in Shanghai later this year for his first appearance in the end-of-season Tennis Masters Cup, limited to the world's top eight players.</p> <p>The gap between him and Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic remains considerable, although he has twice beaten the Serb this summer, and holds a 2-1 career advantage over Federer. At Wimbledon, after defeating France's Richard Gasquet over five sets in the fourth round, he never remotely looked like defeating Nadal. \"I got killed. He played way too good for me, but I feel like I'm playing better now. I'm definitely going to be more rested this time round and hopefully play a better match.\"</p> <p>Should he defeat Del Potro then Nadal may be his semi-final opponent, though for now all thoughts are focused on the Argentinian who since an early exit at Wimbledon has won four tournaments in succession. His 6-3, 6-4, 6-3 fourth-round victory over the 18-year-old Kei Nishikori, the first Japanese man to reach the last 16 of this tournament since 1937, extended his unbeaten run to 23. \"I've known him since we were juniors,\" said Murray. \"I wasn't really great friends with him before, and I don't need to be now.\"</p> <p>The most impressive aspect of Murray's win over Wawrinka was the way he took control. The Swiss was nervous and Murray rarely allowed him a whiff of sustaining oxygen. His groundstrokes were stunning and the 24,000 crowd could only admire what they saw. \"I'd been looking forward to playing my first night match in the Arthur Ashe for a long, long time, and then to play like that made it pretty special,\" he said. \"It is such a huge stadium that there is always a buzz. I loved every minute of it.\"</p> <p>Several times Murray gazed up at the giant electronic scoreboard as the replays were shown. \"I think most players watch. They normally only show good points, so that's why,\" Murray smiled. He had good reason too, and will hope to again against Del Potro today. \"I think I'm playing well enough to win.\" If he can replicate his performance against Wawrinka then it seems altogether likely.</p>",
  "<p>A race that began as the West Wing now looks alarmingly like Desperate Housewives. Six months ago, you couldn't help but notice the striking similarity between Barack Obama and Matthew Santos, the fictional but charismatic ethnic minority candidate who promised to heal America's divide. Now, you can't help but feel you're watching an especially lurid episode from Wisteria Lane, as the real-life Sarah Palin fends off rumours of a fake pregnancy - and the accusation that her son is actually her grandson - by revealing that her unmarried 17-year-old daughter is expecting a baby and will soon marry the father, a young hockey player. Meanwhile, Palin has hired a lawyer to beat back a state investigation into claims that she abused the power of her office to remove her sister's ex-husband from his job as a state trooper, a man who has admitted tasering his own 10-year-old stepson! Would even America's trashiest daytime soaps dare squeeze that much action into just the first four days of a new storyline?</p> <p>The McCain campaign has done it, thereby achieving in an instant one of its key objectives. At last people are talking about the Republicans, after months in which all the excitement had been on the other side. Ever since McCain introduced Palin to a stunned, unprepared political world last Friday, Obama has barely had a look-in. From conservative talk radio to celebrity gossip websites, there is only one topic: it's all Palin, all the time.</p> <p>In these reams of commentary, there is uncertainty about the only question that really matters: how will this saga, and Palin herself, play in the November election? Ultimately, will she hurt or hinder John McCain?</p> <p>If it's hard to tell, that's because almost every new nugget we discover about Governor Palin can be viewed in radically opposite lights. The \"family values\" brigade might be shocked by the admission of premarital sex in the Palin clan; or it might be heartened that young Bristol - even the names sound like they come from a TV soap - has chosen to carry her baby to term and marry the father. So far, the latter reaction seems to have prevailed, with the Christian right, already smitten by Palin's anti-abortion, pro-guns, anti-gay marriage stances, standing by its woman. Some McCain backers have even tried to turn the episode into a net positive: talkshow host Michael Graham wrote yesterday that Palin, with one son off to Iraq, another with Down's syndrome and now a daughter set to become a teenage mom, had undergone experiences that millions of American women could relate to: \"Sarah Palin is as accessible as Obama is exotic.\" </p> <p>Or take what was, until the soap suds started lathering up, Palin's most obvious weakness: her inexperience. To political veterans, it's ludicrous to propose that a 20-month governor of a state with a population of under 700,000 is ready to take over as president (not such a remote possibility, given that John McCain is 72 and has a history of cancer). They note that when Palin visited Kuwait last year, she reportedly had to apply for a passport: she had never travelled outside North America before. How could she possibly be ready to lead the world's greatest military power? </p> <p>But Democrats who make these points risk doing the Republicans' work for them, falling into the wearily familiar trap of sounding like condescending coastal elitists, who look down their noses at ordinary Americans like the Palins. The blue-collar Republican base is already wild for the governor: every time they see a New York talking head say how absurd her candidacy is, they'll like her even more. </p> <p>Besides, the McCain camp is already hard at work spinning that all this inexperience is a good thing. It means, they say, that Palin will be a \"breath of fresh Alaska air\" in stale Washington, an outsider who had already dared take on politics-as-usual in her own state. Viewed that way, Palin has restored to McCain what always used to be his USP: his status as the reformer, fearlessly standing against the machine. </p> <p>So she will go into the vice-presidential TV debate against the seasoned senator and foreign policy sage Joe Biden cushioned by subterraneanly low expectations. If she manages to utter several coherent sentences in a row, it will be declared a draw. If he so much as looks patronising or if he does an Al Gore-style sigh of impatience, she will be declared the winner. He's a bruiser who would have been eager to crush any male opponent. Now he'll be holding himself back lest he looks like a sexist pig. </p> <p>There are some straightforward negatives for Palin that are not susceptible to even the most energetic spin. It's not good that she turns out to have been for the notorious \"bridge to nowhere\" - a $400m project in Alaska that has come to symbolise wasteful, \"pork-barrel\" spending - before she was against it. It dents her image as a reformer and shows she flip-flops as much as any other politician. Not helpful, either, that in the 1990s she was a member of the Alaskan Independence party, which seeks a referendum on breaking away from the US. The firing of her brother-in-law, and the outstanding request that she give a deposition on the matter, under oath, will linger through the campaign. And the fact that the McCain camp seems to have started seriously vetting Palin after nominating her, only now sending lawyers and researchers to Alaska, reflects especially badly on McCain himself. (He met her properly for the first time last week, according to the New York Times.) It suggests the downside of all that maverick brio is a recklessness that is hardly suitable in a commander-in-chief. </p> <p>What no one can know is whether that cost will be outweighed by the gains Palin brings, galvanising a socially conservative base that had been previously lukewarm towards McCain. What we can know already is that this election will share a depressing feature with the contests of the past 40 years: that America will plunge again into the never-ending culture wars. </p> <p>For Palin cannot help but polarise the electorate. Everything that liberal, blue-state America can't stand about her makes conservative, red-state America swoon. It's not just about \"Jesus babies and guns,\" as Rush Limbaugh pithily put it. Palin also wants \"intelligent design\" - creationism - taught in school. When she was mayor of the small town of Wasilla, \"she asked the library how she could go about banning books,\" according to a local official quoted by Time. Palin was worried about \"inappropriate\" language. \"The librarian was aghast\" - and was later threatened with the sack. </p> <p>In his stirring speech last week, Obama urged America not to \"make a big election about small things\". Yet here we are, discussing not Sarah Palin's record or programme but Jesus, guns, and as one feminist blogger put it yesterday, \"the uterine activity of her family\". This is a setback for women, especially in a year that seemed to promise a breakthrough, but it is also a setback for America itself. </p> <p>Obama made his name four years ago with a speech that called for an end to the civil war of red against blue. In 2008, he urged a different kind of election, one that would match the gravity of the hour. But the naming of Sarah Palin, and the reaction it has provoked, has dashed that hope. Americans are, once again, fighting over the questions that politics can never really settle - faith, sexuality - and pushing aside the ones that it can. And which it must. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:freedland@theguardian.com\">freedland@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>It all started when I idly noticed that a sign on the back of a London bus warned motorists that the fine for driving in a bus lane was \u00a3120. <br>Coincidentally, contrary to my usual dismissive practice, I'd been reading a few of those ubiquitous newspaper stories about householders who'd been fined by their enthusiastic local councils for leaving their dustbins 2cm too near the kerb, or putting a piece of paper into the wrong recycling aperture. For some reason, most of the penalties imposed for those grievous offences were around \u00a3100 or \u00a3110. In a further coincidence, I needed to know more about the on-the-spot fines that the police are increasingly handing out to perpetrators of what are described as \"low-level\" crimes. But these allegedly petty offences, it's become clear, can include acts of violence against the person, albeit not the gravest kind. The usual fines for such assaults is \u00a380. Driving while talking on a mobile phone comes even more cheaply, at \u00a360, even though such conduct is a proven cause of accidents, sometimes fatal. I know. A student of mine was killed when she lost control of her car because she was on the phone. Is there anyone who believes that interfering in a small way with the free flow of public transport (though you get fined even if there are no buses in sight) is more heinous than beating someone up? Or that failing to be a perfect recycler of household rubbish is worthy of greater punishment than irresponsible driving which puts lives at risk? </p> <p>My point is this. People may be understandably shocked by the amount of the fine for driving in a London bus lane. I certainly am. But that shock turns to anger when they start making comparisons, when they read of a drunken thug getting away with an irrelevant fine while a forgetful pensioner who put out her bin on the wrong day is stung for her week's pension. That's what I call offensive disproportion. </p> <p>In my utopian world of fairness and justice, there would be a Minister for the Abolition of Offensive Disproportion, whose sole job it would be to look at the kind of cases I've been describing (there are many more) and to pronounce upon them: \"This cannot be right. Assault is worse than incorrect dustbinning. That's the moral truth. Either raise the penalty for one or lower it for the other. But don't leave it as it is; that's not what our society's about.\" Of course there can never be such a guardian of sense and moral proportion. But is there nothing that can be done in real life, to take one example, to stem rampant local authorities from treating absent-minded householders who make binning mistakes as ever more profitable milch-cows? </p> <p>The examples of offensive disproportion I've given above have come from the lower end of the financial scale, though none the less infuriating for that. And they don't have to involve penalties for wrongdoing. The same sense of unfairness can be felt when we're talking huge sums at the other extreme. It has generally been estimated that the Iraq war has so far cost Britain around \u00a36-\u00a37bn. But last year the government was willing to gamble with - which often means losing - more than \u00a350bn of taxpayers' money. For what? To ensure that an irresponsible bank called Northern Rock did not go bust. That disparity shocked me. I'm not saying we should be spending more on Iraq. But I found it astonishing and disturbing that the government thought it perfectly in order to stake seven or eight times the amount spent on a five-year long foreign war just to keep one incompetent financial institution (not even one of the country's largest) alive. Was there no one sensible or courageous enough to tell Alistair Darling or whoever: \"This is wildly disproportionate and wrong. It will not do\"?</p> <p><strong>I was interested in hurricane Gustav even before it </strong> became a player in the American presidential elections. It was an unusual name for a hurricane. Only the second, I think, to have a popular central European link. Otto was the other, redolent of pre-war Berlin, the painter Dix and the conductor Klemperer. Was Gustav, I hoped, named after Mahler or Klimt? Alas, the truth is humdrum. The names were chosen by the World Meteorological Organisation, not in any systematic way, but by using the names of WMO spouses or children, provided they were easy to pronounce. It's only since 1979 that both sexes have been represented; it was women-only before that. Most of the names were picked years ago, and are recycled every six years, so Gustav also blew in 2002, 1996 etc. The names of hurricanes which caused tragedy, though, are permanently \"retired\", as the WMO puts it. </p> <p>There will never be another Katrina. </p> <p>But even a hurricane's name can be controversial. Almost all of them are what you might describe as white European names, quite a few with a Spanish flavour; there's even an Omar. But not one name is African-American, and this wind-discrimination is beginning to rile. The issue has now been raised publicly by a member of the US Congress, Sheila Jackson Lee. I expect that the next name to be retired - it may even be Gustav, which has now become too famous to be repeated - will be replaced by an obviously black name. Bloggers reacting to Jackson Lee's plea are having fun playing with famous rappers' names. Here comes Hurricane 50 Cent. </p> <p><strong>This week Marcel read</strong> After Dark, by Haruki Murakami and Man in the Dark, by Paul Auster: \"It was accidental that my weekly reading had a titular darkness theme - both novels take place over one night - but both are brilliant, moving and partly surreal.

  "<p>Two years ago Abigail Delaney was a civil servant with the Home Office, living in her own house with her young daughter and saving every month. She had always liked a drink, but when her relationship with her partner broke down, so did her control over alcohol.</p> <p>\"I've always worked, every day since I was 17,\" she says. \"Looking at me now you wouldn't think that I had the life I did. Through alcohol I lost everything - my daughter, my career. Now I can't make my mortgage repayments, so I'll probably lose my home as well.\"</p> <p>She sweeps her arm around the small outside courtyard of the Turning Point centre in Oldham, Greater Manchester where she has been trying to piece her life back together for the past 18 months.</p> <p>\"This place, it's full of people who are desperate to get their lives back,\" she says. \"We're not scabs or on benefits because we don't want to work. We all want to get back to work, we just don't know how. Because, honestly, who'd have us?\" </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337239534\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Society/Pix/pictures/2008/09/02/4annemcguire.jpg\" alt=\"Anne McGuire\" width=\"220\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The disability minister, Anne McGuire: \"Nobody should feel they are incapable of bettering themselves.\"</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This morning, Delaney is one of the small group of service users due to meet disability minister Anne McGuire, who is in the north-west as part of the government's ongoing consultation on its welfare reform green paper. </p> <p>Billed by the work and pensions secretary, James Purnell, as a \"radical\" reform of welfare services, the paper has created a frenzy of debate since its launch earlier this year. It states that its main aims are to simplify the benefits system and \"deliver greater and more personalised support for people in return for more responsibility\".</p> <p>It proposes to replace incapacity benefit (IB) with an Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) for people with either a medical condition that prevents them from working, or who need high-level support to get them ready for work, and a jobseekers' allowance (JSA) for those \"fit to work\". The reforms are intended to ensure that out-of-work benefits are a strictly temporary measure for the majority of people claiming them. </p> <p><strong>Punitive sanctions</strong></p> <p>Although the green paper stresses that its emphasis is on creating pathways back to the workplace, what is causing most concern at Turning Point are the punitive sanctions (\"the big stick\", according to one of the charity's project leaders), contained in the proposals. </p> <p>At its most extreme, drug addicts and alcoholics could have their benefits cut if they refuse to seek treatment and take steps to get back into employment, and long-term unemployed people could face US-style work-for-dole programmes. </p> <p>\"We've all read the papers that say addicts could be forced to repay their benefits or be sent to jail, or that people who don't find work will get their benefits cut,\" says Nicholas Anthony, also battling a long-term alcohol addiction. \"It feels like the government is saying that anyone on incapacity benefits could be back at work but just can't be arsed. This morning I couldn't even afford \u00a315 to get myself on a local training programme. The idea that I'm choosing not to work is a joke.\"</p> <p>What most concerns service users like Delaney and Anthony is how employers are going to be \"made\" to employ \"people like us\" - former addicts, or people who have criminal convictions or serious long-term mental health issues that have kept them out of the workplace for years at a time. \"I'm a trained and experienced civil servant but, despite what they say, which government department is going to hire me after I haven't worked for two years because of my alcoholism?\" asks Delaney. At the same time, she doesn't want to end up being forced to \"stack shelves\" because her benefits will be cut if she doesn't take up an offer of any work. </p> <p>\"It seems the way this government is going, you don't get any help if you want to better yourself,\" she says. \"I'm not the same as someone who has never worked a day of their lives or who has just sat on incapacity benefits since they were 16, but I don't see any difference in the way we're being treated.\"</p> <p>McGuire is alarmed at this interpretation of her department's welfare reforms. After spending years running community employment services, she is keen to stress her voluntary-sector credentials to the service users. Yet despite her informal and relaxed manner, she remains resolutely on-message. The green paper, she insists, should be seen as a carrot and not a stick. The whole point of the welfare reforms is to find ways to help anyone who wants to work to do so. \"People like you,\" she says to Delaney. \"Will absolutely not have your benefits cut. It's about us all taking responsibility.\"</p> <p>On the way to Chadderton Court, a voluntary sector mental health project on the other side of Oldham, McGuire says: \"When I meet people like [Delaney], it just firms my resolve that this emphasis on rights and responsibility can make a real difference. Nobody should feel they are incapable of bettering themselves.\"</p> <p>After more handshakes and photographs with service users and project leaders, McGuire expresses disappointment that sanctions have received the lion's share of the debate around the new welfare reform proposals.</p> <p><strong>Tough messages</strong></p> <p>\"Yes, there are tough messages in the welfare reform proposals and a conditional element in this paper, and we've been upfront about this,\" she says. \"But the overarching point is that we're not writing anyone off.\"</p> <p>Before, the government saw the 2.4 million people on IB as outside mainstream welfare services, she argues. \"[Then,] we didn't ask anyone on incapacity benefits to do anything. We didn't say, 'Look there are skills and expertise that you have. Yes, they have to be brushed up, and of course there are issues of substance abuse or confidence or other barriers that are stopping people getting back into work, but it's part of our responsibility as a government to offer a bridge.'\"</p> <p>All agree that the biggest challenge this vision of welfare reform faces is its ability to tackle and overcome the discrimination and stigma surrounding disability, mental illness and substance abuse that could cloud employers' willingness to play along with efforts to get those on IB back into work.</p> <p>McGuire insists that initiatives are in place to do this. \"It's about saying to employers we need to stop judging people by what they can't do. We're talking about a cultural change and this doesn't happen overnight, but we're putting as much welly behind it as we can.\"</p> <p>McGuire says the consultation process has so far proved \"very useful\" in ensuring ministers are hearing the voices of those on the ground. But it is only after she has gone that one of the Chadderton Court volunteers, Sylvia Thompson, describes how for years she couldn't leave her house, that she had to pay local children to go to the shop for her and that for the 10 years she was out of work, she never once thought she'd be capable of working again. </p> <p>\"If it hadn't been for Chadderton Court, I would still be at home with the curtains drawn,\" she says. \"These people literally saved my life, but it took years of coming here before I was ready to make the smallest step forward. I only hope the government realises how long it takes for some people to make that transition, because the thought of being forced back into work because I was worried I'd lose my benefits makes me feel sick. It would have been a catastrophe.\"</p> <p><strong> \u00b7 </strong>Anne McGuire will be live online on Monday September 8 to answer your questions about welfare reform <a href=\"http://www.SocietyGuardian.co.uk \">SocietyGuardian.co.uk </a></p>",
  "<h2>Charities involved in bids to run new private jails</h2> <p>Britain's leading crime reduction charities, Nacro and Rainer Crime Concern, are part of two rival consortiums bidding to run two new private prisons on Merseyside and in London. The consortiums are led by the private security companies G4S and Serco, which are hoping to run the 600-bed Maghull and Belmarsh West, due to open in 2010. It is the first time that a charity or voluntary sector organisation has been involved in a bid to run a private prison. The charities will not be involved in prison security; instead they will manage rehabilitation and resettlement programmes. <br><strong>Alan Travis</strong></p> <h2>Teachers 'need improved disabilities training'</h2> <p>Training for new teachers is failing to equip them to teach pupils with learning difficulties and disabilities, school inspectors have warned. Teacher training providers rely too heavily on schools to train teachers, with less than half of schools surveyed providing trainees with a good induction into teaching pupils with learning difficulties and disabilities, Ofsted found. Janet Thompson, an Ofsted inspector and the report's author, said: \"Providers need to make sure there's somebody with specialised knowledge to oversee the training of their own courses but also in schools.\" <br><strong>Anthea Lipsett</strong></p> <h2>IRA council no longer a terrorist threat, says Orde</h2> <p>The IRA's Army Council still exists but no longer meets for any terrorist purpose, Northern Ireland's chief constable told the first minister, Peter Robinson, yesterday. The DUP leader said he accepted what Sir Hugh Orde said, but insisted that the continued existence of the IRA's ruling body still posed a major block to political progress and must be removed. Robinson has put down a de facto deadline of September 18 for the survival of powersharing. The Northern Ireland Executive has not met since June and is scheduled to hold its first cabinet meeting on that date. <br><strong>Henry McDonald</strong></p> <h2>Thousands of heritage sites open their doors</h2> <p>Heritage Open Days announced its biggest programme to date yesterday, with almost 3,600 usually off-limits heritage sites opening their doors next week. \"This is the largest single cultural event of the year,\" said Maria Adebowale of English Heritage, whose staff, together with the Civic Trust and local authorities, will provide 35,000 voluntary guides. More than a million people across the country are expected to take part. During the annual event, which runs from September 11-14, one of the outings is a tour of the workshops which maintain Blackpool's illuminations. <br><strong>Martin Wainwright</strong></p> <h2>Jolie posters unsuitable, says standards watchdog</h2> <p>Two posters for a film starring Angelina Jolie and James McAvoy could be seen to condone violence and are not suitable to be viewed by children, the advertising standards watchdog ruled yesterday. Seventeen people complained about posters for the film Wanted, on the grounds that they glorified gun crime, the Advertising Standards Authority said. The ASA noted that Universal Pictures (UK) said the advertisements were no longer appearing and it had no plans for their future use. The film was based on a comic book of the same name and the posters' style reflected the film's roots, the company said.<br><strong>Press Association</strong></p> <h2>Hacker's lawyers make plea to home secretary</h2> <p>Lawyers acting for computer hacker Gary McKinnon are awaiting a response from the home secretary, Jacqui Smith, to their request that she halts plans to extradite him to the US and puts him on trial in the UK. McKinnon has been diagnosed as suffering from Asperger's syndrome after doctors who saw him on television last month contacted his lawyers. Karen Todner, McKinnon's lawyer, said yesterday that he had offered to plead guilty in the UK to offences under the Misuse of Computers Act. She added that she had written to Smith about the \"horrendous\" conditions in US jails. <br><strong>Duncan Campbell </strong></p> <h2>Apology after riot officers ransack wrong house</h2> <p>Police apologised yesterday after mistakenly ransacking a woman's home in search of uniform items stolen from their own station. Officers in riot gear smashed down Chris Harrison's door in an attempt to recover police epaulettes and a belt. During the raid in Newent, Gloucestershire, they rifled through the 59-year-old's possessions, despite neighbours' pleas they had the wrong address. When the team did not find anything they went to a second house on the estate, where they arrested three people. The items have now been found. Gloucestershire police said it was sorry for the \"damage and distress\".<br><strong>Press Association</strong></p>",
  "<p>Rabbis Goldberg and Romain are right to suggest that \"faith schools are not the best way to heal our fractured society\" (Campaigners fight to stop schools recruiting staff based on religion, August 30). By their nature, faith schools are prone to separate youngsters from the wider culture, and lead them to assume they are different and, by definition, superior to the rest of the population. </p> <p>That is bad for community relations in general and for their own coreligionists' real security in the long run. It is perfectly possible to be a Jew, Christian, or a Muslim, and still live within the wider community. As a 75-year-old Jew, I know that I am no less and no more of a Jew since attending cheder for an hour after normal school, four evenings a week, than I would be had I attended an unheard-of-then faith school. I feel this especially when I contemplate Jewish parents now, in my native Leeds, actually bussing their children daily to a Jewish school in distant Manchester. I cannot think of a more effective way of distancing children from the rest of their community - the quiet hostility this breeds among others is something I hate to contemplate.<br><strong>Stanley Walinets</strong><br>Mickleton, Co Durham</p> <p>It is dismaying to learn that the government plans to push ahead with the expansion in numbers of state-funded faith schools, despite what I believe to be adverse majority opinion. </p> <p>The determination of faith schools to select staff by religious affiliation is an obvious consequence, and it is easy to conjecture other undesirable consequences likely to follow the fragmentation of the state-funded schools system along sectarian lines. Staff and parents will clearly come under pressure to conceal their true beliefs, an unhealthy social consequence in itself. But, more important is the determination to control young minds at a vital stage of their growth, inhibiting their ability to think clearly about social and ethical problems, and to reach reasoned judgments about the natural world.<br><strong>Francis Westoby</strong><br>Hitchin, Hertfordshire</p> <p>I believe there is another reason for concern about schools recruiting staff based on their religion. As a school governor I have been involved in the selection of headteachers in two secondary schools - one faith and the other a county one. There was a stark contrast between the quality of the applicants. They were poor in the faith school but high quality for the county one. One of the candidates in the faith school eventually became headteacher. Meanwhile, in the county school, a strong candidate with an enlightened attitude to education also became head. I will not spell out the results. The reality is that when looking for talent, a county school is fishing in the wide open Atlantic but a faith one only in a goldfish bowl.<br><strong>Name and address supplied</strong></p>",
  "<p>Sir Colin Davis's Prom with the Gustav Mahler Youth Orchestra consisted of just two works. Nikolaj Znaider was the soloist in Beethoven's Violin Concerto, the least showy of the breed, in a performance as notable for its orchestral balance as for the violinist's mature interpretative authority. Throughout, Davis maintained benign control over a reading that found conductor and violinist in absolute sympathy with each other and with their material. After the interval, Davis's commitment to Sibelius shone in a performance of the Second Symphony. The conductor's art-concealing art consists in following through the implications of the notes without underlining them; the finale's big theme arrived without ostentation, yet sounded all the grander for being integrated into a process that had begun as far back as the opening phrase of the first movement.</p> <p>The unusual lineup for the evening's second Prom brought together the BBC Singers under David Hill, with the distinguished sitar player Nishat Khan. The two were even pitched together in an opening group of French Renaissance chansons and motets interspersed with sitar improvisations; though both seemed slightly inhibited here, they later excelled in their own fields. The BBC Singers delivered a dynamic account of Messiaen's sensual Cinq Rechants, whose refrain-based structures create a vibrant sequence of playfully erotic sound patterns. Khan, accompanied by tabla and tanpura, closed the evening with two night ragas, his freewheeling virtuosity focusing attention on a single melodic line inflected with infinite imaginative variety.</p>",
  "<p>When it comes to cultural icons, few would mention Manchester City in the same breath as the Louvre. But to Abu Dhabi's royal family the football club is the latest in a string of multibillion-dollar acquisitions designed to rebrand the nation as a oasis of western culture in the Gulf.</p> <p>The Middle East state is spending billions of dollars buying the rights to internationally recognised cultural brands, including a deal to build the first branch of the Parisian art gallery outside France and the world's largest Guggenheim. Work is also under way on a Ferrari theme park in collaboration with the Italian sports car company, while the first ever Picasso exhibition currently on show in the Middle East features 186 paintings, drawings and sculptures from the Mus\u00e9e National Picasso in Paris.</p> <p>The vast wealth of the United Arab Emirates stems from the discovery of almost 10% of the world's oil reserves beneath its sands, and the leaders of Abu Dhabi - the second most populous city in the UAE - have established The Office of the Brand of Abu Dhabi to attract \"cultural seekers\" who \"crave authenticity, exclusivity, quality\".</p> <p>Until the 1960s the tiny kingdom did not have a metalled road and was sustained mainly by camel herding, farming, fishing and pearl diving in the Gulf. Then came the oil wealth, now being spent on infrastructure to the tune of $200bn (\u00a31.1bn) in the next seven years.</p> <p>When he signed the 30-year deal to use the Louvre name on a gallery designed by French architect Jean Nouvel, Sheikh Khalifa, ruler of Abu Dhabi, heralded \"a major achievement in Abu Dhabi's vision to become a world-class destination bridging global cultures\" which will \"create an enriching environment to be treasured by and to educate generations to come\". </p> <p>It has been reported that the emirate has paid $548m to use the Louvre name and is expected to pay an additional $788m for management advice and art loans from the Louvre and other French museums, including the Pompidou Centre and the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay.</p> <p>The Louvre will be built on Saadiyat Island (Happiness Island), a new cultural district in the Arabian gulf connected to Abu Dhabi city by a 10-lane highway. It will also feature the Guggenheim - to be designed by Frank Gehry - a new concert hall by Zaha Hadid, the British architect of the London 2012 aquatics centre, and a national museum named in honour of the late ruler, Sheikh Zayed, to be built by Lord Foster. Japanese architect Tadao Ando is designing a maritime museum to complete what government officials call \"one of the most impressive constellations of cultural attractions ever assembled\".</p> <p>Sheikh Khalifa's brother, Sheikh Mohammed, said Saadiyat Island would help \"interconnected global understanding\" and create the world's largest cultural destination across 27 sq km. The Guggenheim, Louvre and national museum are due to open before 2013.</p> <p>\"They have realised they cannot go on by simply distributing oil wealth to their population and so the idea is to turn Abu Dhabi into a sophisticated, internationally renowned viable state,\" said Professor Gerd Nonneman, director of the Institute of Arab and Islamic Studies at Exeter University. \"They are also hoping to use this as a way of attracting higher level expatriates because they suffer from a massive skills shortage.\"</p> <p>A branch of the Sorbonne, France's most prestigious university, has already opened in a deal partly intended to set a new benchmark for standards of higher education. Nonneman added that Abu Dhabi's ruling family was also motivated by a battle of \"one-upmanship\" with Dubai, a neighbouring emirate which \"has stolen the limelight\" with its hedonistic mix of hotels, shopping malls and theme parks which attract hundreds of thousands of expatriates and tourists. By contrast, Abu Dhabi aims to become \"a beacon of general culture\", he said. </p> <p>That is an approach that seems crass to some. Peter York, the branding expert, said Abu Dhabi's tactic of acquiring international cultural brands was \"like building Venice in Las Vegas.</p> <p>\"It just looks like they have wandered into the first shop they have seen and bought what is there and we in the west tend to make fun of people who do that,\" he said. \"They are buying what we call 'borrowed interest' and that can work, but if you are trying to convince sophisticated people in sophisticated economies that you too are a sophisticated economy, it is not enough. What really matters to inward investors are things like governance and the availability of an adaptable and highly educated workforce.\"</p> <p>Abu Dhabi's embrace of western cultural brands has proved controversial. In France more than 5,000 intellectuals signed a petition against the deal with the Louvre arguing that \"museums are not for sale\", and Nonneman said conservative elements in nearby Muslim states such as Saudi Arabia could object to the display of art for entertainment.</p> <p>But the real audience is foreigners. \"They are people who use travel to enrich themselves, always seeking new experiences in new countries, and they have enough money to go wherever they choose,\" said the Office of the Brand of Abu Dhabi. \"They want unique experiences that feed their sense of discovery. They reject the sameness that increasingly dominates their lives ... they crave authenticity, exclusivity, quality.\"</p> <h2>Growth strategy</h2> <p>Abu Dhabi's 60-year-old ruler, Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahyan has a personal fortune estimated at $23bn (\u00a312.7bn) by Forbes magazine but presides over a national fortune that is far greater. Sheikh Khalifa is president of the emirate's Supreme Petroleum Council. He is also chairman of the Abu Dhabi Fund for Development and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority. He is seen as a pro-western moderniser who loves the traditional pastimes of Arab royalty: falconry, fishing, horse and camel racing, as well as reading history and poetry. His father took control of the emirate in 1966 and realised it could be transformed with oil wealth. Sheikh Khalifa said he learned from him \"the need for patience and prudence in all things\". He works with his brother Sheikh Mohammed al-Nahyan on a modernisation programme which observers say includes an emerging meritocracy rare in the region. They are developing the technology to supply zero-carbon energy. The Masdar initiative envisages a new walled city powered by renewable energy to be built by 2023.</p>",
  "<p>Honey has left <strong>EastEnders </strong>(BBC1). Though, of course, she was not quite all there in the first place. Billy, her husband, has been described by a kindly relative as \"a man of limited ability and little better than an oik\". Frankly, I wouldn't trust either of them to sit the right way on a toilet. </p> <p>Last night Billy and Honey, having come into dodgy money, kindly decided to give it to charity. They stuffed \u00a310,000 into a plump brown paper envelope and posted it in the pillar box in Albert Square. A few minutes' mourning was implied. I confidently expect the imminent arrival in EastEnders of an ex-postman, a man of ample means, if shifty demeanour. Perhaps he will buy Jack's house, which is currently on the market as \"a stunning period property in a quiet residential square\". Where this peaceful square is, I can't imagine. </p> <p><strong>Three Minute Wonder </strong>(Channel 4) is, like Jack Dee, on the short side and none the worse for that. It just brushes the subject of people who work at night. The music sounds like a city breathing in its sleep, and each story has something slightly unsettling about it. </p> <p>Monday's woman was Mother Xavier of the nuns of Tyburn, who likes to pray by night because she feels as if she has God's undivided attention then. Sometimes the nuns hear shrieks from the street and then they pray all the harder for the suffering. Tyburn's terrible reputation was never mentioned, but it is precisely the place you might expect to hear shrieks at night. Tuesday's woman was Ursula, who sweeps the platforms of St Pancras (where, if I remember aright, Boadicea is said to be buried). One night she saw a man shooting pigeons and thought it odd. Tonight Alan, an old bargee, who trundles sand and gravel up the Thames, says you see strange things on the river at night. </p> <p>Shrieks and shots and strange things. Three Minute Wonder gives your imagination elbow room. And, just above and below the elbow, goosebumps.</p> <p><strong>True Stories: Four Wives, One Man </strong>(More4) began: \"The Qur'an says marry four wives if you can afford it.\" I misread that as \"The Queen says . . . \" and was quite taken aback. Heda is a bluff Iranian farmer. We don't do bluff much any more. It suggests a man who has never stubbed his toe against the word no. He has four wives, 20 children and an old mother with a taste for rude jokes, and it slowly became clear that he could not quite afford it. (\"Four fridges and four houses! If I had one wife, I'd have a nice car.\") </p> <p>Heda is human. He chases the swarming boys (\"Stop it or I'll give you a hiding!\"), complains about the bills (\"The water bill is huge!\") and finds fault with the cooking (\"Macaroni isn't real food\"), but little children hold out their arms to him. </p> <p>The land was like grit. The skies were enormous and empty. A lame dog hobbled round the yard. You could taste the dust. Personally, I would have tried drilling for oil. </p> <p>Over their leisurely acquaintance, Nahid Persson, the director, was absorbed into the family. Farang, Goli, Shahpar and Ziba confided in her. Not one of them was happy. The last wife was always the favoured one. (\"When you buy a new jumper, you don't wear the old one.\") Shahpar, who had been beautiful, threatened to stone Ziba, who was still beautiful. Ziba threatened to kill herself because she was barren. \"Last night as Heda slept I felt desperate for a child. I prayed and cried and cried and have had a headache all day.\" Wearing mourning dress, she went to a shrine and prayed. \"Give me a child so my husband won't take another wife.\" </p> <p>When Nahib returned two years later, Ziba had a baby. Shahpar, astonishingly, had given her one. \"This way the child is with her father more. When my son called for his daddy, he was with his new wife and wouldn't open the door.\" There was jealous jockeying for their children's interests. The rows were of a ferocity to scorch your eyebrows. Heda replied with his fists and feet and grumbles. \"The more wives you have, the more uppity they get. Two of them were married before. A virgin is best. You say it's day, it's day. You say it's night, she agrees.\" </p> <p>A long white shimmering road led out of the village.

  "<p>The Republican presidential candidate, John McCain, sought to put his party convention back on track yesterday after losing most of the first day because of Hurricane Gustav.</p> <p>George Bush, who had been due to make the primetime speech to the convention on Monday, was scheduled to address delegates last night by video from the White House. But the president was relegated to a minor role, taken off the primetime slot and his speech cut from 15 minutes to six. Some other events planned for Monday were ditched altogether.</p> <p>The primetime speakers scheduled for last night were not Bush but Fred Thompson, the former Law and Order actor who ran for the nomination against McCain, and Joe Lieberman, the former Democrat and now an independent who is a close friend of McCain.</p> <p>The reduced role for Bush suits McCain. While the president remains popular with most Republicans, according to polls, he is unpopular in the country at large, and McCain is keen to keep his distance.</p> <p>In excerpts of Bush's comments, published in advance, he focuses on McCain's potential as commander-in-chief. \"We live in a dangerous world. And we need a president who understands the lessons of September 11 2001: that to protect America, we must stay on the offence, stop attacks before they happen, and not wait to be hit again.\"</p> <p>But Bush also had an eye on his own legacy. He took the credit for the surge of US troops to Iraq that he claims has reduced violence, even though McCain advocated such a policy well before Bush. Instead, he confined himself to praising McCain for supporting the surge from the Senate.</p> <p>The job of both Thompson and Lieberman was to fill out McCain's biography, just as Michelle Obama and others did for Barack Obama last week at the start of the Democratic convention in Denver.</p> <p>In excerpts released in advance, Thompson was gushing, describing McCain as \"the kind of character that civilisations from the beginning of history have sought in their leaders\", who would \"restore integrity to our government\" - seemingly oblivious to the fact it has been in Republican hands for the last eight years.</p> <p>McCain cancelled the first day of the convention while the Gulf coast was struck by the hurricane, and he headed to the region. But, with New Orleans having escaped the devastation wrought by Katrina in 2005, he was anxious for the convention to fully resume, and to secure primetime TV audiences. Only a third of the delegates turned up on Monday for two hours of procedural business and a brief appearance by Laura Bush and McCain's wife, Cindy, both appealing for funds for victims of the hurricane.</p> <p>The normal bustle was expected to start last night, though organisers said they wanted the tone to stay subdued, and there would be little in the way of attacks on Obama.</p> <p>The convention organisers said they had not yet finalised the programme for today and tomorrow, both of which have also had to be rewritten, but confirmed McCain would deliver his speech accepting the nomination in person and not by satellite, the back-up plan if Hurricane Gustav had proved catastrophic and he had remained in the region.</p> <p>The rollcall of delegates to formally nominate McCain is to be held tonight.</p> <p>With McCain and Obama virtually level in the polls and Obama having received no or only a slight poll rise from the convention, McCain is hoping he will get the bounce where Obama failed.</p> <p>Almost all of yesterday was devoted to the schmaltz that seems to appeal to US audiences: hour after hour of sentimental details about McCain's life, from Cindy's adoption of a Bangladeshi child, to a former Vietnam prisoner of war describing their time together in jail in Hanoi.</p> <p>Thompson was to talk about \"the courage and essence\" of McCain, while Lieberman spoke of him as \"the original maverick\" with a history of bucking the Republican line, part of the reason he is viewed with suspicion by many delegates.</p> <p>McCain is hoping Lieberman will help win over independents who want to see a more bipartisan approach in Washington.</p>",
  "<p>When Dennis Wise and Tony Jimenez joined the payroll at St James' Park in January, Chris Mort, the then Newcastle United chairman, revealed how their appointments represented \"part of the vision that helped us to secure Kevin Keegan's return\". Less than eight months later and many on Tyneside would believe Wise and Jimenez have had quite the opposite effect, with Keegan clinging to his job after another mind-boggling 24 hours at Newcastle.</p> <p>Managing Newcastle has long been regarded as \"the impossible job\", but the current structure at St James' Park has given that phrase a whole new meaning. Never mind coping with the supporters' unrealistic expectations, the biggest hurdle for Keegan, or for his replacement for that matter, would appear to be adapting to a chain of command where the power base lies in London, not the north-east, and the manager is expected to pick the team but not the players he works with.</p> <p>That has been the reality for Keegan, whose authority was undermined from the moment Wise was named as Newcastle's executive director (football) and Jimenez given the task of overseeing player recruitment. Keegan had known about the owner Mike Ashley's intentions to change the club's staff around but Wise's name was something of a surprise. It was a sign of things to come as Keegan came to realise he did not have to be stood on the training pitches at Newcastle to feel isolated.</p> <p>Sources claim key decisions have been taken at Newcastle, both last and this season, with little or no regard being given to Keegan's thoughts, as Wise and Jimenez sought to pursue alternative transfer targets while also refusing to negotiate new contracts with players the manager had wanted to keep. The futures of Joey Barton, James Milner and Michael Owen all divided opinion, leaving Keegan feeling frustrated and powerless as he has struggled to make his voice heard.</p> <p>Indeed, so poor are the lines of communication between London and Newcastle that there are stories of Keegan and Terry McDermott, the assistant manager at St James' Park, turning up to watch a player without knowing that Wise and Jimenez were also attending the game with the same intention. It must have been one of the few occasions - other than the peacekeeping summits Ashley has called - when Keegan, Wise and Jimenez could be found within 100 yards of each other. </p> <p>A rift has long developed with Keegan identifying Premier League players with a proven track record to reinvigorate Newcastle while Wise and Jimenez, anxious to reduce the wage bill, looked overseas, to South America and recently Spain, for new faces. Xisco, the Spain Under-21 international, and Ignacio Gonz\u00e1lez, who has joined from Valencia on a season-long loan, were not the arrivals Keegan had in mind when he talked about signing \"four quality players\" before the window closed.</p> <p>The problems are no surprise to some. \"I think it started off with a plan that was already flawed in that firstly they [Keegan and Wise and Jimenez] were not picking the players together,\" said one agent who has brokered deals with the club this year. \"Secondly, you have got a Newcastle and London base. Thirdly, there is an old-fashioned manager, in Keegan, who likes to be hands-on, working with Wise and Jimenez. Fourthly, it is obvious that [Wise and Jimenez] were dictating.\"</p> <p>That explosive mix was just about under control when Mort was at the club, but keeping a lid on the tension has proved impossible since he stepped down in May. Diplomatic skills were never Wise's strong point - Sir Alex Ferguson once said the former Chelsea midfielder \"could start an argument in an empty house\" - while Keegan has demonstrated in the past that he is not averse to speaking from the heart. The Newcastle manager got it wrong, however, when he said, \"I know [this club] inside out\" when he returned in January.</p>",
  "<p>On Russia, at least, Gordon Brown, David Cameron and Nick Clegg think alike. Belatedly and perhaps emptily, all three party leaders have condemned the invasion of Georgia and demanded a tough response. Yet a different and even odder alliance is taking shape on the other side. Its members include such unlikely figures as Andrew Murray of Stop the War Coalition, David Davies, the Tory MP for Monmouth, and historian Correlli Barnett, as well as anonymous but influential City bankers and lawyers.</p> <p>The Kremlin's most constant allies are the old pro-Soviet left: people such as Bob Wareing, the veteran leftwing MP for Liverpool, West Derby. He recalls warmly the wartime alliance with Stalin's Soviet Union, and the promise of social justice in the communist system. In the Morning Star, Andrew Murray blames the war in Georgia on American imperialism and contrasts it with the success of \"Soviet nationalities policy\" in promoting \"the cultural, linguistic and educational development of each ethnic group, no matter how small or how historically marginalised\". Chechens, Crimean Tatars and other victims of Stalin's murderous deportation policies presumably don't count.</p> <p>A simpler approach is pure Russophilia: people who love Russia's culture or language, and rejoice in what seems to be a national rebirth under Vladimir Putin. A wider group is sparked chiefly by anti-Americanism. If you hate George W Bush then you may cast a friendly glance on the people who make life difficult for him, such as Hugo Ch\u00e1vez of Venezuela, or Putin in Russia. It is countries such as Russia, however spiky and unattractive, that can derail the new world order. Yet that's odd. If, say, you feel that Muslims get a hard deal from America, then surely the Russian torture camps in Chechnya should make your blood boil?</p> <p>In odd alliance with the anti-globalists are the champions of international business: those who do well out of selling goods and services to Russia. In the City, investment banks, law firms, accountants and consultants have enjoyed a bonanza thanks to their Russian clients. Auditors such as PricewaterhouseCoopers have not flinched at doing the Kremlin's dirty work - for example in withdrawing their audit of Yukos, once Russia's biggest oil company, which conveniently coincided with Kremlin allegations of fraud. For this pinstriped fifth column, business is business, and worries about human rights or the rule of law are tiresome distractions.</p> <p>David Wilshire, a leading Conservative member of the Council of Europe parliamentary assembly, has lobbied hard to make Mikhail Margelov, a pro-Putin Russian parliamentarian who used to be a KGB language instructor, the next president of the organisation, which is supposedly devoted to promoting human rights. Then come those such as the polemical Peter Hitchens, who have no great liking for tycoons, but a deep admiration for the nation-state. He writes: \"I often wish we were more like Russia, aggressively defending our interests, making sure we owned our own crucial industries, killing terrorists instead of giving in to them, running our own foreign policy instead of trotting two feet behind George W Bush.\" Russia, he says, has come to stand for national sovereignty and independence, while we give up our own.</p> <p>Correlli Barnett praises the regime in Russia in a similar vein. In the past few days, for example, Barnett has said: \"World peace? Give me Putin any day!\"; and \"the West should jettison moral indignation and global do-goodery as the basis of policy, and instead emulate Russia's admirable reversion to 19th-century realpolitik\". The main motive here is dislike for the whole apparatus of modern diplomacy - multilateral organisations governed by international treaties and at least a notional commitment to human rights.</p> <p>It is all very odd. Russia is an oil-fuelled fascist kleptocracy ruled by secret police goons and their cronies. It is authoritarian: critics risk forcible incarceration in psychiatric hospitals, or are simply murdered - such as the shooting dead in police custody of Magomed Yevloyev, an Ingush journalist, this week. It is imperialist: bullying neighbours with oil and gas cut-offs, let alone the occupation of Georgia, where Russia's proxies have practised ethnic cleansing on a scale that recalls the atrocities of the wars in former Yugoslavia. And it is deeply corrupt and lawless: something that even Putin's successor as president, Dmitry Medvedev, has acknowledged publicly. However bad other countries may be, it is hard to find anything there worth emulating.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Edward Lucas is the author of The New Cold War: How the Kremlin Menaces Both Russia and the West </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:newcoldwar2008@gmail.com\">newcoldwar2008@gmail.com</a> </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.edwardlucas.com\">Edwardlucas.com</a></p>",
  "<p>It is a breach of etiquette for millionaires to talk money when there is a microphone in the vicinity. Jimmy Bullard, however, differs from the affluent others in the England squad because he can discuss earnings that are remarkable only for their insignificance. The Fulham midfielder was fully entitled to a touch of self-satisfaction when he recalled the \u00a360 a week that Gravesend and Northfleet once paid him in non-league football.</p> <p>No one can know when, or if, another player with that type of background will next come into consideration for an England cap. His ascent has obliged him to overcome other obstacles as well. After a dreadful knee injury at Newcastle United in September 2006 he could not return to action until the beginning of this year.</p> <p>\"There were a few dark times. I was in that gym wondering if I would ever kick a ball again professionally,\" said the 29-year-old. \"I had to show a great deal of strength and character to come back from the injury. It makes you a stronger person as well as a stronger footballer. To get back to playing and then to get called up [for England] is just brilliant.\"</p> <p>He is proud of the perseverance he showed to resume his career. The way had also seemed barred to him when he did not make the grade as a youngster at West Ham United. This week he is unexpectedly reunited with individuals he knew then. \"People like Joe Cole, Rio Ferdinand, Jermain Defoe and Glen Johnson were all there,\" he recalled. \"We've had some good chats about old times.\" </p> <p>It was as if he were the surprised subject of a This Is Your Life programme. The reminiscences welled up. He talked about the three years when he used to work as a painter and decorator with his father, who would give him a day off when an important match was imminent. \"It was quite a hard job,\" Bullard said, \"rubbing down walls and ceilings.\"</p> <p>His obscurity, it has to be conceded, is tending to be exaggerated at the moment. Two good years at Peterborough United earned him a move to Wigan Athletic and since promotion with them in 2005 the Premier League has been his place of work. His part in Fulham's win over Arsenal last month impressed the England manager, Fabio Capello. His liveliness catches the eye, even if coaches might prefer him to be more restrained on occasion.</p> <p>The absence of Steven Gerrard opened up a space for him in the squad and there is a chance that he will represent his country shortly. Frank Lampard, along with John Terry, Ashley Cole and Wes Brown, missed training yesterday - none of them is in serious difficulties but it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that Bullard will get on to the field at some point in Saturday's World Cup qualifier with Andorra in Barcelona.</p> <p>The prospect of him taking on Croatia in Zagreb four days later does defeat the imagination, but he can revel in the prospect of even being in the vicinity of that match. Hitherto, celebrated footballers may have been rather bewildered when in his company. When Fulham had a pre-season match with Real Madrid in Austria two years ago Ra\u00fal, David Beckham and the others were treated to a song from the guitar-playing Bullard in the hotel shared by the two clubs.</p> <p>He relishes whatever he does, often reaching a high standard. He has, for instance, played golf off scratch and he is a match angler. People respond to his spontaneity. \"I hope I am liked,\" he said. \"I play my football with a smile on my face. That's how I play my best football - I can't get too uptight. I just go out there and enjoy my football and enjoy life.\" </p> <p>There is, inescapably, a solemnity about England, and Bullard had hitherto joined the rest of the nation in agonised watching of international games on television. In that sense he has always been an onlooker, because he was not picked to represent England at any level whatsoever. This week's elevation takes some getting used to.</p> <p>He speaks about Capello shaking his hand and of the effect of donning new training gear bearing the three-lions badge. The practice sessions could not come soon enough. \"I was anxious,\" he said. \"I wanted to get out there on the pitch. That's where I feel at my most comfortable.\"</p> <p>He must be compulsively reliving the spell from the arrival of a letter last Wednesday, informing him that he was in contention for the squad, to confirmation of his selection on Sunday. All the same, he now has to stow those distracting memories away. Capello might yet have an assignment for him.</p> <h2>Another five shock selections</h2> <p><strong>Ian Callaghan</strong> Liverpool</p> <p>Called up by Ron Greenwood v Switzerland, Sept 7 1977</p> <p>Played against France in a 1966 World Cup group game and was recalled at the age of 35 when the new England manager, deciding to base his team on the European Cup winners, Liverpool, called up six of their English players and the just departed Kevin Keegan. Callaghan won one more cap before the experiment was dumped</p> <p><strong>John Fashanu</strong> Wimbledon</p> <p>Called up by Bobby Robson v Chile, May 23 1989</p> <p>End-of-season cry-offs opened the door for Fashanu to appear in a dour 0-0 draw, his appearance being one of the few talking points.

  "<p>Next month, the congregation of Granton United Church, north Edinburgh, hopes to get full planning permission to demolish its large place of worship. It wants to build on the site 15 affordable homes and a new church that is a more appropriate size for the dwindling number of parishioners, and which has lower maintenance costs. </p> <p>The affordable housing idea is borrowed from the United Reform Church (URC), in neighbouring Leith, which in 2005 sold its land to the Port of Leith Housing Association (POLHA) for \u00a3455,000, with the right to buy back a smaller and purpose-built church on the site for \u00a3330,000. \"We had two Victorian buildings - a church and a church hall - standing empty for much of the week,\" explains the Rev Leslie Morrison. \"We were financially unviable.\"</p> <p>The congregation rejected the idea of closing down, and the new smaller church, complete with community facilities, opened last year. Eighteen affordable one- and two-bedroom flats have been built above the church, and four three-bedroom houses behind it.</p> <p>Gemma Blackie and her partner were one of the first tenants to move into the Leith flats. They had been on the council's housing list for more than four years. \"It's a win-win situation,\" says Gordon Cameron, POLHA development director. </p> <p>Scottish Churches Housing Action (SCH), which brokered the deal between the Leith church and POLHA, holds up the redevelopment as an example of how church property - empty and underused buildings and land - could help address Scotland's affordable housing shortage. </p> <p>With funding from the Scottish executive, SCH has identified almost 50 similar examples across Scotland where there are small and ageing congregations, churches too big for their needs, and maintenance costs that they cannot justify or afford. Interest in the land use scheme seems to be catching on. To date, it has received 41 inquiries; an additional 21 are at feasibility stage, and seven are nearing completion. </p> <p>But what is stopping many more from following suit? One of the reasons more churches do not consider the idea, says SCH chief executive Alastair Cameron, is that churches feel they are obliged by law to maximise the value of their assets when they sell them. As a result, affordable housing is only considered as a last resort, when selling on the open market does not work. But clarification from the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator - and repeated by the Charity Commission - to the charity Housing Justice, which is doing a similar exercise south of the border, indicates that maximising value need not be the driving factor in a sale. Instead, trustees' primary responsibility is to their constitution and the doctrine of their religion, and only if these are not being furthered does the full market value have to be sought. Cameron now wants \"systematic cooperation from churches, rather than ad hoc support\". </p> <p>And he is not deterred by the credit crunch, which is making it harder for housing associations to secure funds. SCH's target, housing 130 people a year for the next 10 years. \"We anticipate short-term problems,\" he admits. \"But we're in this for the long haul. The problem of too many church buildings for too few worshippers will, I'm afraid, be with us even once the economy is recovering.\" </p> <p>Morrison is also convinced the model can be replicated. \"So many churches are not appropriate for the 21st century; they spend too much time and effort maintaining buildings beyond their sell-by date.\"</p> <p>The redevelopment of the URC in Leith, and clarification of the law, has excited the congregation of Granton United Church. \"Our treasurer said we could only last two more years,\" says Wilma Neilson, a member of the congregation. One remaining challenge is to find a suitable place to worship while the proposed redevelopment takes place. \"We need to be positive and go forward in faith,\" says Neilson.</p> <p><strong> \u00b7 </strong><a href=\"http://www.churches-housing.org\">churches-housing.org</a></p>",
  "<p>Millionaire businessman Christopher Foster shot his wife and teenage daughter before killing himself in the family's blazing mansion, police confirmed yesterday.</p> <p>The head of the inquiry, Detective Superintendent Jon Groves, gave details of CCTV film showing a man thought to be Foster carrying a rifle, leaving outbuildings just before they burst into flame and blocking electronic gates with a horsebox before shooting out two of its tyres.</p> <p>The unhurried, deliberate actions were the endgame, police believe, of a desperate attempt by Foster to avoid financial ruin and public humiliation. He was so close to eviction from the family's \"dream estate\" that recovery procedures for more than \u00a31m in debts from his failed oil rig insulation business had begun.</p> <p>Remains of a man's body found at the weekend in tonnes of debris at Osbaston House near the hamlet of Maesbrook were identified yesterday as those of 50-year-old Foster. He was lying beside his wife Jill, 49, who had been shot in the head. Foster's .22 rifle lay nearby. The cause of his death is not yet known.</p> <p>Forensic work continues on the remains of a third body, found on Monday. Police believe it is that of 15-year-old Kirstie Foster, although this has not yet been confirmed. </p> <p>Groves said police had decided to reveal details of the inquiry to end speculation and provide answers to the local community. Allegations of kidnap plots and Jill Foster inheriting a fortune were untrue and had added to the grief of the family's relatives and friends.</p> <p>\"We believe that Mr Foster killed his wife and daughter before setting the fires which destroyed his home and many of its outbuildings in the early hours of Tuesday,\" said Groves. \"We believe he then took his own life after setting the house alight. </p> <p>\"This was a terrible tragedy and our thoughts remain with the families of the Fosters at this time.\"</p> <p>Martin Timmis, head of operational response for Shropshire fire and rescue service, said there appeared to have been several seats to the fire.

  "<p>In 1981 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/vietnam\">Vietnam</a>'s ruling Communist party, the VCP, presented a choice to the country's Buddhist monks. They could affiliate to a state-controlled \"patriotic\" Buddhist church, or remain independent and face the consequences. Many accepted, but not Thich Huyen Quang, a leader of the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam (UBCV), who has died, aged 87. He suffered harassment, imprisonment and internal exile, but he also found international recognition as a moral leader of the Vietnamese opposition.</p> <p>Born Le Dinh Nhan in central Vietnam, he entered a monastery aged 12 and received the name Huyen Quang at his ordination - \"Thich\" is a title used by Vietnamese monks. He was a brilliant student, but from the start his Buddhist practice included a commitment to society. He supported resistance to French colonial rule, but when communists gained control in the north he opposed their attempts to control religion and was imprisoned between 1951 and 1954.</p> <p>Quang was in South Vietnam in 1963 when Buddhists were caught between the attacking communists and the south's Roman Catholic Ngo Dinh Diem regime. Seeing the need for Buddhists to work together, he helped to found the UBCV, which combined 11 sects and claimed the support of most Vietnamese people. Quang threw himself into the new church's opposition to Diem, helped to develop its network of hospitals and schools and represented it at the Paris peace talks.</p> <p>After the 1975 communist victory in the Vietnam war, the VCP tried to destroy Vietnamese Buddhism altogether. UBCV property was confiscated and leaders including Quang were arrested - he spent 18 months in solitary confinement. International protests followed and, in 1978, he and his colleague, Thich Quang Do, were nominated for the Nobel peace prize.</p> <p>The years of opposition to Diem had toughened the South Vietnam Buddhists and the UBCV's social work had won them support, so Buddhism did not crumble there as it had in the north. When Quang and other UBCV leaders refused to join the patriotic church he was sent, in 1982, to a remote temple. Later he was isolated entirely in a small house on a deserted patch of farmland accessible only by ox cart.</p> <p>In 1992 the UBCV leader died and Huyen Quang became the church's fourth patriarch. The regime launched a new crackdown on UBCV activities and anyone found possessing one of Huyen's speeches was arrested. More than 40,000 Buddhists marched through the central Vietnamese city of Hue in protest.</p> <p>Quang had become Vietnam's leading religious dissident, and he produced a series of articles calling for religious freedom and the end of communist supremacy. Western human rights groups took up his cause and, eventually, the Vietnamese government sought an accommodation. In 2003 he was summoned to meet Vietnam's prime minister, who apologised for the VCP's \"mistakes\" in its treatment of Buddhism. During this brief thaw Quang was greeted by rapturous crowds in Hue, and a new UBCV leadership was formed. But renewed suppression followed. As his health failed he was allowed to move to the monastery in Binh Dinh, where he eventually died.</p> <p>Quang's final message to Buddhists two months before his death expressed the creed by which he had lived: \"Buddhism does not turn its back on society.\" Earlier he had said of himself: \"I have lived without a home, will die without a grave, I walk without a path and am imprisoned without a crime.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Thich Huyen Quang (Le Dinh Nhan), dissident and Buddhist leader, born September 19 1920; died July 5 2008</p>",
  "<p>The idea of a Mental Patients Union was first developed by a small group of mental patients and supporters back in December 1972. A pamphlet was produced \u2014 which came to be known as the Fish Pamphlet (it had a picture of a fish struggling on a hook on the cover) \u2014 that was strongly Marxist in its analysis. Its argument was that psychiatry was a form of social control of the working classes in a capitalist state, and that the psychiatrist was the \"high priest\" of technological society, exorcising the \"devils\" of social distress through electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), lobotomy and medication. The thinking was that, in the same way that workers formed trade unions, mental patients also needed a union to fight for their rights against political oppression and social control. </p> <p>There were six of us involved in setting up the union: Liz Durkin, Brian Douieb, Lesley Mitchell, Eric Irwin, me and my partner Valerie Argent, but only Eric, Valerie and I were mental patients. Valerie and I were mainly focused on forming the union. We didn't participate in the political analysis, or sign the Fish Pamphlet.</p> <p>The group planned to hold its first public meeting at Paddington day hospital, where Liz had been a social worker. She had been making contact with the press to promote the cause for a Mental Patients Union. The idea of the union caught the fancy of Radio 4's Today programme and they asked her to come and talk about it on the programme on the morning of the meeting. Liz realised they were asking her because she was a social worker, but at a \"council of war\" meeting we decided we wouldn't take part unless they agreed to interview a patient \u2014 and that we wouldn't give them any information about the patient, whether they were from Broadmoor or whatever. We had this idea that we'd line up in the studio and say: \"Spot the loony.\" They took three or four hours to ring us and agree to interview a patient. They needed time to think about that.</p> <p>In the end, I was the only one of the three of us with mental health problems willing to do it. At the studio, it was all very civilised. The interviewer's main question was: \"How could patients possibly form a union \u2013 if they were sick, how could they take part in something like that?\" In those days it was radical to suggest that people with mental health problems could do things together as an association. </p> <p>The response after the broadcast was overwhelming. I gave out my home number on air and from the moment the interview went out, the telephone was ringing.</p> <p>We had only booked a small room at the hospital for the meeting later that evening. More than 100 people turned up and there wasn't room for us all. It was chaos and they found us a bigger room. Some people picked up the Fish Pamphlet and were asking if, to join the union, they had to share its analysis. We told them no, those were just the views of one small group.</p> <p>We told them the union was about the dignity of mental patients, about being able to speak for ourselves and not having to talk about \"them\", because, in those days, if you were in any group and the subject of mental patients came up, everybody assumed you couldn't be one \u2014 you talked about \"them\", not \"us\".</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Andrew Roberts is a member of the management committee of the Survivor History Group</p>",
  "<p><strong>The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Thursday September 4 2008 </strong></p> <p> The headline of this article is incorrect as it does not reflect the article below, which said that unemployment had been falling for 15 years but rose this year.</p> <p> </p> <p>Britain's jobs market is suffering from the slowdown in the economy as a new report out today shows the number of permanent jobs available has plunged to its lowest level since 2001.</p> <p>Unemployment had been falling for 15 years to its lowest level for three decades, but has risen by about 70,000 this year. Economists say tumbling house prices and stagnant economic growth are likely to push unemployment up sharply over the next year or more.</p> <p>The Recruitment &amp; Employment Confederation's latest survey today says permanent placements contracted for the fifth consecutive month in August while temporary jobs fell for the first time since May 2003.</p> <p>\"The slide in the UK economy continues to hit the jobs market hard - with yet another sharp drop in recruitment,\" said Alan Nolan, director at KPMG, which sponsors the report. \"UK employers are continuing to control payroll costs through redundancies - and by refusing to take advantage of a growing (but increasingly unused) pool of skilled labour.\" </p> <p>He warned that skilled workers are starting to move abroad in search of employment, which could result in a labour shortage when the market picks up again. </p> <p>Thousands of jobs have been shed in the construction sector as the housing and commercial property markets have collapsed. Figures out yesterday showed that Britain's construction sector shrank for a sixth consecutive month in August.</p> <p>The Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply/Market construction index picked up slightly to 40.5 last month from a low of 36.7 in July, but remains in difficulties. A figure below 50 signifies contraction.</p> <p>David Blanchflower, a member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, said last week that there was a risk of unemployment rising by 60,000 a month and hitting 2 million by the turn of the year. </p> <p>\"We are going to see much more dramatic drops in output,\" said Blanchflower, who has been a lone voice on the nine-member MPC in calling for lower interest rates in recent months.</p> <p>In an interview with Reuters, he said: \"The fears that I have expressed over the past six months have started to come to fruition. I've obviously voted on quite a number of occasions now for small [quarter-point] cuts but we need to act and we probably need to act in larger amounts than that. We need to get ahead of the game and it appears that we are now behind.\"</p> <p>The Bank begins its two-day meeting today to deliberate on the level of interest rates. Borrowing costs have been unchanged at 5% since April as the MPC remains concerned about rising inflation.</p> <p>But many analysts believe that the Bank must cut rates this week to prevent a recession. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said yesterday that Britain will enter recession this year with contractions of economic output in the third and fourth quarters.</p> <p>The OECD predicted that the British economy will shrink by 0.3% this quarter and by 0.4% in the October to December period as the credit crunch and the housing market downturn worsen. Therefore, this would be two consecutive quarters of negative growth, which is commonly used as the definition of recession. The OECD said Britain would fare worst among the group of seven leading economies.</p> <p>Shadow chancellor George Osborne said: \"Not only is the British economy predicted to shrink in the next two quarters, but it is also the only economy not predicted by the OECD to see a recovery this year. All of our major competitors are predicted to see at least some growth by the end of the year.\"</p> <p>The Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman, Lord Oakeshott, said: \"Other big economies are forecast to recover but the OECD says Britain is worst placed of all because of falling house prices.</p> <p>\"British families are now paying through the nose for Gordon Brown's complacency, which has allowed house prices and debt to get out of hand.\"</p>",
  "<p>Most star TV reporters carry hairspray in their kitbag to help them look their best on camera. But, for those reporting from the levees of New Orleans this week, the barnet-hardener will have been redundant. This was a rare assignment when the journalists desperately wanted their locks, weaves or toupees to blow in the breeze.</p> <p>With hurricane Gustav unexpectedly downgraded from a category four to a category one storm, an unruly rug was the only way they had of suggesting that New Orleans was really windy. For the same reason, many reporters kept their jackets open, calculating that flapping cloth might also intimate an impending gale.</p> <p>\"The levees seem to be enough for now,\" conceded the BBC's Matthew Price, although we all knew he was there in anticipation of the opposite outcome.</p> <p>We have to be wary of giggling at a news event in which at least eight people have died (although UK and US television paid little attention to the 90 killed as Gustav swept across the Caribbean), but the live coverage of the levees failing to provide the expected excitement demonstrates the biggest risk of all-day live news: the moments when the story fails to do what was written on the planning board.</p> <p>Television, though, has little choice. Ever since the Kennedy assassination was filmed by a tourist because network crews saw no point in shooting another presidential motorcade, news organisations have been obsessed with being in position. And now nimble equipment and 24-hour networks increase this need to keep going even when the story isn't.</p> <p>Newspapers also chase false geese, but can quietly withdraw their under-used personnel and print something else. While they bear the bruises of false alarms only on internal budgets, TV is forced to transmit its miscalculations. Stricter health and safety regulations also now keep reporters further from the action: there's no swaying on wave-lashed sea-breaks like there used to be. And so, on Gustav duty, the telly people's special wet-weather gear was at risk of splashing only from tears of frustration.</p>",
  "<p>My wife thinks I'll get stabbed one day. She thinks I get too angry about things I should let pass; she suspects that offering advice to those failing to observe basic social niceties is more provocative than helpful. She's not sure what I achieve by asking people to pick up their litter, or grabbing shoplifters, or asking a man in the doorway of McDonald's to stop hitting his girlfriend.</p> <p>Part of me thinks she's right, and that my blood pressure would fall if I turned away. But then another side - for the sake of argument, let's call it a conscience - kicks in. The things I get mad about diminish our society and lower the quality of life. Isn't it my duty to pipe up? In fact, shouldn't more people intervene? After all, isn't the wellbeing of society the responsibility of the whole of society?</p> <p>It turns out I'm not alone. The thinktank Reform says Britons are too ready to abdicate responsibility for dealing with wrongdoing - that we have \"nationalised and politicised\" antisocial behaviour to such an extent that we have become a \"nation of bystanders\": six out of 10 of us would not step in to stop a group of teenage vandals. We think our duties end with calling the police; in other European countries tackling antisocial behaviour is seen as everyone's responsibility.</p> <p>We do turn our backs because - like my wife - we believe the likely consequence of any intervention will be a stabbing. This despite the British Crime Survey showing that knife crime has remained stable over the past decade, and a Metropolitan Police survey showing that knife crime in London has actually dropped over the past two years, by a startling 15.7%.</p> <p>The saddest thing for those of us who believe it is right to intervene is that we get branded as rightwing, law-and-order-obsessed vigilantes. In fact, we're trying to uphold the classic leftwing value: that we are all responsible for the society we live in. It's not, whatever David Cameron might say, the Labour government to blame for the I'll-do-what-I-want culture that most of us blame for antisocial behaviour. After all, it wasn't a Labour prime minister who said, \"There's no such thing as society,\" was it?</p>",
  "<p>Two thousand British troops yesterday completed one of the most ambitious projects undertaken by foreign forces in Afghanistan, leading a 100-vehicle convoy to deliver an electricity turbine that could help to transform the lives of those they have been struggling for years to win over.</p> <p>In what British military officials described as their biggest mine clearance operation since the second world war, they helped move the large turbine to a hydroelectric dam on the Kajaki reservoir, north of Helmand province.</p> <p>Soldiers taking part in the operation said they were frequently attacked during the journey and an estimated 250 Taliban fighters were killed. The foreign forces suffered a single casualty - the pelvis of a British soldier was crushed when a trailer collapsed on top of him. </p> <p>The Chinese turbine, funded by the US, was flown on Russian aircraft into Kandahar, 100 miles away. From there the 200-tonne machine was transported in seven sections on a journey which took five days. The convoy was protected by more than 4,000 British, US, Canadian, Australian, and Afghan troops and special forces, accompanied by helicopters, jets and heavy armour. </p> <p>Lt Col Dave Wilson, commanding officer of the 23rd Engineer Regiment, called it a \"huge achievement\". He added: \"It was carried out through some of the most heavily mined areas of Afghanistan.\" </p> <p>With special forces deployed ahead to search for insurgents along the River Helmand valley, military engineers and a British Pathfinder reconnaissance team prepared a route, codenamed Harriet, through dry rivers and mountain passes, defence officials said.</p> <p>They had asked journalists not to report the long-planned mission until it was over. The turbine parts were hidden under metal sheeting which were covered in posters with verses from the Koran.</p> <p>The plan now is for Chinese engineers to install the turbine at the Kajaki dam, which would triple the output of the plant to 53 megawatts, British defence officials said. Protecting the plant has been a dangerous task for British and US troops as Taliban commanders have targeted it over recent years. </p> <p>\"This is a significant military operation which demonstrates that our strategy of delivering civil effect is making progress in southern Afghanistan,\" said Lt Col David Reynolds, spokesman for British forces in Helmand. \"Ultimately success in Afghanistan is about more than defeating the Taliban or the absence of fighting. It's also about creating jobs, security and economic development.\"</p> <p>British officials said they hoped around 1.8 million Afghans would benefit from the project. However, this could take some years while electricity transmission lines are laid.</p> <p>The Taliban has controlled and imposed taxes on areas where there are existing power lines, and British commanders have expressed concern that there will not be enough British or other Nato troops to prevent the Taliban from re-establishing control of the road to Kajaki.</p> <p>News of the operation to deliver the turbine came as David Cameron, the Conservative leader, who was on a visit to Helmand province yesterday, said British troops were getting a raw deal over their leave. He said the period of leave should start when personnel arrived home, rather than when they departed from operations. Flights back from Afghanistan can be delayed for days before reaching the UK, partly because of mechanical problems with the RAF's ageing transport aircraft.</p> <p>Cameron said: \"[Troops] should be able to predict how long their leave is going to be rather than having to spend it on an aeroplane and on air bases a long way from home.\" </p> <p>Lt Col Joe O'Sullivan, commanding officer of the 2nd battalion The Parachute Regiment, which has suffered a number casualties, including deaths, in southern Afghanistan recently, said that when leave started was an issue. </p> <p>\"Some of the soldiers have ended up going home via Iraq, which was quite ironic for them,\" he said. </p> <p>He also referred to the cases of two soldiers from his regiment who had been let down by their \"administrative care\" at Birmingham Selly Oak hospital, where they were recovering from injuries. The family of one of them who came to visit from Canada was turned away because it was outside visiting hours. When the other was discharged, he was made to walk two miles to the nearest cash point to get money for a taxi home. </p> <p>Cameron said there had been progress in Afghanistan, but there were still concerns such as a shortage of helicopters and the unwillingness of some Nato countries to play their full part in operations.</p> <p>Brigadier Mark Carleton-Smith, the commander of British forces in Afghanistan, described the delivery of the turbine as the \"end of the beginning\" of the campaign against the Taliban. \"We understand the problems here much more clearly,\" he said. \"We have a strategy that looks as though it may work.\"</p> <p>But he said Britain should expect to have a military presence in Afghanistan for \"another three to five years\".</p>",
  "<p>Authorities on America's Gulf Coast were yesterday struggling to orchestrate the orderly return of nearly 2 million evacuees to New Orleans and low-lying areas of Louisiana in the wake of Hurricane Gustav.</p> <p>Officials credited the exodus from New Orleans, one of the largest evacuations in American history, for the relatively low loss of life. Eight people were killed in the US as a result of the hurricane.</p> <p>But with Gustav past, Louisiana's governor, Bobby Jindal, yesterday faced the equally epic challenge of negotiating a peaceful and safe return of 95% of the population of southern Louisiana, now scattered in northern areas of the state, Texas and Tennessee. The evacuees would not be allowed to go home until today at the earliest, officials said.</p> <p>With more hurricanes forming over the Atlantic - Hanna was chewing up the Bahamas en route to Florida and South Carolina yesterday - the authorities were also under pressure to make sure that the public do not see the relatively light toll of Gustav as an excuse to ignore future evacuation warnings.</p> <p>\"The reason that you are not seeing a dramatic series of rescues is because we had an efficient evacuation,\" Michael Chertoff, the secretary for homeland security, said. \"I wouldn't want to give the impression that a category three storm is a false alarm.\"</p> <p>Though weakened, Gustav inflicted considerable property damage on Louisiana. Some 1.4m homes, and even a number of hospitals, were without power yesterday. Trees and dangling power lines were strewn across roads and the water and sewage systems in some small towns were knocked out of action.</p> <p>The damage could make it difficult or unsafe for evacuees to return to their homes, and officials pleaded for patience. \"Re-entry is just days away, but residents shouldn't return Tuesday. Trees are down all over the city, power lines are down all over the city, and there is a significant number of homes and businesses without energy,\" said Ray Nagin, the mayor of New Orleans.</p> <p>Nagin, who issued repeated doomsday predictions ahead of Gustav's arrival, brushed off criticism that he had exaggerated the potential for danger.</p> <p>\"I would not do a thing differently,\" the mayor told CBS television. \"I'd probably call Gustav, instead of the mother of all storms, maybe the mother-in-law or the ugly sister of all storms.\"</p> <p>More than 1,800 people were killed three years ago in the aftermath of Katrina, and scenes of stranded flood victims became a symbol of the indifference and incompetence of the Bush administration as well as the state authorities.</p> <p>But while authorities were priding themselves on their response to Gustav yesterday, the storm still exposed the vulnerability of New Orleans, despite the billions spent shoring up the system of levees and floodwalls since 2005.</p> <p>Although the winds barely reached hurricane force, water still poured over the top of floodwalls on the western Industrial Canal - the same canal whose collapse led to the flooding of New Orleans's Ninth Ward during Katrina.</p> <p>At a press conference yesterday, Jindal sketched out a plan for a phased return to New Orleans and other low-lying areas, starting today or tomorrow with shop owners and workers for major companies.</p> <p>The authorities were lining up hundreds of buses to pick up the evacuees and return them as close as possible to their homes. \"We're going to reverse the process. We had buses, trains and planes getting people out, now they're going to be bringing people back in,\" Nagin said.</p> <p>Those evacuees with their own transport would be allowed back once each local parish gives the all clear. The thousands who were evacuated by the authorities by bus and train would have to wait their turn. The elderly or those with medical conditions would be the last to return.</p> <p>Anyone attempting to drive back into New Orleans before then would be sent back by police.</p> <p>\"They will be detained and turned around,\" a spokesman for Jindal said. \"Then they could get in a situation where they run out of fuel. We're really saying to people, they need to stay where they are. Returning home too soon could prove dangerous because of downed power lines, standing floodwater and trees and other debris on major roadways.\"</p> <p>In Shreveport, Louisiana, there were reports overnight of fights at an overcrowded shelter. </p> <p>Others seemed unfazed by Jindal's warnings. By mid-morning, one elderly woman in Lafayette was already packing up her car to return to her home in Morgan City, with her husband, a kidney patient.</p> <p>The couple live in Morgan City, a centre for offshore drilling, that was hit badly by Gustav. Neighbours had told them their roof was damaged and their house was without power, but they were determined to return.</p> <p>\"Tomorrow is my husband's last day before he needs his dialysis again. We have to find some place where we can have it, so we are just going to go home and see,\" she said.</p>",
  "<p>At last, a glimmer of sanity. Faced with what is said to be the greatest collapse in the housing market of modern times, the government has decided to do virtually nothing. Excellent.</p> <p>Housing policy is like law and order. It brings out the idiot in politicians - and journalists. Of all the markets in which ministers might be tempted to meddle at the onset of recession, the last should be that for houses. And if houses it is, they should not waste public money to make them cheaper when prices are already falling. The purpose of government policy should be to achieve some market stability, not to drive prices lower by increasing supply.</p> <p>Yet this government is doing just that, in the same way as it drove up prices during the boom by hyping demand. Those whom the gods wish to destroy, they first let dabble in markets. But the proposals announced by the prime minister yesterday were at least paltry: they should do little damage and perhaps even a tiny bit of good.</p> <p>A limited stamp duty holiday is a sound short-term measure which estate agents claim will kick a few thousand deals into play and thus steady the plummeting lower end of the market. With house sales at a 30-year low, a move like this is worth trying.</p> <p>At the same time Gordon Brown should have cleared some of the bureaucratic clutter that now infests house purchase. Chief is the home information pack, a costly and redundant gimmick from a former housing minister, Yvette Cooper (now at the Treasury) eager to meddle. It has merely imposed another transaction tax on house purchase.</p> <p>The proposal to \"nationalise\" equity for some of those facing dispossession is a modest welfare measure. It is a new housing benefit for the home-owning classes whereby a small percentage of debt is shifted to the public purse, covered by a means test administered by a new cohort of government \"money advisers\". It might keep a few thousand householders out of bed and breakfast for a while. From Brown, formerly a vociferous foe of means testing, it is a spectacular volte face.</p> <p>The extension of our old friend, shared equity, with a new Blairite name, Home Buy Direct, and a \"free\" 30% down payment on newbuilds is merely a sop to the building lobby - indicated by it being absurdly unavailable on conversions. At \u00a3300m, it is little more than cosmetic.</p> <p>As for the \"bringing forward of old money\" for social housing - whatever that means these days - this is all but insignificant, as it will not take effect until the slump is probably over. The term \"social\" means the state giving a tiny group of lucky qualifiers what amounts to a one-off lottery win for life. It takes away attention and money from the genuinely poor and will have no general impact on the market.</p> <p>As a general rule it is patent that falling house prices are good news for the poor. Only politicians and headline writers think otherwise.</p> <p>Each fall brings home ownership within reach of more people who could never have afforded it when prices were inflated by hysteria about \"the right to home ownership\". At the height of last year's boom in house prices, the ratio of the average cost of mortgage repayment to earnings was 20%, nowhere near the 1990 level of 27%. It is now falling fast.</p> <p>The key to accessibility to the market is the availability of mortgages, and new approvals are now a savage 70% lower than last year. But this market will revive in time, provided only that the Bank of England does not wreck a recovery by raising interest rates. Again, the last thing the credit market needs is Treasury subsidies to resume lending on sub-prime properties.</p> <p>This shakeout may have been painful to those on the brink of home ownership, but even they will benefit from a market cooling in the medium term. No one but speculators and land-bankers had an interest in the bubble, and many of them now are getting their fingers well and truly burned.</p> <p>What government and the Bank should instead be worrying about is how to get credit flowing into the commercial sector, the generator of wealth and jobs. The media treats the threat of recession as signified solely by the price of houses, largely because house purchase is the nearest most journalists get to the world of serious money.</p> <p>Every economics student knows the critical factor in economic decline lies not in one sector alone but in the state of overall demand, in the cost of credit between banks and to businesses, in the level of stocks, in the cost of employing staff and in overall business confidence.</p> <p>All these are susceptible to government action of one form or another. All are damaged by careless remarks by chancellors of the exchequer and central bank governors, subsequently embroidered and misquoted by the press. They are damaged by burdens imposed on business by health, safety, building and employment law compliance, and by the lunacies of European tendering rules.</p> <p>Dismissed by ministers in time of plenty as the whinges of the business classes, these costs become a critical drag on enterprise and profit when recovery is most needed. Industrial policy is a seamless web, not something requiring attention only in time of stress.</p> <p>The OECD said yesterday that the British economy is now formally sliding into recession. The Bank of England's lone ranger, monetary policy committee member David Blanchflower - whose gloomy forecasts and pleas for lower interest rates are vindicated by each week's bad news - has warned that 2 million Britons could be unemployed by Christmas. This will cause widespread distress and constitutes a massive failure on the part of the Treasury and banking regulators and their professional acolytes, the economists - a failure that remains as yet unacknowledged and unatoned.</p> <p>This is all the more reason for others not to pile on the agony by talking down parts of the economy that do not merit it. Talking down may be second nature to politicians, but is bizarre from the man paid to do the opposite, Alistair Darling. This is a rare moment when all in positions of responsibility, including the media, owe it the nation not wilfully to make matters worse. They should start by sparing housing from analysis abuse.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:simon.jenkins@theguardian.com\">simon.jenkins@theguardian.com</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Friday September 5 2008.

  "<p>Chelsea have suffered their reality check. Roman Abramovich could have been forgiven for awaking dizzy and disorientated yesterday just hours after the Premier League's original multi-billionaire benefactor had been financially trumped for the first time since storming Stamford Bridge. His new manager's principal transfer target had been lost at the last. When the league resumes next week, Robinho will be lining up alongside Shaun Wright-Phillips for Manchester City. The visitors had anticipated confronting the one they gave away; now they must contend with the one that got away as well.</p> <p>There was a sense of deflation around the league leaders yesterday, with the anticlimax inevitably tinged with embarrassment. Rarely has this club acknowledged the anticipated arrival of a rival club's player as publicly as in the case of the Brazilian. Peter Kenyon spoke freely of his confidence Robinho would be Chelsea's during the club's pre-season tour of Asia. Even as Real Madrid's attitude to the sale oscillated so tediously, the chief executive was still suggesting the playmaker would provide \"an added dimension\" to the team as the cut-off loomed. \"We are ever confident it will get done,\" he had said last week.</p> <p>Even at the dawn of transfer deadline day, the very idea that City would soon boast the clout to compete was unthinkable. Back then, Chelsea were in a league of their own. Abramovich can throw money at anything and, had he matched Real's asking price of \u20ac40m (\u00a332.5m), they would have signed a player who had already stated his priority to be a move to Stamford Bridge. </p> <p>This pursuit also smacked of complacency. Relations between the clubs had been strained by Kenyon's public courting of a player who had two years to run on his contract at the Bernab\u00e9u. Real did not appreciate being the victims of the kind of tactics they have employed so often themselves in recent times. The oversight by an external online kit merchandiser that briefly saw Robinho replica shirts advertised on the club's official website last week was embarrassing.</p> <p>More damaging was the sight of the Chelsea chief executive leaving De Mar\u00eda restaurant, a favourite haunt of the Spanish paparazzi, with Robinho's agent Wagner Ribeiro, which enraged the Real president, Ram\u00f3n Calder\u00f3n. Thereafter, he was always inclined to do business with other suitors. City answered his call. By the time the decisive bid was lodged at around 6pm on Monday night, Chelsea - remarkably - were effectively out of the running.</p> <p>Abramovich is not used to being gazumped. His club have been happy to flex their muscles to secure players identified by Manchester United over the last five years - Arjen Robben, Michael Essien, Mikel John Obi. But, from nowhere, he suddenly has a rival with pockets deeper than his own. There was a while on Monday when it appeared United would be the first victims of the new order as City's late bid for Dimitar Berbatov threatened Sir Alex Ferguson's pursuit of the Bulgarian. Yet it was Chelsea who ended up bloodied and bruised, with Kenyon no doubt left to recall memories of how Barcelona had outmanoeuvred him to sign Ronaldinho five years ago while he was still employed at Old Trafford.</p> <p>The Chelsea chief executive and owner were apparently united in their defiant refusal to increase their offer for Robinho, and there is no suggestion that Kenyon's position is under threat despite losing out on Scolari's target. The manager is pragmatic enough and will spend the next four months considering whether additions will be required in January. Indeed, Chelsea may well choose to offer a reminder of their own clout in the midwinter window. Kaka remains within their sights. Now, though, they know that they will not be alone in attempting to wrest the forward from Milan. The days of Chelsea being unique have gone, with complacency no longer an option.</p>",
  "<p>Back in his native Doncaster for a pre-season friendly this summer, Kevin Keegan bumped into an old schoolfriend. \"We used to walk home together but I didn't recognise him at first,\" confided Newcastle United's beleaguered manager. \"People change so much.\"</p> <p>With hindsight Keegan was maybe referring to more than mere physical appearance because, over a matter of months, Newcastle's owner, Mike Ashley, had morphed from the apparent dream employer into a virtual stranger. Although Newcastle were last night insisting he had not sacked Keegan, the relationship appears all but irretrievable.</p> <p>Ashley may have continued wearing his \"King Kev\" replica tops to games but philosophical fault lines have materialised between the brash billionaire owner of Sports Direct and one of English football's more emotional managers.</p> <p>Whereas Keegan is \"old school\" in the sense that he wanted not only to be in control of transfers but to sign established, homegrown, Premier League players typically on the fringe of the England squad, Ashley's vision was radically different.</p> <p>Much taken with so-called \"continental\" management structures, Ashley believed the 57-year-old should concentrate on team affairs, leaving a football director in charge of scouting, recruitment and youth development. Moreover he did not want to pay top-dollar transfer fees and salaries, preferring to prospect for undiscovered, cheaper gems in far-flung corners of Africa and South America.</p> <p>The man Ashley entrusted with this task was Dennis Wise, Newcastle's executive director (football), and the appointment of the former Leeds manager proved a watershed. As soon as Wise and his powerful sidekick, Tony Jimenez, arrived Keegan seemed on borrowed time. Tellingly, it was not long before he was confiding to friends: \"I'm just the coach.\"</p> <p>Never afraid to \"blank\" those he perceives to have wronged him, Keegan is not, though, the world's best when it comes to buttoning his lip in front of the media. The rare occasions when the manager's words turned a little spiky revealed that Ashley possesses a surprisingly thin skin.</p> <p>For someone well used to the rough and tumble of the business world and who professes to \"hate bullshit\", Ashley came over strangely sensitive when Keegan, quite reasonably, announced that Newcastle had \"no chance\" of breaking into the top four this season, then revealed that he barely spoke to the club's owner.</p> <p>That was in May and the manager soon found himself summoned to London, Newcastle's new power base, for a telling-off. Keegan was not operating from a position of true strength and knew that crossing Ashley was hardly politic.</p> <p>Having, incredibly, admitted that he had not watched a live game since leaving Manchester City in 2005 and having earlier resigned from the England job under a tactical cloud, Keegan's suitability for a return to frontline management was questioned by many. Although he amended his image as \"yesterday's man\" by reinventing Michael Owen in a new role as a second striker, it did not go unnoticed that it took him 10 attempts to win his first game after being parachuted in as a supposedly instant insurance against relegation.</p> <p>His gratitude to Ashley for offering him a second chance was arguably amplified by the reality that Keegan's return to the limelight, and attendant healthy salary, provided his reportedly once ailing Soccer Circus theme parks business with a timely boost. </p> <p>A principled man, he found himself increasingly dodging the media in order to avoid massaging the truth and barely spoke to a reporter all summer. The warning signs were apparent in July when journalists were invited to Newcastle airport where Flybe was naming a plane in his honour. The main man was pencilled in to give a series of interviews but, to all-round embarrassment, Newcastle's manager uncharacteristically declined to say anything on the record.</p> <p>By then the problems were mounting fast. Keegan's persistent requests that the board sort out a new contract for Owen were falling on deaf ears, his decision to stand by the then imprisoned Joey Barton was trying Ashley's patience and there was still no sign of the new specialist left-back he had specifically asked Wise to find. </p> <p>Meanwhile the credit crunch had begun to bite. If, as has been suggested, Ashley originally entertained ideas of selling the club for a profit after Keegan had revived the team, such notions were swiftly dispelled by both the global economic downturn and the reality that he had hired a mortal rather than a messiah. Ironically in a union characterised by paradox and contradiction, relations appeared to deteriorate further with each exaggerated gesture the billionaire made in Keegan's honour.</p> <p>Ashley may have led a boardroom conga in homage to his acclaimed \"hero\" after Newcastle's springtime win over Sunderland but King Kev's understandable reluctance to dance to the owner's often unfathomable tune was always going to prompt a parting of the ways.</p>",
  "<p>The hills are alive with the sound of take-over offers for the Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein Organisation - the privately owned music company which has a vast back catalogue of concert classics and show tunes.</p> <p>Controlled by the descendants of composers Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein, the business is exploring strategic options including auctioning itself off, the New York Post reported yesterday.</p> <p>More than half a dozen potential suitors are believed to have expressed interest. Bids are likely to top $250m (\u00a3138.5m), although the company's advisers are looking for something closer to $325m.</p> <p>Founded more than 60 years ago, the organisation represents more than 200 writers and has a staff of 40 people. Its music publishing division also contains the work of writers including Irving Berlin and TS Eliot while its concert library licences performances of music by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Cole Porter, among many others.</p> <p>A spokesman for the organisation declined to comment yesterday. A source told the Post that the impetus to sell comes, in part, from the daughters of the company's founding composers - Mary Rodgers Guettel and Alice Hammerstein Mathias - who are behind family trusts which own the business.</p> <p>\"It's more of an estate-planning thing than anything else,\" said the source, who said it was a typical dilemma for a family business. \"Do you eventually pass control to a large number of [heirs] who may not necessarily be invested in the business?\"</p> <p>Insiders say there are opportunities for the company to license its music for television shows, commercials, games and films - activities towards which the organisation has traditionally been conservative.</p> <p>The Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein Organisation vets productions and collects royalties from anyone who wants to put on either an amateur or professional production of its shows, which include Annie Get Your Gun, Carousel, Cats, Jesus Christ Superstar, The Mikado and The Sound of Music.</p>",

(Watch it live <a href=\"http://www.rallyfortherepublic.com/\">here</a>.) Paul, as you know, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_positions_of_Ron_Paul\">opposes</a> the Iraq war, thinks America should leave the United Nations, wants the Federal Reserve to be abolished, along with most US government departments, and opposes compulsory ID cards. The Target Center may not be Invesco Field \u2014 it only has a capacity of 18,000, and it was much more than half empty an hour or so ago. But the enthusiasm of the Paul supporters made it seem fuller. They've been arriving in town over the last couple of days in groups of chartered vans, known as Ronvoys, and after the rally, they're decamping to a Minnesota dairy farm for a six-day festival, Ronstock. Tricorn hats were much in evidence, the idea being that Paul is a modern-day equivalent of the American revolutionaries who rebelled against the English. (\"No offence,\" said Tim Smith from Ohio, who was dressed in a full colonial-era outfit, when he heard my accent.) Many people think Ron Paul supporters are <a href=\"http://wonkette.com/tag/paultards\">geeky and weird</a>, but they will always have a place in my heart for having once <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/01/07/crowd-of-irate-ron-paul-f_n_80352.html\">chased the ranting right-wing talkshow host Sean Hannity out of a restaurant</a>.

  "<p>Republican presidential candidate John McCain is seeking to put his party convention back on track tonight after losing most of the first day because of Hurricane Gustav.</p> <p>President George Bush, who had been due to make the prime-time speech to the convention on Monday, is scheduled to address the delegates tonight by video link from the White House, according to the organisers.</p> <p>He was relegated to a minor role, taken off the prime-time slot with his speech cut to six minutes.</p> <p>Some of the other events planned for Monday were shifted to other slots while some were ditched altogether.</p> <p>The prime-time speakers scheduled tonight are not Bush but Fred Thompson, the Law and Order actor who ran for the Republican nomination against John McCain, and Joe Lieberman, the former Democrat and now an independent who is a close friend of McCain's.</p> <p>The minimised role given to Bush should suit McCain. While the president remains popular with a majority of Republicans, according to polls, he is unpopular in the country at large and McCain is keen to keep his distance.</p> <p>The job of both Thompson and Lieberman is to fill out McCain's biographical details, just as Michelle Obama and others did for Barack Obama last week at the start of the Democratic convention in Denver.</p> <p>McCain cancelled the first day of the convention because he judged it would be insensitive to go ahead while the Gulf Coast was struck by the hurricane and he headed to the region.</p> <p>But, with New Orleans and most of the rest of the coast having escaped the devastation wrought by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, McCain is anxious for the convention to fully resume and to secure prime-time television audiences.</p> <p>Only about a third of the delegates turned up on Monday for two hours of procedural business and a brief appearance by First Lady Laura Bush and McCain's wife, Cindy, both appealing for funds for victims of the hurricane.</p> <p>The normal bustle is expected to resume tonight, though the organisers said, in the light of the hurricane, they want to keep the tone subdued, and there would be little in the way of attacks on Obama.</p> <p>The convention organisers said they had not yet finalised the programme for Wednesday and Thursday, both of which have also had to be rewritten because of the disruption, but confirmed that McCain would deliver in person his speech accepting the nomination as presidential candidate and not by satellite, the back-up plan if Hurricane Gustav had proved catastrophic and he had remained in the region.</p> <p>The roll-call of delegates to formally nominate McCain as the party's presidential candidate is to be held Wednesday.</p> <p>With McCain and Obama virtually deadlocked in the polls and Obama having received no or only a slight poll rise from the convention, McCain is hoping he can capitalise this week and that he will get the bounce that Obama failed to.</p> <p>Almost the entire schedule today is devoted to the kind of schmaltz that appears to appeal to Americans but that European audiences would find hard to digest: hour after hour of sentimental details about McCain's life, from Cindy's adoption of a Bangladeshi child to a former Vietnam prisoner of war describing their time together in jail in Hanoi.</p> <p>Thompson is to talk about \"the courage and essence\" of John McCain while Lieberman will speak to the theme 'the original maverick', about the candidate's history of bucking the Republican line, part of the reason he is viewed with suspicion by many delegates.</p> <p>McCain is hoping that Lieberman will help him win over independents who would like to see a more bipartisan approach to politics in Washington.</p> <p>The disruption of the convention saw Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor who had also fought McCain unsuccessfully for the Republican nomination, bumped from a prime-time slot tonight to a still undetermined spot Wednesday or Thursday.</p> <p>Although the Republicans remained wary of indulging in attack politics at the convention today, they had no such scruples about ads. They released an ad today focusing on Obama's plans for tax rises. \"Take away the crowds, the chants, all that's left are costly words,\" the ad, to be broadcast in 14 battleground states, says.</p>",
  "<p>I ought to have expected to hear Serbian nationalist poetry at the third international literature festival in Novi Sad, but it is still a surprise to share a stage with a poet delivering verses with titles like Prayer for Kosovo and refrains that repeat the word Serbia, accompanied by salutes. Just to add to the experience, this happened on the day when the most prominent Serbian poet of recent times, <a href=\"http://www.theworld.org/?q=node/19816\">Radovan Karadzic</a>, refused to <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/serbia/2645213/Radovan-Karadzic-refuses-to-enter-genocide-plea.html\">enter a plea</a> at his war crime trial in The Hague.</p> <p>The guest of honour at Novi Sad was <a href=\"http://www.contemporarywriters.com/authors/?p=auth82\">Ben Okri</a>, who argued forcibly that no dictator has ever written good poetry. He added that when poets gather, they do so to speak of the highest aspirations of mankind. He may be right: I do not know Serbian well enough to judge Karadzic's poetry, and when I shared a stage with another ultra-nationalist poet, I had to judge the quality of his work by his hand gestures and the audience's response, which ranged from indifference to embarrassment. But I am not convinced that poetry is an agent of good: many prose writers have unappetising political views, such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Heidegger\">Martin Heidegger</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knut_Hamsun\">Knut Hamsun</a>, whose Nazism cannot quite erase the merits of their work.</p> <p>The problem for poetry in general and Serbian poetry in particular is that there is something poetic about nationhood. Like poetry, nationalism depends on language. And its moods are covered by poetic genres, especially the heroic and the elegiac. Taken together, the heroic and elegiac cover the entire range of Serbian nationalism: recounting the exploits of medieval nobles or mourning their defeat by the Turks at the Battle of Kosovo in the 14th century. A local poetry translator told me that her nation's heart was broken over Kosovo, and yet that throughout the ages Kosovo has awaited the Serbs' return. I was told that it was General Tito who allowed the Albanians to settle in Kosovo while forbidding Serbs from entering. When I asked why Tito would do this, I was told that it was because he was a freemason. I suggested he was better understood as a communist but was put in my place; only the little people believe in communism: wiser heads know there is an occult intelligence at work in history and it was a masonic conspiracy that led to the new heartbreak of the Serbian nation.</p> <p>These are vital elements of poetry: confabulation and imagination. But poetry also has room for analysis and, via ambiguity, multiple voices. This is why Novi Sad may be the most appropriate city for an international poetry festival in Serbia. It is a diverse city with a lively student population. I attended mass at the splendid city centre Catholic church. The enormous deconsecrated <a href=\"http://www.bh.org.il/Communities/Synagogue/NoviSad.asp\">synagogue</a> is a memorial to the Holocaust, but a living one used for classical music concerts throughout the year. These things counter the <a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/67883/Black-Hand\">black hand</a> graffiti seen across the city, as well as the numerous promises to liberate Kosovo.</p> <p>I left Novi Sad with the impression that the key attribute of Serbian nationalism is bitterness \u2013 yet that most Serbs are determined to shrug it off and look forward. This was the overwhelming message of the Novi Sad festival which was, in the best sense, an international colloquium. My only question is: are they failing to look back at themselves? Unfortunately, the international atmosphere does not encourage Serbian soul-searching.</p> <p>Serbs seem largely indifferent to the fates of Slobodan Milosevic, Karadzic or other war criminals. They are even phlegmatic about the 1999 Nato bombing of the country. They do care about Kosovo, but in a fatalistic way. Kosovo independence is regarded as a key moment in international law; in effect, the moment that such law ceased to exist. This confirms the widespread view in Serbia that national sovereignty and integrity is a joke, a view that recent events in Georgia confirm. By shrugging at these perceived injustices and turning away to forget, Serbs leave a wide space for ultra-nationalists to appropriate their national symbols \u2013 as British fascists appropriated the union flag. These are worrying issues, coming at the start of a dark era in world diplomacy. Their resolution is beyond the compass of any poet, but it may be wise for poets in Serbia \u2013 and elsewhere \u2013 to look again at what they do.</p>",
  "<p>I'm definitely, as you could tell by now, of the just-let-Sarah-Palin-collapse-under-her-own-weightlessness school. But not everyone is, and it's worth hearing the other view.</p> <p>The esteemed Ed Kilgore, with a long history in Democratic politics and first-hand knowledge of places like...the American South (!!), says maybe she <em>won't</em> just implode. He <a href=\"http://www.thedemocraticstrategist.org/strategist/2008/09/mccains_real_person.php\">says </a>at his blog that Democrats have to attack her, and not for her lack of experience, but for her outer-winguttia views on issues. Kilgore writes:</p> <blockquote> <p><br>... Democrats should focus on her nutty views and questionable associations rather than her lack of experience in characterizing this critical decision by John McCain as reckless and irresponsible. Struggling with a choice between satisfying a restless Right and reinforcing his \"maverick\" street cred, McCain found a running-mate who was a \"maverick\" from the Right. And the one thing Democrats should not let McCain get away with this week is the contention that Palin has a natural claim on support and affection from moderate swing voters, particularly women who don't believe in compulsory pregnancy. </p> </blockquote> <p>Check it out.

  "<p>Authorities on America's Gulf Coast were struggling Tuesday to orchestrate the orderly return of nearly 2 million evacuees to New Orleans and low-lying areas of Louisiana in the wake of Hurricane Gustav.</p> <p>Officials credited the exodus from New Orleans, one of the largest such evacuations in American history, with the relative low loss of life in the storm. Eight people were killed in the US as a result of hurricane.</p> <p>But with Gustav past, Louisiana's governor, Bobby Jindal, Tuesday faced an equally epic challenge of negotiating a peaceful and safe return of 95% of the population of southern Louisiana, now scattered in northern areas of the state, Texas and Tennessee.<br>The evacuees will not be allowed to go home until Wednesday at the earliest, officials said.</p> <p>With more hurricanes forming over the Atlantic -- Hanna was chewing up the Bahamas en route to Florida and South Carolina Tuesday -- the authorities were also under pressure to make sure that the public not see the relatively light toll of Gustav as an excuse to ignore future evacuation warnings.</p> <p>\"The reason that you are not seeing a dramatic series of rescues is because we had an efficient evacuation,\" Michael Chertoff, the secretary for homeland security, said. \"I wouldn't want to give the impression that a category three storm is a false alarm,\" he said at a press conference in Baton Rouge.</p> <p>Though weakened, Gustav still inflicted considerable property damage on Louisiana. Some 1.4 million homes, and even a number of hospitals, were without power Tuesday. Trees and dangling power lines were strewn across roads and the water and sewage systems in some small towns were knocked out of action by the storm.</p> <p>The damage could make it difficult or unsafe for evacuees to return to their homes, and officials Tuesday pleaded for patience. \"Re-entry is just days away, but residents shouldn't return Tuesday. Trees are down all over the city, power lines are down all over the city, and there is a significant number of homes and businesses without energy,\" said Ray Nagin, the mayor of New Orleans.<br>Nagin, who issued repeated doomsday predictions ahead of Gustav's arrival, brushed off criticism that he had exaggerated the potential for danger.</p> <p>\"I would not do a thing differently,\" the mayor told CBS television. \"I'd probably call Gustav, instead of the mother of all storms, maybe the mother-in-law or the ugly sister of all storms.\"</p> <p>More than 1,800 people were killed three years ago in the aftermath of Katrina, and the scenes of stranded flood victims in New Orleans became a symbol of the indifference and incompetence of the Bush Administration as well as the state authorities.</p> <p>But while authorities were priding themselves on their response to Gustav Tuesday, the storm still exposed the vulnerability of New Orleans, despite the billions spent shoring up the system of levees and floodwalls since 2005.</p> <p>Although the winds barely reached hurricane force, water still poured over the top of floodwalls on the western Industrial Canal -- the same canal whose collapse led to the flooding of New Orleans's Ninth Ward during Katrina.</p> <p>At a press conference Tuesday, Jindal sketched out a plan for a phased return to New Orleans and other low-lying areas starting Wednesday or Thursday, with shop owners and workers for major companies.</p> <p>The authorities were lining up hundreds of buses to pick up the evacuees and return them as close as possible to their homes.</p> <p>\"We're going to reverse the process. We had buses, trains and planes getting people out, now they're going to be bringing people back in. These are people with special needs who don't have transportation of their own,\" Nagin told reporters.</p> <p>Those evacuees with their own transport would be allowed back once each local parish gives the all clear. The many thousands who were evacuated by the authorities on bus and train would have to wait their turn. The elderly or those with chronic medical conditions would be the last to return.</p> <p>Anyone attempting to drive back into New Orleans before then would be sent back by police.</p> <p>\"They will be detained and turned around,\" a spokesman for Jindal said. \"Then they could get in a situation where they run out of fuel. We're really saying to people they need to stay where they are.</p> <p>Returning home too soon could prove dangerous because of downed power lines, standing floodwater and trees and other debris on major roadways.\"</p> <p>In Shreveport, Louisiana, there were reports overnight of fights at an overcrowded shelter.</p> <p>Doctors grew concerned about a shortage of personal medications and seven people were hospitalised, all in a stable condition.</p> <p>In Houston, evacuees have complained they were met with hostility by locals still resentful of having to absorb the refugees from Hurricane Katrina.</p> <p>Others seemed unphased by Jindal's warnings that those with medical conditions wait until all of Louisiana is up and running.</p> <p>By mid-morning, one elderly woman in Lafayette was already packing up her car to return to her home in Morgan City, with her husband, a kidney patient.</p> <p>The couple live in Morgan City, a centre for offshore drilling, that was hit badly by Gustav. Neighbours had told them their roof was damaged, and their house was without power but they were determined to return.</p> <p>\"Tomorrow is my husband's last day before he needs his dialysis again. We have to find some place where we can have it, so we are just going to go home and see,\" she said.</p> <p>Other areas on Gustav's path began to return to normal Tuesday. A few petrol stations opened as well as supermarkets, which were immediately besieged by people buying sacks of ice and charcoal.</p>",
  "<p>Newcastle United have tonight denied reports that Kevin Keegan has been sacked as manager. It was believed that Keegan and the club had parted company earlier today after he failed to turn up to training following a heated row with the board.</p> <p>\"The club wants to keep progressing with its long-term strategy and would like to stress that Kevin is extremely important, both now and in the future,\" a club statement read this evening. \"Newcastle United values the effort and commitment shown by Kevin since his return to St James' Park and wants him to continue to play an instrumental role as manager of the club. For the avoidance of doubt the club has not sacked Kevin Keegan as manager.\"</p> <p>While the statement will placate the hundreds of fans who this afternoon turned up at the stadium to protest against his perceived dismissal, Keegan's future at the club will remain in doubt until he confirms his intention to stay. </p> <p>He was summoned to meetings with club officials including Mike Ashley, the owner, and Derek Llambias, the managing director, yesterday and today and effectively told he needed to pull his socks up in the wake of the team's 3-0 defeat at Arsenal. This in turn prompted a furious row in which Keegan, once again, expressed his frustration at Dennis Wise's control of the recruitment policy.</p> <p>Newcastle's executive director, Wise is in charge of transfers but failed to deliver Keegan the specialist left-back he had been demanding all summer, let alone the \"four top quality\" signings he had hoped would arrive by midnight on Monday. Newcastle's only transfer activity on deadline day was the signing of Spanish striker Xisco and the loan signing of midfielder Ignacio Gonzalez.</p> <p>Moreover Keegan, who returned to manage the club for a second time in January, was uneasy at both the decision to sell James Milner to Aston Villa, just days after he had claimed the England Under-21 winger would be going nowhere, and the club's delay over negotiating a new contract with Michael Owen.</p>",
  "<p>The lingering image is of Graeme Hick returning to the pavilion at that tea-time declaration. He has just completed his 405 not out, almost prosaically paced over 555 minutes. He should be drained, with traces of elation etching through his weariness. Instead, he walks with a brisk step; the face offers not a flicker of emotion as the smallish crowd, belatedly sensing the proximity of cricket history, converges to applaud. He passes not more than a yard away - and there is not the merest evidence of perspiration on his cheeks and forehead. He could be out for a walk along Worcestershire's Severn.</p> <p>Hick has never been much for showing his feelings. He is a dutifully courteous and laconic man. You search in vain for a technical insight from his lips or physical nuance. To him the game is not predominantly cerebral or calling for self-analysis. He accepts that nature has blessed him with a wondrous eye-sight, able to pick up the flight, line and pace quicker than most other cricketing mortals. But you fancy that at times such gifts embarrass him.</p> <p>He has been playing here for a quarter of a century and we suspect that the eyes are starting to let him down; so are the much envied balance and reflexes. Yet it is time for him to choose to go.</p> <p>Those of us privileged to watch him in his best years have marvelled at the risible ease with which he has played the game. At country level, he has made so many contemporaries look ordinary. His bat was broader than anyone else's. Nothing seemed to get past it. There was always a respect for orthodoxy; with an hypnotic efficiency he took on the bowlers in rotation. The strokes were always clean. For a big man, he was imposing rather than handsome in execution. </p> <p>We don't truly know why he was a relative failure on the broader international stage. If he ever worked out the temperamental quirks that disrupted his composure and too often undervalued his statistical grandeur and instinctive mastery, he wasn't saying. </p> <p>One returns to that mighty and, dare one say it, mundane innings at Taunton. It rightly took over the match. Yet it was hard to remember specific strokes or technical peaks. In its special brand of brilliance, it was strangely soulless. He was mocking the game in making it look too easy. Perhaps the West Country spectators, slow to respond as the innings was built, had been spoilt by the ferocity and flamboyance of Viv Richards' bat on this same arena not so long before. </p> <p>Eventually word got round that Wisden and its records were in business. The crowd became blissfully impartial, unmindful of disintegrating figures among the Somerset bowlers. We shall never know what possessed Phil Neale to declare the Worcestershire innings when Hick was so near to Archie MacLaren's all-time highest individual innings at that point. We can only assume that he was not aware how near Hick himself was or concerned about the accolade of which he had been robbed. </p> <p>Hick was still only 21, needing to wait another three years before being eligible to play for England. The cricketing politics did not bother him a great deal. Later that evening we asked him about his feat. Politely, quietly, he said he felt a bit tired. And well, that was it. He was not made for profuse prose.</p> <p>Over the years he has not changed much. He stands tall and erect in the slips, as he does at the crease. He is one of the more introverted occupants of the dressing room. He still makes it all look, if rather less frequently now in his case, absurdly easy. International opponents said they had found him out, capitalising on his frailties at the very top level. He came from a very different Zimbabwe and it is possible his particular background worked against him.</p> <p>The day after his 405, at the close of play, I saw him lugging with some difficulty his heavy cricket bag down the pavilion steps. He signed an autograph and struggled off to his car, looking endearingly ordinary and unassuming. </p> <p>Hick has served Worcestershire abundantly. He is one of the great enigmas of modern cricket in this country - and maybe we shall never quite understand why he fell short.</p>",
  "<p>Check out <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2008/10/wolff200810?currentPage=2\">this new one</a> from Michael Wolff of Vanity Fair. He describes, for the first time, a meeting among Rupert Murdoch, Roger Ailes and Barack Obama that took place over the summer. Fascinating stuff.</p> <p>The meeting had been sought for some time. Now, in reading that sentence, you assumed that I meant Obama sought the meeting. But it was the other way around! Now <em>that </em>takes a set, no? Read on:</p> <blockquote> <p>Obama, on the other hand, was snubbing Murdoch. Every time he reached out (Murdoch executives tried to get the Kennedys to help smooth the way to an introduction), nothing. The Fox stain was on Murdoch.</p> </blockquote> <p>Eventually, it happened. Rupert and Barack sat \"knee to knee.\" Obama started asking Murdoch about his relationship with his father. In due course Ailes took Rupe's place, and Obama basically said to him, I'm not gonna waste my time talking to you as long as your network is just gonna slap me and my wife around. Wolff reports that \"a tentative truce was agreed upon.\"</p> <p>So. I've been an amateur Murdochologist for two decades now, and my cursory reading of the New York Post this year, which I pick up about two times a week or so \u2013 the paper does have some very good reporters, and it features <a href=\"http://www.nypost.com/gossip/cindy/cindy.htm\">the hardest-working newspaper columnist in America bar none</a> \u2013 has long indicated to me that the Post is covering Obama pretty fairly and quite clearly leaving open the option of endorsing Obama.</p> <p>Fox is Fox. It has a constituency of hard-core Republicans and it has to service that constituency. Besides, it is mostly run and staffed by hard-core Republicans. So it will be McCain's amen corner, whatever its reservations about him. As for The Wall Street Journal, its editorial page is run by conservatives who are also very committed to Republican power. Rupert's the boss and can do what he wants, but I suspect the businessman in him would understand that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2005/apr/20/election2005.uk4\">pulling a Blair</a> with so revered a sheet as the Journal might create credibility issues.</p> <p>The Post, however, is an instrument of his will; it really has no identity outside Murdoch. He can do what he wants with it. And he just may decide that Obama is Blair-like, or Blair-like enough \u2013 and, of course, that Obama would sell more papers for four years than McCain, which is undoubtedly the case. </p> <p>The circumstances in early November would have to be exactly right: it will need to look as if Obama is going to win anyway, and on the statesman vs. Muslim-terrorist scale, Obama will need to be tilting strongly toward the former. But I've always said it's possible that the Post will back Obama. Wolff's report backs me up on this. His wife, Wendi, \"has been attending fund-raisers for Obama in Los Angeles with David Geffen.\" Wives tend to have influence in these situations.</p>",
  "<p>A <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2005/dec/03/travelnews.internationalnews\">ski resort</a> in the Gulf, the brain can deal with. An enormous <a href=\"http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2004442380_yemen28.html\">bridge across the Red Sea to Africa</a>, fine. But when oil-rich sheikhs turn to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/sep/02/manchestercity.premierleague\">making Manchester City a top four club</a>, it's a bit too much interference with the natural order. Concerned voices this morning asked if this was the end of football. It's not. It's the end of meaning. All reference points are scrambled.</p> <p>Was it really just a happy fortnight ago when the stalls outside Old Trafford were mocking their local rivals with Thaksin Shinawatra appeal T-shirts? Today, United fans have to deal with a very different beast, as City switch foreign proprietors again. In a mind-altering moment those faltering, comical mishaps in blue had turned into the world's richest club, and were flexing those financial muscles with all the glee of a gurning Tom Hanks suddenly turned <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZRPM1Fn-Aw\">Big</a>. </p> <p>In honesty, City will be doing, more or less, what United have long been accused of doing: buying success. In United's 1960s glory years, the club was owned by a shady local pork butcher, and splashed out record six-figure fees for players. Only the scale has changed. United fans can keep the relative moral high ground employed when Roman Abramovich skewed the playing field at Chelsea, pointing to a wealth largely generated by fans and the fact that the club's own \u2013 unwelcomed \u2013 American owner has landed it with more debt than funds.</p> <p>And for a while, even to United fans, it will feel more of a comedy sideshow to see the likes of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/sep/02/manchestercity.chelsea1\">Robinho</a> playing for City, a chance to enjoy the spectacle of Abramovich outspent and Liverpool fans begging to be rescued by their own Arabian suitors in Dubai. The truth is City hasn't generated the same antipathy from United fans as Chelsea, Arsenal and \u2013 especially \u2013 Liverpool for some time. Partly this is down to a shared heritage closer than fans might want to admit \u2013 Sir Matt Busby, Denis Law, ground-sharing after the war, solidarity after Munich, Mark Hughes \u2013 but mainly because City haven't been serious rivals since the mid-1970s. That's why scouse-baiting \"Capital of Trophies 08\" T-shirts were doing brisker trade than those mocking City. Fans \u2013 on both sides of Manchester \u2013 nurture the innate belief that City is perennially doomed to failure.</p> <p>But a few billion pounds could change all that. The cheeky bid to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/sep/01/manchestercity.tottenhamhotspur\">grab Berbatov</a> before United hints that the rivalry will become serious. </p> <p>All we United fans can hope for is that our nouveau riche neighbours find, like so many lottery winners, that their sudden windfall doesn't buy them happiness; or indeed, like Hanks, that they've now got the physical tools they're emotionally unequipped to deal with. After years of revelling in their status as lovable losers, City fans will feel the resentment of all those who see these undeserving carpetbaggers snapping up all the best players. City stars will quickly earn the \"rent boys\" tag now aimed derisively at <a href=\"http://www.epltalk.com/manchester-city-is-the-new-chelsea-of-premier-league/3079\">Chelsea</a>. </p> <p>It's all wrong, but City should enjoy it while it lasts. Fans who are long past thinking it can all be won on the pitch will be dreaming today. And one day their sheikh, too, will come.</p>",
  "<p>I wish I could say that most of the content in last night's <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/dispatches/undercover+mosque+the+\">Dispatches</a> programme was either exaggerated or presented the views of an isolated minority, but it was all too familiar. </p> <p>In the programme, a female reporter, working under cover, attended prayer meetings at a British mosque which claims to be dedicated to moderation - and secretly filmed sermons given to the women-only congregation in which female preachers expressed extremist and intolerant beliefs.</p> <p>The self-taught, self-appointed housewives took it upon themselves to preach not only a narrow bigoted strain of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wahhabi\">Wahhabi</a> Islam, but did so through their own very limited skills in <em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tafsir\">tafsir</a></em> and extrapolation.</p> <p>The defence given by the <a href=\"http://www.iccuk.org/\">London Central Mosque</a> in Regent's Park was that it is not easy to regulate or oversee such sessions, especially in female sections of the mosques where male mosque officials male do not venture. </p> <p>I have lived in Saudi Arabia where the Wahhabi version of Islam dominates. In almost every neighbourhood of the kingdom there is one or more of these women who opens up her house for others at whom to preach. She takes young brides under her wing, dispenses marital advice, brews coffee and hands out fatwas with damning certainty. For most of the women who attend them, these <em>halaqas</em> (teaching cricles) provide a rare opportunity to get out of the house and have some kind of social life. The religious purpose legitimises their excursion away from home, and so conservative mothers and husbands give it their approval.</p> <p>At <em>halaqas</em>, collections for charity, Quran teaching sessions, random lectures on everything from the plight of the Palestinians to the <a href=\"http://www.islamonline.com/news/newsfull.php?newid=18581\">sins of eyebrow-plucking</a> are held under the benevolent supervision of such women and the participants often try to outdo each other, competing to display pride in the depth of their submission to husbands and parents.</p> <p>While this serves to radicalise vulnerable young women (my little sister, a regular attendee of such sessions once became almost hysterical when I plucked my eyebrows), it is usually in their personal lives and the running of their households that the effects of this teaching become most apparent. </p> <p>When these views are promoted in Britain they instil a hatred for the other, the non-Muslim, even the more liberal Muslim, and prey on the disfranchised and the marginalised, empowering them with the right to hate and a divine justification for doing so. </p> <p>A lethal combination of official Saudi funds and sponsorship and unofficial receptacles of Wahhabism has propelled this dynamic outside Saudi Arabia. This strain of Islam is not only creating tension in the UK, but in parts of the Arab world where expatriate workers return from Saudi Arabia imbued with an alien mutant form of Islam that is totally at odds with the Islam their parents practised \u2013 one that had evolved over centuries and reached a natural cadence and symbiosis with the local culture. </p> <p>In addition, as the programme pointed out, charities financed by the Saudi Ministry of Islamic Affairs are established in the poorer regions of Africa and the Arab World with resident sheikhs and literature promoting Wahhabism. As the Custodian of the two Holy Mosques, the Saudi junta has taken it upon itself to teach the Islamic world what \"correct\" observance of the religion is all about and it is heartbreaking to see those who look to Saudi Arabia and Mecca as the imparter of knowledge receive a twisted, bigoted version which teaches that in order to be a good Muslim you must not only love but hate. </p> <p>Translated Qurans adulterated by footnotes reinterpreting all the verses that do not fit in with the Wahhabi world view are handed out by the Saudi religious authorities - which not only betrays and appropriates God's word but, more alarmingly, displays an arrogant assumption of superiority. Tragically, this obfuscates the Quran's message.</p> <p>The informal sessions of the women at Regent's Park Mosque and the mosque that denies knowledge of their existence are a microcosm of the dynamic between the political and religious domains in Saudi Arabia. While the Saudi government denies the existence of an extreme religious establishment, this organisation is very real and is allowed to control the public and social spheres of everyday life in kingdom, financed by the government in return for amnesty and immunity from Wahhabism itself. </p> <p>Sharia law is not practised in Saudi Arabia the way Wahhabis would like it to be and the Saudi royal family has close ties with \"infidel\" governments. The Saudi regime is aware of the opposition to its own decadence and, to placate piqued religious feeling, it gives the religious establishment even more freedom to impose itself on the public sphere with impunity.</p> <p>This religious set of values goes beyond faith, reinforced by the messages of exclusion, separatism and hatred for the other. When it is exported to the UK under the auspices of charities and mosques and embedded in the minds of those lacking a valid identity, it ceases to be merely an incompatible version of Islam but one that, due to the way it has been sponsored and permitted to develop and grow unchecked, irreparably damages the hopes for integration.</p> <p>The British government and authorities need to acknowledge this danger and not be afraid of rupturing their precious entente with the Saudi royal family.</p>",

  "<p>The British Film Institute is launching one of those polls to discover not the nation's favourite film, but the film most worthy of being passed down through future generations. Since it is in aid of their 75th birthday, they have asked 75 figures from film to nominate a movie (I've popped some highlights down below but the full list can be read <a href=\"http://www.bfi.org.uk/75/\">here</a>). You can vote on what has already been suggested by following that link - or else nominate your own idea, giving reasons why. The most popular will be shown at the BFI and cinemas around the country. The contention is, according to BFI director Amanda Nevill, that films are as important a part of our culture heritage as, say, the Titians in the National Gallery of Scotland or Greek vases in the British Museum. </p> <p>In other words, they are not \"just trite entertainment\" but part of a shared cultural history and identity (shades here of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2005/oct/22/heritage\">Neil MacGregor</a>-style discourse about culture and \"Britishness\").</p> <p>It's an extremely open-ended question of course: would one pass down a film that one loved; or one that spoke profoundly about the human condition; or would you try to revive a lost gem? I usually react fairly wearily about this kind of listmania, but it is still good fun - and, needless to say, a good way of gleaning recommendations for DVD nights. The single most popular film on the list so far, with three nominations, is Powell and Pressburger's A Matter of Life and Death; and David Lean is showing up strongly too. All in all, there's a surprising number of British films represented - and, as you'd expect with this kind of list, few very recent films.</p> <p>I've a nasty feeling that I would go for Powell and Pressburger too. <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0038733/\">A Matter of Life and Death</a> has it all: magic, surrealism, visual fireworks, romance of the highest order, and coming from a background of war that seems, alas, more urgent than ever. But maybe I'd go for <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0036695/\">A Canterbury Tale</a> instead for its fairytale strangeness, its moving shots of a war-blasted Canterbury, its pastoralism, its ideas about transformation, and for that marvellous organ-recital finale.</p> <p>Here are some nominations by notable film-types:</p> <p>Juliette Binoche: The Sacrifice (1986) Dir Andrei Tarkovksy Miranda Richardson: The Innocents (1961) Dir Jack Clayton Terence Davies: Kind Hears and Coronets (1949) Dir Robert Hamer Michael Nyman: Silent Light (2007) Dir Carlos Reygadas Cate Blanchett: Stalker (1979) Dir Andrei Tarkovsky Simon Pegg: Raising Arizona (1987) Dir Joel Coen Bill Nighy: Mississippi Burning (1988) Dir Alan Parker Nathalie Press: The Wizard of Oz (1939) Dir Victor Fleming Roger Moore: Lawrence of Arabia (1962) Dir David Lean Ben Kingsley: Never Take No For An Answer (1951) Dir Maurice Cloche Ken Loach: Closely Observed Trains (1966) Dir Jiri Menzel Paul Greengrass: The Battle of Algiers (1966) Dir Gillo Pontecorvo Margaret Hodge: A Matter of Life and Death (1946) Dir Michael Powell, Emeric Pressburger Ken Russell: Metropolis (1927) Dir Fritz Lang Stephen Frears: The Third Man (1949) Dir Carol Reed Chiwetel Ejiofor: Dr Strangelove (1964) Dir Stanley Kubrick Lord Puttnam: Local Hero (1983) Dir Bill Forsyth</p>",

Three \u2013 James McGrath, Ray Lewis and Tim Parker \u2013 have been dropped from the team before every position has even been filled, and headhunters <a href=\"http://davehill.typepad.com/london3ms/2008/08/a-spokesperson.html\">have been employed to complete the task</a>. </p> <p>Green activists have been especially narked due to the mayor's failure to appoint an environment adviser, suspecting this confirmed \u2013 in the words of Green party mayoral candidate Si\u00e2n Berry \u2013 that he hasn't a green bone in his body.<br> But Johnson has moved to counter this since returning to London following his \"ping-pong\" speech in Beijing. Yesterday he launched <a href=\"http://www.london.gov.uk/view_press_release.jsp?releaseid=18576\">London's Climate Change Adaptation Strategy</a> document, which his office says underlines his manifesto commitment to make London a leading \"green\" city (though sceptics point out that the report was commissioned by his predecessor). </p> <p>And today, he has at last filled that green gap in his staff, not with a risky outsider or approved Central Office wonk, but with someone from his own backyard. Isabel Dedring has worked as director of Transport for London's policy unit for the past four years and before that as its chief of staff. </p> <p>She has \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.london.gov.uk/view_press_release.jsp?releaseid=18637\">it says here</a> \u2013 a law degree from Harvard and is fluent in Russian, German and French. </p> <p>According to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/bpcarbonneutral/story/0,,1929505,00.html\">the Guardian</a> she is \"smart, tough, lean and American.\"<br> A number of obvious questions arise. Are City Hall's two Green assembly members satisfied? Well, <a href=\"http://davehill.typepad.com/london3ms/2008/09/isabel-dedrin-1.html\">Jenny Jones AM is pleased</a> that the mayor has \"at last\" appointed someone, \"and a woman at that\". </p> <p>Darren Johnson AM <a href=\"http://davehill.typepad.com/london3ms/2008/09/isabel-dedrin-2.html\">shares her relief</a>. </p> <p>Well, I gather that she wrote Ken Livingstone's climate change action plan and impressed as a driving force behind the former mayor's plans for \"greening\" transport, including hybrid buses. Her contribution to <a href=\"http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm200506/cmselect/cmenvaud/981/6041906.htm\">this 2006 select committee hearing</a> confirms that we're not dealing with a beginner.</p> <p>Then there are the politics of the appointment. Unlike those who've been evicted from City Hall's Big Brother house, she has the look of a safe choice: a capable insider with experience and knowledge of the capital's corridors of power. </p> <p>As <a href=\"http://www.boriswatch.co.uk/2008/09/02/boris-reaches-the-speed-of-reality/] \">Boris Watch points out</a>, the gleeful predictions of Ken-haters that the new mayor would cleanse TfL of all traces the old regime are looking a bit premature.

  "<p>Manchester City's new billionaire owners are planning a world-record \u00a3135m bid for Cristiano Ronaldo in the January transfer window before turning their sights to, among others, Fernando Torres of Liverpool and Cesc F\u00e1bregas of Arsenal. \"Ronaldo has said he wants to play for the biggest club in the world, so we will see in January if he is serious,\" said Dr Sulaiman Al-Fahim, of the Abu Dhabi United Group.</p> <p>Al-Fahim also re-iterated that he would investigate the potential availability of the former Arsenal striker Thierry Henry, Valencia's David Villa and the former Brazil international Ronaldo to join Robinho in a \"dream team\" that would be able to challenge for the Champions League within two or three years.</p> <p>However, he identified United's Ronaldo as the biggest challenge for the billionaire tycoons, backed by members of the United Arab Emirates royal family, who have taken control of the club from Thaksin Shinawatra. \"Real Madrid were estimating his value at $160m (\u00a390m) but for a player like that, to actually get him, will cost a lot more; I would think $240m (\u00a3135m). But why not? We are going to be the biggest club in the world, bigger than both Real Madrid and Manchester United.\"</p> <p>In all probability, City's chances of persuading Ronaldo to forget about moving to Real Madrid and decide instead to swap Old Trafford for Eastlands - or 'Middle Eastlands', as some City fans have started referring to it - are, at best, miniscule. Yet City's remarkable signing of Robinho from Real Madrid, for a British record \u00a332.5m, just before Sunday's transfer deadline has already sent shockwaves through the sport, and Al-Fahim insisted the club would be willing to pay United three times the world transfer record, set in 2001 when Zinedine Zidane moved from Juventus to Real Madrid. \"We want a team who can win the Champions League,\" he added.</p> <p>Al-Fahim also confirmed that Torres and F\u00e1bregas were among his targets as City look to bring in a \"minimum 18\" players. \"We're not just going to spend money on anyone, but if we can get the biggest players in the world, and of course if the manager wants them, then we will get them,\" he said.</p> <p>Robinho arrived in London on Tuesday for a brief meeting with Mark Hughes to conclude the transfer - even though he has yet to take the usually routine medical examination - before flying out to join up with the Brazil national squad for Monday's World Cup qualifier against Chile. The 24-year-old has agreed a four-year contract that makes him the highest-paid footballer in the history of the game, with a weekly salary of \u00a3160,000.</p> <p>Ronaldo could conceivably be offered twice that amount but it could also be argued that City's pursuit of the twice footballer-of-the-year also demonstrates a degree of naivety on the part of the new owners. United's reaction was one of bemusement, a spokesman saying \"we have made it clear all summer that Cristiano is not for sale\".</p>",
  "<p><br>David Harrower's 365 ... The play is full of stories but they are presented in a fractured way</p> <p>From the fairytales we hear as children to stories we read in the papers, we have an insatiable appetite to find out what happens next. That's why when a play is unsatisfying, it is so often because it has a weakness in the narrative.</p> <p>It is our interest in the story that drives our understanding of character and theme. When the plot fails us, we need extra reserves of patience not to become indifferent about the characters and disengaged with the playwright's big ideas.</p> <p>Narrative has a bad reputation in the theatre because of the spectre of the well-made play: when a story is too neat and tidy, we're told, it draws our attention to its own artifice. But to go to the opposite extreme and claim, as frequently people do, that art should be chaotic because life is chaotic seems to me to miss the point. We engage in art to make sense of the chaos, not merely to see it replicated.</p> <p>This does not mean narrative has to be handled in a conventional manner. To suggest there is something implicitly old-fashioned about narrative is a mistake. Stories can be told in as many ways as the imagination allows.</p> <p>That's why I take issue with my friend <a href=\"http://www.edinburgh-festivals.com/reviews/Plenty-of-shock-not-enough.4439035.jp\">Joyce McMillan</a> when she suggests that negative reactions to David Harrower's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/aug/23/edinburghfestival.festivals4\">365</a>, which is following its Edinburgh festival run with dates at the <a href=\"http://www.lyric.co.uk/pl352.html\">Lyric Hammersmith</a>, are because of \"theatrical tastes and assumptions [that] remain fairly conservative\".</p> <p>Her remarks were inspired by an interview in the <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2008/08/08/bt365108.xml\">Daily Telegraph</a> in which Harrower explained the thinking behind 365, a play about young people leaving care to take on an independent adult life. \"The abiding metaphor for the play is the fact of having no narrative,\" he said, explaining that children in care don't have control of their own stories. It is our personal stories, the play suggests, that give us our sense of identity and if those stories are lost in a morass of foster parents and care homes, a teenager can find his very personality unresolved.</p> <p>This is a powerful idea - one that strengthens, not weakens, the thesis that narrative is important to us - and one that makes particular sense from the author of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2005/aug/17/theatre.edinburghfestival2005\">Blackbird</a>. That play, about a confrontation between an older man and a younger woman 15 years after their illegal sexual relationship, is about two people desperate to piece together the fractured narrative of their lives. Theirs was a story interrupted by the man's arrest, leaving them in need of resolution. Trying to reach that resolution is one of the things the play is about.</p> <p>As far as 365 goes, however, I'm with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/aug/31/theatre.edinburghfestival\">Susannah Clapp</a> when she quotes Harrower saying \"clarity doesn't feel right\" and counters it with her own opinion that \"muddle doesn't feel much better\".</p> <p>Far from rejecting narrative, 365 is actually full of stories, many you'd like to follow in greater depth. But by presenting the fractured stories in a fractured way, the production forfeits our emotional engagement. Ironically, that means it expresses the idea of a fractured story less well than the conventionally structured Blackbird.</p> <p>For this reason, it strikes me that a supposedly conservative conventional narrative is more capable of politicising an audience than its formally radical alternative. I'm bolstered in this opinion by 365, which has its <a href=\"http://www.edinburgh-festivals.com/reviews/Theatre-Review-365.4422326.jp\">admirers</a> and its <a href=\"http://www.onstagescotland.co.uk/365.htm\">detractors</a>, but which comes across to me as strangely apolitical. The care system is a subject about which everyone from director Vicky Featherstone down feels deeply concerned yet, as Michael Billington wrote, the play \"offers no viable alternative to the surely reasonable practice of permitting institutionalised kids a measure of freedom\".</p> <p>As far as I can see, it doesn't even suggest there is much of a problem in the first place, something that wouldn't have happened with an old-fashioned story to dramatise the dilemma.</p>",
  "<p>You may not know the name, but you'll have heard the voice hundreds, if not thousands of times. Don LaFontaine, king of the movie voiceover, has died at the age of 68.</p> <p>LaFontaine, who was known for habitually using the words \"in a world\" to preface his work on trailers, died at Cedar-Sinai medical center in Los Angeles of complications from a collapsed lung on Monday, <a href=\"http://www.etonline.com/news/2008/09/64990/index.html\">according to ETonline</a>. However that cause of death was not official at the time of this report.</p> <p>LaFontaine's powerful tones appeared on more than 5,000 movie trailers and nearly 350,000 commercials. <a href=\"http://www.donlafontaine.com\">His website</a> lists voiceovers for Terminator II: Judgement Day, Shrek, Minority Report and Dodgeball among his most famous work, and he had also worked as the in-house announcer at the Oscars and the Screen Actors Guild awards. He was credited as being the busiest ever member of the latter, based on the number of contracts signed in his working life.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJMGS7l0wT8\">LaFontaine had recently parodied himself</a> on a series of US TV commercials for Geico. He was referred to as \"that announcer guy from the movies\" and stood in the background translating in LaFontaine-speak while a customer revealed her wonderful experience at the hands of the insurance company. </p> <p>LaFontaine, who was born in Duluth, Minnesota, began his career as a recording engineer, but got his big break when he filled in for an absentee voice artist on the 1964 western Gunfighters of Casa Grande.</p> <p>At his peak, he is said to have recorded more than 60 voiceovers in a week, and sometimes as many 35 in a single day. So busy was he that he employed a full-time chauffeur to ferry him from gig to gig. This, he said, saved him time as he didn't have to worry about parking in between jobs.</p> <p>In latter years, with the advent of ISDN, LaFontaine recorded almost exclusively from a home studio at his estate in the Hollywood hills.</p> <p>He is survived by his wife, the singer/actor Nita Whitaker and three children, Christine, Skye and Elyse.</p>",

  "<p>The Republican party is seeking to resume normal service at its convention with high-profile speakers lined up to praise John McCain in his presidential election contest with Barack Obama.</p> <p>Republicans say Fred Thompson, one of the failed presidential hopefuls, and Joe Lieberman, the Democrat turned independent, will speak tonight about McCain's biography and their friendship with him. </p> <p>Aides said McCain would probably deliver his nomination acceptance speech in person tomorrow.</p> <p>White House officials held out the possibility that George Bush would make a televised address to the convention from Washington, although the McCain campaign has tried to distance itself from the highly unpopular president. </p> <p>Bush and Dick Cheney, the vice-president, cancelled their appearances yesterday, even before convention organisers decided to scale back ceremonies because of Hurricane Gustav.</p> <p>As Gustav forced a scaledown of the normal convention hoopla, McCain's vice-presidential running mate, Sarah Palin, the Alaska governor, appears to have energised the Republican base.</p> <p>McCain's surprise choice of a political unknown has injected fresh energy into the McCain campaign, leading to larger crowds at his rallies. Since he made the announcement last Friday, his campaign has raised $10m (\u00a35m), contributing to an August tally of $47m.</p> <p>But Palin's family life has proved to be a distraction.

James Dobson, founder of Focus on the Family, commended the Palins \"for not just talking about their pro-life and pro-family values, but living them out even in the midst of trying circumstances\".</p> <p>Details of Palin's family life raised questions about the McCain campaign's vetting process. The man who led McCain's vice-presidential search team said he thought everything that had come up as a possible red flag during the background check had now been made public.</p> <p>\"I think so,\" Arthur Culvahouse told the Associated Press. \"Yes.

  "<p>In one way, the news that Jeffrey John, the dean of St Albans, <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article4656617.ece\">may be considered</a> to become bishop of the vacant diocese of Bangor in Wales should come as no surprise, as he is eminently well-qualified: a leading and incisive theologian, an inspirational preacher, well-liked and respected by parishioners in Southwark and at his current cathedral, and a Welshman who actually speaks Welsh. What's not to like? Well, of course, one thing: that he is gay \u2013 though celibate \u2013 and in a civil partnership with his companion of many years standing, who is also an ordained Anglican clergyman.</p> <p>When five years ago, John was proposed as bishop of Reading, his appointment was endorsed \u2013 twice \u2013 by his old friend Rowan Williams, the Archbishop of Canterbury, announced by Downing Street and confirmed by the Queen, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/jun/18/gayrights.bookextracts\">only to be challenged</a> so vociferously by a coordinated international campaign of conservatives and evangelicals that Williams got cold feet and forced John unwillingly to stand down.</p> <p>John's sin, of course, was honesty: he was discreet about his homosexuality and had certainly not flaunted it, but had argued, quietly and academically, for a more Christian understanding of gays. Evangelicals who assiduously sought evidence of promiscuity and sinfulness could not find it, even though they trawled the electoral register to see if he was living with his partner.</p> <p>So they demanded repentance instead. But he would not ostentatiously renounce of his orientation, apologise for his views, or spurn his long-term partnership as they demanded. Of course, even had he done so, they would not have been satisfied: a motley collection of bishops said that if John asserted he was celibate, they would rejoice; but when he did so, it made no difference to them (nor did they disown or condemn those African archbishops who claimed homosexuals were the devil's work and worse than beasts). A vicar at whose vicarage bishops of Reading customarily parked their cars told John he would not be welcome to do so (\"After all,\" his wife told me, \"That's not the sort of person one wants to meet in one's drive in the morning, is it? It was nothing personal ...\"). Welcome to the Church of England in the first decade of the 21st century.</p> <p>If only John had kept quiet, if there had been no evidence in his writings to hold against him, he would have been a bishop already then. After all, at least two current bishops in the Church of England are widely understood to be gay, and there are almost certainly more. </p> <p>But if Anglicanism breathed a sigh of relief at a crisis averted in June 2003, within a month it <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/02/anglicanism.religion1\">sparked afresh</a> with the election of Gene Robinson in New Hampshire, a non-celibate, divorced cleric who made no secret of his orientation but was elected bishop by his parishioners anyway, and who has declined ever since to bow to pressure to stand down. His position is bolstered by the fact that the US Episcopal Church elects its bishops and does not just appoint them via the prime minister and the Queen as the established Church of England does.</p> <p>Within the diocese of Oxford, where John would have been a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffragan\">suffragan</a> bishop, the evangelical protests which created so much pressure on Archbishop Williams, were met with incredulity within the wider community: support for him had run at two to one and he had received the backing of such radical subversives as all the local Tory MPs and the Lord Lieutenant of Berkshire, among many others. The evangelicals were bemused that their opposition did not receive wider support, even in the media, despite the fact that it was enough to force the archbishop and his advisers to run for cover. In due course, Jeffrey John was offered the consolation prize of dean of St Albans, an appointment that was met with scarcely a murmur of dissent, apart from one elderly man with a placard outside his packed induction service at St Albans cathedral in 2004. </p> <p>There is no doubt that John would like a bishopric and is qualified for one, but the source of the latest rumour is intriguing. It comes from the Rev David Anderson, one of the American conservatives who led the protests against the election of Gene Robinson and who was assiduous in <a href=\"http://www.thewitness.org/agw/flad080703.html\">spreading lies</a> about him. (Did he subsequently apologise for bearing false witness about Robinson \u2013 what do you think?) You might ask what the appointment of the bishop of Bangor has to do with someone living in Atlanta, Georgia, especially given the church's supposed agreement not to trespass on events in other provinces, but of course, Anderson is part of an international coalition ever vigilant against gay clergy. One of Anderson's close associates is Canon Chris Sugden of Oxford, one of the campaigners against John in 2003 and now an organiser of the conservative coalition known as Gafcon whose member bishops <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/19/religion.anglicanism\">boycotted</a> Archbishop Williams's recent Lambeth conference. And, funnily enough, Sugden's daughter, Joanna, is employed as deputy to the Times' religion correspondent who broke the story. Of course, this may all be a coincidence.</p> <p>Archbishop Barry Morgan of Wales \u2013 Rowan Williams' successor in the principality \u2013 is on record as saying he would have no objection in principle to consecrating a gay bishop. The Church in Wales is not established (it took the Westminster parliament 80 years to pass legislation to disestablish it before doing so in the 1920s, proponents of disestablishment of the Church of England please note), and will take a vote in secret conclave as to who the next bishop of Bangor will be next month. It will need a two-thirds majority and will face concerted pressure, not least from Rowan Williams, not to be provocative and to make a safer, quieter choice. </p> <p>It looks as though Anderson's intervention is a first, not so subtle attempt to juice up evangelicals once more to oppose John. The dean of St Albans says you shouldn't judge God by His church, but sometimes it's hard not to.</p>",
  "<p><strong>The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Wednesday September 10 2008</strong></p> <p> In the article below it was stated that Sarah Palin was a member of the Alaskan Independence party. The Alaskan Independence party subsequently issued a statement saying it had been wrong to claim Sarah Palin was a member. </p> <p> </p> <p>New revelations about the Republican vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin \u2014 including her membership of a party that wants Alaskans to vote on becoming a separate country \u2014 are raising questions about how thoroughly John McCain's campaign vetted her background before adding her to the ticket.</p> <p>Palin was a member of the Alaskan Independence party (AIP) before becoming an elected Republican official, according to party members, and recorded a video message for the AIP convention this year. The AIP's chief goal is securing Alaska a vote on seceding from the US, a goal that party leaders believe the state was denied before it became part of the US almost 50 years ago.</p> <p>Yet it is the AIP's motto, \"Alaska First, Alaska Always\", that may cause the most trouble for McCain. The Republican's campaign slogan this year is \"Country First\".</p> <p>At the convention where Palin's video was played, the AIP vice-chairman, George Clark, told the audience that she was an AIP member before getting her first political post as mayor of the small town of Wasilla, Alaska.</p> <p>\"But you get along to go along \u2014 she eventually joined the Republican party, where she had all kinds of problems with their ethics, and well, I won't go into that,\" Clark said. \"She also had about an 80% approval rating, and is pretty well sympathetic to her former membership.\"</p> <p>Palin suggested in a July interview with CNBC news that she would insist on making Alaskan issues a high priority before agreeing to serve as a vice-presidential candidate. \"We want to make sure that that VP slot would be a fruitful type of position, especially for Alaskans, and for the things we're trying to accomplish up here for the rest of the US, before I can even start addressing that question,\" she said.</p> <p>In response to the AIP flap, the McCain camp denied that Palin was a party member and released voter registration documents that showed her affiliating with Republicans. \"If the Alaska Independence Party at some point taught Governor Palin their secret handshake, there is no record of it,\" McCain aide Michael Goldfarb wrote on the campaign's website. \"Otherwise, the only relevant criterion for membership in a party is registration -- and Palin has never been a member of the AIP.</p> <p>Intense media scrutiny of Palin since she became McCain's running mate four days ago has led to speculation that the Republican party failed to fully examine her background. In addition to the pregnancy of Palin's 17-year-old unmarried daughter, Bristol, several other disclosures threaten to throw the McCain camp into turmoil.</p> <p>Palin has promoted her independence from Alaska's powerful senior senator, Ted Stevens, who is facing seven criminal charges in Washington. But she served for two years as a director for one of his political groups that was able to raise unlimited money from corporate patrons.</p> <p>Palin faced pressure to resign as mayor of Wasilla in 1997 after she fired the city police chief for not fully supporting her agenda, leading to a lawsuit for breach of contract.</p> <p>In Alaska, Palin faces an ethics investigation into whether she abused her office by firing the public safety commissioner, who refused to intervene in a messy divorce case involving her sister. Palin has hired an attorney to help her handle the case, leading to another round of embarrassing press coverage.</p> <p>McCain's spokesman, Tucker Eskew, defended the selection: \"This legal defence is neither new nor uncommon nor at all political. It is a matter of her job and is not recent and it is not related to her selection on the McCain-Palin ticket.\"</p>",
  "<p>Taro Aso, one of the most controversial figures in Japanese politics, has emerged as the favourite to replace Yasuo Fukuda, less than 24 hours after the prime minister announced his surprise resignation.</p> <p>While Aso stopped short of officially announcing his candidacy, the 67-year-old hawk made no secret of his ambitions.</p> <p>\"Mr Fukuda said last night that he wanted a successor to take over what he has done,\" he told reporters today. \"I believe I am qualified to take over [his] agenda.\"</p> <p>Aso, a former foreign minister whom Fukuda appointed secretary general of the ruling Liberal Democratic party (LDP) only last month, hails from solid political stock.</p> <p>His grandfather, Shigeru Yoshida, twice served as prime minister in the decade after the war, while his wife is the daughter of another former leader, Zenko Suzuki. Aso's younger sister is married to the Prince Tomohito of Mikasa, a cousin of Emperor Akihito.</p> <p>While Fukuda was criticised for lacking charisma, Aso has stoked controversy with a succession of ill-judged outbursts, often directed at Japan's former wartime victims.</p> <p>In 2003 he upset Koreans when he praised Japan's often brutal colonisation of the Korean peninsula from 1910-1945; last year he suggested that US diplomats in the Middle East would never be trusted to solve the region's problems because they had \"blue eyes and blond hair\".</p> <p>As economics minister, he said he wanted to turn Japan into a country where \"rich Jews\" would want to live.</p> <p>During the second world war, his father's mining company used Allied POWs as slave labourers. Aso joined the firm in 1966 and was president for most of the 1970s, but has refused to apologise for its past use of forced labour.</p> <p>He did apologise, however, for an ill-judged remark about Alzheimer's sufferers, but created uproar again last month when he likened the opposition to the Nazis because of their obstructionist tactics in parliament.</p> <p>He wants class-A war criminals \"delisted\" from Yasukuni, a shrine in Tokyo that honours Japan's war dead, thereby removing the biggest obstacle to members of the imperial family resuming their annual visits.</p> <p>Aso's privileged background, and charges that he is out of touch with ordinary Japanese, may explain his gaffe-strewn past.</p> <p>\"It is precisely because he wants to dampen the image that he was born with a silver spoon in his mouth that he sometimes feels the need to behave like a naughty boy,\" a former Aso aide, who did not want to be named, told the Guardian.</p> <p>\"There are concerns over whether he can handle delicate matters, but he knows that even though the country would enjoy his colourful side, to make his premiership last he will need to remain tight-lipped on certain matters.\"</p> <p>Aso, who represented Japan in shooting at the 1976 Montreal Olympics, is an unlikely poster boy among young Japanese who share his passion for manga comics.</p> <p>News of his probable candidacy today sent shares soaring in Mandarake, a chain of comic bookstores, and in his family-run foam concrete company.</p> <p>Aso's hard-line stance against China and North Korea has secured him bete-noire status among Japan's neighbours, but his conservative populism plays well at home. A poll published yesterday put his personal approval rating at 26%, well ahead of Fukuda (5%) and Ichiro Ozawa, the leader of the biggest opposition party, the Democratic party of Japan (DPJ) on 8%.</p> <p><strong>A daunting task</strong></p> <p>Whoever wins the leadership contest on September 22nd will automatically become prime minister due to the LDP's huge majority in the lower house.</p> <p>Though the LDP has been out of office for only 10 months since its formation in 1955, it is hard to recall a less opportune moment to take over the party's leadership.</p> <p>Fukuda's hand was forced by policy deadlock in parliament that began as soon as the opposition Democratic party of Japan secured an upper house majority in July last year.</p> <p>The opposition briefly halted Japan's refueling mission in the Indian Ocean - a small but symbolically important contribution to the US-led war on terror - and blocked Fukuda's preferred candidate for governor of the Bank of Japan.</p> <p>Fukuda's resignation amounts to an admission that he was not prepared to launch into another round of tussling with Ozawa when parliament reconvenes, probably at the end of the month.</p> <p>Though an election is not due until September 2009, critics pointed out that Japan is about to get its third prime minister with no popular mandate since the LDP won a landslide under the popular reformer Junichiro Koizumi in September 2005.</p> <p>\"All we want is for an election to be called,\" the DPJ's secretary general, Yukio Hatoyama, said today. \"[Fukuda's] sudden abandonment proves that the LDP is not fit to hold the reins of power.\"</p>",
  "<p>The \"have-a-go\" hero is a popular character in the British media, for politicians and for the public wanting some good news. A <a href=\"http://www.reform.co.uk/thelawfulsociety_376.php\">report</a> by the centre-right thinktank Reform has shown that \"The 'have-a-go' hero is an increasing rarity in Britain\".</p> <p>It highlighted research commissioned by the security firm ADT that said six out of 10 people in the UK would be unlikely to challenge a group of 14-year-old boys vandalising a bus shelter whereas in Germany, six out of 10 would challenge the group. Speaking at the launch of the report, Dominic Grieve, the shadow home secretary, gave the example of chasing a yob who had vandalised a bus shelter; the youth eventually being arrested when he ran into the police presence around the US embassy in Grosvenor Square. However, many of us who have chased yobs or been attacked confronting yobs find that the police response has been slow or non-existent. That is one reason why people do not intervene.</p> <p>My experience in inner-city Liverpool is that this situation has improved dramatically in recent years. However, a friend reported a shockingly bad example the other day \u2013 her boyfriend attacked getting off a bus; the lads' nose was broken and surgery needed on his face. A police officer stated they didn't need to rush to report the incident officially or make a statement. That doesn't inspire confidence. Maybe the officers are investigating without a formal report while the victim recovers; maybe they will contact them later and get the statement then; maybe they already have an idea who the offenders are and have stepped up their presence in the area.</p> <p>The overwhelming impression though was that the police were not interested and have done nothing to find any of the other bus passengers. They all scarpered straightaway. No one helped \u2013 if ordinary people had thought the police would respond maybe they might have done. If the mindless perpetrator had faced the prospect of being put out in the community in a fluorescent jacket cleaning graffiti and a substantial fine, maybe it wouldn't have happened at all.</p> <p>Of course it should be said that Liverpool is one of the safest cities in the country, but still crime causes great fear and blights lives in every part of the UK. The policy paper highlights a truth that many politicians do not want to admit \u2013 that the government and politicians cannot tackle crime; that it is local people, the police and local agencies working together that can. Initiatives like the <a href=\"http://www.communityjustice.gov.uk/northliverpool/index.htm\">Community Justice Centre</a> presided over by Judge David Fletcher are showing the community that the system will deal with their concerns. So are energetic young police inspectors and their teams on the ground. But innovations only appear to be allowed if they fit in with centralised policy and funding regimes.</p> <p>Legislation or guidance can make clear though that the police and public do not have their hands tied in the fight against crime. The message that if someone makes a stand to protect their property then they will not be prosecuted unless their behaviour is wholly disproportionate is a welcome one. A clear signal is needed from the centre that health and safety and human rights legislation do not stop the police and public bodies from doing their job. </p> <p>Work needs to be done on how more information can be disseminated but the basic idea of publishing far more information about crime and offenders is clearly correct. I don't know if prisons should be controlled locally but if a yob was banged up in the neighbourhood lock-up then everyone would know about it. Giving prison governors as well as community judges a direct role in following up the progress of offenders is an excellent idea. Should police chiefs be elected? In the past it has been strongly argued that policing should not be politically controlled. But we all know that the police are more controlled by Whitehall than ever. I'm not convinced by some government plans for directly-elected boards for public services but I do believe if the members of the public were offered a say over policing then they would take an interest and police figures would both run for election and be held to account on whether they delivered or not. An elected justice commissioner might capture the public imagination but most elected crime and policing representatives (proposed in the latest <a href=\"http://police.homeoffice.gov.uk/police-reform/policegp/\">green paper</a>) don't have a hope in hell's chance of doing so.</p> <p>There are key differences between government and opposition parties over grandiose flagship schemes such as identity cards. However, there is also a lot of consensus and Dominic Grieve's speech and the report by Reform are welcome because they indicate a halt to the \"arms race\" of \"we are tougher on crime than you\" pronouncements. That gives space for the police, probation, other bodies and the public to concentrate on what works in tackling crime.</p>",

  "<p>In one of India's most controversial court cases, the scion of a rich and powerful family was finally convicted today for running over and killing six people almost 10 years ago in the so-called BMW case .</p> <p>Sanjeev Nanda, 30, the son of a wealthy arms dealer, was found guilty of \"culpable homicide not amounting to murder\" \u2013 a charge which carries a maximum of 10 years in prison. Three other defendants were convicted of destroying evidence. Judge Vinod Kumar is expected to sentence the guilty today.</p> <p>The court's decision brings to an end a national controversy that had tapped into growing class resentment in India and was widely seen as a test case for the Indian judicial system, which has a reputation for protecting well-connected families. Nanda is the son of arms dealer Suresh Nanda and grandson of India's former naval chief, SM Nanda.</p> <p>According to prosecutors, Nanda was returning with friends from a party early on the morning of January 10 1999 when their BMW crashed into seven people, six of whom - three police officers and three labourers - were killed. A witness reportedly saw the men stop, examine the damage to their car, then drive off. At the trial Nanda said that he lost control of the car when he was called to stop at a police post, before driving it to a friend's house were it was cleaned by a servant. </p> <p>Nanda, who became a British national since the accident, now works for his family business. His relatives, present at the verdict, refused to comment on the conviction and looked on in disbelief as Nanda, who was out on bail, was taken into custody.</p> <p>The families of the dead have been incensed at the time taken for \"justice to be done\". \"We have totally lost interest in the case \u2026 it has taken nine years. I just want to know what the government has done for me and my children,\" Phoola Devi, whose husband was one of the policemen killed, told reporters.</p> <p>During the trial many witnesses changed their accounts \u2013 a not uncommon event in the Indian criminal system, but one which in this case led to an investigation by a television channel. This saw both the public prosecutor and the defending lawyer convicted by the Delhi high court for \"obstructing the judicial process\" and barred from practising for four months. Both lawyers are appealing.</p>",

  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> London. <br> <strong>The lineup:</strong> Nick Webber (vocals, piano, drums).<br> <strong>The background:</strong> Archangel is the brainchild of one Nick Webber, not that he's a child \u2013 he's in his late twenties \u2013 but he has got a big brain, one chock-full of ideas and the sounds of classic rock and pop from the 70s and 80s. Basically, if you like Roxy Music and David Bowie and the groups influenced by same, from Japan to Psychedelic Furs, you'll love what Webber has done for your pleasure. <br> He's got the manic energy of a man possessed: the west Londoner wrote virtually all of the 11 tracks on his debut album How to Lose Your Best Friend (there's a supercharged cover of Steely Dan's Do It Again), then moved to a rented house in the wilds of Wiltshire, where he performed and recorded the music all on his own, running between instruments (guitar, piano, electronic keyboard, synth-bass and percussion) and studio console like a dervish with ADD and a tendency to whirl. Isolated and feeling not a little intense, not surprisingly he went a bit mad down there with no company and no one to tell him when to rein things in. \"It took 18 months and it nearly killed me,\" he recalls of the project. \"I didn't know who I was anymore. There were a few crazy moments where I thought I was losing the plot. It was a bit like [the film] Papillon: I was going quietly bonkers. But it was good in a way. It was a real achievement.\"  He took the name Archangel from a scene in the film Apocalypse Now. And even though he doesn't quite resemble Marlon Brando as Colonel Kurtz \u2013 he's got a full head of hair and he sleeps in a bed not a cave \u2013 he's got something of that character's determination to do things his way. The title of his debut album comes from a painful break-up with his then-girlfriend, a split that provided the material for much of the LP and titles such as Giving Up the Ghost and Not The Man You Think I Am. He cut his teeth on a series of \"groovy Hoxton house records\", collaborating with a variety of tech-y types before deciding he worked better alone because, as he says, \"If I fuck up, I've got no one else to blame.\"  There won't be any finger-pointing with How to Lose Your Best Friend: it's excellent melodramatic pop crooned by a musician on a budget with ambitions to be a Fry or Ferry. \"Fans come up to me and tell me I've got this bizarre nervous energy,\" he says. \"It's all quite frenetic. But there's glamour, too, and sleaze. I like wearing nicely cut suits. In fact, if I had my way and money were no object, I'd have loads of female backing singers, a huge horn section and a massive band.\" </p> <p>\"Pop music of the 70s and 80s is where my heart lies,\" he concludes. \"I wanted to make a dark, up, weird pop record, with lots of short songs. You've got to be a good self-editor. You can't bang on for ages. It must be lean.\" He is, he doesn't, and it is.</p> <p><strong>The buzz:</strong> \"Eleven magnificently overwrought and dramatically fashioned songs that explore the lexicon of love with an epic sweep and neon glow that will remind you of all your favourite 70s and 80s groups while sounding utterly contemporary.\"<br> <strong>The truth:</strong> It's an impressive attempt to rival the sumptuously produced, experimental but accessible chart pop of the early-80s.<br> <strong>Most likely to:</strong> Be addicted to love. <br> <strong>Least likely to:</strong> Do the Strand \u2013 he's too busy working on his music.<br> <strong>What to buy:</strong> How to Lose Your Best Friend is available on iTunes from September 15. Archangel appear(s) at the Soho Revue on September 24.<br> <strong>File next to:</strong> Bowie, Roxy Music, Japan, Psychedelic Furs. <br> <strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.ArchangelMusic.co.uk\">www.ArchangelMusic.co.uk</a><br> <strong>Tomorrow's new band:</strong> Chairlift.<br> </p>",
  "<p>The Washington Post wonders how women voters, whom it describes as <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/01/AR2008090102726.html?sid=ST2008090103314&amp;s_pos=list\">often the harshest critics of women in public life,</a> will react to the news that the Republican vice-presidential candidate, Sarah Palin, is to become a grandmother at the age of 44. </p> <p>Palin's unmarried 17-year-old daughter, Bristol, is pregnant, a statement said. Bizarrely, the statement was issued in response to rumours on US blogs which suggested that Palin's fifth child, Trig, born in April with Down's Syndrome, could belong to Bristol.</p> <p>One website shows pictures of Palin and Bristol under the headline \"Palin Faked the Pregnancy?\", and questions why Palin's pregnancy \u2013 which she announced for the first time when she was seven months pregnant \u2013 did not appear obvious while Bristol has a rounded stomach. The rumour was finally scotched by the statement.</p> <p>Bristol's pregnancy and other disclosures about McCain's running mate, leads the New York Times to question how thoroughly he had investigated her background before he appointed her. </p> <p>A Republican source tells the paper that <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/02/us/politics/02vetting.html?_r=2&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin\">the team assigned to vet Palin only arrived in her home state, Alaska, on Thursday - a day before McCain announced her selection. </a></p> <p>Such is the fascination with Palin, a mother of five, that news of the pregnancy makes the front pages across the Atlantic too. The Telegraph says Palin's announcement has <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/uselection2008/johnmccain/2662897/US-elections-Daughter-of-John-McCains-running-mate-Sarah-Palin-is-pregnant.html\">\"rocked\" the race for the White House.</a> Bristol plans to marry her boyfriend, Levi, but the paper suggests that the news could embarrass those on the religious right of the party that McCain was hoping to woo. </p> <p>The Times dispatched a reporter to Wasilla, Palin's home town, which she served as mayor until two years ago, to see if all the stories about <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/gallery/2008/sep/01/republicans2008.palin?picture=337165827\">her astonishing life were true</a>. The reporter is unimpressed by the <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/us_elections/article4656243.ece\">\"small, unkempt looking town\"</a> but reports that the locals are enthusiastic about their local star.</p> <p>New York's Newsday discusses whether Palin, described by some as the feminist ideal, is <a href=\"http://www.newsday.com/news/printedition/longisland/ny-powome315823805aug31,0,2956192.story\">pro-women.</a> The short answer seems to be 'no'.</p> <p>The Times' Alpha Mummy website for working mothers says it has been inundated with comments about <a href=\"http://timesonline.typepad.com/alphamummy/\">\"Republican supermummy\"</a> Palin. One contributor from Washington DC asks what Palin has done and will do to help other working mothers.</p> <p>\"I have no issue with a woman who has lots of kids having a big job, but only if that woman also acknowledges that that is not something the majority of American women can swing because childcare here is too expensive, too underfunded and too badly regulated to allow for that. And that is not something the Republicans are even close to confronting.\"</p> <p>What do you make of Palin? And does it matter whether she is pro or anti-women, or indeed how she became a grandmother-to-be?</p>",
  "<p>A third body found in the burnt-out Shropshire mansion of the millionaire businessman Christopher Foster has been removed from the ruins of the house. Police are waiting for the results of a postmortem examination to establish the identity and cause of death.</p> <p>Detective Superintendent Jon Groves, who is leading the investigation, said this morning that police hoped tests would reveal whether the two bodies that had yet to be identified after the blaze were those of Foster and his daughter, Kirstie. </p> <p>\"At this stage we are not able to release any details of the body, including whether it is male or female, as until the postmortem is complete we do not have that information,\" Groves said.</p> <p>The remains were discovered across the hall from the gutted front room in the main part of Osbaston House where teeth and bone fragments of Jill Foster, 49, and an unidentified man were found at the weekend close to a 0.22 rifle.</p> <p>The arson investigation has been upgraded to a murder inquiry by detectives and a round-the-clock search is continuing. There were reports this morning that police had recovered CCTV footage from the home's security system showing Foster carrying a rifle and leaving a burning stable block after shooting three horses.</p> <p>A report in the Sun said he was seen running to the main house where, it is believed, his wife and daughter were already dead. Detectives have shown the CCTV footage to a relative for identification.</p> <p>Police are examining the remains of the CCTV system and what is left of two computers. Spent and unspent gun cartridges found in the grounds are being checked and fingerprint and DNA specialists are working on the family's horsebox, which was left with its tyres punctured in front of the main electronic gates.</p> <p>The Fosters were last seen returning to the six-hectare (15-acre) estate after a barbecue at a Shropshire car dealer's home a week ago last night. Friends of Kirstie, who was due to return to her boarding school at nearby Ellesmere this week, said she abruptly left an internet chat in the early hours.</p> <p>Foster's oil rig insulation business faced debts of more than \u00a31m. His flamboyant lifestyle, with two Porsches and an Aston Martin in the ruined stableblock, went with business practices that a high court judge described this year as \"bereft of the basic instincts of commercial morality\". Jill Foster drove a 4x4 with the number plate JILL40.</p> <p>West Mercia police, which has more than 100 officers on the case, said it could not confirm reports that court bailiffs had arrived at the house on Tuesday morning to find it devastated and sealed off. County courts at Oswestry, five miles away, and Birmingham had no comment on this.</p> <p>Officers are having to work gingerly beneath shored-up walls stripped of plaster by the fire. The site has had to be evacuated several times after further debris fell.</p> <p>Detectives have established that Jill Foster was shot through the head. Autopsies have been carried out on the remains of Kirstie's three shot horses, Scrumpy Jack, Breezy and Bramble, which she described on the internet site Bebo as central to her life.</p> <p>Friends of the family left flowers yesterday at the edge of the garden at Osbaston House. Fiona Bray, whose daughter Megan clung to her as they passed the police cordon in a single-track lane, said: \"We have heard things said about the Fosters that are just not true. We have come to pay our respects because Megan went to school with Kirstie and we were very close to the family. They were a lovely bunch of people.\"</p> <p>Kirstie's headmaster, Brendan Wignall, said everyone at her school was \"deeply concerned\" by the discovery of the third body. \"Despite the obvious speculation, I feel that it would be inappropriate to comment further but we are all deeply concerned about this latest development in the ongoing investigation.\"</p>",
  "<p>So why is it that women get more chances on the political right than it seems they do on the left? Is there something not very progressive about progressives, is the right really gender-blind, or is there something else going on here?</p> <p>Long before <a href=\"http://www.feministsforlife.org/\">Feminist for Life</a> Sarah Palin, with her extraordinary <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/02/palin.johnmccain\">personal biography</a>, burst out of Alaska, we had become accustomed to Condoleezza Rice bobbing into every shot over the shoulder of the most right wing US president in living memory. </p> <p>In Germany, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/the-big-question-how-has-angela-merkel-become-the-key-player-on-europes-political-stage-870814.html \">Angela Merkel</a> singlehandedly revived the Christian Democrats internal and global standing (although journalists still comment on her dress sense). </p> <p>What does the left have to offer? The misjudged courage of S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal, French presidential candidate of the left (remembered more nowadays for her <a href=\"http://warner.blogs.nytimes.com/tag/segolene-royal/?scp=2&amp;sq=segolene%20royale&amp;st=\" cse\"\"> private life</a> than her political success), or \u2013 well, <a href=\"http://www.harrietharman.org/\">Harriet Harman</a> ran a brilliant campaign last year to become Labour's deputy leader. </p> <p>And though it's more than 20 years since the Democrats first chose <a href=\"http://www.greatwomen.org/women.php?action=viewone&amp;id=61\">Geraldine Ferraro</a> to bring a little humanity to Walter Mondale's presidential campaign, Hillary Clinton's fate in the primaries has been widely interpreted as evidence that even American liberals don't think women can win.</p> <p>Each of the above is a different story. But collectively they raise a thought. The women on the right (who make it) share a common disregard for gender politics. The women on the left (who by and large haven't, or at least not yet) have made feminism an integral part of their public personality. </p> <p>Maybe Palin, who has already delivered for the McCain cause \u2013 er, no joke <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/02/uselections2008.republicans20084\">intended</a> \u2013 by bringing prominence to her anti-contraceptive, anti-abortion (even in cases of rape) pro-gun Conservative populism, proves that women prosper most in the mainstream. So does that mean women damage their chances by making gender a significant part of their political profile?</p> <p>And if they do, is that just more evidence of how enduring popular resistance is to social justice, or do those who are determined to lead change have to think again about how they do it?</p> <p>Some of the most prominent women in New Labour (Patricia Hewitt, for example, or Mo Mowlem) decided, even in opposition, that making gender politics the focus of their efforts damaged their party and themselves.</p> <p>The years of the Blair's babes proved them hideously right. All-women shortlists got women into parliament, but at a high short-term cost. There are now six women in cabinet, but each of them has still had to prove they are there on merit, and not because of some secret scheme of positive discrimination operated by the number ten image consultants. Nobody ever suggested Thatcher became leader of the Tory party because it was a woman's turn.</p> <p>Gender politics do matter. Inequality is an offence against social justice. But context matters too. It is always worth remembering that the minimum wage helped more women, more quickly, than equal pay legislation ever has.</p>",
  "<p><br>On hold ... the works of poet Roger McGough are being used to pacify Talk Talk customers while they wait to have their telephone queries answered</p> <p>Last week, I was having trouble connecting to the internet and, as that can spell disaster in my line of work, I called my internet service provider in a bit of a panic. Fortunately, the phone was immediately answered by a friendly, sympathetic voice. Unfortunately, that voice was Roger McGough's. </p> <p>Of course the award-winning performance poet isn't actually answering phones at Talk Talk. No, instead of cheesy muzac, my ISP is playing a CD of Roger's poetry, read by the man himself. Why? I have no idea. What I do know is that hanging on the line for 25 minutes is long enough to hear the poems on offer two and a half times. I also know I will never again be able to listen to Life Ain't Nuttin' But A Hill o'Beans without associating it with a slow festering rage.</p> <p>Sorry, Roger. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/nov/14/poetry.shopping\">Your poems</a> are witty, entertaining and sometimes even subversive and you seem like a lovely man but I can't imagine what made the powers that be at my ISP think this would ever be a good idea. When I'm being kept on hold, I want to do something useful, like delve into my in-basket or watch daytime TV. When call centres blast bad music at me, I can put the phone to one side and get on with something instead of being forced to listen to perky poetry against my will.</p> <p>When someone answers the phone, I'm alerted to this fact by the change from music to an actual human voice. Now Talk Talk has stolen this from me and I have to sit listening to poetic recitations against my will because it's too distracting to do anything else and I'm scared I'll miss my chance to speak to customer services and will have to go through the whole rigmarole again.</p> <p>It's not that I'm anti-poetry, but I am against being forced to listen to it. Considering the lack of enthusiasm for buying poetry in this country, I'm surprised they chose a poet rather than another type of writer. Or could that be the point? Maybe it's all a ploy to ensure no customer calls more than once a day for fear of being recited to. Or maybe I'm being too cynical; perhaps Talk Talk are a cultured bunch and simply want to educate the rest of us. Perhaps they are starting with an accessible and entertaining poet but by this time next year we'll all be chanting along to Milton (which would certainly be a more appropriate choice, given the waiting time involved).</p> <p>If they are determined to continue down this poetic route (I haven't dared ring back to check), I would like to suggest they go with a little Anne Sexton or Sylvia Plath next time - when my Internet access is down I find myself in a very dark place. Or if they have to go for humour, Dorothy Parker would be more apt. So which writer (of poetry or prose) would make you hang on and who would make you hang up?</p>",
  "<p>An aid plane carrying 17 passengers and crew has crashed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a United Nations official said today. All aboard are feared dead.</p> <p>Rescuers have so far not been able to get to the wreckage, but there are not thought to be any survivors.</p> <p>The plane went missing yesterday during bad weather on its journey from Kisangani to Bukavu, on Congo's eastern border with Rwanda. Ground control lost radio contact with the crew as the plane made its approach to land.</p> <p>Rescue helicopters spotted the wreckage of the 19-seat Beechcraft aircraft today north-west of Bukavu. Air Serv International, a US organisation that provides air transport to humanitarian groups, had contracted the plane.</p> <p>\"The last known radio contact was made 10 minutes inbound to Bukavu in heavy rain,\" the company said in a statement. \"Search and rescue efforts were initiated early this morning and visual confirmation of the downed aircraft was made. An aerial survey by helicopter indicates that there are no known survivors.\"</p> <p>Most humanitarian organisations operating in the country avoid using commercial flights to transport personnel due to the poor safety record of local airlines.

  "<p>Mexican feminists are rightly celebrating the recent supreme court's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/29/mexico.humanrights\">decision to uphold</a> a law that allows legal and <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/6586959.stm\"> free abortion</a> in Mexico City during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. But what often gets lost in <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/28/AR2008082801950.html?hpid=moreheadlines\">how this is reported</a> is just how recently such things seemed little more than a pipedream.</p> <p>As little as three years ago, campaigners I talked to would shrug away the very idea of abortion on demand as simply too ambitious a goal to openly articulate in Mexican society.</p> <p>It was more complicated than the influence of the bishops in an overwhelmingly Catholic country, they would say. It was equally associated with the way the traditionally anti-clerical state (responsible for swinging many a priest from lampposts in the past) had established a live-and-let-live arrangement with the church that rested on the avoidance of controversy. So while conservatives would refrain from campaigning for prosecutions of those involved in illegal terminations, nominally progressive politicians seemed unconcerned that what legal rights to abortions did exist were unenforced, such as in cases of rape.</p> <p>In the meantime, Mexican woman of any influence had no trouble finding private doctors to perform a discrete and safe procedure. While poor and shame-conscious families could be relied on to keep the haemorrhaging tragedies of the back street conveniently covered up. The most radical pro-choice group I know of concentrated its efforts less on changing the laws than on surreptitiously teaching clandestine practitioners to wear sterilised gloves.</p> <p>And then, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/6590809.stm\">in 2007</a>, everything changed. The same leftwing party in power in the capital for a decade in which it had done little more than tinker with the theoretical restrictions, suddenly <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/21/mexico.women\">changed tack</a>. It passed a bill not only permitting legal abortions in the first trimester, but also obligating city medical services to provide them for free. The issue was suddenly out of the cupboard and the unwritten hush code smashed.</p> <p>Since then there have been problems finding ways around the many doctors who refuse to perform abortions, and many complaints from women about treatment received from pro-life hospital staff. Nevertheless over 12,000 women have had terminations in public hospitals in the capital since the law went into effect in April last year. And that is a simply extraordinary fact. </p> <p>Anti-abortionists have, of course, held emotive demonstrations positioning 12,000 little white crosses on a central monument and blaring out foetal heartbeats to passersby, at the same time as the flood gates have been lifted on pronouncements from the pulpit. </p> <p>But, to the shock of many an observer, these deeply passionate disagreements have been quite manageable. And now the supreme court has thrown out the conservative federal government's argument that the law contravenes the right to life, the political debate on abortion seems unstoppable. And this is what is potentially most important about last week's decision. </p> <p>Feminists will be newly energised to campaign for similar legislation in other states outside the relatively progressive bubble of the capital. And, I think, they can expect radical pro-life elements of the governing rightwing party to counter by pushing for the prosecution of doctors carrying out illegal terminations. They may well start tabling even more restrictive legislation, although banning all abortion outright, as <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/6161396.stm\">in Nicaragua</a>, seems unlikely. </p> <p>I hesitate to predict which side will win these regional political battles, but for the moment let's just relish the fact that they are now on the horizon and the sun will keep rising and setting anyway. The story of the recent advance of abortion rights in Mexico is beginning to sound like a fable for how societies are often much readier to face their taboos than they are given credit for.</p>",
  "<p>Another day, another ridiculous casting rumour shot down. Russell Crowe will not be stepping into Dr Watson's shoes for Guy Ritchie's version of Sherlock Holmes, the director said last night.</p> <p>Speaking at the premiere of his new film RocknRolla in Leicester Square, Ritchie made it clear he has not yet secured an actor to play the sidekick of Arthur Conan Doyle's famous sleuth, who will be played by Robert Downey Jr. <a href=\"http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,24279203-5012749,00.html\">Australian tabloid The Sydney Herald Sun had suggested otherwise</a>.</p> <p>\"I don't have a Watson,\" <a href=\"http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=23155\">Ritchie told reporters</a>. \"Somebody just told me that I have Russell Crowe lined up but that's news to me. I suspect that hasn't happened and I'm still looking for my Watson.\"</p> <p>The British director did confirm, however, that he will start shooting in just a month's time and will draw widely from the four novels and 56 short stories written by Conan Doyle rather than focusing on one particular tale.</p> <p>Ritchie's Holmes is set to compete with a comic version headlined by Sacha Baron Cohen as the great detective and Will Ferrell as Dr Watson.

  "<p>Ambassador Ludin's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/27/pakistan.usforeignpolicy\">suggestion</a> to extend the scope of the military intervention into Pakistan is at best a partial solution to a complex problem. The suggested offensive, if targeted well, would sever one of the lifelines of the Taliban, who are receiving strategic guidance, intelligence and the use of a safe corridor to access global funding and manpower through Pakistan. However, it fails to deal with a variety of other groups of Taliban within Afghanistan and the larger discontent and loss of confidence in the international presence and the Afghan government. </p> <p>Therefore, any military offensive to eliminate the Taliban would be a failure unless accompanied by softer efforts aiming to create a strong and inclusive Afghan democracy and making the Taliban an ideologically unattractive alternative. <br> The level of confidence on the Afghan government and the international presence in the country has been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/31/afghanistan.defence\">steadily declining</a> over last few years. The Afghan government needs to attempt to recreate that sense of optimism and trust that it enjoyed during the first few post-Taliban years. </p> <p>In addition, the Afghan government must deal with the issue of the civilian causalities as a matter of priority. It must reach a concrete deal with the ISAF and the US forces on responsible and targeted air raids, while ensuring that an open and timed plan of bringing these anti Taliban offensives into the domain of the Afghan National Army (ANA) is in place. This would require true commitment from the international community as so far, despite absorbing the largest share of money going into Afghanistan, the Afghan army is not fully prepared or equipped for major combat. </p> <p>Another bone of contention is the international presence itself in Afghanistan. The forthcoming American and Afghan elections would be a would be a good time to pause, reflect and plan next steps including reflection on what the aims of the west are in Afghanistan. No matter what the aim is, it needs to be timed: the US cannot stay on the Afghan soil forever looking for Osama bin Ladin and the country cannot be allowed to turn into a protectorate under the disguise of development. Agreeing a timed exit plan for the international community would be the biggest sign of the strength of the Afghan government and would restore a large proportion of trust into it. </p> <p>The Afghan government has been complacent in not dealing with widespread corruption and the Afghan public have to resort to bribes to receive even the most basic services and goods \u2013 without them, the police won't undertake a cases and driving licences are not issued. Even what university you go to depends on how much money you can part with\u2026 The solution is not in raising public sector pay or slogans. The solution is in setting an example. The Afghan government must curb big corruption first. A no-tolerance policy and a number of big arrests would at least put across the message that the government does not condone <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article2933472.ece\">corruption</a>. </p> <p>The country's government should also work towards opening up the democratic processes further. At the moment, all the elected members of the government are very Kabul-centric and some law makers cannot even travel to their constituencies due to insecurity. This undermines the strength of democracy and distances it from the rural Afghan majority. Extending democratic office so that the provincial governors are elected would be a good way of taking democracy to the doorsteps of those living outside Kabul. This would also make democracy accessible to the politically minded individuals who might otherwise be attracted by the Taliban. </p> <p>If the government enjoyed the confidence of its people, it would have an upper hand in negotiating with moderate elements of the Taliban. This of course does not mean a power-sharing deal. However, it does mean some compromises for the Afghan government; for instance removing some non-controversial figures of the Taliban from wanted lists, allowing disarmed Taliban to join the democratic processes and providing an amnesty and alternative employment opportunities for disarmed foot soldiers. This has been going on for a while, but in a haphazard way, since the fall of the Taliban; it is now time to bring the issue into serious consideration. </p> <p>A range of practical questions, of course, remain \u2026 is <a href=\"http://www.welt.de/english-news/article2343557/Afghan-President-Karzai-condemns-civilian-deaths.html\">President Karzai</a> the best person to lead such reforms? Is there a need for another <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/1782079.stm\">loya jirga</a>? And should the Afghan elections happen while people's confidence is so low? However, the fact remains the people, both of Afghanistan and Pakistan, are largely traditional and ill-educated, hence are open to manipulation. These people were ignored once in 1990s and Taliban rule came about; let's not repeat the mistake. The solution is complex and a combination of militarily targeting those that turn these people into militants, while creating alternative ideologies to attract these people away from militancy.</p>",

The Temple is the oldest building in Marcuria, reckoned to be 12,000 years old, but still active as the headquarters of the religious order known as the Sentinel. The highlight is a series of ornate murals inside the temple, which tell the story of the twin Earths and the Balance. The Sentinel also run the Enclave to the east of the city, with a library housing many rare or unique books. Visitors are welcome, but please make a appointment via the Temple.</p> <p>In the Temple square is a hectic market. All humanity is here, and indeed non-humanity too. If this is your first visit to a magical land, remember, it's considered rude to stare, even at blue-skinned people and talking birds. Be wary of games of \"skill\" designed to part the tourist from their money.</p> <p>The docks, outside the city gates to the south, are also worth a visit. Ships from across Arcadia dock here and many sailors have true stories to tell of the seas. Well, for a given value of \"true\", anyway.</p> <p>The city is best navigated on foot, and maps can be bought from the Guild of Tourists (note that the Guild is closed during feast days). The best place to stay is the Journeyman Inn, where innkeeper Benrime Salmin welcomes guests with her famous mulled wine.</p> <p>North of the city is the mysterious Riverwood. Rumours of \"mole-men\" here abound so travellers should keep their wits about them. Beyond Riverwood, don't miss the magnificent floating castle of mad alchemist Roper Klacks.

RED had previously detected BLU's spying activities, and so tunnelled a secret entrance without their knowledge to counterspy before attacking the facility outright.</p> <p>Constant fighting to take control of the entire facility took place once RED attacked half the facility, the Dam and Radar, cutting off the main entrance to the facility in the process. BLU retained control over the Turbines and engineering area.</p> <p>Special security doors were put into action by BLU to stop RED's access to all areas apart from ones BLU wanted to retake, although they also stop their own movements. Access to each of RED or BLU's hardened bunker facilities is only allowed once the rest of the facility is taken due to the power required from the Dam to force open the entrances to the intelligence bunkers . Even once the facility controlled, reinforcements from the opposing side airdropped in to retake half the facility again, restarting the battle afresh.</p> <p>The entire facility was finally destroyed when the Dam was blown in a espionage activity by both RED and BLU personnel simultaneously leaving the area flooded.</p> <p>Intelligence pictures obtained from BLU and RED agencies, contracts SPY/083875 and SPY/083876. <em>Props for the pics Andy - but we could only use one!</em></p> <p><strong>Speendle, The Balcony from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade_Runner_(1997_video_game)\">Bladerunner</a></strong> </p> <p>Stressed?

From the bustling city center to the wonderful tranquility of the gardens around the Lighthouse (see attached) I found Hillys not only a beautifully designed world, but for the first time ever, a place I actually wished I could visit (minus the DomZ of course!).</p> <p>The emotional story played out across this location, and the fact that you're constantly hunting in the hills and sparkling waters for rare photo opportunities really pulls you into the world of Jade and the IRIS network. The first time you can take the hovercraft out for a spin, or the later stages where you have the ability to fly, reveals the detail and spectacle of the planet as it reveals even more hidden areas and unique views.</p> <p>I particularly like the day and night cycle where you can look up at the stars as the sun sets and they're actually named... genius.</p> <p>I do believe that Michel Ancel actually said once that there are still places in Hillys where he liked to go and watch the sun rise, and I can certainly understand what he's saying. In creating Hillys he truly created a classic gaming location, and one I can only hope will feature in some form in the follow-up game.</p> <p>Congrats to all our winners and many thanks to everyone else who submitted!</p>",
  "<p>The partially rebuilt levees in New Orleans have held against hurricane Gustav, but authorities today warned of more storms to come after the weather system weakened and veered to the west of the city.</p> <p>Dramatic television footage showed waves being forced by 110mph winds over the tops of the flood defences on the west side of the city, just like Katrina in 2005. The hurricane made landfall near Cocodrie, a thinly populated town west of New Orleans known for its fishing and oil industries. </p> <p>Eight deaths were attributed to the storm in the US, but five of were traffic-related. Four people died in Georgia when their car hit a tree. </p> <p>A 27-year-old Lafayette man was killed when a tree fell on his home and an Abbeville couple died when a tree fell on a house in Baton Rouge. </p> <p>The New Orleans sewerage system was damaged and hospitals were working with skeleton crews on backup power. Drinking water continued to flow in the city and the pumps kept working \u2014 these two critical services failed during Katrina, contributing to its high toll.</p> <p>Sea level surges were limited to less than 3m (9ft) in some places. Katrina produced surges of 8m.</p> <p>The city's eastern wall, breached in 2005, has been repaired by the army corps in a rebuilding programme scheduled to last until 2012, but the western wall has yet to be reinforced because of a lack of funding.</p> <p>The city's mayor, Ray Nagin, warned residents it was too early yet to return but said their homecoming was \"only days away, not weeks\".</p> <p>He urged residents to \"resist the temptation to say 'we're out of the woods'\" and said heavy rainfall could still flood the city.</p> <p>The authorities took pride in a massive evacuation effort that succeeded in persuading people to leave on buses and trains. Almost 2 million people left coastal Louisiana, and only about 10,000 rode out the storm in New Orleans.</p> <p>\"I would not do a thing differently,\" Nagin said. \"I'd probably call Gustav, instead of the mother of all storms, maybe the mother-in-law or the ugly sister of all storms.\"</p> <p>Gustav devastated parts of Louisiana and Texas, destroying homes and flooding parts of mostly rural, low-lying parishes.<br> There are threats from other storms developing in the Atlantic.

The first day of the Republican party convention in St Paul, Minnesota, was disrupted as John McCain and his advisers struggled to find the appropriate tone.</p> <p>George Bush, who was criticised for negligent and insensitive handling of the Katrina crisis, cancelled his planned speech to the convention and went instead to Texas.</p> <p>At an emergency centre in Austin, he said: \"The coordination on this storm is a lot better than during Katrina.\"</p>",
  "<p>Clarence Mitchell, Kate and Gerry McCann's spokesman, has joined PR and marketing agency Freud Communications.</p> <p>Mitchell will be a consultant specialising in crisis and issues management, media training and scenario planning at the agency, which counts Pepsi and Walkers Crisps among its clients. He started work yesterday.</p> <p>The former BBC journalist has secured a 12-month contract at Freud but will not stop working with the McCanns, whose five-year-old daughter Madeleine has been missing for 16 months.</p> <p>Mitchell said: \"It is an exciting opportunity to work with one of the biggest and best PR companies in the country.</p> <p>\"It gives me the potential to work with a much wider range of clients if and when they find themselves in the news.

He was being paid \u00a380,000 a year by Cheshire-based double glazing tycoon Kennedy, who is a backer of the McCanns.</p> <p>He will also carry on supporting his other clients. They include Fiona MacKeown, whose daughter Scarlett was murdered in Goa; the parents of Jimmy Mizen, who was stabbed to death in London; and the parents of missing teenager Amy Fitzpatrick.</p> <p>\"My new role will involve different ways of working for clients depending on their circumstances. I will advise them as part of the Freud services package,\" Mitchell said.</p> <p>\"I am working on a freelance basis which will allow me to continue speaking for Kate and Gerry whenever Madeleine or the ongoing search for her is in the news. I am very happy to continue representing Kate and Gerry. This is not a parting of the waves. I need to expand and consolidate what I am doing,\" he added.</p> <p>\"I am very pleased that Freud found my media background and high-level media contacts to be of sufficient interest to take me on in this way.\"</p> <p>At Freud, Mitchell will report to Nicola Howson, the former ITV director of corporate affairs, who is responsible for the agency's corporate and media practice.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/sep/18/marketingandpr\">Mitchell stepped down from his role as director of the media monitoring unit at the government's Central Office of Information</a> in September last year to handle the McCanns' PR full time.</p> <p>Before that, he had been acting as an adviser to the McCanns last summer at the request of the Foreign Office, while retaining his government role.</p> <p>Mitchell was previously head of media monitoring for the Cabinet Office.</p> <p>He was also a journalist for 25 years, starting out in print and then as a broadcaster with the BBC, covering a variety of stories including the Fred and Rose West murders and Soham.

The first time I was not frightened, and that's the one you see. The second time I was freezing cold inside. I was really frightened because the first time, when my parachute opened, I thought I was dead because it's so violent, and I thought I had passed to the other side. But then I realised I was not dead and it was all calm and I could hear the the cows mooing. The helicopter came close to film me landing but it was creating so much wind that I started to go so far and I went into the bushes. So when it came time to do it again, I thought, I don't want to live that again. But I had to do it, and by that time I was crying. But it was better the second time.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> I chose that clip because it seems remarkably appropriate in summing up your attitude to you art, in that you seem to be a person who's willing to take a jump into the unknown, to take risks, to have an adventure. We're here tonight, not only because of your films, but also because of your paintings, poetry and this extraordinary thing that you're doing at the National Theatre, where you're co-creating and performing in a dance-theatre piece without having really danced before. You must really like taking risks, yes?</p> <p><strong>JB:</strong> I love the unknown. I think because it brings fear, and to embrace fear is the best feeling. It's the jump into another side of us that we discover while we're jumping, so there's an element of trust, of discovering a side of you that you never thought of before you jumped. So imagination helps before you do it, but it doesn't resolve everything, doesn't make it freer. The actual need of physical involvement when it marries the desire - that's wonderful, because it comes to a peak inside us.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> You must have felt a bit like that even in your first film role, because you worked with Godard in Hail Mary. What was that like?</p> <p><strong>JB:</strong> It was an earthquake for me. I was used to theatre classes. I studied with my mother; she was a theatre teacher and directed, too, so it was very family-like. Then I studied with a great teacher in Paris, and she was wonderful; she pushed me but she was a warm soul. And all of a sudden, when I got into Godard's film, it was not like that at all. I was like this entity that was bothering him. He was having technical problems or weather problems or emotional problems. He was changing scenes all the time. We would wait in the hotel, not knowing when he was going to shoot. We were a lot of young actors, waiting, and he would change his mind at the last minute. One day he wrote a big monologue and I had to learn it for the next day. I was in panic; I said, \"How can I learn a big monologue in just one day?\" He said he would give me an earpiece and that he would say my lines to me. And I thought, I've never acted like this. But finally, when I came on the set, he had reduced the whole monologue to three lines and so I was completely frustrated. And it was like that all the time. But I have to say he taught me the best lesson, which is don't expect anything from the director. Just do it yourself. And it really changed my perspective; it was like I was coming into the adult world, no mother, no good warm feelings. Just come with what you want to do and share your vision with the person you're going to work with.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> We couldn't include that film in your retrospective, but we did decide to start with Andr\u00e9 T\u00e9chin\u00e9's Rendez-vous, which is a bigger role and a livelier character. How did that come about?</p> <p><strong>JB:</strong> I went through a lot of casting for another film with a lot of young actors and it went on and on and on. I went through five tests, it was horrible. When you're a young actor and you go through a lot of tests, it feels like a crucifixion because it's never right. You know you're playing for your life and your future every single time, and when you get a no, it's a no to your faith. And so I did these tests, and in the end I was not chosen for that film. But T\u00e9chin\u00e9, because he didn't have a lot of money, he saw all these tests and he saw me and wanted me. But the producer didn't want me because I wasn't well known; I had played in few films in small roles. So three days before shooting started, T\u00e9chin\u00e9 said to me that he wanted me, but the producer said no, so I had to go and see the producer. So I remember walking up the street of the production company, and I was crying, thinking to myself that it was horrible and really unfair. And looking like that, I went into his office and sat down, he looked at me and he said, \"OK\". And that was it and I was chosen. I have to say, Andr\u00e9 was wonderful. He would whisper in my ear when he was directing me and I felt very close to him. He wanted to know what was going on in a young woman's mind; I think I was 20 when I did the film. It was freezing cold, -20C, and I had nothing on. I had to go to work on the subway, I was in the lead role but I was paid less than the makeup artist, so you learn to be, not tough, but you learn that it is tough work. That's why it's always funny for me when I see those prizes, those golden things, because I tell you, it's not like that at all. </p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> What was the appeal of acting for you in the beginning? Was it make-believe, or trying to explore yourself, or finding out what it's like to be other people?</p> <p><strong>JB:</strong> It's a mystery to me in a way. You make your own path as an actor, nobody does it for you, so you have to invent yourself. When I was 17, I directed a play at my school and I played in it. It took a year and we just had one show, and the need of this show was so big, there was so much preparation. At the end, I recognised what I really wanted to do, which was to be in the theatre. I didn't know if it was in set designing - because I loved painting - or acting or directing. It didn't matter to me because I wanted to be in that world, being with other people, sharing with them. I love that. So I got my A levels, then my mother found me this class and it was the movies that took me away from that. Even though the first two years of study were hard, trying to survive, at the end I knew what I really wanted to do.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> Watching Mauvais sang, it's clear that the director L\u00e9os Carax was extremely taken with you - he shoots you like a movie goddess.</p> <p><strong>JB:</strong> To start with, it was not that easy. The first time I met him, I was in Place du Ch\u00e2telet. I was having an ice-cream in a round cup, and he said, \"You look like an ice-cream, all round.\" He was quite tough, and as a director, he had the power. He said that I would be in the film, but I wasn't sure, it wasn't concrete. But I invited him over and we had some noodles. And when he came out of my apartment, his red suitcase completely opened and everything fell on the floor. And I just laughed so much, and I think it broke the ice. After that, there was a strong connection.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> As I said before, Carax shot you like a movie goddess. You've been renowned as someone who's very beautiful - do you feel that's been a hindrance or a help in your career?</p> <p><strong>JB:</strong> Well, you have to remember that the DP on that film, Jean-Yves Escoffier, was a master at light. Both of them, they were like brothers. But I think his idea of films was nourished by Godard and Anna Karina. I said to him, \"You want to be Godard, but I don't want to be Karina.\" We joked about that. I also said to him, \"Je suis sage comme une image\" [\"I am wise as a picture\"]. And that is why afterwards we did Lovers on the Bridge [Les Amants du Pont-Neuf]; I told him, \"You've got to go to reality, I want to feel not like this beautiful image, I want to feel real.\" So he had this idea of being in the street and that was completely different.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> It's a very extreme film, not only in its opening scene in a hostel full of down-and-outs, but also the whole mood of the film. It's also the film where you play a painter and it's your paintings that we see in the film. Did you ever think that you might become a painter rather than an actor?</p> <p><strong>JB:</strong> I never thought of becoming anybody, just expressing was enough. With Lovers on the Bridge, we were on vacation when he was writing it and I was painting and drawing him. So that's how he got the idea that I would be a painter in the movie. But I think we have to let go of all the names that we put on our selves and our jobs, because we're just limiting ourselves with words instead of just expressing and being more open and exploring the possibilities we have.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> Have you always painted?</p> <p><strong>JB:</strong> I wouldn't say always because it's never that, but when I have a chance, or when I'm pushed a little, actually. A newspaper asked me to do something - it's exciting. Then I think, \"OK, let's do it.\" And the programme for in-i [her upcoming dance-theatre collaboration with Akram Khan at the National Theatre]. So that pushes me. But otherwise, if there's no deadline, I wouldn't do it.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> After Les Amants, by that time you were gaining an international reputation. You had made The Unbearable Lightness of Being with Phil Kaufman, which certainly turned you into an international star. Did you feel then that you might go down that Hollywood path, or did you decide you were not interested?</p> <p><strong>JB:</strong> I was not even aware of being interested or not interested. I didn't think that way. I was surprised that I did this film - again, I was chosen at the last minute, about a week before. So I jumped straight into this film, with the Czech accent and I could barely speak English, so it was kind of difficult. But I just thought the role was so beautiful, so I wanted to do it. So I never thought of going away, but I did want to work with different people, different souls, different qualities and ways of seeing the world, of thinking the world, and sharing. So that's why I chose to work with a Japanese director, a Taiwanese director, or English director. I don't choose because of their country, but because of the vision of that person, that director.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> That leads us very nicely to our next clip.</p> <p>[clip from Three Colours: Blue]</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> In this film, you play someone who almost gets visitations of blue, of music. I remember asking the director, Krzysztof Kieslowski, about this and his ideas about creative inspiration, where it came from. In the scene we've just seen, you're playing a character who's just gone through unimaginable grief, with the sudden loss of a daughter and husband. How did you try to find the inspiration for this role?</p> <p><strong>JB:</strong> My true inspiration was actually a friend of mine, Vernice Klier. She had lost her husband and child. I had known her for five years before I made the film. So we spoke about her grief a lot because I met her the year after it happened, so I was a witness to how she rebuilt herself. We shared a lot about her life and what was going on. So this film, to me, is a thank-you to her. It just so happened that I was offered this film, but it was completely related to her and her son.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> Did Kieslowski know that you had a friend who'd ...</p> <p><strong>JB:</strong> Yes.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> Did he write it with you in mind?</p> <p><strong>JB:</strong> I'm not sure, but I don't think so. Actually, that scene was part of the first day of shooting. I remember I was worried about the costume because we didn't have the clothes and it was the week before shooting. And he said to me, \"Don't worry, I'm only interested in your intimacy.\" I didn't really understand, but those words stayed in my mind. So that first day of shooting, we shot for 24 hours, because we had only one day in the hospital and so many scenes, and we couldn't go back there because we had very little money. So it was when the camera was shooting right in my eye that I thought, \"OK, now I get the intimacy.\" After that, I had no fear, because it went so far that first day, so there was nothing to lose.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> You've said you like to be adventurous, but when you're presented with a project, what is it usually that appeals to you first - is it the director, or the script, or your role?</p> <p><strong>JB:</strong> It's not a mental choice. And I think it shouldn't be a mental choice. It's the gut, when you read something and at the end it's like [gasps], the breath you've never breathed before. You're not conscious yet of why you say yes to a project, but I believe there are one or two or three themes in a movie that will trigger something very important that is related to your life and that's very fascinating. I often surprise myself with how I get caught, but I understand my yes afterwards.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> You worked very successfully with the late chairman of the BFI, Anthony Minghella, on The English Patient - successful not only because you gave a terrific performance and it was a terrific film, but because you won an Oscar. Did that Oscar represent any sort of turning point in your professional career? Did people start offering you lots of money or anything?</p> <p><strong>JB:</strong> No, not at all. And I don't know why it should. And also, in my country, it's well known that once you've got a prize, you don't get offers anymore because you've got the prize. Maybe you have to wait five more years.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> What was it like working with Kieslowski? Was he very demanding? He would put a camera in your eye, but ...</p> <p><strong>JB:</strong> He was not demanding in that sense. He was letting things happen. Like a lot of great directors, they trust the actors and what's inside them. It's more in the way that they listen, or their presence, that makes the difference. The presence of the director next to the camera or next to the monitor - that makes a huge difference, by the way. I could say there are films I have made before TV monitors appeared on set and after, because it changes the relationship with the director. But Kieslowski was very joyful. We were always having philosophical conversations. And there were a lot of laughs on the film - not the first day because the producer was on the phone all the time and he started panicking, but actually it went very well.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> I want to ask about your paintings [exhibited in the BFI foyer] - there are 68, they're in pairs and represent 34 films, so there are 34 portraits of directors and 34 portraits of you in character, or how you felt about the character. Can you talk about your approach to painting the directors - with Kieslowski, for instance, what were you trying to convey?</p> <p><strong>JB:</strong> Well, I remember him as very smoky, except for these piercing blue eyes, so that's how I've painted him.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> Some of them are almost abstract - the one of Hou Hsiao-hsien, he's almost not there. It's almost like he's narratives, like he's almost not there.</p> <p><strong>JB:</strong> I don't know what to say about them because it happens while I'm doing it. And I like to lose myself in them while I'm doing them. The result I see afterwards, I don't know the result as I'm doing it, and if I did know, I know it's not a good one, so I have to start again. But it was like an adventure because it's going back to sensorial memory. Some I can connect with, so it was a little painful. So I had to go back to some picture and just grab something back, then leave it. And also the choice of shots and takes, it can be a love letter but it can also be a revenge letter. But mainly there's a lot of love. You don't talk about this that much but there's a lot that is shared, about life, about the human heart, about our exploration as human beings. There's a lot unsaid, and it's through each scene that we talk to each other.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> We're now going to show a clip from a film by a director with whom you've worked twice - Michael Haneke.</p> <p>[clip from Code Unknown]</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> That's a truly great piece of acting, I think, especially when we discover later that you were playing someone who was acting. Creepy scene if you don't know what's happening. Does acting give you as much pleasure now as when you were starting out?</p> <p><strong>JB:</strong> Yes, if you talk about pleasure, it's like being in front of a nice meal. Do you have the same pleasure now? Yes.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> Do you think you've changed your approach towards acting over the years?</p> <p><strong>JB:</strong> Yes, I think so. At the beginning, I was trying too much to please, to be loved, to be the good little soldier and obey and be perfect. And sometimes, perfection does not help you. Being true is different from being perfect, because when you're true, you're perfect, but if you try to be perfect, then you're not always true. So I think it helps me to understand and to let go of the bullshit and just go for it. For me, acting goes to a special place, it's almost mystical. You have to let go of what you think is good, it's a jump into trust, and trying to reach without wanting too much.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> Do you think that you get caught up in a role when you're making a film, and is it difficult to get out of character sometimes?</p> <p><strong>JB:</strong> On Lovers on the Bridge, yes, because I lived outside with the homeless, and I went to the places where they were treated, the hospitals. I needed to go through that experience to somehow give respect to them, I felt I needed to know what it meant to live on the street. But I had to be aware of how far can I go - I think I could kill myself in a movie, I didn't mind. When you want to give yourself, there's no boundary. So when I almost killed myself, then I decided to live. Then I thought life is more important. And so it doesn't mean that I involve myself less, but it's in a better way.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> Both Code Unknown and Les Amants du Pont-Neuf have a political and moral dimension, and you've talked about how you encouraged Carax to get more real. Is the ethical or political side of a film important to you? For instance, are there things that you wouldn't do because you disagreed with them or found them troubling?</p> <p><strong>JB:</strong> Yes. There are some scripts I've read, when it's too Manichean, I can't stand it, because I think life is more complicated. But it's true, I like to see the human side. When I chose to do John Boorman's film, In My Country [Country of My Skull], I felt he had a different point of view and I felt that this film was necessary for us westerners to understand what South Africa had been through. Because we don't know enough, and the news is not teaching us enough. Documentary is a wonderful medium in order for us to understand, but we don't go to see them because our lives are so busy. So I thought it was necessary to do this film.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> You famously turned down Jurassic Park to make Blue, wasn't it?</p> <p>[Audience applauds]</p> <p><strong>JB:</strong> I said to Steven Spielberg, if you want me to play a dinosaur, I'll be happy to do it. He laughed.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> Are there any films you turned down that you regret?</p> <p><strong>JB:</strong> I have no regrets. My life is full.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> Haneke's way of directing always strikes me as so precise. Is he that way when he's directing? Are you allowed to say, \"No, I don't want to say that.\"?</p> <p><strong>JB:</strong> I think, with him, it's best to do it than talk about it. So if you don't agree, just do it, and if he comes back and says, \"You didn't do this, or that\", you can say, \"Oh, yeah, I forgot.\" So there's no discussion. </p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> That scene we saw, that was one shot - a remarkable scene.</p> <p><strong>JB:</strong> That was the first take, actually.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> And did he let you get on with it?</p> <p><strong>JB:</strong> Yes, absolutely. The only thing I asked for that scene, which is a De Niro thing, was a black curtain. I heard from some engineers and people that I'd worked with that De Niro would ask for that. I would never have thought of that, because I thought you just use your imagination. So here I was supposed to be alone and feeling frightened but there were 30 people looking at me, so I asked for a black curtain. It was late in the day, and we only had two hours of to do that scene, but they did it.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> I imagine his approach to film-making is slightly different from that of the director of this clip we're showing next, Hou Hsiao-hsien.</p> <p>[clip of piano movers scene from Flight of the Red Balloon]</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> Another scene in one take. I wanted to show that, partly because it's so delightful, but also because while you're acting in it, these were real piano movers. Was this scene scripted?</p> <p><strong>JB:</strong> In the synopsis, it was written that these two piano movers would bring the piano into the apartment, and that was it. So there was nothing else written. And actually they hired those two movers to come, but we had to wait for them to come and do this one take because they had other jobs to do. It was a little crazy, when you know that a day of shooting is very expensive. But it was all improvised. And when I asked them if they want a drink, I didn't know if we had orange juice or water. And thank God, Hou Hsiao-hsien had thought about it because that was what he was taking time with. He was not interested in writing the script or telling you to go here or go there - it was completely free. But he was very keen on knowing exactly where things were, or that in the fridge we had this, that. So he would prepare it and in that way, somehow write the scene, just being there and thinking. </p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> And getting you, to some extent, to become a co-creator if not a co-director, because you're asking them questions and they're responding. It's typical of Hou Hsiao-hsien's innovative approach to directing, and very different to Haneke, and also rather similar to the work of Abbas Kiarostami in some respects, with whom you're working on your next film. These directors you approached yourself?</p> <p><strong>JB:</strong> Abbas, yes. I met him several times at festivals, and once he said to come to Iran. So when I had time, I went, and we got along very well. So he told me this story, which is the story he wrote in the script. And at the end of the story, he asked me, \"Do you believe me?\" I said yes and he said, \"It's not true.\" But I believed it was his story. And I laughed so much that at the end he thought it would be a good film to be made.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> So you didn't approach Hou Hsiao-hsien yourself?</p> <p><strong>JB:</strong> No, it was a publicist, actually, Mathilde Incerti, who also introduced me to Haneke - I didn't know his work, so she gave me videotapes of his work. And I phoned him and told him I'd love to work with him and that he was a wonderful director. He came to London to see me, I was doing Naked [at the Almeida Theatre] at the time. And then he started writing Code.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> So it seems to me that what you've done over the years is put yourself in a position where you're exploring new ways of working that go beyond acting, in the way you're really collaborating with film-makers.</p> <p><strong>JB:</strong> Yes, more and more. And great artists, great directors, they're willing to share their creative lives. And it becomes passionate. With Amos Gitai, too, we had a very strong connection, because they allow life in. Hou Hsiao-hsien, too. By withdrawing themselves from what they're doing, they allow life to be more spontaneous and true. The actor can be a creator, writer, director because he's in the middle of it, and I felt that Hou Hsiao-hsien, he let me live that.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> Have you ever been tempted to direct a film yourself?</p> <p><strong>JB:</strong> I feel in my collaborations with directors in some way I'm very much directing. I'm not in the editing room, that's for sure, but otherwise, on set, where else can you be more in the centre than as an actor? That's where it happens. I remember Mike Figgis telling me - Kieslowski said this, too - \"It's so frustrating, the shooting time, because I'm the director in the editing room, but not on set because there the actors have all the power.\" But in a good way.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> Which brings us to in-i, the National Theatre production, where you're co-creating, co-directing and performing with Akram Khan, with both of you writing. And you're still improvising and changing it, even now. And you've, probably wisely, been very secretive about what you're doing because it sounds like a real adventure. But can you tell us how it came about and what you wanted to do?</p> <p><strong>JB:</strong> Certainly. I wanted to get close to a real artist, sharing something I've never done before. And Akram Khan was wonderful in that way. He is a virtuoso kathak and contemporary dancer, and he wanted to explore another part of himself. He was open to having an unknown experience, as I was. I think our common denominator is our fire to go for the new. Getting to know each other took a while, so we didn't know which theme we were going to go for. But by the end of February, man and woman, Adam and Eve, the big questions about how we dare to love, what is love, how far do we love - these came to us. We didn't see each other for two months, and we wrote, and then we came back together at the beginning of May and it all sort of came together somehow. So even though the expression of it can be very different from scene to scene, there's a sort of impulse that is common to the whole. I think it's terrifying - he's terrified as I am, but at the same time the need to be on stage and saying it all is so strong, stronger than the fear. We also have Anish Kapoor with us, who is so talented and has such a great vision and is a wonderful artist, along with Michael Hulls, who's doing the lighting. So we're in the middle of doing it at the National, and it's breathtaking.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> And it's going around the world?</p> <p><strong>JB:</strong> Yes.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> So painting, acting, writing, poems..</p> <p><strong>JB:</strong> Vacuuming, cooking, babysitting...</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> How do you find the time?</p> <p><strong>JB:</strong> I go to bed very tired, I have to say. And I wake up and think, \"How am I going to get through the day?\" But the end of each day is an accomplishment because I'm living my life. Life is passing through me.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> Well, you're going to go to bed a little more tired because I'm now going to welcome some questions from the audience.</p> <p><strong>Q1:</strong> When you play a character, do you play yourself in your character?</p> <p><strong>JB:</strong> Well, you use yourself for the character - you use your voice, your experience, your imagination, your hands, your feet. So yes, it's you, and yet, it's \"le plus que n\u00e9cessaire\", the more than necessary. That's what makes the artist for me. It's going into a world where you need to expand yourself to reach another self - it's coming from a very intimate place, but coming into an expansiveness. That's why movement is so fascinating for me, in painting, or dancing or acting, there is movement towards others. To expose yourself and daring to expose yourself, because a lot of actors are actually very shy. But I think that there is something that pushes them to go beyond - probably something that happened in childhood, something that needs to be said or hasn't been explored, that it goes beyond yourself. So yes, it's me, but it's many \"me\"s.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> It's interesting what you say about the physicality of painting and dancing, because if you look at the Carax films, there are scenes that are almost dance-like, especially in Les Amants, going across the bridge with Denis Lavant, which is sort of running and dancing and very physical.</p> <p><strong>Q2:</strong> You've spoken powerfully about taking risks, but how have you moved on or coped when those risks have not come off as you expected, ie when you've failed?</p> <p><strong>JB:</strong> I think failures are completely necessary and you have to learn from them. And if you allow them as something positive, then you transform them. But if you stay with the conflict, then the failure will only hurt. That I think is real failure. But if you take it as something to learn from, then it's a great mountain from which to get another view, a different perspective, like on ways of working with others. On Damage, for example, it was very difficult to work with Jeremy Irons, and we talked about it. Now we're able to talk about, so the failure became something that is, I'd say, friendship now. Also, there are so many emotions on a set, because you take risks and expose yourself so much, and feel things that you didn't expect to feel. So these emotions, they're a wonderful tool to know who you are, but they can also be mischievous and horrible if you're not careful. If you know they're your friends but you can also keep them at a distance, then it's not failure anymore.</p> <p><strong>Q3:</strong> You spoke about the difference before and after monitors appeared on set - what other changes have you experienced in film-making since you started?</p> <p><strong>JB:</strong> I think there are different styles. I did that Hou Hsiao-hsien film that you saw a clip of, then just afterwards I made Dan in Real Life, which was a Disney film. I've never done a Disney film, so all of a sudden, there were four different TV monitors, four different producers and four different frames and angles - it was all so multiplied. Whereas with Hou Hsiao-hsien, it was one take, one shot, one sequence and you were free. It's really different worlds. But the actor has to learn to adapt - that's the key - and try to find the most interesting thing in any kind of style, so that you're not feeling frustrated. So you take every second as a possibility of creation, because it is so easy to whine and say, \"We don't have this and that, why this or that.\" We all want to be the best and work with the best, but you have to make the best, try and trigger something.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> It is quite extraordinary that in the period before you embarked on in-i, you worked with Hou Hsiao-hsien, Amos Gitai, Peter Hedges, Olivier Assayas - all quite different film-makers and very different films. It's not just that you're choosing very different projects, but what comes across is your immense versatility. Is that quite important to you to explore so many different types of characters?</p> <p><strong>JB:</strong> Well, in 25 years, you have time to explore many characters.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> One thing we haven't really talked about is comedy. You haven't done much comedy, but when you have, you've often been very good. Something like The Unbearable Lightness of Being, some of your playing there is very funny. Do you regret not doing more comedy?</p> <p><strong>JB:</strong> Well, it's like when I was painting, L\u00e9os Carax told me that I was more a painter than an actor. I'm neither of them, or both of them - it doesn't matter to me. As an actor, it happened that I did more dramas, but there would be comedy moments. Jet Lag is more a comedy, Dan in Real Life, too. My nature is pretty happy, but pretty tragic, too. And I don't hide it. I love laughing but I can cry in a second. Making a comedy without being too heavy is more difficult - that's probably why I refuse a lot of comedies, because when I see a bad comedy, it makes me very sad. I find it very difficult to find a good comedy, so when I do, I jump on it.</p> <p><strong>Q4:</strong> What is the difference when the director stays next to the camera or next to the monitor?</p> <p><strong>JB:</strong> Before, everybody was staying near the camera, so the director was very present. The face of the director and the camera, it's the same. Now, it's not, because they're hidden in a corner somewhere - so they focus as much on the frame as on the acting, maybe the lighting. But somehow they're far away. So as an actor you don't receive the same thing because the presence is far away. Sometimes I get a little pissed off with some directors and I say, \"You're not seeing what's happening, you're not being with us at the crucial time.\" Sometimes it can be very difficult and you need a human being with you. Actually, John Boorman was amazing and the relationship we had was just wonderful. At the beginning, he would do two takes maybe, and at the end of the day, even though I had worked and prepared, I felt that I hadn't really done what I'd wanted to do. So at the end of the week, I was thinking, \"Oh never mind, I'll be good on the next movie, I'll be shit and I don't mind.\" And actually, Peggy Plessas, my English coach, she was there and she told me, \"No, you have to talk to John Boorman and you tell him how shit you feel and you make things change.\" And so I did. I had dinner with him and I said, \"You know John, I'm not being the actor I can be.\" And he was appalled. He said, \"But it's your film, I want you to be the best.\" And so he started opening up to doing another take - he'd ask me if I wanted another one, and I'd feel a little guilty and say yes. But it was wonderful because he allowed me to. And by the end of film, he was close to the camera, and it was so touching. </p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> Do you have a preference for doing lots of takes?</p> <p><strong>JB:</strong> Afterwards, with John, what happened was there was a difficult scene - there were many difficult scenes in that film - and I went as far as I could, I didn't want to do anymore, but he said, \"I think you can do better. I think you can do one more.\" And that took me by surprise, because he never asked for another one. With Kieslowski, Blue we did in just one take or two takes. </p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> Just as well you didn't work with Kubrick.</p> <p><strong>Q5:</strong> When you did The English Patient, you had the writer, Michael Ondaatje, on set. Did you feel extra pressure with him around?</p> <p><strong>JB:</strong> No, he was not there in that way. He came with the full happiness of being there - he loved the crew, he loved everyone on the set, so he was just happy to be there.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> Had you read the book?</p> <p><strong>JB:</strong> Of course.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> Because the film is an amazing adaptation - you wonder how Anthony got the film out of that book - it's so different.</p> <p><strong>Q5:</strong> You have worked for the most visionary directors but do you have a wish list of directors that you'd like to work with in the future?</p> <p><strong>JB:</strong> I've never had a wish list. No, I don't think that way. It happens or it doesn't. When I meet with a director I love, I say, \"One day I'd love to work with you.\" But then I forget the next minute because I don't think about it.</p> <p><strong>Q6:</strong> Could you name some movie actresses that have influenced you, or films of theirs?</p> <p><strong>JB:</strong> To start with, I was taken by actors in the theatre because that's where I belonged more when I was a teenager. I discovered movies later, with L\u00e9os Carax, and when I visited Paris in the summertime and my mother would recommend films for me to see, and that's how I saw Tarkovsky at 14 or 15 and Dreyer and all that. So I was inspired more by directors, their visions. But now, I get inspired by many many different actors.</p> <p><strong>Q7:</strong> You've talked about the power that you have on set, when you're performing, but not in the editing suite. Have you ever seen a final cut and been surprised at your performance, that it was different from your expectations? And has that changed with the director now working from a monitor, because he's now seeing the frame rather than your performance?</p> <p><strong>JB:</strong> It's not seeing the performance, it's being with the actor that's different. That way he's participating in the creation. It's not about watching me, it's about making it happen together. </p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> But there have been some films where you've been surprised by the final cut.</p> <p><strong>JB:</strong> Yes. [grimaces]</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> Have you seen yourself in all your films?</p> <p><strong>JB:</strong> Yes.</p> <p><strong>Q9:</strong> Do you think you create your own luck? Can you explain how you've been able to meet so many great artists?</p> <p><strong>JB:</strong> It's a mystery. To a certain extent, I think you create your own luck, you invent yourself, but it's a lot of work. But work, work, work only [makes a fist] doesn't make it - you have to release the hand. If it's too tight, then nothing can get through. So it's work, but an open hand at the same time. It's an equilibrium to be found between strength and force and will. It's like a boat - you have to allow the wind to take you. But you've got to be so alert - you have to have cunning eyes. You have to be on the edge. </p> <p><strong>Shout from audience member:</strong> So it's like surfing.</p> <p><strong>JB:</strong> Yes!</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> If you want a remarkable example of alertness, watch Andr\u00e9 T\u00e9chin\u00e9's Rendez-vous. It's an extraordinary performance by somebody so young and very alert.</p> <p><strong>Q10:</strong> In 25 years' time, what do you foresee in terms of your artistic career - will that involve singing?</p> <p><strong>JB:</strong> Singing? [breaks into The Man I Love to applause] Actually, I'm singing that song at the National. I don't know. I can only think of my children. If you were to tell me that I would not be acting anymore, I'd be fine. I don't want to hang on to anything. I have a wish, and that is to meet the man of my life soon. </p> <p><strong>Shout from audience member:</strong> Here!</p> <p>[laughter all round]</p> <p><strong>JB:</strong> But the rest it doesn't matter.</p> <p><strong>GA:</strong> Please thank Juliette Binoche for a wonderful evening.</p>",
  "<p><br> What the Dickens, who's that girl? ... it's Girl in a Blue Dress by Gaynor Arnold</p> <p>The one story that Charles Dickens never wrote was his own, but the private life of this most public figure was - in more ways than one - the stuff from which books are made. There's already a strong central character and narrative arc to the tale of that egregious figure with wild hair and a strange name who rose from child employment in a boot-blacking factory to being one of the most famous figures of his age. But it gets especially tasty when you add the scars of his father's incarceration as a debtor, accusations of 'incest' with one sister-in-law, the death of another in his arms and his secret relationship with Ellen Ternan, the woman for whom most modern writers assume he left his wife.</p> <p>This life informed Dickens's novels and many passages within them are based on real enough events, but for most of his contemporary readers, his personal history remained shrouded in mystery. Countless posthumous biographers have exploited the tensions between what Dickens told his huge public and what he was desperate to keep secret - but as Gaynor Arnold, the author of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/aug/16/fiction6\">Girl In A Blue Dress</a> here proves, these elements are also ripe for novelisation. Especially it gives voice to the otherwise silent figure in the background - Catherine Dickens, wife of Charles and the woman who, as Arnold tells us in her afterword, \"once requested that her letters be preserved so that 'the world may know he loved me once.'\"</p> <p>The book opens on the day of the Westminster Abbey funeral of the Dickens stand-in Alfred Gibson, but the focus is on his wife Dorothea (Dodo for short, with heavy symbolism). Dorothea, plump, greying but far more resourceful than she herself supposes, is an engaging narrator and, as noted, the Dickens flavours are intriguing. But sadly, Arnold does a poor job of creating a credible reality, even when she's relating historical events. The hinges of the story creak and key events seem unlikely. At one point the plot turns on the fact that one of Dorothea's sons has remembered an address he went to years earlier, once, when a child. Elsewhere, it's hard to believe that Dorothea and Alfred take Dorothea's second sister Sissy into their house shortly after having been expressly forbidden to do so by her parents even though it's a real enough event from Dickens's biography. Because a (clumsy) explanation is only offered several pages after the event, it just doesn't convince.</p> <p>There's a similar problem relating to the fictional Dickens character. In the book \"The One And Only\" appears cartoonish. He is always in a \"rush\". When he's not wailing and crying, he's \"doing conjuring tricks\", dancing, \"talking animatedly\", bounding up flights of stairs, inventing nicknames, or acting like an \"out-and-out villain\".</p> <p>A charitable reading could attribute Gibson's exaggerated personality to Dorothea's own flawed reading of him. Indeed, one of the appealing elements of the book is the way Arnold gradually shows us the flaws in her narrator's judgement and forces her to take on more complicated views of the \"wrong\" that has been done to her in her marriage. But every other character talks of Gibson in similarly two-dimensional terms. Worse still, when Arnold takes the brave (but perilous) step of introducing samples of the Dickens character's own writing he again comes over as hammy and irritating: \"They say I am a Great Man. I suppose that's true. I have certainly accomplished a great deal in my 58-years...\"</p> <p>Worse than all of these problems are a number of clunking attempts to shoehorn a distinctly 20th-century feminist perspective onto the proceedings. \"But does it not strike you as unfair ma'am, that a simple question of one's sex should confine one for ever to a particular sphere?\" Dorothea at one point asks Queen Victoria, of all people. The final chapters, meanwhile, have all of the subtlety (but none of the amusement) of the \"we've learned something today\" section of <a href=\"http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~smaji/southpark.html\">South Park</a>. Dorothea starts to voice to all around the sting of never having done anything in her \"own right\". \"You'll be expecting The Vote\" soon clangs a male character. Just in case that's too subtle, Dorothea dongs in a couple of pages later with: \"I'm talking of <em>all</em> the relations between men and women.\"</p> <p>It's an ugly way to tie things up, no matter how well intentioned and if I hadn't been so close to the end of the book, I'd have thrown it across the room, my head ringing. As it was, I continued, and thus came across one of the most ludicrous supernatural/ dream sequences I've encountered in fiction for a very long time. It was final confirmation that Girl In A Blue Dress is a dog's dinner - a shame because it's made up of some promising ingredients.</p> <p><strong>Next time:</strong> The Secret Scripture by Sebastian Barry</p>",

  "<p>First published: 2006, The Observer. Click to enlarge.</p> <p>Keith Hackett's official answers:<br><strong>1) </strong>None. The Laws do not specifically outlaw tackling from behind. However, performing a legal tackle like this is exceptionally difficult. Law 12 states 'any player who tackles an opponent, making contact with the opponent before touching the ball, shall be punished by the award of a direct free-kick', and 'a tackle which endangers the safety of an opponent must be sanctioned as serious foul play'. It is extremely hard to tackle from behind without infringing one of these statements. If you do penalise a foul from behind you need to judge its severity: if it infringes the first statement, award a freekick. If it infringes the second, award a free kick and a yellow card. If it infringes both and uses excessive force, award a free-kick and a red card. <br><strong>2)</strong> You must stop play immediately, take the names of the people involved and tell them they will be reported to the authorities. You also have the power to ask them to leave the local park if necessary. <br><strong>3)</strong> In a game like this you must consider the spectators: you would need to consult with police and potentially with any broadcaster. I went to a game at Bramall Lane a few years ago that was delayed by the weather. Referee Kevin Wright handled the situation superbly and liaised with police and the TV crew \u2013 and still ensured there was a 15-minute half time to allow spectators to get their refreshments. Equally, though, when I used to officiate local Sunday games I was often asked to reduce the interval to five minutes so that players could dash off after the game to the pub. And one of my uncles left his wedding party in order to play in a cup game. No half-time interval, no showers \u2013 he and his colleagues washed in fizzy pop to get back to the party and the speeches...</p> <p>To submit a new question email <a href=\"mailto:you.are.the.ref@observer.co.uk\">you.are.the.ref@observer.co.uk</a>.

She insists she was only welcoming him to the town of Wasilla in her role as mayor, but Buchanan's recollection is different: he says \"I'm pretty sure she's a Buchananite!\", and <a href=\"http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2008/08/mccain-camp-den.html\">calls her</a> \"a terrific gal\" and \"a rebel reformer.\" </p> <p>Some years ago, Todd Palin was <a href=\"http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalradar/2008/09/todd-palins-dui.html\">arrested for drink-driving</a>.</p> <p>She once <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/election2008/2008-08-31-palin-bridge_N.htm\">supported</a> the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pork_barrel_spending\">pork-barrel spending </a>project known as the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravina_Island_Bridge\">Bridge To Nowhere</a>, even though, at the rally announcing her selection as McCain's running mate, she said: \"I told Congress, 'Thanks, but no thanks,' on that bridge to nowhere... If our state wanted a bridge,' I said, 'we'd build it ourselves.'\"</p> <p>Somehow, I suspect there will be more...<br></p>",
  "<p>Sarah Palin today came face-to-face with the hard reality of the media examination she will undergo as John McCain's running mate when she was forced to confirm that her unmarried school-age daughter was pregnant.</p> <p>The revelation immediately renewed questions about the extent to which Palin, Alaska's governor, and relatively unknown before McCain announced her as his vice-presidential choice on Friday, had been vetted.</p> <p>Other disclosures today included that her husband, Todd, was arrested for alleged drunk driving 20 years ago and, more recently, she hired a lawyer to represent her in a state ethics probe.</p> <p>The investigation is over when she dismissed the public safety commissioner, Walt Monegan, after he refused to fire her brother-in-law, a state trooper, who divorced Palin's sister.</p> <p>Palin, the vice-presidential candidate and new star of the Republican party, was in St Paul, Minnesota, today to rally Republican convention delegates after being dispatched by McCain last night. The Republicans are trying to salvage their convention, which has been disrupted by media attention switching to Hurricane Gustav. All convention activities were cancelled for Monday except for essential business.</p> <p>Palin, soon after her arrival, was caught up in questions about her private life. In response, the McCain campaign team issued a statement on her behalf stating that her 17-year-old unmarried daughter, Bristol, is five months pregnant. Palin, who campaigns on a Christian, anti-abortion ticket, said Bristol and her partner planned to marry: \"We're proud of Bristol's decision to have her baby and even prouder to become grandparents.\"</p> <p>The fact that her daughter is to marry and have the baby blunted negative reaction among the party's social conservatives worried about sex before marriage. The news could even help consolidate the image of Palin and her family as typical of the average American home.</p> <p>The emergence of details about Palin's life, partly after reporters landed at her home town, Wasilla, in Alaska, raised concerns about whether the usual vetting had been dispensed with due to McCain's impulsive choice.</p> <p>McCain's team insisted today he had known about the pregnancy, the drunk driving charge and the ethics probe before offering Palin the job. </p> <p>The man who carried out the vetting, Arthur Culvahouse, told Associated Press that all the potential problems uncovered in interviews with Palin had now been made public. \"I think so. Yes. I think so. Correct,\" he said, insisting there had been a \"full and comprehensive\" vetting.</p> <p>But it emerged that McCain sent a fresh team to Alaska after he made the announcement on Friday, a move that raised questions about how thorough the initial vetting had been.</p> <p>On the pregnancy, a McCain spokesman, Steve Schmidt, said the senator's view was that this was \"a private family matter\". He added: \"Life happens.\" <br>Mark Salter, a McCain adviser, said the pregnancy had been announced to rebut rumours from internet bloggers that Palin's son, Trig, born in April with Down's syndrome, was a child of Bristol's. \"An American family,\" Salter said.</p> <p>The appointment of Palin is intended to mark a change in strategy by McCain. Having concluded it was not enough to challenge Barack Obama over his lack of foreign experience and to push his own narrative as a Vietnam war hero, he has been hoping to appeal to the working class and lower middle class, and believes Palin has the right credentials for attracting blue-collar workers.</p> <p>With the absence from the convention of McCain and the US president, George Bush - who had been scheduled to make a prime-time speech last night at the convention but went instead to Texas to be on hand for the Hurricane Gustav emergency centre - Palin, Laura Bush and McCain's wife, Cindy, led the push to raise delegates' spirits.</p> <p>The president's wife, who appealed from the podium for help for hurricane victims rather than make a politically-tinged speech, acknowledged delegates' frustration over the cancelled first day of the four-day convention. \"I know they're disappointed they're not going to get to have the programme tonight, but everyone understands it, everyone is thinking about everybody all across the Gulf coast,\" she told CBS television.</p> <p>All but two hours of the conference were cancelled today. A cocktail party planned for tonight, named Spirits of Minneapolis, was renamed Spirits of the Gulf Coast, with a fundraiser present to help bring in cash for the the American Red Cross hurricane effort.</p> <p>The Republicans are hoping to resume normal business today . As long as they can manage to have three full days of prime-time viewing, finishing as planned on Thursday night, they believe they can secure enough media attention to judge the convention a success.</p> <p>While Hurricane Gustav reminded the public of the failure of Bush to deal with the devastation of New Orleans by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, McCain's campaign team sought to turn the storm to their advantage. The cancellation of the first day of the convention sent out a message that McCain cared, contrasting with Bush's seeming indifference straight after Hurricane Katrina.</p> <p>McCain said on ABC News that he was frustrated at the loss of part of the convention but added: \"This is just one of those moments in history where you have to put America first.\"</p> <p>The hurricane diverted media attention from the Republican convention, with almost all of the anchor journalists from the main networks having flown out to New Orleans. McCain is hoping he can get back media attention for Palin's speech tomorrow and his own on Thursday. Rick Davis, a McCain adviser, said decisions would be taken on a day-to-day basis.</p>",

They listened as a folksinger strummed songs on a guitar. A Hollywood celebrity arrived to give a moving speech about the war and demand a group hug.</p> <p>But, as thousands of left-wing protestors marched just a few blocks away, this was not just another anti-war demonstration at the Republican convention. This was a pro-war protest.</p> <p>The slogans on the placards gave the game away quickly. \"Let our soldiers win!\" read one. \"Some heroes wear shoes, mine wears combat boots!\" stated another. One man wore a T-shirt with a machine-gun on it and the bold boast: \"We Want Peace Through Superior Firepower.\"</p> <p>The protest was organised by a pro-military group called Families United for Our Troops and Their Mission. Many of its members have children or other family members in the military. Often they have lost their loved ones in the conflicts in Iraq or Afghanistan. But it has not diminished their commitment to a war many other Americans increasingly find unpopular. Debbie Lee is no exception. Her son, Marc Allan Lee, was killed in combat in Iraq in August, 2006. He was the first Navy Seal to die in the war. </p> <p>\"I am here today to support our troops,\" Lee said. \"He believed in fighting this war. He believed in fighting the terrorists over there so we did not have to fight them in America. He died defending me, you and every other American.\" Lee now travels all over America advocating on behalf of fighting war in Iraq to a victorious conclusion.</p> <p>Lee's sentiments were echoed by Hollywood actor (and father of screen siren Angelina Jolie) Jon Voight. Voight, star of films such as Midnight Cowboy and Mission Impossible, cut a dashing figure in a sharp suit as he spoke to the gathering of some 100 or so Families United activists. He slammed other celebrities for joining the anti-war movement or speaking out against the war. </p> <p>\"Celebrity does something to your mind. It drops your IQ. It really does. It distracts you from the truth,\" he said. That truth, according to Voight, is support and praise for the war in Iraq and the men and women who are fighting it. \"They step up to protect our country, the values of this country. They know what they are doing and they are putting their lives on the line,\" Voight said. He said he regretted once being involved in anti-Vietnam war protests in the 1960s. \"I pray to God every day that he will forgive me for that nonsense,\" he said.</p> <p>The protest, held in the shadow of St Paul's huge cathedral, was dwarfed by the thousands of anti-war demonstrators who marched today through St Paul to protest the convention and the war. In stark contrast to the anti-war march, who demanded everything from an immediate pullout of Iraq to the impeachment of president George W Bush, United Families were firmly behind current US policy in Iraq. \"I am proud of Bush. He did not cave in,\" said Lee.</p> <p>But there was no shortage of open emotion on the pro-war side. As Voight finished his speech, after leading a silent prayer for those who had died in the war, his eyes teared up and he paused in his words. \"It's alright!\" several audience members shouted to encourage the weeping actor. \"I really do need that group hug now,\" Voight said and, in immediate response, he was surrounded and embraced by the crowd.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Peter Soar writes:</strong> How to convey, let alone explain, the excitement of knowing Leo Abse (obituary, August 21)? In the late 1950s, I applied for a job as an assistant solicitor in his office. In the interview, in the study of his Cardiff home, we talked about a suite of Chagall prints and a Picasso pot he had brought back from France. We may have spoken about my suitability for the job, I cannot remember; but when he offered it to me, I accepted without stopping to think.</p> <p>One of the many contradictions about him was that you might think that underneath the sponsor, and co-sponsor (he was never possessive) of a prolific range of social legislation, there lay an idealist. However, in Leo's case, that is perhaps not quite the right word.</p> <p>His early upbringing and wartime career in the RAF had made him a tough, pragmatic, lawyer-reformer - one of the greatest. His objectives were fairness and justice, and he used his knowledge of human beings to make the most of the internal politics of committees. As well as his legislative achievements, we should remember his command of the relationships within committees where most of the hard work was done.</p>"
