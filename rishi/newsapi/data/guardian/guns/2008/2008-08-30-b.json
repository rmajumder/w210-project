  "<p>In the wake of Anton Corbijn's Control (and Michael Winterbottom's 24 Hour Party People ) comes Grant Gee's insightful documentary about the rise and fall of the epochal doom rockers. An impressive roster of talking heads provides a thorough assessment of Joy Division's significance and legacy, but most disarming is just how down to earth Sumner, Hooky et al appear while recalling the creation of music which sounded like it was dredged from the depths of an existentialist abyss. I'll always hold the Comsat Angels in far higher musical esteem, but few can deny the band's era-defining cultural importance.</p>",
  "<h2>Great Britain</h2> <p><strong>1. Saltwater, Nottingham</strong></p> <p>The only rooftop bar in the city, Saltwater is a pretty impressive set-up; a terrace that can hold up to 250 party-goers, either for lazy days in the sunshine or slightly more energetic nights. The cocktail menu is impressive and the formal (yet still pretty affordable) indoor restaurant is a good spot for supper. Heat lamps and canopies mean you can party alfresco pretty much whatever the temperature; a good thing, with summers like ours.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>0115 924 2664; <a href=\"http://www.saltwater-restaurant.com\">saltwater-restaurant.com</a></p> <p><strong>2. The Roof Garden, Great John Street Hotel, Manchester</strong></p> <p>Feast your eyes on vistas of Coronation Street and Castlefield; not quite an idyllic Mediterranean scene but the cityscape makes an exciting backdrop for a drink or two, and there's even a hammock for total chilling. The Roof Garden is open until 10pm for non-residents (though only hotel guests can use the alfresco hot-tub so you might be tempted to check in too). </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>0161 831 3211; <a href=\"http://www.greatjohnstreet.co.uk\">greatjohnstreet.co.uk</a></p> <p><strong>3.

There's a (very) pricey indoor restaurant, but a more reasonably priced list of bar snacks for eating outside.

  "<p>The yellow inflatable raft bounces through the frothing river. We paddle frantically through the tumbling rapids trying to gain some control. Water fills the narrow three-person boat as the bow plunges into a wave. I grin from ear to ear. Our young guide expertly steers us away from rocks. And then it's over; a five-minute burst of adrenaline on Colombia's Don Diego river before we float serenely down the lazily meandering waterway for the next two hours, admiring the scenery. </p> <p>The Don Diego rises in the highest coastal mountain range in the world - the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta on Colombia's Caribbean coast. Rafting down it - after an hour's hike up - is one of the newest activities in this nascent tourism destination. A co-operative of 23 youngsters from the roadside village of Don Diego - a scruffy, dusty settlement of unfinished concrete homes and little kiosk stores selling the odd bar of soap or tin of fish - saved up to buy the two inflatable rafts. They want to make a living from tourism rather than the cocaine industry.</p> <p>With the tropical sun beating down, we beach the rafts at the confluence of two rivers. The one flowing into the Don Diego is notably warmer as it has not come from the mountains and is shallower. As we swim, one of the youths, Jhonathan Gonzalez, 19, tells me how, when he was 16, he used to work picking and processing coca. The chemical waste from making cocaine paste was simply poured into the rivers. 'We used to process the leaves with gasoline, acid, soda, lots of chemicals,' he says. 'We would feel ill with the fumes. It wasn't good work but it was all there was.' Suddenly he beams, as if to realise his good fortune at the direction his life is heading. 'Taking tourists on river trips is much more fun!' </p> <p>Not far from Don Diego village, 20 new one- and two-room lodges have opened. They have pretty palm-leaf thatched roofs and are very simple but they do have electricity, showers and flush toilets. The government has given more than $250,000 to build and furnish them and to provide some tourism training. (Unfortunately, what is still missing is some decent marketing and an easy way to book - there is no website for instance.) The funds are part of a Colombian government programme to crack down on cocaine-growing. As well as poisoning coca plants with aerial spraying - a controversial approach that sometimes destroys food crops - generous grants ease rural communities out of the grip of drugs. In addition to start-up capital for small tourism enterprises there is an allowance for those who have eradicated their coca plants. </p> <p>'We used to make about $1,400 every two months from coca,' says Richard Velasquez as he shows me around the five tourism lodges in his flower-filled, car-free village, San Rafael, with views over cassava plantations and the jungle-clad foothills of the Sierra Nevada. 'Now the government gives us $300 every two months and we have a few tourists. But the main thing is there's no danger from guerrillas or police any more.'</p> <p>I stayed at one of these government-funded lodges. I chose Posada Wiwa near a beach, Los Naranjos, some 40 minutes' drive from Santa Marta. The city lays claim to the title of oldest colonial city in South America, but is now better known for its reputation as the Benidorm of Colombia. Thankfully there are other attractions near the lodges - waterfalls, beaches and rainforest hikes for instance. All the lodges are near the Tayrona National Park - a coastal strip of monkey-swinging rainforest and stunning beaches. Posada Wiwa is the closest to the coast of all 20 lodges, but it is also closest to the main coast road to Venezuela that thunders with heavy trucks at night. </p> <p>'We're still learning about tourism,' said Catalina, who owns the two-bedroom lodge with her partner, Enrique. 'Our next lodge will be further from the road.' As with the young river-rafting guides, neither Enrique nor Catalina speak English, so a basic grasp of Spanish helps. Posada Wiwa receives around 10 visitors a month, so far mostly Colombians. Apart from a luxury eco-lodge within the national park and one beachside hotel famed for visits from Colombian singer Shakira, foreign tourism outside the city of Santa Marta is still in its infancy. </p> <p>Enrique and Catalina hope that numbers will pick up enough to support all the communities along the coast that, until recently, relied on income from illegal drugs. </p> <p>'People used to light up the road to turn it into an airstrip for American pilots to fly in!' Enrique tells me excitedly. From his conversation, it is clear he is not against drugs per se. It is the violence - a consequence of the trade being illegal - that people are happy to see come to an end.</p> <p>On a jungle trek, he directs me to eat strange but edible fruits that look like mini fir cones but taste like blackberries, and points out plants to cure various ills. After 20 minutes, we arrive at an empty beach where the surf roars. A tranquil river meanders slowly past reedy banks where egrets perch. In the background, the mountains are hidden by low clouds. In the wet season the river is a torrent that bisects the beach, but for now it's all supremely peaceful. 'This is a beautiful place isn't it?' he asks. 'But it would be good if more people came to visit us.'</p> <h2>Essentials</h2> <p>Iberia (0870 609 0500; <a href=\"http://www.iberia.com\">iberia.com</a>) flies to Bogot\u00e1 from \u00a3905 return.

  "<p>When Gordon Brown sits down tomorrow at the conference table with the 26 other EU premiers in the glass-fronted Justus Lipsius building on Brussels's Rue de la Loi, the significance will not be lost on any of those present. The last time they sat in emergency session was in 2001, immediately after al-Qaeda's attack on America. </p> <p>This time, they will be meeting to consider Russia's military actions in response to Georgia's attempt to retake South Ossetia. Those present are likely to agree with British Foreign Secretary David Miliband who declared last week that a new era in international relations was upon us: the post-post Cold War, as former US Secretary of State Colin Powell originally framed it. Russia's intention to absorb both South Ossetia and Abkhazia into the Russian Federation is being treated as a move of that magnitude.</p> <p>History, to reverse Francis Fukuyama's pronouncement on its ending, has decisively begun again. The 'new world order' envisaged in the aftermath of the fall of the Berlin Wall, an order in which liberal democracies would proliferate across the world as the United States exercised a benign global hegemony, has proved to be a mirage. First 11 September and then the debacle of Iraq shattered that happy illusion nurtured in the thinktanks of Washington. </p> <p>Now, in the space of a few weeks, Putin's tanks have buried it once and for all. In the face of protests, exhortations and furious remonstrations, Moscow acted as it saw fit in what it considers the Russian backyard, and damned the consequences, assuming there would be none of any note. This is no unipolar world, designed to Western specifications.</p> <p>In Syria, Libya, even Turkey (a US and European friend) politicians and analysts have noted the consequences of the Georgian crisis - not for what Russia has done but for what the US, EU and Nato have been unable to do: exercise their power to protect an ally.</p> <p>Trading of accusations has accelerated, with Russia's Prime Minister Vladimir Putin charging - in language that would not seemed out of place coming from the lips of dour Soviet Cold War-era Minister for Foreign Affairs, Andrei Gromyko - that the US had armed Georgia for war, and suggesting that US military advisers may have been present during fighting.</p> <p>'I do think this is a pivotal moment,' says Stephen Flanagan of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, 'not least with Russia's rapid recognition of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. It puts into question one of the fundamental assumptions of the post-Cold War era - you don't change borders. Or at least you don't if you're one of the key stakeholders.'</p> <p>Flanagan's assessment is echoed by a senior European diplomat working on the Georgia crisis, who says: 'The widely held view among people who think about these things in Europe as well as Washington, was that Russia was determined to respect borders at the ending of the Soviet Union. That is the major change.'</p> <p>But if there is agreement that one era of diplomacy has passed, there is less agreement over the nature of the new period and how to negotiate its uncertainies.</p> <p>For Ivan Krastev of the Centre for Liberal Strategies - and Republican presidential nominee John McCain's foreign policy adviser, Robert Kagan - the Georgian crisis echoes the power plays of a century ago. 'Europe,' he wrote soon after the fighting, 'has entered a new 19th century, vapourising the end-of-history sentiment that shaped European politics in the 1990s and replacing it with an older, geopolitical calculus in a modern form.'</p> <p>On the surface, at least, the return to gun-boat diplomacy appears confirmed by the spectacle of the warships of five nations cluttering the Black Sea, and US and Russian troops competing over two of Georgia's ports. But if a new Cold War is coming it is clear it will not be much like the old - or even the brief outbreak of conflict in Georgia. With a high oil price, \u00a3300bn in its reserves, European dependency on Russian energy, and wider dependency on Russian co-operation in issues like Iran and the Middle East, Russia is already well-armed with the weapons needed to fight this war. </p> <p>While many analysts have taken the Kagan/Krastev line, others are sceptical of describing the new era solely in terms of a competition between the democracies and the autocracies. Clifford Gaddy of the Brookings Institution, who has met both Putin and George Bush on several occasions, believes that Georgia is a 'turning point' but is more cautious about apportioning the blame entirely on Putin and his vision of Russia.</p> <p>'The Georgia crisis is not unique in itself. It has simply been the event that wakes people up to what has been already happening. I really think that many leaders in the West failed to acknowledge what was happening. I liken it to a financial bubble, and the implicit assumption was that Russia was weak. We considered multiple models for Russia, except for the outcome where Russia became strong and \"bad\" as defined in our terms of 'good' - which means \"like us\". No one considered this outcome because no one imagined oil at over $100 a barrel.'</p> <p>Gaddy also rejects the idea that Russia is trying to re-establish an empire or bring back a Cold War similar in scope to the last. Instead, he sees the current crisis as the inevitable reaction to the experience of Putin and those closest to him over the question of Russia's 'security' during the 1990s - when Russia veered towards becoming a failed state. </p> <p>That concern, existential in Russian society, Gaddy believes was too easily discounted by the West as a rhetorical device of domestic politics: 'Russia in the 1990s was close to being a non-entity. Survival as a grand power was an issue.'</p> <p>Into this was interposed the issue of Nato expansion up to Russia's very borders, sold first by President Bill Clinton and then George Bush, as a mechanism for 'democratisation' that would guarantee security. Gaddy says: 'That push was counter-productive and largely responsible for what is happening today. If we push harder, [as Gordon Brown suggests] it will confirm Russia's worst fear over what Nato is about. That is what I am afraid of - by pushing ever-harder we end up in a dangerous place.'</p> <p>The feeling that the world stands in the midst of a definitive reorganisation is shared in Russia. 'We are on the verge of a new Cold War,' argues Sergei Karaganov, a former adviser to Russian President Boris Yeltsin and now deputy director of the European Studies Institute in Moscow. 'It seems like a Cold War. I can only hope it will not be so deep.'</p> <p>For Karaganov, the conflict between Russia and the West has been an inevitable consequence of a scenario that many American writers have recently turned their attention to - the relative decline in US power and the unipolar world that dominated throughout the 1990s - and the emergence of a multipolar world that US and British foreign policy has been slow to react to and acknowledge. </p> <p>It is not just that the West and the EU has been losing infuence because of mistakes made in places like Iraq, says Karaganov. 'Russia has contributed to what is happening, too, by being too cocky in trying to restore its position in the world too quickly. Not so long ago we were almost a failed state. Now we are one of the world's three big powers again.'</p> <p>There will be much noise generated by tomorrow's meeting in Brussels, the likely outcome is an agreement on a series of minor punishments - not enough to reverse what has happened in Georgia, but enough, it is hoped, to discourage Russia in the future. </p> <p>Among them, it is expected, will be a review of joint Russian-EU partnership agreements; a declaration of support for Georgia's territorial integrity (if not necessarily its President Mikheil Saakashvili, who launched the attack that led to Russia's intervention); and consideration of new visa restrictions for Russians wanting to come into the Schengen Area.</p> <p>What none will be able to ignore, in a grouping that gets almost a quarter of its energy from Russia, is that the EU - like the US - has few weapons in its armoury to punish Russia, except by attempting to shame it at a time when Moscow appears determined not to be embarrassed, its President, Dmitry Medvedev, declaring the country is not afraid of a 'new Cold War'.</p> <p>There are a few unwilling to be drawn into comparisons with the last Cold War. Zbigniew Brzezinski, former National Security Adviser to President Jimmy Carter, now a lecturer in US foreign policy, believes the solution to the crisis lies in old-fashioned capitalist economics, an influence notably absent in the days of the Soviet Union.</p> <p>'It is serious, but it is neither fatal nor tragic. It is serious because Russia is going through a post-imperial crisis of leadership inspired by post-imperial nostalgia. It is not tragic or fatal, because Russia is not the Soviet Union. It is vulnerable, as the flight of capital from its stock market has already shown. </p> <p>'The difference between Stalin and Putin is that Stalin commited great crimes on a great scale. Putin has committed petty crimes on a petty scale. And what is certain is that Russia's new business elite is not going to be happy if they think their bank accounts could be frozen or their children cannot study in the West. What is required is calm, deliberate ostracism.'</p>",
  "<p>They found the charred remains as night fell upon the Shropshire countryside. For the forensics experts sifting through the shell of millionaire Christopher Foster's mansion, the gruesome discovery confirmed the ferocity of the inferno that had swept through Osbaston House days earlier. </p> <p>All that remained of the two bodies were teeth and blackened bones, the first evidence perhaps that West Mercia Constabulary are facing a full murder investigation. But the facts, as with everything else surrounding the tragedy of Osbaston House, remain as murky as ever. </p> <p>Foster, his wife Jillian, 49, and 15-year-old daughter Kirstie, have been missing since the family went to a friend's barbecue last Monday before returning to the \u00a31.2m family home at Maesbrook, near Oswestry, later that evening. </p> <p>With two bodies now recovered, speculation is rife not only about their identity, but also about the whereabouts of the third member of the family.</p> <p>As the local community gather this morning in nearby Maesbrook Church to pray for the Fosters, many will join West Mercia police in asking what was going on at the big house. Foster was a member of a local clay pigeon shoot and detectives have been questioning the club's owner and other members in an attempt to discover more about the missing man.</p> <p>Police are working on a number of theories; that troubled oil tycoon Foster may have killed his wife and daughter and then ignited the blaze that would obliterate everything he owned. Mired in debt and unable to see a way out, had the failed businessman lost his mind? If so, where is he? Will his teeth also be shortly discovered in the smouldering remains of their rural estate? Or had the 50-year-old and his family been summarily executed by hitmen because of an unsettled debt? </p> <p>Last night police were examining dental records to discover whether the remnants of the two bodies were that of Foster's wife and teenage daughter. </p> <p>Formal identification is not expected for several days, because the intensity of the fire means that forensic experts are having to rely on teeth and DNA samples. Police are refusing to either 'rule in or out' whether their inquiries will evolve into an official murder investigation. </p> <p>The two bodies, found close together in the main house, were found on Friday evening when officers finally entered the burned-out mansion after structural engineers were able to prevent it collapsing. Forensic specialists in white overalls will today continue examining soot-layered debris as part of ongoing attempts to unravel the riddle of Osbaston House. Vast amounts of material have yet to be searched and police stress the situation leaves open the possibility of a third body being discovered on the site. </p> <p>'Three people were missing and two bodies have been found. That is all we can say at this stage. We will keep an open mind concerning what we may, or may not find,' a West Mercia Constabulary source said.</p> <p>Superintendent Gary Higgins added that the gender or age of the bodies had yet to be established and until tests confirmed otherwise 'the Foster family still remain unaccounted for'. </p> <p>A Home Office pathologist yesterday inspected the two bodies before post-mortem examinations were carried out to establish whether they were killed before the fire was started. </p> <p>A cause of death is expected to be announced tomorrow, although one line of thought suggests they may have been murdered at gunpoint following reports that two horses found in the Fosters' burnt-out stable block were shot. Post-mortems on the horses are also complete, with police currently awaiting the results.</p> <p>Detectives have refused to comment on claims that bullet cartridges and pools of blood were found in the courtyard of the Foster family home. The remains of the family's three pet dogs have also been recovered from the hallway of Osbaston House. </p> <p>Elsewhere, officers were examining Kirstie's computer for evidence of a possible motive after it emerged she may have been chatting on the internet with friends until 1am last Tuesday. Friends say her online discussions ended abruptly. Three hours later the blaze engulfed the house, stable block and garage area. </p> <p>As teams of forensic officers in white overalls continue to sift through what remains of the house and its grounds, detectives are also looking into whether Foster's murky business background may help solve an incident still officially classified by police as arson, but one that the 100 officers involved understand may yet become a full-blown murder inquiry. </p> <p>One theory is that Foster 'flipped' and started the blaze himself after accruing enormous debts following the collapse of his business, Ulva Ltd.</p> <p>His firm, which supplied insulated pipes to the offshore oil industry, went into liquidation last year. Court documents reveal his firm owed debts of more than \u00a31m to a supplier called DRC Distribution and \u00a3800,000 to the taxman. </p> <p>Earlier this year a High Court judge branded 50-year-old Foster 'bereft of the basic instincts of commercial morality' after finding the businessman had spent the previous months stripping Ulva of its assets and transferring them to a new firm. </p> <p>Another theory under consideration is that Foster was targeted because of his financial affairs. Neighbours describe his home as a high-security 'fortress'. Terence Baines, a former director of Ulva Ltd, stated: 'It seems that the people he owed money to are big companies and I can't see them behind something like this.' </p> <p>However, one neighbour, who did not wish to be named yesterday, said he expected officers to find a third body. </p> <p>'I would not be shocked. The police said they had all the ports on alert and nothing came of that, there's been no sighting of them,' he said. 'You tend to think, then, it's a process of elimination.'</p>",
  "<h2>James Yorkston <br>When the Haar Rolls in (Domino) \u00a311.99</h2> <p>Fife folk singer James Yorkston's debut album, Going up Country (2002), outclassed most other 'nu' folk outings of its generation. He lost a little sparkle later, but When the Haar Rolls in - a reference to the local North Sea mist - finds Yorkston back on riveting form. The arrangements thrum with life, invigorating, rather than merely propping up, his rueful songs. Various Watersons are here, sealing his induction into the old folk fold, but it's Yorkston's individuality that beckons on tracks like 'Tortoise Regrets Hare', and the insistent Krautrock rhythms he smuggles into a Lal Waterson cover ('Midnight Feast'). <br><strong>Kitty Empire</strong> </p> <h2>Brett Anderson <br>Wilderness (Drowned In Sound) \u00a39.99</h2> <p>It's a far cry from the shimmying, bum-slapping verve of mid-Nineties Suede but there's something cheeringly familiar about Anderson's second solo album. The mood is sombre, the arrangements spare - Anderson's voice is set to a simple backing of piano and cello - yet his taste for melodrama is undiminished. Wilderness traces the course of a London relationship with observations such as: 'We kneel before the open grave and light the candles with our pain' ('Funeral Mantra'). Though it's occasionally overwrought, he still makes tortured romance seem seductive. <br><strong>Ally Carnwath</strong> </p> <h2>Brian Wilson <br>That Lucky Old Sun (EMI) \u00a312.99</h2> <p>A recreation of Wilson's 2007 concerts, this is a life in five movements. Beginning in 1961, ocean, the Hollywood hills, diners and surfer girls evoke the fantasy landscape of the Beach Boys' early music. Pastiche teeters into heartbreaking candour as lyricist Scott Bennett explores Wilson's mental turmoil on 'Oxygen to the Brain' and 'Midnight's Another Day'. Individually, many of these songs are fun but fairly throwaway, showing little evolution in Wilson's writing. Yet there is still much here to fascinate. Like his life, this is a rich tapestry, ably stitched together with Van Dyke Parks's arrangements and a spoken interlude. <br><strong>Katie Toms</strong> </p> <h2>Miley Cyrus <br>Breakout (Polydor) \u00a312.99</h2> <p>'My parents say that I'm lazy,' Miley Cyrus complains at the start of her new album. She has reason to sound disgruntled. Not only is the 15-year-old daughter of country star Billy Ray Cyrus on album number three, she also stars in a hit Disney TV show, Hannah Montana , the basis for a 3D concert film that cleared up at the US box office last February. Breakout is textbook American teen stuff, confronting heartbreak and dictatorial parents over power chords and pianos. There are a couple of surprises, however, not least 'Wake up America', an unfocused call to her country for action against global warming. <br><strong>Killian Fox</strong> </p> <h2>Giant Sand <br>Provisions (YepRoc) \u00a310.99</h2> <p>As an architect of Americana, Arizona's Howe Gelb, main man of Giant Sand, remains a peripheral figure. His hushed vocals, oblique lyrics and stylistic meandering are, granted, not mainstream material, but an album four years in the making might be more consistent than Provisions . Moments of brilliance include 'Spiral', a stark portrait of a millenarian USA where 'some are hiding in the churches, some are hiding in the gun', while 'Can Do' is a playful Johnny Cash tribute and 'Stranded Pearl' a bleak love song. Elsewhere Gelb's brooding songs oscillate between insight and obfuscation. <br><strong>Neil Spencer</strong> </p> <h2>Freddie Hubbard <br>On the Real Side (Times Square) \u00a313.99</h2> <p>For 10 years, the jazz world believed that Freddie Hubbard would never play again. After suffering horrendous damage to his upper lip in 1991, it seemed that his career as the most dazzling trumpet soloist of his generation was over. But after a cautious return in 2001, with the New Jazz Composers Octet, he slowly rebuilt his technique. Now, at the age of 70, Hubbard sounds like a man reborn. Still with the Octet, and playing the gentler and more mellow flugelhorn, he performs with impressive gravitas and a kind of bruised lyricism. The new version of his piece 'Up Jumped Spring' is simply perfect. <br><strong>Dave Gelly</strong></p>",
  "<p>Local authorities are infuriating private landlords by advising tenants served with notice to quit to cling on until they are forcibly ejected by bailiffs or taken to court. </p> <p>In what is known as 'gatekeeping', councils that are desperate to cut the numbers of homeless people on their books and unwilling to disqualify renters from council housing have advised tenants asked to move out to hang on until the very last minute - leaving homeowners who need to sell up or move in a costly limbo. </p> <p>Landlords keen to regain possession of their properties must first issue tenants with a Section 21 notice, giving them at least two months to leave. However, they cannot automatically regain their property at the end of this period if the tenant does not move out. At that point, a landlord must go to court to seek a possession order, after which the tenant is required to leave the property on or before the date given. If they still refuse, an eviction order can be granted, giving permission for bailiffs to forcibly regain possession of the property. </p> <p>The whole process - from Section 21 issue to dispatch of bailiffs - can take up to six months, though it is normally quicker. Most tenants find alternative accommodation and move out, but some local authorities are encouraging tenants who approach them to stay on beyond the Section 21 notice because, they argue, they want to reduce cases of homelessness by giving tenants longer to find alternative accommodation. </p> <p>Furthermore, councils say that if tenants give up their accommodation before the process comes to court, they will lose their eligibility for council housing. </p> <p>'This is a very, very common practice employed by local authorities across the country,' says Mark Loveday, a barrister who specialises in property law at Tanfield Chambers in London. 'A Section 21 should be enough notice for most tenants to move out, but councils have the discretion to advise them to stay for longer and many are doing so.'</p> <p>Debi Riley and her family, from Enfield in north London, have just become unwitting victims of this practice after Mrs Riley served the couple occupying her property with notice to leave. Debi and her husband, who until recently rented and ran a pub in Hertfordshire, decided to move back into their home with the intention of selling it and moving elsewhere.</p> <p>At the end of July, they issued their tenants with a Section 21 notice which, because of legal technicalities that govern the date it becomes valid, gives the tenants three months to move out. </p> <p>The tenants were aware that the Rileys wanted their property back at the beginning of July, so the family were shocked when they received a phone call from the tenants' daughter saying that Enfield council had advised her parents not to vacate the property.</p> <p>'We were told that the council would not rehouse the tenants unless they were evicted. I don't understand why the tenants cannot find alternative private rented accommodation in that time, as they are paying us \u00a31,500 a month for a three-bedroom house,' says Debi Riley. 'In the meantime, the council has effectively rendered us homeless as we had already served our notice at the pub.'</p> <p>Mr and Mrs Riley and their two children are all now living apart in separate accommodation with friends and family as they could not find a landlord who would house them as well as their three dogs. 'We asked Enfield to rehouse us, but they said we would have to go through a process to determine whether or not we are homeless. Our children would need to apply separately,' said Mrs Riley. 'Instead they advised us to stay in the pub until we were evicted, but we can't do that as we are liable to trade under the contract of the tenancy and are liable for business costs. Meanwhile we stand to lose thousands of pounds on the sale of our property the longer we have to wait to regain it.'</p> <p>Enfield council says it is working with the tenants to find alternative accommodation before the Section 21 notice expires, but argues that the couple, who are aged 78 and 89, may need longer than the three months granted. In a statement, the council said: 'Unfortunately the landlord has concluded, wrongly, that she has a right to take possession of the accommodation without regard to the law, which affords protection to tenants.'</p> <p>The council also accuses the Rileys of making the situation worse by harassing the tenants - an allegation they deny. </p> <p>Sally McTernan, the council's assistant director responsible for community housing, added that the council was 'keen to maximise the length of time someone is in the accommodation within the confines of the law'. </p> <p>'We will work with the household concerned to avoid eviction,' she says. 'What we will advise them, however, is that there is a legal process to go through and if they walk away from the property they have a legal right to stay in, we will not have an obligation to find them housing. The local authority has a duty to rehouse them in emergency circumstances - and that is only when the bailiffs are at the door.'</p> <p>If a possession order is granted, the tenants will be liable for costs, which Enfield council says are typically \u00a3150 for a possession order and \u00a390 for an eviction order.</p> <p>The National Landlords Association says that 'gatekeeping' is not unusual. 'In some cases local authorities are advising tenants to stay until bailiffs throw them out. This would then make the tenants unintentionally homeless and qualify them for council assistance,' says Elizabeth Brogan, senior policy officer at the association. </p> <p>'This whole practice is absolutely abhorrent. The government clearly does not agree with this practice. In its guidance to local authorities, it clearly states that where someone is in rented accommodation and there would be no reasonable defence for them to stay, \"it is unlikely to be reasonable for the tenant to continue to occupy the accommodation beyond the date given in the Section 21 notice\".'</p> <p>Government guidance also appears to throw a question mark over the argument made by councils that tenants do not qualify for emergency accommodation unless they are made 'unintentionally homeless' through being evicted.</p> <p>The guidance states: 'Authorities are reminded that an applicant cannot be treated as intentionally homeless unless it would have been reasonable for him or her to have continued to occupy the accommodation.'</p> <p>The NLA says there is no real advice it can give to landlords facing this situation. 'The landlord has got a right to regain possession of the property, but they can't influence the process,' says Brogan. </p> <p>Enfield council added that landlords need to take this process into account when they let a property.</p>",
  "<p>Let's start a couple of years back, in May 2006, a bright morning on a central London rooftop. Here's Steve Coogan, recently turned 40, smoking in short, urgent puffs and asking his assistant for more coffee. He is affable but distracted. He doesn't check his watch but I get the sense he'd like to. He's just finished filming the first series of Saxondale, the gentle sitcom about former roadie Tommy Saxondale, and is anxious to get back to the edit. He acknowledges that the remarkable success of Alan Partridge means he is, effectively, competing against himself. 'People want to see you doing the same thing again and again, so they have to adjust to something new.' </p> <p>While working on Saxondale, Coogan had squeezed in a short trip to Canada, where he took a cameo in a Ben Stiller film, Night at the Museum. He compares Stiller to a 'very, very nice machine', adding, 'He's about the work.' This was certainly not a criticism. Coogan is very keen on work, too. Yet he insists that while it's important, it doesn't define him; it's not all he has. He talks about the little cottage he visits in Ireland, alone. He runs, reads, writes, gets sucked into Irish politics. An aunt lives nearby but he rarely sees her. He says, very seriously, that the spiritual connection he has with the country allows him the kind of peace he seldom experiences while working. </p> <p>Despite this hideaway, the reality is that most of Coogan's time, at this point, has been spent not in a field but reading scripts sent over from the States. Or having endless meetings in LA. For the previous five years, he's had an eye on breaking America. He says he's willing to take risks; he feels he's been around long enough to absorb the impact of the odd bad decision. Then, for a moment, he sounds a little sad. 'But I might just have to accept that my peculiarly British comedy doesn't work over there.' </p> <p>It turns out that he had no need to worry. The next time we meet, in May 2008, everything has changed. Coogan is about to become a huge star in America. Hamlet 2, a comedy in which Coogan plays a misguided teacher, sold for a record $10m at Sundance in January. Tropic Thunder, a spoof war movie in which Coogan plays a pompous English film director, is poised to be as successful for Ben Stiller as Zoolander. There's part two of Night at the Museum in pre-production, not to mention the cameo he played in Curb Your Enthusiasm last year. Yet for now Steve Coogan, international film star, is in a brown-and-beige Winnebago in a car park in Stockport. </p> <p>He is waiting to be called to the set of Sunshine, the upcoming BBC sitcom co-written and directed by Craig Cash. Again he is distracted. I have interviewed Coogan several times and it's not that his head has been turned by America or that he's being in any way rude; he just seems to always be thinking of several things at once. He has a restless mind but he's also forgetful. Mid-conversation, he excuses himself, phones his assistant and asks her to send a present over to Rob Brydon to celebrate the arrival of his new baby boy. He then plugs the kettle in but doesn't turn it on. He tells a random anecdote about going to his local supermarket in Hove with Brydon and David Walliams like 'three poofs on a day out'. He finds a cafetiere, fills it with cold water from the kettle, swears to himself and starts again.</p> <p>It's not turning out to be a good day. Coogan is unhappy with the use of photos of his 11-year-old daughter in a recent article printed in a broadsheet and is talking to his lawyer. Like his hero Peter Sellers, Coogan has had a colourful private life that sometimes overshadows his work, and he gets annoyed when journalists bring up past follies. He thinks his work is good enough to distract from the fact that he separated from the mother of his child in 1996. Or that, around the same time, he had sex with a dancer on a bed littered with some 500 \u00a310 notes. Or that his brief marriage to Caroline Hickman finally ended in 2005 after two lap dancers kissed and told about an alleged cocaine-fuelled night in Coogan's hotel room. </p> <p>'I'm a marked man,' he says, throwing himself on the narrow beige sofa. 'I can't undo what I've done. If you think my comedy stinks, give me both barrels. Otherwise I'm not going to qualify anything. It's none of anyone's fucking business.' And, in a way, he's right: Partridge is as strong a comedy creation as Basil Fawlty and Coogan's private life should be irrelevant. Yet he is being a little naive. He may argue that he's not a politician espousing family values and therefore no one has a right to judge him. He may point out that he's never had a free kitchen from Hello! But he lives in an era where the majority read papers to be entertained rather than informed. That said, he has, at times, certainly had to learn the hard way. In 2005, he had a relationship of sorts with Courtney Love; she later gave a critical account of some aspects of his character. For the first time, Coogan felt the need to threaten libel action against anyone who reprinted her accusations. </p> <p>Today, in the Stockport car park, Coogan's tabloid adventures seem remote, improbable even. He is called to set and changes swiftly into a Seventies outfit including a pink-and-white shirt that he worries makes him look like Peter Andre. Coogan has known Craig Cash for years but they have never properly worked together, despite both hailing from Greater Manchester and having numerous friends in common (Coogan used to do stand-up at a theatre in Manchester alongside Caroline Aherne, co-creator with Cash of The Royle Family, while Henry Normal wrote on The Royle Family before setting up a production company, Baby Cow, with Coogan). </p> <p>Sunshine is a comedy drama in which Coogan's character, Bing, has to learn to control his gambling or lose his childhood sweetheart. In one of the final scenes of the three-parter, Coogan waits in the hallway of a terraced house which has been dressed up in Seventies decor. Cash is in one of the bedrooms, lying stretched out on a nylon football duvet. He gently directs the child actor who plays Bing's young son, Joe, as he opens his curtains to find a surprise on the lawn. The scene is replayed over and over before it's time for a break. While the next scene is being set up, Coogan stands around on the deserted road, drinking strong tea in a polystyrene cup. Now that he's on set, working, he's more relaxed than in the Winnebago. He actually manages to chat - about racist taxi drivers and dodgy builders - without appearing to have his mind on other things.</p> <p>Although Coogan is busy establishing himself in America, he's got no intention of leaving Britain behind just yet. This autumn he will spend almost three months on the road with his first live tour in a decade, Alan Partridge and Other Less Successful Characters. When I arrive at the Brighton office in which Coogan and Henry Normal are writing material (they both live locally), I find a bland room in a tower block with views out across the South Downs and seagulls shrieking overhead. Huge white Post-it notes cling to a wall: Pauline Calf, Tommy Saxondale, Duncan Thickett, Paul Calf, Intermission, Keanu Reeves, Alan Partridge, 'Steve' + song. </p> <p>Two tables are shoved together and piled high with scripts. Coogan is nowhere to be seen but Normal is on the phone talking to someone about Gavin &amp; Stacey, the phenomenally successful sitcom backed by Baby Cow. Normal deals with the day-to-day running of the production company. He finishes his phone call, sits down and starts to explain the format of the new show. Duncan Thickett, a failing stand-up, is one of Coogan's oldest characters, while Keanu Reeves is one of his most recent. A gay Mancunian emo drug dealer who has changed his name by deed poll and who Coogan plays in series two of Saxondale, Keanu is making his live debut. As is Tommy Saxondale. There are also old favourites Paul Calf, the beer-swilling student hater, and his blonde bouffant-haired sister, Pauline.</p> <p>Normal and I are trying to work out which characters Coogan performed at his first Edinburgh show in 1990. I was there to interview Frank Skinner, who was supporting, but barely noticed Coogan; I saw him again two years later when he put on an amazing show in a packed, sweaty room with John Thomson and won the Perrier Award. As we are talking, Coogan appears at the door, flings a golf jumper over his shoulder and on to the floor. He puts a coffee and a chocolate brownie on the table, apologises for being late and blows his nose. A pair of black, modern Ray-Bans sit on top of his head, his crumpled T-shirt is white, his ribbed trousers brown and his running shoes blue. He is full of cold.</p> <p>'I mostly did impressions at Edinburgh in 1990,' says Coogan, sitting down opposite Normal. 'I skipped the next year because I wanted to get the show dead right. So in 1991 I went to Rhodes with my act. It was a holiday job. I was by the pool doing my job in front of a load of families. This man came up and said, \"Can you stop swearing please, there are kids around.\" I'd already done Spitting Image by then, I'd appeared at the London Palladium with Jimmy Tarbuck. And there I was staying in a box room with no windows. It was a real cheapo, nasty set-up. I bought a Guardian International one day and saw the headline, \"Frank Skinner wins Perrier Award in Edinburgh\". The year before he'd been supporting me in Edinburgh.' </p> <p>Coogan sighs. 'I asked my agent at the time what I could do. She told me to pull a rabbit out of a hat. I was slightly neurotic, feeling that the grown-up comics on the circuit saw me as a low-rent, low-brow funny voice man. So I took the new show to regional arts centres, avoiding London completely. By the time I got to Edinburgh, John Thomson was supporting me and Patrick Marber was directing. He got the show down to about an hour. I did Paul Calf and Duncan Thickett. Nobody was doing stand-up characters at the time and the element of surprise is very important.' His laugh is high-pitched, slightly self-conscious. 'Both in military and comic situations.' </p> <p>Henry Normal is keen to get on with planning the impending live show. 'So Paul Calf comes on stage in an electric wheelchair and we think he's got a broken leg, but it's a ruse.' I ask if all these characters age, which of course they do, but not in real terms. Normal explains that it's more a case of creating a modern context, so that Pauline Calf can, for example, send flirtatious text messages. I see Amy Winehouse's name on one of the many lists littering the tables. 'Yes, but it's a shit joke so we won't be using it,' says Coogan, sliding the paper away. He smiles. 'The overall problem of the show is how to make it accessible to a large group of people but to also imbue it with an edge and tension. To make it risqu\u00e9 but also digestible.'</p> <p>Is there an assumption that most of the audience will be familiar only with Alan Partridge? 'I'd say it's the case with around 50 per cent. There's no point pretending. Hence the name of the show.' Partridge gets 29 minutes, as opposed to 12 minutes for each of the others. His segment will include a look at his new job as a lifestyle guru, following years in the wilderness after his TV chat-show was axed. 'He's going around doing a cheap, low-rent version of a lifestyle guru lecture that people do in America but that doesn't really float in this country,' says Coogan. 'He's been to America, seen these guys and thinks it may be his way back. He thinks he's had some Damascene conversion and he'll be able to impart this wisdom that's changed his life.'</p> <p>The final nine minutes of the show involve Coogan coming on as a version of himself (not unlike the conceit of Michael Winterbottom's excellent adaptation of A Cock and Bull Story in which Coogan co-starred with Rob Brydon). 'I want to get postmodern and self-indulgent, and see if it works.' </p> <p>Back in Stockport, Coogan had mentioned that he was contemplating a number for the tour called 'The Cunt Song'. He's still worried about it. Normal isn't. He thinks it's a great way of listing all the unpleasant people of the modern world. He says it's just an updated version of Paul Calf's 'Bag O' Shite' song. But Coogan, who likes his comedy clever as well as funny, and who is very careful about what he presents to an audience, is concerned. A long discussion ensues. Coogan: 'The word \"cunt\" is deeply offensive to a lot of people, especially women. There are political connotations. You can't say it in America. Period. Full stop. Which is why I'm interested in it.' Normal: 'I think we're desensitised to it.' Coogan: 'I don't. My show has a broad appeal. There are 12-year-old fans of Alan Partridge.' Normal: 'I'm a firm believer in the Lenny Bruce school of thought: if you clamp down on a word, you give it power.' Coogan puts his head in his hands. His cold has given him a thick head. 'OK, I want to use it because it's taboo. And sometimes people laugh at things despite themselves. You can defeat their moral and ethical objections with laughter.' </p> <p>Later we drive to Coogan's house in his old Porsche. He's lived in Hove for 10 years, although he spends almost half the year in America these days. If it wasn't for his daughter, he would consider moving there. His large, spacious house is overflowing with his brother, his brother's family and his own daughter. His girlfriend China Chow, daughter of restaurateur Michael Chow and the late model Tina Chow, is sitting on a sofa eating a plate of sliced fennel dressed with oil and lemon. She, too, is full of cold but jumps up to introduce herself, make tea and find remedies for Coogan. She is full of tenderness but he just wants to get on with the interview.</p> <p>In the study, Coogan sits in a leather Robin Day armchair. He sips herbal tea. There are old movie posters of Thunderball and Alfie, random Post-it notes (one says 'ass man' - Chow saw an assistant manager in a shop with his abbreviated title on his badge) and copies of Hello! and OK! - 'because I didn't know who anyone was when I got back from America,' explains Coogan, moving them out of sight. He likes America. 'It's a change of landscape. I work with other people who are very talented. It energises me, excites me. But you have to be tenacious. The Dorothy Parker quote that you can be killed by encouragement in Hollywood is very true. Everyone tells you how great you are in case you turn out to be.' </p> <p>American critics have been writing about Coogan's greatness since they saw his portrayal of the late Tony Wilson in Michael Winterbottom's 24 Hour Party People in 2002. Then, after his perfectly judged performance as a big-headed British actor in Jim Jarmusch's Coffee and Cigarettes in 2003, he became not only a cult figure, but also cool. And despite - or perhaps because of - Alan Partridge's idiosyncratic Little Englander behaviour, they fell in love with him, too. Coogan's cult status is now in question: he may have cemented it with last year's appearance on Curb Your Enthusiasm ('I had to make sure I wasn't intimidated') but with Hamlet 2's record sale at Sundance and the inevitable success of Tropic Thunder, he will soon be a household name in America.</p> <p>Still, modestly, he describes going to Hollywood as 'an experiment'; it will be a 'bonus' if he finds real success there. Yet he says Hamlet 2 is 'smart', a good, broad comedy. 'I love all inclusive comedy. I like watching The Two Ronnies with my parents.' However, it's clearly Tropic Thunder that excites him. In a private screening a few days earlier, he laughed the whole way through. Then, at the end, he said with the genuine enthusiasm of a fan that it was one of the funniest films he'd ever seen. Especially after the first 20 minutes, when he's no longer in it. He is still animated now. 'Tropic Thunder is superb. It's Ben Stiller's shining moment as a director. It's game changing for comedy.' </p> <p>Although Hollywood clearly pays better than the BBC, Coogan insists that he didn't go to the States because he was greedy for more. What he says next comes as something of a surprise, given his widely acknowledged status as a comedy genius over here. 'I don't actually get offered that much work in Britain. People fear working with me because they see me as an auteur and I might cramp their style. I even had to convince Craig [Cash] that if he let me do Sunshine, I'd be there to do a job as an actor.' He sighs; he often feels misunderstood. Perhaps this is due in part to the fact that he's simply a hard person to get to know, especially when distracted.</p> <p>Even his lower middle-class, Catholic, socialist family (Steve was the fourth of six and his parents took in various foster children) remember him as a brilliant impressionist who lived in a world of his own as a child. Henry Normal says his Baby Cow partner 'feels disconnected from the world. Comedy is one way he makes that connection'. And it is, of course, a very particular type of comedy. He likes gauche characters with visible imperfections. 'Creating such characters was never conscious,' Coogan insists. 'There's just something funny about people being delusional and self-deprecating. I like the catharsis of trying to make comedy out of failure.' </p> <p>He is frustrated when fans ask him if he makes up material as he goes along. 'The discipline of structured writing with a team isn't self-evident. But the cruel trick of comedy is that the easier it looks, the harder it's been to create.' For a while, around the turn of the century, Coogan lost his way; making people laugh became too much like hard work. He'd won lots of awards, made lots of money, enjoyed phenomenal success with Alan Partridge. Professional lethargy set in. 'Then I realised there was no magic answer to anything. Just get on with the work.' He repeats this mantra several times to himself, as though alone in the room. 'That's where I find peace. It's as simple as: this is what I do, do you like it?' He pauses. 'When Baby Cow was set up in 1999 it really did give me some much-needed structure.'</p> <p>I wonder if, despite his own ascendancy in America, Coogan is envious of Gavin &amp; Stacey's success in this country. 'A tiny bit of me is, yes. But it's a part I recognise exists. I'm able to stand back and see that it's absolutely ridiculous. I also know that the company Henry and I run enabled them to have that success. I'm 42 now, I'm part of the furniture in this country.' His daughter knocks on the door and asks where to find some playing cards. He pulls himself up. 'The simple answer to Gavin &amp; Stacey's success is that I'm mostly pleased but a tiny bit envious. Then I remember that I have to get on with it. To find a calmness in just moving forwards.' And, having made a statement worthy of self-help guru Alan Partridge, he follows his daughter down the stairs, the interview already forgotten.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Sunshine is on BBC1 in early October; Tropic Thunder is out on 19 September</p>",

  "<h2>Letter of the week</h2> <p>My wife and I are considering a holiday in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Tennessee, and though we're told it's the most-visited park in the US, it's not easy to work out the best way to get there. Can you help? Any suggestions for accommodation around the park would also be helpful. Are nearby Nashville and Chattanooga worth a trip away from the park?<br><strong>Ken Butcher, Birchington</strong></p> <p>Great Smoky is famed for its mountain scenery, waterfalls and historic buildings. Despite the 'most-visited' tag, if you can visit outside mid-June to mid-August and weekends in October, you'll avoid most of the crowds. The best way to experience the park is to stay at campgrounds - see <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/grsm\">nps.gov/grsm</a>. Alternatively, towns such as Gatlinburg, Pigeon Forge (the home of Dollywood, the theme park in honour of Ms Parton), Townsend in Tennessee, and Bryson City and Maggie Valley in North Carolina have a wide range of lodgings and places to buy provisions. You'll need to hire a car to get about the park. </p> <p>Neither Knoxville, Tennessee or Asheville, North Carolina, both nearby, have direct flights to the UK, but Charlotte, North Carolina, about 130 miles from the park, does, with US Airways from Heathrow (<a href=\"http://www.usairways.com\">usairways.com</a>; from \u00a3506 return). Nashville and Chattanooga are within reach, but if you have more time, I'd use it to explore remoter areas of Great Smoky, such as Cataloochee Valley.</p> <p><strong>Q </strong>I have around five days free between jobs in September and am keen to join a group holiday. Ideally I would like to go somewhere hot in Europe where I can take in great scenery. A walking holiday would be of interest. Do you have any tips/websites I should check out?<br><strong>Paul Silton, London</strong></p> <p><strong>A </strong>The earlier you can go in September, the warmer the weather everywhere in Europe. And while our own terrible summer has prompted a strong market for late bookings you should be able to find something that fits the bill. You would be pretty much guaranteed heat on a walking tour of Turkey's Turquoise Coast, and if you can stretch to eight days, Exodus (0845 863 9600; <a href=\"http://www.exodus.co.uk\">exodus.co.uk</a>) offers small group tours from \u00a3517 including flights. Explore Worldwide (0845 013 1537; <a href=\"http://www.explore.co.uk\">explore.co.uk</a>) has limited availability for September departures on a tempting-sounding seven-day Corsican Villages trek, including some sections of the famous GR20 long-distance walk across the island, for \u00a3869. Also try Walks Worldwide (<a href=\"http://www.walksworldwide.com\">walksworldwide.com</a>).</p> <p><strong>Q </strong>My husband has arranged to meet our daughter in Santiago, Chile, during her gap year in South America. They will be together from 6-19 January. This will be the first time either of them has been to this part of the world and they would like to see something of Chile and/or Argentina, whether on an organised trip or travelling independently. Trekking is a possibility, but neither wants to undertake anything too strenuous or adventurous. The Torres del Paine National Park, Patagonia, or Chilean Lake District are all areas which have been recommended to us. My husband would also be keen to see other cities, particularly Buenos Aires. Could you suggest an itinerary?<br><strong>Mrs C Walker, Ealing, London</strong></p> <p><strong>A </strong>Thirteen days isn't long - your family will need to take at least one flight and probably more to avoid spending too much time on buses. A hop over to Buenos Aires might be pushing it on this trip, because you will need a minimum of three days to see the city. Chile itself is a big country with a lot to see, and it has its own underrated capital which you will need a few days to explore in detail. So save Argentina for another time.</p> <p>On both my visits to the country I've visited Torres del Paine National Park and it justifies its tag as one of the continent's highlights. You will need to fly to get there, however: Punta Arenas is the nearest airport with direct flights from Santiago and easy bus transport on to Puerto Natales. You can easily arrange transport to the park and hiking equipment in either Santiago or Puerto Natales. As you are travelling at a busy time you may wish to make reservations. In the latter, try agency Chile Nativo (<a href=\"http://www.chilenativo.cl\">chilenativo.cl</a>) for trips to the park.</p> <p>The Chilean Lake District is much closer to Santiago - though it is still a whole day away by bus or a three-hour flight to Puerto Montt. Puerto Varas, an hour away by road from Puerto Montt, is the best base for exploring the region. You can easily arrange transport from here to Vicente P\u00e9rez Rosales National Park. Many travellers passing through here are on their way to Bariloche in Argentina via a combination of scenic bus and boat rides, but there is great walking around Petrohue and Peulla. If you are feeling intrepid you can also arrange a climbing trip up Volc\u00e1n Osorno. You should also try to squeeze in a trip to the fun port city of Valpara\u00edso. Good-value hospedajes (B&amp;Bs) in hillside areas fill up fast - see <a href=\"http://www.granvalparaiso.cl\">granvalparaiso.cl</a>.</p> <p><strong>Q </strong>I wonder if you know of a strong lightweight suitcase? My wife and I are hoping to do more travelling next year and with the limitations on baggage for flights we want to maximise the weight available for clothes and presents. If we are going to more rugged places, then we want them to be robust and we are not too worried about the cost.<br><strong>Norman Howe, Wakefield</strong></p> <p><strong>A </strong>Bob Deering, at specialist luggage retailer Go Places (01795 476922; <a href=\"http://www.goplaces.co.uk\">goplaces.co.uk</a>), says that lightweight and robust tend to be at different ends of the luggage spectrum and that you will need to decide which is more important. Antler's Size Zero range is probably the lightest on the market, with the Antler Aeon Air stronger but a bit heavier. Also worth considering is the Briggs &amp; Reilly range, which comes with a lifetime guarantee that includes airline damage. However, Bob suggests the best compromise overall is the Antler Tronic Z500 range, which includes a large case measuring 73 x 53 x 27/33cm (it's expandable) and weighing 5.1kg. It costs \u00a3135 at Go Places.</p>",
  "<p>Middlesbrough for Europe anyone? OK, so two wins from three league games plus a 5-1 victory over Yeovil in the Carling Cup don't make a season, yet judging by their results and performances so far they might just be worth a flutter. Gareth Southgate's side are showing the kind of attacking flair that was all too often absent last season.</p> <p>Yesterday Middlesbrough were strangely lethargic during the opening half-hour, only managing to find their step following the deserved dismissal of Amdy Faye after 36 minutes for a reckless challenge on Mohamed Shawky. From that point on, however, the Teessiders played some scintillating football, their only undoing being the number of chances they wasted before Tuncay managed to control a mishit shot by Didier Digard with five minutes remaining to beat the advancing Thomas Sorensen from just inside the box.</p> <p>Credit goes to Stoke as well for the way they stuck at it, having gone a man down. At one stage it even looked as though they might steal a point, but, Amdy Faye take note, in the Premiership you can not go around clattering into players in central positions 25 yards from your own goal. The resulting free-kick saw Afonso Alves steer a delicious shot into the top right-hand corner of Sorensen's net to give Middlesbrough the kickstart they so desperately needed. The only consolation for City is that up until then they had more than held their own.</p> <p>'The sending-off changed the game, without a question of a doubt,' Stoke manager Tony Pulis rightly claimed afterwards. 'It's a good decision. We've had a man come round telling us that if people leave the ground with two feet then they will be sent off, so we have got no qualms there. I think Mike [Dean] has made the right decision. But up until that point we were enjoying ourselves.</p> <p>'We've got players in the team that can cause problems. Yes, Rory [Delap] throws a long ball in. Yes, we are good at set plays, which we work very hard on, but we've got players that can play some football as well. When Middlesbrough had the extra man and were passing it round us we kept going and going and that's the spirit we've got at this football club.'</p> <p>Handed a numerical advantage in terms of goals and manpower, Middlesbrough stopped hiding and started playing the kind of football that has made them one of the surprise packages of the season so far. Shame about the final product, though. Sorensen produced a couple of excellent saves, but Southgate's men should have been home and dry with a third of the game remaining. The chief culprits were Tuncay, who skied a shot into the stands when unmarked eight yards out and, in the 63rd minute, Stewart Downing, who drilled a penalty - awarded for a trip by Seyi Olofinjana on Alves - against the bar.</p> <p>There was always a chance that such profligacy could come back to haunt Middlesbrough and, with 19 minutes remaining, Stoke equalised out of nothing when a low Liam Lawrence cross from the right found Dave Kitson. Despite being closely marshalled by Justin Hoyte, the former Reading striker managed to get a thigh on the ball to bundle it over the line for an unlikely equaliser that the defender got the last touch to.</p> <p>That looked to be that, especially with Middlesbrough continuing to misfire up front. Substitute Digard looked to have joined their hall of shame in the 85th minute with a grass-cutter bound for the advertising boards. However, the ball found its way through to Tuncay, onside and unmarked, and the Turkish striker buried his shot to send three-quarters of the Riverside into raptures.</p> <p>'I don't think we were at our best, but we still had the chances to have it sewn up,' said Southgate. 'If we had scored the penalty I think that would have killed it, but we've shown good character to keep plugging away and score two excellently taken goals that won us the tie.' </p> <p><strong>THE FANS' PLAYER RATINGS AND VERDICT</strong></p> <p><strong>Steve Goldby, <a href=\"http://www.comeonboro.com\">ComeOnBoro.com</a></strong></p> <p>I'm on a high after that match. Compared with the past two or three seasons, the entertainment value this year has gone through the roof. I don't know what Gareth Southgate did during the summer, but it worked - everyone is buzzing after the way we've started the season and if we hadn't lost late on at Liverpool we could have been top of the League. I think Southgate has finally got his own team - he had a vision when he took over as manager and he's welded together a side whose workrate is incredible. More importantly, Afonso Alves is our oldest player at 27. We used to have a reputation for signing cast-offs and has-beens, but not any more. If David Beckham had scored the free-kick Alves did, we would have been hearing about it all season. Alves, Tuncay and Mido were all outstanding.</p> <p><strong>The fans' player ratings</strong> Turnbull 7; Hoyte 6 (Taylor 6), Huth 7, Wheater 8, Pogatetz 8; Aliadi\u00e8re 8, O'Neil 7, Shawky 7 (Digard 7), Downing 7; Alves 9 (Mido 8), Tuncay 8</p> <p><strong>Dave Collins, Observer reader</strong></p> <p>Something of a heart-breaker, even if the result was a fair one. For a start, I'd like to see if Tuncay really was onside for the winner, though the radio said it was OK. Amdy Faye was foolish, though. That tackle would have meant a red card in the Championship, too, and we can't afford either to play with 10 men or to have someone suspended for three games. Whatever, we were that close to an away point against a team who have impressed this season. I don't know, maybe we stand a chance at Anfield if we can nearly hold a team who should have won there. Sorensen looks an excellent buy, as if he really has something to prove and not just against Villa. But the defence need to work on set pieces - that's another goal from a free-kick. Kitson hustled well for his goal, while Liam Lawrence impressed generally.</p> <p><strong>The fans' player ratings</strong> Sorensen 7; Griffin 6, Abdoulaye Faye 5, Dickinson 6 (Wilkinson 68), Cort 7; Lawrence 7, Olofinjana 6, Amdy Faye 3, Delap 4; Kitson 7 (Cresswell n/a), Fuller 6 (Sidibe n/a)</p> <p><strong><em>To take part in the Verdict, email fans@observer.co.uk</em></strong></p>",
  "<p>A clampdown on uninsured drivers to be launched this autumn could help cut premiums for other motorists, ministers will claim this week.</p> <p>Drivers who do not bother insuring their cars are known to be involved in more than 23,000 deaths and injuries on the roads every year, adding \u00a330 to the average premium for other road users. Yet until now they could only be prosecuted if police actually caught them in the act of driving.</p> <p>Ministers will this week unveil plans for a new offence of keeping a car uninsured, which will allow police to match insurance industry databases against DVLA records and identify cars which do not appear to be covered. The owners will receive warning letters and if they do not take out insurance will be fined \u00a3100 and may have their vehicles seized and crushed even if they have never left the garage.</p> <p>Jim Fitzpatrick, the road safety minister, will meet insurance industry representatives this week to discuss how the plans could be implemented. A Department for Transport official said that if the number of uninsured drivers was cut by a third it would save insurers \u00a3764m over five years which could then be used to keep premiums down. </p> <p>Ruth Kelly, the Transport Secretary, said she hoped that the proposals would reduce the misery and expense to other motorists. 'A small hard core of drivers who refuse to insure their cars push up premiums for responsible motorists and kill or injure thousands of people each year. We're determined to get these antisocial drivers off our roads,' Kelly declared. 'These tough new powers will leave uninsured drivers with nowhere to hide.' However critics will argue that the fine proposed under the new system is less than drivers could face if caught on the road and that cross-checking databases will not catch all offenders because its searches uncover whether specific vehicles are insured - they may not be insured for the driver at the wheel. </p> <p>Earlier this month Theresa Villiers, the Tory transport spokeswoman, accused the government of having 'repeatedly sent out the wrong message to irresponsible drivers who flout the law and dodge paying insurance' that they could get away with it.</p> <p>Around two million cars, or about 6 per cent of those on the road, are thought to be driven uninsured. Research suggests that these rogue drivers are 10 times more likely than ordinary motorists to be convicted of drink driving, six times more likely to drive a car that is unsafe and four times more likely to be convicted of driving without due care and attention. </p> <p>They are estimated to kill 160 people and injure 23,000 others every year. Many are driving vehicles that are not taxed or registered, or are themselves disqualified from driving.</p>",
  "<p>Jimmy Johnson, who served with the Royal Tank Regiment, was so affected by his experiences in Northern Ireland that he went on to commit murder.</p> <p>Jimmy Johnson served two tours of duty with the Royal Tank Regiment in Northern Ireland in the early Seventies. 'When I first took my section on a mobile patrol through this estate we loved it. We had never experienced anything like it before - the whole estate hated the Brits!' he recalled.</p> <p>Johnson's section gloried in the fighting and often, by their own admission, went 'looking for aggro'. But two incidents were to haunt him. In one a woman died of injuries suffered in a bomb explosion. Johnson refused to leave her because she reminded him of his wife, even though there were fears that another bomb was about to go off. The second incident occurred in the middle of a riot. Johnson chased a man into the kitchen of a house after he threw paint on him. He caught the man and beat him around the head with a rubber bullet gun. 'I couldn't stop. I was panicking and he wouldn't go down,' he said. </p> <p>Soon afterwards, Johnson bought himself out of the army but found he 'could not handle Civvy Street'. Suffering from nightmares and tension, he began to drink heavily. As he drifted from job to job his marriage disintegrated. One day, living near Middlesbrough, Johnson killed a security guard, who was a former workmate, after he offered him a lift. 'I've a vague recollection of kids playing on the side of the road. All I remember is a crash on the side of the van. I think the kids had thrown something at it.</p> <p>'The next thing I remember is running. I was carrying Keith [his victim]. I dropped him down, I battered him with a pole, I must have hit him three or four times.' Johnson said that when he carried out the attack he was 'thinking about hitting that bloke in Northern Ireland'. He served nine years in jail. Eighteen months after being released, he beat a man to death with a lump hammer, a crime for which he was sentenced to life. </p> <p>It was only after sharing a cell with a doctor who had killed his wife that Johnson first learnt about post-traumatic stress disorder. Dr Morgan O'Connell, a former consultant psychiatrist with the Royal Navy who examined Johnson, suggested he carried out both murders while 'in a state of detachment or flashback to conditions of severe stress while serving in Northern Ireland'. Johnson is still in jail.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Adapted from Hidden Wounds: Problems of Northern Ireland Veterans in Civvy Street, by Aly Renwick</p>",
  "<p>In that it is impossibly handsome, and in that it steadfastly, infuriatingly, refuses to be quite what we want it to be, this long-awaited book is that rare beast: an autobiography that absolutely mirrors its subject.</p> <p>After years of fraught negotiation, and courteous but unmistakably final fallings-out with two ghost-writers who wanted to clatter the pans by lifting too many lids on the broth of Connery's life, he went with an old friend, Scottish film-maker and polymath Murray Grigor. The result is safe but valiantly surprising, and deeply rewarding if you want to learn about being a Scot, and how that nation's thrawn, contradictory psyche was born from a savage, short, brilliant Enlightenment and a crushing postwar malaise. But it is deeply disappointing if you're just a Bond fan. Or a gossip fan. Or a film fan. Or even if you simply want to know what makes the big man tick.</p> <p>As he has always done, Connery calls the shots. He decided he didn't want to dish the dirt on himself or on anyone else. So there are precious few anecdotes and they're tantalisingly brief. It is a quite wilful swerve from what might have been expected: something about the women, about infidelity, perhaps more than one paragraph on the viciousness of the Scottish press. It's not that he doesn't mention the elephant in the room. He and Grigor simply don't acknowledge the possibility of elephants.</p> <p>Check the (sprawling, eclectic) index under T and you will find Turner. You might, legitimately, in Connery's only autobiography, expect at least a passing mention of 'Turner, Lana' and the impossibly other-age story of his on-set headbutting of feared Mafia hitman Johnny 'Stompy' Stompanato to defend her honour. Sadly, but not strangely, no. The only Turner mentioned is JMW and his early 'misty tartan proto-Impressionism'. Rather than a glorious Hollywood Babylon through the eyes of a former Fountainbridge milkman, what we get is a lecture: on art, architecture, history, music, drainage, cartooning.</p> <p>But that is not, astonishingly, to its discredit. He does it well. You can, among the sumptuous etchings and photos, begin to discern the key to the man and it is this: autodidacticism. He freely admits his jaunty early ignorance, his debt to near-forgotten directors who ordered him to pick up Turgenev, Proust, Joyce, Ibsen, Stanislavski (of course). Anecdotes attest to how ungladly he suffered his own foolishness: buying a reel-to-reel Grundig 'to hear how heavily accented my voice really was' or 'wondering how you could play an intelligent person if you were stupid and vice versa'.</p> <p>There is an old-Scottish voice, the tone of the dominie, to many of his enthusiastic lectures: a dislike of trends, buzz-words, fads; a reverence for achievement and discovery; precious little pause to reflect, forgive or wallow. Those who choose to carp may wonder whether the knowledge is all his own and certainly some of Scotland's finest artistic and historical minds are given end-page acknowledgments, but the slightly pedantic tone of the text reeks of the self-taught man, and one in fact who's still up to storming speed with the modern age, and the precise names behind his home country's skylines, theatres, newspapers. Privilege is not his favourite word. Rare opprobrium is reserved for Blair and Mandelson, as he casually reveals he still knows more about the formation of the party he admits he should by rights belong to - Labour - than do the usurpers. </p> <p>Even if you accept that this series of exuberant lectures is all you're going to get from Sean - and it is, in a phrase I'm sure he'd loathe, a big ask - there are a couple of problems. The book is strangely ill-served, given the brilliance of the rest of the design, by a back-page quote from John Huston that manages to both demean and vainglorify its subject: 'I wish for Chrissake that Sean Connery would become King of Scotland'. This will simply stir up those who want to mention Bahamian exile or who remember his infamous comments about slapping women (unmentioned here, although he has gone, if reluctantly, on the record and stood by them). </p> <p>A clearer timeline, and some simple context, would have made this an even better read. There is a lurch, as we move straight from his first, thrilling pay cheque for acting into lengthy chapters about Ossian and Macbeth, and he only reconnects with his film world in infuriatingly casual fits and starts. But there's no doubt that Sean Connery does know, still, what it means to be a Scot. To be able to douse the shortbread myths of what Tom Nairn has called 'kailyard sentimentality' means knowing them, and half-loving them, in the first place.</p> <p>He talks, at one stage, of a friend sending him a card with this seasonal inscription: 'In case you're having a merry Christmas, just remember where you came from.' Another very Scottish trait. I remember a fishwife in Aberdeen telling me why her lobsters needed no lid on the pan. 'They're all Scottish. One of them climbs near the top, the ithers'll pull him right back in.'</p> <p>Actually, Connery's biggest triumph may well be to remind many Scots where they come from. There'll be a lot of fathers this Christmas, bemusedly struggling - actually, wafting, for many of these pages do sing you along - through Tolstoy, curling, architecture, Ivor Cutler and the Mozart/Burns parallels, and the better they will be for it. Still. At one stage, before this gentleman leaves us, it would be good to get the full Lana Turner story.</p>",
  "<p>The uncertainty of the next America's Cup, locked as it is in the New York courts, took another twist last week with the launch of Larry Ellison's American challenger, and the enormity of the problem brought into sharp focus when a 100-foot long trimaran hit the waters off Anacortes in Washington State. </p> <p>This gigantic three-hulled vessel has a 158ft mast. Nothing like this has ever been seen before and its proportions would indicate that Ellison's BMW Oracle Racing team has covered all possible bases. The entire structure was completed in a specially built complex in order to control the temperature and humidity within fine limits. </p> <p>The trimaran was launched by Melinda Erkelens, appropriately the legal advisor of the Golden Gate Yacht Club through which Ellison's challenge was lodged, on 22 August, 157 years, exactly, after the original race around the Isle of Wight that began this competition. It marked the culmination of nine months' work by the 30-strong design team and a vast number of builders, involving a total of 80,000 man hours. </p> <p>Construction is principally in aerospace-quality carbon fibre, chosen for its high strength and lightness, and uses other materials more usually associated with this high-tech industry. </p> <p>Nothing has been left to chance in the design and construction of this boat and the sailing team is anxious to begin sailing trials. The 500 square-metre mainsail - more than twice the size of the ones used by the boats in the Cup races last year in Valencia - was due to be put aboard yesterday and hoisted for the first time today. It will be complemented by headsails of up to 350 square metres and asymmetric spinnakers of up to 700 square metres.</p> <p>Skipper Russell Coutts, whose team has been training in 40ft catamarans to obtain some idea of the characteristics of multihull racing, admitted to The Observer earlier this year the enormity of the problems and the difference between this and other racing. 'The loads on the hull and rig are massive,' he declared, 'and we will have to alter our complete sailing philosophy.' </p> <p>Coutts explained that whereas the practice of adding sail once the boat was going with the wind was the norm, it would not be so in the fresher breezes in the trimaran. 'We have found, by experience, that it is all too easy to capsize these boats - and that will extend to the big boat - by overpowering them. We will probably have to reduce sail once we have rounded the windward mark in order to survive when it blows.' Capsizing in the Cup races would be terminal to success. </p> <p>Jimmy Spithill, who will steer this monster, said: 'The first time you see it, it is a real shock. It's just so big.' Reminded that there was still doubt as to whether this boat would ever race in the America's Cup, if the court case went against BMW Oracle, he added: 'When you look at this boat you just think, \"Boy, who wouldn't want to see two of these boats race each other?\"' </p> <p>Sailing trials on Puget Sound are expected to begin on Monday.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on September 8 2008. In the article above we said the craft had 'a total downwind sail area of almost two football pitches'. The permissible length of a pitch is between 90m and 120m and the width between 45m and 90m. The area can therefore range between 4,050 and 12,000 square metres, yet the craft has a maximum total sail area of 1,550 square metres.</p>",
  "<p>A friend of mine wasn't sure what she wanted to do after finishing her master's degree. Her thesis was on Old Norse sagas; academia didn't appeal to her. At Oxford, like a lot of Americans abroad, she took to one of the local sports. In her case, the modern pentathlon. The next thing I heard she was training somewhere in Texas to make the US Olympic team. It seemed to me a lonely way of spending your mid-twenties. I saw her again at our five-year college reunion. Most of my classmates hadn't changed much. Some had wives, husbands, kids, a lot of money. We all wanted to show off what we had made of ourselves, but other evidence was hard to come by. She brought along her silver medal.</p> <p>I thought of her as I drove up to Aarhus, on a cold, overcast Monday morning, to meet the British handball team. I had heard the Danish town is very pretty, with waterfronts and parks and outdoor cafes. What I saw, driving through, were tall square Soviet-style apartment blocks only a little relieved by the bike racks built into the pavements outside them. My liaison was a woman named Lynn, one of the veteran players, who had given me directions. I was surprised that she kept referring to their training camp as a 'school'. I found it at last, set back from the main road and hidden by municipal trees. The sort of place usually described as a 'complex': a car park, verges of grass, a vague assortment of low buildings.</p> <p>Lynn had not used the wrong word. It turned out to be a kind of finishing school for sporty Danes. They could study badminton, volleyball, handball etc in their gap years, before taking up university or working life. The British Olympic team had installed themselves there from August to May, among the rest of the students, to practise handball. There are only one or two regulation courts permanently marked for handball in the whole of Britain; the school alone has four. Students lived in pairs in narrow dorms, their beds stretched head-to-head against one of the walls. They ate in the canteen: five meals a day, including elevenses and an afternoon snack. These were hungry kids: the kitchen had been set up to cater for the stomach cycle of a working athlete. But that is only part of the reason the British team had come to the school. Most of them were only just learning the game.</p> <p>I found two of them finishing lunch and watching TV in the common room. There was something familiar about the scene. I had spent a year playing basketball for a second-division club in Germany. What I recognised, in the half-light, was not just the institutional carpets, plastic tables and windowless hallways, but something about the passage of time: the waiting around, between a meal and a run. I introduced myself. One of the pair turned out to be the Lynn I had spoken to on the phone, a short cheerful blonde Scot, who told me briefly about herself - she had only an hour or so to eat, between training sessions.</p> <p>At 29, she is the oldest player on the women's team; she has been out in Aarhus already for 18 months. Lynn belongs to the minority of British players who grew up with handball: a sport that, for whatever reason, has a small following in her hometown of Cumbernauld, near Glasgow. She is married with no kids. I asked her what she wanted to do when the Olympics were over. (The 2012 Olympics, I should say, to which Britain, as the host nation, have an automatic entry - which is why the British Olympic Association are putting so much effort into preparing a team. They didn't qualify for this summer's Games.) Go back to her old job, she said, as a sports therapist. But then she corrected herself. Start a family, probably. By that point she will be 33 years old.</p> <p>Her husband had, until recently, been living with her at the school. I wondered at this a little - it seemed a great commitment - until I learnt that he had been with the men's team. But he missed the last cut and was sent home. Every six months they go through reselection. You mean, I said, that you have no guarantee of making the team, even if you stick it out here for four years? No, she said. And from time to time the pressure of the school got to be too much. She had found a Danish family in Aarhus from whom she could rent a room. She was moving out next week. </p> <p>After she left, the other player introduced himself. Stuart had the sort of comfortable strong bulk that you get from working and eating, not from drinking creatine and lifting weights. I'm writing about the handball team, I said. I've been describing it as a cross between basketball and football. More like rugby, was his answer - which was also the sport he had come from. It's rougher than football, and you get the same kind of passing as rugby. I hesitated over the next question. Why did you stop playing rugby? But he didn't mind answering it. Injuries were part of the story, but he had got fed up with his club. When Talent ID said they were looking for anyone over 190cm tall, he thought he'd give it a go. And here he was.</p> <p>Talent ID is a UK Sport initiative started in 2007 to bulk out the Olympic squad for the 2012 Games. Its 'Sporting Giants' programme (for people aged 16 to 25 and over 190cm with athletic skills) concentrates on handball, rowing and volleyball. Stuart had been 24 when he signed up. It seemed a wonderful thing to me, to offer yourself up and ask to be judged, according to weight and height and other less easily measured physical gifts, and put to use. This is what you can do, somebody had said to him: handball. </p> <p>I asked how long he had been playing. Eight months, he said. And then, the inevitable question: how far can you go in the Olympics? His reply had a physical force behind it, the confidence of big shoulders. They had a great group of guys. The amount they had improved, in such a short time, was unbelievable, and there were still four years to go. With the people he saw around him, he fully expected a medal. It struck me then that this was the answer he had to give, to do what he was doing, to be there, in the middle of a cold Monday morning. I couldn't begin to judge him until I saw him play. I know from experience that all athletes are, to a certain extent, delusional; it's just that some of them also happen to be right.</p> <p>What did his rugby mates think about handball? I said, to fill the silence.</p> <p>He let the muscles of his cheeks do the smiling for him. They thought it was a bit gay.</p> <p>And what did he think about that?</p> <p>Two words: professional athlete. 'I'm getting paid to do this. How many people can say that?'</p> <p>There was a game that night for the men's team, I learnt after lunch, and it had slightly unsettled their routine. The guys were both nervous and expectant. Matches allowed them to measure their progress with a little objectivity, which is also why they feared them: anything seems possible in the hothouse comfort of the practice gym.</p> <p>I spent a few minutes after lunch watching the women's team warm up. We were in the bowels of the complex, a large windowless hall with stadium seating running up the sides. The girls got loose by playing football - they were mostly girls, Lynn was an exception. The rest were 17, 18, 19: they had interrupted nothing more serious than a gap year or a university degree. I got a sense, for the first time, of what a lark it must seem to them. The ball bounced high on the wooden floor of the gym; they chased it in restless clusters. Nobody scored, which became a part of the joke. There they were, wearing the little nylon jerseys of PE class, and knocking a ball about.</p> <p>The men were getting ready next door, someone in goal, the rest hurling shots at him. I picked up a handball for the first time. They are filthy things, about the size of a volleyball, but heavier, and covered in something grey and tacky like the mess left behind by a peeled sticker. Tacky, in fact, is what they call it. It helps the ball stick, and they smear their hands with the stuff, when they run dry, from a jar which I found at the side of the court. I dipped two fingers in. It looked and felt like molasses. (A week later my hand broke out in small blisters: this, apparently, is one of the side-effects of playing.) The first thing you notice is how easy tacky makes it to catch a handball: it more or less sticks to your palm. The next thing you notice is how hard it is to throw. </p> <p>I hoped to get in on the practice and had a word with one of the coaches, Axel Norgaard - he looked up at me in stolid amusement. 'Ja, ja, no problem,' he said. 'In time.' He had the patient air of a man conducting an experiment; at least, he was happy to include me in it. I asked what his ambition for the Olympics was. A medal? Eighth place, he said (out of 12). I had not expected so specific an answer. He explained: into the second round. He is a square, short man with the slack wrinkled cheeks of a trumpet player; he has blown a lot of whistles. It struck me how little he had invested in the team. If they lost every game, no one could blame him. </p> <p>Handball is a physical sport. You are allowed to do more or less anything you like, another coach (there were a great many) explained, so long as you pull your man towards you. Pushing is the foul. The most spectacular act of handball is the shot. Attackers are not permitted to step foot inside the penalty box, but they can jump as close as they like and are taught to delay as long as possible in mid-air, to stretch out horizontally, to land flat. Delay is everything: once the goalie has committed himself, it is easy to slip the ball into the exposed corner. There are seven corners to shoot at around the keeper: left bottom, left middle, etc. Received wisdom states that even the best goalie - swinging his arms and legs like a marionette - can cover only six of them. </p> <p>After five minutes warming up with the team, I took myself aside and watched from the sideline. Simple drills: running two steps, leaping, throwing in mid-air. (Not as easy as it looks, it turns out.) Catching the ball overhead, passing it back. Standing over a team-mate and lifting him two-handed off the ground. I was already breathing painfully; my legs felt like stretched elastic. It had been 10 years since I belonged to any kind of a team, and what I felt suddenly was - my age.</p> <p>When I was younger, in shape, I could have done those things without breaking sweat. What I have become better at in the meantime is hard to measure. In most of the measurable qualities I have declined. One reason, maybe, these guys were doing what they were doing. The alternatives would leave them stuck at a desk somewhere, in a library cubicle, in an office - beginning the slow physical death of working life.</p> <p>They started playing. For the first few minutes I looked on nervously: I could not imagine taking my place in that chaos of legs and arms. I had forgotten how to stand up, physically, to the challenge of other men; I had forgotten how to take pleasure from it. Then Axel sent me in. My job was clear enough: to run like hell every time a shot was fired. 'Have you got a passport?' a few of them joked, shouting, as I broke up a long pass. And for a minute, almost, I could take the question seriously. This is the kind of thing I might have tried, when I was younger; I might have become an Olympian, if only through the back door. Soon, though, my mouth began to taste of blood, and I felt a familiar headache brewing, an echo in my ears. On the next long pass, I stumbled, catching up, and ended up on my back. </p> <p>I thought: I would never give up four years of my life for this. Even when I had the chance, to make a living off basketball, I did not last a season. I asked a few of the British players what they wanted to do with themselves after the Olympics. Mostly, they had a sensible answer: finish their degrees, become physical therapists, etc. If you could make a living from this game, I said, in some first-division club, in some small Danish town, would you? They all said yes. I looked around me. It was three in the afternoon and we were in a windowless gym in an Aarhus suburb. This was the quiet, dislocated, prolongation of childhood I had fled from.</p> <p>At the end of practice, I saw someone shooting handballs against one of the basketball hoops bolted into the wall of the court. Nice follow-through, clean rotation. I had a few hours to kill before supper at the canteen and figured I could soothe my ego a little by taking him on at basketball. Mark, the shooter, called out to a friend of his, a tall muscular Scotsman (named Scott), and we played for an hour.</p> <p>Mark and Scott had been picked out by Talent ID. Mark had played basketball since he was a boy and started for his university at Aberystywth, whose team reached the semi-finals of the British championship during his final year. Most of the guys I talked to had a story to tell about why they didn't make it in their first sport. Injuries at the wrong time. Bad luck at a tryout; the politics of team sports. Mostly injuries. Mark admitted that he just wasn't good enough. He had a beautiful shooting motion, good balance and ball control, and a steady head - I could see that from playing against him. But he was half a foot too short for the kind of athlete he was: he needed to be taller or much, much quicker. And what he wanted to do with his life was play ball.</p> <p>Scott had a slightly different story. At my height, six-and-a-half feet tall, he was at least 50 pounds of muscle stronger. He moved to Texas for his final year in high school, to play basketball, and ended up in athletics, too: he won the state championship in the hurdles. There was no question of his athleticism. Even so, the standards demanded by American basketball have become almost ridiculously high. He was never going to be one of those guys who could pick a coin off the top of the backboard, he said. A few division-two universities showed an interest; instead, he signed with Texas Tech to run track. Then he broke his leg. Tech, as he explained it, offered to pay for the surgery or his tuition, but not both, and he decided to go home. When Talent ID came calling, he was playing basketball for the University of Strathclyde.</p> <p>I asked them again how far they could go in the Olympics. Their answers were hopeful and vague, and it struck me that I should admit what I already planned to write: that only the less experienced players expected medals. The coaches, the old hands, just hoped to make it out of the group stage. They nodded, unsurprised, and dropped for a minute their veil of optimism. I guess you have to believe that you can win, one of them said. Mostly they were just trying to make it through the next round of selections. Coaches expected them to keep a diary of their progress. Work on the left hand. Get stronger on defence.</p> <p>A recent article in the Times had argued that UK Sport were wasting their money on games such as handball. Britain would never develop a handball culture and the \u00a33m earmarked for it could be better spent elsewhere. They had no chance of a medal. When Australia put together a team for the Sydney Games, they finished 11th out of 12, and now the purpose-built courts were running to waste. I asked if they had read it. Yes - Scott had taped a copy to his wall, to motivate him. It seemed to make them feel the privilege of their position. They had been given a second chance at a sporting career and they were grateful.</p> <p>Even so, they pointed out a fact that the article failed to mention. South Korea had started from scratch in the years leading up to Seoul. The women had won gold in 1988; the men silver. South Korea had since become one of the handball superpowers, because they had invested in the sport itself. Mark and Scott both claimed that their commitment to the programme included the role they hoped to play after the Olympics, in 'growing' the sport at the grassroots. Australia lost their nerve and brought in, at the last minute, a number of dual nationals to fill out the squad. There was no guarantee that Britain wouldn't do the same, but they had been given assurances.</p> <p>You mean, I said, that you could stick it out here for another four years and still get dropped?</p> <p>Yes.</p> <p>And you wouldn't regret it, I mean, the time spent over here, doing this?</p> <p>I'm not sure I trusted their responses, but a little later I got the sense of what an honest answer might look like. While we were eating afternoon tea, Angie from the women's team came over. Scott had broken the 'friendship bracelet' Angie had given him, and he asked her to tie it back on. They spent an awkward minute or two fidgeting over his wrist together, before she gave up and promised him to make it bigger.</p> <p>I'm holding you to that, he said.</p> <p>I felt like I was intruding on a high-school romance. Angie, after all, had just finished her A-levels. But professional athletes often skip some of the steps on the way to adulthood. It struck me that what I had stumbled upon was a scene from a certain kind of office life.</p> <p>Late afternoon. The sense of earned idleness, as the pleasant muscular fatigue of the morning work-out sets in. Food on tap; no need to buy it, nothing to wash up. The institutional comfort of a mealtime. The casual intimacies of like-minded people. Their physical similarities. Health, long limbs, good looks. Even the 'sports' complex architecture, the distance from home, the road passing by the school car park, contributed to the feeling of exemption from ordinary life. Nothing was expected of them beyond a few simple, easily measured tasks. Work on the left hand, get stronger on defence. Eat. Rest. </p> <p>I showered before supper, standing on dirty tiles. As I was dressing, a few men in civvies filed in with bags on their shoulders; they began to get changed. Are you students here? I asked. No, one of them said. He introduced himself: Martin. Very fair and handsome, a round red Danish face. We're the handball team. The opponents.</p> <p>One of the wonders of sports, I think, is the way talent hides itself in the human body. A short fat man may have quick feet and hands, a sharp eye; he may have been born with advantages as tangible and undeserved as wealth or good looks. But you won't know it till you see him play. I tried to judge the threat this bunch posed. A rag-tag group, they looked like a student union. In fact, when I asked him who they played for, Martin named a local university: they were the B team. In the world of club handball, this put them somewhere in the fifth division. Even so, we are not very good, he added. Their record for the season was something like four wins and 14 losses.</p> <p>Do you know who you are playing tonight? I asked.</p> <p>Yes. The British Olympic team.</p> <p>Let me know what you think of them, I said.</p> <p>Scott and Mark were anxious. The last time they had played was six weeks ago, when they lost badly to a third-division club. It was only a friendly, but they were preparing for a tournament in October, with other second-tier national teams; and their funding was up for review after that. A great deal depended on the next few months - which was just about as long as Mark and Scott had been playing the sport. Neither knew if the coach would give him a start that night, a small but important token of his confidence. For the most part, they were playing in the dark: they did not know what management thought of them; they did not know how good they could be. I was glad to see Mark on court when the whistle blew.</p> <p>Handball, it turns out, is not bad to watch. To an unfamiliar eye, the scoring lacks variety, but there is plenty of it and many of the games stay close. Mark was stuck on the wing, where he had little to do; it seemed to me the great weakness of the sport is its failure to involve everybody at once. The front-court players carry most of the load, passing and shooting. Britain, at least, had a very good point man, a kid called Chris, who had grown up in Germany, a big steak-eating kind of a kid, with the baby-fat of muscular youth still on his cheeks. He powered his way through the defence and scored almost at will. The difference between him and the rest was obvious and made me realise the uphill battle faced by most. Chris had played all his life and it showed; I learnt later that he had made the B side of the German youth team. </p> <p>But the Danes kept pace. They had a squat, awkward inside man, who could turn on a sixpence and deliver the ball from almost any angle. The scores were level at half-time. After the break, the coach sent Stuart on, to contain the Danish threat. Stuart was the kind of athlete I hated to play against: a bully and a team man. He liked throwing his weight around. You got the sense that sport to him was a contest between the nobility of strength and the deceitfulness of skill. Well, the ref called a few fouls on him, then got tired of calling fouls and sent him off. Stuart could not believe it. He stood motionless with anger, just brushing off the few team-mates who tried to take him by the arm. And I remember thinking that the question I had asked at the beginning of this piece had had an answer: how much could I trust his self-confidence?</p> <p>The Danes pulled ahead and I was beginning to worry that the tide had turned when Mark caught a long ball on the break and flew in from the side to even the score. A minute later, he scored again. The niceness or fineness of technique that I had seen in his basketball stroke had found its expression here and I saw him afterwards, as he made his way back on defence, clench and unclench his fist: the gesture, familiar to me, of a kid quietly internalising a moment of success, counting his points. Yes, I can do it. Then the fitness of the British team began to tell and they held on, through the dying minutes, for a narrow win.</p> <p>I wondered how much of what they felt was relief, how much joy, but it seemed impossible to tell the difference. The women's team clustered around. A little bit better, Angie said to Scott, holding up two fingers in the air, a small way apart. You played a little bit better; and it was an ordinary Monday evening again, with time to kill before bed. Some of the veterans who had not played began to fool around in front of net, until the coach pushed a trolley of balls down the centre of the court and told them to clean up. </p> <p>I found Martin, even redder in the face than before, following his team out the door, and asked him what he thought.</p> <p>They have nothing to do with the Olympics, he said, more breathless than angry. </p> <p>I said, some of them have only been playing eight months. </p> <p>Well - but he had nothing to add.</p> <p>Axel was decently satisfied with the performance. I said, how can they hope to compete in the Olympics, when they can hardly beat a fifth-division Danish team? </p> <p>You must remember, of course, he said, their inexperience. It is remarkable, how far they have come. </p> <p>But you don't think they can win a medal?</p> <p>Of course (it was a part of his front, as a coach, a thick veneer of the obvious), they have a lot to learn from us still. But I think that the Danes also have something to learn from the British. When they set their minds to something, they do it.</p> <p>It was the note, I suppose, he wanted me to leave on. But what I thought about on the long drive home was something else. I remembered from my playing days the way each defeat positions you in the ranks of failure. It teaches you to recognise your level. But a win, no matter how narrow, leaves you a little room to hope. If I beat those guys, maybe I can beat the next lot, too, and if I beat them, who knows? Most of the players on the British team had already failed at something, at the games of their youth: they had reached those limits that sport makes painfully clear. This must be part of what draws them to Denmark and their strange life here. That they can ask themselves, as if for the first time, the childish question: I wonder how good I can be? </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Editor's note: Since this article was completed, Scott and Stuart are no longer part of the British handball team</p> <h2>Handball for beginners (including the GB squad) </h2> <p><strong>What are the rules?</strong></p> <p>Invented in Denmark in the late 19th century, handball is played with a team of six court players and a goalkeeper. Court players may run with the ball while bouncing it, but it must not touch their body below the knees; goalkeepers can stop shots with any part of their anatomy. To score, the player must throw the ball from outside the D-shaped goal area into the goal. Games last an hour and often feature 50 or 60 goals.</p> <p><strong>Why is it always on TV in Europe?</strong></p> <p>Handball has a huge following: the 2007 men's world championship final between Germany and Poland drew a global live audience of 23 million (more than the last day of the US Masters or the Wimbledon men's singles final). In Germany, attendances of more than 20,000 are common, while in Denmark the sport is arguably more popular than football, with one court for every 5,000 people. There's even a Handball Manager computer game.</p> <p><strong>Who are the sport's biggest stars?</strong></p> <p>Nikola Karabatic, a French international of Croatian extraction known as 'The Machine', has been dubbed 'the world's most complete player'. In the women's game, Grit Jurack of Germany has superb all-round skills. </p> <p><strong>How are Britain doing?</strong></p> <p>Until 2005, there was not even a GB team. In one early match, Britain lost by 30 goals to the Faroe Islands. Their progress will be shown when the women play in the Four Nations in Sheffield from 16-18 October; around the same time, the men travel to Oman. There are also now English leagues, with teams divided into North and South.</p> <p><strong>Could I make the team in 2012?</strong></p> <p>Height and athleticism are important. A certain amount of bravery is also useful, especially if you are playing in goal, where shots can travel towards you at more than 60 miles per hour. <br><strong>Charlie Douglas-Hughes</strong></p> <h2>London 2012: Another new ball game </h2> <p>Our handballers are not the only British team shooting for 2012 glory in a foreign country. Thanks to the new men's coach - Harry Brokking, who was previously in charge of Holland's national team - the British volleyball squad have been competing in the Dutch league. They took the place of Martinus, who, after struggling to find sponsorship for the 2007-08 season, agreed to let the British men play in their place. </p> <p>The exchange has not been an unqualified success. The decision was met with initial trepidation by Martinus's fans and when the season ended back in April the Brits had won just three games and suffered 25 defeats. Despite being backed by \u00a34m in funding, they finished last in the league.</p> <p>As with handball, the team is inexperienced and struggled against opponents desperate to 'put one over' the Brits. 'No one feels sorry for us, believe me - it's like a cup final every week,' says British captain Ben Pipes. Brokking is keen to take the positives from a character-building year. 'It's frustrating but to be expected, given the level at which they started,' he says. 'Inevitably, they are behind skills-wise, but this is a long-term project and they are making progress.' Indeed their progress is evident after the most recent international result - a 3-0 win over Egypt in Sheffield.<br><strong>CD-H </strong></p>",
  "<p>Darren Gough has always seemed to fit various decades-old stereotypes. The bumpkin fast bowler with a big heart and an even bigger backside. The bluff Yorkshireman happy to sing his own praises. And, of course, the travelling showman. From the moment that Gough first walked out on to a cricket pitch for England in 1994, he has been an entertainer. Throughout the 1990s - a time when Ian Botham had already passed into legend, and before Andrew Flintoff existed in the national consciousness - he was the all-rounder who made your heart leap when he marked out his run-up, or strode to the middle.</p> <p>Gough was England's first-choice strike bowler and more: he provided the effervescent spirit and fun that stopped the team becoming too dour under Mike Atherton, or too intense under Nasser Hussain. It was Gough's ebullient presence that seemed to promise the hope of victory, even when the form sheet said that England would lose. No one has come close to threatening his England record of 235 one-day wickets (taken at a miserly average of 26.42). And despite retiring from international cricket in 2006 - his England career effectively ended three years earlier by repeated injury to his right knee - he has remained one of the most popular players in the country, whether bowling for Essex or Yorkshire, or nailing a paso doble on Strictly Come Dancing.</p> <p>At 37, Gough has decided that 2008 will be his last season. Fast bowlers are used to pain, but the constant straining on his back and pounding on his knees have become unsustainable. 'I don't want to push my body to the limit any more,' he says when we first hook up at Headingley, one of a series of meetings through his last year as Yorkshire's county captain.</p> <p>Before he leaves at the end of this month, there is a championship season to save - with only four matches left, Yorkshire are still in danger of relegation - not to mention various parties to send him off. Nor will this be the last we see of him. A TV career beckons starting, this month, with a bizarre Japanese game show on Saturday-evening prime time, which promises to reveal Gough as we have never seen him before.</p> <p>There is a pre-season smell of turf and sweating tarpaulins when I first visit Gough in early April. The Headingley Carnegie ground is thrumming to the noise of a generator as men jet-spray the concrete stands to remove six months of accumulated grime. From the middle, where Yorkshire's practice is under way, comes the sporadic yell of ''Eds-'eds-'eds!' as someone blasts a ball out of the nets. Someone is facing away, doing the unmistakable jiggle of a man fitting his box: the square, solid torso confirms that it is Gough.</p> <p>In some people's hands, a cricket bat can resemble a wand; in Gough's it has always looked like a flyswat. He does not bat for long; he has an appointment to hand over a cheque to the air ambulance and he drives me to the airport in his chunky 4x4 (that physique would, frankly, look ridiculous in anything else). This morning, he tells me, he did a Myers-Briggs personality test; he won't find out until tomorrow whether he is, officially, an introvert or an extrovert. I propose that the answer is fairly obvious. Gough shakes his head. 'I'd say I'll be borderline. Ninety per cent of the public would say I'm extrovert, but I'm not like everybody thinks.'</p> <p>The public would, however, have a damn good argument. This is the man who, aged 23, strutted into the international arena as if it had been built for him; who puffed his chest out so far in the field it seemed it might explode; who stuck his tongue out at batsmen mid-delivery. This is also the man who chose, as his winter training this year, to tour the UK in a stage version of BBC1's Strictly Come Dancing. Who 'has always been the centre of attention, always been called the talisman, the person that lifts people around him'. Those, of course, are his own words.</p> <p>Gough talks about himself without the usual inhibitions of public modesty. In others, it would be arrogance; in Gough, it is an almost child-like honesty. Take his view of the Strictly tour: 'the judges were amazed how good I still was' - or its contestants - 'I'm almost like a father figure to them.' He is equally proud of his children (he tells me that on their first skiing trip an instructor asked how many years they had been practising).</p> <p>Yet in the car, with an audience of one, he is relaxed and easy to talk to - when he is not performing, Gough can be quiet, even shy. 'I wouldn't have been the cricketer I've been if I hadn't had that talent to be two people,' he says. 'I probably taught myself to be like that over the years.'</p> <p>Kids love his energy and sense of mischief; women like the strong arms and cheeky smile. Ultimately, however, Gough is a bloke's bloke, most at home with the lads - whether they are his team-mates, the old schoolfriends who stay at his Yorkshire house whenever he is playing a home game, or the air ambulance crew, with whom he has an instant rapport. One of them picked up Richard Hammond after his land-speed record attempt. 'When I saw the words \"300mph crash\" on the call sheet, I thought someone was taking the piss,' he confides to Gough. 'I was saying to myself, \"Just don't let him die in our helicopter.\"'</p> <p>Gough knows a fair amount about helicopters: he is flown, most weeks, up to Headingley from his home near Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire. It is an unusually glamorous entrance for a county cricketer, and the result of the geographical upheaval caused in his life when he split up from his wife, Anna, six years ago.</p> <p>Distance was what broke the marriage - the hundreds of miles between them during a busy county season, and the thousands when he was on winter tours with England. 'They didn't really look after families when I played,' Gough says, with a hint of annoyance. 'Now they fly them business class, they get looked after like they should do. When we played it was a case of they got in the way.' After two years with Essex, to be nearer his two boys, Liam and Brennan, Gough has returned to Yorkshire. And, as it happens, to Anna.</p> <p>At the start of July, Gough gives his team-mate Azeem Rafiq, a 17-year-old off-spinner, a lift to Yorkshire's Twenty20 quarter-final away to Durham. He has a particular reason to feel affection for the lad - like Gough himself, Rafiq is from Barnsley, though born in Pakistan.</p> <p>The team arrive at the ground, unpack their gear, start to warm up. Half an hour before the game is due to begin, the Durham chairman appears at the dressing-room door and tells Gough the match has been called off. Yorkshire are under investigation, he says, for fielding a non-registered player in one of their earlier group games: Azeem Rafiq. The chairman asks if Gough's team will play a friendly instead. 'Play a friendly?' Gough scoffs. 'No chance.' In the dressing room, the players are shocked and despondent - they hear rumours that they could be thrown out of the tournament.</p> <p>A few weeks later, Gough is in another dressing room. Here, the spirit is high; the teams are mixing freely; there is not a jockstrap in sight. There is, however, a large quantity of foundation, concealer and mascara laid out, and some of it is being applied to Gough's face. He is back in the bowels of the BBC's Television Centre, having been asked to captain one of the teams in their new Saturday-night game show, Hole in the Wall.</p> <p>By now, Yorkshire have indeed been kicked out of the Twenty20 Cup; an inadvertent administrative mistake has cost the players their shot at glory - and a chance of a place at the \u00a32.5m Champions League tournament on offer to the finalists. For Gough, at least, there is this silver lining. When the BBC had approached him about the show, Yorkshire were still in the competition, and the week of shooting clashed with its scheduled climax. 'We kept it quiet,' Gough says, 'because if we'd got to the finals day it would have been impossible to do.'</p> <p>But now he is here, amid a chaos of celebrity. Vanessa Feltz, one of the contestants, is being made up in the chair beside him. DJ Spoony walks in and out, cracking gags. And Gough's rival captain, Anton du Beke - the professional dancer who made the leap from Strictly into a presenting career - bounces about the room, flexing his pecs, singing, and waltzing with any female who strays into his reach. Among these practised TV types, Gough is subdued, no longer the loudest personality in the room.</p> <p>The show has been bought in from Japan and makes Banzai look comparatively sane. It is not what you would call high-concept. Teams take it in turn to face a moving wall with a cut-out shape in it; if they make the shape, they pass through, if they get it wrong, they are knocked into a pool. Having signed up Dale Winton to present and Du Beke as a team captain, they needed to balance the tone. Or, as Gough puts it: 'They wanted someone who was butch and they went for me.'</p> <p>Not even Gough's machismo, however, can counteract the camp of the silver Lycra wet suits that all contestants are forcibly squeezed into. There are a couple hanging in the corner of the room; they look like novelty condoms. 'Anton looks like a stick in his,' Gough says. What do you look like, I ask? 'More like a branch.' </p> <p>'A branch of Woolworths,' Feltz snorts.</p> <p>She is not wrong. Gough is whooped on to the stage half an hour later by the studio audience and there is no denying it - his stocky frame looks huge. But if he is embarrassed, it does not show. Gough's limitless enthusiasm and total absence of irony are perfect for light entertainment, and he proves adept at the cheerful mute show the cameras require. In between takes, he chatters with his team-mates, Spoony and Vic Reeves's wife, Nancy Sorrell. They are fond of him already.</p> <p>I tell him, afterwards, that he looked like he was genuinely enjoying himself, not just playacting. 'Yeah, I think it's a fun show to do,' he says earnestly. 'Once you've got used to the outfits.' It is, surely, the silliest thing he's ever had to do? He frowns slightly. 'Yeah, but I think it'll be a massive show, and people will watch it. It's up against X-Factor, after all. Families will love it, I know mine will, and I think we'll do another series.'</p> <p>The Roses match in mid-August - the County Championship derby between Lancashire and Yorkshire - ends in a draw. It might have been a Yorkshire win, if the game had not begun under a slew of Manchester rain. As it is, Gough is satisfied and relieved. In June, his team were leading Division One of the championship; since they were booted out of the Twenty20, their results have been dire. A draw, as they say, is a positive result.</p> <p>The next week, Gough is driven to a London studio for a day of filming and voice-over work. He is putting his name to one of those sporting-blooper-reel DVDs that feed a seemingly insatiable Christmas market, the kind that Phil Tufnell knocks out by the dozen, wheezy commentary and all. I want to tell Goughie that he is better than that; that a three-time Strictly winner cannot possibly need this kind of remainder-bin exposure. Instead, I ask him what's gone wrong with Yorkshire.</p> <p>'Ever since the Twenty20 fiasco it's been really, really hard work,' he admits. 'To say it's not affected the players is a lie. It's gone a bit wobbly.' He had always planned, he said, to step back from the four-day team and try out some younger players. 'But the last three games I didn't play we lost all three, quite comfortably. In the two games I've played we've got winning draws, so it kind of says we do better with me in the side. I didn't actually realise the impact I had. Other people had to tell me. If you've got Darren Gough on your team sheet it makes a big mental difference.'</p> <p>There is a bitter irony that Twenty20 - the fast-paced, family-friendly version of the game - should be taking off just as Gough is ending his career. Gough is made for it: his much admired bowling 'at the death', his musketeer batting, but, mostly, his irrepressible sense of fun. 'It's a pity it weren't around 15 years ago,' he says.</p> <p>He has had approaches from other counties, asking him to play one-day cricket next year, and while he is not interested in a full season, he thinks he may manage some Twenty20 - maybe even the Indian Premier League. 'I know I'm still one of the best one-day cricketers around, there's no doubt in my mind about that, and you speak to my coaches they all say that as well.'</p> <p>It is classic Gough: unaffected, and uncontainable. At the time of writing, he is in the top half of the limited-overs averages, with a bowling average of 21.62 from 11 matches. 'In the semi-final I were bowling at 80 to 90 miles an hour. I still believe I could perform at any level - I even believe I could perform at the highest level now.'</p> <p>As in, for England? 'At the highest level.' I wonder if someone should tell the selectors. 'Oh no, there's no way I'd play now, even if... If it was a one-off game, yes, course I would.' Could he be thinking of Sir Allen Stanford, and that million-dollar jackpot the American has put up for a match between England and his West Indies All Stars? Gough does later drop into conversation that he will be in Antigua at the time of November's game, having been invited to play some beach cricket with other former England players, including Phil DeFreitas and Allan Lamb. And he is, of course, good friends with the new England captain Kevin Pietersen (Gough was best man at his wedding to Jessica Taylor in December). They spent an evening together last week, with 'a bottle of vodka and a bottle of champers'. 'We talk a lot,' Gough says. 'And I can keep his feet on the ground.'</p> <p>He is envious of the current England players. 'I think they've got it easy,' he says. 'Playing for England now is a breeze. It's financially rewarding, they don't play as much, they fly upper deck in Virgin. Even on their appearance days they can get up to five or six grand. There's nothing for them to grumble about. It's a great life. It was a great life I had, and it's even greater now.'</p> <p>Gough's own days of leisure are almost upon him. Come the end of the season, he has promised himself 'at least four months of doing very little', including that jaunt to Antigua and a skiing trip with his family. Then, he hopes, a life in TV: 'But a lot of people want to do that and it's a hard market to get into, so we'll have to wait and see.' Just one thing: no more dancing. 'I've won that show three times: more than anyone else has ever won it,' he says proudly. 'There's no point spoiling it.' </p> <h2>Darren Gough: A life in wickets</h2> <p><strong>1988</strong></p> <p>A promising footballer, Gough - born in Barnsley - starts at Rotherham FC on a government training scheme, but chooses cricket when offered a contract by Yorkshire CCC. </p> <p><strong>1994</strong></p> <p>Scores a half-century and takes six wickets on Test debut against New Zealand at Old Trafford, in a comfortable England victory.

  "<p>A cussed refusal to accept that his opponent was playing the better tennis enabled Andy Murray to claw his way into the fourth round of the US Open - coming back from two sets down for the second time in consecutive grand slams. </p> <p>Murray ended up beating J\u00fcrgen Melzer of Austria 6-7 4-6 7-6 6-1 6-3 in a marathon that lasted lasted 3 hours 52 minutes. Despite the fact that Murray had two set points at 6-5 in the first set and missed four break-point opportunities in the second, it was Melzer who was stealing the show with his superb, swinging left-handed serves out to Murray's backhand and some deft dropshots, taken right out of Andy's playbook. </p> <p>Murray had recovered from a similar deficit against Frenchman Richard Gasquet on Wimbledon's Centre Court, but this contest was very different in atmosphere and location, as well as the standard of tennis played. The fact that the British No 1 was playing an aggressive left-hander on the Grandstand court just two days after he had struggled to beat Michael Llodra in that same arena hardly boded well - especially as the absence of Hawkeye on the court would mean that the players were at the mercy of the US Open's third-string line judges. </p> <p>And, of course, Melzer proceeded to hit more lines in the first three sets than anyone I can remember. Serves and passing shots clipped not merely the line but the very edge of the line so frequently that Murray was left shaking his head in despair. A year ago, it might have driven the young Scot over the brink and sent him screaming into the arms of his former coach Brad Gilbert. But he has learned to deal with life's vicissitudes a little better now and refused to get too distracted. </p> <p>In between brilliant shotmaking, there was some chaotic tennis from both men, especially Melzer whose all-or-nothing style meant that numerous balls were shanked to the far corners of the court. But when it came to crunch time in the first-set tie-break, he kept coming back at Murray - following a terrible forehand with a great dropshot to level at 4-4 and then producing another unbelievable dropshot to clinch it 7-5. Equally amazingly, eight of the 12 points in the breaker had gone against serve. </p> <p>Murray was still off his game at crucial moments of the second set and when he was forced into error on the volley on set point, the odds on a comeback looked slim. One could not help remembering Melzer's performance against Tim Henman in Miami in 2004 when the Austrian, who had never been ranked above 60 at the time, produced a dazzling performance to stun the then British No 1. </p> <p>But Murray is a fighter - a greater fighter than he is given credit for - and, despite the heat and all the other frustrations, he kept nibbling away until he finally broke for the first time in the fifth game of the third set. But Melzer is equally obdurate and broke back for 5-5 to ensure another tie-break. This time Murray shrugged off the loss of a 4-2 lead and took himself to set point with one of the 18 aces he produced during a generally spotty serving performance. </p> <p>Having battled back into contention, it was hardly surprising that Melzer went into temporary meltdown in the fourth and he needed some lengthy treatment on aching thigh muscles before he could start the fifth. It was an ironic sight - the battle-hardened 27-year-old Austrian needing medical assistance while Murray wandered around, impatiently swishing his racket. What odds on that being the case 18 months ago when his critics were still calling Murray frail and unfit? </p> <p>But Murray has proved a lot of things in the past few months and is now capable of winning whether he is playing well or not so well - the hallmark of a prospective champion. Not here this year, perhaps, but the steel he showed in repelling Melzer's last lunge for glory in the fifth showed just what kind of competitor he is. </p> <p>The match of the championships so far ended at 1.35 am on Saturday morning with Andy Roddick, backed all the way by a well-fuelled New York crowd, wondering just how he had managed to quell the incredible skills of Ernests Gulbis, who had led the former US Open champion 6-3 5-3 before losing control of the match. </p> <p>Roddick, powering in huge serves, covering acres of the Arthur Ashe Stadium with giant strides and pummelling forehands, somehow managed to push Gulbis back on his heels and come through to win 3-6 7-5 6-2 7-5. </p> <p>Roddick was full of praise for his Latvian opponent, with whom he shared a birthday that very evening. When midnight struck Roddick turned 26 and Gulbis 20. The loser deserved a better birthday present because, as Roddick said: 'When he steps up and is hitting his shots, he hits so hard, there's not a lot you can do. He just cracks the ball.' </p> <p>What Gulbis also does is use his marvellous hands to conjure up dropshots out of nowhere. The young man, who used to be flown to ATP Challenger events in his father's private jet, is a fabulous talent who will climb rapidly up the rankings. But for Roddick this was a massively important victory. He carries the hopes of American tennis heavily on his shoulders and he desperately needed this kind of confidence boost.</p>",
  "<p>Twenty years ago, as the Berlin Wall fell, people assumed the end of hostility between East and West, and a new world order founded on common values. As part of this, 10 Eastern European states joined Nato and intensified co-operation with Europe and more wanted to follow. But Russia's hostile action towards Georgia suggests that they are unreconciled to this new reality. Their aggression raises two urgent questions for us: how best to stabilise Georgia now, and how to make it clear to Russia that its unilateral approach is dangerous and unacceptable. War in Georgia also poses a serious longer term issue - how can we best create a rules-based international system that protects our collective security and safeguards our shared values?</p> <p>At tomorrow's European summit in Brussels we will first unite to alleviate the suffering of the 100,000 Georgian civilians left without homes. The UK has already pledged \u00a32m, and I will urge partners to meet not only Georgia's immediate needs but its long-term reconstruction and development needs. We will deploy peace monitors to better judge violations of the ceasefire, appoint a senior figure to drive the humanitarian and political effort, and support the Nato Georgia Commission, with a Nato team sent to Georgia.</p> <p>Georgia has felt the consequences of the conflict. It is important that the summit also demonstrates to Russia that its actions have real consequences.</p> <p>No one wants a new Cold War or the encirclement of Russia. But when I spoke to President Medvedev yesterday, I told him to expect a determined European response. As David Miliband has said, there can be no return to 'business as usual' unless and until Russia commits fully to Georgia's territorial integrity and withdraws to its previous positions.</p> <p>Russia has emerged as a significant economic power, with its trade increasing fourfold. It has done so by reaping the benefits of a stable global order based on agreements that make trade and investment both possible and profitable, bringing greater stability and certainty to international relations. Equally, when Russia fights secessionist movements in Chechnya or Dagestan, it expects others to respect its territorial integrity and not to recognise declarations of independence.</p> <p>So when Russia has a grievance over an issue such as South Ossetia, it should act multilaterally by consent rather than unilaterally by force. I believe Russia faces a choice about the nature of its responsibilities as a leading and respected member of the international community. My message to Russia is simple: if you want to be welcome at the top table of organisations such as the G8, OECD and WTO, you must accept that with rights come responsibilities. We want Russia to be a good partner in the G8 and other organisations, but it cannot pick and choose which rules to adhere to.</p> <p>That is why I will argue tomorrow that Russia should accept Georgia's territorial integrity and international mechanisms for addressing these conflicts, and withdraw troops to their previous positions. And, in the light of Russian actions, the EU should review - root and branch - our relationship with Russia. We should continue to strengthen the transatlantic relationship and may need to meet more regularly as the G7. We are also reflecting on the Nato response. We must re-evaluate the alliance's relationship with Russia, and intensify our support to Georgia and others who may face Russian aggression .</p> <p>No nation can be allowed to exert an energy stranglehold over Europe and the events of August have shown the critical importance of diversifying our energy supply. The tenfold increase in the world oil price in the past decade has demonstrated that diversification from oil is also an economic necessity. The UK will go from being 80 per cent self-sufficient now to having to import almost two-thirds of our gas and more than half of our oil by 2020 - precisely as markets become more volatile as more people chase fewer natural resources. And with states such as Russia increasingly using their energy resources as policy tools it is apparent that the security grounds for this shift are stronger as well.</p> <p>Without urgent action we risk sleepwalking into an energy dependence on less stable or reliable partners. That is why we in the UK are putting in law our commitment to cut CO2 emissions by 60 per cent by 2050, looking to replace our ageing nuclear power plants, to encourage greener fuels to power our homes and businesses and to transform the way we travel. Europe also needs to take action. Tomorrow's summit must add urgency to the work on Europe's energy agenda. We must more rapidly build relationships with other producers of oil and gas. Our response must include a redoubling of our efforts to complete a single market in gas and electricity, a collective defence to secure our energy supplies.</p> <p>I will also be pressing European leaders to increase funding for a project to allow us to source energy from the Caspian Sea, reducing our dependence on Russia. I will encourage European partners to use our collective bargaining power rather than seek separate energy deals with Russia. And because the environmental necessity is urgent, we must deliver an ambitious 2020 climate and energy package by the end of this year. </p> <p>More than 10 years ago Alexander Solzhenitsyn - who died just days before this latest chapter in the history of his country - wrote: 'We were recently entertained by a naive fable of the happy arrival of the end of history, of the overflowing triumph of an all-democratic bliss; the ultimate global arrangement had supposedly been attained. But we all see and sense that something very different is coming, something new, and perhaps quite stern. No, tranquillity does not promise to descend on our planet, and will not be granted us so easily.' The past few days have seen some of his predictions realised. </p> <p>This is why the changing global order cannot be governed by institutions designed in the middle of the last century. We now know how much more we have to do to create an effective system of international rules. We must strengthen the system of global governance to meet the challenges of our interdependent world. We must reshape our global architecture to meet the new challenges: climate change, energy security, poverty, migration. And in doing so we must stand up for both our vital interests and our essential values.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Sunday August 31 2008. </p>",
  "<p>For a few moments, the exuberant crowd at the Democratic convention this week fell silent. In sombre tones, Barack Obama's running mate, Joe Biden, described his regular evening commute by Amtrak train from Washington to his blue-collar home town of Wilmington, Delaware.</p> <p>'As I look out the window at the homes we pass, I can almost hear what they're talking about at the kitchen table after they put the kids to bed,' Biden told his audience in Denver. 'Questions they never thought they would have to ask.'</p> <p>He rattled off a list of America's economic woes: the soaring price of a tank of petrol, rocketing heating bills with winter around the corner, surging healthcare costs, job cuts and wage restraint. </p> <p>At the centre of it all, he said, kitchen-table worries revolved around the subprime mortgage crisis: 'Now we owe more on the house than it's worth. How are we going to send the kids to college?'</p> <p>With just over nine weeks until the presidential election, the crisis gripping America's economy has emerged as the most important issue on voters' minds. Some 61 per cent of the electorate cite economic concerns as the biggest problem facing the nation - almost double the 34 per cent recorded in January, according to the Pew Research Centre. Only 17 per cent cite Iraq as their greatest worry.</p> <p>For all the bluster about hope, renewal, wartime heroism and leadership, the policy battle is shaping up to be a classic confrontation of liberal versus conservative ideology. While Obama wants to tax the rich and channel aid to the poor, John McCain is explicitly pledging smaller government, balanced budgets and an extension of the Bush era of low taxation. It is a bottom-up philosophy against a trickle-down approach.</p> <p>'The economic news is going to be pretty much bad from here through till November,' says Dean Baker, co-director of the Centre for Economic and Policy Research in Washington. 'The economy is going to be front and centre.'</p> <p>While past presidential candidates have had the luxury of theorising over future policies, Obama and McCain face a crucial issue they can't duck: what to do about Bush's $2 trillion in temporary tax cuts, skewed towards the wealthy, which expire in 2010. While Obama would partially roll them back, McCain intends to make them permanent. 'The choice is stark and simple,' McCain told a recent town hall meeting in Colorado. 'Senator Obama will raise your taxes. I won't. I will cut them where I can.'</p> <p>Obama intends to increase rates for those with incomes over $250,000 - a mere 3 per cent of the population, his team says - to raise perhaps $700bn over a decade. McCain, meanwhile, presents himself as a paragon of fiscal virtue who will balance the budget by 2013.</p> <p>That's all very well. But experts point out that more immediate problems face the US as the credit crunch wreaks havoc with the financial system.</p> <p>'We're going to see more bank failures,' says Baker. 'They're going to have to decide whether to keep [lenders] Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as private companies. There's going to have to be more bank regulation. There are going to be a lot of big challenges to address.'</p> <p>The Bush administration has already tried throwing money at the economy to force it back on track through a $168bn stimulus package, which involved sending out tax rebate cheques of up to $600 per person. Obama wants to have another crack through a second injection of $50bn, combining a fresh round of rebates with a fund to prevent home foreclosures.</p> <p>'An extra $50bn in people's pockets would get us back to that sweet spot,' says Brad DeLong, an economics professor at Berkeley University in California who served in the Treasury during the Clinton years. 'It would keep employment sufficiently high but avoid an inflationary spiral.'</p> <p>DeLong, who is an Obama backer, says McCain takes the opposite view: 'He thinks not recognising the problem is the right thing to do. He's opposed to giveaways. He thinks these difficulties are down to feckless borrowers who took out huge loans and spent the money on holidays to Bali.'</p> <p>Both candidates have surrounded themselves with heavyweight economic brains, some of whom arrive with baggage. Obama rankled unions by recruiting a centrist, Jason Furman, as his economic policy director. Furman, who is close to the Clinton-era Treasury secretary Robert Rubin, is pro-trade, and annoyed left-wingers in 2005 by presenting a paper lauding Wal-Mart as 'a progressive success story'. </p> <p>Meanwhile, McCain has turned to Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office who has advised both Bush Presidents. Standing behind him are two Silicon Valley stars - the former Hewlett-Packard boss Carly Fiorina and retired eBay chief executive Meg Whitman.</p> <p>Some of the most bitter exchanges between the two camps have been about how to deal with rocketing fuel prices. To many non-partisan economists, this has exposed politicians at their worst. Obama backs a windfall tax on energy companies to fund 'emergency' refunds for low-income families; McCain has suggested a fuel tax holiday, suspending levies at the pump for up to three months.</p> <p>'Most economists would regard both proposals as not good ideas,' says Nigel Gault, chief US economist at Global Insight. He argues that a windfall tax is unpleasantly arbitrary, while a fuel tax holiday would lead only to higher consumption, boosting the profits of already well-fattened oil companies. </p> <p>'There's a problem with the US economy of too much spending, too much consumption,' says Gault. 'People need to save more. So it feels odd that you get out of a downturn by telling people: \"Here's some money, go spend more\".'</p> <p>With the countdown to polling day under way, a majority of voters appear to have grasped the basics of the two candidates' stances. In a Pew Research poll this week, 56 per cent said they knew 'a lot' or 'a fair amount' about Obama's economic plan and 54 per cent were familiar with McCain's proposals.</p> <p>Critics, however, question whether either candidate is being sufficiently frank. A neutral body, the Tax Policy Centre, has been trying to divine the cost of the promises made by each side. It reckons that Obama's tax-and-spend plans will add $3.5 trillion to national debt by 2018, while McCain's tax-cutting proposals amount to $5 trillion. </p> <p>In true populist tradition, both campaigns have been only too willing to promise extra spending. But neither side has outlined any cuts, with the exception of a pledge by McCain to stamp out pork barrel-style Congressional 'earmarks' for local projects - the most famous of which was $230m in 2004 to fund a so-called 'bridge to nowhere' between two islands in a remote part of Alaska. </p> <p>Roberton Williams, principal research associate at the Tax Policy Centre, says the difference is clear: 'McCain is saying, \"Let's cut taxes for everybody and help the economy grow,\" on the basis that a rising tide lifts all boats. Obama is arguing that the rich have got very rich and can afford to pay a little more because the people at the bottom are struggling.'</p> <p>But, he adds, radical-sounding messages from the candidates are often 'clarified' into blander proposals by backroom advisers: 'There's a real tension between the policy people and the political people. On the stump, they want to say things that are simple and that resonate.'</p> <p>Both campaigns are seeking endorsements from business leaders to add a dusting of gravitas to their economic expertise. McCain has secured public support from the veteran FedEx boss Fred Smith, from Merrill Lynch's John Thain and Sun Microsystems' Scott McNealy. </p> <p>The Obama side boasts fewer big business names, although it does have the vote of the world's richest man, Warren Buffett, a longstanding Democrat. Other Obama fans include former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker; and the campaign is assiduously courting Google's chief executive, Eric Schmidt.</p> <p>International trade remains an evergreen fissure running through US politics. While McCain has been firm in his defence of the free trade agreement, Nafta, the Democrats have promised, albeit without specifics, to renegotiate treaties to protect US workers.</p> <p>Luke Froeb, a free enterprise expert at Vanderbilt University's management school in Nashville, identifies this as a key ideological gap. He argues: 'Renegotiating Nafta would make our economy a lot less flexible. It would reduce income and make us all worse off.'</p> <p>An overt McCain supporter, Froeb views Obama as a classic interventionist who overestimates the government's power to control the economy. 'He's relatively young. He knows enough to be arrogant and not enough to be humble,' Froeb says. 'Whereas McCain knows enough to be humble. He sees a problem and he may understand that there isn't an immediate solution.'</p> <p>More radical aspirations lurk behind both programmes. McCain has talked of an overhaul of America's tax code to replace the present six income bands with just two. Obama has floated a crackdown on predatory behaviour by banks - including a 'risk rating' system advising consumers on which credit cards to take out.</p> <p>In contrast with Britain's increasingly narrow political battleground, where 'tax rise' remains a deadly phrase, the US election amounts to a true collision of economic philosophy. Yet for all the boldness of the proposals, executive authority is strictly limited - any plans will inevitably be altered in lengthy tugs-of-war through Congress.</p> <p>As the long, hard run-in to polling day begins, both sides are keen to distance themselves from President Bush's economic legacy. The Obama camp is hopeful that this year's downturn could create just enough disillusionment to push its man over the line.</p> <p>'We did not arrive at the doorstep of our current economic crisis by some accident of history,' Obama told a recent rally in North Carolina. 'It was the logical conclusion of a tired and misguided philosophy that has dominated Washington for far too long.'</p> <h2>Key economic policies</h2> <p><strong>Obama</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> A fresh stimulus to the economy of $50bn, including sending out $20bn of tax rebate cheques and creating a $10bn fund to prevent home foreclosures</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong>Rolling back Bush's tax cuts for wealthier Americans by increasing taxes on those earning more than $250,000</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong>A windfall tax on oil and gas companies to fund 'emergency energy rebates' of up to $1,000 for low- and middle-income families</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong>The creation of a national infrastructure reinvestment bank to build roads, bridges and other transport links, comprising $60bn of federal money over a decade</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong>A five-star risk rating system and a bill of rights to crack down on predatory tactics by credit card companies</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong>Tackling the Nafta free trade pact so that it benefits American workers</p> <p><strong>McCain</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong>Keeping and extending the Bush administration's sweeping tax cuts</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong>A fuel tax 'holiday' for motorists by suspending levies on petrol for a period of up to three months</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong>A 'home plan' to tackle the sub-prime crisis that would help 200,000-400,000 people by providing new 30-year fixed-rate mortgages to replace burdensome delinquent loans</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong>Giving families a fiscal break by doubling the annual tax allowance per child from $3,500 to $7,000</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong>Building 45 nuclear power stations, creating up to 700,000 jobs</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong>Defending Nafta and pushing for more free-trade treaties with other nations</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong>Ending all farm subsidies that are not based on 'clear need'</p> <h2>Healthcare reform: My costly experience of a failed system</h2> <p>Financing a comprehensive healthcare system available to all 300 million Americans, whatever their means or status, is one of the biggest problems facing whoever moves into the White House.</p> <p>Fixing America's arcane private health insurance system is far more significant than either Barack Obama or John McCain has thus far managed to elucidate. The current system can put so much stress on a family's finances that it dictates the lives of many. It determines the type of job you take, or, for those many millions not provided with health insurance at work, it forces you to take a second or third job just to pay the premiums.</p> <p>And even with insurance you may not be safe. The latest figures from the American Association of Retired Persons show that more than 1.85 million Americans - many of whom have what they think is very good health insurance - are every year forced into bankruptcy because of a medical emergency. </p> <p>More than 45 million Americans don't have any health insurance to speak of, nor do they qualify for the paltry amount of free healthcare made available to the very poorly off.</p> <p>I learnt last week how broken, stressful and altogether backwards the American system of paying for healthcare can be when I was unexpectedly admitted to my local hospital for an MRI scan.</p> <p>I am lucky enough to have a wife who works at a big US company that provides us with much better health insurance than we could ever afford to buy. This, coupled with the fact that I was weaned on the good old NHS, meant I was not remotely concerned about the cost of my visit to the hospital. Until I got there.</p> <p>The first thing I had to do at the reception of New York Methodist Hospital in Park Slope, Brooklyn, was phone my insurance company - even though I was being admitted as an emergency. I sat on the phone for 45 minutes responding to various recorded messages, punching one for yes and two for no as if I was paying my cable bill. At the end of this process, I was told that my insurance did not cover the first $721 of the MRI scan and only 80 per cent of the emergency treatment and any other subsequent hospital stay, drugs etc.</p> <p>A spell in hospital costs hundreds if not thousands of dollars a day and I was to be admitted for a minimum of five days. I was also slated for at least three MRIs, a lumbar puncture and lots of medication.</p> <p>And that is when the reality of living with the American healthcare system really sank in. I was no longer thinking about my potentially serious spinal cord injury. I was thinking about medical bills.</p> <p>McCain does not seek to alter the status quo sufficiently to give Americans respite from the current potentially crippling system. Sadly, Obama's proposals to fix it do not go far enough either.</p> <p>But both of them must know that until Americans can live secure in the knowledge that a single trip to the ER will not wipe out their finances for good, the 'dream' they speak of living will remain a financial nightmare for all but the very wealthiest.<br><strong>James Doran</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on September 8 2008.

  "<p>Inside a tucked-away room in a rarefied part of central London, there is a murmur of civilised chatter and the click-clack of designer shoes on parquet floor. In the corner, two well-dressed women are exchanging feverish whispers. 'I want it,' says one. 'Well I saw it first!' the other hisses.</p> <p>It is the sort of scene one might expect at a high-end fashion boutique where the trade is in cut-price designer clothes or must-have handbags. But this is a private view of an unknown artist's work, a recent graduate from art college who specialises in intricately crafted oil paintings. The two women are not desperate fashionistas, but rival art collectors, and their latest killer accessory is a piece of art from the Next Big Thing.</p> <p>'It was extraordinary,' says a bystander. 'They were literally fighting over the piece. It got to the stage where they were bidding against each other in the middle of the room. And this wasn't even for a well-known artist - that's a mark of just how competitive the art market has become.'</p> <p>There used to be an accepted wisdom that you couldn't put a price on great art. But that was before creativity became a commodity; before it became an asset so bankable that investors could be virtually guaranteed a three-fold return in the space of a year. Now, with a new generation of self-made collectors with an eye for talent and money to burn, art is big business and everything has a price tag.</p> <p>Last week, the Duke of Sutherland's decision to sell a pair of Titian paintings for \u00a350m each acted as a forceful reminder of art's rampant commercialisation. The two works - Diana and Actaeon and Diana and Callisto - have been on loan to the National Gallery of Scotland in Edinburgh for more than 60 years as part of the Bridgewater Collection, one of the most important private art collections in the world.</p> <p>It says something about art's upwardly spiralling value over the last decade that the sum of \u00a3100m for two Titians is now viewed as a bit of a bargain. The Duke of Sutherland, advised by his accountants to diversify his portfolio in a time of economic uncertainty, is said to take his public responsibilities very seriously; although it will be a formidable challenge for the money to be raised by the end of the year, it is generally acknowledged that the paintings would fetch three times as much on the open market.</p> <p>The potential loss of such a substantial chunk of the nation's cultural heritage prompted a public outcry. The artist Tracey Emin pointed out that the paintings could be saved if everyone in the UK contributed 'the price of a packet of biscuits'. Jeffrey Archer, the peer and novelist, waded into the fray with his opinion that \u00a3100m would be better spent on a children's hospital. Whatever the rights and wrongs of spending public money on works of art, one thing remains certain: if the public purse does not buy the Titians, someone else's will. </p> <p>Over the last five years, a new kind of private buyer has emerged in the art world and transformed the cultural landscape. Competition for works is cut-throat, with buyers emerging from Russia, Asia and the Middle East. </p> <p>Often, these new collectors are self-made millionaires with a background in private finance, such as David Roberts, a property developer whose collection of 2,000 works has made him one of the UK's most sought-after buyers. Increasingly, they are women with a flair for spotting new talent and a bottomless capacity for networking - women such as Daria Zhukova, the girlfriend of Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich, who has just opened a Moscow gallery that is tipped to become Russia's answer to Tate Modern. Sometimes they are Middle Eastern oil magnates seeking a new outlet for their investment, such as Sheikh Saud al-Thani, the first cousin of the emir of Qatar whose outlay dwarfs that of other auction-room habitu\u00e9s such as Elton John, Bill Gates or the Sultan of Brunei.</p> <p>There is, for all of the new vanguard, a certain aspirational cachet to owning important works of art. Even more importantly, there is also a surefire economic return. At London's annual Frieze contemporary art fair, demand has become so intense that serious buyers need to get their name on a reserve list before the most desirable works go on sale. 'Unless you're on the list, there's no chance' says Isabella Macpherson, the co-founder of the art agency Arts Co. 'Hence the \"new collectors\" are doing their due diligence, building relationships with gallerists and dealers, going to the international art fairs and all this becomes a bit addictive because it's glamorous - a closed circle of fabulous events and supposed creativity - and that's a giddy ride for them.'</p> <p>The London art market has enjoyed a resurgence in recent years with wealthy natives, and the influx of cash-rich 'non-domiciles', turning increasingly to art as both passion and investment. Prominent among these is Newcastle-born Anita Zabludowicz. She collects art with her billionaire Finnish husband Poju who runs the private investment group Tamares. So extensive and prestigous is their collection that late last year Zabludowicz opened the 176 institution in Camden, north London, a venue to show works from the collection. London-based Persian collector Fatima Maleki first acquired old masters before developing her interest in contemporary art. She stresses the global nature of the collecting mania at this very high level: 'Art is taking people across the world' and notes how insiders are beginning to look more towards the Middle East. </p> <p>New collectors such as these contrast strongly with the old establishment figures such as the reclusive John Paul Getty or the immaculately educated Denis Mahon, who both belong to a different era of eccentric personal tastes and inherited family wealth.</p> <p>'Historically, collectors were quiet connoisseurs who took their time, studied their purchases and were under no pressure to buy because there were so few of them,' says Sarah Thornton, the author of Seven Days in the Art World. 'In the past five years, there has been a relentless boom. Now you go to an art fair and all the work on a stand will have sold out within two hours.'</p> <p>The febrile atmosphere has largely been driven by art markets opening up in unexpected places - in Qatar, an oil state looking for new sources of revenue, five international art museums are currently in the pipeline. </p> <p>'In Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, there are plans to open up a Louvre franchise - a nametag that cost them \u00a3260m. Investors from the Middle East remain the most likely buyers for the Bridgewater Titians, although they might be put off by the paintings' partial nudity.</p> <p>David Roberts, one of the UK's foremost art collectors whose collection includes works by Damien Hirst and Marc Quinn, says: 'The deep-pocketed overseas buyers have meant that prices have gone completely crazy and yes, that does make it more difficult to buy pieces.'</p> <p>Roberts, who is launching a foundation to benefit young curators and artists, is an increasingly rare breed - a collector who buys purely for the love of it and who simultaneously acknowledges a responsibility to make his works available for public view. 'I've never sold anything and I've no idea of my collection's value. I do think it is a great shame in general when something that's quite important in the art world disappears into private hands never to be seen again.</p> <p>'There is a national pride attached to the Titians. I think it is important to have good, great quality work in the UK. It is important to have it on your doorstep, for it to be accessible to people.'</p> <p>But with art becoming such a global enterprise, does it really matter whether the Duke of Sutherland's Titians remain in British possession? Presumably, the paintings would have just as much impact if they were on view in other countries and, with the advent of the travelling 'blockbuster' show, there is an increased chance that works sold abroad will come back on tour in the future?</p> <p>'I really believe in culture as an ambassador of ideas,' says Thornton. 'I think it can make great contributions to fledgling democracies and a Titian could have even more of an impact being seen in Doha [capital city of Qatar] than in London because it challenges a whole raft of psychological assumptions. </p> <p>'We are spoiled in the UK because we have so many masterpieces. It would be quite exciting for the paintings to be available somewhere that had never been exposed to this kind of art before.'</p> <p>Wherever the Titians end up, their sale will inevitably stoke the fires of the international art market. Art has become the new social status symbol. Now everyone wants a bit of it, at whatever price the seller puts on creativity. As the legendary New York gallery owner Mary Boone once said: 'I had reservations about making art a business. But I got over it.'</p> <h2>Saved for the nation</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>In 2003, the Getty Museum offered the Duke of Northumberland \u00a335 million for Raphael's <strong>Madonna of the Pinks</strong> believed to be one of the finest old master paintings in private hands. The National Gallery declared the sale would be a 'serious loss' for the nation. After donations, including \u00a311.5 million from the Heritage Lottery Fund, the Duke agreed to sell the masterpiece to the National Gallery for \u00a322 million.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Sir Joshua Reynolds' <strong>Portrait of Omai</strong> is now in the Tate Gallery thanks to an anonymous \u00a312.5 million donation received after the government placed a temporary bar on the work, sold in 2002 for \u00a310.7 million. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Turner's <strong>The Blue Rigi</strong>, one of the best watercolors produced by the artist, sold for a record \u00a35.8 million in 2006, and is exhibited at the Tate. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Botticelli's <strong>Virgin Adoring the Sleeping Christ Child</strong>, previously in the collection of the Earl of Wemyss had an asking price of \u00a315 million. Though offers were made from abroad, the National Galleries of Scotland, bought the picture after numerous donations for \u00a310.25 million.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Canova's <strong>The Three Graces </strong>cost \u00a37.6 million when it was acquired jointly for the V&amp;A and National Galleries of Scotland. The Getty Museum had offered it to a private seller but its export was stopped. </p> <p><strong>Caroline Davies</strong></p>",
  "<p>Marius Kloppers, chief executive of mining giant BHP Billiton, could be the patron saint of late starters. Some titans of industry start mapping out their destiny almost from birth, but not Kloppers, who in his twenties played the role of perennial student.</p> <p>This is a comforting thought for the parents of young slackers and drifters - but only up to a point. Kloppers didn't just loaf around on the sofa in a hungover haze. He completed a first degree in chemical engineering in his native South Africa, a doctorate in materials science from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, then an MBA at the elite Insead business school in France. </p> <p>'I did a whole slew of degrees because I couldn't figure out what I wanted to do,' he says. The experience has come in useful: his wife, Carin, runs a hostel for university students where he occasionally offers counsel to directionless youth. 'There was a young man there of 30 who hasn't quite found what he wants. I told him that's fine, I really didn't discover what I wanted to do until I was well into my thirties. On the continent it is absolutely acceptable to join the workforce at 28 or 29, but in the UK there is an obsession to get a job at 21. I didn't even get a driver's licence until I was 27. When I did start, my career just evolved, there was no strong degree of planning.' </p> <p>It has been some evolution. He began work at management consultancy McKinsey, then moved into the mining industry in South Africa, where he was flummoxed by the Geordie accent of one of his superiors. 'I was a little Afrikaaner boy, recently graduated, very dapper, and I'm the bag carrier for a Geordie guy and a Scottish guy. I can understand the Scotsman, but not a word of what the Geordie is saying,' he laughs, remembering his discomfort.</p> <p>Lack of fluency in the Geordie dialect didn't hold him back. Kloppers' turbo-charged ascent took him to the chief executive's office at Anglo-Australian BHP last year at the tender age of 44. He had hardly tucked his feet under the desk before he and his doughty Australian chairman, Don Argus, launched an audacious $127bn takeover assault on rival Rio Tinto - quite something, even in the testosterone-sodden, expansionist world of mining. The bid is making waves well beyond the usual confines of the City; it is being closely watched by political leaders in Europe, the US, Australia and, most important, China.</p> <p>If Kloppers succeeds, the combined company will control 40 per cent of China's iron ore imports and have huge positions in aluminium, copper, uranium and coal. The appetite for raw materials from emerging nations is virtually insatiable. And it is no exaggeration to say that the deal would make the boyish, crop-haired executive one of the most powerful men on the planet.</p> <p>Kloppers, who spent two years in the South African army, is a tough cookie, but he is facing formidable opposition. He and Argus are up against Rio's 50-year-old American chief executive, Tom Albanese, and Paul Skinner, the company's seasoned chairman, who are not about to roll over. They make a strong case that Rio will create more value on its own than as part of the BHP behemoth, and have rejected as too low a proposal of 3.4 shares in its rival for every one Rio share held. </p> <p>The two sides have engaged in a war or words - or rather of numbers - over which company is performing the best; an objective observer is hard put to choose between their competing claims. Both, however, turned in record results this month, with BHP's full-year profits up 22 per cent and Rio's half-yearly figures also rising steeply. </p> <p>The two main hurdles for Kloppers are price and regulation. Albanese and Skinner will not even think of capitulating unless they are sure they have extracted the best possible price, so won't Kloppers have to raise his offer to win? </p> <p>'Ultimately, the shareholders will decide, not management. We feel very confident on a relative-value basis that the deal is correctly fixed, so our main focus is on clearing the regulatory hurdles,' he says, though he would hardly admit at this stage that he might be ready to increase the offer. He also expresses confidence about navigating the tortuous course through regulators in Brussels, the US and Australia, though some independent analysts are sceptical. That is on top of placating China, which, as the world's biggest steel producer, is understandably concerned. BHP has provisional permission from the American Department of Justice, but Australia's competition regulator has stopped the clock on its ruling and the European Commission is not expected to deliver a verdict before November: 'It is hard to predict, but we feel we are on solid ground with our case.' </p> <p>BHP has certainly gone to huge lengths to produce as watertight a bid as possible. It has hired a team from MIT to do all the econometric modelling. In essence, its argument boils down to the idea that BHP and Rio have a number of operations running alongside each other. BHP reckons that combining them would enable them to produce at a lower cost, giving the incentive to produce as much volume as possible, which in turn would reduce upward pressure on prices. </p> <p>As for Beijing, state-owned aluminium company Chinalco has already made a dramatic entry into the fray by buying a 12 per cent stake in Rio, which gives it a material influence over the outcome. What does Kloppers think is their game plan? 'I can only speculate. They saw a bid was coming - they must have thought they want to be part of this unfolding. If there is a log jam, you've got to have a log in it. It is an interesting position for Rio. I don't know what they think about that, but it is a big shareholding.'</p> <p>Kloppers has a reputation as a macho alpha male, but either he is on his best behaviour or is genuinely genial and personable. Home, insofar as someone who sleeps so often on aircraft has one, is in Melbourne, with Carin, his childhood sweetheart, and their three children. When he talks about his family, the warmth is obvious, but his softly spoken words can carry an undertone of menace when discussing the bid. </p> <p>'There is no such thing as an unfriendly deal at the end of the day,' he says, which is true, since the vanquished company is left with little choice. 'It would have been much easier if we could have been really friendly right from the start. The competition side would have been easier, and it would have been easier to think about social arrangements when we combine management teams and so on. Unfortunately, that is not where they are. We still hope that at the earliest possible moment they will start understanding.</p> <p>'But nobody has done anything here that is not by the rules of cricket. Nobody has destroyed the ability of these two companies to work together.' </p> <p>However, most mergers, as Kloppers well knows, don't increase value, they destroy it. Why should this deal be in the minority that work? 'These two companies have a basically Anglo-Saxon heritage, they operate the same sort of mines, they live by the same sort of values. We hire each others' people all the time - you are not combining radically different cultures.</p> <p>'Then there is a steely determination on our part always to simplify. We would want to make it the simplest possible business. Before merging with Billiton, BHP had 110,000 people. Now we have 40,000 because we have sold all of our downstream businesses and all our smaller operations and concentrated on the big ones. The organisational structure is simple, there are no fancy charts. In the end, we dig stuff out of the ground.' He adds that the two companies operate alongside each other in the iron-rich Pilbara region of Western Australia, they have diamond mines next to each other, and jointly run the Escondida copper mine in Chile: 'We overlap all over the place. We would just say one management team, one management team, one management team.'</p> <p>Given that energy and resources are increasingly being used as weapons in the new great geopolitical game, is there a sense in which the West needs its own champion? 'It is important for the West to look at who operates in the free market according to free-market principles. In that respect, our deal cements Rio Tinto into the free-market system. </p> <p>'I think Europe would view Australia or Canada as a raw materials supplier a little bit differently than they view Russia. The demeanour is different, the relationship is different. I think if I extrapolate from what is happening in energy, it is interesting to think about that in raw materials.' </p> <p>Mining companies have traditionally been viewed as dirty, exploitative corporate bogeymen, but nowadays they are keen to be seen as socially responsible. How does Kloppers deal with the issue of doing business with China amid the furore over human rights? 'It is a tough one. China has pulled so many people from poverty - I think that is important as well. Our challenges are about where we source things; you have to be so careful you don't run foul of sweatshops or child labour. That is probably the thing I worry about quite a bit. I can't change the practices of my clients who buy raw materials, but I can change the practices of people I buy from.'</p> <p>There are concerns that BHP - and Rio - could be hit if the rate of Chinese growth has peaked. Kloppers concedes that China will be affected by the credit crunch, but believes that its underlying momentum is unstoppable.</p> <p>'You can't argue that the West slowing down is positive for China. Net exports are about 10 per cent of the economy and they are suffering. But I do think China is a big beast; for the first time since America entered the industrial age we have an economy that has a local market of scale. China has slowed down itself, but the desire to become rich before they grow old is very strong. </p> <p>'They have no choice but to keep their economy going, otherwise they are going to get that demographic day when their workforce starts declining and they can't support their pensioners. India has much less of a problem because they had no one-child policy.</p> <p>'That makes me very positive that this growth will continue for decades. The Chinese have a huge amount of infrastructure yet to build. The basic driver is bigger houses as you become more affluent. The Chinese want the same size house as their Western counterparts.'</p> <p>Kloppers is fascinating on the broader questions facing the mining industry, but cannot resist talking about the bid for long: 'This deal is about relative value. We are proposing that their shareholders stay in and grab a piece of the extra value we can create by putting things together. We call it a deal for all seasons.</p> <p>'I have a hundred people in London working on this deal and nothing else. We have pulled them out of their normal jobs and put other people in. This deal is the one with by far the biggest potential. Everything else would be an order of magnitude lower on my radar screen. I would feel a little sheepish if it didn't work out.'</p> <h2>Takeover timetable</h2> <p><strong>1 Nov 2007:</strong> BHP Billiton writes to the board of Rio Tinto proposing a combination </p> <p><strong>21 Ded 2007: </strong>The UK Takeover panel imposes a put up or shut up deadline of 6 February 2009 </p> <p><strong>1 Feb 2008:</strong> Chinalco purchases 12 per cent of Rio Tinto </p> <p><strong>6 Feb 2008:</strong><strong> </strong>BHP Billiton announces its offer for Rio Tinto, at a ratio of 3.4 BHP Billiton shares for each Rio Tinto share</p> <p><strong>3 July 2008: </strong>BHP receives clearance from the US Justice Department</p> <p><strong>4 July 2008: </strong>The European Commission announces its move to a 'Phase II' investigation of the proposed deal</p>",
  "<p>Roger Hiorns is unconventional. Most people, when faced with a derelict housing estate in one of the grimier parts of south London, would empty their pockets of valuables and reach for the nearest stab-proof vest. Hiorns, however, decided it was perfectly reasonable to pour 90,000 litres of copper sulphate solution into an empty bedsit in the name of art.</p> <p>'It's been a slightly surreal summer,' says the 33-year-old artist as he walks about the site in a camouflage jacket and skinny jeans. He blinks at me through tortoiseshell Michael Caine spectacles. 'The tenants' association who lent us the building seemed quite happy with a lot of chemicals on their doorstep.'</p> <p>Seizure is the latest urban-landscape commission by Artangel, the innovative art organisation behind some of the most memorable work of the last decade, including Rachel Whiteread's House (1993) and Antony Gormley's 25-metre-high Waste Man (2006).</p> <p>Over a 10-week period, Hiorns has transformed an end-of-the-line council flat, due for demolition, into an ambitious art installation in the heart of Elephant and Castle. It was a complicated process, more like a giant schoolboy chemistry experiment than a delicately crafted artwork.</p> <p>First, a hole was drilled in the floor of the upstairs flat. Then, giant plastic containers of copper sulphate were poured through it into a sealed tank constructed to occupy the dimensions of the bedsit below. The solution was left to cool at an ambient temperature of 20C to form into bright blue crystals. </p> <p>At least, that was the theory. If the temperature had not been kept stable or if the weather had been unseasonably hot, Hiorns would have been left with a pile of powdery sediment and a bedsit flooded with toxic chemicals (copper sulphate is more commonly used as a pesticide for vines).</p> <p>'What we've found building this piece is that we've basically built a massive lack of control,' says Hiorns, a graduate of Goldsmiths who has previously exhibited in Tate Britain and the Cubitt Gallery, London. 'I wanted to use a material that would take me out of the equation. Copper sulphate makes its own aesthetic and that makes me, the artist, disappear. I like working with that ambiguity.'</p> <p>Today is the first day anyone has been able to examine the results. So I find myself in a deserted corner of Harper Road, SE1, a place of boarded-up windows, concrete and rusted playground swings. But as I walk through a doorway of the left-hand corner flat, the environment is suddenly transformed into a sparkling secret grotto. Inside the walls, floors and ceilings are covered with stalactites of luminescent, hyacinth blue. The bath is overgrown with jewel-like shards of alien coral.</p> <p>'It's a sort of lapis lazuli colour,' says Hiorns. 'Yves Klein always comes up but I noticed it was actually like the blue lights on police car sirens.'</p> <p>And yet, despite the work's toxic, destructive nature, I can't help but be smitten with its unexpected beauty; nestling like glittering treasure in the concrete heart of the city.</p>",
  "<p>The balance of economic and financial power is shifting from developed economies in the West to emerging economies, led by China and India, and including commodity producers such as Brazil and Russia, and countries in Asia and the Middle East with large savings.</p> <p>The recent global economic boom already reflects this, with emerging economies not only growing strongly but heavily influencing conditions in the West. Cheap goods from China, often produced by Western firms, helped to keep global inflation down ahead of the recent surge in commodity prices, and savings flowed 'uphill' from Asia and the Middle East to the US, allowing that country to live beyond its means, as seen by its huge trade deficit.</p> <p>These imbalances are unwinding and, along with the credit crunch, point to a painful adjustment for the West. The UK faces recession and needs to resolve many issues, not least how to position itself in this changing global landscape.</p> <p>First, the shift in economic power is set to continue. This is highlighted by the pace and scale of change in China. Beijing spent more on the Olympics than the five previous cities put together, but it was a drop in the ocean for them. Across China, the private sector has been let loose. Yet, not all the investment taking place there is as productive as it should be, and China lacks the institutional set-up and policy tools it needs to control the boom.</p> <p>There is a similar challenge in other countries and one should expect increased volatility. The trend may be up, but the business cycle still exists. Indeed, over the next year, growth in emerging economies including China and India should slow. Yet, any downturn is more likely to be seen as a temporary pause in a super-growth cycle.</p> <p>Strong, underlying forces are at work. Quite literally, an industrial revolution is taking place. It is seen in China now. India will be next as, with its young population, it moves into manufacturing, and it is not uncommon to hear people talk about Africa's future potential in mass manufacturing.</p> <p>The challenge in many regions is to generate jobs for a huge swathe of both skilled and unskilled workers, and this explains why there is huge investment and an infrastructure boom around the world; investment not just in roads and bridges but in soft infrastructure, aimed at boosting educational, scientific, language and technical skills. There is a desire to move up the value curve and become knowledge-based economies, directly challenging us.</p> <p>This also explains why many countries are developing their financial markets. Already in the City there is talk of competition from Dubai. In turn, tax competition is becoming a reality as countries seek to attract international firms and highly skilled workers. The UK must rise to these challenges, dealing with skills problems, investing more heavily in its science base and retaining its competitive edge with the right mix of tax and regulation.</p> <p>The balance of financial power is already shifting. Sovereign wealth funds are a clear example of this. The bulk of these government-controlled funds are in the Middle East and Asia, and were established to build up assets on behalf of the state. They have shot to attention as the number of countries with such funds is rising, the amounts at their disposal are huge and their potential targets more controversial. Already this year, these sovereign funds have come to the rescue of some banks and financial firms in the US and UK, injecting much-needed capital.</p> <p>Emerging economies are embracing this shift in financial firepower. When I visited Brazil this year, I found many who felt that a recession in America would not affect them but that one in China would hurt. Only five years ago across east Asia it was common to hear complaints about China's competitive threat. Now it is seen as a growth opportunity, a market to sell into. Intra-Asian trade has soared, as has trade between Asia and the Middle East, Africa and Latin America.</p> <p>These new trade corridors reflect increased flows of goods and commodities, of people and remittances, and of portfolio and direct investment. Eventually this will have negative consequences for the dollar, despite its recent bounce, and it could change geopolitics as emerging regions work together.</p> <p>In this environment, energy security has already become a key issue. Water and food security may be next. There is insatiable global demand for commodities. More than two thirds of the incremental demand for oil in recent years came from Russia, the Gulf and China. There has been a step-change in energy use that supply will struggle to keep pace with. For instance, if China was to move to half the car usage of Europe, it would need all the cars currently in existence in both the US and Europe.</p> <p>Russia and Saudi Arabia are important for Europe's energy needs, and Europe must compete for that energy with China. Over recent years Saudi and Russia have courted one another, even signing an arms agreement this year. This would have been unthinkable eight years ago.</p> <p>It is not just oil. China's involvement across Africa is huge, and commodities are the reason. Across Africa, one only hears China and the US mentioned, despite Europe being Africa's biggest trading partner. Which makes one wonder whether Europe needs more strategic thinking on issues such as energy; and whether the shift in economic and financial power will trigger a shift in the balance of military and political power.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Dr Gerard Lyons is chief economist at Standard Chartered, William Keegan is away</p>",
  "<p>On Friday, Shriti Vadera, the business minister and baroness, did not mince her words when she spoke to the senior executive of one of the Big Six energy suppliers. 'If you don't sign up to the package, we will do something you won't like,' was her terse warning before she hung up. </p> <p>She was talking about the \u00a31bn package of new funding and measures to tackle fuel poverty Gordon Brown is desperate to announce this week. The government wants the suppliers (German-owned Eon and RWE's Npower, the French giant EDF, Spanish-owned Scottish Power and independent UK groups Centrica and Scottish and Southern Energy) to stump up the cash. Vadera has been charged with getting them to fall into line. If they don't, the threat of a much bigger windfall tax is lurking in the background. The only trouble is, the European-owned utilities are calling the government's bluff.</p> <p>Last week, RWE and Scottish Power announced another rise in fuel bills of up to 34 per cent. By the end of the year an estimated six million households in the UK will be in fuel poverty, defined as spending more than a tenth of income on energy bills. Yet the government has set itself a legally binding target to eradicate most fuel poverty by the end of the decade, a pledge looking more hollow by the day. Treasury coffers are nearly empty - so the utility companies are being asked to foot the bill.</p> <p>The companies are staunchly resisting any move for a tax raid. This is hardly surprising, but the industry is in a strong position and deep down the government knows it. The companies hold all the aces, which they have been playing recently to great effect, as they did the last time the threat of a windfall tax loomed, before April's budget. The government wants utility companies to keep the lights on, to build thousands of wind farms to meet new renewable energy targets - and now to stump up for a windfall tax to cut prices for the poorest customers. Something has to give. A spokesman for Eon says: 'We can't do it all.'</p> <p>This year the government signed up to a European commitment which would require about a third of the UK's electricity to come from green sources by 2020, compared with barely 5 per cent today. It estimates that building the new kit - including thousands of wind farms - would cost at least \u00a3100bn. To put this in context, in the most recent significant investment drive, \u00a314bn has been spent building almost 50 gas power plants and renewable generators since 1990, according to the regulator Ofgem. David Porter, chief executive of trade association AEP (the Association of Electricity Producers), says: 'This must be the biggest investment programme the industry has ever seen.' </p> <p>Privately, most energy executives think meeting these targets is impossible. But they nevertheless argue that they need a healthy level of profits in the UK to make the investment necessary to try. Companies are threatening not to make that investment if there is a tax grab. </p> <p>Proponents of a windfall tax, such as Compass, the group of left-wing Labour MPs, say this is an idle threat. After all, in 1997, the New Labour government levied a \u00a34.5bn windfall tax on the utilities without the sky falling in; the lights did not go out and fuel bills did not rise. But Chris Sanger, head of tax policy at Ernst &amp; Young and former adviser to Brown in the Treasury, who helped to draw up the 1997 windfall tax plan, says it is wrong to compare then with now. The tax was in Labour's pre-election manifesto and was supposed to be a one-off.More importantly, it was accepted in 1997 that the recently privatised utilities had been sold off too cheaply, he recalls, and benefited from an overly lax regulatory regime. 'This allowed companies to make superprofits,' he says. </p> <p>Today, it is not clear that utilities are making windfall profits from their normal activities. Most utility bills may have gone up by more than a third this year, but this is because the wholesale price of gas has risen in line with soaring oil prices, adding to suppliers' costs. It is true that companies continue to make healthy profits from the UK - and pay out big dividends - but much of the money is reinvested into building new plants and other infrastructure. </p> <p>And the difference between 1997 and now is that most of the industry is foreign-owned. In 1997, utilities did not have the option of investing somewhere else. Today, four of the Big Six are part of European utility conglomerates that make their investment decisions in Dusseldorf, Paris and Madrid. Rightly or wrongly, the utilities are under no obligation to build new power stations in the UK. As Sanger from Ernst &amp; Young says: 'Capital is mobile and will go where the best investment is.'</p> <p>The utilities are, however, benefiting from windfall profits of a different kind that are both rarely reported and little understood. According to regulator Ofgem, the companies stand to make an estimated \u00a311bn windfall profit over the next four years on the back of the European Union's emissions trading scheme. This was designed to reduce carbon emissions, not to enable the utilities to make a killing. The biggest scandal is that you and I are funding this windfall through higher utility bills. </p> <p>This is how this perfectly legal racket works: companies receive most of their pollution allowances for free. Each allowance permits the owner to emit one tonne of carbon and can be bought and sold on the market to other scheme participants. Power generators can choose to sell their allowances or use them to operate their carbon-emitting plants. If the utility decides to use its allowance, it denies itself the opportunity to sell it on the market and bank the cash. As a result, utilities add this 'opportunity cost' to their generating costs, adding an estimated extra \u00a331 on to each consumer's annual bill.</p> <p>The AEP disputes Ofgem's calculations and the profits are likely to be less. The scheme involves some costs for generators: they have to buy in extra allowances to cover all their operations, and invest in more efficient technology to reduce their emissions. But privately most of the Big Six admit that they will profit from the scheme. No one knows precisely by how much, as the profits are consolidated in each group's trading arm, which for Eon, for example, is based in Dusseldorf. And the level of profits depends on the carbon price over the next five years. </p> <p>The government has already agreed to auction 7 per cent of the allowances distributed between now and 2012, raising up to \u00a31bn based on today's carbon price. When a company has to buy an allowance, rather than receive it free, it incurs a real cost, rather than the equivalent notional 'opportunity cost' it has been passing on regardless to consumers. The government is now proposing auctioning off an extra 3 per cent of permits to raise an additional \u00a3500m and using this money to tackle fuel poverty. Yet changing the rules requires approval from the EC and the European-owned utilities are refusing to pay up. </p> <p>What is clear is that the government's dependence on utilities to keep the lights on and meet its green targets means its options are limited. Brown is desperate to show voters he has won extra cash from the big bad utilities to tackle fuel poverty, but he may not achieve anything substantial other than a few headlines. </p> <p>Jenny Saunders, chief executive of charity National Energy Action, says: 'Wherever the resources come from, the government needs to do much more to tackle fuel poverty. Voluntary payments by companies are only scratching the surface of the problem.'</p>",
  "<p>The number of soldiers who end up in prison for violent offences has increased dramatically in the past four years, according to a report that has raised concerns about the mental health of military personnel returning from war zones. Compiled by probation officers, the report estimates that at least 8,500 former soldiers are in custody - 9 per cent of the UK prison population and nearly double the estimate of a previous study by the Home Office in 2004, which put the figure at 5 per cent.</p> <p>But even the estimate by Napo, the probation trade union, may be on the low side. In a sign that the Ministry of Defence is increasingly aware of the problem, it recently carried out its own assessment in conjunction with the Ministry of Justice and ex-services charities. A pilot study at Dartmoor prison concluded that almost 17 per cent of inmates had been members of the armed forces.</p> <p>'It is of real concern that thousands of soldiers are in prison and many more are on parole or community service orders,' said Harry Fletcher of Napo. 'In virtually every incidence the former soldier served in either the Gulf or Afghanistan, became involved in excess alcohol or drug-taking, and was subsequently convicted of an offence of violence.'</p> <p>The Napo report was compiled from more than 70 case studies. Whatever the true figure, it is apparent that soldiers comprise by far the largest occupational group in the prison system. 'It is clearly worrying that a significant proportion of people in the penal system are ex-servicemen and it doesn't say much for the support given to those leaving the military,' said Andrew Neilson of the Howard League for Penal Reform.</p> <p>'An inability to cope with civilian life, particularly for those who joined the services on leaving school, can certainly lead to offending and see someone swapping one institution for another.'</p> <p>Often it is those closest to the soldiers who are victims of their violence. The report cites the example of one serviceman who struggled to adapt to civilian life after six years in the army. His relationship with his partner broke down and she stopped him seeing his children because of his heavy drinking. Verbal abuse turned to physical abuse, which led to a jail sentence.</p> <p>Another soldier ended up in a prison in Humberside for actual bodily harm. According to his probation report, he started drinking heavily after he returned from having served in Bosnia at the age of 19. The soldier said he had not been prepared for what he saw while on peacekeeping duties. For years he could not get the image of people nailed to trees out of his mind.</p> <p>'The number of soldiers in prison is definitely on the rise,' said Tracey Johnson of Veterans in Prison, which believes there is a link between the intensity of the army's current missions in Iraq and Afghanistan and the number of soldiers currently in jail. 'They're fighting in back-to-back conflicts, coming out and going back again; they haven't got time to recover. There are not enough of them. They don't have the right cover or equipment and they're absolutely knackered.'</p> <p>The organisation has been inundated with letters from soldiers in prison. In virtually every case it believes that the writers were suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). One father said that before his son was jailed for threatening to shoot another soldier, he had been wetting his bed and in floods of tears because 'he couldn't get Iraq out of his head'.</p> <p>'He told me they often had to raid buildings where they believed terrorists were hiding,' the man wrote. 'Because he is a big strong lad, he had the heavy machine gun and so had to enter these buildings first and in his words \"was shit scared\". I told him anybody would be in that situation, but I got the impression he felt it was a sign of weakness.'</p> <p>David Bradley, 43, developed post-traumatic stress after serving in Northern Ireland. In 2006, he shot his uncle, aunt and two cousins at close range with a pistol he had smuggled into the UK after serving in Bosnia. Several hours later, armed with a nail bomb, a sawn-off shotgun and a pistol with silencer and ammunition, Bradley walked into his local police station in Newcastle and calmly said: 'I have killed four members of my family.'</p> <p>As the incidence of post-traumatic stress becomes more prevalent there are suspicions that some soldiers will cite combat fatigue as an excuse for their criminal behaviour. 'There are those who say they have it as some sort of amelioration for their actions,' conceded Peter Poole, director of welfare services at the charity Combat Stress.</p> <p>The Napo report provides some of the most credible evidence to date that stress is a major factor behind the rise in the number of soldiers going to jail. Dozens of clinical psychiatric assessments speak of soldiers suffering from post-traumatic stress when they attack others. Often the disorder is not identified until the soldier enters the prison system.</p> <p>'Military operations in recent years have placed the armed forces under increased pressures,' said Derek Howard-Budd, head of welfare at the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Families Association. 'Associated issues like PTSD can take a long time before symptoms develop and much longer to be diagnosed.'</p> <p>Post-traumatic stress has been dubbed 'the hidden wound' - the injury that is never talked about because of the stigma attached to soldiers suffering psychological problems. 'The idea that it is not a \"real\" condition is inherited from the First World War, where shell-shock among troops was thought to be a sign of weakness,' said Bridget O'Connell, of the mental health charity Mind. 'Now, with a better understanding of the way trauma affects us, this notion is long-since outdated.'</p> <p>It was not until he was serving life for murder that Tracey Johnson's husband, Jimmy, who was the victim of a bomb attack while serving in the army in Northern Ireland, became aware he had problems. She fears that many more soldiers will end up going the same way. 'Many of them don't even know they've got it,' she said.</p> <p>Despite heightened concerns about the prevalence of the condition, there are claims that little is being done to assess soldiers' mental health when they return from war zones. What help is available is usually on an ad hoc basis and often available only when they have been incarcerated. Staff at Everthorpe prison in Brough, East Yorkshire, have become so concerned at the lack of support traumatised soldiers receive upon release that they have taken to issuing them with information packs giving details of mental health charities.</p> <p>Groups such as Combat Stress can be effective, but have limited resources. 'We can only help those who seek help,' Poole said. 'And there are more people than we are equipped to deal with.'</p> <p>In a statement to The Observer, the MoD said that counselling was available to service personnel at all times, and pointed out that all troops receive briefings before and after deployment to help them recognise the signs of stress.</p> <p>'We have launched six pilot schemes of community-based veterans' mental health therapists which will be rolled out across the UK,' the MoD said in a statement. 'Veterans can also receive free mental health assessments from a consultant psychiatrist with a military background. This service is also available to veterans in prison.'</p> <p>But politicians said it was clear that more needs to be done to identify and treat post-traumatic stress at an early stage. The Labour MP John McDonnell, who is secretary of the Justice Unions All Party Group, said it was time for the government to urgently review systems for supporting serving and retired members of the armed services.</p> <p>Elfyn Llwyd, a Plaid Cymru MP who has become alarmed at the number of his constituents who have served in the armed forces and are now in prison, said that service personnel and their families were being let down. 'If better treatment was available for these servicemen, hundreds, maybe thousands, would not have offended,' he said.</p> <p>Veterans In Prison draws comparisons with the United States, where soldiers returning from war zones are put through 'decompression courses' where they are assessed by mental health experts before leaving the base.</p> <p>'Here they just get them altogether in the barracks and ask them who wants to see a shrink,' Johnson said. 'Nobody's going to put their hand up to that.'</p>",

  "<p>After opening the season with three consecutive defeats, Albion could feel content with a creditable draw, although only the coming months will determine whether their manager, Tony Mowbray, is correct in his unflinching optimism about the season ahead.</p> <p>After a bruising, physical encounter, the real drama was packaged into the concluding minutes, a period that featured an early contender for miss of the season as Albion forward Ishmael Miller ran in unopposed to meet a shot from team-mate Do-Heon Kim that had rebounded off the Bolton bar and into his path.</p> <p>Perhaps Miller had too long to think about how to convert what looked a goal because keeper Jussi Jaaskelainen recovered to block the headed attempt.</p> <p>'I'm disappointed,' said Mowbray of the Miller miss. 'But Ishmael is getting into positions and he just needs one to go in. He's disappointed but he's confident, he'll keep going.</p> <p>'This team will score goals.

But we withstood their bombardment and, at times, still played our football.'</p> <p>Certainly, what 'football' there was on display came from the visitors, although, fortunately for them, Bolton are without injured Swedish forward Johan Elmander for the next month. With a more natural finisher in attack, Bolton might well have turned possession and pressure into goals.</p> <p>Kevin Nolan should probably have been sent off in the first half after a high lunge on Leon Barnett, and a flowing Albion passing move, involving Kim, James Morrison and Paul Robinson, ended with Jaaskelainen saving well from Borja Valero.</p> <p>But it was not until the hour mark, when Bolton won a free-kick on the edge of the area for a Robinson foul on Ricardo Gardner whose free-kick was superbly saved by Scott Carson, that the game really came to life.</p> <p>Within a minute of Miller's miss, Jonathan Greening was ruled to have handled just outside the area, despite Bolton's protests that it was inside, and Riga's free-kick curled just wide.</p> <p>The home team's mood was not eased by Carson denying Nolan with another great block and Kevin Davies, correctly, being judged offside as he 'scored' from the rebound - a feat the forward would repeat with a further offside 'goal' before the final whistle.</p> <p>The closing seconds also saw Miller, who missed an 82nd-minute shooting opportunity from a Morrison pass, launch a counter attack down the left that concluded with Andy O'Brien clearing Sherjill MacDonald's shot.</p> <p>'Territorially, we had most of the game though West Brom were dangerous on the break,' said Bolton manager Gary Megson.

Neither side were particularly good but if West Brom had had a decent striker we would have been 5-0 down by half-time. We started the game with four battlers in midfield and we were crying out for a little creativity. Hoofing the ball forward to Kevin Davies every game is not the answer and if we continue to play this way we won't last long this season. The fact our best player was keeper Jaaskelainen says all you need to know about this frustratingly dull game. It's no wonder the stadium was half-empty today.

We earned a point, but we should have won three really. In terms of chances, Albion always looked the most likely to score, but what let us down yet again was the lack of a proven striker - unless this is rectified we will continue to struggle.

  "<p>As Republicans gather in St Paul for this week's convention, the choice of Alaska governor Sarah Palin as John McCain's running mate has highlighted one of the key themes of the next 10 weeks' campaigning: the chase for the female voter.</p> <p>Palin's nomination is aimed at exploiting a perceived weakness in the Democratic camp, where millions of supporters of Hillary Clinton's doomed run for the nomination might be open to switching sides.</p> <p>A mother of five and religious conservative, Palin made a deliberate pitch for women in her acceptance speech at an introductory rally in Ohio, noting the proximity of the 88th anniversary of women's suffrage in America. Then she heaped praise upon the first woman to appear on a major party national presidential ticket - Democrat Geraldine Ferraro in 1984 - and also Clinton. She praised her 'determination and grace' in her campaign against Barack Obama then borrowed one of Clinton's most powerful lines: 'Hillary left 18 million cracks in the highest, hardest glass ceiling in America.'</p> <p>Palin then cast her own nomination firmly in the light of women's rights, following on from the ground broken by Ferraro and Clinton. 'It turns out the women of America aren't finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all,' she said.</p> <p>It remains unclear how successful the ploy will be. Last week at the Democratic convention in Denver the Obama campaign was itself careful to woo former Clinton voters, especially women. The effort was aided by Clinton herself, who gave a strong speech backing Obama and attacking McCain. </p> <p>Certainly the issues alone would seem to suggest that Palin will have a tough time persuading wavering Democratic women on to her side. She is a staunch evangelical Christian who is firmly anti-abortion, even in extreme cases. </p> <p>She is pro-gun and is a lifelong hunter and member of the conservative National Rifle Association. She is in favour of drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve in Alaska, a hot-button topic condemned by many environmentalists. She also opposes gay marriage and is sympathetic to teaching creationist theories alongside evolution in schools. </p> <p>However, Republicans are betting that Palin's life story will be fertile ground to make a pitch for women, especially the suburban 'soccer moms' who have proven a key demographic in recent elections. Palin began her speech in Ohio - the first time many Americans had even heard of the obscure governor - by saying she had been 'just your average hockey mom in Alaska'. Her history as a hardworking mother of five children, one of whom has Down's syndrome, is also seen as a potentially powerful message to women voters.</p> <p>Palin is set to hit the campaign trail hard, stumping for McCain and highlighting her own unlikely rise to the summit of Republican politics. Whatever the potential for success in her appeal to women voters, she has already sparked great expectation among activists. </p> <p>Her youth, her former beauty queen looks and the sheer surprise of her choice has created a buzz in a party that has had trouble generating much excitement. 'It was very, very clever. It was a bold and exciting choice,' said Republican strategist Angela Marie Buchanan.</p> <p>Palin's conservative views have also addressed one of the key problems McCain has faced in recent months as he has secured his party's nomination. The religious right has long distrusted him, despite his own social conservatism. Picking Palin will go a long way to ensuring conservatives turn out in large numbers for McCain. That in itself is vital as they make up a large amount of the party's most committed activists who are key to any 'get out the vote' operation on election day itself. </p> <p>The move prompted James Dobson, founder of the evangelical group Focus on the Family, to heap praise on the choice. Dobson, who initially said he would not vote for McCain, called Palin 'an outstanding choice.' </p> <p>He added that it would help evangelicals back McCain as it made it likely that he would appoint conservatives to the Supreme Court, something that would increase the chance of making abortion illegal.</p>",

'We believe no other town of a similar size could match Helensburgh for talent.'</p> <p>No association is too tenuous to prevent acceptance as a son or daughter of the town, along with a bronze star on its esplanade. Charles Rennie Mackintosh, the Scottish architect, is included because he designed Hill House on Helensburgh's outskirts. Bonar Law, the Canadian-born Tory who succeeded David Lloyd George but held office for just seven months, married there. WH Auden, who briefly taught at the Larchfield School - as did former Poet Laureate Cecil Day-Lewis - is forgiven despite writing of Helensburgh's reputation as 'a snob town'. Emma Sanderson, the first British woman and youngest person to finish the Around Alone, a solo round-the-world yacht race, lived in the town as a child and competed in dinghy world championships. </p> <p>'Not everyone on the roll of honour was born here, but when we drew up the list we included people who were either from here or were living here at the time they were going through their meteoric rise to fame and fortune,' explained Worms. 'The only one who is possibly contentious is Mackintosh. But although he wasn't born or lived in Helensburgh, the town is forever associated with one of the best examples of his work.'</p> <p>Others are hardly household names. But veterinary parasitologist George Urquhart and mathematician Horatio Carslaw were, no doubt, giants in their field. </p> <p>The point of Helensburgh Heroes, Worms says, is to pay homage to all who have achieved recognition, while raising civic pride and encouraging regeneration. The \u00a328,000 Walk of Fame is just one thought. Another is for a movie-themed diner in honour of Kerr and Jack Buchanan, Britain's answer to Fred Astaire. Kerr was born in the town, though she went to boarding school in Bristol; Buchanan left for Glasgow aged 12. 'The diner could contain memorabilia from Helensburgh film stars,' Worms said. Sir William Jackson Hooker, who became director of Kew Gardens, could be commemorated with a botanic garden, he added. </p> <p>Tristram Hunt, historian and broadcaster, said he 'applauded' Helensburgh's attempts to put itself on the map. 'We should salute the idea and wish them well,' he said. But he cautioned that some of the links seemed tenuous. 'Where it works is in places like Kirkcaldy with Adam Smith [economic philosopher], or the radical Thomas Paine and Lewes in East Sussex,' he said. 'Or Philip Larkin and Hull. They are examples of places having very strong credible links - a proper connection... rather than just a list of people who briefly passed through, or had a house, or went on holiday there.' </p> <p>Meanwhile, Worms is intent on making it happen. 'It would be great if road signs could be put up on the A82 into the town reading: \"Helensburgh - Home of Heroes\",' he said.</p> <h2>Helensburgh's heroes</h2> <p>John Logie Baird - inventor of the TV </p> <p>Deborah Kerr - actress </p> <p>Henry Bell - engineer</p> <p>Andrew Bonar Law - Prime Minister, 1922-23</p> <p>WH Auden - poet and writer</p> <p>Helen McInnes - novelist </p> <p>AJ Cronin - novelist</p> <p>Emma Sanderson - youngest person to sail around the world alone, in 2002-03 </p> <p>Cecil Day-Lewis - Poet Laureate from 1968 to 1972</p>",
  "<p>The government has warned British Muslims embarking on the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia this year to be on their guard against scams and rip-offs. Up to 50,000 Britons make the pilgrimage each year, but ministers have become concerned with the growing problem of unscrupulous travel agents cashing in on religious devotion. </p> <p>Hotel and flight deals can cost more than \u00a33,000, and every year hundreds fall victim to a variety of scams: paying for a five-star hotel near the Masjid al-Haram (the mosque that is a focal point of the event), but getting a tiny room far from the centre of Mecca; visas and flight tickets not arriving; and in extreme cases agents disappearing with their money.</p> <p>Consumer affairs minister Gareth Thomas convened a conference of travel agents, community groups and consumer organisations last month, and told them that the government aimed to 'help pilgrims avoid booking with rogue travel agents, and to get redress when they fall foul of those who break the law'. </p> <p>The Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform is planning a poster campaign in community centres and mosques aimed at improving awareness of consumer rights, and stressing the need to check that a tour operator to December's Hajj holds an Air Travel Organiser's Licence (Atol), that any company booked with is a member of a trade organisation such as Abta and to keep all documents such as contracts and invoices in case of later problems.</p> <p>One of the groups that flagged up the problem, the Association of British Hujjaj, welcomed the move, saying the 'vast majority' of Hajj travel operators were one-man operations and 'simply opportunists who are looking for monetary gain by taking advantage of the vulnerable'. Last year, it handed a petition signed by 5,000 Hajj travellers to the government.</p> <p>Dr Nadim Nayyar, from Liversedge in West Yorkshire, booked last year through a Luton-based firm, Go4 Hajj. His party of nine paid for a luxury package costing \u00a332,000. Just 48 hours before they were due to depart, Nayyar discovered their Saudi Arabian visas had not been obtained by the company. 'Our Hajj was over. I felt totally devastated,' he said. </p> <p>'The pre-Hajj seminar, where we were supposed to meet other travellers, kept on getting delayed. Then we found that our flights had been altered from scheduled to chartered, changing in Bahrain. Then we found out they couldn't get the five-star hotels they had promised, and we were being downgraded.'</p> <p>After learning that their trip was cancelled, Nayyar and 60 other pilgrims who had been let down were told the firm had no assets left to refund them, although he eventually recovered his money through Go4 Hajj's Atol cover. </p> <p>'This is not just a package holiday, but an obligatory religious visit, so people tend to be far too trusting,' said Nayyar. 'I think that's where we fell down.'</p>",
  "<p>The Who's The Kids Are Alright twinkled over the PA system as Arsenal came out to play. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger must sometimes think the rest of the world does not believe him. After all, this was a week that started with his team chastised - rightly - for a rotten-tomato performance. Then he had to speak out against the jeers aimed at his main goalscorer, and all the while the fans have been panicking about whether or not he will sign an experienced midfielder before the window is locked until January.</p> <p>For 90 minutes, the best part of 60,000 disciples forgot about their worries and their strife, and believed. There were some hearty boos towards the end, but they were directed exclusively at Joey Barton, who made his first appearance on a football pitch since he was released from prison. Kevin Keegan made an impassioned defence of his unloved player afterwards - he felt compelled to tick off Samir Nasri, who put in a retribution tackle on Barton which raised the temperature in the away dugout.</p> <p>Typical Barton. Two minutes on the pitch and he managed to spice up an afternoon that had previously been devoid of too much tension. Until then it was a simple story of Arsenal enjoying themselves immensely against a Newcastle team who accepted they were second-best without too much resistance. Mike Ashley summed up the feeling of most in the visiting section midway through the second half when he downed a pint and shook his head in disbelief.</p> <p>They were well below the standard that earned them a point at Old Trafford on the opening weekend of the season. As Keegan pointed out, even the best teams have key players and Arsenal had Cesc F\u00e1bregas here, while Manchester United missed their kingpin Cristiano Ronaldo.</p> <p>To Arsenal's relief, it was not just F\u00e1bregas who was back. Emmanuel Adebayor and Robin van Persie, who had played like shadows in the first two games of the season, both rediscovered their mojo. Van Persie scored twice and caught the eye. Adebayor worked tirelessly and unselfishly, and the quality of his performance won over the section of the crowd who had been on his back.</p> <p>Supported by a midfield who functioned beautifully, this was easy-on-the-eye Arsenal. Cocksure and brimming with invention, they would have conjured a more substantial scoreline had Shay Given not given a shot-stopping masterclass in the Newcastle goal. The only downside for Arsenal was Van Persie hobbling off the pitch just as he had worked the crowd into a state resembling a mass love-in. 'He went for an X-ray to check on his ankle. Hopefully nothing is broken,' said Wenger.</p> <p>What Van Persie dearly needs is a run of matches to gain the kind of sharpness that two injury-ravaged seasons have destroyed. An 18th-minute penalty served up the perfect opportunity for him to find his range, after Charles N'Zogbia handled Adebayor's cross. Van Persie's penalty kick was immaculate. It fizzed past Given and landed, unsaveably, inside the side netting.</p> <p>Keegan's team were on the rack. And yet Newcastle should have equalised in the 37th minute. When Jon\u00e1s Guti\u00e9rrez cantered down the right flank, Arsenal's centre-backs were befuddled by the cross, which fell to Michael Owen. Unfortunately for the England forward, Shola Ameobi ambled into his way to deflect a goalbound shot. His frustration was plain. With Fabio Capello in the stands, the most prolific striker available to England was otherwise starved of service.</p> <p>Capello watched two Africans combine crisply to scythe Newcastle apart for Arsenal's second. Emmanuel Ebou\u00e9 linked with Adebayor and crowned one of his better displays with a sharp backheel for Van Persie to belt the ball past Given. Newcastle threatened only briefly after the break when Nicky Butt steered a header against the crossbar and Danny Guthrie shot from distance.</p> <p>Arsenal struck back and Newcastle's rearguard were shredded by the nimble combination play of Adebayor, Nasri and Denilson, who tapped in his first ever Premier League goal. It was a goal of the style Wenger cherishes. He rose to applaud like a proud father. Van Persie earned a standing ovation with a strike of ridiculous audacity - from no more than a step or two inside the byline. But that was to be his final action, before disappearing with one of those dreaded knocks. 'It was a complete performance,' enthused Wenger afterwards.</p> <p>Keegan was left analysing how much room there is for improvement. 'I've got seven-and-a-half good players here and some maybes and could-bes,' he assessed. Ever the optimist, he is hoping to sign three more players before tomorrow night.</p> <p><strong>THE FANS' PLAYER RATINGS AND VERDICTS</strong></p> <p><strong>Ben Lover, Observer reader</strong></p> <p>You could not get a greater contrast to last week against Fulham. Right from the start the players were really up for it; there was the urgency missing from the game at Craven Cottage. We were dominant throughout, the vast majority of the game was played in the Newcastle half. It was great to have F\u00e1bregas back, Van Persie was a constant threat and looks to be getting back to his sharpest, while Clichy was superb. Gallas was criticised after last week but had no problems against a Newcastle attack that put him under no pressure at all. Even Adebayor was not booed - he put in the effort, ran around alot and people are starting to get behind him again. I'm sure it will all be soon forgetten.</p> <p><strong>The fans' player ratings</strong> Almunia 7; Sagna 7, Tour\u00e9 8, Gallas 7, Clichy 9; Ebou\u00e9 8 (Walcott 7), Fabregas 8, Denilson 7 (Song 7), Nasri 8; Van Persie 9 (Vela 8), Adebayor 8</p> <p><strong>Steve Cole, <a href=\"http://www.nufc-london.com\">NUFC-London.com</a></strong></p> <p>It just highlighted the gulf in class that exists in the Premier League. We were barely in it at all and hardly had a shot on target. With our record at Arsenal I didn't go with any great expectations but it easily could have been four or five. Shay Given made two or three good saves and could not be faulted for the goals, and I thought the penalty was a bit harsh, but the rest were just outclassed. Mike Ashley was sat just along from me and plenty of people wanted to 'debate' the decision to sell Milner with him but were hustled away. It was not a popular move - as was bringing on Joey Barton right at the end. I hoped never to see him in a Newcastle shirt again. We should have paid him off, no matterwhat it cost. </p> <p><strong>The fans' player ratings</strong> Given 8; Beye 6 (Edgar n/a), Taylor 7, Coloccini 6, Enrique 5 (Bassong 5); Gutierrez 7 (Barton n/a), Butt 5, Guthrie 6, N'Zogbia 6; Ameobi 4, Owen 6</p> <p><strong><em>To take part in the Verdict, email fans@observer.co.uk</em></strong></p>",
  "<p>orbidding red-brick estates line the streets. Children choose their routes nervously round here, knowing that there are certain flats, families, corners of gang territory best avoided. Yet in front of me walk three girls, impeccably turned out in what appears to be the uniform of a posh private school: grey blazers with red piping, neat skirts and black tights. They look affluent and confident as they turn through the gates of their school, a low-rise palace of wood and glass, splashed with primary colours.</p> <p>But this is not a posh private school, although it was designed by the Richard Rogers Partnership: 40 per cent of children here are on free school meals, 35 per cent are on the special needs register and 55 of those are statemented, meaning that they have the most severe problems. The surrounding area is so rough that teachers escort the children on to buses at the end of the day and patrol the streets in pairs.</p> <p>The school is Mossbourne Community Academy in Hackney, east London, one of the first of a new type of educational institution to open in Britain, and in the vanguard of a controversial attempt to galvanise state education by removing schools from local authority control. Forty-seven new academies will open their doors this week, bringing the total across the country to 130. The government intends that a further 100 will open in the next two years. </p> <p>An academy is an independent school within the state system, backed by a sponsor who - if an individual or business, rather than a university or school - puts up \u00a32m towards the capital costs (almost all academies are in brand new buildings). The running costs are supplied by central government at the same level as for any state school, although they include the sum that a local authority would 'top-slice' to fund facilities shared between its schools. The sponsor has the power to appoint governors and oversee the curriculum.</p> <p>The academies' many critics object that they are unaccountable locally. They say that they threaten to create a two-tier system of education, and that if the early versions have been successful it is mainly because they have had vast amounts of money and government attention lavished on them. They point to high rates of exclusion, which seem to suggest academies may only be prepared to teach certain pupils. And they worry about sponsors' jurisdiction over the curriculum: a couple of high-profile sponsors are evangelical Christians.</p> <p>They should be worrying, although they have made much less of this, about sponsors' roles in the design of school buildings. A number of academy backers are so in thrall to the idea of schools-like-businesses and, perhaps, to their starry architects (who include Zaha Hadid and Norman Foster as well as Rogers) that they have signed off buildings with no outdoor play space, inadequate dining halls and nowhere for the whole school to gather. </p> <p>I visited one academy, designed by Foster and Partners, on a sunny day when all the walkways (the place is way too modern for corridors) were lit by electric light. The Thomas Deacon Academy in Peterborough has cost \u00a350m to date: the principal, Alan McMurdo, says the final bill still isn't in. Following protests from the children about the lack of play space, there are now benches outside, but the dining room is still too small. There are no bells, which McMurdo presents as a positive, educational choice, but he couldn't possibly have all 2,200 children moving around the school together. </p> <p>Critics also object that the academy programme is intellectually incoherent: if independence over budgets, governance and curriculum is such a great thing, why not give it to all schools? And they question the motivation of sponsors, who, for an outlay of around \u00a31.2m when tax benefits are taken into account (against average new-build costs of between \u00a325m and \u00a330m, all supplied by the government) get their hands on a vanity project - a school they can name after themselves and run as they like. It did not help the academies' cause that in April 2006, Des Smith, a council member of the Specialist Schools and Academies Trust, was caught out telling a journalist that honours could be lined up for backers. Smith was promptly disowned by the SSAT.</p> <p>But academies seem unstoppable. David Cameron launched his schools policy at Mossbourne. It is widely believed that Tony Blair exacted a promise from Gordon Brown that the manifesto commitment to 200 academies by 2010 and subsequent decision to enlarge that number to 400 would be honoured. Mossbourne is the school that is said to have persuaded Brown to agree.</p> <p>Inside this school, apparently the most popular in Britain - at least with politicians - the atmosphere is not what you might expect of a state secondary school in a challenging area. Clearly, it's nothing like that of the school that once stood on this site, the notorious Hackney Downs, once branded the worst school in Britain and one of the first to be shut in the school closures programme. There is an air of calm purposefulness here, and palpable success.</p> <p>Mossbourne is the top school in the country for value-added results. If the Key Stage 3 results at age 14 feed through into GCSEs, which the school's first cohort will take this year, 80 per cent of pupils should get 5 A*-Cs. The principal, Sir Michael Wilshaw, insists this is not because the school massages its intake. Children are banded according to ability and those who live closest to the school in each band are given priority.</p> <p>Mossbourne does not exercise its right to select 10 per cent of its pupils on ability. Wilshaw introduces me in the corridor to a boy who scored nothing at all in his Sats at primary school and two years later is achieving level 4, the national average. 'My central purpose,' Wilshaw says, 'is to show you can take children from poor backgrounds, with low prior attainment, and make them succeed.'</p> <p>At Mossbourne, teachers do this through intensive work with children who are lagging behind. In a 'nurture' group of Year 8s (aged 12-13), there is one teacher to 15 pupils, plus three teaching assistants. </p> <p>Mossbourne pupils are on a tight leash. A teacher (they all seem mysteriously young and good-looking here) stands at the school gates in the morning, correcting minor infractions of uniform before pupils are allowed to enter. I have never seen a school where the uniform is worn so exactingly. Staff stand on the stairs between lessons, watching the pupils move up and down. Minor offences such as rudeness to a teacher mean staying behind until 6pm to be taught by one of the senior staff and then being collected by a parent. For worse offences, children come to school on Saturday.</p> <p>A week after I first went to Mossbourne, I returned for a concert. The standard was high, but the event was also inclusive (some of the school's 19 autistic children were involved). The music was divided into pop, soul, world and swing, and there was dancing, including a conga in which the principal participated. So it's strict, but not stuffy. Wilshaw claims that once parents realise the methods are working they don't object to the discipline. The staff have no hours-contract, as they do in most state schools; they are, however, better paid. The day I visited, they'd just been told they were getting a 20 per cent results-linked bonus.</p> <p>The government has invested a huge amount of hope in Mossbourne, and similar schools. When Unity City Academy in Middlesbrough went into special measures, not long after being formed by the amalgamation of two predecessor schools, central government gave it \u00a36m to sort itself out and parachuted in a proven management team. When I ask the principal at Unity City, Bob Dore, if this would have happened in any other kind of school, he says, 'It would depend on the local authority.' No, then.</p> <p>So academies are getting more attention and, in some cases, more money. There's nothing to stop sponsors writing cheques beyond their \u00a32m initial outlay, and they're free to raise funds through their networks. When Wilshaw walks me through the theatre at Mossbourne, he says casually that his sponsor, Sir Clive Bourne, 'got a mate' to pay for the beautiful, retractable red-raked seating. An academy like Mossbourne would be an attractive proposition to donors, combining success with being seen to be doing something about deprivation.</p> <p>Yet where new academies are proposed, there is often extreme hostility, not least from teaching unions. A few days after visiting Mossbourne I went to Barrow-in-Furness to witness a protest against the amalgamation of three existing schools into an academy. The demonstration was directed at the schools minister, Lord Adonis, who had been visiting.</p> <p>As a young tyke at Tony Blair's Number 10 Policy Unit, Andrew Adonis was the architect of the academies programme. Now ennobled and a schools minister, he had earlier that day met two of the four Barrow borough councillors recently elected on the 'Our Schools Are Not For Sale' ticket. They told him 6,000 people in a town of 60,000 had signed a petition against the proposed academy. Some of the objectors are ideologically opposed to what they see as the privatisation of state education; others are worried more practically about an overflow of children who won't get into the new academy, fearing it will create a sink school nearby.</p> <p>This gets to the heart of concerns about academies. They seem, so far, to be working - not all as spectacularly as Mossbourne, but much better than most of the struggling inner-city schools they replaced. The question is, at what cost? There are persistent stories of high rates of exclusion at academies; fears that, in journalist and education campaigner Fiona Millar's words, 'the freedom they have been given is the freedom to engineer a more favourable context for education by taking the most easily educable and excluding the difficult'.</p> <p>Academy enthusiasts insist education isn't a zero sum game; in showing how results and behaviour can be improved, they argue, academies establish a path for other schools to follow. Only time will tell whether they have this galvanising effect. As stand-alone schools, though, there doesn't seem to be much incentive for them to share their secrets with others in their area, especially as they are in competition with them for applications. (Mossbourne had 1,400 applications for 180 places last year; a lot of children in Hackney will be going to a school that was their second choice.)</p> <p>When I put this concern about divisiveness to Adonis, he says Mossbourne and Hackney are a good example of his contention that academies can lead to a general improvement. Schools across Hackney have become more popular in the past five years: fewer children are leaving the borough for their secondary education, and the three academies that are now up and running (there are two more in development) have played an important part in that. (The other factor has been outsourcing the running of education in the borough to Cambridge Educational Associates, who should probably claim quite a lot of the credit.) 'I think I'm right in saying when I last looked at the statistics,' says Adonis, 'that the perception in Hackney is that secondary education has been transformed and the impact of the academies has been positive.'</p> <p>The mistake that the anti-academies lobbyists often make is to treat all academies as if they were the same and, in particular, to imply that they are proto-grammar schools, offering a superior sort of education to a handful of children. What you quickly realise from visiting a few of them is that they are as individual and particular as any other schools. The circumstances they face, though generally difficult, are very different. The question then becomes whether their independence allows them to respond better.</p> <p>Unity City Academy in Middlesbrough serves one of the areas of greatest deprivation in Europe: a white working-class area (very different from Mossbourne's multi-ethnic community) where it is now not unusual for families to have seen four generations of unemployment. There is little interest in education: when Ofsted sent out 1,100 questionnaires to Unity parents, it got eight back. More than a third of pupils have special needs, and principal Bob Dore claims many have never seen a beach, although they live only 10 miles from the sea. A substantial proportion have never made it into the town centre. At the age of five, the children on the local estate have the highest rate of fillings in Britain.</p> <p>Unlike Mossbourne, Unity City Academy was formed out of two existing schools. The sponsors are Amey plc, project managers in public service; given their background, it is astonishing that the school - which even Adonis admits 'was not a well-managed building project' - is so poorly designed. Only 44 per cent of the building was originally given over to classrooms. The rest, Dore says, 'was for show'. </p> <p>For some reason, the building was designed to resemble a Tuscan village - though, actually, you need to be told this. One side of the sports hall backs on to classrooms, which shudder when balls hit its walls; the other adjoins music rooms. There were high and treacherous balconies - very enticing to disaffected or bored pupils, especially ones, as here, with no outside play space. The original dining room was absurdly small. Nor does anything else seem to have been particularly well managed: the school had had three previous heads and was in special measures by the time the Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF) parachuted in David Triggs, the extremely successful principal of Greensward College in Essex, and now the executive head of five schools.</p> <p>Triggs became CEO of Unity, and nine months later brought Dore in as principal. The two men had worked together on preparing two schools to amalgamate into the John Madejski Academy in Reading, and both live in Essex: Dore is a weekly commuter and Triggs works on Unity business three days a month. </p> <p>Some of their \u00a36m windfall went on making the building fit for purpose, or fitter - a number of classrooms still have no windows. The rest went on turning a separate block of 17 classrooms into a new East Middlesbrough Technology Centre, which will this week start offering qualifications in hairdressing and beauty, car maintenance, construction, digital media, engineering, catering and horticulture to students from Unity and beyond.</p> <p>The term before the new team arrived there were 4,000 exclusion days. The Technology Centre, with its emphasis on vocational education, has been designed to make education more appealing to those who might otherwise fail to see the point of it. The school has also employed dedicated pastoral staff with a background in social services (in some other schools, ex-police officers have filled this role) who go and find children when they don't turn up, and take parents to buy washing machines to keep uniforms clean.</p> <p>In the two years since Dore arrived the school has changed a fair bit, although he would say not yet enough. The first thing he and his colleagues did after building a bigger dining hall was teach the children how to queue. There were previously no school trips: last year there were 54, including one to Kenya. The level of crime and the number of Asbos in the area have fallen. Triggs and Dore have permanently excluded three pupils, but 35 who might otherwise have gone are in a special unit down the road, where they don't wear uniform and follow personalised vocational training.</p> <p>I talk to three girls who are leaving at 16 to go on to sixth-form college. One of them expects to get 13 good GCSEs and they're all intending to go to university. But they are exceptional. The pupils' scores when they arrive predict that only 17 per cent will have even a 37 per cent chance of getting five A*-Cs at GCSE. Improving results will be a struggle. But at least most pupils are getting out of bed to come in now and parents are gradually becoming interested. </p> <p>Some of the anti-academies people like to sneer that schools such as Unity are simply recreating the old secondary moderns. They would, however, probably be the first to argue that education is about more than results. If vocational education offers children an alternative to persistent, apparently hopeless unemployment, then it has to be a good thing. </p> <p>None of what Unity is doing is unique. Like other academies, and indeed other well-led schools, it cherry-picks good ideas from elsewhere. I ask Dore what it is about being an academy, aside from the \u00a36m, that has allowed him to get as far as he has, and he doesn't really have an answer. 'It would have taken much longer at a local authority school,' he says. 'There would have been a lot of forms to fill in.'</p> <p>In fact, reading between the lines, the sponsors here seem to have been of limited help. They commissioned an unsuitable building and couldn't keep a head teacher. When Triggs was brought in by the DCSF, the Amey-appointed board of governors was also changed. Three Amey staff members, of whom Dore speaks highly, continued to represent the company, although when I visited the school one of them had left Amey and his place on the governing board had not yet been filled. This looks, at best, rather offhand. (No one from Amey would speak to me directly, although a month after I initially approached the company, the managing director supplied a rather general statement which spoke of 'challenges', 'four years of continuous improvements' and 'confidence in the board's ability to build on this good work', but didn't answer the key points about the terrible building, the succession of heads, or the delay in filling the board vacancy.)</p> <p>The funding agreement between a sponsor and the DCSF is a seven-year rolling contract which could in theory be terminated at any time. But David Wolfe, a barrister at Matrix Chambers and an expert on academies, says the grounds for doing this are very limited. A sponsor couldn't, for example, be removed if an academy failed to meet Ed Balls's National Challenge of getting at least 30 per cent of pupils five A*-C GCSEs, including English and maths.</p> <p>Sponsors are also a cause for concern insofar as they can dictate the curriculum. There have been persistent worries that evangelical Christians like Sir Peter Vardy, with his Emmanuel Schools Trust (three schools in the north of England), or Robert Edmiston, with one academy open and another in development in the Midlands, have too much control over what is taught and, in particular, that they promote creationism. The Royal Society was concerned enough about the Emmanuel Schools Trust to issue a rare protest. 'Creationism,' it pointed out crisply, 'is not consistent with the wealth of evidence for evolution, such as the fossil record. Similarly, a belief that the Earth was formed in 4004BC is not consistent with the evidence from geology, astronomy and physics.' </p> <p>Gordon Brown and Ed Balls have now changed the rules to require academies to follow the national curriculum in the core subjects of maths, English and science. Adonis says independent control of the curriculum is in practice an ability to add on rather than reduce, and dismisses anxieties about the teaching of creationism: 'Ofsted has not found concerns about the teaching of science. The schools which have been most criticised by fundamentalist secularists have without exception been praised for the quality of education they are offering. And parents are queueing up to send their children to those schools.'</p> <p>So how do the rest of the charges against academies stand up? Alasdair Smith of the Anti Academies Alliance objects that they lack democratic accountability. This is fair enough, but it's doubtful that many parents feel they have any democratic control over non-academy schools. Governors' meetings at council-run schools are often bogged down in bureaucracy, while local representation can mean little more than activists playing out politics at the level of the school. The objection also misses the point that academies usually replace local authority schools that were struggling and unpopular. </p> <p>The programme does, though, seem to be intellectually inconsistent: if independence is so marvellous, why not give it to all schools? Adonis's response is that that's where he's heading: he envisages all 3,500 secondary schools 'moving towards greater autonomy and greater engagement with external partners ... The academies are at the leading edge of a trend that's been spreading across the whole state system. What do I expect to see happen? Progressively more schools having progressively more independence, and local authorities increasingly becoming commissioners of education, rather than providers.'</p> <p>As far as exclusions are concerned, academy principals claim that the figures are skewed by the difficulties of amalgamating schools, but are not out of line with what might be expected in the first year, and that they quickly settle down. It remains to be seen whether the numbers do indeed settle. Much else about academies will also only be clear after some time. Thomas Deacon Academy, for example, has been formed from three schools, one of which - Deacon's - was highly desirable, while the others were less successful. Some 50 per cent of the pupils came from Deacon's and inevitably their dominance has affected the atmosphere. The new academy doesn't, for example, play football, because Deacon's had a fixture list against public schools and that, the director of sport says, grandly, 'lends itself to rugby and hockey'.</p> <p>I am shown around by sixth-formers who enthuse about their International Baccalaureate courses, their spanking new building, the enormous numbers of computers, the amount of information that now comes to them by email, the extent of student representation and the range of activities on offer once school officially finishes at 2.30pm. They are charming, articulate and thoughtful. It turns out that they were all previously at Deacon's. Perhaps it will only be fair to judge the new academy when it's educating children from 11 to 18.</p> <p>The only reasonable conclusion to draw from looking at a range of academies is that they're not homogeneous. They are affected by variables common to all schools - the quality of the management, the attitude and ability of the pupils and teachers - and by other things that don't apply elsewhere, like the involvement of their sponsor. At the moment, they are benefiting from new buildings and the feelings of specialness that the infrastructural investment implies. But the buildings won't be cutting-edge forever. Anyway, it is possible to have a brilliantly run school in scruffy buildings and a badly run one in a celebrity architect's dream. Relationships matter much more.</p> <p>Some local authority schools have done radical things, such as setting up computers in thousands of pupils' homes, without troubling themselves to become academies. Taking on academy status may well allow heads and governors to move faster. Is that likely to have an adverse effect on other schools in the vicinity? Unless you think there is only so much success to go around (in which case you might as well give up on the education of all but a few) there's no necessity for it to do so, especially if academies are open about the secrets of their success. But the omens are not good: Britain has a grim history of divisiveness in education. </p> <p>The government, it seems, sees academies partly as a means of jolting schools out of a torpid culture in which failure has become acceptable. 'It is an almost invariable rule,' Adonis tells me, 'that the greater the controversy over the setting up of an academy the more popular it is when it opens. That doesn't surprise me, because controversies are often driven by very strong local vested interests, and they tend to exist where educational standards are lowest and there's most to fear from the arrival of an academy.'</p> <p>There are many dedicated and innovative teachers outside academies, and academies are far from being a universal panacea. To be really good they need, like any school, to offer inspiring leadership, to be efficiently managed, and to pay very close attention to all their pupils. Academy status can't guarantee those things, although it may make them more likely, not least because the government has too much at stake to let any academies fail. Adonis and Ed Balls cannot, though, be expected to pay the attention that the early academies have had to all 3,500 secondary schools, let alone the primary schools now increasingly being talked about as candidates for independence, perhaps as part of all-through academies. Sponsors - universities and federations of branded schools in particular - will become even more important. The message may well be to pick your sponsor carefully.</p> <p>In the end, the positions of the pro- and anti-academy lobbyists were summed up for me by two teachers. The first, Carmel Totman, is an English teacher at Mossbourne. 'I have a lot of arguments with teacher friends about the fact I work here,' she says. 'They say it's elitist. But we take children of all backgrounds and abilities and have very high expectations of them. We don't make excuses on the basis of background or culture.' </p> <p>The other was David York, branch secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers and an organiser of the anti-academy protest in Barrow-in-Furness. I asked him whether he thought an academy might not boost the results of the children who currently attend the least successful school in the town. 'You have to ask yourself why some children aren't getting five A*-Cs at GCSE,' he said. 'Some are just not capable of doing that.' Regardless of who I was, or where I came from, I know who I'd rather have teaching my kids.</p>",
  "<p>THE TWO women seemed like captured war trophies. Debra Bartoshevich and Cynthia Ruccia were both former supporters of Hillary Clinton's campaign. Now they were backing John McCain. In front of the TV cameras at a Republican press conference in Denver last week, they were introduced by Carly Fiorina, a top McCain aide and a possible vice-presidential choice before he settled on Alaska governor Sarah Palin.</p> <p>Both women were vociferous in their support of McCain and slammed Barack Obama for - in their opinion - abusing America's female vote. 'The [Democratic] party is allowing 51 per cent of the country to be bashed,' said Ruccia, a Clinton supporter and Democratic official from Ohio. Bartoshevich, once a Clinton delegate from Wisconsin, went even further. She is now the star of a Republican 'attack ad' appealing for Clinton supporters to abandon Obama. 'I have spoken to a lot of Democrats who are the same as I am. But they are not ready to come out,' she said. She added that she was going public to encourage them to jump ship too. 'I want others to feel that they can come out,' she said.</p> <p>That was music to the ears of Republican strategists and a worry for Democrats. Never before have women voters been so much the focus of concerted political attention. Clinton's sprawling, dramatic battle with Obama has put the female vote firmly in the headlines. By the end of the fight, Clinton had moulded herself into the unabashed champion of women, demanding that their voice be heard. Now Obama is scrambling to make sure those voters stay in his coalition. The surprise factor is that the Republicans have joined the chase and are aggressively pursuing the same target. McCain is heaping praise on Clinton and her achievements. Now he has picked a mother of five from Alaska as his running mate. Battle has been joined. The war for the women's vote could define the final two months of the election.</p> <p>In front of a cheering crowd in Dayton, Ohio, Palin herself left little doubt as to her role and intentions in the coming fight. In scenes unthinkable in a normal election year, the crowd witnessed the spectacle of the Republican vice-presidential choice lauding the achievements of Hillary Clinton. She praised Clinton's 'determination and grace' in her fight against Obama. The crowd seemed confused, with a few groans being muted by half-hearted cheers at Clinton's name.</p> <p>But Palin was not put off. She promptly stole one of Clinton's old stump speech lines. 'Hillary left 18 million cracks in the highest, hardest ceilings in America,' she said. Palin then cast herself firmly in the light of women's rights, following on from the ground broken by Clinton and Geraldine Ferraro, the 1984 Democratic pick for vice-president. 'It turns out the women of America aren't finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all,' she said.</p> <p>The pitch to bring in women on the McCain ticket was obvious. But it will be no easy task. Women in America are generally more sympathetic to a Democratic candidate. Recent polls have shown that six out of 10 women count themselves as Democrats or Democrat-leaning. In the latest Washington Post-ABC News poll, Obama attracted 55 per cent of the female support compared with McCain's 37 per cent. But Palin is not the only weapon in the Republican armoury. Figures like Fiorina - a former top businesswoman - have been increasingly visible in recent weeks. Then there is Cindy McCain, John McCain's wife and the potential next First Lady of America. With her demure attitude and blonde good looks, Cindy is wildly popular with traditional Republicans, superb at chatting to supporters in diners and coffee shops. 'She is a wonderful campaigner. People react to her,' said one Republican aide.</p> <p>It makes a contrast to her opposite number, Michelle Obama. A black lawyer with working class roots, she is from a world far removed from Cindy McCain's wealthy childhood in Arizona. Michelle is also at ease giving speeches but has a frank and fiery style. She is in many ways the archetype of the aspirational professional married woman and is a powerful draw to female voters.</p> <p>There is another side to Cindy McCain, one that reflects decades of travel to war-torn spots around the globe as part of her medical charity work. Recently, as her husband took a hawkish line on the Russian invasion of Georgia, it was his wife who popped up in a refugee camp in the aftermath of the country's short-lived war. 'My job in all of this is to make sure that the international community does not forget what is going on here,' she told reporters. Such comments did a lot to dispel the common notion of Republican First Ladies as 'Stepford Wives' adept only at lunches and buffets.</p> <p>Such developments pose a dilemma for the Obama camp. The campaign knows that it cannot afford to be complacent when it comes to female support. Palin in her speech steered clear of any ideological positions and instead touted her personal story as a mother of five. She called herself 'just your average hockey mom in Alaska' and emphasised her working-class background and that of her husband.</p> <p>But the Obama campaign has worked hard during the past week to shore up its support among women, especially the 18 million who backed Clinton. The effort was led by Clinton. She gave a speech in Denver attacking McCain and strongly supporting Obama. Much of the first three days of the convention was devoted to patching up publicly the divisions left over from the long nomination fight. A symbolic roll call included Clinton's name. It was stopped by Clinton herself, who then asked the convention to acclaim Obama the nominee. It was a powerful endorsement of his candidacy. Her husband, Bill Clinton, who has seemed lukewarm towards Obama, also made an impassioned plea for his election. Hillary then rejected recent Republican ads that have featured her criticising Obama.</p> <p>Certainly the former Hillary supporters promoted by the McCain campaign seemed to have trouble responding to policy questions about why they had switched sides. Ruccia, who confessed that she was pro-choice on abortion, is now supporting a Republican ticket on which both names are anti-abortionists. Bartoshevich is in the same position. 'I am not a one-topic voter. I take a look at other things,' she said. 'Things like the economy. I look at his [McCain's] experience in foreign policy.'</p> <p>That may be true. But to stop similar voters switching sides, the Obama camp believes that it will only have to emphasise Palin's red-blooded conservatism. Democratic strategists are betting that few women will be swayed by Palin once her opinions become widely known. She is a staunch opponent of abortion rights and a committed evangelical Christian. She is sympathetic to teaching creationist theories in schools. She is also a proponent of gun rights and a lifetime member of the National Rifle Association. It is unlikely that seeing Palin blasting away with a machine gun will persuade too many Democratic women voters that she is a genuine kindred spirit.</p> <p>But Palin does owe Clinton a huge debt. Her nomination for vice-president is a product of the campaign Clinton ran and the nerve it touched among millions of women across America. Just as Obama's run for office energised black Americans and young voters, Clinton's historic efforts triggered a political awakening among many women. That is what McCain is hoping to tap into by choosing Palin and by taking advantage of Obama's decision to pass over Clinton for his own running mate.</p> <p>Clinton's run for the White House was full of ironies. She began as favourite but ended as a scrappy, passionate underdog. The ultimate party insider, she became the voice for a downtrodden generation of Democratic women. In the end she may still achieve her goal of putting a woman in the White House, albeit as vice-president not commander-in-chief. Yet that woman will not be Hillary Rodham Clinton. It could instead be a gun-toting former beauty queen. In an election already replete with surprises, no one could have predicted that.</p>",
  "<p>Thousands of vulnerable pensioners in sheltered accommodation are struggling to adapt, as wardens are increasingly replaced by emergency alarms and 'floating' support workers, it is claimed. </p> <p>Campaigners are calling for an 'urgent review' amid fears that cost-cutting measures are causing 'confusion, upset and unrest' among many of the 400,000 elderly people living in sheltered homes.</p> <p>Help the Aged and Age Concern say they want an end to 'diluted, unstable and poorly co-ordinated services' which have resulted in the removal of many wardens who used to be responsible for sheltered units. Instead, many residents - one in five of whom is 85 or older - now rely on emergency alarm pendants and pull cords, with occasional visits from support workers.</p> <p>Joe Oldman, of Help the Aged, said it was unfair on residents who had opted for sheltered housing specifically because they wanted the security of having a warden available. 'It's not that we are [opposed to] assisted technologies. It's how they are used and how people are backed up,' he said. Budget cuts and recent changes to the way sheltered accommodation schemes were funded had contributed to the problem. Some providers had therefore replaced wardens with electronic aids and 'floating' support teams who only visit individuals on their check list. </p> <p>'There is something going badly wrong and it needs to be looked at,' said Oldman. In the private sector, wardens were being retained because that was what residents wanted. 'In the social sector, residents are told what they want and don't want - which is unacceptable.' Recent incidents have led to an increase in complaints over lack of support. In Derby, an inquest into the death of a 70-year-old woman was told that she had lain unconscious and undetected behind her sofa for several days before a neighbour found her. She was not wearing her emergency pendant and her warden had been removed.</p> <p>In Birmingham, a pensioner collapsed and died after returning from picking up a prescription because there was no one to do it for him. </p> <p>Critics say problems began in 2003 when the government introduced a complex funding formula. Residents used to pay a single sum for their accommodation and all services. Now they make two payments - one to their landlord for accommodation and one to a 'supporting people' team at their local council which provides visits. Each person is assessed according to needs. With not all residents requiring a warden, councils will instead provide 'floating' support personnel spread over several sheltered housing schemes.</p> <p>The trend away from resident wardens is partly due to European regulations on working hours and difficulties in recruiting staff to live in. But many homes still have their own wardens, or scheme managers, who live nearby and have long-term relationships with tenants.</p>",
  "<p>The senior officer at the centre of the Scotland Yard race row is hiring a team of private security guards after receiving numerous death threats which he claims were made by serving Metropolitan Police officers. </p> <p>Tarique Ghaffur, the country's most senior Asian policeman, is considering taking leave of absence after receiving a 'barrage' of threats following his claim for racial discrimination against Sir Ian Blair, the commissioner of the Metropolitan police, and other senior officers.</p> <p>London law firm Dean and Dean, who are representing Ghaffur, said they were hiring private bodyguards to protect the 53-year-old and his family because of the ferocity of feeling directed at him by a hard core of Met officers. Among the scores of death threats Ghaffur has received, a significant proportion are said to have come from 'internal' sources, inside Scotland Yard.</p> <p>The allegations herald a new low for race relations in the Met. Last night Ghaffur was said to be living in fear of his life and that of his family and was exploring the option of taking 'gardening leave'. </p> <p>Ghaffur's lawyer, Shahrokh Mireskandari, said: 'He is considering the best course of action for the sake of his own protection and that of his family.' A friend of Ghaffur's added: 'He has received a barrage of hate threats, many of them actual death threats from internal as well as external sources. His position could now be untenable.' </p> <p>Despite his \u00a31m damages claim on the grounds that he has been the victim of racial, religious and age discrimination, Ghaffur has previously said he would continue to work alongside senior colleagues. Privately, a number of senior police figures believe that the Ugandan-born policeman should be transferred to another job outside the Met or go on leave pending the outcome of his case. Sources at the Yard have revealed that a number of senior colleagues believe it is no longer possible to work closely with him.</p> <p>Ghaffur has chosen not to notify Scotland Yard formally of the death threats made against him because he feels that he can no longer trust the Met to protect him.</p> <p>'You cannot go to the people who you are suing for racial discrimination and ask them to look after you, therefore he needs other means,' Mireskandari said. The lawyer added that hate mail and threats against his client had escalated following comments made by Blair's deputy, Sir Paul Stephenson, at a press conference rebutting Ghaffur's claims last Thursday. </p> <p>During the conference, Stephenson told Ghaffur to 'shut up' and 'stop making public statements about private disputes and get on with the job we are paid to do'. Mireskandari believes that such comments were unnecessarily inflammatory. </p> <p>Ghaffur, who is Muslim, accuses Blair of plotting to oust him and discriminating against him on the grounds of race, religion and age. His legal team say they have a dossier of papers purporting to prove that Ghaffur was the victim of a hate campaign. As an assistant commissioner in the Met, Ghaffur jointly holds the third-most senior rank in British policing, and earns \u00a3180,000 a year.</p> <p>Scotland Yard rejects all allegations of discrimination and has said it will robustly challenge Ghaffur's case.</p>",
  "<p>What do Kate Middleton and the BBC have in common? Answer: apart from being funded by the taxpayer (ho-ho!) they are, it would seem, damned if they do whatever it is they both do, and damned if they don't. Though Kate does seem to be getting it in the neck a bit more than the Beeb recently, what with being accused of being a sponger by her own mother-in-law in-waiting - or, as the Mail put it, 'Royal aides have revealed that the Queen has privately suggested that Kate, 26, should get involved with a charity to counter the potentially damaging public perception that she is workshy.' </p> <p>First things first, however. I spent last weekend at the MediaGuardian Edinburgh International Television Festival, an annual jamboree in which TV executives get exercised about percentages and multi-platform delivery systems, and, very occasionally, something called 'content' (known to most of us as 'programmes'). During this verbal and alcoholic bingeathon, I found myself thinking about the BBC, how great it is and how flawed, and how it is clearly very exhausting being a Great British Institution (GBI), or even, as in Kate's case, just waiting to become one. </p> <p>I am not especially republican; indeed, I am largely in agreement with GBI Vivienne Westwood. The designer's sparky contributions to last Monday's Panorama on the subject of Britishness included admitting that she'd done a volte-face vis-a-vis the Queen, whose safety-pinned visage she had once famously deployed on T-shirts. Now, Westwood wears her own Damehood with non-ironic pride. </p> <p>'[For me] the Queen was, somehow, the figure who represented our hypocrisy. I changed my mind about the Queen, but I haven't changed my mind about British hypocrisy,' the most excellent Dame told the BBC. In the same way her mid-Eighties 'mini-crini' skirt evolved into the high street's 'puffball', I think she's on to something big. </p> <p>I don't really care about Kate Middleton, because I don't know her as anything other than a photograph accessorised by a few biographical details, many of which may be untrue (Middleton's mother, a former flight attendant, being dubbed 'Doors to Manual' by Prince William's Eton mates sticks in the mind, because it's snobbily funny but probably also nonsense). All I know about Kate is that she has already forsaken any right she had to be treated as an averagely bright and pretty middle-class twentysomething in order to become a weirdly chimeric and mutable image onto which we may project whatever we choose. Mostly she resembles one of those 2D cardboard figures in their undies onto which one folded little papery frocks, which I loved so much as a kid.</p> <p>So, even if the Queen really does think the girl nicknamed 'Waity Katy' is 'workshy' because she hasn't had a job since she quit as an accessories buyer for Jigsaw last year, apparently Ms Middleton can't take just any job she may be offered, because (the Mail again) 'everything has to go through Clarence House'. And all this before the wearyingly inevitable Princess Diana comparisons - though William has at least been smart enough to love a brunette. </p> <p>Just as the BBC is damned by non-sports fans for its wall-to-wall Olympic coverage and damned by fans of non-Olympic sports for its wall-to-wall Olympic coverage, so 'Waity Katy' may as well just sit it out in Mahiki and Mustique (only one of these is, I believe, a nightclub) until she's allowed to get on with breeding and charitable works. </p> <p>If a royal engagement really is scheduled for Christmas then Clarence House will want to ensure there are as few referential Diana moments as possible. Though it would be fabulous (if only for me) if Kate landed herself a temporary job at Bhs, Clarence House must be so desperate to get it right this time around that they must also, inevitably, get it completely and utterly wrong. Poor Princess 'Waity Katy' Middleton-Windsor, whoever the hell she is. But perhaps she'll take comfort in the knowledge that her wedding will be covered brilliantly by the BBC.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:kathryn.flett@observer.co.uk\">kathryn.flett@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Jo Duckworth's school in Lancashire has a strict 'handover' policy. Teachers must personally deliver each child into the care of their parent or carer at the end of every school day. The aim is to ensure the child's safety. But for Duckworth, at one stage, that moment became torture.</p> <p>'I had two eight-year-olds in my class, one of whom was probably being sexually abused by her parents and the other was seriously self-harming,' she said. 'Both were being looked at by social services but neither investigations were sufficiently progressed to remove the children concerned.</p> <p>'During the school day, I was monitoring these children on behalf of social services. I had to engage them in all sorts of conversations, spending hours keeping a detailed log of everything we'd said, and making myself available for them at any time of the school day if they wanted to talk - despite not being given any professional training or guidance.</p> <p>'Then at the end of the school day, I'd have to hand these children over to their parents, despite knowing what they were almost certainly going home to. I'd torture myself every night. It was torment. I couldn't get them out of my mind.'</p> <p>Both children were eventually removed from their families by social services. But this was just one example of the stress the 37-year-old Duckworth has experienced during her 10 years as a teacher. Four years ago, she had a nervous breakdown caused, she said, by a range of issues but essentially due to the uniquely stressful nature of the teaching profession.</p> <p>'It's the endless stream of new government initiatives, the targets, the constant Ofsted monitoring,' she said. 'But because you know it's the children who benefit, you end up pushing yourself to excel in everything that's thrown at you. Of course that's impossible, so you end up feeling like you're never able to do anything well enough. You don't see that you've worked yourself into such a state of exhaustion that you're too tired to benefit the children any more. You end up with your self-confidence and self-esteem on the floor.'</p> <p>After three months off work, Duckworth returned to her teaching post. 'I came back despite knowing the pressures and stress would still be there,' she said. 'Non-teachers don't realise what it means to be a teacher. Teachers can't step back and say, \"It's only work.\" I've had personal relationships break down because of the hours I have to work every day, seven days a week.</p> <p>'So why did I come back? I came back because, despite everything, when school starts this Wednesday, I'm going to be on cloud nine. Once the classroom door has closed and I'm alone with my pupils, it's the best feeling ever. You see their smiles and their little shoulders go up when they start to understand something. And when a child comes up to you after a class and says, \"Thank you\", you don't care - for a moment - about the paperwork and the stress and the nightmare lying in wait on the other side of the classroom door. It all becomes worth it.'</p> <p>The new academic year should bring with it a revitalised teaching staff, but many teachers began 2008 with a sense of dread. In staffrooms across the country, 2008 was nicknamed the 'meltdown year' because of the number of policy and curriculum changes the government had implemented, including the introduction of the new diplomas, revisions to A-levels and the new secondary school curriculum.</p> <p>Les Turner is one man who decided enough was enough. After 38 years in the education system, 20 years of which he spent as a headteacher of Freckleton Primary School in Preston, he has retired early - defeated, he said, by the refusal of the government to deal with the issue of stress: 'What we have is a government that is doing the equivalent of rearranging the deckchairs on the Titanic, while asking, \"what iceberg?\". I'm one of many experienced heads who are retiring early and there aren't people who want to replace us. I'm angry and as a profession we should be getting angry.'</p> <p>Teachers' stress is not a new problem. It is almost 10 years since the first case was brought by a teacher suing the government for the stress of work. Muriel Benson, a head of year at a secondary school in the Wirral, won \u00a347,000 compensation for illness caused by stress in an out-of-court settlement in 1999. Since then, the NUT has backed more than 90 cases where teachers have won compensation.</p> <p>Instead of conditions improving since Benson's case, studies have consistently found that teachers are among the most stressed workers in Britain. In a survey published in the Journal of Managerial Psychology in 2005, teaching was ranked as the second most stressful job out of 26 occupations, including, and exceeding, that of ambulance drivers. The pressure, according to YouGov research, commissioned by Teachers TV, has led half of all teachers to consider leaving the profession. </p> <p>'Classroom life has a uniquely stressful nature,' said Stan Gilmore, of the Institute of Counselling. 'Teachers can never drop their guard and are required to exercise a level of unremitting control over upwards of 30 pupils.</p> <p>'Most teachers, if they are honest, will testify that at some point in their teaching career they have encountered difficulties in coping with the relentless pressure to maintain order, leading to the kind of emotional exhaustion colloquially known as a \"mental breakdown\".' </p> <p>John Bangs, head of education at the NUT, is anxious about the impact of such pressure. He pointed to the suicide, last July, of headteacher Jed Holmes who was found dead from carbon monoxide poisoning on the eve of an Ofsted inspection. Colleagues at Hampton Hargate Primary school, Peterborough, said the school's exam results had dipped slightly following an intake of extra pupils and that Holmes had been diagnosed with depression linked to work stress. </p> <p>'The human consequences of this excessive stress on teachers are serious and wide-ranging,' said Bangs. 'They can include physical symptoms but also mental health issues, including anxiety, depression, insomnia, burn-out and an increased risk of suicide. Behavioural consequences can include an increased drug or alcohol intake.'</p> <p>The government is acutely aware of the issue. The Health and Safety Executive is targeting education as one of the top five priority sectors for tackling workplace stress. But the signs are that it has yet to succeed. Last year, a survey carried out by the teachers' counselling service, the Teacher Support Network (TSN) and the Association of Teachers and Lecturers found that demands on staff and their time had increased over the past five years. Seven in every 10 teachers and lecturers said their health had suffered because of the job. Among school leaders, three-quarters said their health was affected.</p> <p>Two-thirds of callers to the TSN helpline reported work-related problems, including stress, anxiety and depression. This contrasts with the private sector where on average about a third of callers to counselling services have work-related concerns.</p> <p>Les Marshall, director of the Schools Advisory Service, the largest independent provider of teacher absence insurance in the UK said: 'One third of teachers take sick leave every year as a result of stress caused by new government initiatives, targets and the impact of being constantly monitored.</p> <p>'We're so disappointed by the failure of the government to tackle this issue effectively, that we're trying to tackle it ourselves. Three years ago, we introduced stress counsellors to visit claimants at home. Those claimants who have this service, return to work three weeks earlier but it still isn't tackling the issue at source. We still need to stop teachers getting into this state.'</p> <p>So why are teachers so stressed? The school day, after all, is shorter than most office working days and when teachers' longer holidays are taken into account, the time they work annually compares favourably with similarly paid jobs. </p> <p>In addition, thanks to new laws, teachers now do fewer administration tasks. There is a strict statutory limit on the amount of cover for colleagues, and every teacher now has dedicated preparation time in the week. </p> <p>Teachers, however, maintain little has changed. A survey by the School Teachers' Review Body, which reports to the Prime Minister and to the Secretary of State for Education on the statutory pay and conditions of school teachers in England and Wales, shows primary teachers work 52.2 hours a week, and secondary teachers work 49.9 hours. Most spend fewer than 20 of those hours teaching. The rest, they say, is spent on tasks that should not be part of their jobs.</p> <p>The discrepancy between government assurances and reality is also seen in Scotland, where a maximum 35-hour week was set for teachers under the McCrone Agreement in 2001. Last year, however, a survey by the Scottish Secondary Teachers' Association, found more than 60 per cent of teachers believed the agreement had not alleviated workload pressures while 37 per cent believed it had actually increased them. Research carried out in 2005 by the General Teaching Council, among others, identified issues of excessive workload as the principal frustration to teachers in carrying out their duties, in spite of contractual changes. It is a finding supported by a TUC league table of unpaid overtime, published in 2005, that showed teachers carried out the largest amount of unpaid overtime in the UK, at an average of 11 hours 36 minutes per week. </p> <p>Such pressure has knock-on effects. Teachers are not only leaving the profession early but fewer are entering it. One recent study found that 40 per cent of teachers expect to have left teaching in the next five years.</p> <p>It is more than 10 years since Tony Blair's famous 'Education, Education, Education' speech, when he pledged to put classrooms at the top of the political agenda. There is no doubt that there has been a major financial investment since Labour came to power. Almost \u00a31.2bn is now spent on education every week. The core 'per pupil' funding has risen by 55 per cent in real terms - or \u00a31,660 more per year per child. </p> <p>There are now about 35,000 more teachers than in 1997 - reducing pupil-teacher ratios and class sizes. Teachers' pay has risen by 18 per cent in real terms, and heads have had a pay increase of 27 per cent.</p> <p>Another quiet revolution has been the huge increase in support workers, such as teaching assistants - up by 172,000: an additional workforce bigger than the army, navy and air force put together.</p> <p>'Let's face facts,' said Kevin Brennan, the children's minister. 'There has never been a better time to be a teacher. Rewind 10 years - wages were poor; working hours going up; class sizes were rising and crumbling facilities were simply accepted. Those days are over.</p> <p>'No one has ever disputed that teaching is a rewarding but challenging job. We have transformed the school workforce culture - working with unions to cut workload; better pay and rewards; to free up teachers and heads; and give staff outstanding career development.'</p> <p>Brennan points to a report released last Thursday by the independent Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, one of the world's largest sources of comparable statistics, and economic and social data, that praises the government's reforms.</p> <p>'Ofsted said last year that reforms have resulted in a \"revolutionary shift in the culture of the school workforce\",' he added. 'There is more to do but research shows that teachers feel their own professional status is starting to improve after decades of decline.'</p> <p>But while most teachers support government initiatives - such as the national curriculum, SATs tests in years two and six, schools inspections and league tables - the pace and manner of change has, they say, caused problems. </p> <p>'There is a surfeit of government initiatives, pressures of assessments targets and inspections,' said a spokesman for the National Association of Schoolmasters and Union of Women Teachers. 'Our vocation has become a political football.'</p> <p>Faye Craster, is a 22-year-old science teacher from north London who regularly works a 65-hour week. In July, at her north London comprehensive, Craster bade farewell to 25 of her 70 teaching colleagues, many of whom cited stress as reasons for leaving.</p> <p>'The school is desperate to improve its league-table ranking. The student intake isn't changing, so the teachers just have to work themselves silly,' she said. 'Time I would like to spend planning is spent on \"banned\" tasks such as data input, bulk photocopying and cleaning.</p> <p>'This has been the hardest year of my life,' she added. 'If I was earning \u00a345,000 a year, I wouldn't mind so much. I'm not getting half that.' </p> <p>Craster says she will only teach for one more year, then she will take her science and communication skills into academia or industry. 'Maybe I'm being selfish, but I'm not staying for the love of the children or the school,' she said. 'Something has to go, and because I can't do a 65-hour week every week, it's going to be me.'</p> <h2>Staffroom stress in numbers</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Half of all teachers have thought about quitting because of stress. Lack of respect from pupils, heavy workload, and dealing with 'pushy parents' are all blamed, according to a YouGov survey in 2007.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Research by the Teacher Support Network in 2007 found that 71 per cent of Scottish teachers felt their job was ruining their health, with stress, exhaustion, mood swings and poor sleep patterns common.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>One in three teachers has turned to alcohol, drugs, smoking and binge-eating because of pressures at work. Some have had suicidal thoughts, according to a study carried in Nottingham last year.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>The number of teachers retiring early has doubled in recent years. Last year 10,270 left the profession early compared with 5,580 in 1998/1999. The figures were revealed in a parliamentary question. Evidence suggested stress, poor pupil behaviour and repeated government initiatives prompted their decision.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>More than 30 per cent of headteachers plan to retire by 2011, research from the General Teaching Council in England revealed in 2006. The study found that fewer than 5 per cent of teachers aspired to become a head within five years.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>In 2004 it was estimated that teachers took more than 200,000 days off due to job-related stress, anxiety or depression. The Schools Advisory Service claimed that the annual cost to schools of this absenteeism was more than \u00a319m.</p>",
  "<p>The traditional green way involved a laissez-faire attitude to personal care products, or even a boycott, hence the jibes about soap-dodging hippies. True, this involved less ecotoxological overload, but didn't suit those of us who are vanity cases with ethical aspirations. Fortunately, since the late Anita Roddick's Body Shop (now owned by L'Or\u00e9al) proved that peppermint foot lotion can be commensurate with planetary respect, the green corner of the bathroom cabinet has flourished.

When the Women's Environmental Network (<a href=\"http://www.wen.org.uk\">wen.org.uk</a>) tested toiletries it found oestrogen-mimicking preservatives in nearly 60 per cent of products. </p> <p>Dumping pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) is a fact of life - everything has a shelf life. But drop them with caution. Worrying about the effects of PPCPs on the water table might seem a side issue. After all, the big water polluters are agrichemicals and other industries, aren't they? Well, no. In industrialised nations our consumerism and personal habits are now the primary sources of contamination of fresh and ocean water. Meanwhile, conventional waste water treatment plants break down only about 10 to 12 per cent of PPCPs, which explains how a 2005 study found more than a tonne of aspirin derivatives flowing down a small London river. </p> <p>So however desperate you may be to embrace a sustainable bathroom cabinet, no flushing or pouring of toiletries and/or medicines please. Boots and other pharmacies will 'take back' old medicines (these are incinerated) but, unsurprisingly, cosmetic giants seem less keen to view their products as hazardous waste and to welcome old jars back into the fold. The best, yet imperfect, solution is to decant all unwanted toiletries into one jar and place in your normal rubbish. While there is evidence PPCPs leach from landfills, this is preferable to washing them away. In future, you can make wiser choices (check that packaging is recyclable and go for biodegradable, non-toxic, sustainable ingredients) in the knowledge that beauty products are far from just skin deep.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:lucy.siegle@observer.co.uk\">lucy.siegle@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Rugby has been playing with its laws ever since that cad Webb Ellis is supposed to have created the very sport by introducing the most revolutionary law of all, viz the one about using your hands. But never has there been such a furore as the one greeting the latest round of innovations, the dreaded Experimental Law Variations, coming to a ground near you in the new season. </p> <p>So let's take a deep breath and look at just what the main changes are and what they mean.</p> <h2>Free-kicks and penalties</h2> <p>Actually, this, the most lambasted law of all, is not being adopted in the northern hemisphere for now. Under it, free-kicks are awarded for all offences other than offside and serious foul play, which continue to be punished by penalties. Whether it will continue to be used in the south (where it has been showcased in the Super 14 and the current Tri Nations) remains to be seen.</p> <p>There are many up here who say it represents a cheat's charter, but does it make such a difference? This Tri Nations has been the usual mix of brilliance and dross that characterises any major tournament. Some say breakdowns are more important than ever, and others that the breakdowns are a complete mess. Plus \u00e7a change... </p> <p>At least it means fewer games are decided by the whim of a referee, but for now, with the suspension of this particular change, the referees will continue to be able to penalise at will. </p> <h2>Small changes that no one could possibly argue with</h2> <p>There are a few of these. The corner flags are no longer touch-in-goal, which means a try will stand even if the scorer touches one of them in the act of scoring. Touch judges are now called assistant referees and can serve as extra eyes for the man in the middle (let's hope they do not build their parts up too much). A quick throw-in may be thrown backwards. If the ball is passed back into a team's 22 and then kicked directly to touch there will be no gain in ground.</p> <h2>The line-out</h2> <p>There are a few changes here relating to lifting and the positioning of throwers and receivers, but the main one is that there is no restriction in the numbers of either team at the line-out. This seemed harmless and sensible enough, but already it is being exploited by clever defending teams, who do not have to drop any of their forwards back 10 metres when the opposition call a short line-out. This means they can make a beeline for the opposition midfield. </p> <h2>The scrum</h2> <p>The main change here is that there is a new offside line five metres behind the hindmost foot of the scrum. This is basically positive, providing more room for attacking teams to work with. There were, however, early signs in the Tri Nations that five-metre scrums had become duck shoots for the attacking side, with defenders having to stand behind the tryline, but with a bit of concentration it does still seem possible for a side to defend against them. </p> <h2>The maul</h2> <p>Defenders may now pull a maul down. This is by far and away the most damaging and utterly insane, not to mention spineless, innovation the sport has ever seen. Rolling mauls are now all but dead. There are genuine reasons for believing that this is a ruse cooked up by the Aussies and Kiwis, who do not like mauling and so have never bothered practising it and are therefore no good at it. </p> <p>They think mauls are unfair because the defending side cannot get their hands on the ball. It would be like us in the north saying it isn't fair when the All Blacks run so much, because they are so fast no one can catch them.</p> <p>It is the line-out that faces extinction under these new laws, not the scrum, as some have suggested. People kick for touch less and when they do there are more quick throw-ins than ever. And when they do take a proper line-out they cannot develop rolling mauls off them. It will make line-outs all but redundant. </p> <p>This means that if you are more than 6ft 4in and you cannot run the 100m in less than 12 seconds there will no longer be a place for you in the professional game. Instead, we will have two more athletic back-row forwards, where once we had lumbering 6ft 7in monsters. The result will be less space for pretty running rugby, not more. The Aussies haven't thought this one through. This law, and this one alone, is madness, and the sooner it is ditched the better. </p> <p>Otherwise, don't panic. The ELVs are nowhere near as dramatic or damaging as some would have you believe.</p>",

  "<p>When Turkish writer Orhan Pamuk won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2006 for what are, in essence, crime novels, it underscored the fact that the oft-asked question about whether crime fiction is 'literature' misses the point. The question should be: is it good literature? Not all of it. Much is formulaic, trite and ultimately disappointing. Poorly written too. Even so, a snobbery towards crime fiction remains. One critic, writing of Michael Chabon's futuristic crime novel The Yiddish Policemen's Union, noted that the author 'spent considerable energy trying to drag the decaying corpse of genre fiction out of the shallow grave where writers of serious literature abandoned it'.</p> <p>That may well be news to James Lee Burke. He is one of the great American writers in part because his fiction explores one of the abiding themes of literature: the Manichaean divide between matter and spirit, between the beauty of the natural world and the evil in man's heart. And he does so in prose that is direct yet lyrically descriptive. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9781409100508\">Swan Peak</a> (Orion \u00a314.99, pp416) sees Dave Robicheaux, that angry, deeply moral conflation of Everyman and knight errant, leave the pain of post-Katrina Louisiana for the wide open spaces and big skies of Montana, where the author's other series character, Billy Bob Holland, usually lives. Robicheaux, his wife Molly and his friend Clete Purcel (strung out on booze, dope and pills) are staying with a retired English professor who is opposed to the development plans of a wealthy rancher. The men intend some fly-fishing, but naturally trouble comes their way.</p> <p>First, Purcel is threatened by two heavies, one of whom recognises him from back in the day when mobster Sally Dio died in a plane crash (in the third Robicheaux novel, Black Cherry Blues). Next, Purcel gets involved with the married sister of the rancher who is being stalked by her ex-lover, an escaped convict. He, in turn, is being pursued by the sodomising ex-Abu Ghraib prison chief whose jail he escaped from. </p> <p>Robicheaux tries to keep his friend out of trouble but is diverted by a request for assistance from the local law, who have two double murders on their hands. One is a Hollywood producer and friend, shot and set on fire on the highway. The other is a raped and murdered student and her boyfriend, killed execution-style. That's a lot of story - and I haven't even mentioned the dodgy revivalist minister. But Burke is a deceptively skilled plotter who brings all the disparate strands in the novel together for a bloody climax.</p> <p>This is a dark book peopled by tormented characters who are vividly evoked. Burke's The Tin Roof Blowdown, his lament for New Orleans, was always going to be difficult to follow. But he is unequalled at providing, as here, a voice for the voiceless, and stands alongside Cormac McCarthy in his presentation of a certain kind of laconic masculinity in which sensitivity and aggression are constantly in conflict. With its trademark mix of brutality and poetry, Swan Peak is a brilliant piece of work from an American master.</p> <p>Critics used mistakenly to describe Kate Atkinson as a magical realist. I can't imagine she gives a thought now to whether she is writing crime fiction or not. The Whitbread Prize winner first strayed into the genre in 2004 with Case Histories, a wickedly hybrid novel. She demonstrated there that the attraction of the genre for a serious writer is its flexibility: what seems constraining about form and structure is actually liberating. Certainly her oblique approach to narrative and characterisation don't fit any kind of standard template.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780385608015\">When Will There Be Good News?</a> (Doubleday \u00a317.99, pp352) again features the enigmatic Jackson Brodie. It starts in the 1970s with a six-year-old girl witnessing a terrible crime in Devon. Thirty years later, the man convicted of the crime is released from prison. Meanwhile, back on Atkinson's home turf of Edinburgh, DCI Louise Munro is looking for a missing person, though not a local GP who has also disappeared. Only the doctor's 16-year-old nanny seems concerned about that. Eventually, the stories merge, but Atkinson takes us on entertaining byways before they do. There is humour - and terrific chapter titles - but on the whole the tone is dark. Not that that matters; When Will There Be Good News? is simply a fine read.</p> <p>While Ruth Rendell's Wexford series has been showing distinct signs of middle-aged sag for some time now, her Barbara Vine novels allow her to retain her title as Britain's pre-eminent psychological thriller writer. Since 1986's A Dark-Adapted Eye, Vine has explored both dysfunctional personalities and isolated and ignored characters with delicacy and precision. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780670917617\">The Birthday Present</a> (Viking \u00a318.99, pp288) is also imbued with the insider's knowledge of politics that Rendell has from her time in the House of Lords. It's set in 1990 and concerns a rising star of Thatcher's government, an intensely ambitious womaniser. He's having an affair with a beautiful north London housewife and wants to give her something special for her 28th birthday. He's already done pearls, so he decides to buy her 'adventure sex'. This involves arranging for her to be kidnapped, bound and gagged and delivered to a mutually agreed venue.</p> <p>Of course, things don't go entirely smoothly. Rendell tells this tense story against the backdrop of IRA bombings, the first Gulf War and government sleaze. The plotting is, as always, consummate and the politician is emblematically hypocritical, greedy and utterly self-absorbed. However, the period she is describing seems oddly like another age. Even so, a suspenseful and chilling tale.</p>",
  "<p>Since Donald Dewar made his statement on the first Scottish Parliament legislative programme in June 1999, this event has been a very sober-suited affair. No ermine robes, no Black Rod, not even a Gold-Stick-in-Waiting. Rather, a statement by the First Minister, followed by questions and a debate. </p> <p>This week will see Alex Salmond make his second such statement to Parliament. Last September, he announced 11 bills to be presented in the ensuing year. Reflecting the minority status of his government, the number and content were modest. Majority votes against toll abolition on the Forth and Tay Bridges or against abolishing the graduate endowment fee were never going to happen and which opposition party would dare to challenge the legislation facilitating Glasgow's Commonwealth Games? </p> <p>From the standpoint of 12 months ago, the biggest legislative hurdle looked likely to be the mandatory budget bill. However, deft political footwork by Finance Secretary John Swinney brought the local authorities and the Tories on-side and secured the passage of the bill.</p> <p>The fact that some local authorities are now starting to complain about the financial pinch, and that the promise to the Tories of 1,000 extra police officers is looking increasingly threadbare, means that the hurdle might be set higher for this year's budget bill. However, it would be unwise to underestimate both Swinney's ability to pull through and, judging by their record to date, the Conservatives' willingness to throw him a lifeline. </p> <p>It is a fair bet that Wednesday's offering from Mr Salmond will also be modest in terms of proposed legislation. A small legislative programme is not necessarily grounds for criticism. The previous administration was being criticised at its end for too much legislation. Moreover, most politicians should remind themselves that their trade is 'the art of the possible'. There will be some recycling from last year's announcement. The Interest on Debt and Damages Bill and the Flood Prevention Bill are worthy measures, wending their way through the consultation process, but yet to be presented to Parliament. </p> <p>A Marine Bill offers an important opportunity to establish a proper framework for safeguarding our marine resources in the face of competing biological, recreational and energy interests. It will be interesting to chart its progress alongside its Westminster equivalent, while looking out for the potential clashes between the two administrations.</p> <p>It will also be interesting to see whether the Justice Minister will legislate to ban alcohol off-sales for the under-21s. Such a measure will not sail through Parliament without opposition. Indeed, within his own party ranks, we can surely speculate what John West, the SNP deputy Lord Provost of Aberdeen, may feel if, after a fraught council meeting wrestling with responsibility for the city's current financial challenges, he finds that he is too young to be responsible for buying himself a can of lager at a local off-sale premises.</p> <p>In last September's statement, Mr Salmond pledged to consult on the replacement of 'the unfair and discredited council tax with a fair local income tax'. That consultation has been completed, attracting a range of critical comments. So will the flagship legislation for the forthcoming session be a bill to implement local income tax?</p> <p>That would certainly provide another challenge to John Swinney's negotiating skills, not least whether he can bring the Liberal Democrats on board, possibly by offering some compromise by making the proposed nationally determined 'local' income tax more local.</p> <p>It could prove to be a tightrope exercise in the art of the possible, albeit with the safety net of abandoning the proposal altogether and blaming Westminster for not handing over the \u00a3400m of council tax benefit currently paid in Scotland.</p> <p>Mr Salmond can also be relied upon to point out that the business of government amounts to more than passing legislation. Specific bills are not needed to implement pledges such as 1,000 extra police officers, reducing class sizes in early years' primary school or increasing dental provision in Scotland's rural areas. By the same token, the lack of a majority in Parliament cannot be an excuse if these promises are not delivered.</p> <p>That is why the real political tests for the government in coming political year may not be in the Scottish Parliament, but in the country. </p> <p>I immediately declare a personal interest in having supported Tavish Scott for the Scottish Liberal Democrat leadership. Not surprisingly, therefore, I agree with his stated intention to focus more on what goes on outside the 'Holyrood bubble'. The underlying analysis is sound. His predecessor, Nicol Stephen, gained little credit outside the bubble for the occasions when he wrong-footed the First Minister at First Minister's Question Time.</p> <p>And as one who still can recall the bruising meted out when, as a member of government, we lost parliamentary votes on fishing and ferry tendering, it causes me astonishment and envy in equal measure to note that in the two or three weeks before the summer recess alone, the SNP government lost votes on education and bus transport and even lost a bill when the financial resolution on the Creative Scotland Bill was voted down, with scarcely a ripple in the media, let alone outside Holyrood. </p> <p>It would not surprise me if Labour's new Scottish leader also came to a similar conclusion and focused more time and attention on what is happening outside Holyrood. After all, it's no coincidence that Mr Salmond and his cabinet have spent so much of the recess meeting in locations from Dumfries to Skye.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Nick Cohen is away</p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown will not rescue the proposed Irish Language Act if, as now seems certain, unionists vote it down in the Northern Ireland Assembly.</p> <p>Downing Street fears that introducing such an act via Westminster would open the floodgates for legal claims to put other ethnic minority languages in Britain on the same par as English, government sources have told The Observer</p> <p>The legislation, a key Sinn Fein demand, would give Gaelic equal status to English in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>But if the Democratic Unionists block the move ministers would also turn down requests for it be introduced via the back door from Westminster, senior sources said this weekend.</p> <p>One said: 'The government won't bring it in via Westminster because the danger is they would be legally bound to recognise other languages such as Urdu, Hindi, Arabic and so on as being of equal legal status to English.

Junior Stormont minister Jeffrey Donaldson said: 'Even if devolution collapsed in the morning and we were back living under direct rule from London, the DUP is convinced there would be no Irish Language Act through Westminster.'</p> <p>Doubts over the delivery of the Irish Language Act come as fears are growing in both London and Dublin over the stability of power sharing in Northern Ireland. Last week Sinn Fein's leader in the Dail warned that if policing and justice powers are not soon devolved to the Northern Ireland Assembly republicans may pull out of the power-sharing executive.</p> <p>The Observer has learnt that the political atmosphere has become so toxic at Stormont that a major investigation into the Troubles headed by former Church of Ireland primate Robin Eames and a key mediator between MI5 and the IRA, Denis Bradley, will be postponed over concerns that its findings will cause another major political storm.</p> <p>The Eames-Bradley report was expected to be published in October and would have included, among other things, a recommendation that the British government publicly apologise for using informers and agents inside paramilitary organisations which were engaged in terrorist acts including murder. The findings will now be published at the earliest in late December, sources close to the truth and reconciliation process in Northern Ireland said this weekend.</p> <p>The Northern Ireland Office has denied putting pressure on Eames and Bradley to withhold their conclusions until the political deadlock at Stormont is broken. </p> <p>On the issue of the transfer of policing and justice powers from Westminster to Stormont, there appeared to be a breakthrough yesterday after Alliance leader David Ford confirmed his party will attend talks aimed at ending the impasse between Sinn Fein and the DUP. </p> <p>In a clear signal that the Alliance was shifting its position, Ford said yesterday: 'We are prepared to play a constructive role. We cannot solve the problems between the DUP and Sinn Fein at the level of political immaturity they are currently at.'</p> <p>A Sinn Fein spokesman said last night: 'Obviously Sinn Fein are focused on resolving all of the outstanding issues including the key issue of the transfer of policing and justice powers. We welcome the commitment of anyone who wants to play a constructive role in resolving this issue.'</p>",
  "<p>Bradford &amp; Bingley is collecting rents directly from tenants of properties on which it has lent buy-to-let mortgages as a way of keeping its arrears and possessions under control.</p> <p>The bank revealed last week that 2.3 per cent of its mortgages are now three months or more in arrears, up from 1.48 per cent in 2007, sending its provision for bad debts soaring to \u00a375m in the first half of the year, more than 14 times the level in the same period of 2006.</p> <p>The provisions, together with losses on its portfolio of so-called 'toxic loans' and a plunge in mortgage lending, helped push the bank into a \u00a327m loss for the first six months of the year, compared with a \u00a3180m profit last time.</p> <p>Chairman Rod Kent said last week that it was already working on its arrears management systems by recruiting extra staff - including a new head of collections - and identifying problem cases earlier. </p> <p>A spokesman said the procedures included using rent receivers, who can go over the head of landlords who are in arrears on their buy-to-let properties. 'We, like many other lenders, are increasingly using Land &amp; Property Act receivers to recover monies to enable the mortgages to continue.'</p> <p>The bank is also in the process of re-negotiating an agreement with buy-to-let specialist GMAC under which it is committed to buy packaged-up loans.

  "<p>When exactly was the moment when a change of government first seemed inevitable? Was it a year ago, when George Osborne made his speech about inheritance tax and Gordon Brown packed away his election plans? Was it when Blair finally decided to give up on New Labour last May? Jesse Norman, the Conservative Party candidate for Hereford, would take it back further, to 29 June 2005 when David Cameron uttered these, not quite memorable, lines: 'We recognise that government doesn't have all the answers, and we instinctively assume the best in people. We trust people. We don't view society from above, like some national project to be managed, directed and monitored. We look at society from the bottom up. Individuals. Families. Communities. Voluntary organisations and faith groups. Businesses. All the complex wonder of a modern, diverse country. We do think there's such a thing as society, we just don't think it's the same thing as the state...'</p> <p>This was Cameron launching his bid to be Tory leader, and making Ken Clarke look old overnight. It was the moment, Norman suggests, when the public first appreciated that crucial possibility: that there might be an alternative. 'People won't change their mind if there is nothing to change it to.' </p> <p>Cameron's choice of venue to launch this speech was as symbolic in retrospect as what he was saying. He was talking at the think tank Policy Exchange, of which Norman was then executive director. Cameron and his team were keen students of the mythology of the rise of New Labour, and they believed that no party rebranding could be complete without an ideas engine to nurture policy and personnel. Blair had had the Institute for Public Policy Research and Demos; Cameron would have Policy Exchange, established three years earlier for that purpose by moderniser-in-chief Francis Maude. </p> <p>In the three years since Cameron's speech, as his star has risen so has that of Policy Exchange (despite the embarrassment of Newsnight's expos\u00e9 of its questionable research into radical Islam, and the recent report suggesting northern cities were doomed). Its staff has increased from 5 to 35, its budget, mostly donations from the City, has grown nearly tenfold. One of its founders, Nick Boles, has become head of policy for Cameron; its former chief researcher, James O'Shaughnessy, is now chief researcher at Tory central office; current director Anthony Browne has just been appointed head of policy for Boris Johnson in London. </p> <p>When Policy Exchange was awarded Prospect magazine's think tank of the year award, a year after Cameron spoke, it was commended for its 'zip' and 'high impact'. Ed Balls MP, then still Economic Secretary at Gordon Brown's Treasury, presented the prize, noting that excellent think tanks were a necessary condition for parties hoping to take power, but, he hoped, not a sufficient one. By the time of this year's Policy Exchange summer party, attended by the entire Cameron court, and a good proportion of New Labour's old entourage, there was a glister of a movement that believed it was winning the argument. The only question that remained was what exactly its argument was. </p> <p>With this in mind, and conference season approaching, I spent the last week asking think tanks if they knew what Cameron was thinking, and what they thought he should be thinking. The most quoted line at the time of that inaugural speech was, 'we do think there is such a thing as society', but in hindsight the first line, Jesse Norman suggests, was as crucial: 'We don't have all the answers'. </p> <p>'I think Cameron is brave to stand up and say he is still coming to a view on certain questions,' Norman argues. 'It takes balls to say, \"We know there is something out there and we don't know what it is yet, but we are finding our way towards it.\"' </p> <p>It's a cop out, too, though, isn't it?</p> <p>'You have to draw a distinction between ideas and a viewpoint,' Norman suggests. 'Ideas come and go, what really matters is an intellectually distinctive viewpoint.' </p> <p>Does Cameron have a new viewpoint in his view?</p> <p>'He has set out the ley lines of a new viewpoint.'</p> <p>Some of Cameron's ley-lined viewpoint is contained in a book Jesse Norman wrote entitled Compassionate Conservatism, published by Policy Exchange. 'The beautiful thing was these ideas we'd been discussing for a long time were suddenly what was required,' Norman says. 'The same thing is about to happen in economics.' He has another book coming out, explaining that. </p> <p>Called? </p> <p>'Compassionate Economics.'</p> <p>Of course. How compassionate, exactly?</p> <p>'Conservatives are currently in the business of replacing the state-versus-individual dichotomy. The new relationship is more like state-versus-individual and many other institutions. Those institutions will be at the core of how we relate to each other on a local level...'</p> <p>Isn't that what New Labour used to call community?</p> <p>'Community is such a loaded term...'</p> <p>And isn't 'compassionate conservatism' a rephrasing of the fabled third way?</p> <p>'The third way is such an empty phrase...'</p> <p>I wonder if Norman sees Policy Exchange as a networking agency as well as an ideas forum. 'I don't see anything that could be described as a \"set\",' he says. 'Just a number of people with a shared viewpoint.' A bunch of people, you might say, in search of a big idea.</p> <p>Just before Beijing I was sitting watching Boris Johnson give a speech to the CBI about the London Olympics. Boris opened with typical blunderbuss bravado. Who, he asked, did they think his political hero was? The CBI, not the most volatile of crowds, sat silent. 'Come on!' roared Boris, with half a smile. 'Who do you think?' There were murmurs of Margaret Thatcher and Genghis Khan. 'I'll tell you,' said Boris eventually. His hero was the mayor in the film Jaws. When the town's population was being eaten by a shark the people rushed to the mayor and asked what he was going to do. What was his policy? The mayor answered that he had no policy, that he was going to do nothing, he was going to leave it to them to sort it out. 'A hero!' Boris declared in triumph.</p> <p>There is something seductive in your big idea being to let others have ideas. It is, as Cameron (and Boris) are keen to suggest, the perfect antidote to the top-down nanny state. The astute Anthony Browne, formerly of The Observer, and the man now charged with concocting Boris's policy of as little policy as possible, is still in his office in Policy Exchange until a successor is appointed. Why has his think tank become so close to Cameron? It's partly, Browne suggests, because in opposition 'they don't have half a million civil servants - or however many it now is - doing their thinking for them'. But despite appearances to the contrary, he insists, Policy Exchange is not a revolving door to Central Office. It also has strong relationships and influence with the government and Nick Clegg's Liberals. </p> <p>'What is extraordinary,' Browne suggests of the current moment, 'is that on a huge range of policy issues there is a great deal of consensus: the big state has run its course; everyone except the old hard left believes you need to introduce more choice and competition into the public sector. The question is how you achieve that.'</p> <p>When I suggest that Cameron (and Boris) are making a virtue of not having defined ideas, but rather having moods and attitudes, Browne says, 'The funny thing is the Conservatives actually have a lot of new policy.' Though when he runs through those new policies - welfare to work, more choice in education, and so on - they have a familiar ring.</p> <p>Over the summer much was made of Cameron's embracing of the idea of Nudge, the readable, much hyped book by the Chicago economists Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstran, that suggests that rather than being told to behave better by politicians it is more effective to 'nudge' (or trick) people into doing so. Thus rather than having an opt-in organ donor card and a big education campaign, it is far more useful to have an opt-out system and rely on people's inertia. This kind of anecdotal marriage of psychology and economics loads the dice in favour of civic virtue without legislating for it. A 'real third way' as its authors inevitably claimed.</p> <p>Will Browne be proposing that Londoners are nudged? </p> <p>'It is certainly fashionable,' he says. 'And it is important to use every tool in the box.'</p> <p>The Fabian Society historically stands for a lot of the possibilities of the planned economy that Policy Exchange derides. Its current director, Sunder Katwala, speaks to me on the phone while exploring a personal version of work-life balance by trying to control his one-year old on his lap. Does he believe that nudging rather than dictating is the way forward? </p> <p>'I think the social responsibility argument that Cameron uses [it's not the government's fault if you are fat] is a clever way of limiting expectations. It allows you to say, two years into office: \"Well, we the government are a little disappointed in you the people.\" You might well want to make a virtue of doing as little as possible in government - Harold Macmillan going to read Jane Austen in the garden of No 10 - but it is also a political reality that if ever anything bad happens then the public demands that the government does something about it. It may be not quite enough to say, \"Well, it's not really our role.\"'</p> <p>What can think tanks contribute? </p> <p>'Public narrative and arguments that link together ideas.'</p> <p>Most good ideas, the American novelist Nicholson Baker once observed, have about the size and complexity of a wheelbarrow. Take the idea of fairness. We probably come to an understanding of what it means at roughly the same age as we understand how a wheelbarrow operates. As a result, fairness is a concept much loved of politicians intent on plain-speaking. Tony Blair, in 2003, when things started to go wrong, vowed to his cabinet that he would submit all of his policies to a 'fairness test'. George Osborne has spent the past week 'campaigning on fairness' making it a 'narrative'. Osborne chose to launch this notion in a speech not at Policy Exchange or the Adam Smith Institute, but at Demos, one of the iconic New Labour think tanks. At the other, the IPPR, Michael Gove, the shadow education secretary, was making claims to that other rather fashionably desired quality 'wellbeing' (expect a speech on that other think tank buzz word 'fraternity' to follow).</p> <p>Richard Reeves, biographer of JS Mill, and cogent theoriser of wellbeing, has just taken over as director of Demos. What does he think Osborne and Gove were up to? 'Well,' he says, 'it is getting harder to tell where a particular idea might be picked up. But let's be honest about this. It serves the Tories' purpose well to have George Osborne at Demos. They are signalling that they are open to ideas from all quarters.'</p> <p>And are they?</p> <p>'Cameron makes a virtue of being a non-ideological politician, all of which makes him as difficult to fathom as Blair. But there will come a point when he will have to answer, for example, how many post offices should we close? And then he could take the Thatcher line - let the market speak - or he might choose to pursue his arguments about social value...' </p> <p>Where the Tories are winning, Reeves believes, however, is in their attitude to ideas. 'On the Conservative side there is huge amount of intellectual energy. Whatever you think about the Nudge thesis the fact is that Thaler came over and the Tories invited him in. Labour just ignored him altogether. It used to be the case that the government policy unit would interrogate someone like that as a matter of course. If you talk to people in the Labour party about ideas for policy at the moment they will say, \"For God's sake, don't tell anyone about this,\" while the Tories don't really mind if their ideas get \"adopted\".' As Osborne suggested in his talk: 'The more that Labour gets started on this agenda, the less work we will have to do on it when we get in.'</p> <p>At Demos, there is perhaps a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu about some of this. While the government is mired in its difficulties, the Tories are using think tanks as their playground just as Blair did while Major was embroiled with the 'bastards' within. In creating their 'new consensus' they are borrowing (or retrieving) many of the opposition's clothes. Geoff Mulgan, co-founder of Demos, can look on perhaps in satisfaction at the way the Tories are moving across tribal lines in their search for policy in the way that he encouraged Blair to do 15 years ago. Mulgan has now himself moved on from the pure 'blue-sky thinking' - fixed-term marriages, legalised drugs and the rest of the original Demos manifesto - that eventually led him all the way to the head of Downing Street's policy unit. He now runs the Young Foundation which he characterises as 'a \"do\" tank rather than a \"think\" tank.' It is, of course - this being Mulgan - the future. </p> <p>'There has been a shift in the way the world works,' he says, ever alert to the new new thing. 'The old think tank days of publishing pamphlets and hoping they will get into a party manifesto are no longer effective. At the Young Foundation we put things into practice. At the moment we have about 35 new organisations under way or starting up, ranging from new ways of providing elder care to new model schools - we are launching several possibilities in America, and in China. We are anti-hype. We tend to quote Harry Truman: \"It is amazing what you can achieve when you don't try to take the credit.\"'</p> <p>In this sense, he suggests, it is not quite so important for the public to find out what Cameron believes as it is for him to discover what works. 'And he gets that point - in the way that most of the commentariat don't, because they are stuck in the printed word.' </p> <p>David Green of the think tank Civitas has also made Mulgan's journey from theory into action. A veteran of both Seventies labour councils and the Eighties free-market Institute for Economic Affairs, Green says: 'We had been talking about it for 20 years, and we thought it was about time we got around to doing it.' Civitas has an experimental primary school and a 'boxing academy' for some of the most challenging teenagers in north London. </p> <p>'We have just had our first GCSE results in,' Green says. 'One got a C in maths and one got a D. In the great scheme of things this is not an outrageous success story but we took the most demanding pupils out there, and we will improve our techniques based on what we now know.'</p> <p>Green believes that such experiments are in themselves the way forward for Cameron. He looks to Richard Reeves's idea of 'character' - set out recently in Prospect - which harks back to Baden-Powell among others, as one way to help restore what he calls the 'de-professionalised' society Labour has created, in which doctors, teachers and the police are able to take less personal responsibility. </p> <p>There was a time when the government's strategy unit under Geoff Mulgan, would invite the likes of Green in to say his piece. 'That hasn't happened lately. You can draw your own conclusion from that. It seems to me the government is trying to hunker down and defend what they have thought in the past. That is probably suicidal for a political party.'</p> <p>Cameron, meanwhile, in Green's experience, seems happy to borrow from anywhere. 'He seems to rather like a phrase I used many years ago: \"There is such a thing as society but it is different from the state...\"' Green says. </p> <p>Cameron may not have any answers himself but he might know a man who does. 'The solution to many of their problems is just that: experimentation and free inquiry,' Green says. But then, as a think tank director, he would say that wouldn't he?</p>",
  "<p>Families coming under increasing strain due to rising food and petrol costs and soaring mortgage repayments may fear that a full-scale recession could leave them in dire financial straits. </p> <p>Predictions of further economic woes abound. This month the International Monetary Fund said the UK economy faces its weakest two years since the last recession. It expects house prices to tumble by about 15 per cent, with the economy growing at just 1.4 per cent this year and 1.1 per cent next year. </p> <p>In addition, unemployment has hit 1.62 million, according to the Office for National Statistics, with latest figures showing the number of people claiming unemployment benefit rising by 15,500 in June to 840,100, the biggest jump since December 1992. </p> <p>So turning a blind eye to the risk of the UK sinking into recession and failing to put adequate protection in place could result in disaster, as David and Julia Donnelly discovered during the dramatic downturn in the early 1990s. </p> <p>By then, the couple, along with their five children, had spent 18 years transforming a two-up, two-down shack into a five-bedroom stone farmhouse in Cromhall, Gloucestershire.</p> <p>'It was idyllic,' says David, then a director at Charfield Insurance Services but now retired, 'and something I'd pictured for years. We were so pleased when we finished our dream home.' </p> <p>He admits to believing the economic turmoil then was 'just a blip' and chose to remortgage the farm for \u00a3275,000 to plough extra funds into the business. 'But we started losing customers, and all of a sudden our Newport firm went bust. At 47, I lost my job.' </p> <p>To add to the problems, their mortgage rate soared from 7.5 to 18 per cent in less than six months. They couldn't keep up repayments and with no insurance cover in place to meet them, the farm was repossessed. 'The bank let the farm go to rack and ruin,' says David. </p> <p>The family moved to South Wales, where they rented a house. David found a job as a risk manager for the local council, but it was five years before they got back on to the property ladder.</p> <p>'We finally bought a three-bedroom house for \u00a328,000, and even with the latest downturn it is still worth an awful lot more, at around \u00a3135,000,' he says. 'Even though we fell to the bottom of the heap, we managed to climb back up - but that said, I can't recommend protecting yourself enough and I've insisted my children take out adequate cover.'</p> <p>Mr Donnelly, who has income protection with Axa, has the scars to show that such a nightmare can come true, yet protection policies remain a difficult and often controversial product to buy.</p> <p>Accident, sickness and unemployment policies, for example, cover your monthly repayments on your most important bills if you are forced out of work by an accident or an illness or are made redundant. They are typically sold alongside loans and credit card deals with the promise that they will meet payments for a year or two. Mortgage payment protection policies work in exactly the same way, but only cover your home loan.</p> <p>However, the Competition Commission recently said such policies had been widely mis-sold. It warned that around a third of all those with such policies would be unable to claim because of their employment or medical situation. In addition, policies sold by banks and loan companies were found to be far more expensive than alternatives available via an independent financial adviser or insurance broker.</p> <p>'However, these remain valuable products, so it's always worth seeing an adviser and using the Financial Services Authority's website to compare policies to make sure you get the right one for you - and, vitally, read the small print,' says Emma Parker, head of protection at Moneysupermarket.com.</p> <p>You can buy freestanding policies that will cover you for a specific amount, so if you are unable to work because of sickness or injury or are made redundant, the money you receive will pay for all your main bills.</p> <p>Eric Galbraith, chief executive of the British Insurers Brokers' Association, adds: 'I strongly recommend that individuals looking to purchase this cover use a broker who specialises in this area of insurance rather than choosing a policy which is tied to a loan.'</p> <p>Most insurers will ask if you are aware of any pending unemployment or whether your company is making redundancies. If your company has already signalled job cuts, you won't get cover. </p> <p>City workers, particularly those working for investment banks, have recently discovered that premiums for income protection have rocketed. They are now deemed to be a very high risk as the credit crunch forces banks to cut staff.</p> <p>Also, the cover only protects against unemployment that is out of your control, so resignation, retirement, voluntary redundancy or being dismissed for misconduct are not normally covered.</p> <p>Typically, most policies have an exclusion period of 60 to 90 days after taking out the policy when you won't be able to make a claim. However, some extend this to six months. 'They cost from \u00a33 to \u00a35.50 per \u00a3100 of monthly cover you require,' says Parker. 'But check your employer's redundancy package and sick pay first as this may be enough to tide you over.'</p> <p>It may also be possible to buy more comprehensive cover in an income protection policy at little or no more cost, says Matt Morris, policy adviser at Lifesearch. Income protection insurance pays out for as long as you are unable to work because of sickness or injury, and you can tack on unemployment cover for an additional premium of around \u00a320 a month.</p> <p>For example, a 30-year-old non-smoking man who is in good health and works as an office manager could get a full income protection policy with benefits of \u00a31,000 a month for \u00a315.25, and could add unemployment cover for a further \u00a319.20 a month. </p> <p>'It's tricky to pick out good providers, as it depends on the client, but Pioneer and Liverpool Victoria are very good, and these tend to be the ones that we look towards,' says Morris. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Lifesearch, 0800 316 3166, <a href=\"http://www.lifesearch.co.uk\">lifesearch.co.uk</a>; British Insurance Brokers' Association, <a href=\"http://www.biba.org.uk\">biba.org.uk</a>, 0870 950 1790.</p>",
  "<p>Expensive extended warranties sold in Britain with electrical goods look set to fall under fresh scrutiny by consumer rights activists and the Office of Fair Trading.</p> <p>The Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations - which came into force because of an EU directive at the end of May - prohibit the 'selling' of rights that people already have in law. But some consumer rights groups argue that extended warranties often do just this, playing on consumers' ignorance. Marc Gander, a founder member of the Consumer Action Group, believes many extended warranties trick consumers into buying insurance that offers them little or no better protection than they already have by law. 'Extended warranties are often an expensive rip-off,' he says. 'These goods are supposed to work for a certain length of time, so what a great trick it is to get consumers to buy an extended warranty in case a product goes wrong too early.' </p> <p>Also known as service or support agreements, extended warranties are offered for all kinds of household goods. They generally begin after the manufacturer's guarantee finishes, usually paying for repairs if anything goes wrong in a specified period. Yet, according to Citizens Advice, consumers are legally entitled to have a domestic electrical item repaired or replaced within six years (five in Scotland) if they can prove the product has an inherent fault (one that existed on delivery, if only discovered years later). Even if consumers cannot prove this, they may still have a legitimate claim if it can be shown that it is not normal for these sorts of products to break down so soon. </p> <p>Joanne Lezemore, senior solicitor at Which? Legal Services, says the 1979 Sale of Goods Act states that goods should be of a satisfactory quality and without defect.</p> <p>'Your goods should also be durable, but how long something should last is dependent upon price and condition,' she adds. 'The consumer may have a claim against the retailer if they can show that the item had an inherent defect. However, from six months after sale, the onus to prove this rests with the consumer, which normally means they would need an independent report of some type to support their claim.'</p> <p>The main benefit of an extended warranty lies in the fact that it normally allows for repair or replacement without any burden of proof - unless the consumer damages or neglects the item. If consumers were prepared to pursue their legal rights more actively, fewer such warranties might be sold.</p> <p>Rather than buying extended warranties, Gander urges consumers to take legal action if their rights have been infringed. 'Our small claims court system helps consumers to assert their statutory rights. You can use it for claims of less than \u00a35,000, and don't have to pay costs if you lose,' he says. 'In addition to suing for your statutory rights, you can send a letter to the OFT and say you consider the practice to be \"unfair trading\". The OFT is then obliged to investigate and take action if necessary.' </p> <p>An OFT spokesman confirmed that it intended to enforce the new law 'where possible'; in the first instance, he advised, consumers should contact local trading standards officers. </p> <p>'Our tests show that most modern appliances are unlikely to break down in the first few years,' says a Which? spokesman, but he was unsure whether the new legislation would prohibit the sale of extended warranties. 'It is likely that this will depend on what the warranty says and how this is sold. Extended warranty providers will need to take extra care to ensure they comply with the new rules.' </p> <p>A spokesman for DSG International, which owns Currys and PC World, believes its extended warranties - or 'customer support agreements' - offer genuine benefits. 'There are many instances beyond 12 months where we are happy to help a customer when their product proves faulty. However, the onus is on the owner to prove the defect was present at the time of sale. A customer support agreement can provide cover for accidental damage, a no-quibble diagnosis, a quick solution within a guaranteed time scale and no fee if no fault is found.'</p>",
  "<p>Kilmarnock moved to the top of the Scottish Premier League with an impressive 2-0 win away to <strong>Dundee United</strong> at Tannadice. </p> <p>Early on United's Garry Kenneth unleashed a 20-yard shot which hit Allan Combe's bar and the home side dominated the first half. Killie took the lead against the run of play five minutes before the interval when Gavin Skelton, making an excellent first start for the visitors, headed past Lukasz Zaluska in the United goal. </p> <p>The game became increasingly heated in the second half, United twice claiming a penalty when Lee Wilkie and then Scott Robertson went down in the area. But it was Killie midfielder Danny Invincible who doubled the visitors' lead with a wonderful goal in the 58th minute. Mehdi Taouil was instrumental in a three-man move down the left-hand side, his reverse pass sending the Australian through on goal to slide the ball past Zaluska from 14 yards, leaving the home side stunned.</p> <p>Darren Mackie's first goal of the season gave <strong>Aberdeen</strong> a narrow 1-0 victory against <strong>St Mirren</strong>. Billy Mehmet, who scored a hat-trick against Dumbarton in midweek, missed two gilt-edged chances for Saints as they controlled the game at Love Street. However, a defensive error from John Potter gave the Dons the advantage two minutes before the break. Potter gave the ball away at the edge of the Saints' penalty area and it fell for Mackie to score with a fierce shot from 12 yards. </p> <p>The second half saw Aberdeen's Lee Miller booked after he threw himself to the ground when taking on Scott Cuthbert just inside the box. The home side were seeing more of the ball but could not find a way through and Aberdeen substitute Jeffrey de Visscher forced Mark Howard to dive low to save his shot on the break. The hosts eventually created one half-chance with seven minutes left when the ball broke kindly for Andy Dorman 18 yards out, but his low strike lacked power and was easily held. </p> <p><strong>Hearts</strong> put the midweek cup exit to Airdrie United behind them as they picked up a hard-fought three points with a 2-1 win at <strong>Hamilton</strong>. Central defender Marius Zaliukas powered in a header from a Andy Driver corner after 18 minutes to give the visitors the lead. The two teams cancelled each other out for the most of the remainder of the first half although home goalkeeper Tomas Cerny made a good save to stop recent signing David Obua from doubling the lead. </p> <p>The home side's hopes of a comeback were dealt a blow when Hearts doubled their lead after 58 minutes. David Elbert attempted to play a pass to Simon Mensing but he lost control of the ball and allowed Driver to run past him and strike the ball from an angle past Cerny. Despite pressure from Hamilton and a late consolation from Derek Lyle, Hearts held on to go second in the SPL with Accies falling to their first defeat at New Douglas Park since April 2007.</p> <p><strong>Inverness Caley</strong> also won 2-1 away, at <strong>Falkirk</strong>, courtesy of a late winner from substitute Dougie Imrie. The Bairns, lightweight in attack without top scorer Michael Higdon, were second best in the first half. Inverness remained the more dominant force after the break and Adam Rooney nodded over a Don Cowie corner. However, Falkirk's Graham Barrett chased a loose ball down and his cutback from the byline allowed Mark Stewart to expertly side foot into the bottom left-hand corner to break the deadlock. </p> <p>Craig Brewster brought on striker Andrew Barrowman as Caley attempted to covert their chances into goals. The Highlanders were rewarded in the 68th minute when Cowie levelled. Imrie rifled home a shot from 16 yards to seal a deserved win as Falkirk succumbed to their fourth straight SPL defeat. It was probably what Brewster's team merited after a combination of wasteful finishing and the saves of Robert Olejnik had thwarted them, especially in the first half.</p>",
  "<h2>Obama supporters raised race first</h2> <p>Race undoubtedly remains a strangely sensitive topic in the United States ('Why has Obama stalled? No one mentions race', Focus, last week). Only the naive would have thought this issue would not play a role in the election. </p> <p>But what Paul Harris and many other pundits must keep in mind is that some of Obama's supporters were among the first to raise race as an issue. During the primary season, prominent media personalities repeatedly spoke about the historic nature of electing an African-American as President, and what affect this might have on race relations. It sometimes appeared as though many of Obama's most vocal supporters seemed uninterested in what their candidate was actually saying, but were instead totally involved with the issue of race. </p> <p>This is rather sad considering that race relations never formed a key plank in Obama's platform, but it goes to show that race preoccupies Americans on both the left and right.<br><strong>Christopher Adam</strong><br>Department of History,<br>Carleton University, <br>Ottawa, Canada</p> <h2>The old have a lot to answer for </h2> <p>Margaret Drabble is a great writer and a clear thinker, but her article, 'The old have a powerful role to play.

Most local libraries don't have a research room or the resources and quiet of the British Library, nor do they aspire to them. If libraries existed with only books and the bygone days that Ms Anderson describes they would cease to exist. But what do I know?

Failed states do not generally have a President who is supported by 67 per cent of the population and who is able to rely on that mandate to push through much-needed reforms to social and land policies.</p> <p>Also mitigating against the notion of Bolivia being a 'failed state' are the strong ties that Morales is developing with other South American states such as Brazil, Venezuela, Paraguay and Chile. The conflicts are because of his attempt to establish a constitution and political institutions that meet the challenges which this country faces while also seeking to help the 60 per cent of Bolivians living below the poverty line.

  "<p>In a sign that the Olympics feelgood factor has already begun to evaporate, protesters took to the streets of Beijing yesterday in an escalating campaign against the city's biggest dump site, which they claimed was polluting the air with a foul stench and dangerous dioxins. </p> <p>Wearing surgical masks and carrying umbrellas, the mostly young, middle-class campaigners blocked roads, chanted anti-pollution slogans and refused to allow rubbish trucks to pass as dozens of police filmed them and appealed for calm. </p> <p>Residents of the affluent Changying district of east Beijing have complained for more than three years about the nearby Gaoantun landfill and waste incineration facility. </p> <p>Every day, 3,700 tonnes of household refuse are buried in the 40-hectare landfill. In addition, the plant burns 40 tonnes of medical waste from hospitals, raising fears among locals that the air is being polluted by odourless carcinogenic dioxins. This is denied by the plant's owners. </p> <p>Residents have petitioned the authorities and filed a lawsuit in the courts. Dissatisfied with the lack of progress, they are using the internet, text messages and demonstrations to be heard. </p> <p>Zhen Qianling, a chemist among the crowd, said the stink from the plant on hot days made him feel sick and sent his heart racing. 'We want to block the traffic so the government will hear our voice. If we just sit back and do nothing, the government will also do nothing.' Like many, this was the first protest he had joined. The demonstrators were young urban professionals - designers, internet workers and translators. Other protestors were from the 'New Sky Universe' and 'Berlin Symphony' tower blocks. Property costs about 14,000 yuan (\u00a31,100) a square metre, well above the Beijing average. The residents thought they were buying into one of the city's most salubrious neighbourhoods, but on hot summer days, when the wind is in the wrong direction, their homes are filled with the stench from the dump. </p> <p>'If I had known, I would never have bought a home here,' says Helen Liu, a translator who moved into her 500,000 yuan house in April.</p> <p>In the run-up to the Olympics, police detained several prominent dissidents and put others under close surveillance. Three 'protest parks' were established, but of the 77 people who applied to use them, none have yet succeeded. According to human rights groups, several applicants were sent back to their home provinces or put in 're-education through labour' camps. Foreigners who staged Free Tibet demonstrations have been deported. </p> <p>The residents of Chanying said they did not fear a police backlash because China was becoming more open and the authorities' concerns about losing face during the Games have diminished. </p> <p>During the demonstration and after police warned the protesters they were breaking the law, they became almost comically well-mannered. They walked slowly back and forth for more than an hour across a pedestrian crossing - but only on the green man - chanting, 'We don't want stinking air.' </p> <p>Managers at the site said emissions met environment bureau standards, but officials acknowledged the smell was a problem. 'We pay a lot of attention to the residents' concerns,' said Guo Tuanhui. 'On hot days, the buried rubbish gives off a bad odour. But we are doing what we can.'</p> <p>The rally appeared to be part of a growing trend in China, as well-educated, middle-class citizens complain about environmental hazards. </p> <p>In May 2007, thousands took to the streets of Xiamen in Fujian province, forcing the local government to halt plans for a chemical factory. </p> <p>Last year, the head of China's environmental agency, Zhou Shengxian, blamed the rising number of riots, demonstrations and petitions across the country on public anger at pollution. </p> <p>The public have good reason to be concerned. According to the World Bank, up to 400,000 people in China die each year from outdoor air pollution, 30,000 from indoor air pollution, and 60,000 from water pollution.</p>",
  "<p>Motherwell's liking for Easter Road will have deepened significantly as a result of another profitable visit, this time yielding their first victory of the season. Having triumphed in both the Premier League and the CIS Insurance Cup at the venue last season, Mark McGhee's side on this occasion plundered the points in a slightly larcenous manner. </p> <p>John Sutton's winning goal arrived at a time when Hibs appeared to have established a certain superiority - of the largely non-threatening variety - following long periods of equality in terms of territorial control and opportunities made and missed. </p> <p>The respective managerial strategies offered the promise of much skirmishing in both penalty areas and perhaps even of a rush of goals but, until that late strike from Sutton, the defenders on both sides proved to be capable of handling whatever threat came their way. </p> <p>Mixu Paatelainen's deployment of Hibs in an orthodox 4-4-2 contrasted with McGhee's 4-3-1-2 for Motherwell, the latter featuring three recognised strikers and indicating the visitors' keenness to secure their first victory in this fourth outing of the campaign.</p> <p>Having finished third and qualified for the Uefa Cup last season, the Fir Park side's disappointments so far were clearly not enough to deflect them from their long-established practice of trying to adhere to an open, aggressive game founded on skill and imaginative passing.</p> <p>In this respect they would be matched and sometimes surpassed by Hibs, ensuring a stream of opportunities at both ends of the field that would hold the attention of the crowd. The long wait for goals seemed to have been over shortly before the interval, but Steven Fletcher was quite correctly judged to have been offside before he met Dean Shiels's cross from the right and headed past Well keeper Graeme Smith. </p> <p>The Hibs striker should, however, have given the home side the lead long before, when he started but then failed to finish a move. Intercepting Smith's long throw with his head, Fletcher played the ball out to John Rankin on the left, and then bolted into the penalty area to receive the latter's low cross. Taking the ball past Mark Reynolds, Fletcher then scooped the close-range shot over the bar with his favoured left foot. </p> <p>Motherwell produced a number of manoeuvres that took them into promising positions, but the closest they came to scoring during an engrossing first half was the powerful drive from Stephen Hughes that brought an important if relatively comfortable save from Yves Ma-Kalambay. </p> <p>Paatelainen's decision to replace a midfielder, Rankin, with another forward, Merouane Zemmama, in the 64th minute seemed to be a declaration of his determination to maintain the pressure his team had been exerting on Motherwell since the start of the second half. There was little subtlety about Hibs' thrusting, but it did keep the visitors away from areas from which they might inflict some damage of their own. </p> <p>Colin Nish's shot from Keenan's pass on the left was well struck, but always drifting wide, while his cross to Fletcher from the left was also not turned to profit by his partner. Fletcher's volley, untidily struck, sent the ball outside Smith's right post by several feet. </p> <p>Given the territorial advantage Hibs had enjoyed for most of the second half, it would surprise no one, least of all the home fans, when Motherwell scored on the first occasion they managed to put the ball anywhere near Ma-Kalambay. </p> <p>It was Clarkson's low cross from the right that found Sutton, back to goal and seemingly covered by a cluster of green-and-white shirts. He was, however, allowed an eternity to turn into clear space and hit a left-foot shot from only six yards high to the left of the goalkeeper. </p> <p>Paatelainen's reaction to the set-back - the removal of midfielder Ian Murray for right winger Steve Pinau - hinted at a desperation that was never likely to be dispelled by an equaliser in the short time that remained.</p>",
  "<p>Given the genocidal record of Belgium's King Leopold II in the Congo towards the end of the 19th century, the choice of Emmanuel de Merode - a descendant of Belgian royalty - as director of Africa's oldest national park might raise some eyebrows. But as crisis threatens to overwhelm Virunga National Park, which lies at the epicentre of a war zone, it is Merode's credentials that count rather than past colonial misdeeds.</p> <p>London-born Merode, a former head of the conservation group Wildlife Direct, is now responsible for the Democratic Republic of Congo's endangered mountain gorilla population, whose plight came to the world's attention last year when photographs of four bullet-ridden carcasses were published. The appointment follows a year which has seen rebel general Laurent Nkunda's army take over the park, swamping it with an estimated 16,000 armed militia.</p> <p>Last week saw the heaviest fighting between the rebels and government forces for a year, and at the centre of the fighting was the Virunga. A growing demand for bushmeat and other illegal products has led to massive and sustained attacks on the park's wildlife. The hippo population of Lake Edward, once the greatest in the world, has been nearly wiped out. The greatest reserve in Africa, with more mammal, bird and reptile species than any other ecosystem, is in grave peril.</p> <p>With financial help from the European Union, Merode hopes to re-establish the rule of law, save what remains of the wildlife and secure the park on a basis of stability and economic growth. It is, to put it mildly, a dangerous mission. A number of his predecessors have lost their lives. Caught up in Africa's bloodiest civil war and deadly fighting between gorilla poachers and illegal charcoal traders, the aristocratic director must manage 680 park rangers. There were once 800, but 120 trackers and guides have been slaughtered in the past decade. </p> <p>'I know this is a tough job,' Merode told The Observer 'You only have to look at the intensity of the conflict in and around the park to understand this is a daunting challenge, but it is a great privilege to be working alongside such a dedicated and courageous team of rangers.'</p> <p>The fate of the gorillas, believed to number around 190 of the world's remaining 700, is causing growing concern. Last year was the bloodiest on record, as 10 gorillas were shot and killed and two others went missing. The rangers don't know for certain the motive of the 'executions', but believe that charcoal traders are to blame. The great apes may have the potential to draw tourist revenue to a desperately poor region and bring in vital funding through conservation groups, but their environment is being destroyed around them. </p> <p>'Nobody knows what's happening to the gorillas up there,' says Felician, a local tracker. 'The few who go in can't find them in the upper slopes any more. We hear and sometimes see the fighting; we don't know if the gorillas are in the middle or in the outer edges.'</p> <p>'Despite the fighting, we are as determined as ever to get back in,' Merode said, adding that mortar and grenade explosions had been booming around the park for days. 'It is critical that we know the status of the mountain gorillas. The more cut off we are from them, the less chance we have of securing their survival.</p> <p>'The Democratic Republic of Congo is emerging from one of the most traumatic wars since the Second World War. All of its institutions, including the judicial system, are very frail, very fragile. Millions of innocent civilians have died. What has happened to the gorillas is a terrible tragedy, but it is in the context of something that's even worse. </p> <p>'What has driven the war in eastern Congo is the pillaging of natural resources. And be it the forests, be it the minerals, it's the richest country in the world with the poorest people. We're losing one of the world's greatest gems in terms of natural resources, in terms of human heritage and in terms of global heritage.'</p>",
  "<p>Premature obituaries have their uses. It is said that when Alfred Nobel, the Swedish arms dealer, read an obituary which described him as a 'merchant of death' he was moved to endow the Nobel Prizes as a way of laundering his image. They also provide opportunities for setting up jokes, as when Mark Twain observed that 'the report of my death was an exaggeration', or when the Daily Telegraph published an obit of folk singer Dave Swarbrick after he'd been admitted to a Midlands hospital with a chest infection. 'It's not the first time,' Swarbrick observed, 'that I've died in Coventry.'</p> <p>What are we to make, then, of the obituary of Steve Jobs, Apple's mercurial CEO, which was inadvertently released by Bloomberg News last week? It was, of course, hastily withdrawn, but not before copies of it had escaped. Given its subject, it was a tame effort, which is understandable because Bloomberg's focus is business. Even so, one would have expected it to delve deeper into some of the more intriguing aspects of Jobs's business career. The saga of how he recruited John Sculley from Pepsi to run Apple, for example, and was then ousted by Sculley, is a compelling story in itself: a visionary genius bested by a guy who marketed sugared water. </p> <p>Then there's the next phase of Jobs's career. Or, rather, the Next phase, when he founded a computer company of that name. Its machines were lusted after only by geeks but they were beautiful for their time. And they changed the world: Tim Berners-Lee wrote the software for the web on one. If that were not enough, when Jobs was summoned back to rescue Apple from oblivion, the Next operating system provided the basis for OS X, the system that now powers every Macintosh (and iPhone) sold.</p> <p>Then there's the Pixar story, and the Disney sequel, which has effectively made Jobs the dominant shareholder in that company; the iPod story, in which Apple seized control of the online music sector; and the iPhone story - still in its early stages - in which Apple goes for control of the mobile phone and mobile-internet market. These all receive cursory treatment in the Bloomberg draft.</p> <p>Bloomberg skirts around Jobs's personal life, mentioning only that he's a Buddhist, a vegetarian and is married with four kids. It does, however, mention his brush with pancreatic cancer in 2004, and reveals that he kept it secret for nine months while he 'sought alternatives to surgery'. And it makes a passing reference to the questions about Jobs's health which surfaced last June after people noticed how gaunt he seemed at Apple's annual developer conference. But it does not discuss how this was handled by Apple and its CEO, even though it's a legitimate business story.</p> <p>The problem is that the stock market perceives Apple as a one-man band, which is why its share price dipped when the health scare broke. Journalists who approached Apple for a comment were told: 'Steve's health is a private matter.' One of those working on the story was Joe Nocera, of the New York Times. After getting nowhere with Apple's PR machine, his phone rang. 'To my amazement,' Nocera reported, 'Mr Jobs called me. \"This is Steve Jobs,\" he began. \"You think I'm an arrogant [expletive] who thinks he's above the law, and I think you're a slime bucket who gets most of his facts wrong.\" He went on to say that he would give me some details about his recent health problems, but only if I would agree to keep them off the record.'</p> <p>Nocera was able to reveal, however, that Jobs's problems were not life-threatening and that his cancer had not recurred. 'After he hung up,' Nocera reflected, 'it occurred to me that I had just been handed, by Mr Jobs himself, the very information he was refusing to share with the shareholders who have entrusted him with their money. You would think he'd want them to know before me. But apparently not.'</p> <p>There is an intrinsic conflict between technology companies' need for 'visionary' leadership (which enables the boss to follow his instincts) and shareholders' need for market-sensitive information. Google has a two-tier shareholding regime to enable its founders to do more or less what they please. Apple doesn't have such a system, which is why Jobs resorted to the New York Times. Perhaps one can guess what music will be played at his funeral, when it eventually comes: Sinatra singing 'My Way'.</p>",
  "<p>They are hallowed hallways by any measure, those of the Philharmonie in Berlin. Home to what most critics would acknowledge to be the greatest orchestra in the world, it stands off Potsdamer Platz, across which the wall that divided Europe once cut. There is so much charismatic history both of music and of politics here - a battleground and fulcrum of the 20th century.</p> <p>So there is something both strange and refreshing about the face and figure at the apex of the Philarmonie's solemn edifice, the present carrier of the traditions of the mighty Berlin Philharmonic. It is Simon Rattle, a man one thinks one knows, not just because he is British, and not only because of countless evenings watching him conduct and the immersion in the sound his conducting inspires, but also because of all those cliches attached to him. Like his mop of curly hair (irrelevant) or the baffling but habitual likening of Rattle to Tony Blair - because he is said somehow to 'spin' music (downright offensive). Mr Nice-Guy, 'Our Simon', the man who made it to the top job in music.</p> <p>In the event, apart from his musical mastery, what is so compelling about the man who, to my mind, has made a greater impact on the arts worldwide than any other living Brit, is none of these things. The exact opposite in fact: it is the passion and intensity - severity almost - with which he discusses what he believes, loves and disapproves of, be it with regard to Berlin, music, children, children and music, The Sopranos, Cuban jazz, football, or the city in which he was born, and to which, after a couple of London Proms on Tuesday and Wednesday, he travels to give the first of two historic concerts: Liverpool.</p> <p>In Liverpool, Rattle needs no introduction. He is a local hero whose return to this singular place has a resonance akin to a homecoming performance by Michael Owen or Paul McCartney, only a more convincing and cogent one nowadays than either of those could muster. Rattle is one of the highlights of the city's stint as European Capital of Culture.</p> <p>On Thursday, the 53-year-old Scouser comes home to the Philharmonic Hall between the cathedrals - the Anglican colossus and 'Paddy's Wigwam' - on Hope Street, with his Berlin Philharmonic, to play a concert of music by Wagner and Messiaen. And a month later, on 2 October, there is an even more emotionally charged event: Rattle will conduct the orchestra to which he listened as a child and conducted at the age of 20, the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic, playing the same symphony he conducted that evening back in 1975, Sibelius's fifth. </p> <p>'Talk about a home match,' he enthuses in his room at the Berlin Philharmonie. 'If you are sentimental, as I am in buckets, it's going to be quite a moment. With the Berliners, it will be amazing but, in a weird way, even more with the Liverpool Phil. One of the things I decided to do was to conduct the very first piece I ever conducted with them, which I might have conducted more than any other symphony during the years in between. It will be a very, very special moment.'</p> <p>Liverpudlians harbour notoriously powerful feelings about where they are from, a city which turns its back on England, an Atlantic city looking seawards. Rattle is no exception and an agreeable undertow cuts beneath our conversation because Liverpool is also my mother's [children's author Shirley Hughes] home town. Rattle knows her books and her father's department store, TJ Hughes (still there and making a fortune for others) on London Road at the entrance to Everton Brow. 'Of course Liverpool looks seawards,' says Rattle. 'They call themselves smoked Irish, don't they? Liverpool is off the side of the known universe and it always was.</p> <p>'New York is the only other place comparable. You don't like Liverpool: you either loathe it or you love it. And I don't know anyone who loathes it and comes from it. You don't have [and Rattle uses a German word meaning 'middle' or 'medium'] mittel-message feelings about Liverpool. The minute I get off the train and hear the accent, I'm sold. One \"arright?\" and I'm home. And it's nice to see it in such a renaissance because there were some really rough times in Liverpool, after the riots, the Derek Hatton years.' </p> <p>He says this with solemn slowness, as though a dear friend had been abused by the years when Hatton and Margaret Thatcher picked over Liverpool's bones.</p> <p>'And it was a depressing place. Now it's alive, it has cleaned itself up wonderfully, but it's always going to be itself.'</p> <p>The conversation moves to Rattle's childhood and first experiences with music, though there is a painful poignancy in the timing: his mother Pauline died four weeks ago and so the planned reunion with her son and all her grandchildren at Philharmonic Hall, just short of her 90th birthday, will not happen.</p> <p>Rattle was born in January 1955 in what he calls 'the Jewish, liberal-voting suburbs around Sefton Park where my ... I keep saying where my mother still lives. I mean, where my sister still lives'. But to hear him, you'd think he had grown up in the Philharmonic Hall, listening to the orchestra he will conduct in October, and which was the gateway to those 18 years as conductor of the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, then on to Berlin. 'It's the orchestra from which I learnt what music sounded like, at a time when the programming was the most adventurous in Europe. I went to every possible thing I could and that meant seeing Charles Groves [the LPO's music director] who believed in playing everything. I heard the old, I heard the new. If a wonderful new piece arrived like, for instance - 1970 I think it was - Birtwistle's Triumph of Time, Charlie heard about it and that would be the beginning for the next season.'</p> <p>Groves conducted a complete Mahler cycle with the same orchestra, which was, enthuses Rattle, 'the first time that had been done in Europe, believe it or not. It had only been done in Utah by Maurice Abravanel. The Mahler was extraordinary. Many of us were teenagers at the time, we wouldn't miss them, and I can still remember the impact. The second symphony changed my life enough to make me a conductor. George Hurst conducted that. I can remember hearing the third symphony; there was an interval after the first movement, friends looking at each other, completely overwhelmed by the impact of the music.'</p> <p>Rattle's Tuesday Prom and the Berliners' programme in Liverpool culminate with Messiaen's Turangalila Symphony - like the Sibelius, by autobiographical design. 'When I was perhaps 10 or 11 the Turangalila was a very rare thing, but of course it did happen in Liverpool. But there was a bus strike. My parents never let me go to concerts in the week because it was school time and I had to badger and badger them. I'd slipped into the rehearsals at the weekend, which I did a lot - the 86 bus and I were bosom pals - and said, \"I have to hear this piece.\" And so, aged 11, I managed to persuade my father to take me. I met Messiaen and got the autograph - I still think it was one of the most thrilling moments of my life. I thought I was going to jump out of my seat. So it is extraordinary to be going back to Liverpool to play Turangalila on what would have been Messiaen's 100th anniversary, really emotional.'</p> <p>So who was this child who 'badgered' his parents into taking him to hear Messiaen? 'An uncomfortable, overweight, intense boy with this huge passion,' replies Rattle. 'And the minute I started playing in the Merseyside Youth Orchestra when I was 10, from that moment I felt much more comfortable with myself because there were other people dealing with the same kind of enthusiasms and obsessions. Yes, I was a weird duck, no doubt. But it's very funny talking to the people in Berlin, amazing how many of them would describe themselves as the strangest person in their class. People are astonishingly honest here, and that's not a German thing, it's a northern thing. For a Scouser, it's great to be in Berlin because people are very straight - you know exactly where you are with them, and they tend to tell you things like that.'</p> <p>My eldest daughter's first orchestral concert was a performance of Mahler's eighth symphony, on her eighth birthday, played by the European Union Youth Orchestra under Rattle's baton. And for all my fears that she would probably want to leave after eight minutes, she heard it out on the edge of her seat, and recalls it all, and him, vividly. Rattle and I talk about this - 'Would I subject my eight-year-old to that?' he wonders. 'Probably not!' - but only by way of introducing a theme about which Rattle feels as deeply as anything else: children and music. </p> <p>As reported in this newspaper recently, a battle rages over music in British schools between people such as Rattle, Julian Lloyd Webber and Peter Maxwell Davies, who believe that deprived children have a right of access to great classical music, and those - with their bastion in the north west, as it happens - who believe that music education should consist of what is regarded as 'relevant' to children and chosen by them, not 'bourgeois' and 'imposed' from the classical heritage. It's a situation which results in poor children studying rap music in class and never hearing a note of Beethoven.</p> <p>This stands in diametric opposition to an initiative in Venezuela energetically promoted in Europe by Rattle called El Sistema, whereby the poorest barrio children in shanties beleaguered by gang warfare and drugs are organised into orchestras to play classical music. It was the brainchild, 30 years ago, of an extraordinary man and inspiration to Rattle, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Abreu, who once told me, unforgettably: 'The rich owe the poor a debt which they will never pay materially. But they can repay it culturally, so that to deprive the poor of great, high art is a terrible form of oppression.'</p> <p>Rattle's championing of Abreu, and his protege, conductor Gustavo Dudamel, led to the appointment, at age 18, of the Berlin Philharmonic's youngest-ever recruit, double bass player Edicson Ruiz, who came up through El Sistema, and who told Rattle: 'When I was nine, I didn't know I would get a meal at night or every day, but I did have a viola.'</p> <p>'The point is,' says Rattle, 'that this has saved countless lives - there are now close to half a million children involved. We have got to get Abreu the Nobel Prize,' he says, more intense about this than anything else during our conversation. 'Is there anyone who deserves it more?'</p> <p>But the obvious question remains: why do the poorest children in the poorest countries in the world get Beethoven while those in England get Jay-Z? 'Maybe this could only happen in a culture where they have so little,' says Rattle. 'I've heard that they have been studying El Sistema, and there is a Scottish pilot plan going on, and I cannot tell you how well I wish them, but I have the feeling that a culture that has so much and so many other distractions and so many more material things will not have the same chance of success. As the [Venezuelan] kids said to the audience here: \"This is not an important part of our lives, this is our lives.\"'</p> <p>When Rattle took over the Berlin Philharmonic, he made it a stipulation that the orchestra would engage in 'outreach' projects involving deprived children and poor neighbourhoods in the city. But he is harsh with himself about the potency of such projects and the outreach work by British orchestras on which they are modelled: 'We do what we can here. And we have touched the lives of a lot of people. But I am very aware that we are just throwing them very occasional vitamins, whereas someone like Abreu has rescued a whole society. The society there is so fragmented that it has almost a kind of cohesion. It's as though the music was able to flow through all those gaps and pull it together. I think that here - maybe I'm wrong - I can't see it getting beyond the first barriers and I can't, frankly, see the political will.'</p> <p>Rattle famously spent 18 years from 1980 with the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, lifting it from British music's Championship to the Premier League, though not the European Champions League, playing in Britain's most acoustically perfect performance hall. His loyalty to the orchestra and city was a shining example of dedication and won him many accolades. </p> <p>It also won him election by the Berlin Philharmonic under the democracy whereby its musicians appoint their leaders. He was elected on a specific manifesto to expand the orchestra's repertoire and sound textures. Since that time, the same article about Rattle has been written a thousand times in Germany and Britain. </p> <p>It debates (and I summarise) the notion that Rattle's programming, which entwines the core of Austro-German romantic music, which the Berliners play with unrivalled intensity and mastery, with different shades and timbres from other countries, epochs and traditions, might in some way squander the glorious 'inner glow' for which the orchestra and its Germanic heritage and unrivalled sound are revered. Does Rattle dilute the great traditions established by his awesome ancestry at the Berlin Philharmonic: Claudio Abbado, Herbert von Karajan, Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler? </p> <p>Different writers reach different conclusions but it should be remembered that the great Abbado was also criticised for not being as great as the greater Karajan, and the greater Karajan took flak for not being as great as the superlatively greater Furtw\u00e4ngler, as though the destiny of the world's most magnificent orchestra operated to a law of diminishing returns.</p> <p>This over-trodden discourse has made a man called Axel Br\u00fcggemann one of the most quoted music critics in the world for writing in Die Welt that under Rattle, 'the Philharmonic's musicians sometimes play as inconsequentially as if they were a wife reaching into the fridge for a beer for her husband' (he later leapt to his own defence in the Frankfurter Allgemeine, under a pseudonym). </p> <p>Well, the mighty Berlin Philharmonic will deliver its own reply on the matter of whether it should also play non-German music by playing Messiaen, Shostakovich and Sibelius in London and Liverpool. And Rattle's retort is this: 'It is astonishing that there are people who think that they shouldn't. It's staggering. Intelligent British music critics, who would consider themselves forward-looking.</p> <p>'Yes, there are certain areas of the repertoire for which this orchestra was designed: you play Bruckner, Wagner, Brahms with them, there's just no argument, and part of my job is to make sure that that body still remains. But it's also to give it a different type of feather, other colours. Like Messiaen: Turangalila is not only a great song of joy and release after the Second World War, but deeply to do with Tristan and Isolde and that myth and, in a way, enormously Wagnerian.'</p> <p>So now we are free to move on to other things, such as the self-evident but often overlooked fact that the world's greatest conductors harbour other passions beyond music. Many people were surprised that Simon Rattle took a year 'out' to study English literature at St Anne's College, Oxford in 1980/1. But why should they have been? 'I was of that generation, the last generation, where if people did well, they skipped classes, they moved forward a year,' says Rattle. 'That happened to me twice, so I finished my A-levels when I was 16 and wanted to go to university but they wouldn't have me at 16, completely correctly. So I went to the Royal Academy of Music, thank God. </p> <p>'In my mid-twenties, I was with a conducting career, but I had never been to university and I wanted to. There were things I wanted to study in depth. I also wanted to see if I could survive without music. There were tremendous hunger pangs, but it was interesting how anything else of the same specific gravity could fill that. It was wonderful for me to know that I could be just as moved and uplifted by Andrew Marvell or Ulysses as I could be by music. And, of course, when I came back to the music there was a quality and an intensity that you get when a painting is well restored.'</p> <p>Books did not vanish from the shelves when Rattle returned to music. 'Right at the moment, I'm reading this extraordinary newish translation of Don Quixote and it is more than a delight. It suddenly struck me: it is the same kind of time as Monteverdi - they were more or less contemporaries. Monteverdi is inventing opera and Cervantes invents the novel. It's there, complete: everything you would ever need in a novel, particularly the irony of the tone which wasn't going to be seen again until the 19th century.' </p> <p>One slightly dreads asking Rattle about his romantic life because the question is as predictable as it is unwelcome to a man of his, well, amorous nature. He was first married to the American soprano Elise Ross, with whom he had two sons (one of whom, Sacha, is a clarinettist), then to the screenwriter and political activist Candace Allen, but fell madly in love with the famous Czech mezzo-soprano Magdalena Kozena, with whom he has two young sons, Jonas and Milos. At home he says: 'The jazz records come out a lot. You find that with many musicians - we don't listen to our own music for relaxation. It was Sarah Vaughan on last night, Magdalena and I saying, \"Was there ever a better singer?\" It's funny - if you were to name the 10 greatest jazz singers, would you necessarily name Sarah Vaughan? I'm not sure I would, but you listen to i t...</p> <p>'Then there are endless mambos, Venezuelan music [to which Jonas and Milos love to dance] and Gonzalo Rubalcaba, who is the most gifted pianist on the planet and a wonderful man.' One wonders how Rattle's opposite number at the Deutsche Staatsoper down the road, the inimitable Daniel Barenboim, would react to that remark.</p> <p>During my six years living in New York, some of the most precious evenings were those spent ensuring I got to hear the Cuban Rubalcaba whenever he played, with his astonishing, lyrical intensity, and off we go. 'I love him even more now,' says Rattle. 'I loved his early stuff when he played faster than anybody who has ever been born, but he uses that very sparingly now - he can be very still.'</p> <p>Does he mind having this conversation rather than one about whether his orchestra should or should not play Shostakovich? 'This is important,' he says. </p> <p>So what about films? 'With two small children, films are a real treat, because you have to decide,' he replies. 'What I did was to install a full cinema screen in our house. But I am living with someone from the Czech Republic, who was not able to see a lot of the things that she should have seen. She hadn't seen 2001. She's seen every film by Eisenstein, as you can imagine, but there are many things she hasn't - Kubrick, Werner Herzog, all those things. We catch up with films late, but we got completely hooked on The Sopranos and watched that from beginning to end, the most astonishing single piece of narrative television I've ever seen. Perfect for parents of young children - 52 minutes you can watch, a film you can't.'</p> <p>Rattle suits this city: transformed as it is, funky, cultured and breezily intelligent; capital not only of a changing, emergent country both young and old, but the heart of the new, unified European continent that Britain refuses to partake in. He has been out of the UK for six years now and made Berlin home for four of them. Now Rattle views the island of Britannia, this hubristic isolation and thereby his own identity, differently.</p> <p>'We're in Europe, it's just that no one has realised. I think Europe is a real ideal, but then I would think that - it's easy for someone who travels around that much. We are part of Europe, there is no escape from it. But even in Iceland, I think they feel more in Europe than we do. We are in it whether we like it nor not, and eventually that'll get through into the political discourse, which is not very impressive at the moment. </p> <p>'And my God, Europe needs itself, we need each other more and more in this strange, fragmented world. We had better learn. Having said that, I do feel deracinated. Some political things that seemed desperately important in England seem, shall we say, less significant now. Obama versus McCain is much more important for the world than anything that might be going on in the Labour party right now.'</p> <p>The final difficult question to ask any Scouser is whether they are red nosed or blue nosed, Liverpool or Everton, because they know the answer will alienate half the city. Luckily, Rattle saves me the embarrassment, simply continuing the conversation we are having about his 'deracination'. 'There was a friendly match between the Berlin team and Liverpool, my team, a few weeks ago and I went with my two older sons - and they went crazy. They said, \"Dad, you're cheering both sides!\" But these are my two cities. And this is also possible. I'm deracinated enough to cheer for the Germans as well as the Scousers.'</p> <p>So: from Liverpool to Berlin, to raise a cheer for both, before bringing the Berlin Philharmonic back to Liverpool and then conducting Merseyside's local band. But there are even more pressing engagements: 'If I didn't have to meet the children at the playground,' says Rattle, 'so that Magdalena can do Pilates, we'd have longer to talk.'</p> <h2>Fast Movement<br>A life in music</h2> <p><strong>1955</strong><br>Born Simon Denis Rattle in Liverpool. His parents, Pauline and Denis, encouraged his early talent: at four he had a drumkit; by 11 he was playing percussion and piano, then conducting for Merseyside Youth Orchestra.</p> <p><strong>1971</strong><br>Rattle attended the Royal Academy of Music in London. Shortly before joining he played once with the National Youth Orchestra under Ivey Dickson (pictured), managing to arrange a lesson with Pierre Boulez in the process.</p> <p><strong>1974</strong><br>Rattle won the John Player International Conductors' Competition and was awarded the post of assistant conductor of the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra. Impressive reviews followed.</p> <p><strong>1980</strong><br>Aged 24, Rattle was appointed principal conductor of the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra. During his 18 years there he turned the orchestra's fortunes round and became a household name himself. He was knighted in 1994. </p> <p><strong>2002 </strong><br>Rattle became the artistic director of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. Despite a brief mauling in the German press, in 2008 the orchestra's musicians voted for Rattle to remain in his post until 2020. <br><strong>Imogen Carter</strong></p> <h2>From the archive<br>The Observer, 29 June 1975</h2> <p><strong>Stephen Walsh, then the deputy classical critic, reviews the young Simon Rattle</strong></p> <p>Tuesday's concert in St John's, Smith Square, by the Salomon Orchestra featured a gifted young conductor, Simon Rattle, in performances of Haydn's 95th Symphony, the Adagio of Mahler's 10th and Strauss's Don Quixote. The Salomon, one of the best of amateur orchestras, has a good record in bringing forward young conductors. I doubt, though, whether even they have gone much nearer the cradle than Mr Rattle who, already a winner of the Bournemouth Conductors' Competition, is barely 21.</p> <p>Mature conductors of that age are rare, and even Mr Rattle wasn't quite equal to the basic difficulty of securing deft and athletic playing from amateur players in a Haydn symphony which many of them obviously regarded as a warming up exercise for the technical exertions of the other works.</p> <p>Easily the best performance was of Mahler's beautiful 25-minute Adagio. Mr Rattle, who has experience of Mahler, showed remarkable ability to sustain long melodic sentences and build them into coherent paragraphs. The searing climax, with the wind sections in superb form, was by any standards exciting. But the whole movement was intelligently and sensitively shaped, and commendably well played.</p> <p>Don Quixote, also difficult but in different ways, interspersed playing of great vitality (including from the cello soloist, Moray Welsh) with a certain untidiness. There was some over-playing. But the conductor again showed mature control, and a lively grasp of musical portraiture and narrative.</p> <h2>Young Simon<br>A teacher recalls</h2> <p><strong>Geoff Cowie</strong><br><strong>Now chairman of Liverpool Philharmonic Youth Orchestra (formerly Merseyside Youth Orchestra) </strong></p> <p>I met Simon the very first day he came to join Merseyside Youth Orchestra (MYO). He was 11 or 12, and I was the deputy conductor. I've been involved with the MYO for 57 years and I've seen countless youngsters coming in and occasionally one comes in and you think 'yes, this one's different'. Simon was the first person I really recognised as having that special something.</p> <p>He was just a little lad, and he was younger than the minimum age to join. I don't think Simon actually auditioned but the then conductor Bill Jenkins, who founded the orchestra, he made the rules and bent the rules! Back then he played timps and percussion. He wasn't virtuosic: the musicality didn't show out as much as it would when he started conducting with us. But I enjoyed conducting him on a number of occasions. Once we did a version of Eric Coates's 'The Three Bears' suite, which has a narrator, and his father did the narration.</p> <p>My most enduring memory of Simon is of a trip the orchestra took in 1972 to Lausanne in Switzerland for an international competition. Simon decided he wanted to gather a group of his peers together and conduct them. I can't remember the piece but he pulled together quite a large number of people, from orchestras from all over the world - Japan, Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, South Africa. I was incredibly impressed that he had the motivation and the guts to say 'will you come and play for me' - and dozens of them did.</p> <p>I've only seen him a couple of times since he took the job at Bournemouth in 1974. A few years back he brought his new partner and baby to Liverpool to see the Philharmonic Hall. It was a Sunday morning and I was with the youth orchestra rehearsing. Simon cried out 'Geoff' in greeting and I shouted 'Simon' and the youth orchestra were all open-mouthed in awe, because he's their hero. <br><strong>Interview by Imogen Carter</strong></p>",
  "<p>In an illuminating column, my colleague Heather Stewart recently noted that it's not just house prices and growth rates that have tumbled down in the credit crunch. It's the whole easy assumption that the market knows best. </p> <p>For three decades a single dominant thought has crowded out all others: that managing, whether of economies or organisations, is a matter of switching on the automatic pilot of the market's invisible hand and letting rational selfishly motivated individuals do the rest. NHS, railways, pay, investment, economic structure ... there was no problem for which the free play of the market would not provide the answer.</p> <p>But the dominant idea is now under attack. One prong of the offensive is the course of events; after all, it wasn't supposed to be like this. Over the past decade, rather than a stimulating pat on the back, the invisible hand has administered a succession of increasingly damaging haymakers: South East Asia, hedge fund LTCM, the dotcoms, Enron and other corporate scandals, now the sub-prime shambles. After several knockdowns, the unfettered market has put the global economy on the canvas for the count.</p> <p>Despite the efforts of the cheerleaders, only a tiny minority actually benefited from the era of rampant financial capitalism inaugurated by Wall Street and the City and, as polls consistently show, few in either the US or UK have any trust in its institutions or officers. They are right to be suspicious. But, as Stewart also noted, just as the practice of financial capitalism is being questioned, so are its intellectual underpinnings. As it excavates the foundations, the burgeoning school of behavioural economics is shouldering aside the desiccated calculations of economic man to make legitimate space for emotion, altruism and fair play in economic behaviour.</p> <p>The final element in the attack on orthodoxy comes in the shape of what we have learnt about management over 25 years. From the performance of exceptional outliers in a surprising number of industries - John Lewis and Whole Foods Market, WL Gore, Nucor, Southwest Airlines, Semco, Toyota - we know that good work can thrive in a variety of ownership and incentive structures. </p> <p>It has nothing necessarily to do with stock options, private ownership or extravagantly paid senior executives. It does have to do with effective work organisation and systems, which the individual performance management regimes favoured by the private sector are as likely to destroy as to support.</p> <p>It is now apparent that where the private sector does excel is in disguising the full costs of its incentives by externalising their dysfunctional results on to society as a whole. Today's credit crunch is the most stunning example of this perverse behaviour in economic history.</p> <p>Of course there's no hiding that much public service is depressingly bad, but again this has nothing to do with public or private; customer service in the private sector is equally poor. This is not surprising because, ironically, the badness in both cases could be said to be another market externality - the purchase of identical IT-based mass-production service systems geared to meeting the internal incentives of the management consultancies that sell them rather than the needs of the end customer. Intrinsically, there is no reason why public-sector organisations cannot provide service at least as good as the best private sector outfits - and a growing number of them do.</p> <p>The discovery that, pace private equity, work organisation is just as important for performance as agency theory or ownership liberates - or should - all kinds of new thinking about how services could be organised and delivered. It's not the market that will provide the answer to poor public (or indeed private) service: it is, as it always was, the hard work of establishing what the customer wants and organising the work to meet it with minimum fuss, and therefore least cost. </p> <p>No one would want to return to some of the methods of the nationalised industries of the past - although it now appears that their performance may not have been as bad as it seemed at the time. But as we have seen, the public sector has no natural monopoly of management badness any more than the private sector of good. </p> <p>The late JK Galbraith once noted that the left needed to be smarter about management than the right, since it insisted on taking under its control industries which the private sector had given up as basket cases. The conclusion still applies, but for the opposite reason. Ironically, if it is tragically the case that after all the frantic activity of the past 11 years, public services are still as much in need of reform as ever they were, it's because of New Labour's simplistic reliance on the invisible hand. Management of the market is more important than management by it.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:simon.caulkin@observer.co.uk\">simon.caulkin@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>When Juande Ramos says: 'You get the feeling the sooner the whole thing is finished the better,' you know he is getting a proper taste of being a Tottenham Hotspur manager; a flavour of the numbers-led myopia that descends on the north London club whenever the transfer window opens. This year's Dimitar Berbatov transfer saga is reminiscent of situations gone by</p> <p>Summer 2006: Michael Carrick's move to Manchester United drags into the final weeks of pre-season as Tottenham squeeze the fee up to \u00a318.6m. Martin Jol, the then Spurs manager, is left scrambling to compensate for the loss of his most important midfielder. </p> <p>Summer 2007: Jol requests the purchases of three players: the left-winger Martin Petrov, a holding midfielder and an experienced centre-back. Daniel Levy, the Spurs chairman, balks at Petrov's wages, then buys attacking midfielder Kevin-Prince Boateng and defender Younes Kaboul. Both prove so ineffective, they are transfer-listed inside a year. </p> <p>Summer 2008: Berbatov wants out for the second season running. Ramos argues for the forward to be sold quickly and replaced by one who wants to play for Tottenham, while also requesting an injury-free central defender. Levy has a war of words with Liverpool and Manchester United over their approaches for Robbie Keane, who is sold, and Berbatov, who is left unsettled, leaving Spurs with only one usable striker, while buying three playmakers and zero defenders. </p> <p>It is the reiteration of the error that exposes its cause. Levy is first and foremost a businessman for whom the finance and fine detail of a deal is the most important thing. For him its better to force an extra \u00a34m - and a negotiating victory - out of United than remove an unsettled and unsettling Berbatov from the camp and swap him for a player who will work for the team; cleverer accounting strategy to recruit youngsters with a potential resale value than a finished product in his late 20s. </p> <p>If Levy has spent heavily this window, with over \u00a345m committed on Luka Modric, David Bentley, Heurelho Gomes and Giovani Dos Santos, he has also recouped the best part of that sum in selling Keane, Kaboul, Paul Robinson, Steed Malbranque, Pascal Chimbonda, Teemu Tainio and Anthony Gardner. More importantly, the squad has been shunted into imbalance. </p> <p>From the 2007 soap opera in which Jol and Ramos struggled to deal with the desires of four senior strikers, Darren Bent has become the only properly employable forward. The midfield is overrun with individuals whose best position would be as a free-floating No10, yet Tottenham generally do not line up with one. There is neither a single natural holding midfielder nor an unarguable choice on the left wing. Bought two years ago to be the elusive defensive screen, Didier Zokora continues to be shoe-horned into various defensive roles he can not quite master, while there is only one reliable selection in the centre of defence and none at left-back. </p> <p>While some of this imbalance is being addressed by the acquisitions of Russia forward Roman Pavlyuchenko and Manchester City defender Vedran Corluka, the damage done by Tottenham's transfer window procrastination may already be too great to remedy. Six eminently winnable points have been lost to Middlesbrough and Sunderland in the club's two Premier League fixtures to date, and such is the present state of disrepair that few expect anything from Stamford Bridge this afternoon. </p> <p>In last season's Premier League, six points proved the difference between relegation and 13th place, between mid-table and the Uefa Cup and between the title and third place. A nine-point handicap hardly sits well with a club attempting to achieve a first-ever Champions League qualification. With each Premier League place worth \u00a3725,000 and access to the Champions League as much as 40 times more, Levy's parsimony may prove profligate. </p> <p>Left to hold the fort, Ramos is hardly happy about it. Quiz the Spaniard about the flaws in Tottenham's recruitment strategy and he will offer a knowing smile, delicately suggesting that it is an area beyond his own control. 'Without a doubt, it has had an awful lot to do with the start to the season,' he says. 'With the comings and goings, players are obviously trying their best to concentrate 100 per cent, but I think it has affected things slightly with their work on the training ground and even going into games. Our start has been affected by this. </p> <p>'It would have been great to have been a lot calmer. But you have to grin and bear it and get on with things. Certainly the ideal situation is that you get your squad settled early and you work with all the players in the pre-season period. Unfortunately on this occasion we have not been able to work with every player.' </p> <p>In contrast to his predecessor, Ramos refuses to criticise the club's inexperienced sporting director, Damien Comolli. After making obvious mistakes in recommending the likes of Boateng, Kaboul and Zokora, the Frenchman's own position is under review and it is not he who holds the final say on spending and selling. </p> <p>'The contact [with Comolli] is daily; we have an excellent relationship,' Ramos says. 'We chat about everything and it is a very good working relationship. Every club works in it's own particular fashion. Here at Tottenham we have a system where the sporting director is in charge of transfers and we gain a consensus in conversation with him. Then it is the club itself that carries out the transfers at the end of the day. The person who has the capacity and the wherewithal to control the club is the chairman. That's what he's there for and that's what he does.' </p> <p>At Chelsea there is sparse sympathy for a manager who denied London's richest club last season's Carling Cup. So little that Luiz Felipe Scolari is prepared to paint Stamford Bridge as a place of relative of penury. </p> <p>'Look, I've brought in only one player at Chelsea - only Deco,' the Chelsea manager says. 'I think in this season Juande has brought in three, four or five, including Modric, Pavlyuchenko and Gomes, who started as a goalkeeper with me in Brazil. I put him in the [Cruzeiro] first team at 18 and now he's at Tottenham. At that time I had good vision. </p> <p>'I think this season Tottenham spent more money than us and bought four or five players. Chelsea have bought only Deco. I buy one player and sell seven.' </p> <p>If Scolari is playing mind games - ignoring the multi-million pay rises handed to Frank Lampard, Petr Cech and Michael Essien, while pressing for still more money to be poured into Robinho's ill-handled purchase - he does not seek to conceal the value his first Chelsea buy. Deco was considered essential, his transfer agreed as soon as Scolari signed on the dotted line. The player was in place for a whole pre-season so that Chelsea could be rebuilt around him. </p> <p>'It's not just that he [Deco] is a good player; other teams maybe need one player or two players to mark him and that opens the space for other players in our team,' Scolari says. 'He's a unique player, one of the best in the world. If you remember [Zinedine] Zidane; when he played you expected a different way. Deco isn't Zidane, but it's near. You expect something and something changes.' </p> <p>Unlike Tottenham, where they expect, but nothing ever changes.</p> <p><strong>SIGNED SO FAR</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7 David Bentley</strong>, 23, \u00a317m</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 Luka Modric</strong>, 22, \u00a316.6m</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 Heurelho Gomes</strong>, 27, \u00a37m</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 Giovani Dos Santos</strong>, 19, \u00a34.7m</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 John Bostock</strong>, 16, \u00a3700k</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 Roman Pavlyuchenko</strong>, 26, undisclosed</p> <p><strong>REMAINING TARGETS</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7 Andrei Arshavin</strong>, 27, Zenit St Petersburg. </p> <p>Has been a target all summer - move now depends on Dimitar Berbatov's move to Manchester United and Zenit finding a replacement before the window shuts. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Kanout\u00e9</strong>, 30, Sevilla. </p> <p>Close to Juande Ramos, but denies he plans to move back to London.

  "<p>Senior British military commanders in Afghanistan have been told to change their military tactics in the face of mounting civilian casualties.</p> <p>Philip Alston, United Nations special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, warned Nato-led coalition forces, including Britain, that rules of engagement need to be revised or the coalition risks losing the war.</p> <p>There was a worrying but growing perception among Afghans that the foreign forces were responsible for 'indiscriminate killings' and 'mass rape'. </p> <p>'The struggle in Afghanistan is quintessentially at a point where popular support is crucial,' Alston said. 'My view is that it is being significantly undermined by the strong perception among the Afghan public that the allied forces are killing significant numbers of civilians with no accountability at all, even if that perception is exaggerated.'</p> <p>Nato's military command needed to alter its approach if it was to win popular support and triumph. Alston accused officials of blocking his attempts to discover details of the rules of engagement under which Nato troops were fighting.</p> <p>'There has been no acknowledgement from Nato that there is a problem in relation to civilian casualties and how it is dealt with and still there is no transparency on the issue.'</p> <p>Afghan president Hamid Karzai has ordered that any foreign military operations be subject to a new set of rules enforceable under international law. </p> <p>The UN condemnation of international operations will deepen the unease in Whitehall that British forces risk losing the hearts of the Afghan public. </p> <p>The Ministry of Defence is investigating a rocket attack in which British troops accidentally killed four civilians, including women and children.</p> <p>A separate UN inquiry last week found 60 children had been killed in US-led coalition air strikes in western Afghanistan. British forces in Helmand province routinely call in American air strikes when they come under attack. </p> <p>Internal US air force figures reveal that 272 tonnes of bombs were dropped on Afghanistan during June and July - the same amount dropped on the country during all of 2006. At least 500 civilians have died this year as a result of the actions of foreign forces. </p> <p>'[The coalition] told me that their rules of engagement hadn't changed which is strange. If you look at the increased use of aerial bombing, the numbers don't seem to add up,' said Alston. </p> <p>His chief concern was night raids by foreign intelligence agencies which appeared to take place without accountability to the Afghan government and left those subjected to them with three choices. 'They can either stay in their home and run the risk of being shot in their bed. Secondly, they could try and run, in which they would be shot, or thirdly, they fire back in which case they are treated as a terrorist and shot.' </p> <p>A growing consensus was emerging among Afghans that foreign forces were raping women. 'There is also a cultural element which seems to be that if a male [soldier] goes into a female's bedroom it is perceived as the equivalent of rape.'</p> <p>An MoD spokesman said: 'The UK military carry out detailed planning and use precision weapons when targeting enemy strongholds. Sadly, even with all these measures, there is still a risk of civilian casualties, particularly given the Taliban preference for basing themselves in public buildings.'</p>",
  "<p>We reached a landmark in technology last week when the number of computers stolen or lost containing highly sensitive information about people's bank details for the first time exceeded the number of computers available for purchase in the high street. </p> <p>Nowadays, stolen or lost information is so commonplace that at most recycling centres next to the bins marked 'green glass' and 'small plastic' are fresh ones labelled 'highly sensitive information.'</p> <p>My recycling centre has always tried to be more specific in its binning system, so it now has dumping areas codified into specific bits of sensitive information: yellow bins are for 'Confidential Data On Memory Sticks That, If It Fell Into The Wrong Hands Could Endanger Our Troops', while purple bins are for 'Missing CDs That Contain The Medical Records Of All Of BBC1's Sports Presenters'.</p> <p>The fact though is that, despite the mislaying of everything from the Prime Minister's Pin number to instructions on how to carry out a devastating anthrax attack on central London using just two bags of fertiliser, nothing horrible has actually happened. All house owners with surnames with initial letters from M to P in Sunderland have not had their bank accounts systematically raided, nor have all families owning dogs called Charlie had their back doors broken down and pets burnt.</p> <p>The truth is that all this sensitive information going missing is going missing on memory sticks and CDs - the very last things any of us look at. How many of us have returned from holidays with at least 1,000 photographs of our family holding up yellow drinks but never to get round to printing a single one of them? </p> <p>How many of us have downloaded and burned episodes of Prison Break on to DVDs that have piled up unwatched on top of unwatched but bought piles of Prison Break? Even if I had a pile of DVDs marked 'Embarrassing Footage Of Cabinet Ministers Taken By CCTV Cameras At London Zoo' and a memory stick containing a folder marked 'Johnny Depp's Bank Details', I know I'll probably never get round to doing anything about them. </p> <p>Instead, these and all the other extremely vital detritus that fills our living space will sink unwatched, unread and unattended, on to the floor, crushed and pulped by the weight of all our other wastage, until, over the millenniums, it's broken down and fossilised. It's sobering to know that, many thousands of years from now, a tree will bloom in some rainforest formed partly out of the atoms of an abandoned and unread folder containing the exact time and location of the five-second period twice a week that George W Bush doesn't have any security guards near him.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the law of averages would dictate that not just the good guys leave valuable information lying around in pubs. Somewhere in some Suffolk wine bar, fallen into a large basket inhabited by the landlord's labrador, there's a CD with all the details, maps, codes, getaway vehicle information and list of intended hostages if things go wrong of the biggest bank raid in history. </p> <p>The chances are we'll find it, not by scouring the county for clues, but by putting up bins in recycling centres marked 'Criminals' Paperwork'.</p> <h2>Grade A secrets</h2> <p>I came across a potential golden egg of information last year when I was filming an episode of The Thick of It. A lot of it was set in civil servants' offices and we were shooting in a disused business park that needed filling with documents and thousands of pieces of paper with figures. There are prop manufacturers who supply you with these things. I always imagined they made them specially, getting a computer to generate randomly loads of words and numbers and then maybe put everything through a machine that crumples the papers to make them look more careworn. </p> <p>Actually, the paperwork is bought as a job-lot from other businesses which are done with theirs. You'd think they'd sift it first for sensitive information, but I discovered that's not what happens when I went over to a shelf full of documents on set and pulled out Michael Grade's tax returns from three years previously and all the paperwork and documentation relating to his purchase of a yacht. </p> <p>It made fascinating reading for the entire film crew and cast, but put me in a career quandary. There I was holding the tax returns of a major public figure and there was I, a minor public satirist, who could do something with them. Obviously, I should have some fun with this. I couldn't let Michael Grade go yachting without awkwardness. Yet, on the other hand, he'd been very supportive of the very show we were filming. Indeed, we filmed part of it in his BBC office. Yet again, back on the first hand, he was Michael Grade. And he had a yacht. Which he could clearly afford on his net profit. </p> <p>What should I do? In the end, I decided to do the only honourable thing I could, which was to abdicate all responsibility. I left it to Fate to determine Michael Grade's fortune.

  "<p>Russia's strategy to revise the post-Soviet order in what it calls its \"near abroad\" will be pursued with even more perseverance following its victory over Georgia. Europe should have no illusions about this and should begin to prepare itself. But, as the European Union ponders what to do, cold realism, not hysterical overreaction, is in order. </p> <p>Unfortunately, equating the current situation in the Caucasus with the Soviet Union's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague_Spring\">invasion of Czechoslovakia</a> in 1968 does not attest to this kind of realism. Neither the west nor Nato constitutes the decisive strategic threat facing Russia, which comes from the Islamic south and from the Far East, in particular the emerging superpower, China. Moreover, Russia's strength is in no way comparable to that of the former Soviet Union. </p> <p>Indeed, demographically, Russia is undergoing a dramatic decline. Apart from commodity exports, it has little to offer to the global economy. Notwithstanding booming oil and gas revenues, its infrastructure remains underdeveloped, and successful economic modernisation is a long way off. Likewise, its political and legal system is authoritarian, and its numerous minority problems remain unsolved. As a result, Russia's current challenging of the territorial integrity of Georgia might prove to be a grave error in the not-so-distant future. </p> <p>Given this structural weakness, the idea of a new Cold War is misleading. The Cold War was an endurance race between two similarly strong rivals, the weaker of which eventually had to give up. Russia does not have the capacity to wage another struggle of that type. Nevertheless, as a restored great power, the new Russia will for the time being attempt to ride in the slipstream of other great powers for as long as doing so coincides with its possibilities and interests; it will concentrate on its own sphere of influence and on its role as a global energy power; and it will otherwise make use of its opportunities on a global scale to limit America's power. But it will not be able to seriously challenge the United States \u2013 or looking towards the future, China \u2013 in ways that the Soviet Union once did. </p> <p>It is now clear that in the future, Russia will once again pursue its vital interests with military force \u2013 particularly in its \"near abroad\". But Europe must never accept a renewal of Russian great power politics, which operates according to the idea that might makes right. Indeed, it is here that Russia's renewed confrontation with the west begins, because the new Europe is based on the principle of the inviolability of boundaries, peaceful conflict resolution, and the rule of law, so to forgo this principle for the benefit of imperial zones of influence would amount to self-abandonment. Further eastward expansion of Nato, however, will be possible only against fierce Russian resistance. Nor will this kind of policy in any way create more security, because it entails making promises that won't be kept in an emergency \u2013 as we now see in Georgia. </p> <p>For too long, the west has ignored Russia's recovery of strength and was not prepared to accept the consequences. But not only Russia has changed; so has the entire world. America's neo-conservatives have wasted a large part of their country's power and moral authority in an unnecessary war in Iraq, weakening the only global western power. China, India, Brazil, Russia, and the Persian Gulf today are the world economy's new growth centers and will soon be centers of power to be reckoned with. In view of these realities, the threat of exclusion from the G8 doesn't really feel earth shattering to Russia. Europe's disunity and impotence underline this image of a West that has partially lost touch with geo-political realities. </p> <p>The response to the return of Russia's imperial great power politics has nothing to do with punishing Russia, and a lot to do with establishing innately Western \u2013 especially European \u2013 positions of power. This requires several measures: </p> <p>\u0095 A new political dynamism vis-\u00e0-vis Turkey to link this country, one crucial for European security, permanently to Europe; </p> <p>\u0095 Putting a stop to Moscow's divide-and-conquer politics by adopting a common EU energy policy; </p> <p>\u0095 Serious initiative for strengthening Europe's defence capabilities; </p> <p>\u0095 A greater EU commitment to Ukraine to safeguard its independence; </p> <p>\u0095 A greater freedom of travel for all the EU's Eastern neighbours. </p> <p>All of this, and much more, is needed to send a clear signal to Russia that Europe is unwilling to stand idly by as it returns to great power politics. </p> <p>Presumably, none of this will happen, and it is precisely such inaction that is, in large part, the cause of Russia's strength and Europe's weakness. At the same time, however, one shouldn't lose sight of the joint interests linking Russia and the west. Cooperative relations should be maintained as far as possible. </p> <p>It is blatantly obvious that for Russia's elites, weakness and cooperation are mutually exclusive. Therefore, whoever wants cooperation with Russia \u2013 which is in Europe's interest \u2013 must be strong. That is the lesson from the violence in the Caucasus that Europe must urgently take to heart. </p> <p><strong>Copyright: <a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org\">Project Syndicate</a>/Institute for Human Sciences, 2008.</strong></p>",
  "<p>St Helens successfully defended their Carnegie Challenge Cup at Wembley this afternoon, beating an injury-ravaged Hull FC 28-16 courtesy of two tries from Francis Meli and one each for Matt Gidley, Jon Wilkin, Gareth Raynor and Leon Pryce. Hull briefly led 10-12 in the 63rd minute when Kirk Yeaman touched down for the second time in the match, but four late tries wrapped up a third consecutive Challenge Cup victory for Saints.</p> <p>Hull's day got off to a bad start when the Australian scrum-half Adam Dykes failed to shake off a long-standing knee injury and was replaced by Tommy Lee, with Richard Horne named on the bench for his first appearance in four months following a career-threatening neck injury. Todd Byrne replaced the injured Motu Tony at full-back.</p> <p>St Helens, on the other hand, were able to name the England forward Maurie Fa'asavalu on the bench after he shook off a hamstring injury. The club captain Paul Sculthorpe was named at loose forward in his last cup final for the club he has served for a decade. </p> <p>But Sculthorpe's afternoon was brought to an abrupt end within the first two minutes, as he was led from the field nursing an apparent broken arm after a collision with Byrne. Hull then carved out the first chance of the game and could have gone ahead had Gareth Raynor's knock-down from Lee's kick bounced more kindly for Willie Manu.</p> <p>But as they often do, Saints hit straight back and after a knock-on from Byrne the ball was sent wide to Paul Wellens who drew in two tackles before handing Matt Gidley the simplest of opening tries with seven minutes gone. A neat kick from Shaun Berrigan nearly forced Meli into an error and provide Matt Sing with a score as Hull probed for a response, although they were fortunate to see Ade Gardner spill possession as he powered his way over after another error from Sing.</p> <p>Horne was introduced after 17 minutes and was dumped to the ground after 10 seconds by James Graham, before Graham was again at his best creating an opportunity for Meli to race the length of the field and score after shaking off the attentions of Sing. Sean Long slotted his first conversion for a 10-point lead. </p> <p>Some strong running from Sing nearly created a try for Graeme Horne in the corner, but the pair's defensive partnership was proving costly for Hull as both Meli and Willie Talau made light work of shaking them off at will. With Hull losing possession regularly, it took some heroic defending to stop Wellens and Gardner stretching the holder's lead, before referee Steve Ganson ruled out a try for Talau following a forward pass from Fa'asavalu.</p> <p>Despite only leading by 10 at half-time, St Helens were in complete control and could have had a third score just before the hooter, only for the video referee to deem that Meli made a double movement when squeezing in at the corner.</p> <p>As the second half got under way, Agar's beleaguered side soon received a timely boost as Yeaman picked off a pass from Cunningham to race 80 metres to the line, with Danny Tickle slotting the goal to bring the deficit to four points. Hull were looking more comfortable and there looked to be a good chance of a dramatic comeback, especially when a rare error from Wellens provided Hull with some excellent field position and this time they were able to cash in, as Richard Horne and Manu combined to send Yeaman powering over for his second try to level the scores. Tickle kept his composure to slot the goal from the touchline and edge his side in front.</p> <p>But as champions sides do, Saints responded almost instantly and were soon back in front when Pryce resisted Horne's tackle to stand a pass up to Meli who slipped in for his second try. Long matched Tickle to slot the goal from out wide.</p> <p>Jon Wilkin then charged down Danny Washbrook's kick and collected the loose ball to race unchallenged to the line. Hull did hint at another comeback with Gareth Raynor's try in the corner but it proved to be in vain as Pryce rounded things off with a late solo effort from close range.</p>",
  "<p><br>Giancarlo Giametti, Valentino Garavini and Matt Tyrnauer - wearing white, even though it's obviously before six pm. Photo: AFP/Damien Meyer</p> <p>The secret to making a decent movie about the fashion world is to know nothing about fashion. That is certainly the case with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/aug/29/venicefilmfestival.fashion\">Matt Tyrnauer's Valentino - The Last Emperor</a>, the feature documentary about venerable Italian fashion designer Valentino Garavini that premiered in Venice last Friday</p> <p>Tyrnauer, who is currently making a film about writer Gore Vidal, is an \"editor at large\" for Vanity Fair. He freely admits that he is no Anna Wintour or Suzy Menkes. His interest was far more in the lost world of La Dolce Vita - the world of Fellini and Pasolini, the old Italy of the 60s when you could find Anita Ekberg bathing in the Trevi Fountain while Marcello Mastroianni was looking soulful in the background. To hammer home the point, Tyrnauer fills his movie with music from Nino Rota, who scored Fellini's movies.</p> <p>Valentino has been a star of the fashion world for well-nigh half a century. In that time, he has given countless interviews to fashion journalists. He and his business partner (and lover) Giancarlo Giametti are well-accustomed to manipulating the press. They are treated by the media as if they are old-fashioned royalty. Tyrnauer met them when he was writing a piece on Valentino for Vanity Fair and persuaded them to be the subjects of his movie. The journalist turned documentary maker then spent two years chronicling their lives.</p> <p>His approach is affectionate but also very mischievous. The camera intrudes on some very private moments - for example, some extravagantly over-the-top tiffs between Giametti and Valentino in which they criticise each other's appearances or bicker about how many tassels there should be on a dress.</p> <p>Versailles during the time of Marie Antoinette can't have been any more lavish than the milieu that the designers and their pet dogs inhabit. Valentino travels with a retinue. If there is a spot of rain, someone will always be there to put an umbrella over his head. He even employs someone to brush his dogs' teeth.</p> <p>\"I love the Italian over-the-top way of living. In Italy, it exists from the lowest income to the highest. There is a certain flair... but this (Valentino's lifestyle) is at a level that doesn't exist on earth any more,\" the director notes. \"They are art directors of their own lives. They live art directed lives that they self-direct.\"</p> <p>Despite their wealth, Giametti and Valentino are utterly compelling figures. They're waspish, funny and perceptive - and always immaculately groomed. Both also have a vulnerability about them utterly lacking in Valentino's friend Karl Lagerfeld (who looks disconcertingly like Klaus Kinski on leave a Werner Herzog movie about a mad obsessive).</p> <p>The film, we soon realise, is more about their relationship than it is a study of the high fashion world that they inhabit. \"Valentino and Giancarlo could have been poor. They could have been walnut farmers from near Pompeii and they still would have been fascinating if they had the same dynamic,\" Tyrnauer says of his subjects.</p> <p>Valentino dressed Jackie Kennedy, Babe Paley, Marella Agnelli and many of the other grandes dames of the 60s. He belongs to an era of high glamour that long since passed but he designs as if that world still exists. It is this aspect that gives the documentary an elegiac feel. Valentino is one of the last links with that lost world.</p> <p>With his outsider's eye, Tyrnauer is far more perceptive about Valentino than all those fashion commentators who are either too close to him or too deferential to spot his foibles. Valentino, meanwhile, had his own opinions (invariably withering) about Tyrnauer's dress sense. \"He (Valentino) is a very formal man. He wears a coat and tie every day, even if he is not going to work. He never drops his standards,\" the chastened filmmaker notes. \"He said to me that if he saw me in a blue shirt one more time, he would scream. Then I wore white during the day and he said 'my darling, white is for after 6 o'clock'.\"</p> <p>For more on Venice 2008, click <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/venicefilmfestival\">here</a></p>",
  "<p>Sarah Palin sounded as though she had won the lottery.

  "<p>Mark Lawson is right <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/29/military.defence\">to be enraged</a> by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/aug/02/theatre\">Deep Cut</a>, the play, and, if my experience is anything to go by, everything further he now reads or learns about the case will only make him more enraged. But what nobody should expect, now or in the future \u2013 even if there should be a proper public inquiry - is a definitive answer to the question: how did these four young recruits die? </p> <p>That is impossible because the opportunity to gather all the relevant evidence at the time of the deaths was wasted by the police and the army, and that evidence is now lost forever. This means that the best a public inquiry can do, so far as the deaths themselves are concerned, is to get all the facts into the public domain. <br> That in itself would be worthwhile, and more than worthwhile so far as the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/video/2008/aug/08/deepcut.interview\">bereaved families</a> are concerned. They have the right to all the information that the authorities have been so doggedly withholding down the years. </p> <p>But it should only be the beginning of an inquiry's work. After that, we need to know why the police and army investigations \u2013 even after four deaths \u2013 were so slapdash, and we need to know who takes responsibility for that. By that I mean, which officers, by name.</p> <p>And then what I see as the most important work of the inquiry should begin. Taken together, the four deaths were the most extreme symptoms of what we now know was an appalling failure by the army and the government in their duty of care towards teenage recruits, a failure that continued for nearly a decade. </p> <p>Deepcut barracks was a holding centre for 17- and 18-year-olds of both sexes who were just out of basic training. It was ill-conceived, poorly organised and grossly understaffed \u2013 and of the staff it had quite a few were scandalously unsuited to working with young people. As a result, the place was out of control, or, as one witness put it, Deepcut was like Glasgow on a Saturday night. No one who knew what was going on should ever have been surprised that there were deaths, though of course the parents who watched their sons and daughters go off there had no idea.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/hc0506/hc07/0795/0795.asp\">Nicholas Blake's deeply flawed review</a>, conducted for the MoD, held no one to account for this dreadful failure, but even he admitted that it was a matter of luck only four trainees died in this period (which runs roughly from 1993 to 2002).</p> <p>A proper public inquiry would establish, by name, who was responsible for this, who took the decisions that made it possible, and who ducked the decisions that could have prevented or halted it. These people were warned, repeatedly, that Deepcut was a mess, and a dangerous one, yet they did not fix it until far too late \u2013 until the public found out that there had been four deaths.</p> <p>We hear a lot about accountability and responsibility in the public service. So far as I know, no police officer, army officer, civil servant or politician (and yes, this goes to government level) has ever been disciplined or reprimanded for a failure of responsibility in this affair.</p> <p>Imagine this had been a private institution, perhaps an independent boarding school for sixth formers or an adventure holiday camp, and something of this kind had happened. Do you think those in charge would have walked away? </p> <p>Philip Ralph's remarkable play enrages those who see it because the story is a shocking one, and through his play he makes the case for a public inquiry in a way that journalists like myself have somehow failed to do. But if we demand an inquiry we need to get the question for that inquiry right.</p> <p>That question, in my view, should not be: were these deaths suicides? As I say, that is unanswerable, and the muddle and anticlimax involved in reaching that unsatisfactory conclusion would only serve the interests of the MoD. The question should be: who allowed Deepcut to become a place where four people could die in this way? That is the question that really scares the ministers and the top brass.</p>",
  "<p>The former world No1 and tournament second seed Roger Federer turned in another sloppy performance in the second round of the US Open at Flushing Meadows, but still overcame the relatively unknown Brazilian Thiago Alves in straight sets. Federer had nearly as many unforced errors as winners during a 6-3, 7-5, 6-4 victory over the 26-year-old Alves, who is ranked 137th in the world.</p> <p>The third seed and reigning Australian Open champion, Novak Djokovic was also tested by the unseeded American Robert Kendrick before progressing 7-6 (10-8), 6-4, 6-4. Andy Roddick, seeded eight, also struggled in his second round match against Latvia's Ernests Gulbis and needed four sets and just under three hours before triumphing 3-6, 7-5, 6-2, 7-5. </p> <p>\"Tonight was one of those ones that I won on effort,\" said Roddick, the 2003 champion. \"Thanks to [the crowd], you kept me in it when I was losing it. So, thank you.\"</p> <p>Much like Federer, Roddick is not having the type of season he expected in 2008. He lost in third round at the Australian Open, sat out the French Open and suffered a second-round exit at Wimbledon. He was in danger of continuing that dismal pattern here, dropping the first set and falling behind 5-4 in the second, before breaking Gulbis's serve to make it five-all. Roddick then took that set and won the first three games of the third to take control of the match.</p> <p>\"He definitely outplayed me for the [first part of the match], but the clock struck midnight and I started playing like a 26-year-old,\" said Roddick, whose birthday is today.</p> <p>Trying to salvage one Grand Slam in a disappointing year, Federer advanced to a third-round meeting against the No28 seed Radek Stepanek of the Czech Republic or Australian Chris Guccione. \"These are the early-round matches, so it will only get better from here,\" said Federer, who won his 600th career match. \"I was never really in danger, so it was actually pretty good for me.\"</p> <p>The 21-year-old Djokovic, who seemed to show no ill affects from the ankle injury he suffered in the third set of his first-round victory over Frenchman Arnaud Clement, saved a set point in the first set tie-break against Kendrick after squandering a 6-2 lead. Djokovic, who received treatment on both knees after the first set, eventually wore down Kendrick with 34 winners and only 13 unforced errors. The American had 46 winners but 30 unforced errors.</p> <p>In an earlier second-round match Friday, No1 seed Fernando Gonzalez of Chile survived an injury scare to get past Bobby Reynolds 7-6 (8-6), 6-4, 6-4. Down 2-0 in the second set, Gonzalez suffered a sprained left ankle. But he recovered after getting his ankle re-taped during an injury time-out.</p> <p>The fifth seed Nikolay Davydenko of Russia, also progressed, ousting Argentina's Agustin Calleri 6-4, 6-4, 7-6 (7-2). Other seeded winners included Fernando Gonzalez, Fernando Verdasco, Tommy Robredo, Nicolas Almagro, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, Igor Andreev, Dmitry Tursunov, Radek Stepanek, Marin Cilic and Andreas Seppi. Seppi will take on Roddick in the third round. Unseeded players to advance were Finland's Jarkko Nieminen and Gilles Muller of Luxembourg.</p>",
  "<p>Back in 2000, Gordon Brown promised that \"within 10-20 years no one should be seriously disadvantaged by where they live\". Since then, the government's neighbourhood renewal fund has tried to improve employment, health, housing and schools in our most deprived areas. Progress has been made, but not enough. </p> <p>Two reports this week show that inequalities within and between our cities are still very stark. Far too many people are still disadvantaged by where they live. </p> <p>The UK now has 3 million households where no one is in full-time work, according to the <a href=\"http://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/Prep/8552.asp\">Office of National Statistics</a>. That affects almost 1.8 million children in Britain \u2013 one in seven. Most of these families live in the most run-down parts of our cities. Your chances of being in full-time work are much lower in Hull than in Cambridge. </p> <p>Life expectancy is also massively different depending on where you live, according to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/aug/28/health.socialexclusion\">World Health Organisation</a>. If you live in Calton in Glasgow, your neighbours on average die aged 54. But if you live in nearby Lenzie, you can expect to live until 82. In London, average life expectancy in leafy Hampstead is 11 years longer than in St Pancras, just a couple of miles down the road.</p> <p>Poor health is not just the result of the so-called \"postcode lottery\" in the NHS. It's due to the wider urban environment in our poorest communities. Low employment rates and low incomes. Poor schools and housing. These all contribute to the poor health and short life expectancy in places like Calton.</p> <p>One way to tackle poor health is to raise employment rates in the poorest bits of our cities. Overall, the UK has more people in work than ever before. But we still have too many areas with too many people not in employment, and these are concentrated in many of our cities. </p> <p>Recent research from the Centre for Cities confirmed that worklessness is <a href=\" http://www.centreforcities.org/index.php?id=537\">largely an urban problem</a>. England's cities contain 59% of the country's population, but over 68% of those claiming benefits and 64% of the workless. Cities such as Liverpool illustrate the scale of the challenge, with a quarter of its working-age population on benefits. That's almost double the English average. </p> <p>Worklessness is not just a problem for Britain's largest cities. Hull and Hastings also have very high proportions of their working-age population on benefits.</p> <p>Low employment and worklessness are an urban problem, and require a tailored, city-level solution. \"Postcode lottery\" may be a problem in the NHS, but it's not a universal problem. Our cities each need to take their own unique approach to worklessness, tailored to their own labour markets and the skills of their residents. </p> <p>Our cities also need more powers to increase their employment rates. There's been plenty of devolution talk from ministers. James Purnell recently promised more \"power to the people\" and \"triple devolution\" to people, service providers and communities. But we've not yet seen any radical devolution of financial or political powers to city leaders. </p> <p>One of the reasons why regeneration funding has under-delivered over the past decade has been the over-centralised way that government has spent it. New programmes, like the working neighbourhoods fund, will be more effective if they genuinely devolve funding and powers to people in communities and across real city economies. </p> <p>Cities such as Liverpool and Birmingham now need more freedom to take their own approach to tackling worklessness, based on the needs of their local labour markets. This means direct control over training budgets, through new powerful skills and employment boards. These would set budgets for local back-to-work and training programmes \u2013 using funds devolved from the DWP, Jobcentre Plus and the proposed Skills and Funding Agency.</p> <p>This is now happening in the capital with the London Skills and Employment Board, chaired by the mayor, Boris Johnson. It's starting to influence job training across London. It will allow London's employers to have a bigger say over training programmes, and should help to increase the capital's relatively low employment rate \u2013 which at 70% is well below the national rate of 75%. </p> <p>Increasing employment in our poorest areas will help to improve the health of people who live there. But trying to do all that from Whitehall will not work. Cities are best placed to sort out their own labour markets, with support from the centre. More powerful cities stand a better chance of improving employment prospects in their poorest areas. That's the best prescription for economic growth and healthy communities.</p> <p><em>This article was amended on Monday September 1, at 10.30am.</em></p>"
