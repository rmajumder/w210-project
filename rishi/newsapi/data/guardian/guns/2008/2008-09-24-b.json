  "<p>It has been a busy week in the world of sporting arbitration, with McLaren losing its appeal in Paris against Lewis Hamilton's 25-second penalty for overtaking Kimi Raikkonen at the Belgian grand prix and Sheffield United being vindicated by a ruling from an independent panel that West Ham must pay the Yorkshire club compensation over the Tevez Affair.</p> <p>Those who like to mix professional sport with amateur jurisprudence will be disappointed to note Hamilton has accepted the verdict against him, but no doubt delighted that West Ham are fighting back. The next stop for the London club is, apparently, Lausanne, home of the Court of Arbitration for Sport to appeal against the Tevez ruling, although not before the wise heads at the CAS take care of other business, of which there appears to be plenty.</p> <p>The debate over the law and its place in sport is an old one and is, by and large, settled, with the consensus being that other than in the most exceptional - ie. self-evidently criminal - cases it is best if sport regulates itself.</p> <p>This is a sensible state of affairs although it has left some sports with a problem, especially in an era when there is so much at stake financially. It is against this backdrop that the dispute over Carlos Tevez's period as a West Ham player during the 2006-07 season and the impact (or otherwise) he had on Sheffield United's relegation from the Premier League came before an arbitration panel headed by Lord Griffiths, a specialist mediator in the world of insurance and commerce. He is also a former president of the MCC and former captain of the R&amp;A.</p> <p>There is no doubt Lord Griffiths is a distinguished lawyer, and also that he has an interest in sport, but it does not change the fact that he and his fellow panel members had no right to reach a decision based on this crucial assumption: \"We have no doubt that those [Tevez's] services were worth at least three points to West Ham over the season and were what made the difference between West Ham remaining in the Premier League and being relegated.\"</p> <p>How could they say this? On the basis of the evidence provided by the former Sheffield United manager Neil Warnock, who said yesterday: \"West Ham's lawyers used my book against us and picked out passages where I said a referee had cost us here, or a mistake there, but the tribunal obviously agreed with me when I said that Carlos Tevez had been instrumental\"? </p> <p>Or that of the man from the Daily Telegraph, who insisted Tevez's performance against Manchester United (he scored in a 1-0 victory) was the reason the London club stayed up yet in his report named goalkeeper Robert Green as man of the match? </p> <p>This isn't to say that either of these witnesses were wrong, only that they were no more able than Lord Griffiths to state with certainty that Tevez was worth more than three points to West Ham, and that he was therefore the reason the club avoided relegation. This conclusion might sit uncomfortably with Sheffield United fans, not least because their club is justified in arguing it was wronged - if not by West Ham, then certainly by the Premier League, which failed to impose a tougher penalty after its myriad obfuscations when asked to explain its dealings with those who owned the Argentinian's playing rights. It might also grate with those who view arbitration panels as a necessary buffer between sport and the law courts. Without Lord Griffiths and his ilk, the only place left for an aggrieved party is the Royal Courts of Justice, it could be argued.</p> <p>Such fears can be easily countered. The problem is not arbitration, but the failure of those who arbitrate to understand that in sport some things are unknowable or at least cannot be measured beyond the boundaries of speculation. The precise contribution of an individual to a club over the course of a football season is one of those things.</p> <p><strong>Van Commenee shows an uncommon touch</strong></p> <p>Charles van Commenee's appointment as the new head coach of UK Athletics has been universally welcomed. He is, by all accounts, smart, committed and tougher than a 50p sirloin. Apparently, he reduced Kelly Sotherton to tears after she won bronze at the 2004 Olympics, calling her a wimp for failing to win silver. I'm not sure this is much of a recommendation, but we will let it pass as long he continues to display the humanity shown when he was questioned about Dwain Chambers. \"He has served his sentence, he is more than welcome back in the team. Everybody who serves their sentence is welcome,\" he replied. Chambers was a drugs cheat but his treatment at the hands of the athletics establishment - and the law courts - is one of the great sporting hypocrisies. Most people believe the sprinter's best days are gone, but at least he will now have the chance to compete in a sport he is clearly devoted to.</p> <p><strong>Wenger's secret cannot be put into words</strong></p> <p>The most successful sports psychologist, and one of the most interesting characters, I have ever met is a Belgian fellow by the name Jos Vanstiphout, who has made a tremendous living tending to the needs of golf professionals, despite having no professional qualifications in the field of psychology, only the lessons learned from a varied life which has seen him sing lead vocals in a Belgian pop band and sell classified adverts for a newspaper company. Vanstiphout's list of clients includes some of the best, not least Ernie Els, who has relied heavily on his advice. Their record together speaks volumes, although it has never been able to extinguish my natural scepticism for sports psychology. </p> <p>There is even less chance of that happening now after the publication of the \"secret\" motivational document apparently circulated by Ars\u00e8ne Wenger to the Arsenal squad. Stick together, the document implores, along with other banalities, the majority of which you might pick up if you spent 10 minutes watching the Oprah Winfrey Show; display a positive attitude, always want more, and so forth. If Wenger believes these personal affirmations are essential to the development of a top-class player then who are we to doubt him, although his document does appear to have omitted a rather more essential requirement for those who want to succeed at the Emirates: be very, very good at football.</p> <p><strong>What did Triggs do to end up in the doghouse?</strong></p> <p>Those who haven't noticed before that Roy Keane is not an especially sentimental man may have heard that the Sunderland manager has got a new dog. \"A German shepherd,\" he announced proudly. But what of Triggs, the labrador who was Keane's faithful companion during the turbulent years at Old Trafford? \"I'm taking the lead role, as you'd expect, the German shepherd has taken over and he's second in charge. Poor old Triggs is at the back,\" Keane revealed. Poor old Triggs indeed. Now he is no longer top dog in the Keane household, maybe there is a lower division manager out there who would sign him on a flea transfer.</p>",

He spoke about the hindrances she faced from her enemies. \"In the name of Jesus, in the name of Jesus, every form of witchcraft is what you rebuke. In the name of Jesus, in the name of Jesus, father make away now,\" Muthee said.</p> <p>In a video that emerged last week Palin, in a speech to the church on June 8, thanked Muthee for his help in getting her elected governor. She said his invocation was \"very, very powerful\". </p> <p>The Democratic candidate, Barack Obama, faced weeks of damaging reports this year over links to controversial Chicago pastor Jeremiah Wright, who was accused of being unpatriotic. The links between Palin and Muthee have the potential to damage her.</p> <p>The Christian Science Monitor reported that Muthee, while in Kenya, led a campaign to find the source of alleged witchcraft after a series of fatal car accidents in Kiambu. He blamed a local woman called Mama Jane, who is reported to have been forced to leave.</p> <p>Muthee, in a promotional video, said: \"We prayed, we fasted, the lord showed us a spirit of witchcraft over the place.\"</p> <p>McCain's team has largely kept Palin away from the media. But she faces a debate with her opposite number, Joe Biden, next week.</p>",
  "<p>The American fashion director and former model Lynn Kohlman, who has died of cancer aged 62, presented herself as the beautiful public body of cancer. She posed for the camera unclothed with both breasts gone, with titanium staples encircling her scalp after a brain operation, with hair frazzled away by radiation. In a radical gesture consistent with her life, she published proximate portraits of her youthful perfection and post-op, scarred self, defiantly lovely, in her autobiography, Lynn Front to Back, published in 2005. </p> <p>Kohlman had modelled in her student years after the photographer Clive Arrowsmith spotted her on a London street. Then, as a graduate in art history, she moved from her native New Jersey to Italy to do restoration work after the Florence floods of 1966. She thought modelling was \"inane\", but it paid, and her looks were liked in Europe in the 1970s - her short, dark hair so different from the prevaling taste for curly girlies, her long, lean face harking back to a pre-60s sophistication, though not clarted with makeup. She was a cover girl for Elle, Harpers &amp; Queen, and French Vogue, and she twirled on Paris and London catwalks, lanky enough to carry off the acres of fabric in a Zandra Rhodes ensemble. She travelled to Africa and India, and learned how the photographers Barry Lategan, Irving Penn and Richard Avedon worked.</p> <p>Photography became Kohlman's back-up career after she returned to New York in the early 1980s. The model agency boss Eileen Ford told her she would need a nose job before she was acceptable for modelling assignments in the US. And the crew cut, motorbike boots and Patti Smith style would have to go. </p> <p>She did have American fans, notably the designer Perry Ellis, who produced a collection based on the oversized man's linen suit she wore. Kohlman wrote that she thought of herself \"as his muse, but he gave me the title assistant designer\", and she led the parade at his shows. She shot ads for, and portraits of, him and Calvin Klein. Andy Warhol rated her portfolio highly enough to offer her space in Interview magazine, and Vogue commissioned her behind the camera. Besides fashion and portraits, she photographed landscapes.</p> <p>Donna Karan employed her in 1988, first as fashion director, then as creative director, and always as inspiration. Kohlman's edginess and \"masculine-feminine street feeling\" became a basis of Karan's urban DKNY look. Then, after 11 years with Karan, she was recruited by Tommy Hilfiger as creative director, but was swiftly dismissed. Despite an initial encounter with breast cancer in the 1990s, which required a lumpectomy, she remained fit until 2002. </p> <p>Then, that September, Kohlman asked a friend to practise spiritual healing on her son, Sam, and the friend warned Kohlman to check her breasts, as she was sure something was wrong. It was. Kohlman had cancer widespread enough to demand an immediate double mastectomy - as her mother had 30 years earlier.</p> <p>Kohlman enjoyed telling the story of her operations and their aftermath as outrageous comedy. She had expected to qualify for a new technology that created replacement \"breasts\" from her own body fat, only she lacked enough fat for one breast, let alone two. \"I was very baffled that I could be too fit or too thin.\" A reconstructive surgeon inserted \"expanders\" in her chest to stretch skin and muscles slowly so implants could be fitted. But after an infection, she had them extracted.</p> <p>At the end of a yoga class five months later, as she wrote in Vogue: \"It was as if hot snakes were wriggling through me ... my mouth tasted like metal.\" The class master claimed this was the joyful release of \"kundalini rising\", but she knew it was brain cancer. The precise diagnosis turned out to be stage four glioblastoma. \"Stage four out of 10, I asked? No, the doctor shook her head. Stage four out of four.\" Kohlman had to stay awake during the surgery to answer questions so the surgeons could be sure they were within the correct zone of the brain. Then they sealed her skull incision with 39 titanium staples. The tumour regrew in weeks; more chemotherapy, but no hiding. She was proud that she was shameless in what others thought of as her physical ruin. </p> <p>Karan considered the staples elegant and edgy, and so did Kohlman. As she told the Oprah Winfrey show in 2005, she had sauntered out onto the streets of New York with her scalp shaved and staples visible. A passing pierced punk admired them, so \"nicely spaced and even. That's cool. Where'd you have that done?\" </p> <p>Kohlman's first marriage ended in divorce. She is survived by her second husband, the documentary director Mark Obenhaus, and their son.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Lynn Eleanor Kohlman, model and fashion director, born August 12 1946; died September 14 2008</p>",
  "<p>Josephine Quintavalle (Letters, September 22) attempts to use history to attack women's rights to choose today. But why focus on interpretations of debates a century ago, when attitudes and realities on many issues have changed? The notion that diversity can be advanced by denying women the right to choose on abortion is untenable. This idea could only be put forward by someone who would elevate the status of every foetus over that of any woman. </p> <p>Women must be free to make the individual choice about abortion, in the complex circumstances they face. That is what will advance the interests of women, in all their diversity. If we are looking at history, why not consider the uncounted thousands who died from illegal abortion before the 1967 act. Or leave history behind and consider the estimated 70,000 women worldwide who die each year now? That position is recognised as intolerable by most people - including the 83% in this country who support choice on abortion. Josephine Quintavalle is entitled to her hardcore anti-abortion views, but she should let others make choices for themselves.<strong><br>Anne Kane</strong><br>Chair, Abortion Rights </p> <p>Josephine Quintavalle's diatribe against Marie Stopes would be more persuasive if she did not put words into Stopes' mouth: the expressions she cites appear nowhere in Stopes' essay in the 1920 volume Control of Parenthood. It is a passionate plea for women to be accorded the knowledge of birth control to enable them to space their pregnancies for the health of their children and their own wellbeing, along with demands for better provision for the knowledge of, and treatment for, sexually transmitted diseases. I am also rather surprised to hear that Stopes ever had a passion for abortion, since she claimed that wider knowledge of birth control would eradicate the need for it.<br><strong>Lesley Hall</strong><br>London</p>",
  "<p>Premier League football clubs are still using third-party arrangements to purchase players, even though the authorities cracked down on the practice following the Carlos Tevez affair, and the current method is far more damaging to clubs' financial well-being than the arrangements of the past. </p> <p>At its summer meeting this year the League stiffened its rules to prevent external companies holding stakes in footballers, amid fears that the control of \"economic rights\" would allow third parties to influence playing contracts. </p> <p>However, one recent high-profile deal between two English clubs saw the buying club engage a third-party firm to provide finance for the deal. Rather than sell an equity stake in the player, the club engaged a specialist football-loans company to provide it with a mortgage over the player's registration. </p> <p>The selling club demanded a 50% downpayment on the transfer, of which only half came from the buying club's cash reserves. The mortgage company is expected to pay all the outstanding debt on the transfer and will levy interest for its outlay on the buying club. </p> <p>This mechanism, which is understood to have been used in many other recent transfers, means that as the interest increases the buying club's liabilities, the player's value diminishes as his contract approaches expiry. The club thus loses out at both ends of the deal. </p> <h2>Hammers go home</h2> <p>Although West Ham United might seem to have more pressing concerns at the moment, they are set to hold talks about a possible move to the Olympic Stadium after 2012. The conversation will not last long once the Hammers see the costs involved. A feasibility study shows that the stadium cannot be converted into a football venue; furthermore, there would be construction costs of around \u00a3400m just to build a new 50,000-seat stadium - that bill would grow once demolition costs were thrown in. Despite the mayor of London's desire to see a football tenant at Stratford, insiders say the club's best and cheapest bet remains the vacant Parcelforce site in West Ham itself.</p> <h2>Gareth's middle way</h2> <p>Emanuel Pogatetz will not expect to escape censure from Gareth Southgate, pictured, for his vicious tackle on Manchester United's Rodrigo Possebon on Tuesday night on the basis that his manager is an old pal. Southgate found the transition from playing to management difficult, and he has since gone to great lengths to distance himself and his Middlesbrough management team from the playing staff. No coaches are allowed in the dressing rooms or players' relaxation areas and players and staff must eat on separate tables at lunch. Keeping his distance has worked so far: Southgate was named the first manager of the month of the Premier League season. </p> <h2>No man is an island</h2> <p>How interesting the Premier League should say there is \"no variance with information on record\" about the ownership of Portsmouth. It is a year since the League's chief executive, Richard Scudamore, appealed to the Treasury for help in uncovering the identity of offshore companies that own clubs. One such is Portsmouth's parent company, Miland Development (2004) Limited, a British Virgin Islands-registered business. Could it be that this is just the sort of obfuscation the Premier League has been trying to stamp out? Apparently not. The League says its appeal to government was about clubs whose owners are keen to hide their identities, and that Portsmouth's Alexandre Gaydamak disclosed everything, satisfying the League that he is the owner. So that's all right, then.</p> <h2>Ticket to deride</h2> <p>Only now does it become clear to Aegon what a \u00a325m sponsorship of the Lawn Tennis Association buys you. Apart from the tournament formally known as the Artois Championships, the biggest property in the LTA's calendar is the Davis Cup. Yet at the Wimbledon-staged World Group play-off last weekend the LTA could not give seats away. \"We did offer over 800 schools free tickets for the weekend, but only 16% took up the offer,\" said the LTA's chief executive, Roger Draper. </p>",
  "<p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>So it will fall to the French to keep the lights on; all part of our long march towards a nuclear future. The UK has a history of being very open to foreign capital, British Energy says, and as good Europeans we can hardly make too much fuss about the multibillion-pound purchase by EDF of our power plants. We'll leave that side of things to Ukip. All the same, it will be important to keep an eye on Gordon's cherished \"new generation\" of nuclear stations. Things go wrong. Someone must safeguard the public. That's why many are worried that the government appears to have been \"economical with the actualit\u00e9\" about its efforts to recruit a sufficient number of nuclear inspectors. Dai Davies MP asked a number of questions over the summer of Malcolm Wicks, the energy minister, and was told it is making progress in recruiting staff following recruitment campaigns begun late last year and in April. Not a problem, the minister said. But no one has told Alistair Darling, because just a fortnight ago he informed the TUC that, despite his reluctance to pay more to public-sector workers, he may well have to throw cash at nuclear inspectors because too few people are applying. Nothing we say will dissuade them from the nuclear path, so we won't even try that. But they could get their stories straight. That would be something.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>For it is a debate we all need to get involved in. On the other hand, we accept that some families are more nuclear than others. There's Tony Cooper, father of cabinet minister Yvette, who sits on the board of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority as a non-executive director. There is also Andrew Brown, who is director of communications at the all-conquering, aforementioned EDF Energy. His older brother is something in the government. It all helps. It gives perspective.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>For relationships matter: between parties; between the private sector and the Labour government. Some were a little startled at the Labour gala dinner on Tuesday when they realised the event was sponsored by United Utilities - provider of water, electricity and gas - and far from everyone's favourite within the union movement. But they supped, presumably with a long sort of spoon.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>So congratulations to EDF, and congratulations to Gate Gourmet, the airline caterer that sacked 670 staff by megaphone in 2005, causing chaos at Heathrow so extreme that the passengers all noticed. Things have since calmed down, and so it is that the firm can celebrate the receipt of a people management award from the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development and People Management Magazine. The category in which it excelled: \"management of change\". It may all seem a sick joke to the sacked employees who even now are still campaigning for better compensation but the nasty Texans who once ran the company have gone, and there does seem to be a general recognition that the leopard's spots, if not quite changed, are much, much less visible. The sinner repenteth. What joy.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Congrats also to Transport for London's ad people. The poster for the De Niro-Pacino film Righteous Kill (strapline: \"It's okay to shoot people, as long as you shoot the right people\") looks just fine in Stockwell tube station, particularly with the inquest into the De Menezes shooting - itself an MI5-Scotland Yard production - now under way nearby. It has impact; relevance. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>And is there anything to say but well done to Clarity Credit Management, shortlisted as it is, with so many others, in the Debt Collection Agency of the Year awards 2008. Where would we be without you? Where would you be without a stuttering economy?</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>But all this begs the question, how should we celebrate in this age of austerity? Too little merriment will depress morale; too much seems ostentatious. At the launch of a new Harvey Nicks in Bristol they promise venison burgers, fish and chips, hot dogs and cupcakes, but there is nothing in the invite about the traditional Bolly. Yes, these are difficult times, but if this is the challenge to be faced, so be it.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:diary@theguardian.com\">diary@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Journalists usually refer to what they write as stories. Not articles or reports, occasionally pieces, but stories. This does not apply only to reporters but to everybody in the editorial chain, from desk editors, copy editors, specialist and sports writers to the editor him or herself. Words published in newspapers, on air or online are stories. </p> <p>Stories sound interesting; reports sound dull. To some, stories mean fiction: \"Tell me a story, mummy\". Stories are tall and short, made up and true. True stories are about what happened. We tell stories in conversation, recounting experiences and events in which we took part or observed. The crucial thing about a story is that other people want to hear it, because it is interesting or entertaining. Otherwise the storyteller is a bore. </p> <p>So journalists write stories for their readers to tell them what is going on, to inform them, engage them, entertain them, shock them, amuse them, disturb them, uplift them. The subject matter will vary according to the nature of the publication and the intended audience. The good newspaper editor will have a clear idea of the sort of people who are reading it, and cater to their interests and preoccupations, sometimes their prejudices. And the paper will include that vital ingredient serendipity - the story you didn't expect, the \"just fancy that\", the absurdities as well as the travails of the human condition. </p> <p>Journalism is basically a simple game. It is about finding things out and telling other people about them. The finding out requires a variety of skills because those in power often prefer that we know only so much. Journalism is about holding such people to account, exposing their humbug and hypocrisy, the abuse of their power. This includes the control it gives them over the flow of information, the ability to bury the bad news, to spin and obfuscate. Good journalists must ask the awkward questions and question the answers, must dig to unearth and then explain, making comprehensible that which authority, by intent or verbal inadequacy, has left confused, incomplete or plain mendacious. Incomprehensible journalism is quite simply bad journalism, and therefore pointless. </p> <p>Ultimately there is only one purpose: to make the reader read the story. If they don't, what was the point of finding it out and telling it? This booklet picks up the story when the reader has reached the stage of deciding to address the story. That is not the same as reading it, or even reading a certain amount of it. They have just reached the first word, perhaps attracted by the picture, the extracted quote, or any of the other presentational devices used to drag the reader to the story. We have reached the stage where the reader is going to subject the story to the final test, reading some or all of it. This is about writing. </p> <p>Newspaper reading is different from reading a book. It is selective, does not involve commitment to the whole. Relatively little time is spent reading a daily newspaper. The newspaper reader, unlike the reader of the more literary novel, does not expect to invest effort in the endeavour. He or she will not read a sentence or paragraph a second time to be clear about what is being said. Confusion, more often than not, will mean abandoning the story altogether and moving on. Many newspaper readers skim, sample or get a flavour of a story rather than reading it through. </p> <p>So journalistic writing is different from creative writing. Many young people think they would like to be journalists because they have \"always loved writing\" or started writing poems when they were eight. It is certainly not enough and may well be a barrier to success in journalism. The late Nicholas Tomalin famously wrote that \"the only qualities essential for real success in journalism are rat-like cunning, a plausible manner, and a little literary ability.\" He included writing, but he placed it third and prefaced it with a diminutive. The writing matters; but don't think of it as art. Think of it as working writing, writing doing a job, writing that puts across information in a way that makes readers want to absorb it. </p> <p>At a time when the vast majority of entrants to journalism have degrees - welcome because journalism in a complex world is an intellectual pursuit - it is worth pointing out that writing for newspapers is also very different from the academic writing of student essays. No time to produce a route map for the essay and reach the point somewhere near the end; the journalist must grab the attention at once. </p> <p>It is difficult to write simply and engagingly, so that readers will keep reading; to explain so that all the readers understand, and want to. This is the task the writing journalist has.</p> <h2>About the tutor</h2> <p>Peter Cole is professor of journalism at the University of Sheffield.

  "<p>Lord Beaverbrook was the original Lord Gnome, so it's a bit of luck Jodie Kidd, his great-granddaughter, looks nothing like him. She makes a very good living as a fashion model. </p> <p>In <strong>Who Do You Think You Are?</strong> (BBC2), she traced her mother's line, the Hodges, and discovered that Rowland Hodge, her great-grandfather, was one of the hard-faced men who did well out of the first world war. The Hodges left Newcastle in a hurry after he and his wife were fined for hoarding a tonne of food in wartime. The newspaper report of the case, not altogether by chance, put a picture of Mr and Mrs Hodge leaving court beside another of some particularly well-fed pigs. With undiminished bounce, Mr Hodge bought himself a baronetcy from Lloyd George and became Sir Rowland. \"Crafty old bugger! So that's why we talk about Beaverbrook more,\" said Jodie. </p> <p>Well, up to a point, Lord Copper. In Canada she discovered that Beaverbrook's father-in-law had been embroiled in a Tragic Inferno Horror Slaying. Three Drury brothers lived together until John shot Edward, wounded Ward, set fire to the house and killed himself. As the newspaper report poetically put it: \"The morning sun of the sabbath rose on a painful little scene. Nothing remained to mark that spot but a few charred and smouldering ruins and old chimneys rising out of them like huge spectres of woe.\"</p> <p>Beaverbrook, as a newspaperman, would have appreciated both the pigs and the poetry.</p> <p>Rowley parish church in Yorkshire was a soothing conclusion to these unseemly dust-ups. Jodie Kidd's Puritan ancestors left here to settle in America and are demurely remembered in a stained-glass window. They are shown as the very image of simplicity. An absolute antidote to vanity. Seeing a model stained by the heavenly blue of this window is one of genealogy's oddest conjunctions. </p> <p>How Mr Hughes in <strong>The Family</strong> (Channel 4) must wish he were Mr Bennet in Pride and Prejudice. He could then leave the management of his wilful daughters to Mrs Hughes. Behind the solid door of his sanctum, the sounds of shrieks and passionate sobbing would be mercifully muffled and almost musical. The Hughes had three daughters before striking quiet with young Tom. Jess has moved out and is living in unsanctified bliss. Charlotte is bunking off school and in floods of tears. Emily is a whirling dervish who, last night, applied for a job selling shots in a nightclub. Shots of what was not specified. </p> <p>Finding a single man in possession of a good fortune to take them on will not be easy. Mr Hughes does all the cooking, from ambitious roast duck to homemade apple pie as, apparently, none of the women can cook. We'll let that burst on the husbands after the honeymoon. </p> <p><strong>Lost in Austen</strong> (ITV1), a time-travelling comedy, was bundled up into a suitcase last night with bits hanging out. Einstein could probably get the hang of it. Jane Bennet's marriage to Mr Collins was annulled and she decamped with Mr Bingley to the Americas, while Mr Darcy declared his love for Amanda despite her being a despoiled maid. \"Jane Austen,\" as Amanda, an interloper from the present day, said, \"would be spinning in her grave like a cat in a tumble drier.\" </p> <p>The best bit was Darcy and Amanda bursting into 21st-century Hammersmith, all seething shoppers, double deckers and pneumatic drills - \"this infernal place\" as Darcy put it. It was notable that his britches and her bonnet were utterly ignored. Only one man with a ponytail turned to take a second glance, not at Amanda but Darcy. </p> <p>Nye Bevan had a slight stammer which, if anything, seemed to intensify his speech like a river in spate flinging rocks aside. It seemed altogether appropriate that halfway through <strong>Greg Dyke On Aneurin Bevan</strong> (BBC4) my DVD stammered to a stop.</p> <p>I heard Bevan speak before the Labour landslide of 1945 and before Greg Dyke was born. He was supporting the young Barbara Castle, who sat behind him, her hair like a candle flame. His voice was high, sometimes rising to a squeak on a particularly passionate point. I cannot tell you now, and probably could not then have told then, what he said, but the effect was hypnotic. Lifted a foot or so from the floor, I floated home and in that elevated state voted precisely as he told me to. It's a dangerous power, great oratory. A friend told me that, on one occasion, \"Nye sicked the crowd on to the press\". The press ran.</p> <p>Perhaps it's as well there's not much around any more. The last of the demagogues, George Galloway, told Griff Rhys Jones this week how he prepared to address the US Senate. He got up very early and sat for four hours thinking how to do it and settled, being a former boxer, on a jab, jab, jab technique. It seemed, he said purring, to work. It did.</p>",
  "<p>Downing Street has drawn up plans to end the 300-year-old exclusion of Catholics from the throne. The requirement that the succession automatically pass to a male would also be reformed, making it possible for a first born daughter of Prince William to become his heir. </p> <p>The proposals also include limiting the powers of the privy council, in particular its role as arbiter in disputes between Scotland or Wales and the UK government.</p> <p>The plans were drafted by Chris Bryant, the MP who was charged by Gordon Brown with reviewing the constitution. They are with the prime minister's new adviser on the constitution, Wilf Stevenson.</p> <p>Sources said No 10 would like the legislation to be passed quickly in a fourth term and Bryant briefed constitutional pressure groups on the plans at a private seminar in Manchester this week.</p> <p>Ministers have long thought it anomalous that it is unlawful for a Catholic to be monarch but have not had the political will to risk reforming the law.</p> <p>The 1688 Bill of Rights , the Act of Settlement in 1701 and Act of Union in 1707 - reinforced by the provisions of the Coronation Oath Act 1688 - effectively excluded Catholics or their spouses from the succession and provided for the Protestant succession. </p> <p>Neither Catholics nor those who marry them nor those born to them out of wedlock may be in the line of succession.</p> <p>The law also requires the monarch on accession to make before parliament a declaration rejecting Catholicism. </p> <p>Though the Act of Settlement remains a cornerstone of the British constitution, critics have long argued about its relevance in the 21st century, saying it institutionalises religious discrimination and male primogeniture.</p> <p>Eight years ago, the Guardian launched a campaign for a change in the law, supporting a legal challenge on the grounds that the Act of Settlement clashed with the Human Rights Act.</p> <p>Geoffrey Robertson QC, the constitutional lawyer who has represented the paper in challenges to the constitutional restrictions, said last night: \"I welcome this as two small steps towards a more rational constitution.</p> <p>\"The Act of Settlement determined that the crown shall descend only on Protestant heads and that anyone 'who holds communion with the church of Rome or marries a Papist' - not to mention a Muslim, Hindu, Jew or Rastafarian - is excluded by force of law.</p> <p>\"This arcane and archaic legislation enshrined religious intolerance in the bedrock of the British constitution. In order to hold the office of head of state you must be white Anglo-German Protestant - a descendant of Princess Sophia of Hanover - down the male line on the feudal principle of primogeniture. This is in blatant contravention of the Sex Discrimination Act and the Human Rights Act.\"</p> <p>The next stage, he said, was for the government to challenge the notion of a head of state who achieved the position through inheritance. </p> <p>Dozens of people have been barred from taking their place in the order of succession by the Act of Settlement.</p> <p>In recent years the Earl of St Andrews and Prince Michael of Kent lost the right of succession through marriage to Catholics. Any children of these marriages remain in the succession provided that they are in communion with the Church of England. </p> <p>In 2008 it was announced that Peter Phillips - the son of the Queen's daughter, Princess Anne - would marry his partner, Autumn Kelly. It emerged that she had been baptised a Catholic. She was quickly accepted into the Church of England before the marriage and Peter Phillips kept his place in the line of succession.</p> <p>The Coronation Oath Act requires the monarch to \"maintaine the Laws of God the true profession of the Gospel and the Protestant reformed religion established by law [...] and [...] preserve unto the bishops and clergy of this realm and to the churches committed to their charge all such rights and privileges as by law do or shall appertain unto them or any of them\". </p> <p>Any change in legislation would, among other things, require the consent of member nations of the Commonwealth.</p> <p>Constitutional experts have argued that reform of the Act of Settlement and its related statutes would set in train an inevitable momentum towards disestablishment, and disestablishing the Church of England would automatically remove the rationale for the religious provisions binding succession to the crown.</p>",
  "<p>Before the English contralto became an endangered species, Marjorie Thomas - who has died aged 85 after a long illness - was one of those who gave the voice its postwar Indian summer. </p> <p>She established a considerable recorded legacy under the composer Sir Malcolm Sargent, including Elgar's The Dream of Gerontius (perhaps her finest memorial), two versions of Messiah, Mendelssohn's Elijah, Vaughan Williams's Serenade to Music and a number of Gilbert and Sullivan operas. She also performed in a famous Mahler Third Symphony with the Czech conductor Rafael Kubel\u00edk, as well as EMI's first stereo session, in 1955, for Bach's Cantata No 6 with the Bach Choir. Though hailing from the north-east, she was half-Welsh and half-Scots, and was proud to sing for the investiture of the Prince of Wales at Caernarfon in 1969. </p> <p>Born in Sunderland, Thomas moved at the age of two with her family to Oldham, Lancashire, where she began piano lessons with her mother. Continuing under the tutelage of William Walton's brother Noel, she won a scholarship to the Royal Manchester College of Music. From her second term, she also learned singing with Elsie Thurston, and by the time she graduated, it was apparent that her voice would be her fortune. However, she taught music for a year at Stockport high school for girls - Joan Bakewell was one of her pupils - while pursuing singing in her spare time. </p> <p>In 1945 she was heard by the conductor John Barbirolli, who booked her for Elgar's Sea Pictures with the Hall\u00e9 orchestra. That December she was Konchakovna in Sir Thomas Beecham's radio production of Borodin's Prince Igor. At her audition Beecham asked for more emotion, then added: \"But how could you have experienced emotion - 22 and living in Manchester?\" Still, he asked her back for his Delius festival in 1946 and his Messiah recording in 1947. While rehearsing at Maida Vale studios, she met her future husband Edwin \"Teddy\" Gower, the sound engineer for the broadcast. They married in 1947. </p> <p>Thomas first sang for Sargent in 1951, with both the Royal Choral Society and the Huddersfield Choral Society, and was among his favourite soloists from then on, often singing his orchestrated version of Brahms's Four Serious Songs. Music-lovers in the US, Europe and especially Britain will recall her chiefly as a concert singer, although she made forays into opera. </p> <p>In 1950 she took the role of the Dryade in Ariadne auf Naxos at Glyndebourne and the Edinburgh festival. In 1951 she sang Nancy in Albert Herring with Benjamin Britten's English Opera Group at the Cheltenham festival and, later, Britten chose her as Hermia for the early productions of A Midsummer Night's Dream at Aldeburgh, the Holland festival and Covent Garden. At Covent Garden she was a Rhinemaiden and a Valkyrie in Rudolf Kempe's Ring and Magdalena in Kubel\u00edk's Meistersinger. </p> <p>Though voluminous in neither voice nor person - she stood just 5ft 3ins - Thomas had an easy, unforced production that enabled her to ride orchestral climaxes in Elgar, Wagner and Strauss, while, at the other extreme, concentrating her tone for Handel or Bach. After Pope Paul VI's accession in 1963, she represented Britain in an international performance of the B minor Mass at the Vatican. </p> <p>Her natural vocal method was passed on to pupils at Manchester and then at the Royal Academy of Music in London, where she succeeded Astra Desmond in 1963 and became the first head of vocal studies, a position she maintained until 1990. After retirement she adjudicated at festivals and competitions. </p> <p>At home Thomas loved to have her family around her and enjoyed gardening, knitting, tapestry and lace-making. Her husband died in 1982, and she is survived by her daughter and son-in-law.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Marjorie Thomas, contralto, born June 5 1923; died September 12 2008</p>",
  "<p>Ask people what they associate with Finland, and they will say high rates of depresson, alcoholism and suicide, brought on by the long, gloomy winters. Although we Finns recognise some truth in this characterisation, we tend to laugh it off. But now, following Tuesday's massacre at a college in Kauhajoki, where 22-year-old trainee chef Matti Juhani Saari killed 10 students, the country is notorious for something more shocking: random gun violence.</p> <p>Despite a similar tragedy in November last year, in which 18-year-old Pekka-Eric Auvinen killed eight people when he opened fire at his high school in Jokela, no one expected this second murder spree. The levels of domestic violence and gun ownership are high, and the lack of daylight during winter causes widespread misery, but Finns still hold on to the belief that their country is essentially safe. And western Finland, where Saari went on his rampage, is one of the safest corners of the country, where people leave their houses and cars unlocked. </p> <p>Yesterday the Finnish prime minister, Matti Vanhanen, vowed to push for stricter gun laws, which are among the most relaxed in Europe. After the shootings in Jokela, the government began a reevaluation of the rules that allow 15-year-olds to acquire guns for target practice and hunting. Finland has the third highest amount of gun ownership in the world, after the US and Yemen - according to the 2007 national firearms register, there were more than 1.6m guns in circulation among a population of 5.3 million.</p> <p>But is the easy availability of guns the only problem, or is there a more deeply rooted emotional cause for these sudden, terrifying explosions of violence? I grew up an hour from Kauhajoki. This rural west of Finland is known for its entrepreneurial spirit: a large number of people are self-employed. The work ethic tells you to be strong and to mind your own business. Even though people in this region are considered slightly more open-minded and communicative than in other parts of the country, you could hardly describe us as talkative. The idea of customer service is about giving the right information, not about being friendly. The home country of Nokia is full of people chatting away on their mobile phones when in trains or restaurants. But when you meet someone face-to-face in Finland there is little verbal communication, even if you know the other person well. Finns are proud of their economy with words. </p> <p>In recent years, the education system has topped the international league in topics such as maths, science and reading. At school you learn to pay attention to your teacher, but hardly to use your verbal skills. Perfectionism is valued more highly than creativity and communication. It is hardly surprising, then, that Finland is still a monoculture where it is important to adapt. When I finished school and went to university in the UK, I discovered I had more in common with a Japanese student than other western European students. Although I was seen as an outgoing person in Finland, to me, my coursemates in the UK seemed overly chatty.</p> <p>Although Finland and Sweden are neighbours and their politics have taken a similar path in recent years, shifting from leftwing to centre-right governments, there is a big difference in communication styles. A 2006 study by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development found that Swedish children have more fun in school than Finnish pupils; while academic results were far better in Finland, Swedish children were better at expressing themselves. </p> <p>Nina Torkkola, a psychiatrist specialising in teenagers, believes most adolescents in Finland are fairly happy, but that those with severe problems are feeling worse than in previous years. \"One reason for the mental health problems of young Finns is that it is common for parents to leave their children on their own. Many parents perceive it a good thing for a child to be independent from a very young age. But this goes on as early as primary school level, when you still need your parents,\" she says. </p> <p>Torkkola does not believe that easy gun access is the problem. \"A bigger problem is the lack of psychiatrists at schools and colleges. Schools need to pay attention to those students who are quiet and lonely. At the moment this is seen as the norm so nobody looks after them,\" she says.</p> <p>Alpo Meril\u00e4inen, a Lutheran priest and counsellor based in Jakobstad, north of Kauhajoki, has a different explanation for the lack of communication in Finland. \"There was no professional help at hand after the wars [against Russia], so most Finnish men chose not to talk about their experiences in the wars. This became a male ideal that has made it difficult for men to talk about their feelings to this day,\" he says.</p> <p>He cites the Finnish saying that the weak will perish while real men keep going. According to Meril\u00e4inen, the alpha-male culture has created a situation where men tend to turn to violence rather than to verbal communication. \"During the war they used to say that you never leave a friend, while nowadays the Finnish mentality says that you never leave anything to a friend. This is individualism as I know it,\" he says.</p> <p>Now the region has finally got the world talking, and the shootings have linked Finland to the rest of the world. The terrible events of this week have proved that no country is as secluded as Finland likes to think it is.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 Reijo Ruokanen</strong> on teenage gun ownership in Finland <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/25/finland\">theguardian.com/commentisfree</a></p>",
  "<p>On Tuesday, Sarah Palin arrived in New York to begin two days of talks with a succession of world leaders. As she stood in front of the mirror on Monday evening, she must have wondered what an Alaskan hockey mom with a passport that has hardly a stamp upon it should wear to meet the Afghan president, Hamid Karzai. And for this most international of occasions, she picked a pair of earrings in the shape of her home state of Alaska. </p> <p>Forget about the rimless glasses; Palin tells us a lot about herself through her choice of jewellery. Her ear-wear displays a carefully crafted lack of sophistication. During a campaign rally in her home state, she decided upon beaded earrings that looked as if they had been picked up at a local craft fair. Accessorised with a glittery brooch that spelled out the word Alaska, the look couldn't have been more small-town America, more I'm one of you, I'm ordinary, I fight for my people.</p> <p>It's a universal wisdom that political women wear unobtrusive earrings. Michelle Obama, when addressing the 2008 Democratic national convention, chose elegant, understated diamond studs. When Hillary Clinton went campaigning, her lobes were usually graced with simple knots of gold, occasionally a pearl, never anything more ostentatious. In contrast, Palin, on her trip to Mississippi to speak about the impending hurricane Gustav, sported an oversized pair of gold hoops. Obama channelled Jackie O; Palin drew inspiration from Britney Spears.</p> <p>So what is Palin saying with her homage to Alaska? With terrifying literal-mindedness, these earrings express everything we need to know about her pride in her roots and her people. At least no one will be in any doubt about where she's from.</p>",
  "<p>The scare over Chinese dairy products reached Britain yesterday as Tesco announced it was removing milk sweets from its shelves as a precautionary measure. New Zealand authorities have warned the White Rabbit brand contains \"unacceptable\" levels of melamine.</p> <p>At least 12 countries, from Indonesia to Kenya to Colombia, have now banned Chinese dairy imports amid fears sparked by tainted milk powder which has killed four Chinese babies and made tens of thousands ill, including five in Hong Kong and Macau. Around 100 are still in serious condition.</p> <p>Several more countries have stepped up testing after melamine, which can cause kidney stones and even kidney failure, was found in products ranging from fresh milk to cakes and biscuits. The chemical, used in making plastics and fertilizer, boosts apparent protein levels in tests.</p> <p>So far all the cases of illness have been linked to infant formula from Sanlu, the company at the heart of the scandal. Products from other large dairy firms showed lower levels of the substance.</p> <p>A senior Chinese product safety official insisted that the problem was \"under control, more or less\" and Premier Wen Jiabao, speaking on a visit to New York, said the government would use the crisis as an opportunity to overhaul safety controls.</p> <p>\"There is no problem,\" Xiang Yuzhang, the quality watchdog's chief inspection official, told reporters in Beijing. \"There are no more problems in the market.\"</p> <p>Tesco yesterday said it had withdrawn White Rabbit Creamy Candies - sold in a small number of its stores - but had no evidence they were tainted.</p> <p>Hours later New Zealand's Food Safety Authority warned it had found unacceptable contamination in the imported sweets. \"This product contains sufficiently high levels of melamine which may cause health problems,\" deputy chief executive Sandra Daly said. She urged people to seek medical advice if they or their children had eaten the sweets, adding: \"This is a serious concern.\"</p> <p>Singapore's Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority had already reported the presence of melamine. </p> <p>Since the scandal emerged two weeks ago worldwide bans and checks have spread from dairy products to those which may contain milk.</p> <p>The European Union does not allow Chinese dairy imports but has already urged customs authorities to intensify checks on products such as bread and chocolate. A Chinese official apologised to consumers in Taiwan as authorities there ordered Chinese-made milk products and vegetable-based proteins off store shelves pending testing.</p> <p>Indonesia warned that retailers faced up to five years in jail and a \u00a3100,000 fine if they failed to remove from sale 28 products - including Oreo cookies and M&amp;Ms - until testing is completed.</p> <p>Kraft Foods said Oreo products did not contain any dairy produce from China, while Mars, maker of M&amp;Ms, said it did not use ingredients from China's blacklisted firms. Australia advised citizens overseas to avoid all Chinese-made milk products, unless companies had confirmed their goods were free from contamination, and the US Food and Drug Administration has expanded its sampling of Asian imports to dairy-based candies and desserts. Malaysia ordered safety inspections for many Chinese food imports, including those without milk.</p> <p>Anthony Hazzard, a World Health Organization adviser on food security, said: \"I think the greatest fear is if there has been illegal movement of the heavily contaminated products rather than the legal movement of products that may have very low levels of melamine.\"</p> <p>Four years ago premier Wen apologised after the cover-up over SARS, and the government promised to toughen safety regimes last year, after a spate of product scares.</p> <p>But Yang Fengchun, of Peking University's School of Government, told the Associated Press news agency: \"Although after SARS the government promised a more open media environment and to protect people's right of expression, without essential measures it's just empty talk. What is really needed is to change the system's framework.</p>",
  "<p>The US government has yielded to an outcry over multimillion-dollar Wall Street pay packets by agreeing to impose limits on the remuneration of senior bankers who benefit from a $700bn bail-out of financial institutions.</p> <p>The treasury secretary, Henry Paulson, bowed to pressure after two days of tough negotiations with congressional legislators who are reluctant to pass his programme to buy up banks' distressed assets without a crackdown on perceived boardroom excess.</p> <p>\"The American people are angry about executive compensation, and rightly so,\" Paulson told the House of Representatives financial services committee. \"We must find a way to address this in legislation without undermining the effectiveness of the programme.\"</p> <p>The concession, which is likely to fuel momentum for similar measures in Britain, came as the Bush administration battled to overcome scepticism about the biggest public intervention in the financial markets since the Great Depression. </p> <p>Polls suggested that the US public are unenthusiastic about the bail-out, and Wall Street stocks slipped on doubts over the likelihood of a deal. In an attempt to marshal support, the White House said President George Bush would make a televised address about the crisis.</p> <p>Measures to reduce pay packages are set to include severe restrictions on \"golden parachutes\" given to executives when they leave. Wall Street sources expect a clawback on bonuses if companies restate their financial performance, and laws to ban performance-related incentives which encourage inappropriate risk.</p> <p>Such changes are an about-turn for a laissez-faire administration which last year rejected congressional attempts to give shareholders a British-style \"say on pay\" vote. A crackdown poses a personal dilemma for Paulson, who earned $38m as head of Goldman Sachs in 2005.</p> <p>In heated exchanges on the issue, Democratic congressman Luis Guitterez told Paulson: \"We are asking American taxpayers to sacrifice, to put $700bn out there when other people are lining their pockets.\" Paulson replied: \"People in the country understand pay for performance for success - that's the American dream. But nobody understands pay for failure.\"</p> <p>Critics of Wall Street point out that the Lehman Brothers chief executive Dick Fuld received nearly $35m in pay last year. Merrill Lynch's former boss Stan O'Neal left with $161m in stock and options when he was ousted due to huge losses on subprime mortgages in October.</p> <p>A poll released by the Los Angeles Times and Bloomberg shows that 55% of Americans oppose government aid to failing financial firms. CNN found that 62% of Americans support government involvement in the markets, but 65% believe that a bail-out would be unfair to taxpayers.</p> <p>A sense of public anger at Wall Street's role in causing the meltdown was fuelled by news that the FBI was investigating the possibility of fraud at four firms caught up in the financial turmoil - AIG, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Lehman Brothers.</p> <p>Paulson is staying in Washington to continue defending the administration's plan and has turned down an invitation to meet Gordon Brown in New York today.</p> <p>The Bush administration delivered increasingly dire warnings of the consequences of inactivity. The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben Bernanke, said global markets were under \"extraordinary stress\" and action was \"urgently required\". The White House press secretary, Dana Perino, said there was a risk of \"financial calamity\" as \"the cold on Wall Street could affect Main Street\".</p> <p>As concern grew in the markets, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 29 points to 10,825. Morgan Stanley's shares slumped 11% as takeover talks with the commercial banking group Wachovia ended. Deutsche Bank analysts said the market was \"skittish\" on concerns that the US treasury might get less than$700bn, with the possibility of strings attached.</p> <p>Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup, said \"bail-out fatigue\" was setting in. \"A real sense of crisis has eluded many members [of Congress] who may not fully grasp the linkage between financial markets and their impact on the people who elect their representatives in government,\" he told clients in a letter.</p>",
  "<p>Martin O'Neill can no longer reflect on this competition with such fondness. Having won the League Cup twice during his time in charge at Leicester City, the Aston Villa manager has now suffered humbling exits in successive seasons. Unconvincing for periods and desperate in front of goal, Villa were knocked out by lower league opposition for the fourth time in five years last night after Damion Stewart headed the only goal to secure Queens Park Rangers a place in the last 16.</p> <p>It is a chastening result that will check the optimism in these parts after three away victories in seven days. The belief and confidence shown during that run was badly lacking here, however, as a weakened yet still experienced Villa side toiled against their Championship opponents. Boos reverberated at the final whistle although O'Neill, despite admitting that the result represented \"a wasted opportunity\", refused to draw parallels with defeat to Leicester this time last year.</p> <p>\"It's desperately disappointing,\" said the Villa manager. \"It's a competition we wanted to win and before they scored we should have been out of sight. We treated the competition with the respect it deserves and we got beaten but it wasn't because we fielded a weakened side. It was just because we couldn't put the ball in the back of the net. It's hugely disappointing but, unlike last year when I felt we didn't do enough against Leicester, tonight we created the chances.\"</p> <p>Although O'Neill made six changes from the side that defeated West Bromwich Albion on Sunday, the Villa manager claimed the starting XI, which included Ashley Young, Gareth Barry and John Carew, ought to have been strong enough. That was the theory but Villa lacked conviction, particularly in the final third where Marlon Harewood, afforded a rare start in place of Gabriel Agbonlahor, was guilty of profligacy.</p> <p>It was Barry, however, who squandered Villa's best opportunity of the evening when, with 15 minutes remaining, the midfielder, wearing the captain's armband for the first time this season, sliced wide with the goal at his mercy. Carlos Cu\u00e9llar will also want to forget the evening after he slipped prior to Stewart heading Daniel Parejo's cross emphatically past Brad Guzan from around six yards to give Iain Dowie's side an unexpected lead.</p> <p>Although Rangers rarely threatened - it was not until Parejo drilled a low shot from 20 yards, after the Jamaica international Stewart's goal, that Guzan had a serious save to make - the visitors grew in confidence after the interval and, Barry's chance apart, rarely looked like surrendering their lead. For Dowie, who masterminded victory over Manchester United at the same stage of the competition last year during his time in charge of Coventry, this was another moment to cherish.</p> <p>\"It was a powerful team Villa put out and I was very proud of the lads with how they played,\" said Dowie. \"With Ashley Young, who has such a great delivery, we knew we would have to be bang on with set-pieces. There was a big sheet in the dressing room saying that and we got it right. We were terrific [defending set-pieces] and that was a key factor.\"</p>",
  "<p>Irving Berlin has died at the age of 101. His almost 3,000 songs, 30 Broadway shows and 17 Hollywood musicals amounted to a unique testament to a talent for creating tunes and lyrics that millions of people in several generations could identify with.</p> <p>Jerome Kern, asked about Berlin's place in American music, replied \"Irving Berlin is American music\" and Cole Porter put him in one of his own songs in Anything Goes: \"You're the top, you're a Waldorf salad; You're the top, you're a Berlin ballad.\" </p> <p>\"I've not done badly,\" he decided towards the end of his life \"for a poor immigrant boy who can't read music.\" He did his composing on a one-key piano (F sharp) with a lever under the keyboard to manipulate a fuller range. Asked what effect a more sophisticated musical education would have had on his talent, Berlin replied \"Ruin it.\" </p> <p>Born in Siberia, his real name was Israel Baline. After trouble with local Cossacks his father Moses emigrated with other Russian Jews to America, taking his wife and eight children. Little Izzy was only four when they settled in New York's Lower East Side in three crowded rooms with no windows. He sang in a local synagogue with his father. His father died when he was eight, and at once he gave up school and went on the streets selling newspapers and singing the songs he picked up outside the bars and restaurants. </p> <p>His first really original song, Alexander's Ragtime Band, was hard to sell, then hit followed hit - Everybody's Doin' It, Ragtime Violin, and so on. In 1939, with the world on the brink of another war, he paid his tribute of schmaltz to his adopted country with God Bless America and refused to accept any royalties.</p> <p>He wrote White Christmas for a Bing Crosby film and it became the Yuletide runner-up to Silent Night. Not that composition came to him easily. Walter Scharf once said that seeing Berlin working on White Christmas was like watching a woman in labour. </p> <p>At 53, he decided to do another wartime musical, 25 years after his first one. He found soldiers this time were more grim and serious and cynical about blatant flag-waving. This Is The Army responded and became a hit both in the US and overseas. After the war, his biggest successes were the musicals Annie Get Your Gun, and Call Me Madam - his flow of tunes seemed as spontaneous in his sixties as in his twenties. He summed up his lifetime of songs this way: \"White Christmas made the most money but God Bless America is the closest to me emotionally.\"</p>",
  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-337967602\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>America's presidential election was thrown into disarray last night after John McCain said he wanted to suspend his campaign and delay tomorrow night's debate against Barack Obama to focus on the financial crisis. </p> <p>The Republican candidate made his stunning announcement at the end of a day spent on damage control, amid reports that a firm linked to his campaign manager was on the payroll of the mortgage giant whose collapse precipitated the meltdown on Wall Street.</p> <p>In an appearance from New York, McCain said it was time to put politics aside and return to Washington to help Congress reach a deal on President George Bush's proposal for a $700bn economic rescue package. </p> <p>\"It has become clear that no consensus has developed to support the administration's proposal,\" McCain said. \"I do not believe that the plan on the table will pass as it currently stands, and we are running out of time.\" He did not say he would suspend television advertisements, and did not rule out attendance at the debate.</p> <p>In response, Obama rejected McCain's argument that the Republican was trying to rise above politics. \"This is exactly the time when the American people need to hear from the person who in approximately 40 days will be responsible for dealing with this mess,\" the Democratic party candidate said. \"It is going to be part of the president's job to deal with more than one thing at once.\"</p> <p>The University of Mississippi, which is hosting the debate, said the encounter between McCain and Obama would go ahead as planned.</p> <p>Obama said he had been involved in talks to try to reach a consensus in the Senate while on the campaign trail. He said that McCain had mulled over the possibility of cancelling their debate in a conversation earlier yesterday.</p> <p>It is the third time in a month that McCain has shaken up the campaign, after choosing the outsider Sarah Palin as his running mate and cancelling the first day of his party's convention because of fears about Hurricane Gustav.</p> <p>The proposal to cancel the TV debates was immediately dismissed by Democrats as a play meant to divert attention from McCain's slide in the polls due to the deteriorating economy and the row over his campaign manager, Rick Davis.</p> <p>Republican senators claimed McCain's desire to return to Washington was evidence of his commitment to his \"country first\" election slogan. Other commentators described the move as an attempt to shift the public focus from the economy.</p> <p>The worsening economic outlook has led to a drop in support for McCain, with polls showing that voters consider Obama better equipped to lead America through the crisis. McCain was also buffeted yesterday by reports that a firm linked to Davis was on the payroll of a mortgage lender at the heart of the US credit crisis. </p> <p>The New York Times and Newsweek reported that the lending giant Freddie Mac had paid Davis's consultancy firm $15,000 a month from 2005 until last month - about the time Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae were taken over by the government and about two years after Davis took up his job as campaign manager.</p> <p>The continued arrangement contradicts claims from McCain as recently as Sunday that there was no connection between his manager's lobbying firm, Davis Manafort, and the mortgage companies. </p> <p>The McCain campaign accused the New York Times of extreme bias and of acting as an \"Obama advocacy organisation\". But the McCain camp did not deny the payments made to Davis Manafort. It said Davis had separated from the firm in 2006, and had not received a salary since.</p> <p>The revelations could accelerate an erosion in support for McCain as the public mood sours about the $700bn bailout of Wall Street firms. New poll yesterday gave Obama a lead over McCain after weeks of an apparent dead heat.</p> <p>The Washington Post-ABC news poll gave Obama 52% against 43% for McCain. Obama's lead over McCain was commanding on issues of the economy, with voters saying by 53% to 39% that they trusted the Democrat over the Republican. A Los Angeles Times-Bloomberg poll released later yesterday showed a narrower lead for Obama, who was on 49% against 45% for McCain.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337956125\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/maps_and_graphs/2008/09/24/US_poll_2509.gif\" alt=\"US poll\" width=\"231\" height=\"476\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Davis, who worked on McCain's failed 2000 run for the Republican leadership, began working directly for Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae that year as head of the companies' pressure group, Homeownership Alliance. The alliance was set up to oppose regulation of the mortgage industry.

His village of Jelepara in the far south-west of Bangladesh is desperately poor and has no electricity, and the young fisherman was walking back with food for his family at about 8.15 in the evening. </p> <p>It was June 20 - monsoon season. Tarak was walking along the high earth embankment that protects Jelepara from the river Chunkuri, and had just passed a small Hindu temple with its gaudy, painted wooden effigies of the tiger god Dakshin Ray. He would not have seen the real tiger that had just swum across the river from the great Sunderbans forest 400 yards away. It hauled itself out of the water and mauled him from behind. No one even heard Tarak cry out. </p> <p>But that was just the start of the drama in Jelepara that night. According to Selina, a young woman who lives only a few hundred yards from the scene of the killing, the beast then dropped down off the embankment, and silently entered Gita Rani's family compound in the village. It tried to take a chicken, but Gita came out when she heard the commotion in the hen house and was promptly killed. </p> <p>The tiger then went into the house where it killed her father-in-law, Aghoire Mandal. \"Word spread fast that a man-eater was in the village,\" said Selina. \"Everyone was very frightened and angry. People came from all around and the tiger ran to another house half a kilometre away. There it killed some goats.\" Many villagers kept their doors shut and prayed that night, as others kept watch. When dawn came, the damage was counted: three people, two goats, and several chickens had been killed and the tiger was still in the village. </p> <p>But rather than call the government forest department, 40 miles away, and hope that they would send a marksman to shoot the tiger, the people of Jelepara set about hunting it. It proved to be a brave but brutal exercise. </p> <p>Now it was the animal's turn to run. First dozens of men tried to corner it, blocking off its escape routes and chasing it away from the village. The tiger was tracked through long grass and rice fields. Finally it leapt on the roof of a house. Film shot on a mobile phone by a villager shows the tiger looking perfectly relaxed. </p> <p>As people gathered for the spectacle of what would surely be a kill - either of animal or of humans - several men then climbed a tree above the house with a rope. Slowly they lowered a noose above the tiger's head and secured the rope to the tree. At a given moment, the villagers then all started shouting and the tiger leapt forward in a desperate attempt to escape. But the noose tightened, and the rope, held by the tree, steadily began to strangle it. </p> <p>Men then came forward and clubbed the beast senseless, but it took the strength of many people to hang it up and finally execute it. \"Everyone was astonished how big it was,\" said Selina. \"It was at least 8ft long.\" </p> <p>If it was a human victory, it was one tinged with great sadness. This man-eater was a Bengal Royal, one of the largest of all tiger species, but this was hardly the magnificent beast of the forest seen on TV nature programmes; it was huge, but it was also old, thin and mangey, and had clearly come to the village half-starving. </p> <p>\"It was responsible for about half a dozen other deaths in recent months. It became a man-eater and every now and then it entered villages to look for prey,\" said Rajesh Chakma, from the forestry department, who arrived later with colleagues and took away the body. </p> <p>The tiger attack and the village's revenge on the animal was not unexpected. The Sunderbans' maze of swamp, islands and mangrove forests lying between India and Bangladesh is one of the very few places left in the world where man is not top of the food chain. It is possibly the most dangerous place on earth. </p> <p>Whereas tiger populations are plunging around the world to the point where there may be only about 6,000 left, in the Sunderbans it is believed that numbers are at least stable. At least 500 are known to live there and this almost inaccessible watery wilderness is now the greatest stronghold of tigers left in the world. </p> <p>But in the past few years man and tiger have been confronting each other more and more in the Sunderbans, and for once, it seems that tigers are getting the upper hand. \"More people are being killed in the forest and more tigers are coming out of the forest into human communities than ever,\" says Mamun Rashid, author of a study of 180 human-tiger confrontations in Bangladesh. </p> <p>The Jalepara tiger was the first trapped and killed by a Bangladeshi community in more than four years, but it followed a pattern, says Rashid. \"If a tiger is found in a village the word spreads quickly. Often the tiger is kept cornered somewhere for a long time while people from the village and places nearby come to see the spectacle. Eventually the people try to kill it by stabbing it with spears, knives, axes and or by throwing rocks. Cornered and injured, the tiger often lashes out at someone.\"</p> <p>Officially, there are about 40 human deaths a year from tigers in the Bangladeshi Sunderbans but this is a major underestimation, he says. \"There is a definite increase in people being killed. On the Bangladeshi side of the Sunderbans, at least 70 people are being killed a year now.\" </p> <p>It is the same story in the smaller, Indian portion of the Sunderbans where there is a national park and an established tiger protection zone. \"In Indian Sunderbans last year there were officially 16 deaths by tigers but the actual number of deaths is certainly much more,\" says Pradip Shukla, director of the Sunderbans biosphere reserve. In the past few months there have been seven deaths, he says. \"Many killings go unrecorded; often villagers don't report attacks in restricted forest areas for fear of being fined or having their fishing permits cancelled.\"</p> <p>While tigers may be killing more, humans are largely responsible for their own deaths, according to Rashid. Up to 5,000 people now to go into the forest regularly for food, he says. \"What i s happening is that human poverty is increasing greatly in the Sunderbans. This is because fish catches are declining, the rivers are silting up and, because of climate change, there is an increased frequency and intensity of cyclones.\"</p> <p>Climate change is a reality in the Sunderbans. Rising sea levels, constant erosion and increasingly salty waters make life in the tangle of islands and mangrove forests harder for animals. Bangladeshi scientists record sea levels in the bay of Bengal rising three millimetres a year, resulting in less fresh water, more floods and erosion. One of the largest islands is predicted to shrink by 15% by 2020. On top of that, new irrigation and hydropower projects have reduced the flow of the Ganges. The net result is less space and prey for the tiger. </p> <p>\"The only way that communities can survive is by going deeper into the forests to collect resources, like honey, fish, shrimps and crabs, and wood for their boats and homes,\" says Rashid. </p> <p>\"They are more vulnerable than they used to be. People now rely far more on the forest for subsistence.</p> <p>\"In the past, people could cross the river and go into the forest without too much danger; now the tiger is attacking people more,\" says Selina. \"In the last five years, 10 people from Jelepara have died in tiger attacks. There are many tiger widows here. Ten years ago perhaps one tiger would cross the river a year. The animal would take a cow or a goat and that would be that. Now we have two or three visits a year.\"</p> <p>Tigers are being forced to come out of the forest more because they have less prey than before, says Rashid. His research suggests that most of the victims were attacked from behind and that nearly 80% died. It also put to rest theories that tigers always eat their victims. In just 7% of the attacks did they fully consume humans. Usually, it seems, they took just a few bites, or, as in Jelepara, just killed and left them.</p> <p>Theories abound as to why Sunderbans tigers are more aggressive than elsewhere. Some wildlife experts say the water in this coastal area is more salty and this puts them in a state of constant discomfort. Others speculate that the only way a tiger can defend its territory in these tidal areas is to physically dominate everything that enters. Another possibility is that these animals have grown used to human flesh due to the weather. Cyclones kill many people each year and human bodies drift into the swampy waters, where tigers scavenge them.</p> <p>Equally possible is that tigers in the remote, largely inaccessible Sunderbans were never subject to the hunting massacres that took place in colonial times on the subcontinent, and so have never developed a fear of humans.</p> <p>Today, the villagers' fears are well-founded. \"One man in Jelepara was so afraid of being killed by a tiger that he moved to India to find work. But he was sent back and had to go to the forest to subsist. He was killed immediately,\" says another man in the village.</p> <p>The hostility between the world's two top predators has been based on equal amounts of fear and respect. Fishermen and honey collectors say prayers and perform rituals to the forest gods before setting out on expeditions. In some areas, people going into the forest wear masks looking like faces on the back of their heads, in the belief that tigers always attack from behind. This is said to have worked for a short time, but it seems that the tigers quickly realised it was a hoax, and the attacks continued. On the Indian side of the Sunderbans, people going into the forests wear stiff pads on their backs to prevent the tigers biting the spine, one of their favourite ways to attack.</p> <p>\"If you want to stop the tiger killing people and want to protect the tiger, then you must reduce poverty in the region,\" says Rashid. \"If you reduce poverty you can increase biodiversity. Development is the best conservation here. Otherwise, the tiger will come again and again to the villages and will kill more people. And people will not stop going to the forest, so the deaths will continue\".</p> <h2>Heading for extinction? <br>The animals under greatest threat from a warming world </h2> <p>Animals and plants have evolved very slowly to live in specific environments, but climate change is happening very fast and leaving them unable to adapt. Those suited to cooler climates must move polewards or uphill when the climate becomes just that little bit warmer. That's easy enough for birds and fish; species that would normally only be found in the Mediterranean or further south are now turning up in British waters as the plankton and insects they feed on move north. But for large animals, which often have restricted space in reserves, the future looks uncertain. </p> <p><strong>Polar bears</strong><br>The polar bear could disappear in the wild unless the pace of global warming slows. It uses sea ice as a floating platform to catch prey, but this is melting at a rate of 9% a decade. Last week, arctic ice fell to its second lowest level ever.</p> <p><strong>Tigers</strong><br>Tigers are threatened by climate change, and not just in the Indian and Bangladeshi Sunderbans, where sea level rises and increased salinity is reducing habitat. In Sarawak, Nepal and elsewhere, the already critically endangered animals are finding fewer animals to prey on, as monsoon patterns change, and as people near their reserves compete more with them for food.</p> <p><strong>Elephants</strong><br>In Africa, elephants face a range of threats including shrinking living space, which brings them more frequently into conflict with people. With less space, they are not able to escape any changes to their natural habitat caused by global warming, including more frequent dry periods. </p> <p><strong>Frogs</strong><br>Frogs and other species depending on freshwater are being hit by a droughts in Australia and elsewhere. Since they rely on water to breed, any reduction or change in rainfall can reduce frog reproduction. In addition, higher temperatures dry out their breeding pools. </p> <p><strong>Orangutans </strong><br>Their last remaining strongholds in the Indonesian rainforests are threatened by oil palm plantations, but also by climate change increasing the duration and frequency of droughts. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Friday September 26 2008.

  "<p>With its imposing red brick facade and quaint gold lettering above a grand entrance, the Midland hotel has stood out as a Manchester landmark for over a century. In the early hours of Wednesday morning an odd event took place in the pillared entrance hall, where the city's cotton traders used to meet, which may earn the hotel a modest place in more contemporary history.</p> <p>At 3.15am, as delegates celebrated the last night of the Labour conference, two government figures drew journalists into a circle to confirm a rumour that had been swirling around all night: Ruth Kelly would be resigning from the cabinet.</p> <p>In hushed tones, Damian McBride and Julie Crowley, special advisers respectively to the prime minister and the outgoing transport secretary, said that Kelly had asked the prime minister in May to set her free at the next reshuffle to spend more time with her young children.</p> <p>The briefing brought to a close a hectic night of activity which had been kicked off at 10.30pm when Newsnight reported that Kelly might be among a series of ministers to be moved in an imminent cabinet reshuffle. By 11.30pm the Guardian was able to confirm her departure as fact. No 10 sources initially played down the report, but within hours it was forced to confirm that Kelly would be going after the transport secretary had cleared a statement.</p> <p>As news of Kelly's resignation was reported on early morning radio and television bulletins, a war of words erupted between the various camps. The Blairite wing of the Labour party accused Downing Street of triggering another \"controlled explosion\" to flush out a potential rebel by leaking news of the Kelly resignation. </p> <p>Some allies of the prime minister hit back, saying that the \"toxic timing\" of the resignation was designed by Blairites to give the impression of \"dirty tricks\" by No 10. If so, it was not the first \"dirty trick\" involving Ruth Kelly on Tuesday. As journalists filed back into the press room after Gordon Brown's speech, several reporters were being rung by the Conservative press office and told that Toby Helm, the Observer's Whitehall editor, had heard Kelly saying the speech was \"awful\". The story was completely untrue. Helm had not even set eyes on Ruth Kelly, let alone overheard her. </p> <p>When he contacted the Tories and asked them what was going on he was told: \"Oh, we tried to ring you and check it out. Someone told us you heard it.\" It could have been these rumours that led a No 10 figure outside the prime minister's immediate circle to be a little indiscreet and speculate - with some degree of accuracy - about ministerial movements.</p> <p>It was this cock-up rather than conspiracy theory that was being advocated by some wise heads in Downing Street yesterday. \"This was absolutely not planned because our main aim was to ensure that the focus was on Gordon's speech,\" one figure said. The plan lay in ruins as the Kelly resignation overshadowed coverage of Brown's speech yesterday. Uneasy ministers said they now fear that the prime minister's position is becoming perilous. </p> <p>\"Gordon made the best speech I have heard him make,\" one minister said. \"But the overnight events mean that he is now back to square one. He will be toast by Christmas.\"</p> <p>The events at the Midland were set in train in May when Kelly went to see the prime minister to inform him that she would like to leave the cabinet at the next reshuffle. She wanted to devote more time to her four young children. </p> <p>In her conference speech yesterday, which was rewritten after the night's events, she said: \"I ask for your understanding when I say that I now owe it to my children and family to take a step back and start putting them first. If I do not, then I know that this is something I will come to regret deeply.\"</p> <p>But there were other reasons. As a strong Catholic, and member of the Opus Dei group, Kelly felt deeply uncomfortable about the human fertilisation and embryology bill, which she would be expected to support when it reaches its final Commons stage. Her parliamentary seat - Bolton West - is marginal and she may even decide not to stand at the next election. She was also understood to be dismayed with Brown's leadership and to have become angered at briefings that she was going to be sacked or would resign over the human fertilisation bill. </p> <p>Her departure marks a significant moment for Labour. Elected at the age of 28 in the 1997 landslide, she became the youngest woman cabinet minister when she was appointed education secretary aged 36 in 2004. </p> <p>Her allies remain highly suspicious of the circumstances surrounding the leak of her resignation plans. They have not finally decided which of the two explanations to believe - an innocent, unauthorised slip by a No 10 official or an operation to flush her out. </p> <p>Cabinet-level sources are uneasy too. Geoff Hoon, the chief whip, was irritated when he was asked about the reshuffle plans out of the blue on Newsnight. The programme accurately reported that he would like to replace Peter Mandelson as Britain's European commissioner. But this cannot happen until a new commission president - or the current occupant, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso - is given a new mandate next June. The cabinet-level source gave a taste of the breakdown in trust that is beginning to paralyse the government. \"We have given Gordon a lot of space this week to make his speech claiming to be the big man to fix the economy, but they are so small-minded and paranoid that they ruin their own day by briefing this stuff, forcing Hoon to eat a shit sandwich live on TV. It tells you everything you need to know about the way they operate. This all comes from Gordon.\"</p> <p>The Blairites believe there is a pattern. They are convinced Downing Street \"flushed out\" the former whip Siobhain McDonagh and the former Scotland Office minister David Cairns, who were both forced to resign after it emerged they had lost confidence in Brown. Friend of Cairns said that he had had to threaten Downing Street that he would expose them, when he heard reports they were planning to plant stories rubbishing him.</p> <p>One Brownite indicated suspicions were held equally on the other side. \"The reshuffle leak was deliberately timed to undermine Gordon. It appears to have been done in a way to look like No 10's fingerprints are all over it.\"</p> <p>The Conservatives can barely believe their luck. \"This all sounds like us in the 1990s,\" one said.</p> <h2>Night of drama</h2> <p><strong>September 23<br></strong><br>\u00b7 <strong>4pm</strong> Conservative official claims Ruth Kelly described Gordon Brown's conference speech as \"terrible\". The party says it has been told that Toby Helm, the Observer's Whitehall editor, heard Kelly saying the speech was \"awful\". The story was untrue. Helm had not even set eyes on Kelly, let alone overheard her. She later denies it herself, saying the reports are absolute rubbish.</p> <p>\u00b7 <strong>10.30pm</strong> Newsnight reports that Kelly is likely to resign as part of a cabinet reshuffle next Friday. The programme also reports that the chief whip, Geoff Hoon, may go to Brussels as a European commissioner - seconds before interviewing Hoon, who is caught flatfooted.</p> <p>\u00b7 <strong>11.30pm</strong> Guardian establishes Kelly is quitting.</p> <p><strong>September 24</strong></p> <p>\u00b7 <strong>1.15am</strong> Government sources confirm resignation plan.</p> <p>\u00b7 <strong>3.15am</strong> Damian McBride, Brown's press adviser, and Julie Crowley, Kelly's special adviser, tell journalists in the Midland hotel that Kelly is going.</p> <p>\u00b7 <strong>7.15am</strong> Brown confirms in an interview that Kelly is resigning to spend more time with her family.</p> <p>\u00b7 <strong>9.30am</strong> Kelly makes first public comments. \"This is purely a decision that has been taken for family reasons.\"</p>",

  "<p>The bloody legacy of the Baader Meinhof Gang which caused mayhem across West Germany with its politically-motivated assassinations, bombings and kidnappings is to be portrayed on cinema screens this week in a new film which claims to debunk the myth of 1970s terrorist chic.</p> <p>Just how raw the darkest chapter in Germany's postwar history remains has been demonstrated by the angry reaction that the Baader Meinhof Komplex has prompted from victims' families, the children of gang members and historians.</p> <p>Some have accused the film - which boasts a cast of top German actors - of being too violent, or of reinforcing the image of gang members as Bonnie and Clyde-style heroes.</p> <p>Bettina Roehl, the journalist daughter of the gang's co-leader, Ulrike Meinhof, wrote in a blog: \"The Baader Meinhof Komplex is the worst-case scenario - it would not be possible to top its hero worship.\"</p> <p>The Berliner Zeitung critic said the film had given Andreas Baader, the other gang leader and son of a history professor, the stuntman status he had always craved. \"Finally [he] has got what he always wanted. Posthumously he has become the hero of a real action film,\" the critic said.</p> <p>It was Baader's escape from prison for the fire bombing of two Frankfurt department stores that marked the birth of the Baader Meinhof Gang, otherwise known as the Red Army Faction (RAF). Its members' campaigning zeal was triggered by their anger at their parents' perceived failure to confront Germany's Nazi past. </p> <p>The Porsche-driving Baader modelled himself on the Hollywood actor Marlon Brando, and he and Meinhof, a successful journalist, epitomised the glamour that gave the gang its appeal - a status it enjoys in popular culture even today.</p> <p>The film, due for release in Britain and France in November, has been nominated as Germany's entry for the Oscar race. It is the latest attempt to re-examine a period of the country's 20th century history on the screen, following on from recent hits such as Good Bye Lenin, an account of communist East Germany, The Lives of Others and the 2004 film about Hitler's last days, Downfall, produced by Bernd Eichinger, who is also behind the Baader Meinhof Komplex.</p> <p>Based on a book by the former editor of Spiegel magazine Stefan Aust, who got to know many of the terrorists, the filmmakers say they have tried to make it as \"authentic as possible\", from the dialogue between gang members - which is partly based on correspondence between them - to the number of bullets fired in each attack. To counter criticism that the film lionises the charismatic gang members while ignoring their victims, the director, Udi Edel, said he positioned the cameras so they would tell the story from the eye level of the victims. \"I deliberately put the cameras next to the victims, so that we can see what they see ... to destroy the myth that has grown up around the RAF.\"</p> <p>But Michael Buback, the son of Germany's chief federal prosecutor Siegfried who was gunned down by the RAF in 1977, complained that victims' families were not told what events were to be depicted in the film. Buback had to go to see the film to find out that one of the scenes involved the murder of his father. It shows a terrorist posing as a nanny pulling a machine gun from a pram on a Cologne street before shooting the prosecutor and his bodyguards.</p> <p>\"It is cruel that little consideration has been shown towards the family members. We feel we're playing the victim all over again,\" Buback's son said. Eichinger was also criticised for failing to reveal new information he claimed to have been given about which of the terrorists was responsible for killing Buback.</p> <p>Jorg Schleyer, the son of the murdered industrialist Hanns Martin Schleyer, said it was \"painful\" to watch the re-enactment of his assassination, but praised the film's frankness in portraying the RAF as a \"wantonly brutal band of murderers ... without damaging the memory of the victims\".</p> <p>Frank Schirrmacher, editor of the Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper, said the film was \"heartbreaking\" in its authenticity. \"[It] has the potential to make people see the RAF in an entirely new light.\"</p> <p>But one critic, Jan Schulz-Ojala of Der Tagesspiegel, accused the film's Munich-based production firm of playing the role of a \"history waste management machine\". \"They're taking the radiation waste of the nation and burying it in the dumping ground of moving pictures,\" he wrote. In a similar vein, the company's next film, Anonymous, tells of the mass rape of German women by Russian soldiers after the capture of Berlin in 1945.</p> <h2>Backstory</h2> <p>The Red Army Faction (RAF) also known as the Baader Meinhof Gang after its two leaders, was originally inspired by the <strong>1960s student protests</strong> against the Vietnam war and other anti-US demonstrations. When the protesters became radicalised they sought to make their point with bomb attacks, assassinations and kidnappings across West Germany.</p> <p>Their <strong>34 victims</strong> included the leading industrialist Hanns Martin Schleyer, the Dresdner Bank head Jurgen Ponto and the federal prosecutor Siegfried Buback. Twenty six members of the RAF died during the campaign. </p> <p>Many were sentenced to <strong>long jail sentences</strong>. Baader and Meinhof were among those who <strong>committed suicide</strong> in Stuttgart's Stammheim prison in 1976. A second RAF generation then took up the fight. The group finally <strong>disbanded</strong> in 1998.</p> <p>In recent years the RAF has been celebrated by a wave of <strong>\"terrorist chic\"</strong>, spawning books, films and paraphernalia including \"Prada Meinhof\" T-shirts and bags with the group's Heckler and Koch machine gun logo.</p>",
  "<p>The green button was pressed on a nuclear revolution yesterday with a \u00a312.5bn takeover of British Energy, the UK's main atomic power company, by EDF of France.</p> <p>The deal, under which the mainly state-owned company committed itself to build four new power stations, was welcomed by Gordon Brown, who described it as \"crucial to the country's energy security\".</p> <p>However, it brought a wave of protest from anti-nuclear campaigners, rival power companies and consumer groups opposed to the deal on a mixture of environmental and competition grounds.</p> <p>EDF, one of the biggest names in the nuclear world, will control all British Energy's power stations, which currently produce around 18% of the country's electricity. EDF will construct two more reactors at Sizewell in Suffolk and two at Hinkley Point in Somerset - all pressurised water-style reactors similar to those EDF has built and operated in heavily nuclear-dependent France.</p> <p>The new stations, in addition to British Energy's eight nuclear plants, would be expected to begin producing electricity from 2017 onwards.</p> <p>EDF has promised to sell off unwanted land at other British Energy sites so that rival power companies can develop new reactors at Bradwell, Essex, and either Heysham, Lancashire, or Dungeness, Kent. It is also in talks to sell a 25% stake in the operation to Centrica, the parent group of British Gas. \"We are delighted that the British Energy board has unanimously accepted this offer,\" said the EDF chairman, Pierre Gadonneix. \"This paves the way for investment in the UK.\"</p> <p>The prime minister said the moves kick-started a drive to bring low-carbon energy to a country in need of energy security. \"New nuclear is becoming a reality. This deal is good value for the taxpayer and a significant step towards the construction of a new generation of nuclear stations to power the country,\" said Brown.</p> <p>Unions also welcomed the announcement and the prospect of jobs being created. Gary Smith, national officer of the GMB, which represents thousands of workers in the industry, said: \"At long last, one of the pieces is in place to secure an energy future for Britain. We look forward to having a constructive dialogue with EDF regarding the building of much-needed nuclear facilities on British Energy sites.\" </p> <p>However, there was opposition from environmentalists, who are largely opposed to nuclear power because of safety fears and its legacy of toxic waste.</p> <p>Nathan Argent, head of Greenpeace's nuclear campaign, said his organisation feared investment in renewables would now be squeezed out. \"Just yesterday Gordon Brown promised the UK a million green-collar jobs in the manufacturing sector, but his push for nuclear power has led to a deal which will benefit the French taxpayer and create French jobs.</p> <p>\"This country could become a world leader in renewable energy, which would bring a massive boost to the economy whilst tackling climate change and energy security. But EDF is determined to block this path because, as the company admits, growth in the renewables industry will kill off any hopes for more nuclear power.\" </p> <p>But Vincent de Rivaz, chief executive of EDF Energy in Britain, said the takeover would provide security of supply, take care of affordability and reduce carbon emissions.</p> <p>The company shrugged off rising delays and costs at a reactor being built in Finland, saying EDF could take advantage of experience learned from a new facility it was building in Normandy.</p> <p>The plan also came under fire for its potential impact on consumers and power prices. The merger with British Energy will raise EDF's share of the power-generating market from 6% to 25%, raising questions about its reach into British households. \"Our concerns are not about foreign ownership or the rights and wrongs of nuclear power, they are around putting more power into the hands of the big six energy groups,\" said Adam Scorer, campaigns director of energywatch. \"We think the current level of concentration has already led to prices being higher than necessary, and this situation has just got worse.\" </p> <p>The watchdog pointed out that Centrica - owner of British Gas - Scottish and Southern Energy are the only members of the big six which are quoted on the London stock market and therefore give detailed breakdowns of their financial arrangements. Npower and Powergen are owned by big continental utilities, RWE and E.ON, while Scottish Power is controlled by Iberdrola of Spain, leading to what energywatch said was a worrying lack of transparency.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Alex Lambie, the head of Welsh Power, has written to Malcolm Wickes, the energy minister, calling for the deal to be delayed until the completion of an investigation into the energy sector by the Competition Commission.</p>",
  "<p>Jean Charles de Menezes told his family they should pray not to be in the \"wrong place at the wrong time\" hours before he was shot dead by police who mistook him for a suicide bomber.</p> <p>The inquest into the death of the 27-year-old Brazilian, who was killed in July 2005, heard that De Menezes and his cousins had been scared by that summer's terrorist attacks on London.</p> <p>His cousins told yesterday how the man mistakenly shot dead by armed officers had praised the British police for their restraint and for not carrying weapons.</p> <p>Hours before he was killed, De Menezes had tried to calm one cousin's fears about terrorism, saying: \"We need to pray and hope not to be at the wrong place at the wrong time.\"</p> <p>The innocent electrician was held down and shot seven times in the head at point blank range by officers on an underground train on July 22 2005.</p> <p>They mistook him for a terrorist suspect who had tried to attack London the previous day, July 21, leaving the capital on edge following the July 7 bombing, which killed 52 people and injured 900.</p> <p>The jury yesterday heard from De Menezes's cousin who lived with him in south London, Vivian Figueiredo. In a statement she told of the last time she spoke to her cousin, on the afternoon of four attempted bomb attacks on three tube trains and a bus. Figueiredo said: \"Jean telephoned me at about 1.30 ... he phoned to check that I was OK. We were all feeling a little bit shaky after the 7th July bombings. </p> <p>\"After the second lot of attempted bombings on 21st July I felt quite scared. It was feeling as though London was beginning to become a dangerous place to live and I was wondering whether we should leave. Jean said we need to pray and hope not to be at the wrong place at the wrong time. That was in fact the last conversation I had with Jean.\"</p> <p>Figueiredo also said that De Menezes had been stopped and questioned by police at Brixton tube station about a month before his death. </p> <p>She said De Menezes had been carrying tools in a rucksack when he was \"licked\" by a sniffer dog. Police asked him some questions, then let him go.</p> <p>Another cousin, Patricia da Silva Armani, told how De Menezes had praised the police: \"I am sure Jean Charles had nothing to fear from the police on 22nd July and there was no reason at all why he would have behaved in a way that would have aroused suspicion. </p> <p>\"He had been stopped by the police a few times in England.</p> <p>\"In fact he used to praise the British police. He mentioned they were always polite and did a good job, particularly in comparison with the Brazilian police.</p> <p>\"He also remarked on how good it was that they didn't carry any weapons on them. I remember him also commenting about seeing other people being stopped by the police and getting angry. </p> <p>\"He was surprised that the police didn't react, because in Brazil people would have been locked up straight away.\"</p> <p>Armani told how the family became worried when De Menezes failed to return home and calls to his mobile phone went unanswered.</p> <p>When family members were asked to come to a police station, she said, she thought her cousin had done something bad.</p> <p>Armani told the jury: \"When police started speaking I could not understand a lot of what was being said. </p> <p>\"Then I made the connection with the news. My head started spinning and my stomach was turning. </p> <p>\"Later we had to go and see his body in the mortuary. The news had not really sunk in. </p> <p>\"When I saw his body I fainted. The following days were horrific. We were staying in a hotel in Kingston arranged by police. </p> <p>\"I had three completely sleepless nights with a large number of news people around and the shooting constantly on the news.\"</p> <p>The inquest saw footage of De Menezes's final journey, taken from CCTV from a bus he travelled on as he tried to get to work. Unbeknown to him, he was being followed by undercover police officers.</p> <p>The inquest also heard yesterday from John McDowall, who was leading the hunt for the July 21 attackers. </p> <p>McDowall, now a deputy assistant commissioner at Scotland Yard, said on the evening of July 21 senior counter-terrorism investigators believed the attack was linked to the July 7 bombings, with similarities between the devices used.</p> <p>McDowall, who the jury heard has a serious illness, gave evidence from a wheelchair and by videolink. </p> <p>He said police feared further attacks, especially with four bombers on the loose. </p> <p>McDowall continues his evidence today.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Thursday September 25 2008.

  "<p>The great growth area in journalism, and a product of fatter newspapers. Columns, like features, come in many forms. They are defined by ownership; the column \"belongs\" to its author who has that ultimate journalistic luxury, a slot, guaranteed space over which he or she presides and has, in some cases, near total control over content. The assumption is that readers seek out the writer first rather than the subject matter, because they are interested in that writer's opinion, whether or not they agree with it. The so-called \"me\" columns, often dealing with no more than the everyday trivia and experiences of the writer are remarkably popular, providing a printed version of soap. It is a form of writing that seems to have translated effortlessly to the blog.</p> <p>Writing a column requires clarity of thought, the ability to communicate a message clearly and simply, and an engaging style. First comes the decision about the topic, which must lend itself to comment, ridicule, satire or whatever the nature of the column. It may be inspired by a particular quote from a public figure, a story in the news, a report, an unusual occurrence, a piece of bureaucratic absurdity, a domestic incident or a sporting controversy. The column must be planned so that the writer knows before he or she starts just what they are going to say. There must not be too many ideas (two or three will usually suffice), but plenty of opinions; the bland, obvious or fence-sitting must be ruthlessly expunged. Columns are there to get a reaction - agreement, disagreement, amusement, enlightenment. Intolerance is often a virtue. 'So what?' will not do. The column must sustain its theme, building towards a climax or \"pay-off\" line. If it wanders the reader will wander off. </p> <p>The good column will have a clear identity, so that the readers will feel they know the writer, his or her prejudices, enthusiasms and obsessions. The best columns inform the opinions of the readers; the best \"me\" columns are retold by their readers as though they are gossiping about friends.</p> <h2>Michael White on how to write a blog</h2> <p>Someone once said that the trick of doing radio is that it is a conversation between just two people, you and the listener you can't see. </p> <p>It's the same with blogging. It's more like radio than it is like a newspaper column. The journalist's style must adapt to the different medium it is: more intimate, more informally conversational, more interactive. The writer can ask rhetorical questions - \"Prince Charles is a plonker, isn't he?\" - knowing that a dozen Royalists may leap to his defence.</p> <p>Actually no, not in the Guardian. \"Thread bores\", as I sometimes hear them called, tend to lack deference; good for them. They may be right wing, though libertarian individualists is how I think of them in my kinder moments, but they are happy to kick anyone who ventures an ill-considered opinion or puts up facts which are wrong.</p> <p>In the heyday of \"dead tree\" journalism (all that newsprint) error meant a postcard in green ink. Now it's a post to Comment is Free - sarcastic, abusive, mocking. </p> <p>So a blogger must be careful with facts, even bad spelling can shatter the illusion of authority. He/she must be prepared to defend every fact and opinion - or apologise. Brevity is best, it always is. Beware the conceit (into which I fall) that the infinity of the blogosphere gives you the right to prattle on.</p> <p>Above all, a blogger must have a thick skin. It's tough out there, but also fun. Among the hooligans there are clever, decent people who simply want to tell you things you didn't know.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Michael White writes the Guardian's Politics blog</p>",
  "<p>Most of the news writing advice applies equally to features, although the intro and structure will be different. Feature is a broad term. Some news stories, even major front page stories, are written in the manner of a feature. This is usually called the narrative style. It is still story telling, but it is closer to the personal form of telling a child a story, building to a climax rather that giving it all away in the intro. </p> <p>It represents the slow burn rather than putting the main point of interest in the intro. It is higher risk, because the golden rule of gaining and keeping the reader's attention paragraph by paragraph must still apply. The parody of the narrative story makes the point: \"It was just another day for Sarah. Little did she know as she left the house that by the time she returned for tea her life would have changed for ever.\" Now read on; but few would. </p> <p>The structure and the writing must demand that the reader wants to know what happened next, turning the narrative story into the newspaper equivalent of a page-turner. Extraneous or tedious information will make the reader lose interest and give up before finding out what the story is all about. The narrative works if there is narrative drive, and this demands more of the writer. The style can provide more atmosphere, more emotion, more colour. It can paint a picture and take the reader to the scene of events. It is emphatically not a chronological news story with more adjectives and more superfluous information that bores the reader and adds nothing to the story.</p> <p>Features can be news backgrounders, fulfilling the explanatory role when there is not room for that in the main news story. Increasingly, newspapers run packages, where news and background features - explanation, implications, case studies - are placed together in the newspaper. Features can also be away from the news: talking points, social trends, fads, fashions, arts and entertainment. They can explain issues and add the human dimension to stories about statistics and medical conditions. They cover all the specialist areas, such as sport, education, environment, music, technology and travel. Features are not necessarily constrained by the journalistic obsessions with newness or exclusivity. They can deal with what is simply interesting, remarkable or amusing.</p> <p>Features must be planned. Structure is paramount, the organisation of material gathered, from facts to quotes, description to context. The danger is for features to ramble or digress and then peter out. Whereas news stories are designed to be cut from the bottom (built in obsolescence at the end of the piece), the feature must have an end, a climax or a pay-off. </p> <p>They will often have a prescribed length, which is both a luxury for the writer, and a challenge. No excuses if it doesn't flow. Nobody else to blame if vital facts are missing. The feature form allows for more expression by the writer because it is less formulaic than the traditional news story, but with that come pitfalls. </p> <p>Features are the value-added part of the paper; you can keep up with the news without reading them. So they must maintain interest and be written in such a way that the reader keeps reading. That means changes of pace, lack of waffle, keeping to the point and ensuring that there is a narrative drive from beginning to end.</p> <h2>Lynn Barber on interviewing celebrities</h2> <p>The main problem with interviewing celebrities today is that you are given so little time - one hour is considered generous. So any minute when the subject is not talking is a minute wasted. Questions should be short, clear, and specific rather than general. \"What book did you last read?\" is better than \"Do you like reading?\" because almost everyone will say they like reading, whereas if the last book they read was Heat magazine, you get a sharper idea of their reading habits. Never waste time asking for information that you could have found on Wikipedia. And do take a long list of questions, even if you don't stick it - you are bound to need it occasionally as a prompt.</p> <p>Always use a tape recorder, even if you also want to take notes, as libel insurance. That way, if the subject subsequently claims \"I didn't say that\", you have proof. And also, with a tape recording, you can reproduce their exact way of talking, not just the gist. </p> <p>Be polite, pleasant, punctual. Always look interested, never shocked or disapproving. Let the reader do the disapproving - your job is to elicit the quotes.</p> <p>There are various ways of presenting interviews but the one I prefer is the first person account that aims to answer the question, \"What was it like to meet so and so?\" This format does not pretend to any kind of omniscience, and for that reason I think it is the most honest.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Lynn Barber is an award-winning interviewer for the Observer</p> <h2>Peter Bradshaw on how to write a review</h2> <p>In writing a review, your watchwords should be: simplicity, clarity and lightness of touch. You should always bear in mind a reader who, though, broadly acquainted with the sort of thing you are writing about, cannot be assumed to know all that much. He or she must be brought up to speed as quickly and fairly as possible about the matter at hand. Then you can start weighing in with all your subjective and provocative value judgments. </p> <p>With film reviews, it is important to give some idea of the plot, but not to give too much away. Do this, and you are guilty of spoilerism. I have been an offender myself. One of the most difficult things is striking a balance between conveying the big picture about a film, and zooming in on the telling detail. You have to give what's happening on the screen your undivided attention and cultivate the art of remembering it. This means writing your review within a few hours of seeing the film.</p> <p>Cliches? A wise editor of mine threatened to fine me \u00a320 every time I used the word \"darkly\", rising to \u00a350 if it was bolted to the word \"funny\" or \"comic\". By all means try to write funny reviews, though as Kingsley Amis said of novels: they don't have to be funny, but they can't afford to be unfunny. </p> <p>Digression, riffing, going wildly off the point - it's all fine, as long as it's entertaining, and judging this comes with experience. You can annoy or enrage the readers as much as you like. Just don't bore them.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Peter Bradshaw is the Guardian's film critic</p>",
  "<p>A gun that toppled the world into war, used in the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo on June 28 1914, will be unveiled today at the Imperial War Museum.</p> <p>The gun and a homemade grenade, on display for the first time in the UK, were part of the evidence gathered by police after they were used by a small group of Serbian nationalists who wanted to attract attention to their cause.</p> <p>The consequences of the bullets fired from the small black pistol by a sickly teenager would cost the lives not just of Franz Ferdinand and his wife but of millions of people across Europe, scar the lives of millions more, and sow the seeds of the second world war. </p> <p>The exhibition, marking the 90th anniversary of the Armistice, ends with the ominous words of the French Marshal Foch after the Treaty of Versailles: \"This is not peace, it is an armistice for 20 years.\"</p> <p>\"If there is a moral in our story, it is that a relatively minor event within weeks brought about the first truly total war, the first war in history genuinely to overwhelm the world,\" curator Terry Charman said yesterday. </p> <p>As the exhibition was being completed he showed the US defence secretary, Robert Gates, around on a private visit. Struck by the conviction of the British soldiers - and some of their leaders - that they would be \"home before Christmas\", Gates said: \"We said the same about Iraq.\"</p> <p>The exhibition - which includes a letter on the brink of war from the prime minister, Herbert Asquith - focuses on the lives of 90 individuals, including Winston Churchill and Lloyd George, and features the mess-tin and spoon of future American president Harry Truman and poignant personal possessions of ordinary people.</p> <p>The gun and bomb are a rare loan from the Heeresgeschichtliches Museum in Vienna. They were collected by police after the archduke was killed by Gavrilo Princip, an 18-year-old Bosnian Serb. </p> <p>One reason for mounting the exhibition now, Charman said, is that of the 5 million people who enlisted in the British forces in the war, just three remain alive: Bill Stone, Harry Patch, and Henry Allingham. </p> <p>\"Despite the enormous loss of life, and the promise never to forget the fallen, it is now completely overshadowed by the second world war,\" he said. \"We need to remind people.\"</p>",
  "<p>Preparing a wicket which, by offering the bowlers plenty of assistance, more or less guarantees a positive result is necessarily a risky business. The first danger, that it is sufficiently substandard to trigger a possible points deduction, Somerset have already avoided.</p> <p>\"It's a really good wicket, in fact it's a pleasure to see a Taunton wicket which isn't 80-20 in favour of the batsman,\" said Peter Walker, the ECB pitch inspector, of a track on which 14 wickets fell over the day. The second danger is that the opposition make better use of it and you lose.</p> <p>For all Justin Langer insisted he was thinking in terms of batting, the Somerset captain must have been disappointed to lose the toss. Had the stumps not been in place, it would have been hard to pick the track out from the rest of the square, and when Lancashire's seamers reduced Somerset to 72 for 5, the title looked to be heading to Trent Bridge by default. </p> <p>Marcus Trescothick, playing in front of a stand newly named in his honour, lasted only three balls before edging Oliver Newby to Stuart Law at second slip, Langer perished to a half-hearted drive at Glen Chapple, and when Ian Blackwell departed it looked unlikely that Somerset would reach three figures. </p> <p>What Lancashire failed to do quickly enough, however, was get rid of Peter Trego. The all-rounder was on 27 when he slashed at an Oliver Newby delivery and edged the ball high to first slip, but Paul Horton failed to hang on. In the following over, Chapple had impassioned appeals for a caught behind and then a leg before turned down, and the reprieved Trego went on to play superbly in reaching 81 before edging a drive off Gary Keedy. </p> <p>By then, with brave support from Steffan Jones and Andy Caddick, Trego had dragged the score past 200 before bowlers Caddick and Charl Willough made substantial inroads of their own. There was a third danger, though. Securing a solitary batting point means their maximum return is 18 points. If Notts, with three bowling points already in the bag, pick up four batting points and go on to draw against Hampshire, they will still have done enough. The cider remains on ice.</p>",
  "<p>South Africa yesterday broke ranks with Australia and New Zealand by insisting that next year's Super 14 and Tri-Nations series be played under the experimental law variations being trialled in northern hemisphere for the next nine months. South Africa do not want the inclusion of contentious laws which have led to a welter of free-kicks this year.</p> <p>The stance is likely to kill off hopes of all 23 variations being adopted full-time when the International Rugby Board votes on them next May. Only 13 are being trialled in Europe with Australia, in particular, furious that European unions vetoed the experimental rules adopted in the south this year which downgraded most offences from a penalty to a free-kick and which awarded a free-kick against a side that took the ball into a ruck or a maul and failed to bring it out.</p> <p>The global variations will be used in the November internationals in Europe, the Six Nations and on the Lions tour to South Africa next year. \"It is vital that we have one set of laws if we are to prepare properly for the series against the Lions,\" said the president of the South African Rugby Football Union, Oregan Hoskins. \"We have had five sets of the variations apply in South Africa this season; it has been confusing to the public and even to the referees. One set of laws for all matches is the only way to go.\"</p> <p>The Australian Rugby Union chief executive, John O'Neill, three months ago warned the European unions that they were in danger of creating a split in the game between north and south by refusing to trial the free-kick ELVs, even threatening that the three SANZAR unions would consider pulling out of the World Cup, but the decision by South Africa, who finished bottom of the Tri-Nations having won the World Cup under the old laws, has left him with a puncture to repair.</p> <p>O'Neill has claimed that southern hemisphere rugby can use the sanctions of their choice until August 1 next year, but the reality is that if Australia and New Zealand want the Super 14 and Tri-Nations to be played with non-global variations, they will need dispensation from the IRB and they are highly unlikely to receive it. \"I trust we will be able to reach a consensus with our (SANZAR) partners when we meet next month,\" said Hoskins. \"If that is not possible then we may have to go to arbitration on the matter.\"</p> <p>Three British players are among the nominees for the International Rugby Board player of the year award. The Wales captain Ryan Jones and his compatriot Shane Williams feature on a five-strong list, alongside Scotland's scrum-half Mike Blair.

  "<p>You've gathered the information, done the reporting. You've interviewed all the people involved, the eye witnesses to the explosion, the police, etc, etc. And now you have to write the story. You have pages in your notebook of facts, observations, quotes. You may have some agency copy, some material from other media. The first thing to do is stop and think. Do not start writing until you have a plan. Read through all your notes, marking the most important pieces of information and the quotes you want to use. The information you have gathered will not have entered your notebook in order of importance. You need to decide what is more important, what is less important, to establish a hierarchy of pieces of information. And this is where you must think about your audience. Not necessarily what interests you most, but what will interest them. It may not be the same thing, and this is where knowing, having a feeling for, understanding your audience is so important. As you stare at the blank screen try to imagine the reader.</p> <p>It depends on the publication you are writing for, of course. You can assume more knowledge if you are writing for a specialist publication, or a specialist section of a newspaper. A cricket report or commentary can assume knowledge of the rules of cricket; an article for a motoring magazine can assume the reader knows what a supercar is. But some specialist publications set out to educate - computer magazines are a good example - and while interest can be assumed, knowledge of how to use specific pieces of software cannot. So understand the intentions of the publication you write for, or if you are a freelance you seek to sell to. </p> <p>The market sector in which the newspaper is located is also relevant to how you write. You will find longer sentences and paragraphs and sometimes longer words in the more serious newspapers selling relatively small numbers of copies than in mass-selling newspapers with circulations 10 times as big. The reader of the Guardian will tend to be better educated and to have a larger vocabulary than the reader of the Sun. But do not, as a writer, show off your extensive vocabulary. It is never better, wherever you are writing, to prefer the less familiar word - \"wordy\" is always better than \"prolix\". Nobody is impressed by the use of a word they do not understand or would not use in everyday speech. The danger of talking down to the audience - assuming vocabulary as well as knowledge - is that it insults readers, makes them feel inadequate. And that turns them off and, worse, turns them away. They do not read on, and you have not communicated with them. The best writing for popular journalism is some of the best writing in journalism, and is hard to do. It is readily understandable, instantly readable and, if it is done well, makes you want to read on. Space is always the most precious commodity in a newspaper. Long words and sentences take up more space. Self-indulgent writing pleases nobody except perhaps the writer.</p> <p>Stephen King, who has sold more novels than most, reflected on his craft in On Writing, and drew a similar message: \"One of the really bad things you can do to your writing is to dress up the vocabulary, looking for long words because you're maybe a little bit ashamed of your short ones. This is like dressing up a household pet in evening clothes. The pet is embarrassed and the person who committed this act of premeditated cuteness should be even more embarrassed.\"</p> <p>So the overriding message in journalistic writing is: Keep It Simple. One of the greatest editors and journalists is Harold Evans, who has written one of the best books on journalistic writing, Essential English for Journalists, Editors and Writers. He summed it up thus: \"It is not enough to get the news. We must be able to put it across. Meaning must be unmistakable, and it must also be succinct. Readers have not the time and newspapers have not the space for elaborate reiteration. This imposes decisive requirements. In protecting the reader from incomprehension and boredom, the text editor has to insist on language which is specific, emphatic and concise. Every word must be understood by the ordinary reader, every sentence must be clear at one glance, and every story must say something about people. There must never be a doubt about its relevance to our daily life. There must be no abstractions.\"</p> <p>Below are a series of tips for keeping things simple and encouraging the reader to read it. They are addressed at news writing, but most apply to all forms of journalistic writing.</p> <p><strong>The intro </strong></p> <p>This is the start of the story, the opening paragraph. The traditional news introductory paragraph, still the dominant form, has two related purposes: to engage the reader instantly and to summarise what the story is all about. The structure is known as the \"inverted pyramid\" and dates back to the days of hot metal when words on their way on to paper passed through a stage of being slugs of lead. It was always easier and faster to cut a story from the bottom, using a pair of tweezers. News stories always have to be cut because reporters write them too long, and the (imperfect) theory was that a well structured story could always be cut from the bottom so that in extremis (do not use - see later) if the intro was the only paragraph left it still made sense. The good intro depends on your judgment and decisiveness. It declares why the story is being published, what is the newest, most interesting, most important, most significant, most attention-grabbing aspect of the story. It is not a summary of everything yet to come. The best intro will contain a maximum of two or three facts, maybe only one. In a popular tabloid it will consist of one sentence, probably no more than 25 words. The worst intro will be uncertain of what the story is all about and will contain several ideas. The best intro will demand that you read on. The worst will make it likely that you will move on.</p> <p>As Tony Harcup puts it in his Journalism, Principles and Practice: \"The intro is crucial because it sets the tone for what follows. A poorly written intro might confuse, mislead or simply bore the reader - a well-written intro will encourage the reader to stay with you on the strength of the information and angle you have started with.\"</p> <p><strong>Rest of the story</strong></p> <p>Once you've got the intro right, the second paragraph will be the most important you write. And so on. Holding the reader's interest does not stop until he or she has read to the end. You have already planned your structure, the hierarchy of information. After the intro you are amplifying the story, adding new, if subordinate, information, providing detail, explanation and quotes. And doing all this so that the story reads smoothly and seamlessly. News stories are about providing information, and there is nothing more frustrating for the reader than finishing a story with unanswered questions still hanging. Journalism students are taught about the five Ws: who, what, when, where and why. They are a useful tool to check you have covered all the bases, though not all will always apply. It is always difficult to detach yourself from your own prose when you read it through, but try. Try to put yourself in the place of the reader coming cold to the story, interested in it and asking the questions that will make it clear. Have you dealt with them? The subeditor, or text editor, will soon tell you if you haven't. There is always a problem over how much knowledge to assume, particularly with a running story of which today's is another episode. You cannot always start from the beginning for the benefit of reader recently arrived from Mars, but you can include sufficient to ensure it is not meaningless. It is a matter of judgement. </p> <p><strong>Active not passive</strong></p> <p>Always prefer the active tense in news writing, and particularly in intros. The active tense is faster and more immediate; it also uses fewer words. \"Arsenal were beaten by Manchester United last night ... \" is slower than \"Manchester United beat Arsenal ... \", and if it is a London newspaper \"Arsenal lost to Manchester United ... \" is still preferable. </p> <p><strong>Positive even if it is negative </strong></p> <p>Not: \"The government has decided not to introduce the planned tax increase on petrol and diesel this autumn.\" But: \"The government has abandoned plans to raise fuel taxes this autumn.\" News is more engaging if it describes something that is happening, rather than something that is not.</p> <p><strong>Quotes</strong></p> <p>Long quotes bring a story grinding to a halt, particularly if they are from politicians, particularly local politicians, bureaucrats or bores. Short, incisive, direct quotes change the pace of a story, add colour and character, illustrate bald facts, and introduce personal experience. Journalists paraphrase speeches and reports to focus on the main points, and to make them shorter and more comprehensible. It is a vital skill, as is using indirect quotation. But a quote will add a different tone of voice, inject emotion or passion, answer the question \"what was it like?\", \"how did you feel?\", \"what are you going to do next?\", \"what actually happened.\" Usually the reporter was not there and is gathering the information after the event. The direct quote provides actuality. And sometimes the quote has to be there to provide the precision, when the actual words used are crucial, and sometimes the story itself.</p> <p>Never use a word other than \"said\" when attributing a quote. Affirmed, opined, exclaimed, interjected, asserted, declared, are all tacky synonyms which do nothing to help the flow of the story. When people speak they \"say\". On rare occasions it might be relevant to the story if they shout or scream; in which case break the rule.</p> <p><strong>Officialese</strong></p> <p>Language used in letters from bank managers, council officers, utilities and read from their notebooks by police officers giving evidence in court should always be avoided. People do not \"proceed\"; they walk. Police do not \"apprehend\"; they stop or arrest or detain. \"At this point in time\" is now. </p> <p>George Orwell, in his essay Politics and the English Language, converts a passage from Ecclesiastes and turns it into officialese to make the point. Original: \"I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, not the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all.\" Orwell's rewrite: \"Objective consideration of contemporary phenomena compels the conclusion that success or failure in competitive activities exhibits no tendency to be commensurate with innate capacity, but that a considerable element of the unpredictable must invariably be taken into account.\"</p> <p><strong>Adjectives</strong></p> <p>Keith Waterhouse, the veteran Daily Mail and Daily Mirror columnist wrote an irresistible book on journalistic writing called Newspaper Style. It was in fact an adaptation of the Mirror style book he had been commissioned to write. In it he warns of the dangers of adjectives thus: \"Adjectives should not be allowed in newspapers unless they have something to say. An adjective should not raise questions in the reader's mind, it should answer them. Angry informs. Tall invites the question, how tall? The well-worn phrase: his expensive tastes ran to fast cars simply whets the appetite for examples of the expensive tastes and the makes and engine capacity of the fast cars.\"</p> <p>This test should be applied to all adjectives used in journalistic writing. If they add relevantly to the information being provided, they can stay. If not, strike them. Too many writers believe adjectives add colour and style. Vague or general ones add nothing. \"Use specific words (red and blue),\" says Waterhouse, \"not general ones (brightly coloured).\"</p> <p><strong>Jargon, abbreviations, acronyms and know-all foreign phrases</strong></p> <p>All of us who work in organisations, professions, specific industries or bureaucracies are surrounded by jargon. We may regard it as shorthand to speed communication because we share the understanding of what it means, but, whether intentional or not, it is a protective shield that excludes those not in the know. That is the effect it has when used in newspaper writing. Those in the know understand; the rest do not. Anything readers do not understand makes them feel left out rather than included and turns them against the story. They may well stop reading. Medical, scientific and economic terms are a case in point. Avoid them or explain them. Price/earnings ratios and capitalisation mean nothing to the general reader. It is the same with abbreviations and acronyms. Today's students have no idea what CBI stands for; they are more likely to know FoI. A few could expand Nato, fewer the TUC. Many of the terms, although still in use, are generational. They need to be spelt out or explained, or another reader is lost. Just as long words speak down to those with a smaller vocabulary - and there is always a simpler, and less space consuming, alternative - so well-used Latin expressions mean nothing to those who have not learned that language, apart from lawyers who have had to mug up. Pro bono, inter alia and in extremis have no place in newspapers, and usually mean the writer is showing off.</p> <p><strong>Puns and cliches</strong></p> <p>Headline writers love puns and phrases from 60s pop lyrics and editors frequently have to restrain their use. They sit even less easily in copy, where only readers over 55 can identify. Again, the danger is excluding readers. Worst of all is the extended metaphor or pun. Like this (real) one: \"Kingsbridge Silver Band has hit a high note with National Lottery chiefs to the tune of nearly \u00a352,000. Tired old instruments struck a chord with the lottery board, which has drummed up enough cash for a complete new set, giving the band plenty to trumpet about.\" Yes, really.</p> <p><strong>Apostrophes</strong></p> <p>The printed word has done more to save the apostrophe than the whole of the teaching profession. Given the pace of newspaper and magazine production it is extraordinary that so few errors in spelling or punctuation appear, a tribute to the subeditors who prepare copy for publication. From advertising (shockingly, sometimes intentionally) to the greengrocer's board we are bombarded with mis- (and missing) punctuation, yet it is invariably correct in print, though seldom when it emerges from the home printer. If in doubt, and most people are, consult Lynne Truss (Eats, Shoots and Leaves). Often.</p> <h2>Exercise: acronyms</h2> <p>What do the following acronyms stand for? If you don't know instantly, then you can be sure there will be plenty of readers who don't. So do not use them without explanation.</p> <p>Defra, Asbo, OECD, SEO; CBI; ISA; Fifa; PCT; Sats; FTSE</p> <p><strong>Answers:</strong></p> <p>Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs; Anti-Social Behaviour Order; Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development; Search Engine Optimisation; Confederation of British Industry; Individual Savings Account; F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association; Primary Care Trust; Standard Assessment Tests; Financial Times Stock Exchange (used to describe stock market indices such as FTSE 100).</p> <h2>Exercise: plain English</h2> <p>Rewrite the following two paragraphs in plain English suitable for publication in a newspaper or magazine. Remove unnecessary words, passive verbs, repetition, cliche, jargon and pompous or pretentious expression. Jot down some questions the story fails to answer.</p> <p>\"Joseph Foster and his sibling Kate were advancing cheerfully along Wesley Street when they were in minor collision with an HGV which unexpectedly mounted the pavement. It transpired later, when the multi-coloured Volvo truck driver who was transporting a container containing motor parts to Oxford was being interviewed by a local radio reporter, that the lorry veered to avoid a police car speeding towards him on the wrong side of the road. The spokesman at police headquarters told a different story. </p> <p>\"But it was the children's lucky day as they escaped shocked but unscathed. A hospital spokesman at nearby Eddington hospital, run by the Barton NHS Foundation Trust, said the two children were lucky not to have been seriously injured.

  "<p>The man accused of raping and murdering British teenager Scarlett Keeling was released on bail from an Indian jail yesterday. Samson D'Souza, 29, was arrested in February after the 15-year-old's partially clothed body was discovered on a beach in Goa on the west coast of India.</p> <p>He was accused of raping and killing the girl with an accomplice, Placido Carvalho, an alleged drug dealer who was said to have intoxicated her before the rape.</p> <p>On Monday, a court ruled there was no solid evidence linking D'Souza to the 15-year-old's death. He was asked to surrender his passport and cannot leave the state of Goa without court permission. The court released Carvalho in April.</p> <p>Vikram Varma, the lawyer representing Scarlett's family in Goa, said D'Souza had been released after India's Criminal Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which has taken over the case from the Goan police, had failed to register a charge sheet on the former barman within the stipulated 90-day period. An application from the CBI to cancel the bail will be heard in court on Friday.</p> <p>Despite the setback, Varma was confident the case would be resolved. \"We have full faith in the judiciary and the CBI, which is the nation's top investigative agency,\" he said. </p> <p>But vital evidence could have been lost because of a delay in transferring the case from the Goan police to the CBI, he said. \"A lot of evidence has been tampered with or destroyed which should have been collected or cordoned off immediately following the murder.\" The beach shack where Scarlett was last seen, for example, had been dismantled. Migrant workers at the beachside restaurant and bar, who could have been crucial witnesses, had also dispersed, he added. </p> <p>The case has been dogged by accusations of incompetence since Scarlett's murder. Officers initially said the teenager had accidentally drowned when her body was discovered on Anjuna beach. But her mother, Fiona MacKeown, accused Goan police of a cover-up to protect local tourism; a subsequent autopsy revealed the teenager had been raped and murdered after taking a cocktail of drugs including ecstasy, cocaine and LSD.</p> <p>The 15-year-old had been on a six-month holiday with her family. Her mother was criticised by Indian officials for leaving her daughter in the care of a local tour guide while the family visited another part of the region.</p> <p>A local organisation brought charges of negligence against MacKeown, who is wary of returning to India to give evidence in case she is detained, said Varma. He added that she had been refused permission to be represented by counsel to answer the charges: \"Mrs MacKeown is a single mother. Who will look after her children if she is detained? This is a mother who needs the support of the state and she is not currently getting that.\"</p> <p>Granting D'Souza bail on Monday, the court said the prosecution had not collected any evidence linking him to the teenager's death. \"Other than the accused last seen with Scarlett prior to her death, there is no other material bringing out his role in her rape or death,\" the court order said.</p> <p>A local organisation has been relentlessly pursuing a complaint against MacKeown, charging her with negligence for \"leaving her child in the company of a male person from outside the family\". </p> <p>Even though the high court has yet to give its ruling on the complaint, the Goa government's directorate of women and child development has issued a notice to MacKeown to appear in person to reply to the charges. </p> <p>\"The directorate insists [she] should appear in person, and not through her counsel, which goes against the basic tenets of the law,\" said Varma. \"Under the law, everyone has a right to be represented by a counsel. These actions send wrong signals to Fiona - that if she comes to Goa she may be detained here indefinitely on trumped-up charges. </p> <p>\"This is clearly an attempt by the Goa government to tell Fiona, 'if you come here, we will arrest you'. Unfortunately, a single mother cannot afford to fight the state.\" </p> <p>Varma said a voluntary witness, Mike Mannion, from Britain, had been prevented from leaving the country until the CBI took over the case and agreed to lift the notice issued to Indian immigration authorities to detain him. Mannion managed to leave India only on July 25.</p>",
  "<p>A blind Muslim student yesterday became the first person to be allowed to take a guide dog into a UK mosque.</p> <p>Mahomed-Abraar Khatri, 18, can now enter his place of worship in Leicester with canine companion Vargo after the Muslim Law (Sharia) Council UK issued a fatwa in response to his request.</p> <p>The Guide Dogs for the Blind Association described the decision as \"a massive step forward for other blind and partially-sighted Muslims\". Previously, all dogs were banned from mosques because the Islamic faith historically sees them as being for guarding and hunting only. However, the position was softened because guide dogs could be classed in the \"working dogs\" category. The animals are still barred from entering the prayer hall for the sake of hygiene but are allowed to guide their owners to the area where shoes are placed, the fatwa says. </p> <p>A special rest area has been set up in the entrance of the Bilal Jamia mosque for Vargo while Khatri is praying. Previously, the teenager, who attends the RNIB College in Loughborough, had to be accompanied to the mosque by a sighted helper. </p> <p>His father, Gafar Khatri, said: \"Since Mahomed-Abraar has had his guide dog, Vargo, he has regained his independence. Obviously it is early days but his confidence is growing daily.\" </p> <p>The Guide Dogs for the Blind Association hopes the fatwa will set a precedent, encouraging other blind and partially sighted Muslims to consider owning a guide dog. It is also hoped that mosque leaders in the UK and abroad will follow suit and allow guide dogs inside. </p> <p>After issuing the fatwa, Muhammad Shahid Raza, director of the Imams and Mosques Council UK and secretary of the Muslim Law (Sharia) Council UK, said: \"I hope that all existing mosques will follow Bilal mosque in serving the disabled people in a similar way by providing facilities to them. I also believe that, in all new mosques, such facilities for disabled people will be an essential part of their design.\"</p>",
  "<p>It is hard to overestimate the political importance in France of state-controlled nuclear power specialist Electricit\u00e9 de France, or EDF. Forged as an engine of national regeneration after the second world war, it was not until 2005 that just 15% of the enterprise was floated on the Paris stock exchange. The government retains a grip on the remaining 85%.</p> <p>Despite now being run as a stock market-listed company, EDF remains at the heart of French energy policy, which since the oil shocks of the 1970s has been dominated by concerns about national energy security. </p> <p>After decades of investment, 78% of French electricity now comes from nuclear power stations. EDF has become Europe's largest electricity generator, supplying 38.5 million customers across the continent, with plants capable of producing more than 128 gigawatts. Its 58 nuclear plants on 19 sites account for 72% of its electricity production.</p> <p>As other European countries opened their energy markets to competition, EDF expanded aggressively. In the UK, its subsidiary EDF Energy was formed after acquisitions including Seeboard, London Energy and SWEB Energy. It has more than 5 million customers.</p> <p>EDF was established in April 1946 when communist minister for industrial production Mar\u00e7el Paul - a former Resistance leader, tortured prisoner of war and Auschwitz survivor - nationalised vast swaths of the electricity production and distribution industry under a state-owned \"public undertaking\".</p> <p>Early years were characterised by a country awash with Marshall loans embarking on bold projects to build generators and a transmission network across France. These efforts were exemplified by the Tignes dam, the biggest hydroelectric generator in Europe when commissioned in 1952. EDF buses toured towns and villages encouraging households to wire up and be part of a France of the future. </p> <p>A wave of cheap and abundant oil imports in the 1960s kept the costs of electricity supply down, allowing demand to grow as more and more household and industrial appliances came with cords and plugs. The breakthrough for EDF was the arrival in 1971 of electric heating.</p> <p>But in 1973 France's era of easy energy came to an abrupt close as the Opec cartel of oil-producing nations began asserting its control over prices. With about half of its electricity generation from oil-fired power stations, France was hard hit. Thirty years of postwar good fortune - Les Trente Glorieuses, as economists labelled them - were over.</p> <p>Realising the importance of energy security, France's response was to focus on investment, through EDF, in nuclear generation while increasing tax on petrol and encouraging energy-intensive industries to shift from oil to other fuels. \"We don't have oil, but we have ideas,\" became the slogan of national energy independence. The government committed itself to build 13 nuclear power stations within two years.</p>",
  "<p>Pupils are to be offered free school meals in a pilot scheme that could be expanded nationwide if it is proved to make a marked difference to their health and concentration, ministers said yesterday.</p> <p>Alan Johnson, the health secretary, set out plans for the \u00a320m experiment to provide every child with free school meals in two local authorities. In a third area the proportion who qualify for a free meal would be expanded on a means-tested basis. About 14% of pupils get free school meals currently. </p> <p>If the two-year trial is proved to improve health, standards at school, pupils' behaviour and take-up of school meals, it could be expanded to every local authority. Estimates suggest it could cost up to \u00a31bn a year. </p> <p>About 18% of pupils aged two to 15 are classed as obese and a further 14% are overweight. Studies show that healthy meals improve pupils' behaviour in class.</p> <p>Jamie Oliver's school dinner campaign saw the government introduce minimum standards for school lunches under pressure from the TV chef. But Ofsted evaluations of that scheme showed that in many schools the changes turned pupils off school dinners. The new scheme, to be run jointly by the Department of Health, the Department for Children, Schools and Families, and local authorities, will look at whether free school dinners reduce obesity, change eating habits at home, improve pupils' concentration in schools, raise academic standards and boost health and wellbeing. Councils and NHS primary care trusts will be invited to bid to take part in the scheme and contribute a further \u00a320m in local funding.</p> <p>The initiative comes amid concern about rising food costs hitting the poorest families and worries that the current system of free school meals labels some children in a way that could make them vulnerable to bullying.</p> <p>The Department of Health said 43.6% of primary schoolchildren sit down for a cooked school meal. As a result more than half of pupils miss out on what, for some, could be the only healthy, hot meal of the day. The department said: \"Reasons for not taking a school lunch vary but, for many families, particularly low-income families, the reason is cost. The cost of one school meal is \u00a31.66.\"</p> <p>Hull city council, responsible for one of the most disadvantaged areas in the country, introduced free meals when it was under Labour control. The scheme was scrapped when the Liberal Democrats took over before it had been properly evaluated. Johnson said: \"Local initiatives such as that in Hull seem to show that children who eat a healthy lunch are more likely to be better behaved, better able to learn and more likely to see their general health improve. But we need solid evidence from a nationally assessed pilot.\"</p> <p>Ed Balls, the children's secretary, said: \"We want a healthy lunch at school not just for some, but for every child. And we want to make sure that children, particularly children from disadvantaged backgrounds who need it most, are getting a free hot meal every school day.\"</p> <p>In January Balls and Johnson launched a \u00a3372m healthy living strategy. Cooking was made a compulsory part of the national curriculum. A report on obesity last year indicated that nearly 60% of the population would be obese by 2050.</p> <p>Across England, 658,910 children at primary schools (15.9%) and 429,700 at secondaries (13.1%) qualify for free school meals on the grounds of a low family income. But about 230,000 of the eligible children do not take them up. Child poverty campaigners have said the reason is that many feel stigmatised.</p> <p>The shadow children's secretary, Michael Gove, said: \"Balls's promise on free school meals is just spin - he refuses to commit the money to pay for it and all he's really talking about is a pilot scheme.\"</p>",
  "<p>BAA has threatened the Competition Commission with a legal challenge after the Heathrow airport owner accused the watchdog of making \"substantive errors\" in recommending a break-up of the business.</p> <p>Manchester Airport Group, a suitor for BAA's Gatwick airport, meanwhile raised the pressure on the Spanish owned group by urging the commission to appoint an independent trustee to oversee any sale.</p> <p>BAA, Britain's largest airport owner, tore into a recent commission report that found competition problems at all seven of its airports. The watchdog has recommended it should sell three of its assets, with two to go in London and another in Scotland. BAA accused the commission of \"fundamental misunderstandings\" of its business in a 74-page riposte.</p> <p>Warning the commission that it had committed \"substantive errors of law\" and \"significant errors of fact and reasoning\", BAA told the regulator: \"If these flaws are not addressed BAA will consider the possibility of an appeal to the competition appeals tribunal.\"</p> <p>BAA put Gatwick airport up for sale last week as it conceded that it could not win over the commission and public opinion entirely. But its submission represents an escalation in its fight with the regulator. </p> <p>In seeking to undermine the entire basis of last month's provisional report, BAA is hoping to avoid any more forced divestments of its remaining six airports: Heathrow, Stansted and Southampton in England, and Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen in Scotland. However, the airport owner indicated that legal action is highly likely after accusing the commission of ignoring its concerns over a previous report.</p> <p>BAA said it objected to the three main struts of the commission's case for a break-up: that even without new runways its London airports could compete under separate owners; that competing owners would race to develop new runways rather than act like heel-dragging monopolists; and that there is ample room for immediate competition between Glasgow and Edinburgh airports if one of them is sold by BAA.</p> <p>On the first point, BAA said the commission had failed to prove that, without a joint owner, Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted would compete for passengers by offering better facilities and, possibly, more competitive landing charges. On the second part of the commission's case, BAA said the government's control over airport expansion precluded anyone from racing to build a new runway ahead of a competitor. On the Scottish airports, the group argued that there is strong evidence that air passengers in Glasgow and Edinburgh are not interested in flying from their rival city, regardless of issues of price or quality.</p> <p>The Competition Commission declined to comment last night, but BAA must overturn precedent if it is to win a tribunal. The two cases so far, brought by supermarket owner Somerfield and clinical waste companies, have found in the commission's favour. </p> <p>The tribunal, which is staffed by QCs and high court judges, has the power to make the Competition Commission reconsider its conclusions. Christopher Clarke, chairman of the commission's inquiry group, last month dismissed BAA's plea of impotence in the face of government policy: \"You would expect the owner and operator ... to want to push the government,\" he said.</p> <p>Manchester Airport Group, one of the early favourites to acquire Gatwick, is understood to have asked the commission to appoint a \"divestiture trustee\" who would oversee the disposal of assets, including Gatwick, to ensure a fair sale. MAG is concerned that BAA will sell the airport to a sovereign wealth fund or private equity firm rather than a rival in an attempt to protect its remaining businesses from competition. The commission, which is due to make its final decision on BAA by March next year, asked parties last month whether a disposal trustee should be appointed.</p> <p>BAA is expected to tell the commission that a trustee will put off potential bidders and send a negative signal to foreign investors, who might be concerned about the re-sale value of assets. </p> <p>A BAA spokesman said yesterday that the group expected an unhindered sale process: \"Ultimately, we expect the market will determine who buys the airport and we will not provide a running commentary on the views of individual bidders as they put forward their case.\" </p> <p>BAA added that it is giving the commission regular updates on the sale process.</p>",
  "<p>Rowan Williams broke with two long-standing Anglican taboos yesterday by becoming the first Archbishop of Canterbury officially to visit the French Catholic shrine at Lourdes and by offering at least limited support for Karl Marx's condemnation of unbridled capitalism.</p> <p>Either gesture in past times would have incurred the wrath of hardliners, but responses were muted.</p> <p>At Lourdes, where Williams is on a pilgrimage with other Anglicans, he spoke during a sermon of the example of St Bernadette, the peasant girl whose apparent visions of the Virgin Mary in a grotto near the Pyrenean town exactly 150 years ago made Lourdes a place of pilgrimage. Williams said the experience of coming to a place soaked in the hopes of millions could help believers to experience the \"deep and mysterious\" joy of God.</p> <p>\"Our prayer here must be that, renewed and surprised in this holy place, we may be given the overshadowing strength of the spirit to carry Jesus wherever we go, in the hope that joy will leap from heart to heart in all our Christian encounters,\" Williams said in his address, during a mass celebrated by his friend Cardinal Walter Kasper, president of the Vatican's Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity, who has been scathing about the state of the Anglican church in recent months. </p> <p>Williams, who comes from Anglicanism's Anglo-Catholic wing, was visiting the shrine a week after Pope Benedict XVI marked its anniversary. Although the archbishop has visited the best-known Anglican shrine in England, at Walsingham, Norfolk, Lourdes' status and character has often aroused Protestant suspicion.</p> <p>Some bloggers yesterday drew attention to the Tudor-era founding statutes of the Church of England, which warn against the invocation of saints as \"a fond thing, vainly invented and grounded upon no warranty of scripture but rather repugnant to the word of God\".</p> <p>The archbishop invoked idolatry when writing about the credit crisis in this week's Spectator magazine. The self-styled hairy leftie says: \"To grant that without a basis of some common prosperity and stability, no speculative market can long survive is not to argue for rigid Soviet-style centralised direction ... Without a background of social stability, everyone will eventually suffer, including the most resourceful, bold and ingenious of speculators.</p> <p>\"Marx long ago observed the way in which unbridled capitalism became a kind of mythology, ascribing reality, power and agency to things that had no life in themselves; he was right about that, if about little else. Ascribing independent reality to what you have in fact made yourself is a perfect definition of what the Jewish and Christian scriptures call idolatry.\"</p>",
  "<p>Can a platform have gatekeepers? That is, can you define as a platform something that has gatekeepers? I think not: if it's got people who stop stuff going in, you call it a \"walled garden\". In which case the iPhone, which had looked for, oh, at least a few weeks as though it would be a platform, is actually a walled garden. And that's not good for its long-term future, especially not now that Google has teamed up with T-Mobile to launch the first mobile based on Android, the open mobile phone platform.</p> <p>Of course, if you're inside Apple's garden and standing in just the right spot, things are pretty rosy. Since the iPhone App Store opened on July 11, at least one writer has collected a cool $250,000: Steve Demeter, writer of Prism, a game that relies on the iPhone/iPod Touch's accelerometer (<a href=\"http://www.bit.ly/charles5\">bit.ly/charles5</a>).</p> <p>That quarter of a million is only 70% of the revenues; Apple keeps the other 30%, or $107,000. That's good business (developers usually get a lot less than 70% of the sale price via traditional third-party distribution). And that's just one application among thousands of paid-for ones. </p> <p>Only if you can get inside, though. And the walls of the garden are strangely defined. Most egregious is the case of Podcaster (<a href=\"http://www.bit.ly/charles6\">bit.ly/charles6</a>), which downloads podcasts on to an iPhone via Wi-Fi; this was rejected for \"duplicating functionality of iTunes\". Two things: first, it doesn't; second, why should Apple care? It's not as if iTunes is going extinct. And is Apple seriously saying it's a problem that an app does something better than iTunes does? </p> <p>More recently another program called MailWrangler, which lets you check multiple Gmail accounts on the iPhone, has been rejected (<a href=\"http://www.bit.ly/charles7\">bit.ly/charles7</a>) because it \"duplicates the functionality of the built-in iPhone application Mail without providing sufficient differentiation or added functionality, which will lead to user confusion\". So your program can't be better than Apple's; and it can't be as good as Apple's. I think I'm starting to get the picture.</p> <p>But just to be sure, I asked Apple to clarify its rules on programs' eligibility. They said they'd have an answer next day. A week later, there's still silence. As Wil Shipley, writer of the Mac application Delicious Library, points out, Apple clearly has no problem with developers duplicating each others' functionality: there are loads of sudoku programs available. It's when they \"duplicate\" Apple functionality it gets all huffy.</p> <p>Shipley offers (at <a href=\"http://www.bit.ly/charles8\">bit.ly/charles8</a>) a simple rule: \"Publish all software submitted to Apple, as long as the software isn't actively harmful to users, [or] illegal, and does not violate Apple's agreements with cell phone vendors.\"</p> <p>Shipley is hardly delighted about Apple's rules on rejection, which it seems to have discovered down the back of a sofa in Cupertino during a latte break from approving 4,000 different iPhone apps that let you use it as a torch. He says it's \"unethical and antithetical to the whole idea of an App Store for Apple to be censoring applications based on criteria they have never given to developers, and only told developers after the developers put in all the work of writing an app\".</p> <p>Precisely. You can't have a half-open platform; it's like being half-pregnant. Openness to all comers constitutes the difference between a platform, like Android, and a walled garden, like the iPhone (and, to be fair, pretty much every other mobile phone). RIM doesn't have gatekeepers for the BlackBerry, and Microsoft doesn't with Windows Mobile. Once Android developers get their feet under the desk, there will be some very interesting applications, and they'll all fight to be noticed on a stage even more disorganised than the iPhone App Store: the world wide web.</p> <p>Google won't be setting up an Android App Store, and while T-Mobile might, I doubt it'll be as successful as Apple's, because one will be able to put pretty much anything from anywhere on to Android. All the cash will go to the developers, if they can capture it.</p> <p>But I know, I know: $250,000 in three months. I don't think that any application will make that much money for Android in the next three months, and perhaps not in the coming year.</p> <p>However, that's not the point of Android. It's much more about getting people to use the net all the time. Ultimately, the iPhone makes money for Google too, because it gets people using the net. Apple's not about to ban that. Which means Google will win - in time.</p>",
  "<p>Police believe the gunman who killed 10 people at a college in Finland may have been in contact with another student who carried out a similar massacre a year ago. </p> <p>Before the killings on Tuesday, trainee chef Matti Saari, 22, travelled 155 miles (249 km) to buy a gun in Jokela, where last November Pekka-Eric Auvinen, 18, shot dead eight people and himself.</p> <p>Both men used .22 handguns, and police believe they may have bought the weapons in the same shop. Jari Neulaniemi, the lead investigator, said: \"Their actions seems so similar that I would consider it a miracle if we did not find some connecting link.\" </p> <p>Detectives described similarities between the cases: both gunmen posted violent clips on YouTube before the shootings; both were fascinated by the 1999 Columbine massacre; both attacked their own colleges, and both died after shooting themselves in the head. An investigation has also begun to discover why police allowed Saari to keep his gun after interviewing him on Monday about death threats he made on YouTube.</p> <p>Yesterday Matti Vanhanen, the prime minister, said Finland would re-examine its gun laws in the wake of the shooting. \"We need to study if people should get access to handguns so freely,\" he told reporters. </p> <p>Finland has one of the highest levels of gun ownership in the world, with more than one in 10 of the population owning a firearms licence and 1.6m guns in a population of 5.3 million. Interior minister Anne Holmlund said yesterday the government would look at proposals to give police greater powers to investigate people who applied for licences.</p>",
  "<p>A year ago today soldiers of the 66th and 77th Light Infantry divisions entered Rangoon and started shooting at monks and civilians. It was the beginning of the end of the Saffron uprising. Dozens were killed and thousands imprisoned in the ensuing crackdown. The year did not improve for the long-suffering Burmese. On May 2, Cyclone Nargis struck, drowning the Irrawaddy Delta in a storm surge four metres high. About 130,000 people perished. A year into this cycle of feudal repression and natural disaster, the United Nations should rightly ask itself what international pressure has achieved.</p> <p>The balance sheet is mixed. Open political dissent has been crushed and, although there is no shortage of activists muttering about round two, it may not happen for some time. Similarly, the regime did just about enough to accept aid after the cyclone struck, but thwart the aid effort. They prevented the aid from being unloaded or dropped directly from US and French warships offshore. But the feared second wave of casualties, from famine and disease, never happened. This is partly because the devastated region had a fresh supply of water, and partly because the army did deliver the aid. Mostly, survival was down to the resilience of a people who had suffered worse. So the junta got away with it on both fronts. It did as little as it needed to ensure its own survival.</p> <p>But that is not the whole story. The price of rejecting help from the regime's mortal western foes was paid for by having to accept the involvement of the United Nations and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) of which Burma is a member. Asean wants to turn itself into an economic trading block, on EU lines, by 2015. But to negotiate favourable trading terms with other blocks like the EU, it will have to enforce the human rights agenda in its charter, which Burma was one of the first members to sign up to. This leads some to conclude that the clock is ticking for Asean on Burma.</p> <p>The question is whether the engagement of Asean can be broadened and widened. The next objective is to force the generals to make concessions to Aung San Suu Kyi and the National League for Democracy for the election of 2010, in which she is specifically barred. The junta's decision on Monday to release five political prisoners, including its longest serving one, Win Tin, showed a desire to influence the debate in the UN. The lesson of the last year is that international pressure must be kept up on Burma. As it is, the regime thrives. While the rest of the country starves, untold billions are spent on constructing a new capital, a giant folly in the tropics which includes a zoo with an air-conditioned enclosure for penguins.</p>",
  "<p>Imagine the scene: the United Nations general assembly meets to discuss a resolution to the Israel-Palestine conflict. Unlike previous resolutions, which have been based on a Jewish state in most of historic Palestine with Palestinians relegated to the remnants, this one calls for a new state, covering what is now Israel, the West Bank and Gaza, whose present and former inhabitants are equal under the law. Such a resolution has, in fact, already been drafted and discussions have begun to place it on the agenda at the UN. </p> <p>The one-state solution is now part of mainstream discourse. Increasingly, Palestinians - and some Israelis - support it as the only alternative to a Palestinian state subordinate to Israel. One-state groups have sprung up and conferences and studies are under way.</p> <p>A UN resolution is the logical next step, underlining the issue's global importance and exposing the inequity and dishonesty of the two-state solution, to replace it with something fairer and more durable. It would be encapsulated in the following clauses, part of the draft UN resolution for a one-state solution, which has been under discussion for six months. Its principal authors are my fellow Palestinian Karl Sabbagh and myself:</p> <p>\"The general assembly notes the failure of recent efforts made by regional and international parties to resolve the conflict through the creation of two states; Recalling the recent history of the former [Palestine] Mandate territory as a land where Arabs and Jews shared equal rights of habitation; Reviewing Israel's non-compliance with UN Resolution 194, requiring Israel to repatriate the Palestinian refugees, and its illegal conduct in the occupied territories.</p> <p>\"Calls upon representatives of Israel and Palestine to agree on behalf of their peoples to share the land between the Mediterranean and the river Jordan ... by setting up a state which is democratic and secular, in which the rights of all people living within its borders to freedom of worship, security, and equality under the law are enshrined in a new constitution, to replace the separate forms of government that apply currently in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza.\" </p> <p>The two-state adherents will not approve. David Miliband at the Labour party conference this week continued to argue for a two-state solution. Tomorrow in New York, Mahmoud Abbas will petition George Bush for the same thing. Both are on a hiding to nothing. </p> <p>The pace of Israeli colonisation, unimpeded since 1967, redoubled after the Oslo accords, demonstrating Israel's aversion to a two-state solution. By 2007, the West Bank Jewish settler population had reached 282,000. In East Jerusalem, it rose to 200,000, massively Judaising the city and precluding it as a Palestinian capital. Today the West Bank is a jigsaw of settlements, bypass roads and barriers, making an independent state impossible. Gaza is a besieged enclave. In 2006 the UN special rapporteur in the Palestinian territories concluded that \"a two-state solution is unattainable\". Avraham Burg, former Knesset speaker, told the Israeli daily Haaretz in June that \"time was running out for the two-state solution\".</p> <p>Scores of others have articulated the same view. The peace process predicated on the two-state solution is stagnant, and a momentum has started towards the obvious alternative, a unitary state. This month a new forum, encompassing Palestinian personalities from the occupied territories and outside, has published a petition in the Arabic daily Al-Hayat to halt negotiations, annex the territories to Israel and demand equal rights in one state. This echoes many recent Palestinian demands to dissolve the Palestinian Authority and start an anti-apartheid campaign for equal rights. </p> <p>The UN high commissioner for human rights has referred us to Robert Serry, the UN official responsible for the peace process, who stated that UN policy must conform to the Palestinian formal position, the two-state solution. A change in that position is not unthinkable. For our resolution to be discussed at the UN, a member state would have to present it, and several are privately known to support our aims.</p> <p>A unitary state is inevitable. Establishing an exclusive state defined along ethnic-religious lines and excluding its previous inhabitants was unjust and ultimately unsustainable. No political acrobatics will alter this. The sooner the UN, which unwisely created Israel in the first place, takes charge of the consequences, the better it will be for Palestinians, for Israelis and for the region as a whole.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Ghada Karmi is research fellow at the Institute of Arab and Islamic Studies, Exeter University <a href=\"mailto:g.karmi@exeter.ac.uk\">g.karmi@exeter.ac.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Calling all developers! City air starting to get to you? Cramped London flat, endless noise and a rapidly expanding waistline? <strong>Yahoo</strong> could have the answer...</p> <p>Formally launched today, Yahoo's new research and development centre at Grenoble, in south-east France, already employs 220 engineers and has now overtaken London as Yahoo's biggest European research centre. So just what did the UK miss out on when Yahoo chose to open in Grenoble?</p> <p>Grenoble has a significant heritage in the technology industry; <strong>Sun Microsystems</strong>, <strong>Hewlett Packard</strong> and <strong>Xerox</strong> are already here, and Yahoo itself came to Grenoble when it <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2004/mar/26/yahoo.digitalmedia\">bought the shopping site <strong>Kelkoo</strong></a> four years ago. It likes to think of itself as the Silicon Valley of Europe. Today's official opening was marked with no small amount of fanfare - ribbon cutting and all - and an inauguration speech by <strong><a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/lists/2007/11/biz-07women_Christine-Lagarde_24M5.html\">Christine Lagarde</a></strong>, France's formidable minister for economy, industry and employment.</p> <p><br><em>Christine Lagarde, French minister for the economy, industry and employment</em></p> <p>She told a swooning audience of French journalists, local dignitaries and Yahoos about changes implemented by Sarkozy's government in employment law in the past few months that make it much easier for multinationals to take employ in France; that, and a tax credit for research business that gives 30% back to the company, effectively tripling research budgets. Lagarde also said it was time to move away from the stereotype of France as a country of people who take long holidays and eat good food: \"There is another France, and it is the one you have fallen in love with and invested in.\"</p> <p>In turn <strong>John Linwood</strong>, Yahoo's senior vice president for international engineering, said Lagarde represented a \"a new energy in France about encouraging investment and attracting multinational companies\".</p> <p>\"We operate in a very competitive, multinational world,\" said Linwood. \"We do development all over the world, but it's important to find locations where we can find talent, work with the government and grow our business in an environment that is friendly to that. These changes have made it much more attractive as a company [to invest in France].\"</p> <p>Yahoo announced in March that it is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/mar/14/technology.yahoo\">shifting its European headquarters from London to Switzerland</a> - a decision due, in no small part, to various tax advantages, as well as a general cost-saving drive following months of shareholder frustration about the company's flagging share price. Is this just the next phase of moving out of over-priced London?</p> <p>\"You can see a number of other companies are considering their position within the UK,\" said <strong>Tim O'Donoghue</strong>, vice president for Yahoo engineering in Europe and Canada. \"A number have gone to Ireland and it's for those sort of reasons that the business looked at where best to locate the headquarters.\"</p> <p>Linwood added that Grenoble is not replacing London, and said a fifth of the staff there are still research based. \"We're not divesting from London. We have and continue to have a strong research presence there and if you look at our research centres they are magnets for all sorts of talent pools. You can't get it all in one location.\"</p> <p>\"There's a worldwide shortage of good tech talent,\" said Linwood. \"It's very difficult to attract and retain good talent, and that's not something unique to Yahoo but that happens to everyone.</p> <p>\"Worldwide the Yahoo strategy is to be in a number of places around the world where we can tap talent pools, looking at universities producing good graduates, actively partnering with universities, in Grenoble, for example, and working with them to help develop their curricula.\"</p> <p>The UK is strong on front end engineering and web development, media consumer internet and mobile, he said, while Grenoble is focusing on recommendation for Yahoo Answers, semantic search technology and the weighty service management that keeps Yahoo's services running.</p> <p>Yahoo Answers, which is a kind of question and answers tool with answers written and rated by users, has its research base at Grenoble. The service has 140 million users each month, Yahoo claims - more than the combined population of the UK and France.</p> <p>Answers has \"an aggressive roadmap of functionality,\" said O'Donoghue, and will integrate research on user relevance and information from social networks that can help determine the most relevant information for a user.</p> <p>Linwood said that <strong>Brickhouse</strong> - Yahoo's California-based concept incubator project and home of <strong>Fire Eagle</strong> - is in the process of being \"reinvented\", but said the favoured way of prioritising new projects is to identify a business need and ask teams to brainstorm prototypes that would solve those.</p> <p>Outside Europe, Yahoo has research centres in Haifa in Israel, Barcelona, Bangalore, Taipei, Taiwan and of course Sunnyvale in California, but also small centres in Brazil,Hong ong, Japan and Korea. What Grenoble offers is an existing tech community and a huge community of science and technology students; they account for more than 60,000 of Grenoble's wider population of around 250,000. London might be strong on mobile and creative web development, but can it match that combination of talent, tax breaks and quality of life?</p> <p>It doesn't seem to matter where in the world developers are; the language of the web - not to mention the Yahoo-branded desk detritus, in-geek joke screen savers and table football - is pretty international. That said, there aren't many offices where it's quite normal to fit in a snowboarding session before work.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Coming shortly: audio interview with Tim O'Donoghue.</em></p>",
  "<p>We had a Googlephone at the Guardian today, but not officially: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinton_Cerf\">Vint Cerf</a> came in to be grilled for lunch, and Google's excellent PR minder, Anthony House, was using his G1 for email. I was obviously concentrating on other things at the time, but it reminded me of the old Sidekick device, only much smaller. I'd guess anyone who has used earlier HTC phones with slide-out keyboards would spot the family resemblance, it seemed to be responsive, and it was certainly effective for making calls. But it also didn't look glamorous enough to attract iPhone, Nokia N95 or BlackBerry Curve/Bold users. As ZD Net's <a href=\"http://blogs.zdnet.com/cell-phones/?p=132\">Matthew Miller puts it</a>:<br></p> <blockquote> <p>It has its strengths and weaknesses and is not bad for a first generation device, but it isn't the ground breaking, blow-me-away type of device I was looking for from Google and HTC. </p> </blockquote> <p>Some of the G1's limitations are a bit bizarre. For example, it locks you to one Google account, and a lot of us have at least two (one business, one private). You can use the IMAP facility to run a second Gmail account, but it's less than ideal. Also, you can only watch YouTube videos -- and given the iPhone's shortcomings in the video department, you might have thought Flash would be an obvious feature.</p> <p>The G1 also doesn't offer synchronisation with Microsoft Outlook, which is silly. The ability to cross-sync multiple devices via Outlook, and have them business-ready in a couple of minutes, is what keeps multiple device users sane. Synchronisation with Google is nice if you're a new born baby and have no prior attachments (or you're geek enough not to have a life), but people with a decade or two of baggage have usually got it stashed in Outlook. Miller says:</p> <blockquote> <p>There is no support for Exchange or BlackBerry syncing services and no way to sync even to Outlook via a cable. There is no ability to tether the device to your laptop and I am not sure that developers will be able to provide this. You can view Office attachments sent in an email and they do look quite good, but there are no editing, zooming, or saving capabilities. I asked about a notes or task list application and was told for the 1000th time that developers may provide this. I think enterprise wants more control than this for security and standardization and it just isn't an enterprise device. Nothing syncs or connects to a PC and there is no central Google webpage to manage all your data or apps so you can quickly go to an \"Android data management page\", like there is for the Sidekick. Apps can only be purchased on the phone with no desktop option and the ability to back them up concerns me a bit. </p> </blockquote> <p>If someone could put a G1 on a Microsoft <a href=\"https://www.mesh.com/Welcome/Welcome.aspx\">Live Mesh</a> ring, of course, some of those problems would be solved\u2026..</p> <p>It's also not clear how far it's locked to T-Mobile, though apparently you can get it unlocked after 90 days. This can be important if you travel, because you may well want to stick in a different SIM for use abroad. </p> <p>The lack of a <a href=\"http://blog.wired.com/gadgets/2008/09/annoying-no-sta.html\">standard headphone jack</a> is also a silly annoyance, particularly for people who use their mobile phones as music players.</p> <p>Anyway, I've seen enough to know I won't be in the queue to buy one. And I suspect it won't be a long queue, unless T-Mobile follows the Orange Poland trick of <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idUSN215519020080821\">paying actors to stand in line</a> for iPhones\u2026.</p>",
  "<p>The US government has yielded to an outcry over multi-million dollar Wall Street pay packets by agreeing to impose limits on the remuneration of senior bankers who benefit from a $700bn bail-out of financial institutions.</p> <p>Treasury secretary Henry Paulson bowed to pressure after two days of tough negotiations with congressional lawmakers who are deeply reluctant to pass his program to buy up banks' distressed assets without a crackdown on perceived boardroom excess.</p> <p>\"The American people are angry about executive compensation, and rightly so,\" Paulson told the House financial services committee. \"We must find a way to address this in legislation without undermining the effectiveness of the program.\"</p> <p>The concession, which is likely to fuel momentum for similar measures in Britain, came as the Bush administration battled to overcome scepticism about the biggest public intervention in the financial markets since the Great Depression. </p> <p>Polls suggested that the US public are unenthusiastic about the bailout and Wall Street stocks slipped on doubts over the likelihood of an agreement this week. In an attempt to marshal support, the White House announced that President Bush would make a televised address about the financial crisis. </p> <p>Measures to reduce pay packages are set to include severe restrictions on \"golden parachutes\" given to executives when they leave their jobs. Wall Street sources expect a clawback on bonuses if companies re-state their financial performance and legislation to prohibit performance-related incentives which encourage inappropriate risk.</p> <p>Such changes are an about-turn for a laissez-faire Republican administration which last year rejected Congressional attempts to give shareholders a British-style \"say on pay\" vote at American companies. A crackdown poses a personal dilemma for Paulson who earned $38m as head of Goldman Sachs in 2005 before joining the government.</p> <p>In heated exchanges on the issue, Democratic congressman Luis Guitterez told Paulson: \"We are asking American taxpayers to sacrifice, to put $700bn out there when other people are lining their pockets.\"</p> <p>Paulson replied: \"People in the country understand pay for performance for success - that's the American dream. But nobody understands pay for failure.\"</p> <p>Critics of Wall Street point out that Lehman Brothers' chief executive, Dick Fuld, received nearly $35m in pay last year. Merrill Lynch's former boss Stan O'Neal left with $161m in stock and options when he was ousted due to huge losses on subprime mortgages in October.</p> <p>A poll released by the Los Angeles Times and Bloomberg showed that 55% of Americans oppose government aid to failing financial firms, in a sign that treasury secretary Henry Paulson is struggling to sell the scheme successfully. Paulson is staying in Washington to continue defending the plan and has turned down an invitation to meet Gordon Brown in New York today.</p> <p>The administration delivered increasingly dire warnings of the consequences of inactivity. The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben Bernanke, said global markets were under \"extraordinary stress\" and that action was \"urgently required\". The White House press secretary, Dana Perino, said there was a risk of \"financial calamity\" as \"the cold on Wall Street could affect main street\".</p> <p>As concern mounted in the markets, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 29 points to 10,825. Morgan Stanley's shares slumped 11% as takeover talks with the commercial banking group Wachovia ended.<br>Deutsche Bank analysts said the market was \"skittish\" on concerns that the Treasury may get less than the $700bn it wants, with the possibility of strings attached. Tobias Levkovich, chief US equity strategist at Citigroup, said \"bailout fatigue\" was setting in.</p> <p>\"A real sense of crisis has eluded many members [of Congress] who may not fully grasp the linkage between financial markets and their impact on the people of Main Street who elect their representatives in government,\" said Levkovich in a note to clients.</p> <p>The Los Angeles Times's poll was not the only attempt to read the US public's pulse on the financial crisis. CNN found that 62% of Americans support government involvement in the markets but 65% believe that any bailout would be unfair to taxpayers. Several tongue-in-cheek websites sprung up in which Americans offered junk for sale to the Treasury at inflated prices \u2013 on one, contributors offered a broken printer for $300 and a Bollywood poster for $4.76m.</p> <p>Former president Jimmy Carter joined the chorus of criticism, describing Paulson's plan as \"extremely faulty\" in lacking checks and balances: \"It's only three pages in outline. It gives him dictatorial power with no supervision.\"</p> <p>Senior Wall Street names have offered their services in helping the treasury to buy up investments. Bill Gross, who manages the world's biggest bond fund, Pimco, said he would help the treasury manage the program free of charge.</p> <p>A sense of anger over Wall Street's role in sparking the meltdown was fuelled by news that the FBI is investigating the possibility of fraud at four troubled firms caught up in financial turmoil - AIG, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Lehman Brothers.</p> <p>Doubts about the program cut across party lines. One-time Republican presidential hopeful Ron Paul summed up the tumult: \"I don't know who the conservatives are and who the liberals are.\"</p>",
  "<p>John McCain today proposed postponing the first presidential debate so he and Barack Obama could stay in Washington and help Congress craft an economic rescue package. Obama swiftly rejected the idea of rescheduling Friday's event.</p> <p>McCain proposed the two candidates \"suspend\" their campaigns and meet with fellow senators and others in Washington, saying the economic turmoil facing the country requires they put partisan politics on hold to work toward a solution.</p> <p>In a press conference in Florida shortly after the McCain announcement, Obama said the debate should go forward as planned.</p> <p>\"This is exactly the time when the American people need to hear from the person who in approximately 40 days will be responsible for dealing with this mess,\" Obama said. \"It is going to be part of the president's job to deal with more than one thing at once.\"</p> <p>The University of Mississippi, which is hosting the Friday debate, said the event would happen.</p> <p>During his press conference, McCain called for cooperation between Democrats and Republicans on the bailout plan, invoking what he described as the post-September 11 atmosphere of bi-partisanship.</p> <p>\"I am confident that before the markets open on Monday we can achieve consensus on legislation that will stabilise our financial markets, protect taxpayers and homeowners and earn the confidence of the American people,\" he said. \"All we must do to achieve this is temporarily set politics aside, and I am committed to doing so.\"</p> <p>Obama said he was involved in negotiations even on the campaign tail, speaking daily with congressional leaders and treasury secretary Henry Paulson, leader of the Bush administration effort. Obama added, \"If I can be helpful, then I am prepared to be anywhere, any time\".</p> <p>Obama said he and McCain earlier today discussed releasing a joint statement outlining principles they agree should be a part of the rescue package. He said McCain suggested suspending the debates, but added the announcement caught him by surprise.</p> <p>The move on McCain's part comes on the heels of bad news for his campaign, including reports this morning that top aide Rick Davis's consulting firm received substantial sums of money from mortgage company Freddie Mac, which is at the centre of the turmoil in the US banking system.</p> <p>The worsening economic situation has seen voters increasingly turning to Obama as the candidate best able to lead the country through the crisis. A Washington Post/ABC News poll this morning showed Obama leading 52% to 43% among likely voters. The poll shows voters trust Obama more to handle the economy, 53% to 39%.</p> <p>McCain said today he was driven to put the campaign on hold by the thus-far fruitless congressional debate on President Bush's proposed rescue plan. The plan, presented to legislators on Sunday, includes a $700bn bailout of the mortgage industry, and lawmakers are considering additional provisions to limit the pay of executives at the top of failing firms and to protect homeowners caught up in bad mortgages.</p> <p>Meanwhile, McCain told an Ohio television station yesterday that he had not had seen the Bush proposal \"in writing\".</p> <p>Neither McCain nor Obama hold leadership positions in the Senate, and senators involved in the negotiations have not indicated publicly that the men's absence is holding back progress on the economic rescue legislation.<br>Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell pronounced McCain's proposal \"an outstanding idea\" and said he hoped the Obama campaign would consider it.<br>Independent senator Joseph Lieberman, a former Democrat who now backs McCain, also praised McCain's idea and said Obama should return to the Senate too. </p> <p>Democrats were quick to dismiss McCain's move as a ploy, with New York senator Charles Schumer, a top hand in the bailout legislation negotiations, labelling it \"weird\".</p> <p>Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid said the candidates' return would inject presidential politics into the sensitive negotiations and \"distract important talks about the future of our nation's economy\".</p> <p>\"If that changes, we will call upon them,\" Reid said. \"We need leadership, not a campaign photo op.\"</p> <p>Erick Mullen, a Washington Democratic strategist, said McCain's move is a cynical effort to distract voters from the economic situation.</p> <p>\"After a decade of suspending any activity in the Senate which could have prevented this meltdown, his call today to silence the national conversation is reckless but typical of his half-cocked worldview,\" Mullen wrote in an email. \"When someone read him the latest news about Davis, the polls and Palin's tepid reception at the UN, he wants to change the subject.\"</p>",
  "<p>A <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jl4HIc-yfgM\">new video</a> has emerged showing Sarah Palin, John McCain's running mate, playing a central role in a church service in Alaska in which witchcraft is denounced.</p> <p>Thomas Muthee, a Kenyan who is a regular preacher at Palin's local Pentecostal church in Wasilla, made a passionate plea to defeat witchcraft and other supposed enemies of Palin during a sermon three years ago.</p> <p>The role of the witchfinder in Palin's life raises new questions about how much McCain's team investigated her background before naming her as his vice-presidential running mate.</p> <p>The new video, available on YouTube, shows Palin standing in front of him at the service, head bowed, her hands held by two members of the congregation.</p> <p>Muthee, in the sermon, calls on members of the church to try to gain footholds in centres of influence, such as politics and the media, and praises Palin for her bid to become governor of Alaska. He spoke about the hindrances she faced from her enemies.</p> <p>\"In the name of Jesus, in the name of Jesus, every form of witchcraft is what you rebuke. In the name of Jesus, in the name of Jesus, father make away now,\" Muthee said.</p> <p>In a video that emerged last week, Palin, in a speech to the church on June 8 this year, thanked Muthee for his help in getting her elected governor. She said his invocation was \"very, very powerful\".</p> <p>The Democratic candidate, Barack Obama, faced weeks of damaging reports earlier this year over his links to his controversial Chicago pastor, Jeremiah Wright, who was accused of being unpatriotic. The links between Palin and Muthee have the potential to damage her candidacy.</p> <p>The Christian Science Monitor reported that Muthee, while in Kenya, led a campaign to find the source of alleged witchcraft after a series of fatal car accidents in Kiambu. He blamed a local woman called Mama Jane, who is reported to have been forced to leave the area.<br>Muthee, in a promotional video, said: \"We prayed, we fasted, the lord showed us a spirit of witchcraft resting over the place.\"</p> <p>McCain's campaign team has largely kept Palin away from the media. But she is doing occasional interviews and faces a debate with her opposite number, Joe Biden, next week, both of which offer a chance for witchcraft to be raised.</p>",
  "<p>Laos, one of the poorest countries in south-east Asia, with few resources beyond its mighty rivers and unspoilt natural beauty, is under threat from a plethora of dam projects and foreign companies hellbent on harnessing the surging torrents.</p> <p>Environmental specialists and NGOs report that rivers are being ruined, fish stocks rapidly depleted, and thousands of villagers uprooted from their homes.</p> <p>The World Bank and the Asian Development Bank have strongly pushed the Laotian government, with its meagre human resources, to open up their rivers to hydroelectric power (HEP) as the key to development.</p> <p>Among the western and Chinese companies plundering the natural resources of Laotian waterways are Norwegian ones. Norway, which usually prides itself on respect for the environment and human rights, is not among the usual suspects of countries that ride roughshod over local communities and their livelihoods.</p> <p>You don't expect Norway, with its record of stringent environmental standards at home, to be accused of flouting rules for environmental impact assessments (EIAs), ignoring dangers and ruining important rivers by cutting corners in dam construction. But that is exactly what it is doing through with its participation in the Theun-Hinboun Power Company (THPC) according to respected British scientist Dr Murray Watson, hired as an environmental specialist to implement the EIA under the control of a Norwegian consulting company Norplan.</p> <p>Only recently, the Norwegian government <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/09/riotinto.ethicalbusiness?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=business\">withdrew</a> its \u00a3500m pension fund investment in Rio Tinto Zinc on the grounds of what Norway's finance minister, Kirsten Halvorsen termed \"an unacceptable risk of contributing to grossly unethical conduct\". </p> <p>In this high-profile case, Norway's reputation for green ethics was enhanced, but there is no sign of the same principles being applied to little-known dams in Laos.</p> <p>In 2004 Watson's research consultancy body <a href=\"http://www.rmruk.com/Theteam.html\">RMR</a> was contracted to conduct the EIA for the Theun-Hinboun dam expansion project in the country.</p> <p>But Watson's findings about serious environmental damage were either deleted or ignored from the Norwegian company's presentation of the EIA.</p> <p>Time and again compliant EIA consultants have played down the environmental dangers, to enable a controversial project to proceed smoothly. But Watson blew the whistle, went public and <a href=\"http://www.internationalrivers.org/en/southeast-asia/laos/theun-hinboun/lao-dam-cover-scientist-protests-deceptive-eia-report\">informed the media</a>.</p> <blockquote> <p>In the last 30 years working as an EIA practitioner in Africa and south-east Asia, RMR have not seen any EIA report which so steadfastly supports the developer's actions and plans, against the interests of other stakeholders and the national environment.</p> </blockquote> <p>The statement he made continues: \"They are deceiving the Laos government. The costs of these impacts [from the Theun-Hinboun dam] will definitely seriously impoverish 10,000-15,000 people, probably will moderately impoverish a further 10,000-15,000.\"</p> <p>Norplan has closed down the EIA since it delivered its wildly inaccurate report, and their only response has been to say that the company has no power to amend its draft final report now that the contract term has expired.</p> <p>Never mind that Watson, the chief expert, has presented a dossier to show that the report is riddled with deception and has totally dissociated himself from its conclusions. It appears the integrity and accuracy of the EIA and the welfare of the people of Laos is of less concern than the date of expiry of the contract.</p> <p>Sadly, there is no indication that the Norwegian government is concerned about its tarnished reputation in Laos, despite the direct involvement of Statkraft, the state-owned electricity company, which has a 20% in the THPC. Construction is now set to commence.</p> <p>\"I am stunned that Statkraft and Norplan \u2013 companies from one of the richest and most advanced countries in the world \u2013 would put their name and reputation behind such abysmal studies. This shows that they care little about the fate of some of the poorest people in south-east Asia\", said <a href=\"http://www.internationalrivers.org/en/southeast-asia/laos/theun-hinboun/theun-hinboun-dam-nightmare-revealed-resettlement-plan-and-eia-rid\">Aviva Imhof</a>, campaigns director of International Rivers Network. </p> <p>Why such a stark contradiction between Oslo's ethical concern over Rio Tinto Zinc's operations and the neglect of similar issues in Laos?</p> <p>In this case Oslo has ignored all protests, including those of the Norwegian NGO <a href=\"http://www.fivas.org/sider/tekst.asp?side=1\">Fivas</a>. Andrew Preston, the director of Fivas agues that it is untenable for Statkraft, a company with ambitions of being a world leader in the provision of \"clean energy\", to continue investing in this Laotian dam project.</p> <p>Other prospective dam projects in Laos and China seriously threaten the future of one of the world's great rivers \u2013 the Mekong \u2013 which provides food, security and livelihoods for an estimated 70 million people.</p> <p>The machinations of Norwegian companies, in brushing aside the evidence and ignoring Watson's principled protests, could do enormous damage Oslo's reputation for taking ethical concerns seriously.</p> <p>But much worse than that: by abandoning certain standards, it sets the worst possible example to all the other dam developers. Unless some environmental checks are put in place, future generations of fishermen along the banks of the Mekong and other rivers will be reduced to uttering a plaintive cry of \"Where have all the fish gone?\"</p>",

  "<p>You might have seen a recent headline about Sony's announcement of its new \"Open Market\" digital rights management consortium, with the strapline \"Let 1000 retailers bloom.\" </p> <p>The idea is to kick the pins out from underneath Apple's DRM scheme (\"let a single retailer bloom\") by forging an alliance of use-control companies who agree to share DRM-crippled works between their devices. Right now, your Blu-Ray videos are tied to Blu-Ray players, but if Sony has its way, you'll be able to move them to other restrictive platforms, provided the manufacturers of those platforms are part of Sony's consortium.</p> <p>If you're a DRM junkie, this will sound awfully familiar: it's functionally indistinguishable from a failed consortium called Coral, though Coral required your devices to contact its servers more often than Open Market will.</p> <p>Big deal.</p> <p>Coral failed for several reasons, but most importantly it failed because successful DRM companies don't join DRM consortia. Once a song, movie, game or book is crippled with DRM, it's illegal to make a player that can run it, unless you have the DRM company's permission. That means that if Sony-BMG Music created a player that could play back its own DRM songs from the iTunes store, they'd be violating Apple's copyrights \u2013 even though it holds the copyrights in the music itself. </p> <p>So if Sony wants to wean its listeners off iPods and onto Walkmans, it has to convince anyone who has bought iTunes DRM music to abandon those tracks and buy them again from a Sony DRM store or some other retailer with compatible DRM (or no DRM at all).</p> <p>This is a cat-bird seat for Apple. It gets incredible, Wal*Mart-grade control over its suppliers, right down to pricing and placement. Every time it sells another DRM song or video or audiobook (Apple offers higher-priced DRM-free music, but all its audiobooks and videos are still encumbered with DRM), it strengthens this control, because every DRM-locked file it sells adds to the cost of moving away from Apple's devices to a competitor's.</p> <p>Coral and Open Market are like a treaty negotiation where only one side has bothered to sign up. It's like getting all the kids in your class to \"agree\" that they're getting top marks on their exams \u2013 and then denouncing the teacher for his failure to recognise the landmark accord.</p> <p>But let's say Open Market or something like it succeeds. Be afraid: these things are a one-way ticket to losing the rights to your media.</p> <p>Here's how DRM is supposed to work. Say you want to watch a movie but you don't care to own all the rights to it. You find a DRM vendor who's willing to sell you a subset of the rights at a discount so that, say, \"I can watch this movie in Europe, but not in the rest of the world\" (think of a Region 2 DVD). Or \"I can watch this movie for seven days, and only in the UK\" (BBC iPlayer) or \"I can watch this movie while it's playing over the air, but my PVR isn't allowed to record it\" (TiVo with CGMS/A). </p> <p>Every one of these systems has a slightly different, mismatched vocabulary for expressing which restrictions accompany your media.</p> <p>When you move media from one device to another using a scheme like Coral or Open Market, they have to negotiate what restrictions you'll suffer on the new device. There's two ways of handling this: the devices can \"round up\" to a more liberal version of the restrictions (a movie going from BBC iPlayer to the DVD-based CSS would go from \"Watch in the UK for 7 days only\" to \"Watch anywhere in Europe forever\"), or they can \"round down\" (the iPlayer movie becomes non-playable at all on the CSS system).</p> <p>Coral handled this by rounding down, so that with each transfer of your media to a new device you lost a little something in the deal, until the permissions you held to the media had been whittled away to zero so that you couldn't use them at all.</p> <p>Will Open Market round up? Hardly. Rounding up provides a trivial way to remove <em>all</em> restrictions from media: just move it to a device whose two modes are \"No restrictions\" and \"No permissions.\" The rounding up transaction will strip all restrictions off the file.</p> <p>One of the things that makes digital media great is that there's no generation loss: there's perfect fidelity from one copy to the next. That's why I can still run the Logo programs I created in elementary school in 1979 on a computer manufactured in 2008. That's why I can play the MP3s I ripped from my CD collection in 1999 on a digital car stereo that ships today.</p> <p>Open Market is a product the market has no need for: a system for making digital copies rot, a system for making media less useful every time they are moved to a more powerful, more capable player.</p> <p>We weren't taken in by Coral and we won't be taken in by Open Market. I'll bet my MP3s on it.</p>",
  "<p>At 30, mystery probably surrounds the idea of anyone wanting to work over the age of 65. At 50, it's often a different story. All that freedom and stress-free hours of doing nothing can begin to appear as attractive as a three-month forced march barefoot through the Gobi desert.</p> <p>Why? For a variety of reasons, not least because saying goodbye to paid work, for the unprepared in this occupation-obsessed society, may also mean farewell to an adequate income, friends, a daily routine, status, self-respect and a sense of usefulness. Also, for a fit, active, experienced person with a lot to offer, it makes no rational sense. And that in itself is depressing.</p> <p>Chronological age isn't what it used to be. Once, marriage, parenthood, middle age and retirement followed in an orderly fashion. Now, parenthood can come at 40 or 50, marriage a decade later \u2013 but no matter how much spring in the step, at 65, any boss can show you the door and get away with it.</p> <p>Yesterday, an advocate-general, a senior legal advisor to the European court of justice, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/sep/23/workandcareers.discriminationatwork\">rejected</a> a challenge to the right of employers to make people retire at 65. The charity <a href=\"http://www.ageconcern.co.uk\">Age Concern</a> is challenging UK laws which, since 2006, have allowed employers to compel workers to retire at 65. Two hundred and sixty people in Britain have cases at employment tribunals which <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7629384.stm\">depend</a> upon the European court's ultimate decision.</p> <p>So, we have the ludicrous situation that a manager can't ask you whether you intend to start a family \u2013 but he can ask you how many candles you'll have on your next birthday cake. Around a third of employers have a mandatory retirement age, although not necessarily at 65.</p> <p>This retirement deadline has a ripple effect: if you are past your sell-by date at 65, then 50 doesn't look so hot either. One in three people over the age of 50 who would like to work are unable to find a job. B&amp;Q, the do-it-yourself chain with a pro-older employees policy, have tried hard to tackle this discrimination but it can't hire the entire workless vintage population of the UK.</p> <p>Ageism is a plague. Yet, ironically in a period that so overvalues youth that it eulogises the sexagenarian who from a distance manages to pass as an ing\u00e9nue \u2013 it works both ways. According to a survey by the <a href=\"http://www.efa.org.uk/age/facts.asp\">Employers Forum on Age</a> (EFA) published last year, firms continue to pay older people more, manage younger workers differently to older ones, and overlook younger staff for promotions irrespective of experience. <br> Despite nine out of 10 people knowing it is illegal to discriminate on the grounds of age at work, more than half of employees claimed to have witnessed ageist behaviour in the workplace in the past year. This level of discrimination says as much about poor management practice; narrowness of vision, stereotypical attitudes and bullying in the workplace as it does about the counterfeit battle of young versus old.</p> <p>It's a paradox that a time when individualism is once again on the rise \u2013 the ability to judge a person on their talents, abilities and merits does not seem to figure hugely in the workplace. Age is often such an irrelevant gauge of ability. Eventually, however, demographics may force a different approach, at least when it comes to the older age group.</p> <p>According to the EFA, by 2017 \u2013 just round the corner \u2013 there will be more people over 40 than under. From 2010, the number of young people reaching working age will begin to fall by 60,000 every year, fundamentally changing the shape of the workforce. The trouble is that the disparaging view of the older employer, apparently already embedded in the workplace, means that anyone working beyond 65 in a less than enlightened setting in decades to come, may face two choices.</p> <p>One is delusion, denial, facelifts and achieving the miracle of turning back the clock by lying about age. The other choice is to work, exuding \"gratitude\" for this second chance. A better option would be to introduce flexible working hours; the opportunity to take on two or three day contracts and a more inspired range of work hours that allows employment to taper into retirement much more gradually.</p> <p>Hopefully, in the retirement age struggle, this ruling is only a setback and Age Concern will win on appeal. But any change in the law also requires a cultural shift. In the US, for instance, <a href=\"http://www.civicventures.org/\">Civic Ventures</a> is a charity that offers newly-retired professionals over 55 (1,800 so far) opportunities to use their skills and experiences and give back to the community. The point is not what they do \u2013 but the belief that originally drove the late John Gardner, one of its founders, and his approach to an ageing population. \"The nation today faces breathtaking opportunities,\" says his website, \" \u2026 disguised as insoluble problems\". It doesn't take an old head to see that makes sense.</p>",
  "<p>CCTV images of Jean Charles de Menezes travelling on a bus just minutes before he was shot dead on the London Underground were shown at the inquest into his death today.</p> <p>The footage was captured as the 27-year-old Brazilian travelled to his work as an electrician from his south London home. The grainy pictures \u2013 played to a jury at the long-awaited hearing \u2013 show De Menezes boarding the No 2 bus in Tulse Hill, wearing a blue denim jacket and a black T-shirt on July 22 2005.</p> <p>Several minutes later the cameras captured an undercover surveillance officer, known only as Ivor, sitting a few seats in front of him. </p> <p>Another CCTV camera in Brixton recorded De Menezes getting off the bus before moving among a large crowd of people opposite Brixton tube station, which had been closed. Moments later, images capture him re-boarding the bus and sitting upstairs for the short journey to Stockwell. </p> <p>Other cameras - on the bus, at Stockwell underground station and on the train on which De Menezes was shot - were faulty, the inquest was told. </p> <p>Steve Reynolds, of the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), said no footage was recorded for a variety of reasons. Engineers had found excessive vibrations prevented several cameras on the bus recording. And a workman had stepped on a cable at Stockwell station severing the cameras on platform two from the recorder. </p> <p>He added that cameras on the train did not work because the recording unit had been removed as part of the inquiry into the suicide bomb attacks of July 7, a fortnight before. </p> <p>Nicholas Hilliard QC, for the inquest, said: \"It is not a complete picture of film on the bus by any means.\" </p> <p>The inquest into De Menezes' death was focusing on evidence recovered by the IPCC in the wake of the shooting.<br> Investigators painstakingly recreated a minute-by-minute account of the 33 minutes between the moment he left home and when he was shot seven times after being mistaken for a suicide bomber.</p> <p>Footage recorded by a surveillance officer known as Frank, hidden in a van near De Menezes's Scotia Road home was shown. It showed six people leaving the modern low-rise block of flats between 7.48am and 8.40am. Frank failed to capture De Menezes on film when he left at 9.33am because he was urinating in a bottle, the inquest was told.<br> A gym card owned by a failed suicide bomber, Hussain Osman, who had been one of four men who attempted an attack on London's underground the day before De Menezes was shot, had led police investigating the botched attacks to Scotia Road.</p> <p>Later, a cousin of De Menezes said the Brazilian had no reason to fear the police. Alex Pereira, 31, said De Menezes had been stopped by police up to four times, including once on a motorcycle in Park Lane. The police were \"very polite\" and De Menezes was not bothered by the encounters. </p> <p>Pereira said: \"We come from Brazil and it is very common for police to stop people there and even police carry a gun in Brazil so it does not scare us,\" he said. \"Why would he be scared of the police?\" </p> <p>A key member of the Justice 4 Jean campaign, Pereira said he and his cousin grew up together in a rural village in south-east Brazil. He said De Menezes was a self-taught electrician who dreamed of travelling to the US or England and went to Sao Paulo when he was 16 so he could earn money on a chicken farm. </p> <p>Periera said: \"He was a guy that liked to learn and he fought to make life better because he came from a place where everything is very difficult. It has become better now but at the time it was very, very hard and since he was a little boy he studied to become an electrician.\" </p> <p>De Menezes travelled to England after he was refused a US visa, he said. Once in the UK he sent money home to support his family and girlfriend, Adriana, who had a child from a previous relationship. </p> <p>Pereira said his cousin thought living abroad \"would bring a better life for everybody\". </p> <p>\"He studied hard and learned English quickly. He was prepared to do any work initially. But he was pleased when he found work as an electrician. He was very ambitious and worked very hard but he still enjoyed life. </p> <p>\"He was very happy in England and I thought he would like to stay here permanently eventually.\" </p> <p>In a statement read to the inquest from another cousin, Patricia da Silva Armani, said news of the shooting left their families devastated. </p> <p>De Menezes had telephoned her to see if she was all right after the failed July 21 bombings. When family members were called to Brixton police station she believed De Menezes had \"done something really bad\". </p> <p>Armani said: \"I thought he was in police custody and I did not realise it was the Stockwell shooting. When police started speaking I could not understand a lot of what was being said. Then I made the connection with the news. My head started spinning and my stomach was turning. </p> <p>\"Later we had to go and see his body in the mortuary. The news had not really sunk in. When I saw his body I fainted.\"</p>",
  "<p>A few weeks ago I wrote a quick post about the <a href=\"http://www.aqi.co.jp/product/ds10/en/index.html\">Korg DS-10</a> Synthesizer for DS, a miniaturised version of the famed Korg MS-10 synth, packed into a handheld console. It's due out in Europe on October 10 and I mentioned really wanting to get hold of a copy, as I once edited Korg's in-house magazine.</p> <p>Well, a couple of days later, what should pop through my letterbox? A copy of Korg DS-10 \u2013 Nintendo's PR office is really on its game. I can confirm after mucking about with it for a week, that this is a truly fascinating, if dauntingly comprehensive, piece of software. What you get is two analogue synths and a four-track drum machine to experiment with, all accessible through a simple touchscreen interface. The set-up takes the form of a flow chart, beginning with keyboard option, so you can tap out a basic tune, and ending with an FX panel so you can add trippy feedback and wet/dry effects to your noise. Along the way there's an edit screen to tweak elements like peak, delay and sustain and a 'synth patch' where virtual cables can be patched across from different ports to modify the synth tone. No, I'm not sure what I'm talking about, but it's fun messing about with it.<br><br>Best of all is the KAOSS Pad which lets you drag the stylus around the screen to warp and twist the sounds, sort of like a Rolf Harris Stylaphone re-imagined by Orbital. The drum machine is hugely adaptable too, providing a wealth of percussion options as well as pan and volume controls, which I have merely scratched the surface of.</p> <p>The great thing is, even if you have no idea what you're doing, you can trick some pretty amazing sounds out of it, by simply editing your demo in real-time, twisting various knobs and randomly patching cables as your short, mangled and repetitive techno monster gurgles and whines in the background. Once you're more familiar with how things actually work (and having instructions in English will give you a distinct advantage over me) you can start laying down and recording proper songs, using the 16-step sequencer for lush multilayered orchestrations.</p> <p>Those who can't afford a full-size Korg synth, or don't have a PC to try out one of the many synth sims available, will get a real feel for music construction on this thing. And when you're ready, there's an eight-player Wi-Fi jamming mode. Believe me, I'm not ready. But give me time.</p> <p>(Oh and watch the trailer <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rorBOzwR3Tc\">here</a> to see someone who clearly <em>does</em> know what he's doing...)</p>",
  "<p><strong>CHEATS, LOSERS AND ONE WINNER IN THIS CAS</strong></p> <p>West Ham are cheats. They stayed in the Premier League in 2006-07 because they cheated and then lied about their cheating. Their friends in the upper echelons of football administration and their biased southern-based media buddies have been protecting them ever since. They've tried to fib their way out of trouble, but, thankfully, they've been caught and the club should cough up 30m big ones and be delighted to get away so lightly. Sheffield United, meanwhile, are bad losers. They weren't good enough on the pitch and that's why they went down. They've been peddling myths about Carlos Tevez's ineligibility. They're a miserable bunch of northern whiners who can't accept that they were relegated because their team were useless and their desperate appeals for financial recompense are based on nothing but greed, envy and spite.</p> <p>That pretty much sums up the attitudes of Blades and Hammers fans towards one another as the Tevez affair rumbles on, with West Ham now expected to keep the case alive by turning to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne. West Ham will presumably argue that it isn't possible to prove Tevez was instrumental in keeping them up (which raises questions as to why the club bothered to break FA rules in order to keep a player who was obviously such a waste of space in their first XI) and that the ruling does not so much open a can of worms as rip the lid off a barrel of pythons. Anyway, it looks like everyone will have plenty more time to tell each other what an idiotic/pathetic/miserable/sad bunch of losers/cretins/northern-monkeys/southern-softies they are.</p> <p>CAS, you see, are busy people. Just last week they began the hearing for the Venezuelan Judo Federation and the Panamanian Judo Federation's case against the International Judo Federation. Next week they'll begin deliberating the Austrian cross-country skier J\u00fcrgen Pinter's hearing against the IOC and Wada and VfB Admira Wacker's complicated dispute with AC Pistoiese. Lausanne definitely isn't the place to go for a snap decision.</p> <p>So perhaps the only ones who should be rubbing their hands right now are the clubs' lawyers and the CAS arbitrators. It's not free to take a case to Lausanne. There's the \u00a38,000 admin fee, and the hourly rate for an arbitrator, of which there are three appointed to each case, is \u00a3125. Each arbitrator gets a daily \u00a375 expenses budget for meals, can stay in 'medium to luxury category' hotels with a budget of \u00a3175 a night, then there's the assorted transport costs, photocopying fees, secretarial rates, Velcro tax, pencil rent, briefcase insurance, yoghurt-based breakfast drink allowance, pocket fluff disposal charges, the list goes on and on. With procedures taking anywhere between six and 12 months, it's likely to prove another expensive outing.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"The fans sing, yell, and stand up and applaud.

  "<p>John McCain's campaign notched a little-noticed win today as congressional Democrats agreed to allow the US government's 26-year-old ban on oil drilling along the coastlines expire in six days.</p> <p>The Democratic turnaround on coastal drilling marks a stark reversal after months of battling between Barack Obama, who relaxed his opposition to offshore oil rigs over the summer after furious prodding from McCain \u2013 himself a recent convert to the practice.</p> <p>Although the drilling debate dominated the campaign dialog for much of last month, the McCain camp had little to say when Democrats announced late yesterday that their plan to fund the government until next spring would let the drilling ban expire.</p> <p>That silence is proof of the financial markets' sudden rise to the top of the US political agenda, as well as a recent decline in fuel prices. </p> <p>A few Democrats from coastal states, however, openly lamented their party's decision to give ground in the face of a White House veto threat on the funding plan.</p> <p>\"I think it's awful. This battle is not over,\" California senator Dianne Feinstein, an ardent opponent of coastal drilling, said. \"We will come back and fight another day, that's for sure.\"</p> <p>The expired ban is also a symbolic victory in many respects, because years of advance research are required before oil companies can begin building rigs within sight of the American coastlines.</p> <p>Still, McCain's fellow Republicans seized on a chance to claim victory, eagerly reminding voters that a Democratic president is likely to restore the offshore drilling ban in some form.</p> <p>\"With these bans no longer in place, work can begin to allow us to tap into our abundant oil and gas resources \u2014 if our leaders don't lock them back up next year,\" Pete Domenici, the senior Republican on the Senate energy committee, said in a statement.</p> <p>The Obama camp was also silent on the drilling ban, which is slated to expire on October 1 under a funding plan that could become law as soon as tomorrow.</p> <p>Environmental groups had hoped that a widespread ethics scandal at the mineral management service (MMS), the government agency that handles oil-company royalties from drilling, would erode support for new offshore rigs. </p> <p>But news reports of drug use and illicit sex within the MMS were pushed to the sidelines by the failing stock market and ultimately had little effect on political support for coastal drilling.</p> <p>In an apparent effort to accentuate the positive, the Sierra Club released a memo to reporters that urged caution and placed its hope in the next occupant of the White House.</p> <p>\"The moratorium could very well be restored by a new Congress and president who understand that more offshore drilling will do nothing to lower gas prices or solve our energy crisis,\" analysts at the influential environmental group wrote.</p>",
  "<p>\"I am also proud to be a mother and a wife,\" Ruth Kelly told the conference as she <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/24/ruthkelly.labour\">bade farewell</a> this morning with an unexpected, unscripted tribute not just to the achievements of the government but of her family too. Once again, the incompatibility of a full-on job with motherhood \u2013 elsewhere on Cif <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/24/ruthkelly.labourconference\">Martin Kettle calls it</a> parenthood, but that's aspiration not actuality \u2013 is brutally illustrated by a high profile resignation.</p> <p>It once seemed, briefly, that Westminster had finally found a route to equality. It wouldn't happen overnight, but all women shortlists and public scrutiny of the gender balance in government offered a certainty that it was on its way. Since then the moves have been more backward than forward \u2013 and not only numerically. From Nicola Brewer, the new chief executive at the Equalities and Human Rights Commission, <a href=\"http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/article1654451.ece\">warning</a> that legislation risks protecting women out of the job market, to a succession of senior corporate resignations like <a href=\"http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2008/09/anita_smiths_resignation_attra.html\">Anita Smith</a>, chief executive of the insurers Capital Blue Cross, the climate for working mothers is becoming increasingly negative.</p> <p>It's tough for everyone. But a political career is uniquely demanding. It's not just the hours and days, the late nights and lost weekends, it's doing it all in the unrelenting glare of the public eye. A councillor who lost her seat in May after 10 years remarked to me this morning that politics is the only job where defeat is greeted with cheers and applause.</p> <p>At Westminster, the career appraisal is not once a year, it's every day. And it's not on the basis of an impartial series of benchmarks, it's prejudice, or political or simply gossip. It's not only women who are deterred by the unconsidered savagery of so much political discourse, of course, but when there so few of them every casualty counts.</p> <p>Ruth Kelly, with four children all born since she became an MP, a marginal seat and a painful row on the embryology bill looming, had more reasons than most to be considering her position. The suggestion from prime ministerial sources that she was about to be sacked \u2013 when she had decided to go anyway \u2013 must have incensed her. But her departure robs government of a woman who is not just a daily reminder of what can be done but also of someone who is going through a particular kind of experience. The irony of trying to promote gender equality is that just when you are most motivated to do something about it you are least able to do anything about it. You're bathing the kids.</p>",
  "<p>In the UK, youth knife crime has received a lot of attention recently. A <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7632386.stm\">high-profile trial</a> in Belgium has refocused public attention here on the issues of senseless violence, law and order, public apathy, immigration and racism.</p> <p>The story, in this case, really does begin with a \"regular Joe\". Joe van Holsbeeck was a popular, friendly and laid-back secondary school student looking forward to a bright future. On April 12 2006, the 17-year-old and his best friend were waiting for a girlfriend in Brussels's busiest transport hub, the Central Station. </p> <p>At around 4.30pm, two teenagers approached them, ostensibly to ask for directions, and then demanded that Joe hand over his MP3 player. When he refused, one of them took out a knife and, amid the rush-hour crowds, stabbed him seven times, including a fatal blow to the heart, according to the court doctor.</p> <p>Adam Giza, the killer, expressed remorse for his deed. \"I am sorry for what happened. I didn't want to kill him. I ask Joe's parents, his brother, and [his best friend] Gil for forgiveness\", the 19-year-old <a href=\"http://www.standaard.be/Artikel/Detail.aspx?artikelId=DMF23092008_018&amp;ref=front\">said</a> in his closing testimony before the verdict on Tuesday.</p> <p>That a young man should die for a music player and that it should happen in a busy public place caused public shock and outrage \u2013 not to mention, fear \u2013 at the time. Many people started calling for more policing and tougher punishment for offenders. </p> <p>\"We can't continue to sweep minor offences under the carpet. We need to take a 'zero tolerance' approach\", one resident told De Standaard. \"There aren't enough police agents? There are plenty of unemployed people around. Or why not use the army?\"</p> <p>Guy Verhofstadt, the then prime minister, said that the government must step up its fight against juvenile crime. But others questioned this fixation on policing and wondered how it was possible that Joe was killed in a train station through which some 200,000 commuters pass each day and how his attackers managed to get away.</p> <p>Cardinal Daneels, the country's top Catholic clergyman, condemned what he saw as society's growing apathy and materialism. \"Hundreds witnessed the murder but no one did anything\", the cardinal said in his 2006 Easter sermon. \"God asks us: where is your brother? Where is your Abel? We must not answer like Cain: 'am I my brother's keeper?'\"</p> <p>Glenn Audenaert, a Brussels police chief, echoed the cardinal's message, albeit in less Biblical terms. \"The police cannot be everywhere at once. Safety is a collective responsibility\", he said. </p> <p>While the cardinal and the police chief have a point about public apathy, what they overlook is that, in our modern, well-oiled, mechanical societies, we expect the \"system\" to take care of everything and many people find the potential consequences of intervention highly risky.</p> <p>On a personal level, I find myself far more confident and comfortable about intervening in societies where collective intervention is something of a norm. It is far less threatening for the individuals involved if an entire group of people break up a fight or mediate in a confrontation than if it is left to a lone passerby. If enough people cared, then getting involved would become less a question of heroics and more one of good citizenship.</p> <p>There is another aspect to the case \u2013 right-wing commentators have focused on the apparent ethnicity of the attackers, who were at first described as being of \"north African\" appearance.</p> <p>\"Belgian citizens realise \u2026 that the murder has nothing to do with 'indifference in Belgian society' but everything with a group of north African youths terrorising Brussels\", <a href=\"http://www.brusselsjournal.com/node/995\">Paul Belien</a> wrote in the Brussels Journal.</p> <p>But Joe's family refused to have their son's plight used for xenophobic grandstanding. \"Nobody should come to me, asking me to hate all Arabs\", his mother said in an interview with La Derni\u00e8re Heure. \"The youths who killed my son were scum \u2026 scum can be found everywhere.\"</p> <p>Some members of the far-right <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vlaams_Belang\">Vlaams Belang</a> (VB) even went so far as to suggest that gun ownership laws should be <a href=\"http://www.brusselsjournal.com/node/998\">relaxed</a> to allow citizens to \"defend\" themselves. </p> <p>The fact that Joe's attackers turned out to be Polish Roma left the envoys of social intolerance with egg on their face. Needless to say, it wasn't long before some focused on the attackers' \"gypsy\" identity \u2013 and, hence, illegal immigration \u2013 as somehow accounting for the violence. But they are obviously unaware that Giza feared the verdict of his own community, who never allow the re-admittance of rapists and murderers in their midst, over that of the court. </p> <p>Interestingly, a <a href=\"http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/belgian-extremist-gets-life-for-race-murder/2007/10/12/1191696176934.html\">racially-inspired shooting</a> by the nephew of a far-right politician in Antwerp less than a month later caused the VB to plea insanity on the part of a \"lone psychopath\", even though the gunman was deemed to be in full possession of his mental faculties and a jury found him guilty of being a \"racist murderer\".</p> <p>In a symbolic response to the charge of public apathy, 80-90,000 people took part, less than a fortnight after Joe's death, in a \"<a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4936990.stm\">silent march</a>\" in Brussels against senseless violence. It was the biggest public demonstration in Belgium since the \"white march\" against the paedophile and murderer Marc Dutroux. </p> <p>The brainchild of Fouad Ahidar, a Flemish politician of Moroccan descent, the silent march was well-attended by minorities in a clear demonstration that street violence and crime cannot be boiled down to ethnicity.</p>",
  "<p>Even before today, there was something weirdly compelling about the poster for Righteous Kill. The awful hair. The way Al Pacino's name hovers to the right of, but ever so slightly higher up than, Robert De Niro's (imagine how many hours of lawyers' time that gobbled up). The fact that it's so much naffer than <a href=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2287/2497546071_d8307c76a7.jpg\">this</a> early version, and even <a href=\"http://www.cinemablend.com/images/reviews/3057/_12131430449567.jpg\">this</a> one too, in which they've clearly just been caught snogging. And that parodically bravado tagline: \"There's nothing wrong with a little shooting as long as the right people get shot\". </p> <p>Then today, someone alerted me to a <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/anniemole/2884806904/\">photo</a> on <a href=\"http://www.popbitch.com/\">Popbitch</a> of the poster at Stockwell tube station, where, yesterday, the jury in the Jean Charles de Menezes case inspected the site where he was shot dead by police who thought he was a suicide bomber. Suddenly that tagline starts looking a little less funny.</p> <p>Unfortunate juxtapositions are an inevitable hazard of billboard advertising. A colleague reminds me that a poster for The Descent was on the side of the bus that blew up on 7/7. Posters for the Arnie film Collateral Damage were hastily removed on 12th September 2001. Last night on Comedy Connections' Rising Damp special you saw a horribly apt ad for the 1984 production of Joe Orton's undertaker comedy Loot, which Leonard Rossiter was starring in when he died backstage.</p> <p>Can you think of any more? And what is it that's interesting here, exactly? Do we just like a morbid laugh? Or does this sort of thing jolt you into feeling queasy about entertainment that treats death glibly? Anyway, I'm feeling slightly less keen to see Righteous Kill just now.</p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown's conference <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/23/gordonbrown.labour1\">speech</a> contained one announcement which is perhaps more important than many people realise: the prime minister's commitment to legislate for the goal of ending child poverty offers an important example of how entrenching Labour's legacy, defining its future agenda and testing the Conservative claim to be \"progressive\" all go together.</p> <p>David Cameron's whole argument is that he shares the \"progressive ends\" and disagrees about the means. But here is an important development, building on the climate change bill, where the supposed consensus on the \"end\" is what the government is asking the Conservatives to sign up for.</p> <p>This could be the reversal of the approach of challenging Cameron from the right of him (such as on 42 days, the income tax cut sparking the 10p fiasco, and ID cards) which has caused so many of the government's problems this year. Brown can only test Cameron from his progressive left, and the legislative pledge answers the specific challenge which we set out in the <a href=\"http://fabians.org.uk/publications/fabian-review/2008-party-conference-issue-progressive-fightback-fairness\">Fabian Review conference special</a>: \"An autumn fightback must involve popular, progressive policy tests of the warm words of political opponents, above all on finding the means to entrench the commitment to end child poverty as the progressive cause of this generation.\"</p> <p>How might the legislation work? It will be interesting to see what the detail is.</p> <p>The analogy to the climate change legislation could be to make a statutory commitment to reduce child poverty (for example, to reach by 2020 a level of child poverty at least 90% below the 1999 when the commitment to reduce and end child poverty was made) and then to set up an equivalent group to the Low Pay Commission or Monetary Policy Committee to report before each pre-budget report and budget as to progress towards this, and to assess and advise on the range of policy options necessary to get on track.</p> <p>That could be backed up by a statutory commitment to uprate benefits above inflation - real terms increases in key child benefits year on year. That would be a significant financial commitment. It's something the Conservatives would have to undo if they ever wanted to backtrack.</p> <p>But 20 years after a Conservative social security secretary John Moores declared (as child poverty trebled) that poverty had been abolished in Britain, his party must now decide whether to ditch Cameron's claim to share the aspiration to end child poverty or whether it will support landmark legislation to put an income inequality target on the statute book.</p> <p>It is an idea which ought to be anathema to Thatcherites \u2013 and a chance to see how deep the Cameron conversion of his party really runs.</p>",
  "<p>The remains of a baby boy that have been kept in a mortuary for 21 years will be buried on Friday without any relatives present after his family withdrew their consent for the funeral to go ahead. </p> <p>Christopher Blum's parents have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/jan/29/health.topstories3\">refused to bury their son</a>, who died when he was four months old, because they dispute the cause of his death. </p> <p>A pathologist named sudden infant death syndrome (Sids) as the cause, but Christopher's parents believe it was linked to a triple vaccination he received hours before his death. </p> <p>Enfield council will bury the boy's remains in a north London cemetery whether his family are there or not. </p> <p>The dead infant's father, Steve Blum, said today: \"My family will not take any part whatsoever in this extraordinary forced funeral of Christopher \u2014 it will be just that, a forced funeral. There will be no relatives there, no flowers and no contribution that could be seen as giving credibility to this.\"</p> <p><br>Blum said he was seeking an injunction to stop Friday's burial. He had previously cooperated with the council over the funeral arrangements but now says he still remains hopeful of further investigations into the cause of his son's death. He admitted that his lawyer felt all legal avenues had been exhausted. Blum has now approached a QC in the hope that he will lodge an injunction.</p> <p>Christopher's body has been kept in Hornsey mortuary, frozen at \u20138C and wrapped in a package at the back of an adult-sized drawer marked \"Baby Blum: Deceased\" that is rarely opened by staff. </p> <p>Enfield council, which has borne the \u00a315-a-week cost of storing the body, wrote to Blum telling him it wanted to move forward <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/jul/28/children.health\">\"to laying Christopher to rest\"</a>. </p> <p>It tried to include the family in the funeral arrangements, and Blum initially booked a provisional date of this Friday to allow travelling time for his ex-wife Mathilde and two of his three children who now live in the United States. But he said he cancelled it, because he wanted further investigations into his son's death. </p> <p>The council has since written again to the Blum family, notifying them that Christopher's remains will be collected from the mortuary by undertakers some time before Friday. </p> <p>\"The hearse will then travel to the small chapel at Lavender Hill cemetery where the undertakers will carry Christopher into the chapel,\" says the council's letter. \"At the chapel a minister will conduct a service before moving to the cemetery where Christopher will be laid to rest.\"</p> <p>The Guardian understands that a council officer has already registered the death and that the cause of death is written as Sids. The council is permitted to remove the body from the freezer and provide a funeral under the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984.</p> <p>The council expressed surprise when told by the Guardian that the Blum family did not intend to attend the funeral. A spokesperson said: \"Enfield council has involved Mr Blum in the arrangements for Christopher's funeral. The planned date of 26 September 2008 was chosen by Mr Blum. He confirmed the date in writing to the council on 14 August 2008. The council agreed to this date, in recognition of Mr Blum's wish to allow time for family to travel from America.</p> <p>\"The choice of funeral route and cemetery has also been made in accordance with Mr Blum's wishes. The council very much hopes that Christopher can now be laid to rest with the dignity and respect we would all wish for him on Friday morning.\"</p> <p>Acknowledging that he had changed his mind, Blum said: \"In this last week, I have been feeling gutted in my stomach just like I felt after Christopher died. Going to the funeral as if to support the actions of the council is out of the question.\"</p> <p>On the day he died in June 1987, Christopher's mother had taken him to North Middlesex hospital. He was sick after he received his vaccination for whooping cough, polio and tetanus.</p> <p>\"He threw up straight away,\" said his father. \"They sorted that out and he came home. He was sort of lethargic. We put him to bed about seven or eight in the evening. I went to check him at about half past nine. His fists were clenched up to the sides of his head and his face was down on the pillow. </p> <p>\"I picked him up and as soon as I did I knew something was wrong. He wasn't floppy like a baby, he was rigid. There was blood coming out of his nose. I screamed and went running downstairs with him. My neighbour tried to give him the kiss of life and was pushing his chest. We suspected the vaccine straight away.\"</p> <p>Blum challenged the results of two postmortem examinations with the backing of Action for Victims of Medical Accidents (Avma), but the group no longer supports him. His demand for an inquest was refused.</p> <p>The council has agreed to pay the funeral costs and told the family that \"given the possible media interest\" it would \"be arranging for colleagues to be discreetly available should this be necessary to ensure that Christopher, you and other family members can have a dignified funeral\". </p> <p>Blum said: \"Oh God, I am so depressed that this is going ahead. I have had the worst couple of weeks I have had in the years since Christopher's death. I can't believe this is happening.\"</p> <p>The Blums' boycott of the funeral echoes that of Jim Campbell, who refused to attend the burial of his mother in Dumfries in 2004 after a dispute between his family and the council over her final resting place. </p> <p>Jean Campbell's body, which had lain frozen in a mortuary for four years, was buried with just 10 people \u2013 undertakers and council workers \u2013 in attendance. Her daughter, Catherine, arrived with flowers after the funeral ended.</p>",
  "<p>It was almost inevitable that questions over Portsmouth's ownership arose after their 6-0 drubbing at the hands of Manchester City. Most of us would probably be too embarrassed to own up in the aftermath of such a mauling. Alas there was more than just shame at work when the credentials of Pompey's owner, Alexandre Gaydamak, were called into question this week. </p> <p>No, it has nothing to do with the fact that Alexandre was, according to newspaper reports, prepared to sell the club for \u00a360m. Instead, it emerged that all might not be as it seems at Fratton Park after the Israeli tabloid Yedioth Ahronoth published a list of the assets held by Alexandre's father, the effervescent Israeli-Russian billionaire Arkadi Gaydamak. Portsmouth were listed as one of his, and not his son's, concerns. The club and, of course, the family themselves have vehemently denied the allegations, and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2008/sep/23/premierleague.portsmouth\">the Premier League seems satisfied with their explanation</a>. Yet nothing is ever simple when it comes to the Gaydamaks. </p> <p>That sounds a little melodramatic, so let me explain. This is merely the latest in a long line of controversies to surround Arkadi Gaydamak. To start with there is the widely reported French arrest warrant still outstanding for alleged gun running in Angola and tax evasion. But this is only the beginning of the story, one that could end with Gaydamak Snr being elected to one of the most sensitive political posts in the Middle East.</p> <p>Even in Israel, little has been known about the complicated origins of the Gaydamak millions. When Arkadi burst on to the scene three years ago, purchasing Israel's biggest football team Beitar Jerusalem and bankrolling them to a title almost immediately, few questioned where the money came from. </p> <p>\"It is a bit like in England, we don't know a lot about Sacha [Alexandre's nickname],\" said Shaul Adar, an Israeli journalist based in London. \"Does he have any money of his own? How did he get it? He came into the public domain out of nowhere, like his father. Arkadi met [life-long Beitar fan Ehud] Olmert. He asked to donate money, and the next day he was the owner [of Beitar]. In the few months he was the most famous person in Israel, he was on TV all the time and he came over quite eccentric. He was the Israeli Abramovich.\" </p> <p>Beitar has dominated Israeli football ever since but that wasn't enough. Arkadi had political ambitions, setting up his own Social Justice party and announcing he was to stand in the November 11 Jerusalem mayoral election. His outspoken, maverick persona has more than a touch of the John McCain about it: a right-wing populist that can spring the odd surprise, indulge in some political madness and provoke grudging admiration all at the same time. His purchase of Beitar, who arguably boast one of the most racist terraces in world football, immediately hoisted his flag for the political right. This, after all, was a team whose fans regularly sung songs wishing 'death to the Arabs' whilst refusing to accept an Arab playing for the club. </p> <p>Yet he was also responsible for donating money to the Israeli Arab football team Bnei Sakhnin when they were close to going under after relegation from the Ligat Ha'al. Sakhnin's chairman Mazen Genaim told me that Gaydamak was \"a great man\". It was his money that stopped the team going bankrupt. Indeed, he even tried to sign an Arab player, Abbas Suan, but the Beitar faithful weren't ready and rioted. </p> <p>Last season Gaydamak became increasingly exasperated by his fans' behaviour, first for continually singing racist chants, then for whistling through a minute's silence to mark the assassination of Labor prime minister Yitzhak Rabin, then when a group of Beitar's fans trashed the Israeli FA's offices in Tel Aviv and daubed death threats on its walls, and then, finally, for the two-point penalty that followed a pitch invasion in last season's title decider. </p> <p>\"The idiot bastards can leave,\" Gaydamak said of the hardcore troublemakers at his club. \"The fans that went wild yesterday are bastards, and I have no respect for them. While their numbers are in the thousands, they are not the majority.\" He has even had his own 'Palin moment', stating his desire to appoint an Arab deputy mayor if he is elected, a move that would do more than any other candidate to engage East Jerusalem's reticent Palestinian population.</p> <p>Then there's the philanthropy. Gaydamak has sunk millions of shekels into schemes that have seen him outmanoeuvre established political foes. When the town of Sderot on the Israeli/Gaza border came under a barrage of rocket attacks in the spring of 2007, Olmert, who had by now fallen out with Arkadi, got the mood of the nation totally wrong, insisting that its residents should sit tight and weather the storm. Any evacuation, he reasoned, would be a propaganda gift for Hamas. </p> <p>With graphic pictures showing the residents of Sderot cowering in their basements gripping the Israeli public, Gaydamak had other ideas and rode to the rescue, setting up a luxury tent city in Tel Aviv's Hayarkan Park and laying on buses to evacuate all those who feared for their lives. The camp was staffed with gourmet chefs, tents with Playstation 2s for the kids to play on, and a nightly cabaret. The staff liberally handed out black and gold Beitar scarves. Even earlier this month he paid $13,500 out of his own pocket for the medical treatment of a Palestinian man who had a heart attack during Friday prayers at Al Aqsa Mosque. </p> <p>And then there's the madness. Gaydamak has always been known for his sharp tongue \u2013 he once described Olmert as 'stupid' \u2013 but he outdid himself last month when he declared his opinion on whether the annual Jerusalem Gay Pride march, which has become a pivotal cause for the religious right in the city, would go ahead on his watch. \"They want to be proud? They're allowed to. They want to demonstrate? Fine,\" he stated at a press conference. \"But the streets of Jerusalem are a symbol, and parading on them would be an aggressive act against our tradition, against our values and against our morale. I would lie on the ground in order to block the march and would even die before I approve the pride parade in the city.\"</p> <p>Of course, this can all be explained by political expediency. The ownership of Beitar, or at least being a staunch fan, has been seen in the past as, if not a gateway into politics, then certainly a way of courting a sizeable chunk of Likud-leaning voters for everyone from Netanyahu to Olmert. Aligning the religious right on both sides of Jerusalem is also a clever way of finding common ground between two seemingly paradoxical constituencies: the sanctity of Jerusalem as a religious totem for Jews, Muslims and Christians, where issues like gay pride marches would have both Imams and Rabbis spluttering into their dainty cups of mint tea. </p> <p>Already he has sought counsel from the Mufti of Jerusalem and the Vatican. The desire to give the outgoing prime minister Olmert, one of the most unpopular politicians in Israel's history, a bloody nose and appear to be a safe pair of hands in times of crisis is self-explanatory. Whether this is enough for Gaydamak to persuade a majority of Jerusalemites to vote for him is probably unlikely. Despite currently polling third, and some reports from Israel suggest he may even be looking for a way out rather than face the prospect of finishing last, his camp maintain that their man can spring a surprise by concentrating on his right-wing religious core. The problem is that as the elections near, more unflattering reports emerge. Suddenly the Israeli Abramovich's pockets don't seem so deep anymore. </p> <p>\"When he did his business in Russia and Angola he didn't have to declare how he did it [made his fortune],\" Adar explained. \"But as soon as he bought Israeli companies he had to announce it at the stock exchange. It turns out he is a worse businessman than me! Arkadi is not doing well in the past year.\" </p> <p>Even his formally loyal Beitar fans that used to fill the Teddy Stadium with choruses of 'Arkadi is the Messiah' have started to desert him. This season has so far been a shambles. With two points docked for bad behaviour and the team knocked out of Champions League qualification after an embarrassing 5-0 capitulation to Wislaw Krakow, the side drew 0-0 with arch-rivals Bnei Sakhnin in the opening game of the season. Arkadi responded by sacking not only the manager, but also almost all of the non-playing staff, even the press spokesman. </p> <p>But the turning point was the next game, another 0-0 draw with the equally despised Maccabi Tel Aviv. \"Beitar got a penalty in the 90th minute,\" recalled Adar. \"[Shimon] Gershon took it and missed and on TV you could see him [Arkadi] shouting in Russian 'Why Gershon, why?' And after that he said [in a press conference] 'Why does the coach not get rid of Gershon?' That is when the penny dropped [with Beitar fans] that he is not very good at being in charge of a football club.\"</p> <p>Still, the big prize is the mayoralty of Jerusalem, one of Israel's, if not the Middle East's, most important jobs. It's hard to think of a more divided city, split as it is religiously, culturally and politically. It's a tense place, made tenser by the spate of Palestinian ram raids which seem to have replaced the suicide bomb as the last-resort weapon of choice, where one wrong move can ignite latent hatreds. The mayor has powers over boundaries and building permits, both politically explosive issues for the Palestinians in East Jerusalem who feel they are being slowly 'built out' of their neighbourhoods to skew the demographics in favour of the city's Jewish population. It takes a deft hand, one which many feel he just doesn't have. For evidence, look no further than the goings-on at Beitar this season. </p> <p>\"In three years he has sacked six coaches, fired the entire top-level management team and replaced the third chairman in three years with the club's former goalkeeper Itzik Korenfein,\" explained Jeremy Last, sports editor at the Jerusalem Post. \"His charitable work could be seen as showing that he cares about the Israeli people but it is also an indication of his political attitude. A year ago he admitted in a television documentary on him that he hoped people would support him politically because of the charitable work he has done. The majority of Jerusalemites do not want a mayor who will go on a sacking spree the minute things go wrong. Besides the concerns about his management style, Gaydamak quite clearly has no political experience.\" </p> <p>But the biggest barrier of all may be the fact that Gaydamak will quite literally not be truly able to understand his coveted constituency. \"He barely speaks any Hebrew, a fact which creates a barrier between himself and both his co-workers and his voters,\" Last continued. \"He insists the language barrier is not an issue, but it is hard to imagine how he will be able to sit in city council meetings when he won't be able to understand what is being said.\" November 11 will see whether his philanthropy and wrapping himself in the black and gold of Beitar will pay off. If it doesn't Arkadi will no doubt be looking for a new challenge in pastures new. I hear there's a decent, mid-sized Premier League team for sale on the south coast. Yours, Arkadi, for just \u00a360m.</p> <p><em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/When-Friday-Comes-Football-Zone/dp/1845963695\">When Friday Comes: Football in the War Zone</a> (Mainstream/Random House) by James Montague is out now</em></p>",
  "<p>At a <a href=\"http://www.progressonline.org.uk/\">Progress</a> fringe meeting this week, Labour delegates in Manchester examined the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/london08\">London elections last May</a> with a mixture of pain and pleasure. The pain was of course in the loss of the mayoralty, and the resulting self-criticism of the language, tactics and apparent deafness to the concerns of many white and outer London voters. The pleasure was in the gain of an assembly seat, and in what was generally acclaimed as a professionally organised campaign that had got activists enthusiastic in a way that is unusual in Labour politics (and contrasted with the paralysis of the will that prevails this week in Manchester).</p> <p>As well as the surface politics of the London elections, there were some intriguing fragments of information in which deeper currents could be glimpsed, provided by Ben Page of the polling organisation Ipsos-Mori. These left me thinking as much about the Conservatives as Labour. </p> <p>Ipsos-Mori's research on local government suggest that levels of \"unhappiness\" \u2013 fear of crime, dissatisfaction with local services and the council's record, and a perception of dirt and squalor \u2013 are highest in the outer London boroughs, with Croydon and Harrow leading the way. People in inner London seem by contrast relatively happy with their lot. </p> <p>As early as 2002, the Conservatives under Iain Duncan Smith did relatively well in some outer London boroughs, regaining Barnet, Redbridge and Enfield. Their campaign in these boroughs tapped into a sense that the areas were in decline, becoming more inner city and chaotic. It would be inaccurate to see this merely as a coded appeal to racism, although no doubt susceptible voters did hear a dog-whistle. The main aim was more about tapping into a sense of a lost dream among London suburban voters of a clean, green place with families living in large houses, good public services and a sense of (perhaps stifling) social order. In voting Conservative in local elections in 2002 and 2006, and in such numbers for Boris Johnson in 2008, suburbanites (including the working class suburbanites of Dagenham, and other outer London council-built areas) are saying that they do not like the current state of their suburbs very much, and haven't felt that Labour cares very much about it.</p> <p>While many suburban voters feel that they are losing what they initially found attractive in their communities, inner Londoners have often made a conscious choice to come to a place that fits their aspirations. This applies to the people who have come from all over the world to live and work in London, and for instance to the affluent inhabitants of Camden Town or Islington who prefer urban life to the calm of the suburbs. This in turn displaces people who would like to live in inner London, but cannot afford it (recent immigrants and the young) further out to cheaper suburban areas. Population turnover is so high in the inner city that people, to some extent, are sorted into places that suit them. The same is not true of the suburbs, where older established voters (including those who moved there as recently as the 1990s) have seen their areas change before their eyes. In Bexley and Bromley, which turned in a massive vote for Johnson in 2008, there has been anxiety about ending up like Croydon or Lewisham. </p> <p>Urban politics in a city on the scale of London messy and complicated. The task of maintaining a complicated rainbow coalition of competing interests without alienating any of them, or indeed arousing too much reaction from the white working and middle classes, is a tricky job to pull off, and the strains were clearly showing in Ken Livingstone's second term with rows over the London Development Agency's policies, Lee Jasper and Yusuf al-Qaradawi among others. London is, after all, still majority white and majority suburban, and assembling a winning vote for Labour on this basis is tricky. Livingstone and the Labour Assembly group pioneered some interesting new political approaches \u2013 in the first term, with Livingstone governing as an Independent, and in the second term with the City Hall alliance of Labour and Green facilitated by the proportional electoral system. Labour needs some new political skills \u2013 an inclusive, coalition-building approach and the ditching of old ambitions of monolithic control \u2013 to manage it.</p> <p>There is no long term future for the Conservatives in a politics of suburban backlash. Little can be done about the broad trends, and by winning local elections a party becomes part of the perceived problem rather than part of the solution. The Conservatives now control most suburban boroughs, and in 2006 there was a swing to Labour in Enfield and a mediocre result in Barnet \u2013 four years of Tory control had not slowed the rate of change much. The Conservatives run Croydon, Merton and Harrow after the 2006 elections and it would not be surprising if they underperform in 2010.</p> <p>But there is an alternative. The Republicans have won every New York mayoral election since 1993 with a formula of fiscal discipline, tough language (and achievement) on reducing crime, efficiency and social tolerance, and to some extent this has been a winning Conservative formula in the inner London boroughs like Westminster, Wandsworth and Kensington &amp; Chelsea which they control. But New York remains a very left-wing city in all other elections from president to borough council, and the fact remains that there is huge tension between what is needed to win in New York and the nature of the wider Republican Party. <a href=\"http://www.nyc.gov/portal/site/nycgov/menuitem.beb0d8fdaa9e1607a62fa24601c789a0/\">Michael Bloomberg</a>, after all, was always a pretty nominal Republican and went independent in 2007. Perhaps there is something structural, as well as personal, in the speculation about a rift between Johnson and Cameron, but these are early days and it may take Tory control at both national and London level to reveal the potential for division.</p>",

  "<h2>Flexible working review</h2> <p>Flexible working is on the agenda once again, as the government spent part of August launching a consultation into extending the idea. The consultation, which lasts until November 18, will seek input on whether current legislation should be changed. At present, if an employee has a child under six years old or a disabled child under 18 they may ask to be considered for flexible working; the proposal is that this should be extended to include parents of older children.</p> <p>The legislation in its current form has been subject to criticism: many studies have suggested that the flexible working ethic has been observed by management and not the workforce. The flaw often cited is that companies that can't be bothered to offer flexible working can easily find a loophole. Asking to be considered for flexible working can always be met with \"we've considered it and decided it's inappropriate\". While this decision might be for good reasons, it's an easy get-out clause.

A new government paper says much the same thing, but where is the practical help? It's with this in mind that manufacturer Energenie has started pitching its Standby Shutdown product (pictured, right) into businesses as well as into domestic settings. The idea is that if a product is left on standby for longer than two minutes \u2014 using possibly 70% of the power it would take up under normal circumstances, according to Energenie \u2014 then Standby Shutdown device switches it off. The concept is flawed in a business context, of course: a computer set to back up overnight won't do so if someone has cut the juice off. Nevertheless, it should help save some power. All the company has to do now is persuade business owners it's worth buying a product marked \"Great for kids' rooms\" on the packaging.

Jeremy Starling, managing director of Involve, advocates clear direction \u2014 telling the workforce where the company is going and why \u2014 and trying to involve them in how this eventually happens. Communication should be kept open: \"The rumour mill will fill any vacuum. The more information you provide to your employees, the less impact rumours, exaggerations and myths will have on staff morale,\" he says. \"I recommend creating a regular voluntary forum where staff can get together and ask management difficult questions face to face, as well as vent their feelings.\" Other elements he recommends include honesty and remembering to thank remaining staff when something goes right.</p> <h2>Google Video</h2> <p>Following its 10th birthday in early September, Google continues to dominate the online world \u2014 this time through Google Video for Business.

  "<p>Not before time, \"green\" industry has recognised that if you equate environmental friendliness with the ability to save a lot of money, businesses suddenly become much keener. Bolstering the company brand and impressing customers, while also having a board-pleasing impact on the bottom line, is a winning formula.</p> <p>British businesses fritter away close to \u00a37m a day, according to the Carbon Trust. Combining such statistics with its own findings, utility company E.ON, which is currently running a campaign to change employee behaviour in small businesses, estimates that an average office wastes \u00a36,000 a year and 3.36 tonnes of carbon dioxide through sloppy practices. </p> <p>E.ON has found the biggest problem is changing the company mindset when it comes to being more frugal. Almost 80% of workers admit to failing to transfer good practice at home to the office. Worse still, almost two-thirds currently ignore company policy on environmental initiatives, a trend especially pronounced among SMEs.</p> <h2>Waste awareness</h2> <p>\"At home, consumers seem to be more aware of wastage and will make a greater effort to switch off a light, turn off a dripping tap or recycle, but in the office this consciousness is less pronounced,\" says Roger Papworth, programme delivery manager at sustainable business consultancy Envirowise. People feel less accountable and less visible at work, plus they're not paying for the services.</p> <p>Businesses are now more cash-strapped than ever and energy costs continue to soar. If employee apathy is to be overcome, green initiatives must be driven from the top. A costings wake-up call spurs even the smallest enterprise into action.</p> <p>Typically, energy constitutes the second biggest business expense after staff salaries. Simple measures such as turning down the heating or the air conditioning by just one or two degrees can save 6%\u20138% on a company's overall energy costs. Be more selective in use of office lighting and that's another 10% saving. \"If a business is spending \u00a3500,000 a year on energy consumption, a 20% reduction in power use adds up to a \u00a3100,000 saving,\" says Tom Fidell, an energy conservation engineer at energyteam, which specialises in advising businesses in this area.</p> <p>Happily, the biggest savings can be achieved for free or very little. The key to change is educating and motivating employees to cut down on their energy wastage \u2014 encouraging them to switch off lights, for example. </p> <p>\"Heating should not need to be set above 19 degrees, nor air conditioning below 24 degrees,\" Fidell says. \"It is absurd that people have to wear jumpers at work in the summer because the office has been overcooled. What happened to adapting to the seasons?\"</p> <p>When it comes to lighting, companies may need to invest a small amount in new controls that allow the system to be \"zoned\" so that those sitting near the windows can switch off, or so individuals or small teams working late don't incur the costs of lighting the entire floor. \"Its just good housekeeping, but it can make a substantial difference,\" Fidell says. For additional savings, when lighting is replaced, go for small-diameter, high-frequency fluorescent tubes. Other well-documented responsible work practices include replacing old electronic equipment with Energy Star-rated devices and turning off machines that aren't in use. </p> <p>\"One of the quickest, cheapest and easiest fixes to power wastage is having the ability to regulate when machines are on and off,\" says Francis West, CEO at FWCS, a supplier of green money-saving IT solutions for small businesses. \"It's a myth that switching a device off and on uses more power,\" he says, pointing to recent research conducted for Fujitsu-Siemens, which shows that if a PC is switched off at 6pm or 7pm then on again at 8am a company could save \u00a3100 a year per PC, compared to leaving the systems on standby. \"And that was before recent increases in energy costs,\" West notes.</p> <p>\"For an organisation with 120 machines that's a saving of \u00a312,000 a year, equating to 53 new machines, new training, or a staff holiday \u2014 however you want to position it,\" he says. </p> <p>A rack of three servers draws the same power as 20 average households. Generating a lot of heat, these high-performing processors need to be cooled. While some servers, such as those running email, may need to stay on around the clock, this may not be the case for all of them. </p> <h2>Cost management</h2> <p>If businesses want to reduce energy costs further, they can also investigate switching supplier (see surviving recession, page 5, for advice on this). This won't make them greener, but it will continue to drive energy management in the right direction. Market analyst Datamonitor estimates that while energy suppliers may lose money on new business customers in the first year, by offering them great deals to encourage them to switch, they make 32% profit from them in the next by moving their rates. \"Only a small proportion of SMEs have ever switched energy supplier and we estimate that UK SMEs are overpaying by \u00a32bn each year,\" says Jonathan Elliott, MD of Make It Cheaper, a price comparison and switching service for SMEs. </p> <p>For FWCS's West, who practises green behaviour across his own business, it isn't just cost that drives his zeal for reducing wastage. His epiphany came when he saw Al Gore's documentary on global warming, An Inconvenient Truth. \"It rocked me to my foundation. You can't watch the film without getting a profound sense of our individual responsibility for preserving the planet for our children's children,\" he says.</p> <p>Being seen to be green is another important driver in changing businesses' behaviour. From legal firms to shops and hotels, organisations are keen to demonstrate their own social responsibility because it helps strengthen their brand. If their customers include public sector organisations or large businesses, the ability to demonstrate green credentials could be crucial to their ability to maintain key relationships, as these clients strive to meet their own sustainability targets.</p> <p>Tightening legislation is also heaping on the pressure to save the planet from within the workplace. By 2010, any business with an energy spend of \u00a3500,000 a year will have to participate in the government's compulsory carbon trading scheme, while the new energy performance certificates (EPCs) coming into effect this October will affect businesses of all sizes. Firms will face fines of up to \u00a35,000 if they fail to present a valid EPC when building, selling, leasing or modifying their premises. </p> <p>And from January, air-conditioning systems using 250kW and above will need to be surveyed. \"All of this helps drive awareness and focus the mind,\" says energyteam's Fidell. </p> <p>Without that awareness, change is hard to effect.</p>",
  "<p>It now seems like a different era, but way back in April, at the Russian resort town of Sochi, George Bush and Vladimir Putin issued a <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/04/20080406-4.html\">US-Russia strategic declaration</a> that outlined an impressive agenda of bilateral cooperation on key strategic issues. At the top of the list was negotiating a legally binding post-<a href=\"http://www.fas.org/nuke/control/start1/index.html\">Start</a> arrangement.<br> Start is the cornerstone arms control agreement between the US and Russia, and it <a href=\"http://www.armscontrol.org/pressroom/2008/20080512_START_Anew\">will expire in December 2009</a>. Concluded in 1991 during the final days of the cold war, it set ceilings on nuclear forces and laid out an elaborate set of mechanisms for verifying mutual compliance, setting new standards for nuclear transparency. Start is also important because the 2002 Moscow Treaty (also known as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SORT\">Sort</a>), which specifies further reductions, incorporates its verification measures.<br> There is now a very real risk that when Start expires there will be no successor agreement to replace it, with potentially grave implications for nuclear security. The Bush administration has indefinitely postponed a trip to Russia by its top arms control official to discuss Start, and Russia seems to welcome the silent treatment. For Russia, the problem is <a href=\"http://www.tnr.com/politics/story.html?id=c7ce0977-817a-425f-b82b-6a8f2caa0587\">nationalism</a>. The Sochi declaration said that the parties \"reject the zero-sum thinking of the cold war when what was good for Russia was bad for America and vice versa.\" This eminently rational principle belies the raw nationalism and paranoia that are now driving much of Russia's foreign policy, including its strenuous objections to Nato expansion and missile defence installations in Europe. As <a href=\"http://news.google.co.uk/news/url?sa=t&amp;ct=:ePkh8BM9EwLbwQq0w4ANYgubEFNqjgEr3LZUuJW5MIuMBGYEO1-cw6VxNfLir84KK517v9iAmgDP6RGe/13-0&amp;fp=48d90d0619695abd&amp;ei=U1HZSO_bC6LsQ6e5taIE&amp;url=http%3A//www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2008/09/18/ST2008091803570.html&amp;cid=1247442866&amp;usg=AFQjCNHHjxjAokdJrxdBi729wc7vn02-NA\">Condoleezza Rice noted in her speech on Russia</a> last week, Moscow is still hung up on the cold war - or more precisely, the humiliating manner in which it ended. Russia had to endure nearly a decade of economic and strategic impotence as its one-time rival emerged as a lone economic and military superpower. There are vast segments of Russian society who believe that the US achieved at least some of these advances at Russia's direct expense.<br> There is some truth to this, but only if you believe - as Putin and other Russian elites apparently do - that Russia's strength lies primarily in its ability to exert hegemony over its periphery. There is a pronounced zero-sum character to this that makes cooperation and compromise extraordinarily difficult. Paraphrasing Bush: \"you are either with us, or you are with the Americans.\" The irony, of course, is that this false dichotomy generates precisely the kind of insecurities that push countries like Georgia straight into Nato's arms - which, in turn, only amplifies Moscow's sense of grievance. There is only so much the US can do about Russian nationalism. Washington and its Nato allies must stand firm against Russian aggression, and they certainly can't give Russia a unilateral veto over which countries join Nato or whether Nato countries build a technologically flawed ballistic missile defence system. But it is ridiculous for the Bush administration to think that it can \"punish\" Moscow by refusing to talk to it about enduring strategic interests in nuclear transparency. This neoconservative canard about not talking to countries you don't like backfired with North Korea, has failed so far with Iran and will not promote US security objectives with Russia. Washington and Moscow were able to negotiate Start during the cold war. Surely they can muster enough good sense to negotiate a successor agreement more than 15 years after the cold war ended.</p>",
  "<p>When market conditions are tough, the instinct is to rein in spending. Even if strategic investment is preserved, this is a time when many companies will reassess their cost base and shop around on price.</p> <p>How prudent a strategy is this? As the supply-demand balance tips, the power shifts to the customer, who may now expect more for less. If all is not stable at the supply side, the firm could find itself in trouble.</p> <p>It's tempting for businesses to put pressure on their own suppliers, to regain control of their cost bases and protect margins, but in an unsteady climate this could be unwise, jeopardising hard-won relationships with core vendors and service providers on which your business depends. The chances are that you need them more than they need you, and if you squeeze them too hard on price they'll walk away, downgrade your service or, in the worst-case scenario, go bust.</p> <p>\"I'm a great believer that you should never simply look at the headline price when re-evaluating your cost base,\" says Craig Neame, a partner at law firm Holman Fenwick Willan. Neame is a former logistics business consultant specialising in collaborative, risk-reward-based partnerships between businesses and their suppliers \u2014 relationships that run much deeper than surface cost.</p> <p>\"In the logistics business, companies will immediately look at freight costs when reassessing where they could make savings,\" he says. \"This is because it's a metric that's easily measurable, but I'd be looking beyond this to what's creating the need for freight and whether changes here could reduce costs on a broader scale.\"</p> <p>This might mean reviewing the mix of ocean and air freight, the frequency of deliveries, or the level of inventory being held. \"The point is that there are other ways to cut costs,\" he says. If you've got 20 suppliers for a product line, this will generate 20 invoices and perhaps 100 line items, he explains. Fewer accounts could mean better discounts and less administration for the finance department. Meanwhile, moving to electronic invoicing allows automatic invoice matching. All of this can help bring internal costs down without messing suppliers around.</p> <p>The larger the supplier, the less likely they are to kowtow to a small customer. Far better to attempt to nurture these relationships for additional benefits that might be available, Neame suggests. \"While it's harder for smaller firms to devote the management time to this, if you have the spirit of cooperation you may be amazed by the solutions your suppliers can come up with if you give them the chance,\" he says.</p> <p>\"There is a temptation to want to keep your business challenges private, fearing that you may lose ground if you own up to any problems, but in my experience it's astonishing what can be achieved if you're prepared to lay out your business model.\"</p> <p>While a large supplier may not view a small business as a core customer, the customer relationship manager will be keen to maintain a range of accounts, to minimise the Pareto factor \u2014 where 80% of the company's business relies on 20% of customers \u2014 and spread their risk, especially with a recession on the cards. It will be a priority to keep your business, so they should be only too glad to help come up with creative solutions. </p> <p>\"In manufacturing and distribution, if you're making a 5% profit margin on a turnover of \u00a31 million you're taking away \u00a350,000,\" Neame notes. \"To generate the same again you'd have to sell \u00a31 million of more products, but if you can save 5% of your costs you've made a million right there. The ideal is to work with your suppliers to do this without hurting their own margins.\"</p> <p>A great advocator of nurturing suppliers is entrepreneur Simon Woodroffe, the former Dragon's Den panellist and founder of Yo! Sushi. He admits to agreeing to most prices without negotiation these days, on the basis that if you keep a supplier happy they'll work hard for you. \"It's in your interests that they do well, so it's important to recognise their need to make a profit too,\" he says.</p>",
  "<p>You have an interest \u2014 it's all-consuming. You think it's fascinating and there's bound to be a way of making a living out of it. You might not be Jane Asher with her famous cakes, but there's got to be some way of turning your passion into gold.</p> <p>You might not be Jane Asher but, funnily enough, Jane Asher is. She set up her cake shop in Chelsea after writing successful books on cake making and sugarcraft. \"I remember people sending me cuttings from American magazines with cakes copied exactly from my books. Which is fair enough \u2014 you write a book, they do it and sell them.\" She felt she ought to do something to capitalise on what was obviously a popular idea.</p> <p>At this point business sense had to take over from enthusiasm, and Asher, deliberately or otherwise, set herself rigid criteria on how to make it work. Any shop she owned had to be close to home, as she had no intention of giving up her day job or abandoning her family. \"I think that's probably typical of women entrepreneurs, without wanting to be sexist,\" she says. \"You develop your interest into a business for those sorts of reasons.\"</p> <h2>Straightforward borrowing</h2> <p>Asher lived in Chelsea, which is affluent, so the demographic was able to afford hand-decorated cakes. Money was unexpectedly straightforward. \"It wouldn't happen now, but I walked in and I saw a bank manager I'd known for some time. I said I wanted to start a small business, he said 'my wife loves your cake books'. I borrowed \u00a380,000 and opened the shop.\"</p> <p>Then another piece of business sense kicked in \u2014 finding a business manager. \"I knew that if it succeeded I'd still want to go back to my real job much more full-time when the children had grown up. This was the only time I went to an agency. A catering agency sent me a number of people and I remember when I interviewed Ruth Clark, who's still with me, I was in full 18th-century dress at the National!\"</p> <p>Asher's inexperience showed early on: \"We underpriced drastically,\" she explains. \"I took a stab at what a cake should cost without any sort of system. I then decided we had to take X amount an hour for staff, rent, rates or whatever \u2014 eventually we worked it out. Initially it was very hard to judge how long a cake would take to make.\" She also spent too much. \"I was persuaded into a lot of <br>marketing I needn't have done. I didn't think it was necessary, but designers are very good at persuading you that these things are.\"</p> <p>Asher admits that having a well-known name was invaluable, but not everybody has that advantage. Claire Novis started belly dancing classes after reading an article on holiday. Eventually things moved on and she was asked to stand in for a tutor and later qualified to teach herself. Starting up required a whole new set of skills and knowledge. </p> <p>\"I was determined that if I was going to do this, I was going to be as professional as possible in the service I offered, and therefore wanted to be legitimate in what I was doing,\" Novis says. \"But what do you need to do to make sure you're abiding by all the rules, insurance and tax requirements?\" She recommends a visit to the HMRC website (hmrc.gov.uk) as a good starting point.</p> <p>Marketing has become easier through her website (clairedances.co.uk). She runs the business alongside her full-time job as a senior geologist. \"On opening my car boot you're often, therefore, confronted by the rather confusing view of half of it being filled with hard hats, high visibility jackets and steel toe-capped boots, with the other half being filled with hip belts, chiffon and sequins.\"</p> <p>Mark Lee, independent business adviser and founder of the Tax Advice Network, was advised to become a children's entertainer early in life. He decided against it because of the hours professionals work. </p> <p>\"My wife is avoiding this trap by keeping her card-making activities as a hobby,\" Lee says. \"She loves making cards for friends and family birthdays, anniversaries and special occasions. This is a labour-intensive activity. She doesn't want the pressure of having to make hundreds at a time and we also know that the income she could make would not justify the time and effort, even if the cards all sold quickly.\"</p> <p>There's also the problem of detachment, he adds. \"Many people make that mistake and assume that their passion will be sufficient. Market research \u2014 beyond asking friends and family, who will be biased, is critical. And then you have to be prepared to adapt your business model to reflect what the marketplace wants.\"</p> <p>Author Emma Jones heads up the Enterprise Nation website and agrees that it's easier to spot a gap in the market than to \"make sure there's a market in that gap.\" She urges people to check how many customers and competitors \u2014 with whom it might be easier to cooperate than compete \u2014 there are. Above all, look at the commercial reality of a venture. \"Look at what others are charging and the price you think customers will pay,\" she says. \"Then work out if this figure, multiplied by a conservative estimate of customer numbers, is enough to get the business up and running and keep it afloat.\" </p> <p>After mastering sales, marketing. cashflow, employer skills and tax affairs, readers will be relieved to hear it goes from impossible to just pretty difficult. It can work spectacularly. Jane Asher isn't the only one to turn a profit, but without sensible help and some objectivity she may not have succeeded.</p>",
  "<p>Small, cheap notebook computers are rapidly becoming the latest craze, because they are light, portable and incredibly handy to have around. My dentist has just asked me which one to buy, and my friend the driving instructor is already using an Asus Eee PC for roadside surfing via a mobile phone dongle. They're springing up all over.</p> <p>Taiwan's Asus got the market started a year ago, and more than a dozen suppliers have now piled in. Examples include Acer's Aspire One, Hewlett-Packard's Mini-Note 2133, MSI's Wind/Advent 4211 and Samsung's NC10. Dell has just started shipping the Inspiron Mini 9, and Lenovo, which makes IBM ThinkPads, has one on the way.</p> <p>So far we have not settled on a name, but they are called subnotebooks, netbooks, mini-books, and liliputers. Intel calls them MIDs (mobile internet devices). Microsoft calls them ULCPCs (ultra low-cost personal computers) and targets them with a cheap version of Windows XP.</p> <p>We've had subnotebook computers for years, but sales didn't take off. Most were aimed at travelling businessmen or \"road warriors\" and prices often ranged between \u00a31,500 and \u00a32,500. Unless you really needed portability, you could buy a faster machine with a bigger screen for less.</p> <p>Netbooks have small keyboards and screens \u2014 between 18 and 26cm (seven and 10.2 inches), low-power processors, and may have no conventional drives at all: often they use Flash memory. They are small enough to fit in a manbag or handbag and only cost around \u00a3200-\u00a3300; they're almost an impulse buy. Gartner researchers reckon about 5m units will be sold this year, increasing to 8m next year. I think those are conservative numbers.</p> <p>Originally, netbooks were intended for schools, following the model of the OLPC (one laptop per child) project, and the competing Intel Classmate PC design. The Asus Eee PC 700 was launched in the UK by RM, a specialist schools IT supplier, but soon it seemed we all wanted one.</p> <p>Andee Hsu, European product manager for the Eee PC, says Asus designed the machine for families: \"You, me, the kids \u2014 everyone can have their own. We were able to reach customers we haven't reached before. Later, we also found out it was very good for business trips, and people were buying them as second PCs.</p> <h2>Easy to use</h2> <p>\"We also found that the seven-inch screen was a little too small for senior people, so now we have launched a 10-inch model with a bigger keyboard and a bigger screen,\" Hsu adds. \"Physically it's not much bigger and, as a senior person myself, I've found it far easier to use.\"</p> <p>Dell is also targeting its new \u00a3299 Inspiron Mini 9 at consumers who want to use it for blogging, emails, watching BBC iPlayer and YouTube videos, and video-chat. Dell's European consumer product manager Adam Griffin says it's not aimed at business users. \"There's a clear differentiation between that and a value laptop that has a bigger screen, a lot more power, performance and hard drive space.\" (Dell's value notebook line, called Vostro, starts at a lower price than the Mini 9 netbook.)</p> <p>While it may not be a replacement for a full-spec portable, a netbook can still earn its keep. You can use one for email while travelling, where a bigger PC would be unwieldy. You can also browse the web at Wi-Fi hotspots. Although instant messaging, social networking (for example, Facebook) and blogging are seen as consumer applications, more and more businesses are using them.</p> <h2>Online applications</h2> <p>It's true that the Intel Atom \u2014 a tiny new processor designed for the MID market \u2014 does not have the raw power of a Celeron, Pentium or Core processor for running desktop applications, but many netbook owners use online applications instead. Gmail and Google Docs are obvious choices, but there are plenty more.</p> <p>Browser-based online applications are particularly important for people who have devices that don't run Windows, whether they're netbooks or mobile phones. Netbooks tend to offer a choice of either Windows XP (the HP 2133 runs Vista) or a variant of Linux. Although Linux has a reputation for being hard to use, netbooks come with simple front ends that make it very easy to run the built-in applications. However, it can be hard for non-geeks to replace or add to these, as I've found.</p> <p>Usually, the preinstalled Linux applications are free, open-source programs such as the Firefox web browser, Thunderbird email client, and OpenOffice suite. All these are available for Windows, too. However, programs such as Microsoft Office and Apple's iTunes are not available for Linux. If you need to run a particular application, or connect to another device such as a printer or a mobile phone dongle, check this is possible \u2014 or there's a substitute \u2014 before buying.</p> <p>Asus started out selling a Linux version of the Eee PC but now also offers Windows XP. Hsu says the initial response was that \"Linux is very complicated. Right now, with the second-PC customer, we find they adopt Windows better.\" It seems people tend to buy what they know.</p> <p>So, are netbooks good for business? It depends how you work. If you travel around, you might find you can get things done at times and in places where you would otherwise be unable to work. If so, a netbook can pay for itself in days.</p> <p>In my experience, netbooks are even more useful if you have a mobile broadband connection, not just Wi-Fi. It's no surprise that Vodafone plans to sell Dell Mini 9 netbooks with built-in mobile broadband in Vodafone stores. If you're a \"digital nomad\", a netbook is more portable than a business notebook PC but more functional than a BlackBerry or similar smartphone. You may find it's just what you need.</p>",

  "<p>In September last year, Deloitte, one of the world's largest accountancy firms, decided to try out a new way of attracting bright college kids to its graduate programme. Rather than spend millions on an advertising campaign or develop a complicated public relations strategy, Deloitte did something else: it turned to existing staff, supplied them with digital camcorders and invited them to make short films about their job.</p> <p>Now, it's a widely held belief that accountancy is not the most creative of professions. You would be forgiven for thinking that a film festival comprised entirely of the work of accountants would be possibly the most boring cultural event of all time. Surprisingly, the inaugural Deloitte Film Festival defies such stereotyping. </p> <p>Far from the snore-fest you might expect, Deloitte's employees showed that, not only do many possess admirable technical skills, but many are capable of great bounds of wit and self-deprecating humour. So much so that it could give a whole new meaning to the phrase creative accountancy.</p> <p>Charged with the brief, \"What's Your Deloitte,\" employees were encouraged to make short films expressing the organisation's culture and values. More than 370 short films were produced and placed on the corporation's intranet, where fellow employees were invited to rate each submission. Many of the best were eventually uploaded to YouTube. </p> <h2>Collaboration and inclusion</h2> <p>Cathy Benko, chief talent officer at Deloitte, said the festival offered a \"fresh approach to recruitment and retention\" at the company, and that would help to provide prospective candidates with a \"true look\" into life at Deloitte. She adds: \"The initiative also fostered a sense of collaboration and inclusion and provided an excellent tool for bridging the generational gap that exists in corporate culture today.\"</p> <p>What is perhaps even more surprising about Deloitte's foray into film production is that employees were not just encouraged to speak the language of college kids, but they could say exactly what they liked. They were told that the whole initiative would be unfettered by senior management: no rules and no censorship. A position, perhaps, that would have been unthinkable a decade ago.</p> <p>This type of corporate film festival is an example of what experts are calling employee-generated content. Most web users are now familiar with user-generated content, the catch-all term that describes material written and produced by members of the public, which includes everything from Wikipedia pages to Trip Advisor hotel reviews to Facebook profiles. In theoretical terms, user-generated content is a form of social media, which in turn is categorised by the way users in a network share content they have created themselves, rather than merely consume that created by a professional elite of media producers.</p> <p>User-generated content and social media have their roots on the internet, but now the business world is growing the potential and starting to deploy something similar within their operations.</p> <p>As you might expect, IT companies are leading the way. Intel has long encouraged its employees to write their own blogs, for example, and eBay has also screened a film festival. IBM encourages its 320,000 employees to produce internal podcasts. IBM even goes so far as to offer a \"podcast in a box\" \u2014 a full set of recording gear \u2014 to those most keen. For example, staff at the company's research lab in Hursley, near Winchester, use the service to spread the word about the work of the lab's researchers as well as the routines of workers with unusual job responsibilities. </p> <p>The electronics behemoth is claiming that the policy has not only led to more effective internal communication, it has also reduced the collective phone bill.<br>\"Employee-generated content finally delivers on the promise of two-way communication,\" says Lee Smith, an analyst at internal communications specialists the Gatehouse Consultancy. \"It is a very democratic tool that many companies are embracing as a way of engaging with their employees, while marking a shift away from the command-and-control approach of the past.\"</p> <h2>Tricky path</h2> <p>According to Smith, many companies are abandoning the old top-down structure \u2014 official memos written by senior management, typed up by personal assistants and sent down the chain of command to be obeyed by subordinates \u2014 in favour of far more democratic alternatives. </p> <p>The big challenge for organisations is how do they make such a transformation without relinquishing control? \"The path towards corporate transparency is a tricky one,\" concedes Smith. \"There are many examples where employees have used social media to blow the whistle on their boss, or have simply just embarrassed the company,\" he says, citing the example of supermarket chain Somerfield, whose employees were caught on YouTube mucking about with the shopping trollies after hours.</p> <p>Here, perhaps, is a lesson: unless corporations open up to the potential of social media their employees will do so anyway, and they will do so without any safeguards or control. Already in the US, sites including Jobvent.com allow disgruntled employees to rate \u2014 and potentially break \u2014 the reputations of the companies they work for. </p> <p>UK site Blagger.com allows people to post opinions about companies they either work for, or use regularly, but there's also perhaps an even greater need for companies to embrace social media: namely that their future employees will demand it. The Deloitte Film Festival was engineered primarily to attract young talent to the company and it was done in a medium that the young already subscribe to. \"Younger employees see it as a way of life,\" explains Smith. \"They are on Facebook day in, day out. Employers have to respond to that.\"</p> <p>One large company doing just that is BT. Rather than ban Facebook-style communication at work, the recently deployed a similar kind of social network for all of its 104,000 employees. Its new service, called My BT, features status updates (similar to Twitter.com), networks of colleagues (similar to Facebook's network of friends) and social bookmarking (similar to the shared bookmarks on sites like Del.icio.us). My BT adds to the whole suite of employee-generated content \u2014 blogs, wikis and podcasts \u2014 already offered.</p> <p>BT's grasp of employee-generated content isn't just about keeping workers happy, it offers up the promise of a new way of doing business. \"By its very nature, one of the underlying principles of social media is that it is self-organising,\" explains Richard Dennison, senior manager of social media at BT. \"That's really challenging for people, especially those at the top.\" </p> <p>Dennison cites the way many of its employees use My BT to create ad hoc groups across the organisation. \"We base this around skills and interests,\" he explains. \"If you start typing in a skill, let's say Java programming, other people with that skill appear in a drop-down menu. What it effectively does is connect me with everyone else in the organisation that has put down that skill.\"</p> <h2>Mutual benefit</h2> <p>This offers a clear benefit to those lower down the organisational structure who are able to get things done by creating personal networks, rather than always waiting to be told what to do. Moreover, those higher up can also benefit from a means of operation that is much more fluid.</p> <p>One of the busiest areas on the BT corporate intranet is the internal newsdesk. It used to embody everything about old-school communication: it was tightly controlled by the BT's communications department. \"What tends to happen is that the communications team controls everything in that space,\" says Dennison. \"As a recipient in that space you just like it or lump it.\" </p> <p>Now BT has introduced an employee-generated section called Your Space, inviting employees to feed back views and potential concerns. \"It's increasingly useful,\" says Dennison. \"It's our second highest profile site of the intranet and gets millions of hits a week.\" What is most interesting, he says, is the way in which some \"very senior\" management have engaged with the initiative. \"They've engaged as punters, rather than throw their weight around.\"</p> <p>Employee-generated content might be challenging those at the top, but perhaps only so those who refuse to listen. The experience of Deloitte, and others, also shows that if those at the top give trust to those below, they have nothing much to fear at all.</p>",
  "<p>My postings last week, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/greenslade/2008/sep/18/uk\">A Telegraph journalist writes</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/greenslade/2008/sep/19/1\">My response to the Telegraph journalist</a>, appear to have stimulated a lively debate, both within the Telegraph office and in other newspaper newsrooms.</p> <p>It prompted the original emailer to respond, and he also gained more than a measure of support from two colleagues who wrote to me on what one called \"lobby terms\". In the circumstances, that's understandable (and their their <em>bona fides</em> check out, so I know they are genuine). </p> <p>Let's deal with the response first. He/she ('he' for ease of use) wanted to make it very clear that his complaints were not meant to be a lament for the passing of \"a non-existent golden age\", nor was it aimed at revisiting \"the tired old battle between old and new Telegraphs.\" </p> <p>Indeed, he appears to have little time for either old or new. A decade or so ago, he writes, \"it was dispiritingly complacent, inefficient and patrician. Now it's inefficient, brutal and arrogant.\"</p> <p>But what he was trying to get across is his concern that... </p> <blockquote> <p>\"...companies are using the digital revolution as an excuse/opportunity to cut costs and investment in their staff, to the point where journalism will cease to be a viable career for anyone over the age of 30.</p> <p>\"If a national paper is offering only \u00a325,000 a year for its much-trumpeted new jobs (the Telegraph's 'content editors') and expects people to work one full weekend in two (the new rotas being introduced here in conjunction with the end of the nine-day fortnight), a long-term career looks less than rewarding.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><br> He accepts <a href=\"http://www.countervalue.com/2008/09/18/more-from-those-halcyon-telegraph-days/\"><strong>Justin Williams's</strong> point</a> that journalism has never been a 9-5 job, but argues that extra hours were worked due to \"the goodwill, energy and professionalism of staff. That goodwill is now being taken away by the forced imposition of punitive new rotas.\" </p> <p>He also accepts my point about executives always having worked 70-hour weeks, but claims: \"There was also always a place for people who wanted to combine a good day's work with a normal family life, usually as a sub. That option is now disappearing.\"<br> Though he applauds the efforts of papers such as <strong>The Guardian</strong>, which have negotiated changes in working practices with staff, he writes: \"To paraphrase, comment is cheap but facts are expensive. And I don't trust many media organisations to make the investment required to uncover new facts, which I believe should be the currency of journalism, when there is so much cheaper content available to them.\"<br> His anxiety about falling pay and more arduous working conditions was echoed in the comments of many non-Telegraph journalists who contacted me, not least from the provinces. No wonder the <strong>National Union of Journalists</strong> is announcing industrial action at a variety of papers on a weekly basis. </p> <p>There was powerful backing for his arguments from a colleague in another area of the paper (she has no idea, she says, of that writer's identity). She is also worried about the effects of staff cutbacks and a changing editorial agenda, attributable in part to demands for an increasing online audience.<br> She argues that there has been a \"lamentable decline in the breadth of news covered by the Telegraph\" and believes that under the stewardship of the editor, <strong>Will Lewis</strong>, the paper \"has become superficial, uninformative and filled with content that isn't news and isn't even new - witness the repeated health page items on the virtues of the Mediterranean diet.\"</p> <p>She paints a picture of an organisation determined to generate as much content as possible as cheaply as possible to put up on to the website. \"You do realise, don't you, that stuff is being lifted with hardly a word changed from the Mail website and the Metro?\" </p> <p>In fact, I noted just a week ago that a story about a member of my own family that was originally on the Mail website appeared the next day on the Telegraph website. But it didn't dawn on me at the time that this was not a one-off, but a pattern backed by a policy decision. This is some revelation, is it not? </p> <p>As the emailer observes: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"This doesn't really seem to me to be the way forward at all. Somewhere they [the Telegraph managers and editors] seem to have forgotten, or jettisoned, the notion of publishing things that are interesting as opposed to iterative. </p> <p>\"No one is going to pay the least bit of attention to a media organisation that recirculates other people's stuff, and thus the name, the brand and the reputation are constantly undermined from within. One can even imagine a situation a few years hence when the Telegraph is no more than a news aggregator website doing no journalism of its own. </p> <p>\"We used to have a fairly simple formula, which was to pick the 150 most interesting stories of the day and publish them in a straightforward manner in the paper and online. All the mysticism, web hoopla and the rise of business journalists as the new kings of the hill seems to have obscured this.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><br> This strikes me as a very powerful criticism that Lewis and his bosses need to answer. Recycling another newspaper's material in order to provide content, which cannot produce itself (due to a lack of staff) and which is also antipathetic to the Telegraph's ethos, does seem to lead down a cul de sac. It will undermine internal morale and external loyalty.</p> <p>The second emailer, backed strongly by the third, also registered a strong complaint about the stretching of hours. Working extra time would be fine, but only if one could identify with the end result, if there was a genuine value in having added one's own value. Both subs and reporters find producing modern Telegraph journalism an increasingly alienating process.</p> <p>Back to the second emailer for a final comment that happens to encapsulate the feelings of other commenters too: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"It's true that there is a lot of moaning about 'the web' and 'citizen journalists, but no one doubts that we have to do everything better, be more savvy and work on all platforms. </p> <p>\"What astounds all of us is that the people leading us either never knew, or have forgotten, that they have to carry quality forward into a world that isn't so much coming as already here and engulfing us.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>In other words, we must not sacrifice quality as we move forward. What is striking about the views of all three emailers is that they are not railing against the web. What troubles them is the future of a journalism they obviously regard as important for our society.</p>",
  "<p>As another week in late modernity's troubled, deregulated global market begins anew, there will be many who will be hoping that governments here and in the US will continue to prop up this market, and an even greater number who will be wondering how all of this affects them. So too, there will no doubt be policy advisors \u2013 as was revealed most recently by a leaked Home Office document \u2013 trying to work out how this will affect law and order, as if to imply that rising crime inextricably follows an economic downturn.</p> <p>Some criminologists \u2013 most recently <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/richardgarside\">Richard Garside</a> \u2013 have tried to explain how difficult it is to link the underlying economic situation with crime statistics, and have rightly described how inequality \u2013 the widening gap between the \"haves\" and the \"have-nots\" \u2013 is probably the best indicator of how criminogenic a society will be. However, there has been hardly anyone at all who has pointed out the most obvious criminological reality \u2013 namely, that we should see the crime explosion of the 1990s and beyond as the direct result of the neoliberal political economy and that the crime that we are currently experiencing stems from deregulation in the service of the needs of business. In short, it is not a question of how crime might rise in these circumstances, but rather how these circumstances have already created the crimes that blight our towns and cities.</p> <p>If ever proof were needed of the impact of the move from traditional forms of capital, community and politics to a globalised economy built on unstable labour markets and consumerism then Steve Hall, Simon Winlow and Craig Ancrum's extraordinary new book \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.willanpublishing.co.uk/cgi-bin/indexer?product=9781843922551\">Criminal Identities and Consumer Culture</a> \u2013 provides more than enough evidence. The book's basis is a long-term, ethnographic study of a range of contacts in the north-east of England.</p> <p>Taking as their starting point the idea that \"smart liberals\" have not controlled capitalism's \"nasty side\", they show how an expansion of consumption through credit has created a culture obsessed with material goods, and where competitive individualism \u2013 the \"me project\" \u2013 has emptied old, solid, working-class communities of value and meaning so that these have become places to escape from, rather than fight for and improve as a collective. In such communities they argue that \"crime is an instrument for achieving fantasised positions of social distinction and 'respect' in consumer culture\", and where as a result most of their respondents wanted to become \"stars\" of a criminal underworld as a means of gaining access to the material possessions that conferred status and meaning on their lives.</p> <p>What they have produced is essentially a bleak and sobering picture, but all the better for the honesty and theoretical inventiveness that they bring to their material. So too they offer a corrective for all the current and planned interventions that are propping up a market based on the fictitious world of finance capital, and which has created a \"post-needs, desire-driven\" society that has obliterated economic and social significance for vast swaths of our population, and left in its wake more crime than we have probably ever experienced in our history.</p>",
  "<p>Mark Kleiman has some interesting responses to the McCain campaign's attempt to use the entire city of Chicago and state of Illinois as fodder against Obama.</p> <p>Go read <a href=\"http://www.samefacts.com/archives/john_mccain_/2008/09/hardball.php\">the post</a>, which includes what Kleiman says is the mug shot of Jim Hensley, the father-in-law of John McCain, taken at the time of his arrest in 1948 (he was later convicted of some federal bootlegging and related counts, and received a fine and a suspended sentence). All rather amusing. <br></p>",
  "<p>When the McCain campaign released the bad news it had accumulated in its post-haste vetting of Sarah Palin, it did so all at once, during the holiday weekend at the end of last month. They chose this strategy, as <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/02/us/politics/02assess.html\">one key campaign adviser promised a New York Times reporter</a>, \"to flush the toilet.\"</p> <p>And what a toilet it is. Just to pick one of the examples that actually relates to the issue of Palin's mode of governance \u2013 the ostensible reason she was chosen to be a heartbeat away from the presidency by a man with a 72-year-old ticker \u2013 is to enter a political and ethical looking-glass that makes Whitewater-era Arkansas appear to be a mirage of high-minded, almost Platonic public service. But while Whitewater obsessed Washington's journalists for almost a decade and led ultimately to the impeachment of an enormously popular president, 2008's version of <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/id/2200414\">Troopergate</a> has failed to inspire much in the way of outrage or even media interest.</p> <p>Despite any number of attempts to obscure them, the <a href=\"http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iT8pcyCcfWAEBpugJsgWD1CRsgSgD93AJUD00\">facts of the matter</a>, while complicated, are also clear. Last July, Palin demanded of Alaska's public safety commissioner, Walt Monegan - whom she had appointed to the job - that he fire her ex-brother-in-law, Mike Wooten, from his post as a state trooper. (Wooten was, at the time, in divorce proceedings with the governor's sister.) A formal investigation of Wooten was undertaken, with the result that he was briefly suspended from his job - a punishment that did little to satisfy Palin. At one point Monegan felt forced to warn the governor's husband Todd Palin: \"You can't head-hunt like this. What you need to do is back off, because if the trooper does make a mistake, and it is a terminable offense, it can look like political interference.\"</p> <p>Unable to get what she wanted, Sarah Palin fired Monegan, without offering much in the way of a cause or an explanation. Monegan soon fought back with his story of public pressure over a private matter. The apparent capriciousness of Palin's action led to an <a href=\"http://www.newsminer.com/news/2008/jul/28/lawmakers-formally-call-investigation-palins-publi/\">investigation by a bipartisan panel</a> in Alaska's legislature. At that point, Palin complained that Monegan had not been a \"team player on budgeting issues,\" and created <a href=\"http://blogs.tnr.com/tnr/blogs/the_stump/archive/2008/09/23/ap-palin-abuses-power-in-abuse-of-power-inquiry.aspx\">her own investigation</a> inside the Alaska attorney-general's office.</p> <p>This <a href=\"http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/09/palin_under_fire_at_home_for_t.php\">backfired</a>, however, when the attorney-general's office found that Palin's record was at odds with her public statements. In fact, members of her staff had sought Wooten's firing and - according to a recent report in the Washington Post - both Palin and her husband personally participated in the campaign to oust him.</p> <p>The Palins' <a href=\"http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/09/i-call-for-the.html\">new tactic</a> appears to be to try to shut down any investigation by virtue of <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/09/19/palin.investigation/\">non-cooperation</a>. Key witnesses have ignored subpoenas, including the Palins themselves. They have attacked Monegan both personally and politically. As the <a href=\"http://www.adn.com/opinion/story/529587.html\">Anchorage Daily News complained</a>: \"Palin and McCain are trying to ignite a partisan firestorm that wipes out the Troopergate investigation until after the [presidential] election.\"</p> <p>This may not be possible, as the Alaska legislature is <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1843678,00.html?imw=Y\">planning</a> to issue its report \u2013 as originally promised \u2013 by October 31. Whether this strategy of non-cooperation, disparagement and, by all appearances, dishonesty, will work as an effective cover-up strategy will depend on how interested the rest of the mainstream media remains in the story, and how well <a href=\"http://www.juneauempire.com/stories/092108/sta_334953142.shtml\">the McCain team's strategy</a> of attacking all media institutions works.</p> <p>It's hard to believe that America might actually be even more dishonestly, ineffectually and ideologically governed after January 20, 2009 than before it. But the Palin/Troopergate story, like so much of the tone and tenor of the McCain campaign post-nomination, offers ample evidence for just such a nightmare scenario.</p>",
  "<p>Three British players have been included among the nominees for the International Rugby Board player of the year award. Wales captain Ryan Jones and his international colleague Shane Williams feature on a five-strong list, alongside Scotland scrum-half Mike Blair. </p> <p>The other two contenders are New Zealand's imperious fly-half Dan Carter, who will begin a lucrative six-month contract with French club Perpignan in December, and Italy skipper Sergio Parisse. The winner of what is viewed as rugby union's most prestigious individual award will be announced in London on November 23. </p> <p>Jones led Wales to their second Six Nations title and Grand Slam in four years last season, and is favourite for Lions captaincy duties in South Africa next summer. His Ospreys team-mate Williams, meanwhile, broke Gareth Thomas's Wales try-scoring record last term, and has scored 43 tries in 58 Test appearances. The diminutive wing is regarded as one of world rugby's most dangerous attackers, and has been identified in many quarters as the favourite for the IRB award.</p> <p>Scrum-half Blair skippered Scotland to Calcutta Cup glory against England at Murrayfield last March, while Carter took the IRB's top accolade in 2005. Carter guided New Zealand to this year's Tri-Nations title, underlining his status as the world's leading fly-half, and Parisse has led Italy under the coaching regime of Nick Mallett, establishing himself among the most consistent number eights in international rugby.</p> <p>\"The IRB player of the year award is the ultimate accolade for a player,\" said IRB chairman Bernard Lapasset. \"It takes into account performances in all the major internationals played during the year, including the Six Nations, Tri-Nations and the June-July Tests. The list of past winners of this coveted award is impressive, and reads like a who's who of the international game in recent years. Jonny Wilkinson, Schalk Burger, Richie McCaw, Fabien Galthie, Dan Carter, Bryan Habana and Keith Wood were all worthy recipients of the award, while Carter would be the first player to win twice should he be selected.\"</p> <p>The awards judges, a panel that includes John Eales, Gavin Hastings and Francois Pienaar, will also vote on the IRB's team and coach of the year. Lapasset added: \"Now that the shortlist has been selected, the panel will reconvene during the November Tests when the IRB player of the year will be selected.\"</p> <p>Elsewhere, South Africa are attempting to bring southern hemisphere rugby into line with the rest of the global game by taking a stand against Australia and New Zealand over Experimental Law Variations (ELVs). The South African Rugby Union wants to ensure the 2009 Tri-Nations and Super 14 competitions are played under the same laws as next summer's Test series against the British and Irish Lions.</p> <p>That means ditching the controversial 'sanctions regulation' - where most penalties are replaced by free-kicks - which was used in this year's SANZAR competitions but does not feature in the global ELV trial. Australia and New Zealand are supporters of the sanctions regulation and believe it makes rugby a better product for spectators. </p> <p>They were informed of South Africa's stance on the ELVs overnight and the matter will be discussed at the SANZAR executive committee meeting in Sydney on October 15. If no consensus can be reached, SARFU would be prepared to take the matter to arbitration. \"We will play the Springbok end of year tour matches under the global ELVs and, most importantly, we will play the British and Irish Lions under the global ELVs next year,\" said SARFU president Oregon Hoskins. \"For consistency's sake and to allow our Springboks the smoothest possible preparations for next year's crucial series against the Lions it is vital that we play under one set of laws.\"</p>",

  "<p>The schools secretary Ed Balls today promised new plans to protect children from bullies and to strengthen parents' rights to make complaints about their child's education, in a speech designed to place him firmly on the side of working families. </p> <p>Local authorities are to set up new panels of volunteers to handle parents' complaints about their child's treatment and teaching quality at school. These panels will give parents an independent court in which to argue their child's case if they feel their child's education is not good enough. Forms of the panels will be piloted from next year before a national expansion. </p> <p>Balls said: \"We know that when mums and dads are involved in their children's education their children do better. We are ensuring that all parents can get regular updates of their child's progress by mobile phone or internet. We will now strengthen the complaints procedures for parents.\"</p> <p>In a personal speech, making reference to his wife, cabinet minister Yvette Cooper, and their three young children, Balls said it was hard for all parents to balance work and family life. Noting the resignation of the transport secretary Ruth Kelly earlier today, he said: \"As Ruth Kelly reminded us today, there is no more important job in the world than being a parent.\"</p> <p>Schools ministers will unveil more details later this week of plans for appeal panels for parental complaints, and a law change to compel schools to keep more accurate records of bullying incidents, following long-standing concerns that compulsory records are underused, meaning some pupils who struggle with bullying are not given the attention they need. </p> <p>Balls also gave a progress report on the National Challenge scheme, which will see all underperforming schools rapidly improving or having to become an academy, trust school or be closed within three years.</p> <p>Since the scheme was announced in June, officials have been scrutinising examination records and plans to improve. Those who haven't presented a convincing plan could face closure notices as soon as Christmas. </p> <p>The speech also revealed details of the first three National Challenge trusts, groups of schools who work together sometimes with business or charitable sponsorship that receive up to \u00a31m in government funding to improve. They include a secondary modern in Essex, after Balls highlighted the plight of schools with neighbouring grammars that cream off the academic high achievers from the area. </p> <p>He accused the Conservative party of attempting to keep the best education for a privileged elite, saying that they oppose plans to raise the school leaving age and create an overarching diploma which could subsume A-levels.</p> <p>\"This is a choice between the Conservative party determined to preserve excellence for those who have it and a Labour government committed to open up excellence and opportunity for all,\" he said.</p> <p>And he set out plans, revealed last week in the Guardian, to ensure schools are meeting their legal duty to limit teachers' workload. The move, designed to appeal to disenchanted public sector workers, will toughen up laws to protect teachers and school staff from excessive workload. </p> <p>There will a new statutory chair to act as a champion for classroom support staff, and he reiterated promises to reward headteachers for taking on responsibilities to help improve other schools with salaries of up to \u00a3200,000. </p> <p>The moves to win the \"hearts and minds\" of the school workforce to move forward with the agenda to improve failing schools received a warm welcome from unions in public. But privately it partially backfired after he picked out one teaching union, the National Association of School teachers Union of Women Teachers (NASUWT), praising them for their success in lobbying him over the move. </p> <p>Other unions were incensed by his apparent favouritism, while headteachers representatives worried that they were being portrayed causing excessive pressure on teachers at a time that they claim intense workloads are caused by government-driven initiatives.</p> <p>Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT, said: \"I am not in favour of setting up a new system to hear complaints from parents. What I am in favour of is using existing panels which provide an independent route such as the local government ombudsman to assess complaints.\"</p> <p>Teachers, she said, would question the independence of any panel with an exclusive parent membership set up to hear parents' complaints.</p> <p>The union did however welcome Balls' announcement to establish a national register of bullying incidents in schools \u2013 something the NASUWT has been calling for since 2006.</p> <p>She said: \"He is definitely a minister that has listened to us although we haven't always agreed with what he has said. We have been asking for a national register for some time so that bullying incidents can be monitored and strategy targeted.</p> <p>\"We would also like to see physical assaults recorded as well but this is a good first step towards getting a proper national register system. Schools are already recording racial and verbal assaults so it will not be a problem for them. It's just a question of adding another category.\"</p> <p>Christine Blower, acting general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, generally welcomed his proposals especially those to tackle bullying.</p> <p>But she said it was \"extraordinary\" that Balls should \"spoil his overall commitment to education by accelerating the expansion of the academies programme\".</p> <p>She described that decision as \"a fundamentally divisive move which is breaking up the local community of schools and creating disputes in community after community.\"</p> <p>The NUT, like the NASUWT, also had serious reservations about introducing parent panels to deal with parent complaints.</p> <p>Blower said: \"Parents want the best for their children and in all schools they are working with teachers to achieve that aim. Emphasis on complaints is counterproductive. Where problems arise there are already procedures in place through Ofsted and via governing bodies and local authorities. New procedures would not be helpful.\"</p>",
  "<p>Everyone has an agenda when it comes to reviewing movies.</p> <p>Corporate lackeys try to convince readers that every last bit of toxic slush spewed out by the Hollywood dream factory is actually gold.

  "<p>Last week saw the launch of Standing on the Shoulders of Giants, an evocatively named theatre company with a unique mission and an unusually, even for theatre, collaborative process of working. Giving diverse community groups the opportunity to engage creatively with the classics through the prism of their own life experiences is its mission. It is both the means to the final artistic product - the play - and an end in itself. </p> <p>In its first production, Pandora, Jennie Buckman, the artistic director of the company, wove the reflections and stories of women who attend the <a href=\"http://www.u3a.org.uk/index.php?option=com_frontpage&amp;Itemid=1\">Haringey University of the Third Age</a> and a group of Year 9 children from Gladesmore Community school into five cleverly interlinked mini-plays on fear, death, prejudice and old age - the plagues that escape Pandora's jar - which are partly mitigated by the ineffectuality of hope. For one of the contributors, 72-year-old Ruth Hutchinson, \"Hope is the opposite of rejection, not despair\". This line makes the final cut, as do many others - to the delight of the older women who feel a surge of pride and ownership when they spot their pearls of wisdom.</p> <p>This is diversity in the theatre at its best - reaching out across age, race, gender and class. Although many initiatives to encourage diversity have been put into place by major funders like the Arts Council, there is still a long way to go. As in television, such interventions have been successful at the lowest level - an increase in opportunities for actors and broadcasters - so we are beguiled by the visible diversity while the power structures remain largely unchanged. The majority of decision-makers continue to be white, middle-class and male. Whilst more black and minority companies are coming into existence, their infrastructure remains small and fragile. </p> <p>On paper, <a href=\"http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/aboutus/diversity.php\">the Arts Council's initiatives</a> are impressive - all their regularly funded clients must have race equality and disability action plans in place or lose their funding. However, in practice there are many get-out clauses. And when action is taken, it seems to show greater respect for the letter rather than the spirit of the law. </p> <p>Funding is only one arm of the pincer currently squeezing companies attempting to produce new work and reach new audiences. The other is an absence of dedicated venues. Venues are not prepared to take risks: they want productions that cater to the audiences that they have already built up. An ACE commissioned report in 2006, Sustained Theatre, recommended, among other things, the development of four gold-standard spaces to which such work could be toured. This is yet to happen. </p> <p>The funding equation is a tough one. <a href=\"http://www.stratfordeast.com/\">Theatre Royal Stratford East</a>, for example, which has done a lot to develop new-to-theatre local audiences, cannot break even on musicals, even if it fills all its 400 seats. Patricia Cumper, artistic director of Talawa, says that because theatre is expensive to produce, \"it is like an oil-tanker which can only turn around slowly, and theatre hasn't turned the corner on diversity yet\".</p> <p>Giants is currently standing on the shoulders of Talawa - which has provided guidance, office and rehearsal space - but is hoping soon to stand on its own two feet. So far the work of Giants has seen the light of day because of the generosity of friends, some of them across the Atlantic. Let's hope that shames some funders closer to home into reaching deep inside their pockets.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> Bolton, Manchester. <br> <strong>The lineup:</strong> Red AKA Rhys G Bradley (vocals, guitar), Matt Evans (guitar, vocals), Tommy T-Bone (drums), Wayne Riley (bass).</p> <p><strong>The background:</strong> To The Bones are a hard rock band from Bolton who are being rotated heavily, as they almost say, on MTV2 and that channel's Headbangers' Ball, but they're not some provincial bunch of sub-Leppard metal throwbacks or Maiden wannabes.</p> <p>Nor do they really fit into the death metal or grindcore categories - you won't find them on a bill with Defecation or Carcass, which no doubt will be a disappointment to their mums. And they're not nu metal. No, what they are is fast and hard and ... hard to define, fast. We were going to say they were a good, old-fashioned heavy rock unit, but that makes you think of Thin Lizzy's barnstorming boogie, and they're not that. They're a bit indie, which is perhaps why producer Dave Eringa (Manics, Idlewild, Ash) offered his services to the band for free after hearing them (before he heard them, he assumed they were a firm of postmodern undertakers and he really didn't want to get involved). There are also elements of grunge about them, and times when they sound like bands as disparate as Pixies and Motorhead. They've got one track called Sonic Mammoth that sounds like The Strokes if they'd formed after being exposed to Nirvana's Bleach, or what you might have imagined the Stooges' comeback album was going to sound like. <br> Their last single, Sharkies Bone Symphony, the video for which featured TVs being smashed, lashings of fake blood and general scenes of masochistic depravity, is a burst of extreme noise terror that could be an American Motorhead. Tycho is either the Beatles/Black Sabbath hybrid of your dreams or what a condensed history of Nirvana might sound like given some roar power by Lemmy. And new single Rex, recorded and mixed in 24 hours and featuring artwork by acclaimed comic book artist JackAdemus, is a weird cross between a tribal chant and Pixies at their most feral, vocalist Red bringing to mind Black Francis after a heavy night watching UFOs. Elsewhere, the singer does a compelling impression of Kurt Cobain after being nagged all night by Courtney.  To the Bones move with the force and efficiency of a machine. They make one hell of a racket, but it's nearly always melodic, the songs brutally concise. To say they will stand out like the proverbial sore thumb among all the nouveau synthpop, new new-wave indie-funk and retro-soul acts at the In The City band-fest in Manchester in early October is something of an understatement.  <strong>The buzz:</strong> \"The most urgently arresting rock debut in years.\" <br> <strong>The truth:</strong> Larynx-shreddingly intense vocals, crushingly memorable riffs - this column is officially Going Metal.<br> <strong>Most likely to:</strong> Spearhead a new wave of British heavy metal.<br> <strong>Least likely to:</strong> Manufacture spears. <br> <strong>What to buy:</strong> Debut album Duke Type A and single Rex are both released by Medici on September 29. <br> <strong>File next to:</strong> The Bronx, Motorhead, Pixies, QOTSA. <br> <strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/tothebones\">MySpace.com/tothebones</a> </p> <p><strong>Tomorrow's new band:</strong> Daniel Land &amp; The Modern Painters.</p>",
  "<p>A straw poll of senior transport industry figures this morning suggests that Ruth Kelly, who has now set her satnav for the backbenches, did a good job in her 15 months as transport secretary. </p> <p>An aviation executive said: \"Sorry to see her going.\" A prominent green activist said: \"She has done a lot of good things.\" A bus and rail group executive added: \"It is a blow that she is going.\" And a motoring campaigner, not an obvious candidate for supporting Labour ministers, said: \"She had started to address the problem of congestion on our motorways.\"</p> <p>Ruth Kelly built this coalition on a very New Labour pick-and-mix of policy approaches, hovering between being pro-green and then pro-airport expansion, between the heavy hand of government and then letting the private sector have a big role in running public transport. </p> <p>That coalition was built by: signalling her support for a third runway at Heathrow, steering through a rail white paper that left private ownership of rail franchises and the overall structure of the industry untouched, introducing a concessionary bus fare scheme that allowed over-60s to travel the UK for free, and deftly sidelining a national road pricing scheme for at least the term of this government. </p> <p>And with the vehemently anti-pay-as-you-drive Tories likely to win the next election, that means road pricing is off the agenda for a while yet.</p> <p>But do not mistake those compliments or lists of achievements from all sectors of the transport world for a consensus that Ruth Kelly had a coherent vision for Britain's transport needs. </p> <p>The attempt to stamp a broader framework on transport policy - Towards a Sustainable Transport System, published 13 months ago - had its green hue rather tarnished by a consultation on Heathrow airport that reiterated support for a third runway at Britain's busiest airport. </p> <p>Also, the concessionary fares scheme is admirable in intent - transport executives, used to being in the background at party conferences, were thrilled that Gordon Brown mentioned it in his speech - but a significant number of bus operators, local councils and, apparently, Department for Transport officials, believe it has a glaring funding gap.</p> <p>So, let's give those straw poll respondents' views a bit more air. </p> <p>Stephen Joseph, the executive director of the Campaign for Better Transport, said: \"Ruth Kelly has done a lot of good things, but she has been an apostle for airport expansion. It just seems so odd that her espousal of low-carbon transport has been combined with such a gung-ho attitude towards building more runways.\" </p> <p>Anyone familiar with environmental groups' views will not be surprised by that appraisal, but the most centrist road and motoring advocates also argue that Kelly and her predecessors have had no time to impose a long-term plan.</p> <p>Edmund King, the president of the AA, says: \"Ruth Kelly had started to address the problems of congestion on our motorways. But we have had 11 transport secretaries in 20 years and now we are waiting for number 12. She has only been transport secretary since June 2007 and the real problem is that it takes someone 12 months to get up to speed with their brief. </p> <p>\"Transport is vital for the country and the economy, yet it seems to be a merry-go-round for ministers to hop on and hop off.\"</p> <p>At a fringe meeting yesterday Kelly was energetic, full of ideas and well in control of her brief. Admittedly, neither she nor her predecessor is likely to bin a third runway at Heathrow, but she at least displayed an enthusiasm and intellectual vigour for the job that some predecessors have lacked. </p> <p>Perhaps she could have overseen the detailed 20-year infrastructure document that Britain needs - why shouldn't airport policy be considered in tandem with road and high-speed rail plans? - but the longevity of the transport post, and of this Labour government, seems to preclude it.</p>",

  "<p>We have become a risk-averse society which is creating a generation of children with an \"unhealthy\" suspicion of adults, Lady Julia Neuberger warned last night.</p> <p>Our obsessive fear of sexual predators on young people has meant our schools and children's homes have become uninviting institutions \u2013 only open to those who have passed a criminal records bureau check, said the Liberal Democrat peer and the prime minister's 'volunteering champion.' </p> <p>The failure to open up schools and children's homes as places where people can \"pass through\" is denying children, especially those in care, from leading \"normal lives\" and is fuelling a culture of suspicion.</p> <p>Neuberger, Britain's first female rabbi to run her own synagogue, said: \"The fact that we have become so stringent in our requirements about checks on those who work or have any relationship with children has perverse consequences.</p> <p>\"First, children themselves are encouraged to be suspicious of adults in a way that may be both unhealthy for themselves and for society as a whole.</p> <p>\"Second, those who are inclined to work with children or look after a young person who is distressed\u2026 will be very nervous of getting involved.\"</p> <p>This is particularly true of men which means that many \"of our most trouble young people\" have no regular male role model in their households and they are missing out on the opportunity to discover \"what being an ordinary, stable, feeling, understanding man is all about,\" she said. </p> <p>Our risk-averse society has also made us a more selfish society \u2013 one that is forever looking inward, she said in a lecture delivered to the Royal Society of Arts last night, as part of a series of with the theme of \"A Decline in Values\" organised by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation.</p> <p>She said: \"The idea that we have an obligation to society beyond the demands we ourselves wish to make of it is becoming unfashionable.\" </p> <p>She said: \"Utilitarianism \u2013 the greatest happiness\u2026 for the greatest number is a philosophy now held in severe disrepute.\"</p> <p>Those people who are \"genuinely altruistic\" are finding it increasingly difficult to get involved, she pointed out.</p> <p>She said: \"Those who simply want to help make a difference because they cannot bear looking at their community as it is, often find it extremely hard to lend a hand. </p> <p>\"And that is because we have become seriously risk-averse - fearful as a nation, scared of terrorists, child molesters and violence on the street - and as a result we make it harder and harder to help those who need our aid, and we become more and more withdrawn into ourselves.\"</p> <p>Making our schools and children's homes more open so that \"ordinary people\" can see what happens inside their walls she suggested will help develop our closed communities and make us more unselfish.</p> <p>She said: \"Of course we will need to be careful.

  "<p>The idea that British Energy might be worth more than \u00a312bn to a foreign buyer such as EDF would have brought hoots of laughter had it been predicted six years ago.</p> <p>The country's main generator of nuclear power had, at that time, been brought to its knees by plunging power prices, and had gone cap in hand to government for a bailout.</p> <p>It was an embarrassing failure for a company proudly privatised in 1996 by Conservative ministers who were keen to prove that even atomic power was not best managed by the state.</p> <p>But British Energy is no financial embarrassment now. It has generated profits of nearly \u00a3800m over the last two years although it is of primary interest to EDF for the ground it owns rather than the eight ageing nuclear plants and one coal-fired plant it runs.</p> <p>The nuclear sites - particularly Sizewell in Suffolk and Bradwell in Essex - are prime locations for a new generation of atomic facilities which EDF and a supportive UK government want at a time of increasing concerns about energy security and climate change.</p> <p>British Energy was created in 1995 with nuclear assets which had originally formed part of the state-owned Central Electricity Generating Board and South of Scotland Electrcity Board. </p> <p>Five English advanced gas-cooled reactors (AGRs) and the one pressurised water reactor from Nuclear Electric were put together with two AGRs from Scottish Nuclear. </p> <p>The remaining Magnox power stations, from Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear, went to Magnox Electric, later to become part of British Nuclear Fuels Ltd (BNFL). The Eggborough coal plant was purchased by British Energy in an attempt to diversify its portfolio.</p> <p>The business made a strong start to life on the stock market after 88.5% of the shares were sold by the government at 100p per share, raising \u00a31.2bn from private investors, in July 1996. </p> <p>By September the following year, the share price had doubled and it was to go on to reach 750p at its best in early 1999.</p> <p>The company that generated nearly a quarter of Britain's electricity was benefiting from a strong rise in the cost of wholesale energy prices. </p> <p>It was not long, however, before the government's introduction of new wholesale trading arrangements changed the picture.</p> <p>British Energy's profits and shares began to rattle down as deregulation brought in new competitors who pushed down prices. </p> <p>In total, the price of wholesale electricity fell 40% in four years, although British Energy added to its own crisis with its ageing reactors increasingly prone to unexpected breakdown.</p> <p>By the middle of 2000, British Energy shares were back where they started at 100p each. Within 24 months, the company had run up an annual loss of \u00a3518m, had debts of more than \u00a31bn and was fighting for its survival.</p> <p>In fact, most electricity generators were finding it hard to make money. Some rivals switched off their power stations, while at least one, TXU, went bust. </p> <p>Many of the big power companies survived the crunch because they had a retail arm which benefited from the lower wholesale prices. British Energy had no such prop. It had bought the Welsh electricity and the gas supplier Swalec in 1999 but, finding it impossible to pick up further assets at decent prices, soon sold it off again, to Scottish &amp; Southern Electric.</p> <p>The nuclear generator asked ministers to help by giving it exemptions from business rates and the climate change levy, the latter on the grounds that it was a low carbon energy producer. </p> <p>It also suggested it should be allowed to take over operations of BNFL's magnox power stattions to earn new revenues, but none of these initiatives came to anything.</p> <p>Robin Jeffrey, the then chairman of British Energy, said the company had no alternative than to seek government support while trade and industry secretary, Patricia Hewitt, insisted there was \"no question at all of taxpayers writing a blank cheque to British Energy and its shareholders.\"</p> <p>It was given a loan of \u00a3410m and its shares, suspended at the height of the problems, started trading again while ministers worked on a wider restructuring plan which would give bondholders more than 90% of the company's equity in a \u00a31.3bn debt-for-equity swap. </p> <p>Small shareholders were all but wiped out in what was seen by some as a de facto renationalisation of a group which, for safety reasons, could never be left to cease operations. But the most controversial element of the deal was the fact that the Department of Trade and Industry agreed to take on \u00a35.1bn of decommissioning liabilities. </p> <p>The government had arranged for a \"cash sweep\" under which its shares of the profits from British Energy were set aside to pay for clean-up, but then converted this into an equity stake. </p> <p>Ministers are now intending that a large element of the \u00a34bn worth of sales proceeds going to the state for their remaining 35% holding can now be used to pay off any final bill for cleaning up the eight nuclear sites.</p> <p>The value of the business has increased dramatically since Britain gave the go-ahead to a new generation of nuclear power stations, setting no limits on nuclear expansion and adding momentum for a worldwide renaissance of atomic energy. </p> <p>In March, Gordon Brown and Nicholas Sarkozy said they would like to see Britain and France working together to help export their nuclear expertise abroad amid speculation that EDF was going to bid for British Energy and the French atomic plant designer, Areva, could be made a preferred bidder to win a potential \u00a317bn clean-up contract for Sellafield.</p> <p>By May, EDF had emerged as the only possible bidder for British Energy, dashing hopes for an auction as other potential purchasers, RWE of Germany and Iberdrola of Spain, quit the race. In August the British nuclear generator said it was in \"advanced talks\" with an unnamed party about a possible offer. </p> <p>British Energy has seen its contribution to electricity production fall from a quarter to 14% due to a series of unexpected outages at its power plants, but EDF, which already operates around 80 reactors, is a serious enough buyer - and \u00a312bn is no laughing matter. </p>",

Since space is limited, I'll jump straight in. </p> <p>I believe that <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1023346.html\">Paul McCartney</a>'s concert should not go ahead, firstly on account of Israel 's ongoing crimes against the Palestinians, and secondly, because I believe that a boycott plays an effective role in a wider campaign for a just peace in Palestine and Israel.</p> <p>(I'd like to add that while someone might disagree with the first premise \u2013 and hence consider the boycott ridiculous or sinister \u2013 it's possible to agree with this assessment of Israel 's past and present, but consider a boycott to be tactically flawed.)</p> <p>McCartney will play in Tel Aviv's <a href=\"http://www.telavivguide.net/Entertainment_and_Art/Family_and_Kids/Tel_Aviv_Hayarkon_Park_20051026163/\">Hayarkon Park</a>, on the site of a Palestinian village destroyed in 1948. There are hundreds of such spots all over Israel, a \"ghost map\" of communities emptied of the unwanted Arab population who remain refugees.</p> <p>The ethnic cleansing of historic Palestine 1948 that made it possible to create a Zionist state are not simply history. Israel continues its efforts to erase Palestine from the map; like in the occupied territories, where an apartheid regime of privileges separates Israelis from the stateless Palestinians.</p> <p>Dismantling this regime is the way to create a peaceful tomorrow for Jews and Palestinians. As Israel continues to show no desire to voluntarily withdraw or surrender its power, a boycott is just one tactic in this struggle. McCartney should stay away.</p> <p><strong>Alex to Ben</strong></p> <p>Ben, thanks for kicking things off. I oppose the idea that McCartney should boycott Israel. At the same time, I think an artist's conscience should play a role in where she or he plays. The question before us, then, is what should McCartney's conscience dictate he do?</p> <p>I'm more interested in what's effective than what's right or wrong. What can McCartney do to improve the situation according to the wishes of the Israeli and Palestinian populations on the ground? Practically this means what can McCartney do to advance the cause of a two-state solution along the lines of the <a href=\"http://www.geneva-accord.org/HomePage.aspx?FolderID=11&amp;lang=en\">Geneva initiative</a>? We know this is the desired outcome, because poll after poll shows that between two-thirds and three-quarters of Israelis and Palestinians support such a solution. (I'm not dogmatically opposed to some sort of \"one-state\" solution, by the way. The moment the people of the land support it, I won't be one of those standing in their way.)</p> <p>How can McCartney do his little bit to work towards this outcome? Luckily, we already have precedent. <a href=\"http://www.brain-damage.co.uk/archive/roger-waters-changes-israeli-concert-venue.html\">Roger Waters</a> of Pink Floyd (how I wish this debate concerned New York rappers instead of ageing rockers!), after the inevitable pressure from the pro and anti-boycott lobbies, decided to perform at <a href=\"http://nswas.org/\">Neve Shalom-Wahat al-Salam</a>, a village jointly established by Jewish and Palestinian Arab citizens of Israel. He also demonstrated his opposition to the separation barrier.</p> <p>Surely this is the most effective course of action? Come to the country, engage with the local population, do your bit to encourage them to learn to live in peace. By boycotting you simply miss the chance to have an impact. This is why I disagree with your claim that a boycott plays an effective role in the campaign for a wider peace, although I'd be interested to hear you spell out precisely what that wider peace would look like and what steps Israel would have to take for the boycott to be ended.</p> <p><strong>Ben to Alex</strong></p> <p>I'd like to begin by pointing out what I felt you didn't respond to from my initial email: the description of Israel's land theft and ethnic cleansing of Palestine, past and present. This despite it being the foundational reason for the pro-boycott argument I laid out. You do say, however, that you're \"more interested in what's effective than what's right or wrong\". This can seem like you either dispute the reality of Israeli discrimination since 1948, or even, that you're not sure whether it is \"right or wrong\".</p> <p>I was also interested that you based a significant part of your reply on the apparent support amongst Israelis and Palestinians for the Geneva accord. There are two problems with this tack. Firstly, it means the approach rests almost entirely on unspecified polling data, which is then used as cast-iron proof of what a majority of both peoples want, and thus what we should all be working towards.</p> <p>But secondly, even if the Geneva accord was the holy grail, this still wouldn't mean that concerts and \"engagement\" are the right way forward. That's because Israel is completely unwilling to allow a sovereign Palestine to emerge in the occupied territories. Colonisation continues apace, settlements are integrated into Israel's infrastructure, and international law is laughed at daily. \"Coexistence\" concerts can only provide theme music for subordinate, colonial \"autonomy\"; not usher in independence. <br> (Incidentally, I haven't taken up your invitation to \"spell out precisely\" what a wider peace would look like, as I thought that it is not really the specific focus of this debate \u2013 plus relevant thoughts of mine are readable elsewhere.)</p> <p><strong>Alex to Ben</strong></p> <p>I didn't deal with the issue of Israel's creation because there isn't much room to discuss it constructively in such a short space. Suffice to say that I disagree with the claim that Israel was founded on ethnic cleansing. Am I to take from your emphasis on 1948 that Israel would have to return to the pre-partition days (right of return as well) for the boycott to end? If that's the case, I wish you luck. This is what Noam Chomsky calls the politics of Mars, while in the real world, suffering continues. Either way, it's crucial that you state absolutely clearly what steps Israel would have to take for your support of the boycott to end, both for the readers' benefit and for mine.</p> <p>The issue of \"right or wrong\": Even if you could demonstrate to me that encouraging McCarthy to boycott Israel was somehow morally appropriate, you would then have to prove it to be an effective strategy. I would dispute that. Israelis aren't particularly reliant on foreigners for their entertainment. There's a vibrant home-grown scene in all aspects of the arts \u2013 music, theatre, literature \u2013 testament to the extraordinary revival of the Hebrew language. If McCartney decided not to come for political reasons, the Israeli population would collectively shrug its shoulders. They would ask \"Why is Israel the only country he has decided to boycott?\" and then carry on with their lives.</p> <p>Geneva accords: polls aren't cast-iron. But they have repeatedly shown clear majority support for some sort of two-state solution. Your line about a concert at Neve Shalom being \"theme music\" is cute, but inaccurate. What is more likely to change hearts and minds? McCartney playing Neve Shalom and calling on 50,000 people to take real steps to give Palestinians a genuine, sovereign state, or signing up to the <a href=\"http://www.pacbi.org/\">PACBI letter</a>? As Chomsky has stated, the choice is between the politics of Mars and the politics of the real world. <br> <strong>Ben to Alex</strong></p> <p>Inevitably, there are two different emphases that have developed here: one, related to Israel's history and what a just solution would look like, and two, the usefulness or otherwise of the boycott.</p> <p>It's revealing that for you, an \"emphasis on 1948\" seems worthy of comment. Such a reference point would go without saying for Palestinians: expelled 60 years ago, they watched as their land disappeared under new Jewish towns and picnic parks, unreachable behind barriers, gun barrels, and a web of discriminatory legislation.</p> <p>Of course, it's not actually about returning to a vanished past, except in the sense of acknowledging what happened \u2013 which you don't. Quite simply, Palestinians should have the same rights in Palestine and Israel as Jewish Israelis do: the rights of residence, land ownership, and nationality (to name a few). All the things, in fact, they have been systematically deprived of since the foundation stones of Israeli statehood were laid on the rubble of the <a href=\"http://www.amin.org/look/amin/en.tpl?IdLanguage=1&amp;IdPublication=7&amp;NrArticle=40539&amp;NrIssue=1&amp;NrSection=3\">Nakba</a>.</p> <p>The \"politics of Mars\" seems to be shorthand for ideas deemed far-fetched and impossible, conveniently fenced-off from \"sensible\" discussion. Yet once more, you appear to believe that the liberation of even the occupied territories will be advanced by McCartney mid-set \"calling\" on people to do the right thing.</p> <p>Like the hope that the Palestinians will \"recognise\" their own dispossession, that seems to be a far more fanciful path to peace when compared to the growing, international movement of boycott, divestment and sanctions, aimed at applying the kind of meaningful pressure Israel has so far avoided. All of this in order that Palestinian rights are finally respected and both peoples can breathe easily, removed from the suffocating grip of a colonial relationship endangering everyone concerned.<br><strong><br>Alex to Ben</strong></p> <p>It's not that 1948 isn't of importance. I merely disagree with your claim that Israel is solely responsible for the fate of the Palestinians. The Palestinians chose to reject the UN <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/p/nea/rls/22562.htm\">partition resolution</a>, which was the least bad solution on offer. The logic for rejecting partition is the same logic for rejecting some sort of binational solution: there wasn't much difference \u2013 in 1947 \u2013 between the argument supporting sharing a single state with the Jews and the argument supporting partitioning the land with the Jews. As <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benny_Morris\">Benny Morris</a> notes, \"Without doubt, Arab expulsionism fuelled Zionist expulsionist thinking during the 1930s and 1940s.\" The few Palestinians that did support what today is called a one-state solution tended to meet a violent end.</p> <p>Today, a majority of the Palestinian people on the ground support a two-state solution. I do as well, although I hope that eventually a more integrated future might be possible. I support Palestinians having rights of residence in the new Palestinian state, land ownership and nationality (plus I support the right of Israeli-Palestinians to full land equality, a topic I have written about in the past). </p> <p>If the Palestinians recognising their own dispossession is what you understand by their strong support for a two-state solution, so be it. I'd suggest you take that up with them. In the meantime, focusing efforts on getting the likes of McCartney to boycott Israel is the worse kind of gesture politics, an alternative to the difficult task of building trust on the ground, work done admirably at places like Neve Shalom, a place you don't seem to see as fit for hosting the Beatles' finest.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Preamble:</strong> <br>It's Wednesday and both these problem children are full of woe. One of them will be spanked tonight and one will get the morale boost that comes with discovering that they are not, after all, the most hopeless kid on the block. But which will be which, readers, which will be which? Or is it to unfair to ask that question? After all, we can't rule out the possibility that both these laughable outfits will find a way to lose \u2026 </p> <p>Having won just four matches since their last Carling Cup game - the final last February - Juande Ramos's rabble are on a run so unconvincing that it long ago became a stagger. But though they remain significantly less than the sum of their parts and are playing about as coherently as swuivhyvajjfhtzzxatxzmmcycyoafn, at least Shambles B have a manager \u2013 unlike Shambles A, for whom the stand-in ringmaster tonight will again be Chris Hughton who, in fairness, does have a curious knack of being on the scene whenever Shambles B balls things up spectacularly. </p> <p><strong>Teams:</strong><br><strong>Shambles A:</strong> Given, Geremi, Taylor, Coloccini, Bassong, Cacapa, Butt, N'Zogbia, Owen, Duff, Martins. <br><strong>Subs:</strong> Harper, Xisco, Ameobi, Edgar, Tozer, Doninger, Donaldson.</p> <p><strong>Shambles B</strong>: Gomes, Zokora, King, Woodgate, Corluka, Lennon, Jenas, Assou-Ekotto, O'Hara, Bale, Pavlyuchenko. <br><strong>Subs:</strong> Cesar, Bentley, Bent, Gilberto, Modric, Giovani, Campbell.</p> <p><strong>Referee:</strong> Chris Foy (<strong>whose claim to fame is that he once sent off Fulham mascot Billy the Badger for breakdancing too enthusiastically</strong>)</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>7:41pm:</strong> \"If the Spurs don't win tonight could this be the end of Comolli, Ramos, the whole lot?\" warbles George Templeton. It's highly unlikely that both would get the boot, George \u2013 and given how long they spent courting Ramos, how little time he has had in charge, how much compensation they would have to pay and how much they've misspent on Commoli's advice, my suspicion is the Frenchman would be first out.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>7:43pm:</strong> The number of conscientious objectors among the Toon Army is huge if the rows and rows of empty seats in St James' Park is anything to go by. \"I have been gazing at that Spurs team and wondering what shape it's going to play,\" confides Alan Cooper. \"How silly of me \u2013 they're obviously not going to have any shape.\"</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>1 min:</strong> Kick-off was taken by Newcastle ... successfully!</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>3 min:</strong> Colocconi nuts the ball clear an clatters into lone Shambles B striker Pavlyucnheno in the process, conceding a free-kick but escaping a booking. \"Would Levy - and Ramos for that matter - swap their first XI for Arsenal's Carling Cup Under 21s given the choice?\" squeals Elliot Jacobs, who obviously doesn't know what happened the last time the young Gunners</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>5 min:</strong> Bassong demonstrates how quickly he has immersed adapted to Newcastle by stroking the ball straight to an opponent in his own box. Lennenon is quickly crowded out by Basssong's team-mates, however.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>7 min:</strong> Jenas gets into a gallop for the first time, then slides a decent ball through to Pavlyuchenko, who decides to hit it first time from the right, about 25 yards out. His effort flew into the vacant seats behind the goal.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>10 min:</strong> Geremi floats a long free-kick towards the six-yard box, whereupon Taylor collides gently with Gomes, who collapses Dido-style and is now receiving treatment.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>12 min:</strong> Sky's commentator has just revealed that that there are rumours that Terry Venables could soon take chage at St James' Park, prompting co-commentator Brian Marwood to suggest \"they need someone of that elk\". Yes, he would certainly put the moose in order.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>15 min:</strong> This really is pedestrian stuff from both sides. There s nothing more to say. Except maybe this: \"I can't believe that you did not begin your coverage of this match with a preshamble \u2026,\" honks Steve Gaw.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>17 min:</strong> Duff attempts to scurry into the box but then turns back, as befits a man whose confidence has been in tatters for about three seasons. He ends up knocking the ball back to Butt, who hoofs an attempted cross miles over the bar. Ho, hum. \"Why is Zokora playing at right-back,\" storms Robin Lewis. He isn't, Corluka is at right-back, Zokora is one of the ineffective central midfielders.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>19 min:</strong> Bale swings in a free-kick from the left and Woodgate gets a toe to it, enough to prod it a mere 14 yards wide. Does that really have to go down as the game;s first shot?</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>21 min: </strong> Shambles A force a corner after the first bit of sustained pressure from either team in the match. King heads it clear but the home side quickly regain possession and recycle it to Nzogbia, who cuts in from the right and lashes a fine shot at Gomes, who holds it well.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>22 min:</strong> Butt chops down Bale to pick up his customary yellow card.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>25 min:</strong> Shambles B attempt to build some composure by stroking the ball around at the back. They were going nowhere until Jenas, possibly ashamed, simply whacked it forward to Given. yes, this game really is more scrappy than Scooby Doo's feisty young cousin.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>28 min:</strong> Coloccini performs a comical backheel in his own box, enabling Jenas to stretch and slip the ball to O'Hara ... whose poor first touch sends the ball out of play. \"With Duff and Butt on the Geordies, no wonder Newcastle's midfield if half-arsed,\" hardy-hars Corey Atkinson. So we've been reduced to this ...</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>30 min:</strong> Nope, still nothing.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>32 min:</strong> Gomes collects a loopy cross. \"They don't call him the octopus for nothing,\" chirps Sky's commentator, referring to the cephalopod that is, of course, renowned for its ability to catch footballs.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>33 min:</strong> Shambles B's first chance of the game! Pavlyuchenko escapes the attention of Coloccini with effortless ease and glances Jenas's corner just wide.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>35 min:</strong> Lennon attempts a cross. (Do I really need to add that it was wildly inaccurate?). \"This reminds me of when Gary Lineker said he preferred watching Wimbledon on Teletext,\" guffs Adam Levine. \"I'm a Spurs supporter and I think I'd rather have than a jalapeno high colonic than follow this current shower on MBM.\"</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>38 min:</strong> After flaccid attacking by Newcastle, Leenon busrts down the right and fires in a genuinely menacing cross ... insofar as it was straight at Coloccini and there's always a chance that a player in black and white will turn the ball into his own net. \"Scrappy was Scooby's nephew, not his cousin,\" barks Nathan Smith, exposing my lack of knowledge of crummy 1970s cartoon capers. \"Speaking of Scooby Doo, how is Shaggy Woodgate getting on at the heart of the Shambles B's comical defence?\" Well, if you wanted to be charitable you could say he's kept Michael Owen quiet. On the other hand, you could simply acknowledge that Shambles A's clueless build-up play has made that job extremely simple.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>40 min:</strong> Martins jinks into a dangerous position on the right but pulls his cross behind Owen. \"Given the rumours about El Tel, it was prescient of you to have put a photo of him at the top of the MBM,: hisses Ronan Hayes.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>42 min:</strong> Pavlyuchenko jumps for a header and flips his elbow into Coloccini's face, bloodying the Argentine's nose. I'd like to say it looked accidental ...</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>45 min:</strong> Zokora wins the ball in midfield and barges towards the box only to be dispossessed by Geremi. The Cameroonian bounds back up the other end and taps the ball sideways to Nzogbia, whereupon O'Hara sees the counter gathering steam and resolves to pull his opponent down, earning a yellow card. Geremi's free-kick from 40 yards almost bounces straight into the net as everyone stood and watched! Bu instead it went just wide. \"Regarding Tottenham's formation, surely it is pear-shaped?\" chortles Jason Averitt.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>Half-time:</strong> I'm not trying to be snide - the truth us I can't remember the last time I saw a match as bad as this. But I probably played in it. There has been next to nothing to suggest these are professional players, save a few dinky touches from Jenas, some raking balls by Geremi and lightning runs by Lennon that end with a whimper. I'm genuinely curious to see if things can possibly get worse in the second period. \"If either of these team's fans setup an alternative club to follow, like AFC Wimbledon and FC United, would they be called Babyshambles?\" guffaws Nathan Smith.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>Just to show I'm not exaggerating:</strong> Even Jeff Stelling on Sky has just said \"it's like the game is being played in slow motion ... let's just get straight to penalties?\" Which, of course, begs the question: has a penalty shoot-out ever ended 0-0? Stay tuned, folks, we would be about to witness history ...</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>46 min:</strong> Brace yourselves, the second half is under way ...</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>47 min:</strong> ACTION STATION! Nzogbia swung the ball in from the left, Martins flicked it on brilliantly to Duff, who took it in his stride and romped into the box before slipping the ball past Gomes ... but the retreating Woodgate slides in touch it out for a corner!</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>49 min:</strong> Coloccini has looked very shaky tonight and he's just committed another error, passing the ball to Bale before bolting forward to await the return pass! Bale failed to exploit this ineptitude, shooting well wide first time from 25 yards.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>52 min: </strong> Giovani is warming, sparking hopes of change.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>53 min:</strong> Giovani replaces Bale. Lennon will shift to the left.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>55 min:</strong> \"It's a frustrating match ... and if you've just got home after missing the first half - congratulations!\" booms Sky's commentator. Hyping this match up is an impossibility.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>57 min:</strong> Assou-Ekotto relieves the tedium with a barnstorming run down the left, then rewards himself with a fierce shot from 20 yards that Given spills. The keeper recovers just before Pavlyuchenko could pounce.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>59 min:</strong> After Pavlyuchenko fluffed a fine chance, the home team tore down the other end. Martins picked out Butt, who tapped a subtle bal through to Owen, who spun King brilliantly before firing at Gomes, who parried it behind for a corner. This game is actually improving!</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Shambles A 0-1 Shambles B (Pavlyuchenko 61')</strong></p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>61 min:</strong> Butt sloppily lost possession in the middle and the visitors worked the ball out to Lennon on the left. For once he looked up and flighted a fine ball into the centre, where Pavlyuchenko, with Coloccini and Bassong merely watching, headed past Given from seven yards.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>63 min:</strong> Threatening free-kick to Shambles A, on the rim of the opposing box ... Geremi'scurler is blocked by Woodgate.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Shambles A 0-2 Shambles B (O'Hara 66') </strong></p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>66 min:</strong> Good grief that was atrocious defending! 30 yards from their own goal, Coloccini rolled a slow ball across to Taylor, who attempted to thwart O'Hara's interception with a comical feint. It didn't work, of course, and O'Hara cantered through on goal to fire the ball past Given.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>68 min:</strong> Shambles B have gradually evolved into Spurs, a slightly fluid unit that is a class above the jokers in black and white. If this doesn't knock a few quid of Mike Ashley's asking price ...</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>71 min:</strong> Shambles A switch: Duff totters off to be replaced by Xisco. And Edgar comes on for Cacapa.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>73 min:</strong> With their confidence bolstered, Spurs are beginning to lord it over their hosts, who are reduced to chasing after the ball like panicky kids. \"It's great to see that the team formerly known as Newcastle Comedy Club can still defend so gloriously,\" gurgles Patrick Carr. \"And to do it without Titus Bramble - pure genius!\"</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>75 min:</strong> Spurs switch: Modric trots on in place of Pavlyuchenko.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>77 min:</strong> Nzogbia steals the ball in midfield and sprints forward. With Owen lurking to his left, the Frenchman elects to drive the ball 15 yards wide. \"Magpies?\" intones Gary Naylor. \"Aren't they the birds known for acquiring rubbish?\"</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>79 min:</strong> After a long period of misguided passes by both sides, Bassong races down the left and sends in a reasonable cross that is cut out by Woodgate.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>82 min:</strong> Gomes surges out of his box to get to a through-ball fractionally before Owen, and belt it to safety. \"Shambles A v Shambles B? You sir are a cad and a bounder,\" yells Jerry Thomas. \"Having said that, as a lifelong Spurs fan I'm expecting them to still balls this up.\"</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>84 min:</strong> Martins receives the ball i the box and outfoxes Corluka, who skids past him like an out-of-control car, but Woodgate is on hand to divert the ball out for a corner, which is wasted. \"Quick someone get that promising young Mexican player that Newcastle signed a few years agom\" roars Rodrigo Moya. \"You know, that one that got them into the Champions League by beating Liverpool in the last minute. Santiago Munez, I think it was. Oh wait, that was a movie. My bad. Still more enjoyable than this rubbish, mind.\"</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>87 min:</strong> Off-balance, Taylor shanks an O'Hara cross behind for a corner. The visitors take it short, then knock the ball around to waste time. The home side make a token effort at chasing them.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>89 min:</strong> The game's just petering out. \"What's the attendance at St James' Park tonight?\" asks Jason Keegan, who may or may not be related to you know who. In numerical terms, it's 19,743. In broader terms, it is sad proof that there are almost 20,000 people in the north-east who had nothing better to do tonight than feast on this swill.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Shambles A 1-2 Shambles B (Owen 90') </strong> Ok, maybe it's not petering out! Certainoly the visiting defenders thought so, as they completely switched off and allowed Geremi to jog down the right and put in a low cross. Gomes dived to palm it out, but only as far as Owen, who, from about 15 yards, slammed it high into the net.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>90+2 min:</strong> Free-kick to the home side, it's central and about 40 yards out. Geremi's delivery is dangerous, but O'Hara rises to nod it behind for a corner. Given comes up for it, but Nzogbia's corner failed to beat the man at the near post.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>Full-time:</strong> The lowest crowd since the revamp St James' park greet the final whistle with boos. And would be excused for turning to booze to forget about it asap. As for you, patient readers, thanks for tuning in to this ordeal. Please call again.</p>",

  "<p>\"How many divisions has the Pope?\" asked a sneering Stalin when discussing the power of the pontiff. It is tempting to ask the same question about Ruth Kelly, one of the Pope's most pious political followers, after the leak of her <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/24/ruthkelly.labour\">imminent departure</a> from Gordon Brown's government. For Kelly, in the macho political calculus which comes most naturally to the prime minister, counts for little beyond herself. She is a low-profile minister, neither brilliant nor useless, proud but not pushy, better than her reputation but not any kind of threat to his leadership. Like the Pope, she has no divisions either. If there is a network of Kellyites out there in the Labour party, then all I can say is they are well hidden. If they exist at all, they must operate at a level of deep secrecy reminiscent of, say, <a href=\"http://www.opusdei.org/\">Opus Dei</a>, of which the transport secretary is supposedly a member herself.</p> <p>As resignations go, therefore, this one is plainly on the low end of the political Richter scale. Small earthquake in Manchester; not many affected. Kelly says she is leaving for personal reasons and all those who know her (she used to work for the Guardian before she became an MP in 1997) will know that these are real. She has four young children and it is, quite simply, impossible to combine real parental presence with the 24/7 demands of modern politics. She is not going to go out on to the steps of the Labour conference and denounce Brown and all his works \u2013 as her comments today have already made clear. In that sense, Kelly's going is much less damaging to Brown than the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2008/sep/16/labour.labourleadership\">departure</a> a week ago of the far less senior Scotland Office minister (and fellow Catholic) David Cairns.</p> <p>But it is a resignation nevertheless. And it is absolutely not the Wednesday story that Brown wants the world to focus on. Downing Street will be very angry about it as they jet off to America today. And don't be deceived about the bigger picture. This is, I believe, also a political resignation as well as a personal one. Kelly is a quiet critic of Brown's leadership. She has spoken out in cabinet against some of his political instincts. She has long been counted in the numbers of those who might resign if a coordinated revolt against Brown ever got off the ground (something her departure may accelerate). The personal things matter, of course, and Kelly's Catholicism is unquestionably at odds with the government's <a href=\"http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Legislation/Actsandbills/DH_080211\">human fertilisation and embryology bill</a> too (the same was true for Cairns). But in the end she is also going because she is fed up. If things were going better for Labour, or if she felt more at ease with the government's direction under Brown, one senses she would find a way to stay.</p> <p>And, yes, it's also another woman gone. First Siobhain MacDonagh, then Joan Ryan, then Fiona Mactaggart. Now Ruth Kelly. It may not be a plot, but increasingly it doesn't look entirely like a coincidence either. To say that Brown alienates Labour women is to put it too crudely, especially on the morning after the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/23/gordonbrown.labourconference2\">Sarah Brown moment</a>, but Sarah was needed yesterday for a reason, to make the Great Leader seem warmer and more human. His style of politics is not uniquely macho, but it is very, very male indeed. He struggles \u2013 certainly in public \u2013 to be frank, or honest, or emotionally aware in a way that makes male and female voters identify with him. In that sense, Kelly's departure strips a bit more of something important, but elusive, from Brown's standing.</p> <p>You can almost hear David Cameron's voice as he taunts Brown about the drip-drip of departures from his government and about the fact that Kelly gave him something like nine hours of good post-speech publicity before her story broke in the early hours. Another relaunch that ran out of gas within the space of a single news cycle. Kelly's resignation is a reminder that what was true before Brown's well-received speech is also true after it. The speech has not changed the game. The game goes on as before, though where it is headed no one can say. Yet always remember too that, in the end, the Pope easily outlasted Stalin.</p>",
  "<p>The Ben Stiller action comedy Tropic Thunder has taken the top spot at the UK box office with an explosive <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/boxoffice/?region=uk\">\u00a32.4m in its first week of release</a>.</p> <p>The film, which stars Stiller, Robert Downey Jr and Jack Black as pampered Hollywood actors who unwittingly find themselves in a real battle while shooting a Vietnam war drama, easily outgunned the No 2 film, the Abba musical Mamma Mia!

  "<p><strong>10.40am</strong> The start of the relegation battle at Hove between Sussex and Yorkshire has been delayed by rain, <em>writes a disconsolate Lawrence Booth</em>. The groundsmen are mopping up as I whinge and the greyest of the clouds may be heading away, so these could be decent bowling conditions once play gets under way. </p> <p>Chris Adams, in his final game as Sussex captain, has won the toss and has invited Yorkshire to bat. There's no Michael Vaughan (his intercostal niggle has failed to clear up) and no Jonathan Bairstow, who had been touted for a first-class debut behind the stumps. Yorkshire, remember, trail Sussex \u2013 champions in three of the last five seasons \u2013 by four points: the more bad weather, the happier the home side will be.</p> <p><strong>11.05am</strong> Good morning from Taunton, where we look set for a full day's play, but Somerset have already suffered a serious set-back to their championship aspirations, <em>reports Richard Rae</em>. Namely, they lost the toss. </p> <p>Not surprisingly, they were put in - the groundsman was clearly instructed to prepare a result wicket, and it's very, very green - and they've already lost Marcus Trescothick and Justin Langer. Trescothick was caught at second slip by Law off Newby's third ball - he was aiming through midwicket, which gives you a fair idea of how much it must have moved - and Langer was caught behind driving without any conviction at all at Glenn Chapple. </p> <p><strong>11.30am</strong> He is here, <em>writes David Hopps at Trent Bridge</em>. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/sep/24/countychampionship1stdivisioncricket.hampshire\">Hampshire's cloak-and-dagger operation to bring Imran Tahir back to England</a> for their championship decider against Nottinghamshire was finally revealed when the Pakistani leg-spinner - the inspiration of their season - appeared at Trent Bridge shortly before the start of the opening day.</p> <p>Imran's presence is bound to excite Hampshire into the belief that their championship challenge is still alive. They begin 18 points behind and it would be a tall order to recover that even if the leg-spinner was Shane Warne at the peak of his powers, but their success in persuading Nashau Titans to release Tahir for their final match of the season gives them a glimmer of a chance.</p> <p>Nottinghamshire have won the toss and put Hampshire in. Hampshire's aim must be to make 400, bowl out Nottinghamshire for less than 200, so giving them a chance of forcing a 22-3 victory. As the average first-innings score at Trent Bridge is under 250, that will take some batting effort. </p> <p>They have lost one wicket at the end of the first hour, Mark Ealham having Michael Brown caught behind for 29. They are 46-1 and even though it has not swung prodigiously it will take an innings of substance from somebody. Tahir, meanwhile, will be hoping that he has time for a lengthy nap.</p> <p><strong>11.45am</strong> Good morning from a damp and overcast Canterbury where play got under way 45 minutes late at 11.15am, <em>writes Paul Weaver</em>. I had a look at the pitch with Jack Birkenshaw, the pitches inspector, and umpires George Sharp and Neil Bainton when the covers came off at about 10.30am. There is some grass there and the general view is that it will do a bit. The Kent players think it's damp. A putting-in pitch, probably, and Durham, with the best pace attack in the land, decided to bowl when they won the toss.<br> The first over, bowled by Steve Harmison, was a torrid affair. Too torrid for Joe Denly. He was beaten by the first two deliveries and caught behind pushing at the third. Geraint Jones came in three.</p> <p>Since then Harmison and Callum Thorp \u2013 especially Thorp - have pitched too short and Jones, like many wicketkeepers, likes nothing better than cutting and pulling. He has raced to 25 and Kent are 31 for one after six overs.</p> <p>Despite the morning rain the forecast for the rest of the match is good. The crowd is poor, especially for a match of this importance, but the sun is fighting to come out now and it will probably fill up after lunch.</p> <p>There are some nerves about in the pavilion here. Kent have been beaten in two cup finals and after being in the running for the championship now face the possibility of relegation. </p> <p>That would be a terrible end to a season which promised much for a good side, one that bats very deep and has some pace in their attack, though Amjad Khan is not playing and has been replaced in the original line-up by Martin Saggers. I'm not certain whether Amjad is injured or simply not been selected at this stage.</p> <p><strong>Midday</strong> Yorkshire managed 26 for the loss of Adam Lyth, bowled by Jason Lewry for a duck, before the rain returned at Hove, <em>writes Lawrence Booth</em>. Only 45 deliveries have been possible so far, although Sussex \u2013 clinging on to a four-point lead over their relegation rivals \u2013 will be happier to see the weather. Another way of looking at it is that today could be ideal bowling conditions: skittle Yorkshire for under 200 and Sussex really ought to avoid relegation.</p> <p><strong>12.35pm</strong> At lunch here Kent are 81 for two after 19 overs, <em>writes Paul Weaver</em>. I think they would settle for that after losing the toss and being put in on a pitch that had a hint of dampness about it.</p> <p>Durham will be disappointed by how they bowled. Or they should be. Thorp, in particular, bowled too short. Kent lost their second wicket at 46 in the 11th over when Jones was lbw without playing a stroke. He got a good stride in but umpire Bainton raised his finger for the second time in the match.</p> <p>The wicket-taker was Mark Davies and it was only his second delivery after replacing Harmison.</p> <p><strong>12.50pm</strong> Life is going according to plan for Nottinghamshire, <em>writes David Hopps</em>. Hampshire are 83-4 at lunch - and that aim of reaching 400 to maintain their slim chances of stealing the championship at the last seems a forlorn hope. The way things are going we will be able to rule out Hampshire's championship challenge by tea - before Imran Tahir has even left the pavilion.</p> <p>Chris Read, Notts' captain, was unsure what to do upon winning the toss. \"Bat,\" he said upon observing a dry, cracked pitch. \"Ehm, no bowl,\" he corrected himself as he remembered that Notts have been winning matches by inserting the opposition all season.</p> <p>With Hampshire 46-0, Read might have had a creeping sense of unease. But the second hour of the morning belonged entirely to Nottinghamshire. Mark Ealham had Michael Brown caught at the wicket in his second over, there were two lbw decisions for Andre Adams, bowling around the wicket - Michael Lumb's leave-alone was an exasperating error - and the obdurate Michael Carberry, who had resisted for almost two hours for 23, was dislodged by Charlie Shreck with one that bounced, Read clutching a good catch to his left.</p> <p>Notts lost the Pro40 to Sussex on the last day of the tournament on this ground. There are no suggestions yet that the LV Championship will go the same way.</p> <p><strong>12.50pm</strong> The County Ground is a sombre place at lunch, <em>reports Richard Rae from Taunton</em>. Somerset are 94-5 and look unlikely to pick up a single batting bonus point, after James Hildreth, Zander De Bruyn and, perhaps crucially, the in-form Ian Blackwell followed Messrs Trescothick and Langer back to the pavilion. </p> <p>Hildreth was caught behind, trying to leave a Newby delivery that bounced a little more than he expected, DeBruyn's edged drive at Tom Smith was caught at slip by Paul Horton, and Blackwell got one that stopped on him and gave Smith an easy caught and bowled. </p> <p>The news from Trent Bridge hasn't lifted anybody's spirits either. Huge crowd here, by championship standards - at least a couple of thousand - and while all is far from lost, it doesn't look as though we're going to be here on Saturday.</p> <p><strong>2.20pm</strong> Just how much is a county entitled to mislead the media to improve its chances of winning the championship?, <em>asks David Hopps</em>. Hampshire have spent all week telling everyone who would listen that Imran Tahir was back in South Africa, a story backed up by the Titans coach, Richard Pybus. Tahir himself said as much. Even yesterday, in an interview for his column today for the Southampton Evening Echo, Nic Pothas continued the pretence that Tahir was still in South Africa. Fortunately for him, his ghost was beginning to suspect otherwise.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/sep/24/countychampionship1stdivisioncricket.hampshire\">The Guardian was the only media outlet to get wind yesterday</a> that Tahir was likely to make a shock appearance at Trent Bridge. But even we didn't imagine what now appears to be true: that Tahir never even left England, but has been hiding away all week as part of some huge con-trick.</p> <p>When does a justifiable game of bluff become a barefaced lie? If Notts win by an innings there will be a bit of laughter around Trent Bridge.</p> <p><strong>3.30pm</strong> Tea at Taunton finds Somerset still batting on 188-8, <em>reports Richard Rae</em>. Peter Trego, who was dropped by Paul Horton high to his left at first slip off Oliver Newby on 27, is now on 73, and together with Steffen Jones and now Andy Caddick, is guiding Zum towards a batting bonus point. That in itself is something of an irrelevance, but there's beginning to be a feeling Lancashire may have missed their opportunity. The wicket is flattening out - though the odd delivery continues to stop - and if Somerset can get something close to 250, they'll be reasonably happy.</p> <p><strong>3.30pm</strong> It's been an on-off day at Hove, <em>writes Lawrence Booth</em>, but the Sussex bowlers have taken the chance to keep their collective boot on Yorkshire's throat. When yet more bad light drove the players off at the end of another shortened session, Yorkshire were 57 for three from 24.3 overs and favourites for relegation. </p> <p>In the 17 overs possible after lunch, Andrew Gale was caught behind off Mohammad Sami for 31 as he threw the bat at a short one, before Anthony McGrath's torturous innings of three off 32 balls was ended when he prodded Robin Martin-Jenkins to Ollie Rayner at first slip. Eight points will be enough for Sussex to stay up \u2013 provided those points do not come in a defeat \u2013 but they will not even need as many as that if Yorkshire don't reach 400 (and fail to win). But I'm getting ahead of myself\u2026</p> <p><strong>4pm</strong> Nic Pothas' resistance has just been broken at Trent Bridge, <em>writes David Hopps</em>. He played on to Darren Pattinson for 44, a loose end to an otherwise disciplined innings. His stand with Dimi Mascerenhas was worth 55 and seems to have lasted most of my life. Hants are 151-6.</p> <p>Pothas, you may recall, is the man who told his Evening Echo ghost yesterday that Imran Tahir was in South Africa. It appears that at the time he was actually holed up in one of his flats on Southampton Marina. </p> <p>It seems that Pothas might not be the sharpest card in the pack. If Pothas' ghost had taken him at his word, the column bemoaning the fact that Tahir was in South Africa would have appeared in the Evening Echo around 10.30am this morning - just as Tahir was announced in the Hampshire side for Trent Bridge.</p> <p>Pothas would therefore have lied to make his own column wrong when everybody else knew the truth.</p> <p>'Tis a strange old world.</p> <p>Next week's Nic Pothas column: \"How I scored 400 to win the title for Hants.\"</p> <p><strong>4.15pm</strong> About 3.20pm here this afternoon Durham moved above Somerset and into second place in the county championship, <em>writes Paul Weaver in Canterbury</em>. That was the time when Robbie Joseph's defensive prod was defeated by Callum Thorp and Phil Mustard took a straightforward catch behind the wicket.</p> <p>It was Durham's third bowling point as Kent continued their late burst for relegation by losing their ninth wicket for 180 runs. It has been a miserable batting performance by Kent once again, albeit against some aggressive bowling from Steve Harmison on a pitch that does not look ideal for batting. There is a lot of seam movement.</p> <p>Having said that, why didn't Kent play on one of the pitches down the slope on the left of the square, as you look at it from the pavilion? They are generally flatter there and a draw would suit Kent very nicely. Now they are looking at a defeat.</p> <p>They have come off for a bad light-induced tea at 190-9 and only Rob Key (58) and Darren Stevens (41) have managed to improve on Geraint Jones' 25. This afternoon Kent lost five wickets for 16 runs in eight overs. Martin van Jaarsveld was third out at 81 in the first over after lunch, a leading edge to mid-off. Key and Stevens added 60 for the fourth wicket in 15 overs before the latter padded up to Ben Harmison and was lbw.</p> <p>Key was caught behind, pushing forward, Ryan McLaren, driving, was well caught by the keeper in front of first slip and Justin Kemp was seventh out at 150 when he was lbw to Steve Harmison, working to leg. Yasir Arafat cut Steve Harmison to gully and then Joseph was out. Durham look delighted. Obviously they haven't been following the score at Trent Bridge.</p> <p><strong>5.30pm</strong> That's it from here, <em>writes Paul Weaver at Canterbury</em>. Play has been called off for the day with Kent on 190-9. There has been no play since tea and 44 overs have been lost in the day. At least they haven't lost any ground to Notts. The umpires have been in and out, grimacing at the sky and shaking their heads in despair. But the forecast for the next two days is encouraging.</p>",

  "<p>The past two weeks of deepening financial turmoil have left mainland Europe on the sidelines. </p> <p>The gigantic bailouts of Wall Street institutions, the socialisation of vast tracts of the US economy and enforced US and British banking mergers have, in eurozone eyes, passed Europe by but rendered the dominant Anglo-Saxon economic model of the past quarter of a century kaput.</p> <p>The protagonists of modern Rhineland capitalism, Germany's centre-right chancellor, Angela Merkel, and her Social Democrat finance minister, Peer Steinbrueck, have delivered the same message.</p> <p>We warned the US and UK about the need to rein in runaway finance capital with greater regulation and transparency, they said, but were ignored.</p> <p>They and other leading eurozone players are refusing to take part in Washington's $700bn plan to acquire banks' toxic assets.</p> <p>It's not that continental Europeans feel immune from the fear and greed of Wall Street, or that they think the knock-on effects of the financial crisis on the real economy will be mitigated here, where every indicator points towards recession. </p> <p>And it's not that they believe individual banks won't be hit \u2013 think IKB/Sachsen LB in Germany and, above all, UBS in Switzerland.</p> <p>It's more that they feel their more tightly regulated, more consensus-driven economic model, derided by neo-liberals as sclerotic, yet recently reinvented, has been vindicated. </p> <p>Re-regulation and no more deregulation is the war cry - and MEPs this week voted by 562 to 86, with 25 abstentions, in favour of proposals for tougher oversight of and greater transparency among all financial players, including hedge funds and private equity firms.</p> <p>This is part of a wider European rethink of financial market regulation, which has been under way since the sub-prime crisis erupted and EU finance ministers adopted a regulatory \"roadmap\" last October.</p> <p>Nicolas Sarkozy, the French and current EU president, would like the adoption of a specifically pan-European system of cross-border supervision of banks and other financial players such as insurance groups. </p> <p>Christian Noyer, the Bank of France governor, favours giving a prime role to the European central bank.</p> <p>That's a sentiment echoed by centre-right MEPs such as the German Christian Democrat, Kurt Lauk, who says: \"The ongoing crisis of the banking sector shows that we can no longer rely on US standards, particularly since the American control systems failed substantially.\"</p> <p>In the next few weeks, Charlie McCreevy, the EU internal market commissioner and reluctant regulator, will set out European commission plans to revise the capital requirement directive, designed to improve the management of large-scale exposures, and to regulate credit rating agencies. </p> <p>He will also demand the speedier adoption of revised rules on how much capital reserves insurers should hold (Solvency II).</p> <p>There are three striking aspects to his proposals. Firstly, they rarely, if ever, get mentioned in the debate among British policymakers about how to respond to the crisis. </p> <p>In recent days, I have heard government ministers and opposition spokesmen such as the shadow chancellor, George Osborne, put them forward as their own, wilfully ignoring the longstanding EU dimension.</p> <p>Secondly, despite the scale of the majority vote in the European parliament, there is, in fact, no European consensus on how to proceed both in tackling the current crisis and laying down the regulatory framework for preventing future shocks. Lots of hue and cry, but no deal so far.</p> <p>Rating agencies have skilfully and intensely lobbied to expose gaps and inconsistencies in McCreevy's draft proposals. </p> <p>Big and small countries are at loggerheads over who should regulate the four dozen or so cross-border banking groups - the \"home\" regulator or the \"host\" supervisor. </p> <p>McCreevy sees hedge funds, private equity firms and sovereign wealth funds as saviours in Europe's recovery, but his political opponents want them savagely brought to heel (the funds are sanguine that they've taken the bite out of his plans).</p> <p>Thirdly, despite their schadenfreude about the woes of unbridled Anglo-Saxon capitalism, continental EU political leaders know that there will be no remedy without the Americans and the Brits (not forgetting the Asians).</p> <p>Any new regulatory system will have to meet global standards. A standalone EU system could simply lead to a flight of capital; Europe does not have the political or financial clout, let alone unity of purpose, to impose its will.</p> <p>So Sarkozy is proposing an emergency G8 meeting this autumn/winter to get a global deal - after the Europeans, probably, have floundered at their mid-October summit and the US has chosen a new president. It's an admission that even a weakened US still calls a lot of the shots.</p> <p><strong>Old habits die hard in the Rhineland</strong></p> <p>Rhineland capitalism may have been modernised through the euro and globalisation, but old habits die hard. </p> <p>This week, Merkel went to Wolfsburg, Volkswagen's home turf, and was greeted with roars of approval by more than 15,000 employees as though she was a union leader on the warpath.</p> <p>Accompanied by Bernd Osterloh, the works council leader and VW board member, and Felix Magath, the coach of the local Bundesliga football team, she reaffirmed the validity of the 1960 \"VW law\" that hands a blocking 20% minority vote to the state (Lower Saxony in this case) \u2013 and effectively told McCreevy (and Europe's highest court) where to get off.</p> <p>It's the latest act in the Wagnerian epic pitching Germany versus the EU - and, above all, Volkswagen against Porsche. </p> <p>The sports car maker Porsche owns just over 35% of VW (via ultra-modern financial transactions excoriated elsewhere by Merkel) and plans to take its much bigger partner/rival over by year end.</p> <p>The power play machinations around this takeover have seen the Porsche and Piech families that control Porsche in open warfare, with Wolfgang Porsche, the company's chairman, publicly denouncing Ferdinand Piech, VW's chairman and a big Porsche shareholder.</p> <p>Osterloh has taken Wendelin Wiedeking, Porsche's chief executive, to court over the latter's plans to cut the VW unions' seats on the merged group's supervisory board. Osterloh backs the VW law, but Wiedeking wants the EU to lay it to rest.</p> <p>Beyond the clashing of gigantic egos and political manoeuvrings, there is a simple fact: as Europe's largest carmaker, VW should be like any other modern listed European firm in an open ownership structure. </p> <p>But, for Merkel, the postwar German economic model is unassailable: \"This is about securing the future shape of Germany. And we need motivated workers for Project Germany.\"</p>",
  "<p>Pupils in two areas of the country will be offered free school meals in pilots of a scheme which, if proved to make a marked difference to pupils' health and concentration, could be expanded nationwide, ministers announced today.</p> <p>Alan Johnson, the health secretary, set out plans for the \u00a320m experiment to provide every child with free school meals in two local authorities. In a third area the proportion who qualify will be expanded on a means-tested basis. Currently around 14% of pupils get free school meals.</p> <p>If the scheme is proved to improve health, standards at school, pupils behaviour and take-up of school meals it could be expanded to every local authority. Around 18% of two-to-five-year-olds are classed as obese and a further 14% are overweight. Studies show that healthy meals improve pupils' behaviour in class.</p> <p>This follows the Jamie Oliver-inspired school dinner revolution, which saw the government introduce minimum standards for school lunches under pressure from the popular campaign run by the TV chef. But evaluations of that scheme by Ofsted has shown that in many schools the changes turned pupils off school dinners, with many opting for less healthy school lunch boxes or buying their lunch from shops.</p> <p>Councils will be invited to bid to take part in the scheme. Some local authorities have already experimented with free school dinners and in Scotland the idea of introducing free dinners at infant schools is currently under consideration.</p> <p>Today's announcement of a \u00a320m initiative, jointly between the Department of Health, local authorities, and the Department for Children, Schools and Families, will look at whether free school dinners improve pupils' health and concentration in schools. It comes amid concerns about rising food costs impacting on the poorest families and ongoing worries that the current system of free school meals labels some children in a way which can make them vulnerable to bullying.</p> <p>Hull city council, one of the most disadvantaged areas in the country, introduced free school breakfasts, lunches and dinners for a number of years but when the council switched from Labour control to Liberal Democrat it was scrapped. There were criticisms that it was not rigorously evaluated.</p> <p>In January Ball and Johnson launched a \u00a3372m cross-government strategy to encourage families to lead healthier lives. It aimed to support the creation of a healthier society \u2013 from early years to schools and food, from sport and physical activity to planning, transport and the health service. Cooking was made a compulsory part of the national curriculum.</p> <p>The Foresight report on obesity published last year indicated that on current trends nearly 60% of the British population would be obese by 2050.</p> <p>Johnson announced the scheme on a visit to a primary school in Bolton, north-west of Manchester, on a trip coinciding with Labour's conference.</p>",
  "<p>I was 15 when I got my first gun, a 16-gauge shotgun for hunting. When I was 19, I had three shotguns and a rifle. All were legal.</p> <p>It is possible, in Finland, to get a licence for a gun when you are 15. You need approval from your parents, of course, but I had no problem at all with that. Both my parents were \u2013 and still are \u2013 keen hunters.</p> <p>I applied for a licence for a handgun too. The police told me that I would need to join a shooting club first. I did not bother.</p> <p>There are currently more than 800,000 licensed guns in Finland. The vast majority are for hunting, something of a Finnish national sport, but the number of handguns has been rising steadily over the past few years. The police issue more than 60,000 new gun purchase licences every year, many of them to people who already own guns. And until last year, all these guns caused very few real problems.</p> <p>According to the official statistics, 45 people in Finland were killed by knives in 2006, and 10 by guns. Not one single person was killed by a minor with a licensed gun. You could \u2013 in fact, you still can \u2013 claim that issuing licences for hunting guns to minors is not a security risk.</p> <p>Then on November 7, 2007, an 18-year-old schoolboy <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2007/nov/12/schools.uk\">shot dead</a> eight victims and himself with a licensed 22-calibre pistol. He had been issued the licence for the gun just a few months earlier. In the wake of that tragedy, the police were given new guidelines for issuing licences to buy and carry a gun.</p> <p>This week, in Kauhajoki, a 22-year-old student <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/24/finland.schoolsworldwide\">killed 10 people and himself</a> with a licensed 22-calibre pistol. He had been issued the licence in August. On Monday, he had been interviewed by the police because he had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2008/sep/23/finnish.shootings\">uploaded some shooting videos to the internet</a>. Despite that, his licence was not cancelled.</p> <p>It would seem that the new guidelines made very little difference. The prime minister, Matti Vanhanen, has already announced that Finland's gun laws will now be changed. No details have yet been given, but it is quite easy to predict the outcome: it will become very difficult indeed to get a licence for a hand gun. Getting a licence for a shotgun or rifle for hunting will also become harder. There will also be pressure from other European countries to set the minimum age for a gun licence to 18.</p> <p>Everything else, I predict, will be accepted in Finland quite easily. But the idea of making hunting impossible for youngsters over 15, but under 18, will not go down well at all. Other countries may find it insane, but 15-year-olds have always had access to guns in Finland. It is part of Finnish culture, and it has never caused us any problems. There is no link between hunting and murder. Neither of the young murderers had a hunting background. Both, moreover, were old enough to get a licence without parental consent.</p> <p>Hunting is an extremely popular hobby in Finland and it will and should remain so, despite these dreadful massacres. I think this way, and so do the vast majority of Finns. And no, I do not have a vested interest here: I gave up hunting when I was 20. It was, at the end of the day, rather boring.</p>",
  "<p><strong>The latest in our series of classic reports come from this week in September 1988. On the 24th, Ben Johnson became the fastest man in history, breaking the world record on his way to Olympic 100m gold. Three days later, on the 27th, he was stripped of his title after being found guilty of doping. The speed of the switch in fortunes and the distance between the highs and lows Johnson went through in that week meant there has never been a story quite like it. Frank Keating, the revered sports writer, was in Seoul to cover it all for the Guardian. The first of these two pieces was published on the 25th, the day after Johnson had become one of the most famous athletes on the planet. The second was published on the 28th, the day after he'd become one of the most infamous in history. </strong></p> <p><strong>Johnson plays hare to Lewis's rabbit</strong></p> <p>Ben Johnson's astonishing kick-start technique at the gun \u2014 his coiled upper body seemingly able to catapult him away while his feet still remain on the electronic sensors of the block-pads \u2014 again ensured he had the world record in his pocket before he had completed a tenth of his 48 strides.</p> <p>It left the yappy Carl Lewis almost lost for words. But only almost. At least the voluble Lewis makes up for the champion's introspection. \"I let my feet do the talking,\" muttered the only man in the century to have broken his own 100 metres record. Fastest, you might say, to even faster \u2014 which gives him one heck of a pair of eloquently loquacious feet.</p> <p>It was a thrill to be there. In fact, Johnson's reaction time out of the blocks, 0.132sec, was 0.002sec slower than his jack-rabbit flier in Rome last year \u2014 but this time it was just as murderous to Lewis's spirit. Johnson was a metre up after 15, three up at 40, and four at 65.</p> <p>Immediately afterwards, Lewis said he had not bothered about Johnson \u2014 he just concentrated on his own race and performance, \"looking straight ahead\". Which was a fib, for three times his popping eyes had rolled right \u2014 and what he saw had made his mouth dry, for each time his tongue flicked across his lips like a chameleon under pressure.</p> <p>What Lewis certainly did not see was Johnson's mouth curling into a wicked and satisfyingly vengeful grin as he crossed the line at, said the clock, just under 27mph.</p> <p>Lewis had also run, it must not be forgotten, a stupendous race. He is a remarkable athlete. Scarcely had he got his shoe off the accelerator, however, than he started putting his foot in it.</p> <p>Still at the trackside, he gave what could only be interpreted as his pre-planned victory speech, all about his beloved father who died last year: \"My mother had a dream two nights ago, and my daddy appeared to her and all three of us were together again, and daddy told my mother that his little Carl was going to be all right on The Day, everything was going to be all right for Carl.\"</p> <p>A couple of hours later, showered, shampooed and laden with aftershave, Lewis for a moment looked as though he was going to bury the hatchet and give absolute best with a gracious chivalry. \"Yes, of course I shook Ben Johnson's hand before and after the race,\" he said with solemn earnestness \u2014 and then totally ruined it by adding, \"but I do that to everyone I ever race against, don't I?\"</p> <p>Johnson's feet having talked at 19 to the dozen, gabbing had little appeal. \"I felt good,\" he said. \"The race was won in the first 30 metres and I just took it from there.\" He was 14 when his mother took the five kids from Jamaica to friends in Toronto \u2014 her crucial need to find work only too obvious, for her first job began on day two of landing. She went straight to the airport hotel and signed on as a chambermaid.</p> <p>By 1977, Ben, at 16, began to hang around a township gymnasium run by Charlie Francis, who specialised in athletics. He is still Johnson's coach. Suddenly, Ben Johnson \u2014 whose chronic childhood stutter had become even worse in his first years in Canada \u2014 had discovered a way for his feet to do all his talking for him.</p> <p><strong>New era begins with a chilly dawn</strong></p> <p>I do not know how many Olympic competitors say their prayers night and <br>morning as a matter of course, but I bet a heck of a lot more than usual woke up to Seoul's chilly grey dawn yesterday and, with a shiver, offered thanks: \"There but for the grace of God go I.\"</p> <p>Ben Johnson is taking the rap for a pretty large army. Even the most conservative pre-Games estimates admitted a substantial group of athletes were taking performance-enhancing drugs. The president of the International Olympic Committee medical commission guessed 6% \u2014 that is over 500 of those who woke up in the Olympic Village here yesterday.</p> <p>Last month, when presenting the official report of the committee of inquiry into drug abuse in British athletics \u2014 commissioned by the British Amateur Athletic Board and the Amateur Athletic Association \u2014 even the chairman, Peter Coni QC, had to concede, when asked about the prevalence of drug-taking among today's athletes, that \"it would be a brave man who said that one in 10 was not a possibility\".</p> <p>So in a British team here of 96 athletes, officialdom reckons 10 of them may be doped up \u2014 and Coni's brief, of course, took in none of the other Olympic sports where this pathetic pill-popping is even more prevalent.</p> <p>It is a special thrill to witness a world-record run \u2014 and particularly so in the breathtaking short sprint because, stripped of tactics or intellect, you have before you the very basic proof that no one in the history of mankind has run faster. Well, all right, if you must, since the stopwatch was invented last century.</p> <p>Even if your great-grand-children prefer piano playing to sports, they will be mighty impressed that grandpop actually witnessed a bloke being the very fastest man in the history of the universe.</p> <p>In Johnson's case, twice in 13 months, for on Saturday in Seoul the Jamaican-born Canadian became the only man in history to break his own world record at the 100m dash. So, perhaps, we should have been suspicious \u2014 as indeed we were. But excitement of the moment readily files conjecture to the back of your mind and submerges cynical suspicion.</p> <p>But what do we tell our grandchildren now? Wide-eyed innocents on your knee should not have to ask why Stanozolol makes a man run faster.</p> <p>Johnson now forfeits his new record \u2014 but his old one of 9.83, set in Rome last year, will stand, for he was not officially nabbed for any illegality then. So for how many years will the new kids to the sport be chasing a tainted record?</p> <p>Will they grow up to know only that to break sport's classic barrier you have to be abusing yourself? Unless the authorities really have broken through with a new and highly sensitive testing kit \u2014 and unless Johnson, as he claims, was nobbled \u2014 then the now former champion or his advisers must have been astonishingly lax at not coming off the drug in time or not using a \"masking agent\" to hide its use in the bloodstream.</p> <p>Johnson's performances in the last couple of years have, after all, been such to make him the rumour-mongers' prime suspect \u2014 especially those who knew him as a skinny medium-pacer of a few years back.</p> <p>Even the NBC commentator for the programme beamed to the US forces out here was a touch near the knuckle during Saturday's race \u2014 \"Wow. He had another gear there that we didn't even see in Rome when he broke the record. The man's incredible.\"</p> <p>And later, on NBC again, Johnson's fierce rival, the American Carl Lewis, who was second on Saturday, brazenly told his interviewer: \"He just wasn't the same person he was yesterday (in the qualifying heats). I don't know how he did it. He must have been hypnotised or something, but he did something to stimulate himself in the final.\"</p> <p>Lewis was also quivering with innuendo in Rome, after which he called a press conference to complain about drugs wrecking his sport. He did not exactly name his great rival, but he was miffed to say the least, telling how Johnson had been an insignificant rival all through the early 1980s (both men are 27), running about 10.1 or 10.2 for the distance until 1985.</p> <p>Then Lewis had 1986 off for a knee operation, and when he returned \"I saw old Ben suddenly running better than anyone else; he didn't look the same and he certainly didn't run the same\".</p> <p>Poor old fast-footed, slow-witted Ben, carrying the can for his greedy little cadre of \"advisers\" \u2014 as well as for those cheats, who must be numbered in tens of thousands, who call themselves athletes from all over the world, east and west.</p> <p>But a sad and sorry day for the Olympic Games and for sport? Not a bit of it. Just like the nippy, milky-white dawn that lay over our village compound, brightened up with a fierce sun as the story, too, got hotter, so with a bit of luck and even more vigilance might September 27 1988 turn out to be a glistening day, full of light and hope, for honest sport.</p>",

He used a handgun and petrol bombs on his fellow pupils at a vocational college in Kauhajoki town, then fatally shot himself in the head.</p> <p>Police said the dead were eight female students, a male student and a male teacher. Another female student was wounded.</p> <p>Some of the dead were badly burned by fires Saari started, making identification difficult.</p> <p>Vanhanen said he was \"very critical about the guns and during the next few months we will make a decision about it\".</p> <p>Today has been declared a day of mourning in Finland. The country's main national daily newspaper, Helsingin Sanomat, replaced its usual front-page advertisement with a large picture of a woman placing a candle at a memorial in front of the school. Above a picture of the gunman ran the headline \"Why?\"</p> <p>The massacre, and a similar one last year, have led to calls for a review of gun laws.</p> <p>Finland, a nation with a deep-rooted hunting tradition, ranks in the top five in the world for civilian gun ownership. There are roughly 1.6 million firearms in private hands in a population of about 5 million.</p> <p>\"We must considerably tighten [gun controls],\" Vanhanen said. \"We should consider whether to allow these small arms for private citizens at home. They belong on firing ranges.\"</p> <p>The government has called for an investigation of how police handled the case. The gunman was questioned by police on Monday about YouTube videos in which he was seen firing his gun. In the videos he pointed his gun to the camera and said \"You will die next\" before firing.</p> <p>Police said they released him because he had not broken the law and they did not deem him a threat to others.</p> <p>The interior minister, Anne Holmlund, said: \"It's clear that we have to carefully go through what should have been done and if we could have avoided this situation in some way.\"</p> <p>Police said Saari left two handwritten messages that he had planned the attack since 2002 and hated the human race.</p> <p>Last year, a Finnish 18-year-old killed eight pupils and himself. Both he and Saari had posted violent clips on YouTube, were fascinated by the 1999 Columbine school shootings in Colorado, attacked their own schools, and died after shooting themselves in the head.</p>",
  "<p>Death and taxes are said to be the two great inescapables of life, and sometimes the implication is assumed to be that they are the only two worth mentioning when one is marshalling enough stoicism to breast life's vicissitudes. But there are others, some positive: I think kindness or fellow-feeling is far more common among human beings than cruelty, as proved by the normal daily functioning of society, and I think \u2013 quite consistently \u2013 that selfishness and its even less appealing manifestation as greed is more common than sentiments of social responsibility when it comes to attitudes towards anonymous others, as proved by hedge fund managers.</p> <p>These latter borrow shares, currencies or contracts, sell them cheap to push down their value, buy them back at the bargain-basement price they have forced them to, and return them to their owners with a nice fat profit in their own pockets. Suppose they do this with bank shares. The bank's share value plummets, depositors panic and withdraw their money, credit rating agencies lower the bank's standing which means that it has to borrow money at higher and higher interest to cover its obligations. As a result it begins to teeter. Depositors might lose some of their money, any form of rescue will mean job losses from the bank's staff, people seeking mortgages to buy a home or loans to start up a small business find credit harder to get and eventually impossible ... and the hedge fund managers light their cigars and laugh over their drinks at the wine bar. </p> <p>Such forms of capitalist activity as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/23/marketturmoil.regulators\">short-selling</a> and other techniques to make money out of money \u2013 conducted by the high-end barrow-boys hunting and pouncing around financial institutions to graze upon, exploit, finesse, manipulate, and ultimately profit from the money transactions going on above the level of the \"real\" economy \u2013 are said to be vital to the \"real\" economy, and in many ways this is true. For one thing City profits are a major component of the UK's standing as one of the world's wealthiest countries (and therefore the City's activities are very much part of the \"real\" economy). For another, the money generated does not all go on imported luxury goods, thus benefiting someone else's economy, but oils the wheels of the rest of our own economy through investment and credit facilities.</p> <p>At the same time, though, some of this activity really does have a big downside, and we are seeing it now. The money men resist government attempts at regulation and oversight, they are endlessly inventive in the ways they can make money out of money and the movement of money, creating tradable \"assets\" \u2013 even out of dodgy debts, as we see with the cancer at the heart of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/23/wallstreet.marketturmoil1\">current crisis</a>: subprime mortgages in the US \u2013 and artificially manipulating the financial marketplace for short-term gain, as in short-selling. The good that the market can do in being an open arena of trade and opportunity is thus threatened by the vices of its virtues.</p> <p>There is no surprise in the fact that the current rot started on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/wallstreet\">Wall Street</a>, because American capitalism is much less regulated than European capitalism. The lesson learned from the Great Depression of the early 1930s is that governments and central banks cannot stand by and let everything fall to pieces. So we are seeing central banks pump billions of dollars into the financial system to maintain availability of credit for its institutions, we see nationalisations (even by the US government: a whole New Deal) and abrogation of competitiveness legislation \u2013 in short we see action that should theoretically be the very opposite of capitalism, the very opposite of reliance on \"the wisdom of the markets\", to save our skins.</p> <p>A nice reckoning is afoot here. The paladins who resisted the state's interference in their money markets have proved unable to manage them well without the state's help. But the state cannot go too far in sitting on the goose that, in good times, lays golden eggs. It has to find a way of limiting the goose's more noisome efflations while keeping the eggs coming \u2013 a finger in the right dyke, so to say \u2013 and that is a delicate matter. Over-correction in the regulatory direction might do opposite harms; yet the robber-baron mentality of speculators cannot be allowed to destabilise the entire economy on the grounds that nothing but the profit motive counts.</p> <p>One place to start is with those short-selling hedge-fund activities. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/sep/22/shares.hbosbusiness\">Financial Services Authority</a> has now banned short-selling for four months. This is an admission that this part of the reason for present woes is a sharp practice. For consider: these activities amount to gambling on a certainty. With central banks and governments loth to let a bank go under, the cowboys can manipulate matters knowing that they are in no danger whatever of losing out, though lots of other people will do so \u2013 and, in the end, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/23/marketturmoil.creditcrunch\">mainly the taxpayer</a>. They know, in effect, that at the limit they can put their hands in your pocket and mine and help themselves to our cash: their own pockets are absolutely safe. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/22/alistairdarling.taxandspending\">Alistair Darling says</a> that the short-selling ban is temporary because in normal times the technique is acceptable and indeed useful for providing liquidity and funds for investment. But at the moment it is seriously damaging and irresponsible; and this moment is always waiting to repeat if the reckless push to maximise profits overrides all other considerations, not least among them stability. </p> <p>Whatever new framework emerges from this mess, that and other potentially wrecking practices will have to come under the sort of control that will stop them being such a sure bet against the rest of us. The only thing that prevents greed is a guaranteed danger of burning your fingers to the knuckle if you go too far. One simple idea: taxes on profits from short-selling should be very high to start and rapidly incremental thereafter. That makes the greed motive work against itself, since profit maximising is the chief, if not the only, prompt for action in the financial markets.</p> <p>Such a provision might, for example, have made the raiders on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/hbosbusiness\">Halifax Bank of Scotland</a> go homeward tae think again. But I'll bet \u2013 another safe bet \u2013 that the paladins in striped suits will try to talk the FSA and Treasury out of making any such provision.</p>",
  "<p>The FBI is investigating four Wall Street institutions at the heart of the financial crisis over their role in the sub-prime mortgage meltdown, it emerged today.</p> <p>Reports said preliminary investigations into potential corporate fraud at the US mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the insurer American International Group and the investment bank Lehman Brothers had been opened. </p> <p>They are among 26 companies being scrutinised by the FBI. Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae and AIG were bailed out by the government in the last fortnight, while Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy.</p> <p>Senior executives at the companies are also believed to be in the FBI's sights, while the securities and exchange commission is also reportedly assessing possible civil fraud claims against the four firms.</p> <p>\"The FBI continues to investigate a number of companies for sub-prime lending practices, but the department brings criminal prosecutions based solely on the facts and the law,\" Brian Roehrkasse, a Justice Department spokesman, said.</p> <p>\"Where we find evidence of criminal wrongdoing, we will prosecute.\"</p> <p>Several California institutions, including IndyMac Bank of Pasadena, which collapsed in July at a cost of $8.9bn (\u00a34.7bn), are reported to be under investigation.</p> <p>Countrywide, formerly the largest mortgage lender in the US and now owned by Bank of America, is also under scrutiny.</p> <p>The investigations come as Congress <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/24/wallstreet.georgebush\">considers a $700bn bailout package</a> for the financial industry. </p> <p>The Bush administration's plan would allow the Treasury to buy toxic bad debts from troubled financial institutions.</p> <p>Congressmen yesterday demanded safeguards, additional details and more time to scrutinise the way in which the Treasury intends to spend the money.</p> <p>In the past two weeks, the government has taken over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to prevent their collapse. </p> <p>Last week, the Federal Reserve provided an emergency $85bn loan to AIG to save it from bankruptcy, but refused to bail out Lehman Brothers. </p> <p>Eight months ago, the FBI <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jan/30/subprimecrisis.creditcrunch\">began an investigation into the sub-prime mortgage market</a>, in which loans were given to people who were not in a position to repay them. </p> <p>This prompted the credit crunch as bad debts were bundled together with higher quality assets and sold on by banks.</p> <p>The FBI is known to have demanded information from Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and - prior to its collapse - Bear Stearns.</p> <p>In June, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jun/20/corporatefraud.banking\">two Bear Stearns executives were arrested</a> over charges that they misled investors as the subprime market began to disintegrate.</p>",

Daniel Craig and Olga Kurylenko in Quantum of Solace</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On Monday we brought you <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2008/sep/22/1\">Daniel Craig's responses to questions posed by guardian.co.uk/film readers</a> about the new Bond film, Quantum of Solace, which hits cinemas here on Halloween, Friday, October 31. Today it's the turn of director Marc Forster to answer your questions.</p> <p>You may have read today about <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2008/sep/23/jamesbond\">Forster's revelation that his Bond will be shortest 007 adventure ever</a>, at just over 100 minutes. The various questions put to Craig and Forster by fans from sites around the world brought a lot more details from Quantum of Solace into the spotlight, and I've picked out a few of the more interesting responses below. But first, those questions for Forster.<br><br><strong>Question:</strong> I found the attempt, in the New Casino Royale, to ground Bond in current norms and perceptions (Post Bourne and post Abu Ghraib) very disturbing, and this was something I liked about the film, even if it was uncomfortable. Did you find this new take on Bond disturbing, and did it make you re-assess your own feelings about the character? (<strong>From TaghioffDaniel</strong>)</p> <p><strong>Marc Forster:</strong> Casino Royale is why I was interested in making Quantum Solace and getting involved with Bond. I think Daniel's interpretation really grounded Bond back in reality and in a human sphere which I was able to connect with. I felt at the end of Casino Royale Bond was in a very vulnerable state and it was the perfect opportunity to lead the character into new territory. </p> <p><strong>Question:</strong> I've recently (and late I realise) got into Fleming's books. Do you think Fleming's source Bond would survive the cut in our modern politically correct times? (<strong>From Hoisin</strong>)</p> <p><strong>Marc Forster:</strong> I don't think if Ian Fleming wrote today it would have the same impact. I think at the time Britain almost needed Bond as a saviour, and Fleming's novels gave them that. The role of women has changed and I think that type of character would be such a sexist these days that people would highly criticise a character like that.</p> <p>During questions from fans around the world, Forster also revealed that he had tried to inject some of the series' traditional humour back into the franchise, without moving it too far from Casino Royale's take on things. \"Yes, there is humour,\" he said. \"I think it's important with Bond in general not to take yourself too seriously, but it's a very sensitive balance.\"</p> <p>In terms of gadgets, Forster said they did make some sort of appearance on QOS, although on a low key level. \"I feel like gadgets sort of lose a bit of their power in this day and age because we all have so many gadgets ourselves,\" he said. </p> <p>Talking about his cast, Forster revealed that the character played by Olga Kurylenko, Camille, was intended to be a \"mirror image\" of Bond. \"I don't think one ever wants Bond to talk openly about his emotional feelings, because it wouldn't be right because there's still this hard shell of this tough man,\" he said. \"[But] she is very similar to Bond and speaks the words Bond sometimes would like to speak.\"</p> <p>Forster said he had created more time in the script for M, played by Judi Dench. \"I thought that relationship between M and Bond was really interesting,\" he said. \"It's an interesting relationship because M is the only woman in Bond's life who he basically doesn't have a sexual interest in.\" </p> <p>Finally, Forster said he would not be returning for a third Daniel Craig Bond, as he wanted to work on smaller projects. Producer Barbara Brocolli, who sat in on the Craig round table, said Quantum of Solace would finish the story begun in Casino Royale, with the next film telling a new story from scratch. There was every indication that Craig would be returning for \"Bond 23\".</p> <p>Meanwhile, Craig, who was sporting a complicated contraption on one arm, apparently following surgery for a long-term injury, talked about working with Mathieu Amalric, who plays evil faux environmentalist Dominic Greene, describing the Frenchman as a \"wonderful actor\", who brought something \"sick and twisted\" to the role. </p> <p>He revealed that he had played a greater part in the creative process this time around, with himself and Forster regularly meeting to work on the script before shooting the various strands of the film. And talking about his character, he said he had no qualms with the fact that Bond, as a \"military man\" was a bit of a \"bastard\", but was pleased that his relationship with M meant that he was capable of taking a \"smack on the wrist\" from a woman, and could not therefore \"be that misogynistic\".</p> <p>Finally, Craig revealed the reason why he does his own stunts. \"If at that moment you go oh fuck me it's them, it's just a little bit of extra excitement that you can add into a movie,\" he said. \"The more I'm involved with it the more I can hopefully put a reality into that, into that situation. And I get a kick out of it. I mean it makes the heart beat faster.\"</p> <p>That's it for now. On Thursday, we'll be posting a gallery of exclusive images from Quantum of Solace. Hopefully all this coverage isn't proving Bond overload and is whetting your appetite for what's to come. Will the new film live up to the high standard of Casino Royale? Let us know what you think below.</p>",
  "<p>When Ruth Kelly was elected to parliament in May 1997, as one of the army of \"Blair babes\" swept in by the Labour landslide, few people would have predicted that she would have become the youngest woman to sit in a British cabinet.</p> <p>Although clearly very able, she was also heavily pregnant, and she gave birth to her first child just 11 days after polling day.</p> <p>At the time, after 18 years of Conservative government, there were few precedents for women wanting to combine bringing up very young children with a career at the top of government.</p> <p>But Kelly, along with other ministers like Yvette Cooper, has transformed perceptions about what is possible for women in parliament. Now a mother of four, she first became a minister in 2001 and she has now spent almost four years in cabinet.</p> <p>When Tony Blair took the surprise decision to make her education secretary in 2004, she was only 36. It was an astonishing promotion that saw her leapfrogging other members of the 1997 and 2001 intake who had been expected to reach cabinet before her.</p> <p>But, in retrospect, Blair's decision probably damaged her prospects in the long-term. Many MPs felt that she had been over-promoted, since then she has twice been moved sideways in cabinet reshuffles and there was speculation that, if she had not decided to quit, Gordon Brown could have decided to sack anyway.</p> <p>With her majority in Bolton West just 2,064 over the Tories, she also faces the likely prospect of losing her seat at the next election. The chances of a political comeback seem slim.</p> <p>Although she worked as a junior Treasury minister under Brown, Kelly managed to stay loyal to Brown and Blair at the same time and in her speech to the Labour conference this morning she paid tribute to both men.</p> <p>In a moving opening, she also acknowledged that, although she has managed to combine motherhood with a ministerial job for seven years, it has not been easy.</p> <p>\"I am also proud to have been a mother and a wife and, to have been able to do this job, I have relied on the support of my husband and my father,\" she said.</p> <p>\"I ask for your understanding when I say I owe it to my children and my family to take a step back. If I do not, I know it's something I will come to regret.\"</p> <p>Kelly has had to cope with her fair share of political landmines. As education secretary she was condemned by teaching unions for rejecting proposals to replace GCSEs and A-levels with a new diploma.</p> <p>She also came under pressure during her tenure at the Department for Education when it emerged some sex offenders were working in schools.</p> <p>Her choice of a \u00a315,000-a-year private school in Oxfordshire for her dyslexic son also dismayed many in the Labour party.</p> <p>As communities secretary, Kelly was the unfortunate minister in charge of home information packs (Hips) for house sales when - after more than a decade in the making - the policy had to be postponed due to a lack of proper planning.</p> <p>When Gordon Brown took over as prime minister, it had been predicted this fiasco might spell the end of her career. But she kept her position in the cabinet, and was made transport secretary.</p> <p>She drew widespread praise for bringing up four young children while developing her career. Yet despite her loyalty, intellect and frequently stated passion for \"social justice\", there remained a sense among the Labour party she was something of a misfit, perhaps due to her apolitical background and devout Catholicism.</p> <p>Born of Catholic parents in Northern Ireland, she attended three independent schools in England: Edgarley Hall; Sutton high school, where she took her O-levels; and Westminster, one of the country's most prestigious public schools, as a boarder and (as at Edgarley) the holder of a scholarship. She read politics, philosophy and economics at Queen's College, Oxford, then gained an MSc at the London School of Economics.</p> <p>At 22 she joined the Guardian as an economics writer but moved after four years to become deputy head of the inflation report division at the Bank of England.</p> <p>Former colleagues recall an enormously clever, not terribly political young woman; when she left for the Bank of England - not the natural habitat of a classic activist - few predicted a political future.</p> <p>Yet in her short Westminster career, Kelly was being tipped to become Britain's first female chancellor.</p> <p>She married Derek Gadd, a local government officer, in 1996. The couple live in a modest house in Shadwell, Tower Hamlets, during the week, and have a home in her Bolton West constituency in Lancashire.</p> <p>In 1998 she became parliamentary aide to Nick Brown, the agriculture minister and a key ally of the chancellor. She then joined the Treasury as economic secretary and later financial secretary, gaining the distinction of being regarded as a Brownite popular with Blairites.</p> <p>But her strict Catholicism - she is said to be a member of the Opus Dei sect - has affected her political career.</p> <p>Kelly rejected calls to break off her links with the group or quit, saying: \"It is a private spiritual life and I don't think it is relevant to my job. I am here as a Catholic.\"</p> <p>She refused to work at the Department of Health because of her beliefs on abortion, while the Department for International Development was ruled out because it promotes the use of condoms to prevent the spread of HIV and Aids.</p> <p>After a short spell at the Cabinet Office she became education secretary when David Blunkett's resignation resulted in Charles Clarke's promotion to the Home Office.</p> <p>Tony Blair believed she could speak parents' language in the run-up to the 2005 election, and present government policy in more emollient tones.</p> <p>But she never quite shook off the view in the education establishment that she had been over-promoted, and there were grumblings from the same quarter when she immediately diluted the government's response to the Tomlinson report on 14-19 education, which ministers had promoted enthusiastically before her appointment.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Archant</strong> didn't take long to plug the gap left by its departing chief executive <strong>John Fry</strong>. It has appointed <strong>Adrian Jeakings</strong>, the current finance director, as his successor. He will take over once Fry leaves at the end of this year for his ceo post at <strong>Johnston Press</strong>.</p> <p>So what do we know of Jeakings? He is an accountant who was previously finance director at the Stationery Office and prior to that held \"senior roles\" at Schlumberger, the oilfield services corporation, and Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the credit information provider. His newspaper experience is confined to his six years with Archant.</p> <p>Jeakings said of his appointment: \"I am delighted to have the opportunity to further develop the business. Archant has modest borrowings, a robust digital strategy, excellent brands, and a dedicated and dynamic team. Whilst these are challenging times for consumer media businesses I believe we are well placed to make further progress when conditions improve\".</p> <p>I know we have to refer to newspapers nowadays as brands, largely because of their multi-platform status, but I just wish Jeakings - in assuming control of a newspaper group - had seen fit to use that word, not to mention a few more: journalism, journalists and news. </p> <p>It wasn't a great start for the man who will oversee such excellent titles as the <strong>East Anglian Daily Times</strong> and the <strong>Eastern Daily Press</strong>.</p>",
  "<p>As we all filed back into the press room after Gordon Brown's speech I found myself at the centre of what looked suspiciously like a Tory dirty tricks campaign. </p> <p>Fellow journalists on several of the dailies were being rung by the Tory press office and told that I had heard Ruth Kelly, the transport secretary, saying the speech was \"awful\". Good story, eh? Brown speech attacked by cabinet minister! Splash!</p> <p>The problem with the story was that it was completely untrue. I had not even set eyes on Ruth Kelly let alone overheard her. So I contacted the Tories and asked them what was going on. </p> <p>\"Oh we tried to ring you and check it out. Someone told us you heard it,\" they said. </p> <p>\"But you didn't answer your mobile. We rang several times.\" (Interestingly, no message was left).</p> <p>When I asked why they had spread the story round without checking with me whether it was true I received a half apology. </p> <p>All very odd, particularly as the Tories are supposed to want Brown to stay in Number 10 because he is so unpopular. Why make up a story like that? And why Ruth Kelly? Ideas welcome....<br> </p>",
  "<p>Origami is the art of creating something out of paper; Milligami is the art of creating something out of absolutely nothing \u2014 or at least not very much.

Despite making a cool \u00a319m from the sales of Anton Ferdinand, George McCartney, Bobby Zamora and John Pantsil over the summer, the club hope to raise the \u00a330m Sheffield United want by sticking <strong>Dean Ashton, Mark Noble, Robert Green</strong> and <strong>Scott Parker</strong> in the Upton Park club shop window with 'For Sale \u2014 Going Cheap!' signs taped to their frontal lobes.</p> <p>They'll be removed from the window, of course, if West Ham owner <strong>Bjorgolfur Gudmundsson</strong> digs deep and bails the club out. Given that his last major financial decision involved ploughing several million quid into XL Airways just weeks before its collapse, he may just be fool enough to do so, too.</p> <p>Elsewhere, the back pages of the papers are so barren that they've been forced into churning out exactly the same stories they were producing two months ago. To whit: Spurs are to sign <strong>Andrei Arshavin</strong> for \u00a315m and they want to get rid of <strong>Hossam Ghaly</strong>. It's just that all this is going to take place in January now, rather than last summer.</p> <p>Arsenal and Chelsea have each taken a good grip of Barcelona's 14-year-old wonder kid <strong>Gerard Deulofeu</strong> and are furiously tugging away at him \u2014 which is precisely the sort of thing 14-year-olds enjoy. <strong>Michael Owen</strong>, for the second time this week, is desperately whirling his little arms around in the hope of attracting someone to extricate him from Newcastle by the end of the season.</p> <p>Apparently enamoured by the excellent example model professional and Derby County tea-boy <strong>Robbie Savage</strong> has always set on the pitch, Crewe want to make him a player-coach, while \u2014 and check this zinger of a rumour out \u2014 Paul Ince has until January to decide whether to pay \u00a35m to make on-loan Chile midfielder <strong>Carlos Villaneuva</strong>'s stay permanent.</p> <p>Finally, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/sep/24/manchestercity.premierleague\">Mark Hughes has been told that his bosses at Middle Eastlands won't interfere in his transfer policy as he's the expert, not them</a>.

  "<p>The global financial system is in chaos. Again. This time the epicentre is <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/news/specials/crisiswallstreet/2008/index.html\">America</a>.</p> <p>In 1948, the International Monetary Fund was established to maintain the stability of the international financial stability. Before then, major international financial crises occurred quite regularly every 50 years. Since 1980, we have faced wave after wave of crises, across Africa, Latin America, east Asia \u2013 and now the US.</p> <p>What has gone wrong? It's partly about financial markets getting out of control. But how have they got so far out of control, when we have an international agency to make sure they don't?</p> <p>The answer is not economic but political. Developed country governments, which represent 15% of the world population, have 60% of the votes in the IMF. And they run it in their own (unenlightened, short-term) self-interest. What could the IMF do to ward off the US financial crisis when the US government has one-sixth of the votes \u2013 enough to veto any major policy decision?</p> <p>But this is the least of the IMF's failures. It is generally recognised that its response to the <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/External/np/exr/facts/asia.htm\">1997 Asian crisis</a> was deeply flawed. Its \"solution\" to Latin America's 1980s <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_American_debt_crisis\">debt problems</a> left countries seriously vulnerable to contagion from the Asian crisis. Worst of all, it has dragged out the response to the 1980s debt problems of low-income countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, over decades. Many countries' debts are still unsustainable. African poverty remains as widespread and severe as it was in 1981.</p> <p>In the American financial crisis, people have lost their homes. In the African crisis, they lost their lives. Millions of them. And people are still losing their lives 26 years later.</p> <p>In 1981, Nobel laureate <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/mar/31/society.politics\">Amartya Sen</a> highlighted the central role of democracy in preventing famines, by making it impossible for governments to ignore its victims. The last 26 years have shown that exactly the same applies at the global level.</p> <p>When an institution is run by the rich, it serves their interests, regardless of the needs of the poor. If the US looked like facing even a small fraction of the human toll of the African crisis, the IMF would undoubtedly take decisive and very different action. That's because the US, whose 300 million people are largely unaware of the fund's existence, has 16.8% of the votes. The 41 low- and lower-middle-income countries of Africa have 732 million people. Their economies have been virtually run by the IMF for more than a generation. But they have just 3.6% of the votes. So their problems are neglected.</p> <p>The IMF was powerless to prevent the current crisis because the US was too powerful. It has mishandled developing country crises, at considerable human cost, because they are too weak. If we really want a stable international financial system \u2013 and if we are remotely serious about global poverty \u2013 it is time to democratise the IMF. Now. And the only obstacle is the hypocrisy of developed country governments in using their privileged position to preserve an anti-democratic voting system which they would be the first to condemn in any other context.</p>",
  "<p>James is 12 years old. His dad has been in and out of jail for most of those years, and his mother is heavily medicated to control her clinical depression and anxiety attacks. James is bright but difficult, angry at the world, uncooperative with teachers and social workers, to the extent that he has now been excluded from school. Instead he wanders the streets of his housing estate, the devil of boredom finding work for his idle hands. He has never been violent, but he is undoubtedly a nuisance, with a string of arrests for vandalism, drunk and disorderly, and possession of cannabis. Last year the local authority obtained an Asbo against him, obliging James to be home after 8pm each evening. Today he was picked up by police at 10pm \u2013 the third time he has been caught in breach of his order, meaning he goes automatically back to court. </p> <p>James is not a real boy, but he is an accurate composite of the 572 young offenders aged 14 or less highlighted by <a href=\"http://www.barnardos.org.uk/\">Barnardo</a>'s in their <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/sep/22/ukcrime.prisonsandprobation \">report</a> Locking Up or Giving Up? revealing the barbaric truth about our approach to child criminals in England and Wales \u2013 an approach that sees us locking up more children than any country in Europe bar the Russian Federation and Ukraine. Our use of child custody has increased five-fold over the past decade, at a time when rates of serious crime by children have remained roughly constant. <br> How should we respond to cases like James? What should happen next? Typically, James would be given a detention and training order (DTO), in other words a custodial sentence, for around four months. The cost to the taxpayer would be over \u00a360,000. For that money, James's school could have educated him separately for a full year with a specialist tutor supported by educational psychologists and the pick of any other professionals deemed necessary. </p> <p>Or that \u00a360,000 could pay for more than two years of specialist respite <a href=\"http://www.communitycare.co.uk/Articles/2002/08/29/37875/preventive-fostering.html\">fostering</a>, providing a safe second home and family where James could develop secure attachments, lose his bad habits, learn better ones \u2013 an intervention with extensive, proven effectiveness. </p> <p>That \u00a360,000 could also be enough to establish and support a modest community youth centre for a year, a place where James and many others like him could go to divert them from getting into trouble in the first place. If we prefer to focus resources on the children at greatest need, it would go a long way towards funding the types of life-changing programmes provided by the <a href=\"http://www.princes-trust.org.uk/\">Prince's Trust</a> or <a href=\"http://www.barnardos.org.uk/newdirections.htm\">Barnardo's</a> themselves. </p> <p>Or, if we were incredibly short-sighted and stupid, we could send James to a harsh, impersonal institution, for a period too short to offer any realistic prospect of rehabilitation, but long enough to leave him more brutalised, bitter and traumatised than ever. The known reoffending rate of those who have served a DTO is nearly 80% \u2013 making it the least effective intervention across the entire criminal justice system. The chances of reoffending actually increase according to how young the child is when first detained, and how often he or she has been detained. </p> <p>So this option would appear to be the worst of all possible worlds. It makes no sense to bleeding-heart liberals (hands up) who believe in rehabilitation of offenders and the potential for change. It will make little sense to the hang 'em and flog 'em brigade, who <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/yourview/1576081/Are-the-courts-too-soft-on-young-offenders.html\">still think</a> of custodial institutions as \"holiday camps\". </p> <p>There is however, one crucial exception. The current system does make perfect financial sense to local authority executives and accountants. All the preventative solutions outlined above, and many other alternatives, would have to be paid for by councils out of council tax. The costs of juvenile detention are met centrally by Jack Straw's Ministry of Justice. So while everyone, as tax payers, as victims of crime, and of course the young offenders themselves would be better served by prophylactics than punishment, councils have little financial incentive to prevent these custodial sentences becoming necessary. One solution proposed by Barnardo's is that local authorities foot the bill for youth custody, thus giving them an incentive to opt for prevention. This makes sense, assuming that national government make up the budget shortfall through central funding. </p> <p>Barnardo's estimate that at least \u00a327.5m could be saved each year if custodial sentences were reserved for children who commit serious and violent crimes. If that money were reinvested in preventative approaches, the savings and benefits would be immeasurable. There was a time when New Labour liked to talk about \"joined up government\". The current approach to juvenile justice is about as joined up as a plate of macaroni.</p>",
