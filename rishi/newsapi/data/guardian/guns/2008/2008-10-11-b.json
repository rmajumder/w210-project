  "<p>When Californians go to the polls on 4 November, not only will they have to choose between Barack Obama and John McCain, but also whether they support minimum confinement rules for calves in veal crates, hens in battery cages and sows in gestation crates. Coloradans will vote on a constitutional amendment to allow residents of three Colorado communities a vote to extend casino hours, and citizens of Washington state must decide on permitting lethal prescriptions for terminally ill adults and, separately, on an initiative requiring the synchronisation of traffic lights.<br>Add to that the elections to state-wide and community offices, and you will appreciate how busy the average US citizen will be on the first Tuesday in November.</p> <p>Of course it couldn't happen in Scotland. Both a report on the 2007 election and the Scottish parliament have concluded that we cannot cope with the responsibility of electing our MSPs and councillors on the same day. But if we take seriously a recommendation from Reform Scotland's latest publication, 'Power to Protect', we could soon find ourselves emulating our American cousins in one respect \u2013 electing the area procurator fiscal.</p> <p>The report's authors nurse a naive hope that such elections wouldn't be fought on a party political basis, but it would only be a matter of time before the competing legal professionals used their favoured party organisation to help get out their vote. And surely at a time when serious thought should be given to making the prosecution role of Lord Advocate less political, it's a bit wacky to politicise the role of the fiscal.</p> <p>But as with all such reports, it's important not to throw the baby out with the bath water. Another of the report's recommendations may find increasing support, namely that no one should be sent to jail in the first instance for a sentence of less than three months. The arguments are well made, not least the fact that little or nothing can be achieved in such a short time to promote rehabilitation. Rather, the convicted person too often matriculates in the college of crime at some considerable expense to the taxpayer.</p> <p>This proposal follows fast on the recommendation from the Scottish Prisons Commission that the government should bring forward legislation to require a sentencing judge, who would otherwise have imposed a sentence of six months imprisonment or less, to impose a community supervision sentence instead. These ideas merit serious consideration \u2013 provided sheriffs don't substitute a six-month term with one for seven months.</p> <p>The significance of these radical proposals is that they are made against a backdrop of a very real overcrowding problem in our prisons. Scotland's prison population reached 8,137 last month, exceeding, by some margin, the spaces realistically available. So when the chief executive of the Scottish Prison Service, Mike Ewart, tells a national newspaper that he has to 'speak out' because he believes numbers have reached a level, which is 'unsafe operationally and legally', we must surely sit up and take note?</p> <p>We are also entitled to assume that Mr Ewart has advised his ministers of the immediacy of such a critical situation, but if ministers have a contingency plan, Kenny MacAskill's deputy, Fergus Ewing, was being remarkably coy about it when he appeared before the parliament's Justice Committee last Tuesday.</p> <p>As Justice Minister, in 2002, I appeared before the Justice Committee and tried to make the case for three new private prisons. I made little headway not only because of philosophical opposition to private prisons, but also because committee members \u2013 and particularly Mr MacAskill's colleagues \u2013 didn't believe the projections, ranging up to 8,500 prisoners. I argued that a consequence of not facing up to these projections could be that one day we would 'have to let people out because there was no room for them'.</p> <p>I must confess to having some empathy with Mr MacAskill. The prisons must accept all whom the independent judiciary send. And he has also advocated a much greater use of options to imprisonment using community based sentences. In fact, in 2006-07 there were 40 per cent more community sentences than in the first year of devolution. Yet the prison population continued to rise. That should not dampen Mr MacAskill's enthusiasm for putting more emphasis and resource into non-custodial sentences, but it may be some time before it has an impact on numbers.</p> <p>In response to the committee's questions about the possible crisis, Fergus Ewing pointed to the three new prisons to which this government is committed. Addiewell in West Lothian should receive its first prisoners at the turn of the year, but the other two, at Bishopbriggs and Grampian, are either at the tendering or planning stage. This is not a seventh cavalry just about to appear from over the hill.</p> <p>The real crunch will come if there is an incident such as a fire in one of the prisons. At that stage, the Justice Secretary has a simple choice: let some out or find alternative accommodation in which to lock them all up. You can't put them in tents on a playing field. Before the committee, Fergus Ewing seemed to dismiss Annabel Goldie's suggestion of converted old hospitals or military barracks so that narrows the option.</p> <p>In 2002, parliament was not persuaded of the case for three new prisons, and so modified proposals had to be brought forward. Should Mr MacAskill have to come before this parliament with difficult proposals for early release, he will be hoping there is a collective parliamentary responsibility, handed down from the past, to support him.</p>",
  "<p>The global economy is in meltdown, yet the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague\">Premier League</a> want to spend \u00a3150m on an academy scheme - just to get round the 90-minute rule on how far kids can travel to their existing football academies? It sounds absurd. Premier League football may think itself immune to the pressures of the economy, but with Uefa president Michel Platini, among others, talking about the need to draw in the purse strings, it is a good time to start waking up to reality.</p> <p>In the past TV revenues have filled a super-duper pot of money at Premier League rights auctions, but in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/creditcrunch\">current financial climate</a> how secure are the TV companies themselves? Advertising revenue is down and the average householder is beginning to feel the pinch, so how long before subscriptions go down and TV companies stumble? </p> <p>Over lunch with the England lads last week, we debated the new proposals. Huge investment sums aside, some of us felt the most disturbing aspect was encouraging 11-year-old kids to leave home to chase a dream. The whole idea has more in common with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory than a sensible career plan - hoping for a golden ticket to a football megastar future. </p> <p>When I was 11 I never thought about a career in football, I just loved playing. Is it morally right to be pushing football careers to 11-year-olds? I still wince every time a parent comes up to me and says their kid, aged seven, is enrolled in an academy. That's just plain wrong. Football shouldn't be about kids becoming superstars, it should just be about having fun. </p> <p>There's something weirdly X Factor about it all, hundreds of hopefuls dreaming of making it through to the final. Who knows, with TV revenue helping to fund the academies, how long before they want a piece of the action and the public start voting kids off the show?</p> <p>Despite my reservations, I do think there is scope for the Premier League to consider regionalised academies - but only if the pupils there were independent of any one club. It is too much pressure for a young footballer to have a club shelling out \u00a325,000 a year for their education, and it just perpetuates the cycle of agents grabbing at them and individual clubs enjoying a monopoly of the best players.</p> <p>Instead, why not adopt a US-style draft system whereby on graduation, aged 16, each youngster is put up for selection to Premier League teams. If the investment by the Premier League clubs is focused on developing academies to produce world-class footballers rather than helping already dominant clubs to extend their control over the best young players, then every club will have a more even chance of success.</p> <p>That's the beauty of the NFL draft system, it allows a more competitive and less predictable outcome each season. As a result the league reinvents itself every few years and there isn't a single side dominating the league over the course of a decade, like we so often see in top-flight football here. </p> <p>The plans would be more friendly to the Football League, too, who could recruit any players not selected by Premier League clubs - after five years of elite training these youngsters would be the best leftovers in football, without any investment from the lower league.</p> <p>The whole system would need a strong ethical backbone. An emphasis on education - not just the national curriculum, but a football education including basic refereeing and sports-science qualifications that would give youngsters the foundation of a career in football even if they did not make it as superstar players. Pupils should include a quantity of girls and disabled footballers - why should elite facilities and coaching only be made available to able-bodied young men? The message that football is for everyone should be encouraged at every level. </p> <p>The system would relieve the FA of the financial burden of developing young talent; instead they could step away from the academy side of things and concentrate on supporting grassroots football and raising the profile of the game. </p> <p>In a climate of money-grabbing and 'me, me, me' attitudes, this structure would adopt a more holistic approach. There would be tangible benefits to a wider community than just the Premier League elite, and yet the incentives for investment by the clubs are clear: they would be able to choose from a crop of talented, matured youngsters, rather than having to take the gamble of trying to select the next top goalkeeper when the kid is aged 11. It is time for a change in attitude from football's top tier and this could be the start of it. </p> <h2>Nuts over trophy</h2> <p>A very big thank you to the Football Supporters' Federation for presenting me with a special award on the pitch last Sunday (below) for my Observer columns. One of the FSF ladies kindly said the gang at their headquarters read every word. Well I have their magazine sent to me and always read their articles, which help give me a fans' perspective on things. The trophy will go in my kitchen with the rest of the silverware, including last season's proud addition - the Nuts worst hairdo of the year award, for my Clark Kent impression.</p> <p><em>David James has donated his fee for this column to charity</em></p>",
  "<p>The last competitive international break of the year provides a handy pause for a snapshot of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague\">Premier League</a>, gloriously unpredictable after seven games with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/hullcity\">Hull</a> in a Champions League position and winless <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/tottenhamhotspur\">Tottenham</a> rooted to the bottom of the table. </p> <p>While that may change over the course of the season, one thing it is safe to say at present is that Phil Brown appears to be doing his job better than Juande Ramos. The Hull boss has deservedly been named manager of the month after supervising away victories at Arsenal and Spurs, while the man who took Tottenham to Carling Cup success last season may not get another month unless his players buck up their ideas fairly smartish. </p> <p>One could not go so far as to assert that Brown is a better manager than Ramos - he has yet even to sample European football, let alone win back-to-back Uefa Cups - and the feeling that the former Sevilla manager has been undermined by his own board of directors' ruinous transfer-market policy grew last weekend with a series of starring performances by former Spurs players at their new clubs. Dimitar Berbatov, Jermain Defoe, Robbie Keane and Steed Malbranque are the new darlings of Manchester United, Portsmouth, Liverpool and Sunderland respectively, while Spurs have been underwhelmed by their major summer signings. Luka Modric and Roman Pavlyuchenko are now injured and David Bentley has lost his England place. </p> <p>There is a strong suspicion that Spurs, like Newcastle, have made life difficult for their manager by diluting his direct control over first-team matters with other individuals involved in buying and selling, and for that reason it is impossible to say Brown would fare any better under present circumstances at White Hart Lane. Which is just as well, since Spurs would never have appointed him. They wanted a continental manager to go with their continental scouting and recruitment system. They were never remotely interested in hiring an Englishman when they lost confidence in Martin Jol last year - indeed Jol has just revealed they were looking at Ramos the season before.</p> <p>Why, you may ask, are people persevering with football directors and continental systems when it seems much easier to do what Hull did and go out and find a decent manager? Why, for that matter, have West Ham just appointed Gianfranco Zola when they have never previously had an overseas manager? It's not as if there are no decent English candidates about. West Ham were thumped 3-1 at home last Saturday by the Ginger Mourinho, as Bolton's resolutely unglamorous and archetypally English Gary Megson is affectionately known.</p> <p>Bolton will never win any style awards, it is true, yet all those years as Sam Allardyce's assistant do not appear to have done Brown any harm. His Hull team are not playing with one man up front and nine behind the ball, they are winning praise for their positive, attractive football. Allardyce himself is still available, his unhappy relationship with the Newcastle fans having left him all but unemployable, though it should be remembered that, before Mike Ashley brought Dennis Wise, a continental-style recruitment system and a daily dose of hilarity to the club, the former Bolton manager was the choice of the old board precisely because they wanted stability and gradual growth. </p> <p>Outside the Premier League are promising English managers a-plenty, from Aidy Boothroyd at Watford and Kevin Blackwell at Sheffield United to Paul Simpson at Shrewsbury, the last responsible for two 7-0 wins in the past month. Even inside the Premier League there is no shortage of locally produced managerial talent. There are currently eight English club managers, plus another seven from Ireland, Scotland or Wales. </p> <p>That does not sound too bad, but look more closely at the clubs managed by Englishmen. None of them are Champions League material. Only one is playing in Europe and, while Portsmouth winning the FA Cup was a thrill for Harry Redknapp and the supporters, the club now appear to be broke. </p> <p>If you can't make money out of a Cup run any more and the lucrative Champions League is operating as a closed shop, success must be redefined. Installing football directors and continental systems can to some extent be seen as an attempt to make money from trading players. Spurs did not factor a visit to the bottom of the table into their thinking, though they did make more than \u00a350m in summer from the sale of Keane and Berbatov alone, and had they given themselves a little more time to find replacements they might now be looking at a more comfortable league position and a worthwhile profit. </p> <p>It was Newcastle, however, who explained the situation most succinctly. Kevin Keegan had to go, it was put out, because he had daft, crowd-pleasing ideas such as signing Thierry Henry when Newcastle did not have the money. What Newcastle wanted to do instead was use a sophisticated scouting system to beat Ars\u00e8ne Wenger at his own game and sign the next Cesc F\u00e1bregas, or spot a future Henry as a youth. </p> <p>The hypothetical question of what Newcastle would have done with such players - would they have delivered titles, like Arsenal, then sold at a profit, or were they just interested in the profit? - will never be answered. Ashley has lost interest in the club and stands to lose money. Tony Jimenez, their vice-president in charge of recruitment, has just quit. The experiment seems to be over. If and when Ashley finds a buyer the odds are that Newcastle will revert to a more traditional managerial model, perhaps even with an English manager. </p> <p>With Zola waiting to see how much of West Ham survives the Icelandic banking crisis, all eyes are on Ramos and Spurs. Should the manager pay the price for further poor results, that ought not to mean the end of the system - the whole point of the continental model is that once in place coaches become as interchangeable as players - though the structure and a whole lot more could go out of the window if Spurs end up in what we in England call a relegation dog-fight. Could the season get any sillier after Joe Kinnear at Newcastle? Of course it could. Big Sam for Spurs, anyone?</p> <h2>Another share in the credit crunch issue</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool\">Liverpool's</a> plans for a new ground have been stalled by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/creditcrunch\">credit crunch</a> and a degree of uncertainty over future ownership of the club. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/everton\">Everton</a> are still insisting there is nowhere to relocate except the unpopular site at Kirkby, yet there are no plans to do the obvious thing and share a super stadium now that Stanley Park has been made available for development.</p> <p>There is no desire among the fans to share a stadium, Liverpool's Rick Parry has explained, and he is probably right. On the other hand, there was no conspicuous desire among the fans to be sold into American ownership, and Liverpool did not let that hold them back.</p> <p>Ground-sharing might be a no-no for haughty neighbours who derive a great deal of pleasure from hating each other, but ground vandalism is another matter. Liverpool are perfectly entitled to build a new greenfield stadium if they wish, as soon as they feel they can afford it, though a ground as historic and fit for purpose as Anfield deserves a better fate than the bulldozers. Especially when Everton, with the myopia that comes naturally to partners in football rivalry, claim they have searched the whole city and cannot find a stadium-sized gap anywhere.</p> <p>The City of Culture should slap a preservation order on Anfield, which is at least as famous and well loved as the statelier buildings on the waterfront, to conserve it for posterity. It may be difficult in a few years' time for anyone to remember what traditional grounds used to be like. Anfield could be transported brick by brick and turned into a Pier Head tourist attraction. Alternatively it could stay where it is and be kept alive by getting Everton to play in it, if necessary with a cattle prod. </p> <h2>Rorting on the wall for salary cap</h2> <p>Rorting is what they call it in Australia, where any number of ingenious ways of getting round a salary cap have been discovered, and often not discovered, in recent years. Salary caps have their place in keeping spending sensible within necessarily competitive sporting structures, though they work best in smallish, self-contained, even isolated sports such as rugby league. It is hard to imagine how a unilateral cap could succeed in the global sport of football, and even harder to envisage the Premier League risking its status as most-watched, best-rewarded and highest-rolling league in the world by inviting all its expensively imported stars to up sticks.</p> <p>But bring it on, by all means. It will be fun trying to apply wage and spending restraint to a sport with notorious issues of transparency over player ownership, club ownership, use and remuneration of agents, and transfers generally. Football could never even make any of its bung inquiries stick, and soon it might be too late. A salary cap is a challenge, an invitation to be creative, if not downright devious. It almost becomes part of the game. And rorts, like bungs, will become part of the language.</p>",
  "<p>Externally, there has always been something of the douce Scots banker to George Burley. Prim of appearance, careful of phrase, no controversy intentionally courted. The question for Scottish football has been what sits under the surface: dependable decision-making or a deceptive descent into calamity? <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/norway\"><br>Norway</a> at Hampden represented Burley's credit crunch. Defeat in Macedonia had slashed the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/scotland\">Scotland</a> manager's credit rating; high-risk victory in Iceland restored only fragile confidence. For Burley and his bosses, this was the 'must-win' match. For most observers, it was the test of whether Scotland's sporting investments were safe under the Ayrshireman's stewardship. The goalless draw, the five points lost in three <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/worldcup2010qualifiers\">World Cup qualifiers</a>, the clear failure of Burley's pass-and-create strategy all argue against. A decade has elapsed since Scotland last made their way to a major international tournament and now South Africa 2010 seems a painfully distant dream. </p> <p>For all the obvious enthusiasm with which Burley pursued the post (the cynical suggesting it offered a soft-landing exit from a troubled Southampton), he inherited the national side at a difficult time. Neither Walter Smith nor Alex McLeish quite managed to end Scotland's international tournament famine, but both carried the nation close enough to be mourned upon departing for more comfortably remunerated club positions. </p> <p>Failure to recover the mistakes of Berti Vogts or to qualify from a group containing France, Italy and Ukraine were regarded as heroic, as improvements were seen on the pitch. Not finishing at least second in a section filled out by Holland, Norway, Iceland and Macedonia will be perceived as not good enough. Burley, however, has not made the job easy for himself. </p> <p>Appointing an archetypal England captain in Terry Butcher as his assistant - albeit one with more Scottish Premier League coaching experience than he possesses - invited scorn. Drafting lower-division Anglo-Scots such as Kris Commons into the squad evokes dangerous echoes of Vogts' scattergun search for talent. </p> <p>Yet there are also factors outside his control. If the team Burley sent out yesterday appeared weaker than the one who came close to dumping Italy out of Euro 2008, he had limited control over the alterations. A perplexing foot injury has prevented Alan Hutton from playing a single match in Tottenham's calamitous campaign and deprived Scotland of their most athletic defender and a key attacking force. Effectively, two players gone in one. </p> <p>Injury also accounted for the absence of Barry Ferguson's ability to cosset and cajole from the midfield, and Kenny Miller's selfless front-running. Stephen McManus was sidelined by Reykjavik's unfortunate red card. Only Lee McCulloch's early retirement from the international game could be laid at the new manager's door. </p> <p>Tactically, Burley has surprised with his aggression. Where Smith and McLeish played the percentages, bulking up the midfield and pursuing opponents on the counter, their successor has pushed players into attack. Two forward in Macedonia, three in Iceland and (when his system worked) three again for yesterday's first home qualifier were all based on a belief that Scotland's creative resources are more generous than those in defence. </p> <p>Scotland a direct, physical football team? An inaccurate stereotype, argued Burley pre-game: 'I have said often enough that midfield is our strongest department. Why would I want to bypass that? Let's enjoy passing the ball, let's enjoy the movement, because that's our strength.' To underline his point, the training-ground strategy of stationing 6ft 4in Chris Iwelumo at centre-forward was abandoned for a subtler, more ambitious approach. </p> <p>With James McFadden as the central striker, Shaun Maloney on the left wing and James Morrison floating between the two, it was an attempt at emulating this season's Chelsea with rather less esteemed personnel. The problem was, Norway were enjoying Scotland's passing more than the home crowd. </p> <p>Too often, possession was cheaply lost in the middle of the pitch. Attempts to evade Norway's rangy centre-backs ended with crosses too deep for any finisher to test the visitors' debutant goalkeeper. Age Hareide's team could afford to wait for their moment and counter. John Carew's muscularity and pace offered far greater scoring threat. </p> <p>During a prolonged stint of technical-area duty, Burley brought the left-footed Barry Robson in from the right wing and switched Morrison to a more natural position. The Chelsea effect still stubbornly absent, he turned to Iwelumo and 4-4-2 directness, and finally began threatening Norway. </p> <p>Robson stretched goalkeeper Jon Knudsen, while Maloney thrice drifted shots wide of him, Steven Fletcher claimed a penalty and Iwelumo missed an open goal from embarrassingly close quarters. Hampden roared for a goal, then gasped in astonishment. The Nigerian-Scot's mum had told him before the game to 'score a hat-trick on my debut' and everything would be fine. It wasn't for Iwelumo and it certainly wasn't for Burley.</p>",

  "<p>This story begins with an ending. On 11 April 2003, Thomas Hurndall, a 21-year-old photojournalist, was shot in the head in Gaza by a sniper from the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/israelandthepalestinians\">Israeli</a> army. </p> <p>Tom was a brilliant, intrepid young man, driven by an energetic morality, a wish to make a difference in the world. The shooting left him with unsurvivable brain damage, but he clung to life - against the odds - in a coma, for nine months. </p> <p>While he lay dying in Tel Aviv and later in the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead, north London, his parents, Anthony and Jocelyn Hurndall, took on a heroic struggle against the Israeli army. They were determined to seek truth and accountability at all costs. They had no idea how hard this was going to be.</p> <p>The Israeli army appeared to view Tom's death with indifference; there were no plans to investigate the shooting, interview witnesses or go to Gaza. Nor, at first, were they willing to meet the Hurndalls. Their claim was that their soldier had fired at an armed terrorist. Tom, dressed in an orange jacket (a known sign for peace workers), was unarmed. What's more he was shot while rescuing Palestinian children. </p> <p>Faced with lies and silence, Anthony, a commercial lawyer, did the only thing he could: he took the case on himself. It was his meticulous investigation that led to the prosecution of Bedouin sniper Sergeant Wahid Taysir, who got eight years (the longest sentence ever received by an Israeli Defence Forces soldier for shooting an unarmed civilian in the occupied territories). Vengeance was not Anthony's motivation. He wanted only to find out what had happened. But the verdict was, in the bleakest way imaginable, a personal victory.</p> <p>Jocelyn has told her story in a beautifully written, uncompromising book, My Son Tom (Bloomsbury). More riskily, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/channel4\">Channel 4</a> has turned the story into a drama to be broadcast tomorrow: The Shooting of Thomas Hurndall, written by Simon Block and directed by Rowan Joffe. Stephen Dillane plays Anthony and Kerry Fox plays Jocelyn. The film manages to be neither sensational nor sentimental - quite a feat. </p> <p>It is its understatement that overwhelms. Anthony and Jocelyn divorced several years before Tom's death and the film conveys the strained decency of their relationship and their admirable transcending of differences. </p> <p>The three surviving children - Sophie, Bill and Fred - are carefully characterised, and what the film spells out is that the shooting of Tom was a shattering of the entire family. Each of them took the impact of the sniper's fire. But I wondered if the film might have taken some emotional liberties too: Anthony is seen to be all head, Jocelyn all heart. And they are presented in rivalrous stances, as if we are being asked to choose between them. Was it really like that? </p> <p>I met the Hurndalls separately: Anthony first, on a cold autumn day, in his offices near the Bank of England. He is tall, with a shambling gait, and is absolutely direct. You don't feel any slipperiness, any side. I liked him at once and admired his ability to talk with clarity about complicated issues. At the same time, he often left sentences unfinished as if he lacked the will to complete them. I noticed how often he leant back and shut his eyes when speaking, as if closing his eyes would have the opposite effect - make it possible to see.</p> <p>For Anthony, the film is a 'further memorial' to Tom. But what matters most to him is that audiences should understand that what happened was 'not a freak accident, but a product of a policy that the Israeli armed forces were adopting in Gaza'. There is barely suppressed outrage in his voice as he remembers the British government's failure to protest when Tom was shot: 'The government viewed Israel as a close ally who they did not want to put out in any way.'</p> <p>It was only when a Tel Aviv bar was bombed by two British Muslims three weeks after the shooting of Tom in 2003 that Anthony became aware of how skewed the British government's attitude could be. 'Jack Straw expressed deep sympathy to the Israelis and promised to put all the resources of the British government at their disposal. This was our government taking responsibility for two people who were not employees of the British government, merely two citizens of Britain who happened to be in Israel.'</p> <p>But when their own British citizens (Tom, along with Iain Hook, a UN worker shot by an Israeli sniper in November 2002, and James Miller, a documentary-maker shot by an IDF patrol in May 2003) were attacked by Israeli soldiers, there was no outcry (no ministerial interest at all, beyond a standard request, from a junior level, for a proper inquiry). 'They were shot not by people for whom the Israeli government had no responsibility but by their own soldiers. That, for me, was outrageous.'</p> <p>Anthony approves of the film and thinks Dillane got a lot of things right. But he resists the idea of himself as the 'dry lawyer'. He feels a 'little put out' at a scene in which he is in a hurry to get back to the office while Jocelyn waits devotedly by Tom's bedside: 'It was not like that.' He finds Dillane's Anthony 'more confident than I am. I am much more uncertain about things.' He admits he can switch gear into 'detached' mode and adds: 'I do live in my head.' But he wants it on record that 'there is a lot of emotion there'. </p> <p>I don't doubt it. The way he uses Tom's name as emotional shorthand reveals the strength of his feelings: 'When I heard that Tom had been shot, I felt angry and worried, but already I knew that if this had happened, this was Tom doing something which was Tom. When we heard he had been going to rescue children - that was absolutely Tom. He had this strong, protective urge - a tremendous feeling of caring about putting things right.' </p> <p>It was Tom's need to put things right that became, for Anthony, an unspoken direction, an imperative. He remembers it like this: 'Tom, you are lying there. This is what you want. This is what we are going to do for you, Tom - with you.' That 'with' is affecting because the more accurate word would have been 'without'.</p> <p>Anthony describes Tom as a little boy who was 'troubled', although 'outgoing', and 'determined to do his own thing'. He 'hated arrogance', intellectual or otherwise. He was much loved because he was 'always there for people. He would talk to anybody, on any level, about anything.' </p> <p>Tom was 15 or 16 when his parents split up. 'Being the angry teenager he was, we didn't talk for a while,' Anthony recalls. But football (Arsenal) and photography were shared passions. And by the time Tom left England in 2003, 'we had re-established quite close bonds. We were still a little aloof but much closer. We discussed his preparations for the trip. I remember talking about what he was going to do to keep safe.' </p> <p>Tom also discussed the trip with his 'very closest friends, who happened to be Jewish'. But his attitude would have been: 'I want to find out for myself.'</p> <p>It is painful listening to Anthony piecing together the past, trying to reconfigure his relationship with Tom before he died. I suggest that it was remarkable that he and Jocelyn managed to work together with such dignity. 'There have been enormous stresses,' he admits. 'Don't be under any illusions about that, but I think we are now closer in many ways.' </p> <p>Before I leave, I hear myself asking - I hadn't meant to put it so baldly - how much Tom's death has changed his life? 'The whole experience has changed my view of life and of what is important,' he answers. He describes being 'in the City, in a bar, seeing people have a good time - it seems completely unreal'. He admits he has lost the taste for 'life's pleasures'. 'Work is what matters.'</p> <p>Anthony's work now is to create a forum for people to solve their legal difficulties outside the court. He finds, in this good-hearted project, an af finity with Tom. But he remains hard on himself. He believes that because of Tom's death: 'I am a lesser parent. I don't take the children on holidays.' He bought some golf clubs: 'They haven't been out of the cupboard.'</p> <p>He feels that Tom's death has made him more spiritual: 'I used to read to Tom in intensive care. I spent hours with him. I read the Koran for the first time and Taoism. It was a time for contemplation, working out what was important.' </p> <p>Gaza, he explains, was 'so dramatic and powerful. The best journalist cannot portray the reality of what is happening. What is an Israeli-only road? What is a checkpoint?' He believes we have 'so little idea of what is happening'.</p> <p>Grief, he recognises, can make you see more keenly. It has also made the political personal: 'I remember saying to someone [about Gaza and the Middle Eastern conflict] the Israelis can't say the problem is only theirs. This is now our issue.'</p> <p>Jocelyn Hurndall lives in Tufnell Park, north London. She has a radiance that is immediately attractive. But faces carry their recent emotional history and her grief is as indelible as a watermark. She wonders whether we might sit in her garden. It is a is lovely, peaceful, idiosyncratic place - a shrine of sorts. I exclaim at the tiny, weeping silver birch at its centre: 'It was planted for Tom,' she says. 'It's going to make me cry.' 'Don't,' I say. 'It's doing your weeping for you.' I feel an immediate rapport with this woman whose emotions, five years on, are still so close to the surface, so available to her.</p> <p>In her book, she wrote: 'People know about death in the Middle East... it is one of the things that gives life there its vibrancy. In the West we are not forced to look death in the face in the same way - we barely acknowledge its existence. We take our lives very much for granted.' Tom's death has changed that permanently: 'I never take my life for granted.'</p> <p>She tells me: 'Tom valued the moment, the meaning of things. I respect that. It is what I have learnt from him.' And after his death, she learnt that being able to 'meet the moment' was an essential part of grieving too - not running away even from the most agonising details: the scent of Tom's clothes, the look of his handwriting. </p> <p>We talk about gardening, how it insists you live in the present (but with an optimistic eye on the future). Her hands, she says, have been roughened by it, but it has helped her heart. Being able to garden is emotional progress for her. 'For a long while I could not look at anything beautiful - lichen, for example, that has taken a lifetime to grow on a stone. I couldn't look at the beauty of this world without thinking about what Tom had lost.'</p> <p>The film conveys the profound alienation after Tom's death - the shock of being pitched from London into a Middle East war zone. Isn't grief itself like this; doesn't it bring with it a feeling of being in a foreign country, an attendant unreality? A sense of not being at home in your own skin? She agrees. 'Back then, even being with a group of friends felt foreign. You weren't able to give anything back - and that was shocking.' </p> <p>One insight in her book is that a family is seldom united by grief. Mourning is an individual thing, a lonely road. I can see (as Jocelyn herself recognises) that her emotional articulacy might not always have been easy for her family. And it must have been hard for her too. Looking back, she finds Anthony's grieving 'completely different' from hers because 'it was so far under the surface'. She says: 'My brain was shot. He seemed to be able to use his.' Her son Billy was different again. He coped by completely rebuilding his little brother Fred's room after Tom's death, an awesome job for a boy with no formal carpenter's training. Jocelyn is still so proud of this that she takes me to inspect his handiwork. </p> <p>I wonder how Jocelyn feels now about allowing a child, albeit a grown-up child, to go to a war zone. 'When Tom first said he was going away [Iraq was his initial destination], I froze. I could not speak when I found out my challenging, extremely bright son was planning to do this. I felt: how could he put us through this?'</p> <p>It was a long time before she was able to respect his decision. Now she believes 'we learn so much from risk takers', from people not content to 'sit on their comfortable sofas'. She remembers Tom asking her 'why a 21-year-old on the other side of the world should live a much more difficult life than I do in London'. She salutes his thinking: 'He saw acceptance of difference as one of the answers to the universe,' and she agrees with him: 'Inclusion is essential - on climate change, on banking crises. We need to think in a more global way.'</p> <p>Since Tom's death, Jocelyn no longer works as a head of learning support at a state school. She is, instead, the director of the Middle East charity Friends of Birzeit University, which raises funds for academic scholarships for Palestinian students. 'It is to do with education for an oppressed group who experience barriers to learning,' she says. Her daughter, Sophie, has also gravitated towards charity work; in her case, Map (Medical Aid for Palestinians). She has become an exceptionally effective campaigner (the importance of her role in the family has been written out of the film).</p> <p>Jocelyn hopes the film will make audiences 'abandon an emotional response to the conflict and make an objective attempt to open their minds to what this is really about. Highly intelligent people often lose all their logic about this conflict.' It is interesting that just as Anthony wants me to know that he is emotional, she wants me to know she can be logical. But both Hurndalls want people to know what is happening in Gaza. Her eyes blaze as she describes the 'wanton destruction of people's homes'. She wishes she could bring politicians in 'by the busload' to see what she has seen. </p> <p>And yet it is clear that Jocelyn will never find it possible to abandon the emotional response to the Middle East conflict. 'The life-changing moment for me was when Fred, who was only 12, was interviewed by the BBC. \"How do you feel?\" they asked him. He was standing next to Tom's blood on the ground. He was like a ghost. He said, \"They shot my brother, he was doing something good, he was rescuing children.\"' </p> <p>She tells me that part of Tom's legacy is the realisation that how a story is told is crucial - words matter to her, as they did to him, tremendously. It is this that suddenly reminds me to ask her about the Israeli judge who passed sentence in words so unjudiciously lyrical they take the breath away. She knows 'nothing about him', she says, but continues to cherish the words he chose. This was his summing up: 'Sergeant Wahid Taysir caused a soul to leave this world. He spilt the blood of a young man in the bloom of youth, causing the loss of an entire world. When that young man was alive, there was no one else like him, and there will never be anyone like him again.'</p> <p>\u2022 The Shooting of Thomas Hurndall will be broadcast on C4 Monday October 13 at 9pm </p> <p>\u2022 Friends of Birzeit University campaigns for the educational rights of Palestinian students.

  "<p>Thousands of new homes are at risk of being 'down-valued' by lenders, making it harder for some purchases to go ahead, and potentially distorting some house-price indices.</p> <p>The Council of Mortgage Lenders and the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors - authors of new guidelines to help valuers make impartial judgments - say that 'several lenders' now insist that mortgage offers on newly built flats and houses are automatically dropped to secondhand values. </p> <p>At first sight this may appear welcome news for buyers, as it reduces prices to more affordable levels, but it can sabotage some transactions. 'It leaves buyers in the lurch,' says Lee Holland of Town &amp; Country Mortgages. 'They agree a deal in principle with a builder, possibly already including a price cut. Then the buyer applies for a mortgage but the lender gets a valuation at an automatically lower price. So unless the buyer makes up the shortfall, the deal collapses.' </p> <p>Until now, the procedure has been for mortgage offers to be based on valuations in line with RICS guidelines. These advise valuers to seek 'comparables' - similar homes recently sold nearby - and include reference to a premium on new homes, because of their supposedly prime condition and modern features. </p> <p>The guidelines were amended on 1 September, when the RICS and CML issued advice to valuers on how to quantify 'incentives' such as furniture packages and stamp duty payments offered by developers. However, some individual lenders are disregarding the new advice and issuing instructions to down-value all new homes. </p> <p>The Nationwide wrote to its valuers as long ago as November 2007, asking them to value all new flats as 'secondhand'. In June 2008, it asked them to extend this to all new houses. In a further letter in July, the valuers were told they did not have to produce any written explanation about why a newbuild home was given a lower value, so long as it was 90 per cent or more of its previous 'as new' price. </p> <p>'We're doing this to protect our borrowers and ourselves,' says a spokeswoman. 'We find it hard to tell what incentives are worth, so we've issued a wider instruction.' </p> <p>But the RICS says this may be unfair, because not all incentives are of equal value and some new homes have no incentives anyway. 'The system exists for valuations to take regard of incentives on a property-by-property basis. But some worried lenders are being ultra-cautious. Lenders are just safeguarding themselves,' says Luay al-Khatib of RICS's valuation department.</p> <p>The CML says that 'a minority' of lenders have introduced their own rules over valuations, and it can neither control nor monitor what they do. </p> <p>RBS and HBOS both say they considered down-valuing but chose to go with the new RICS-CML guidelines. 'We're fully satisfied with the new incentives-disclosure arrangement and believe we can make reasonable mortgage offers on the basis of that information,' says a Halifax spokeswoman.</p> <p>Developers, of course, are up in arms at what they see as a deliberate bid by the Nationwide and some other lenders to deter sales. The down-valuing is perceived as particularly harsh on specialist builders, who make high-specification homes that have few or no incentives, even in poor markets such as today's. </p> <p>'This is another nail in the market coffin,' warns Tony Dowse, chairman of niche developer Environ Country Homes. 'It drives prices down and leads to a spiral of decline. Specialist builders produce innovative homes with distinctive features that command a premium, which could be as high as 10 per cent. These valuations punish good-quality developers who are innovative and rely on the premium for financial viability.'</p> <p>There has been a similar suspension of 'normal' valuation techniques in the recent past. In 2006 there were vast over-supplies of new flats in some regenerated city centres, notably Leeds. There were also allegations that some valuers colluded with builders to inflate values artificially. However, that problem was localised, short-lived and did not spread beyond city centres.</p> <p>Some believe that Nationwide's blanket down-valuing policy risks fuelling the downward trend in its own house-price index. This is produced monthly and is regarded by some commentators as a key influence on the interest rate decisions of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee. </p> <p>The index is compiled from all mortgage offers made by the society in the preceding month. If newbuild homes are sold based on 'low' mortgage offers, the deals feed into the index process, in theory forcing averages down even further than current market conditions would justify. </p> <p>Last week's figures from the Nationwide suggested that average UK house prices were down 12.4 per cent over the past year, while the Land Registry - which covers all house and flat sales, albeit only across England and Wales - shows the fall as only 4.6 per cent. </p> <p>'We need to take into account the dynamics of the market. Prices are going down and it's resale value we consider most important,' says Nationwide's chief economist, Fionnuala Earley. 'Newbuild homes only account for 8 per cent of transactions over a year, so it's a small proportion of the overall index. Valuation isn't an exact science and it's particularly difficult in the current market.' </p> <p>Sceptics are unconvinced. 'The market should decide the value of a house or flat, not a rule from a lender. No lender is doing this on secondhand homes, where they accept what the market decides. So why are some doing it to new homes?' asks mortgage broker Lee Holland. 'The result is that getting a mortgage on a new home is becoming a complete lottery.'</p>",
  "<h2>Assisted suicide is not an answer</h2> <p>Catherine Bennett suggests that objections to legalising assisted suicide are based on religious grounds ('Let this woman die as she chooses, not in a death plant', Comment, last week). Yet 94 per cent of specialist palliative care physicians oppose euthanasia and assisted suicide.</p> <p>We wish to protect and conserve the dignity of all dying patients, who may feel depressed, a burden to others or fear future pain. Research shows that if patients approaching death are treated as if they no longer matter, they will act and believe that life is not worth living. </p> <p>A law permitting assisted suicide would be a message to vulnerable dying patients that they were no longer valued. A society that endorses assisted suicide is inevitably less committed to care of the dying. A society that rejects assisted suicide and embraces palliative care expresses its valuing of people until the end of their lives.</p> <p>The current law is not 'barbaric'; it protects not only doctors and nurses who are free to talk to patients about their fears, but also thousands of vulnerable patients. Bennett dismisses 'euthanasia scare stories', but I find Mary Warnock's linkage of euthanasia for dementia suffers with the saving of NHS resources pretty scary too.<br><strong>Dr David Jeffrey</strong><br>Honorary Senior Lecturer in Palliative Medicine<br>University of Edinburgh</p> <p>Catherine Bennett writes from the point of view of a valued member of society. She has no understanding of what it means to be regarded as useless and unwanted. Elderly and frail people are already subjected to the psychological abuse of an indifferent society, but to give families and carers the protection of the law to, in effect, bully their 'loved' ones into taking their lives would be a true horror.<br><strong>Dr Stephane Duckett</strong><br>London SE11</p> <h2>My nest egg's cracked</h2> <p>Among victims of the financial crash is a group of big losers without any compensation: banks' staff members.</p> <p>I am a bank pensioner and in the last decades of employment I was encouraged by successive Chancellors to invest in my employer through profit-sharing schemes and Save As You Earn. I built up a nest egg to see me through retirement. Now my nest egg has gone, but I do have a company pension which I hope is solvent. If not, I and hundreds of thousands of staff members are as much victims as anyone else.<br><strong>Brian Robinson</strong><br>Brentwood, Essex</p> <h2>Neither my words nor views</h2> <p> A book review which appeared under my byline (The Way of the World: A Story of Truth and Hope in an Age of Extremism by Ron Suskind, Review, last week) ascribed to me views which I do not hold.</p> <p>I did not assert simplistically that the book 'is an expos\u00e9 of how both the Bush and Blair governments knew that Iraq did not possess weapons of mass destruction, but none the less still went to war', but described it, with deliberate cynicism, as 'a supposedly explosive expos\u00e9' which claimed that. Nor did I write any words remotely resembling: 'Since 9/11, Suskind has focused his attention on George Bush's White House, laying bare the inefficiencies and duplicities of the current administration in two bestsellers' - again an opinion of Suskind's work with which, to put it mildly, I do not concur.</p> <p>Nor I did not write: 'Suskind's revelations about the CIA being behind the forged letter [between the head of Iraqi intelligence and Saddam Hussein] are, on the other hand, a genuine journalistic slam dunk and on their own would make this book an important piece of investigative reporting.' </p> <p>In fact, Suskind made no such surprise new revelations; it was already known that such a forged letter existed and widely assumed that the CIA was behind it. I actually wrote: 'I am not convinced by Suskind's account of it being drafted on \"creamy\" White House stationery', which was, in fact, the author's 'bombshell' claim.</p> <p>Your readers should therefore know that my review was considerably more critical of Suskind's 'novelistic non-fiction' than the version you published.<br><strong>Andrew Stephen</strong><br>Washington DC</p> <h2>Great tribute to Paul Newman</h2> <p>I do not know whether Newman was at 'peace with death' from reading Sam Mendes's wonderful article (News, last week). I consider that anyone who was the subject of such a moving and warm tribute would have all the attributes of a great human being. I felt moved by the description of how Conrad Hall, the cinematographer, observed the effects of ageing on Newman, as it made me recall seeing my father's decline. <br><strong>Andy White</strong><br>Towcester, Northamptonshire</p> <h2>Dubai is not all dubious</h2> <p>Just because Ms Cadwalladr met some disgruntled expats does not mean that everyone in Dubai is miserable, alcoholic or that the city is a disastrous place to live ('Desert storm', OM, last week). We are a normal family, with two children in school, doing normal jobs and enjoying our life here. Yes, as in any big city, there is a 'seedy underworld' but not all of us belong to it. Some of us enjoy the beach, swim in the sea and feel safe in this multicultural city.<br><strong>Caroline Tapken</strong><br>Dubai</p> <h2>Junk food for thought</h2> <p>Robert Yates ('Don't blame Jamie for a nation's ills', Comment, last week) assumes personal responsibility can be exerted against the flow of misinformation dispersed by the food industry. His statement that 'you'd have to be an idiot of the highest order not to clock that... in Britain life chances are still hugely determined by the lottery of birth' tellingly betrays a lack of awareness about other segments of society. TV and the tabloid press are the dominant gatekeepers of information for many people, who absorb and internalise their rhetoric of meritocracy, propagated by the same agencies that depict Pot Noodles and Turkey Twizzlers as real food.<br><strong>Joel Hartley</strong><br>Leeds</p> <h2>Speaking in tongue</h2> <p>Your article 'Barrow, blue-collar capital of Britain' (News, last week) took me back to a weekend in the early Seventies when, as a middle-class southern girl, I went north to meet my future mother-in-law. Walney Island's back-to-back terrace housing had been built to accommodate the shipyard workers, and she lived in one of these homes.</p> <p>On the Saturday evening at the working men's club, there was an elimination dance when couples had to sit down if they answered 'yes' to any of the caller's questions. To the locals' amusement, I had to ask my partner whether he was 'on a promise tonight', as I had no idea what it meant.</p> <p>I had been invited to visit groups of relatives on the Sunday.

  "<p>There invariably comes a time - or in my case, many times - when one takes a long, hard look at oneself and asks the tough questions: 'Why?', 'Whither?' 'Wherefore?', and my favourite, the hopelessly rhetorical 'WTF?'*</p> <p>Most weeks are a bit 'WTF?', which is an inevitable by-product of living alone (but for two small children and a Slovakian au pair) in a small town devoid of close friends, spending inordinate amounts of time in front of TV screens and computer monitors, randomly connecting to, and swiftly disconnecting from, the outside world while making stuff up for a living. </p> <p>I have, however (as I've recently mentioned), been hauled out of my home-alone comfort zone to make a TV series, which - thrillingly - involved working with a big team. I was almost drunk on the novelty of being surrounded by all those people talking - around me, to me, occasionally even about me - all day, to the point where it felt a bit like going back to school, learning to navigate one's way through the metaphorical corridors, working out which books you needed for which lessons and if your brand-new best friend was still going to like you at four o'clock. Out of practice for the past decade, I loved the collaborative process so much I would gladly have volunteered for detention.</p> <p>But making a TV show is, patently, a fairly extreme simulacrum of ordinary human interaction. If the majority of the conversations you're having are being recorded, they invariably end up as insanely caffeinated versions of 'real' conversations, artificially stimulated, high on E numbers and aspartame. Still, those of us who don't get out much happily take what we can get and I'd rather have a 'conversation' I have to repeat three times for technical purposes than the kind of skewed internal dialogues I rely on the rest of the time.</p> <p>Sitting here at home, in silence (I hardly ever write in silence - I play music loud, but my speakers have decided they only want to whisper rather than shout), I currently find myself grappling with equally weird WTF?nesses in the non-sequitur-laden conversational cul-de-sacs of email and text, on which - alongside the quasi-sociability of networking sites - the isolated home-alone worker tends to rely a bit too heavily to ease them through the day. </p> <p>Given that my email address is at the end of this column, people are invited to parachute themselves in and out of my life at any time. However, a few weeks ago I received a message from somebody who somehow inveigled themselves a niche in the daily displacement-activity folderol of coffee drinking, internal dialoguing and even writing. Soon enough, by being interesting and intriguing and distracting, they had filled a space I hadn't even known was there ... and then, of course, just when I'd begun to rely on the space being filled, they were gone. </p> <p>Ironically, electronic communication predicated on the juxtaposition of zeros and ones is the perfect, and perfectly seductive, method of communication for anybody who tots up words for a living, but just like those conducted with microphones attached and cameras pointed at you, it's foolish to pretend that these 'conversations' have anything in common with real ones. Self-conscious, self-selecting and subject to stringent self-editing, they are mere versions of truths, offering illusions of intimacy and degrees of control to the kind of people for whom intimacy and control may be almost as seductive as words.</p> <p>It's amazing how easy it is to communicate with somebody when the sheer fact of communicating at all is enough to distract you from what is being said. Naively, I felt I got to know my new friend pretty well, but retrospectively that was entirely about context. When they disappeared without explanation, I realised I hadn't really known them at all, but even grasping this fact intellectually did little to dissipate the weird feeling of loss and mourning, of being hurt. The fact remains I 'lost' something and somebody I had never actually had, so how is it that, ever since, I've been beating myself up with a big bunch of Whys?, Whithers? Wherefores? and WTFs?

  "<h2>Budget</h2> <p><strong>Waldstein 108 DI; </strong><strong>\u00a31,695 RRP</strong></p> <p>Former \"piano of the year\", this small, Chinese-manufactured instrument has a pleasing sound that, unlike some cheaper imports, is not overly bright or incredibly mellow. With its size, sturdy action and even tone throughout, this would be great for anyone starting out.</p> <p><strong>Acoustic pianos</strong></p> <p>If your budget allows, buy a new piano. The music press and local dealers will be full of pianos for sale, but before you make a final decision, always seek the advice of an expert. As a first port of call, the Piano Advisory Service (<a href=\"http://www.pianoadvice.org.uk\">pianoadvice.org.uk</a>) offers excellent advice. </p> <p>If you have a piano teacher or tuner, ask them for the makes or models they recommend. They're often best placed to point you in the direction of good-quality, trouble-free instruments. If buying from a high-street dealer, make sure it's a reputable one. Good dealers will try to be as helpful and flexible as they can, and most should be able to offer you a manufacturer-backed guarantee. And remember: not just anyone can move a piano. If you buy from a dealer, they should be able to suggest a specialist firm that will do this for you.</p> <p>Always try before you buy and make sure you're happy with both the tone and the appearance of the instrument. Be realistic about where the instrument will go - acoustic pianos don't like direct or fluctuating temperatures, and they need to live somewhere that doesn't interfere with your (or your neighbours') lifestyle.</p> <p><strong>Markson M110; </strong><strong>\u00a31,795 RRP</strong></p> <p>Another solidly built Chinese-made piano at the lower end of the market, the M110 is brighter-toned than the Waldstein and, with the addition of a third \"practice\" pedal, makes it possible to play without disturbing the neighbours. A great entry-level piano that will see many a keen amateur pianist through those early grades.</p> <h2>Mid-price</h2> <p><strong>Kemble Conservatoire; </strong><strong>\u00a34,999 RRP</strong></p> <p>The Conservatoire model, with its sleek soft-line design, has a beautiful sound and a large dynamic range, while its long keys and precision manufactured action ensure increased sensitivity and a greater responsiveness of touch. What's more, it's available as a \"silent piano\" option with MIDI capability too, allowing links to your computer and total privacy if you want to feed the sound through headphones.</p> <p><strong>Petrof P118; </strong><strong>\u00a36,999 RRP</strong></p> <p>For the more advanced player, the P118 has always been a popular choice with its solid European-build and wide dynamic sound that is both rich and pure. The keys are individually balanced, the action gives a quick response and you get a greater control of tone. All in all, it's an attractive piano available in a range of different finishes - a welcome addition to any home or music studio.</p> <h2>Dream machine</h2> <p><strong>Bosendorfer 290 Imperial; </strong><strong>\u00a398,000 RRP</strong></p> <p>A grand or an upright? The choice comes down to space and budget. Because the strings are longer in a grand piano, you get a much greater depth, control and volume of sound. Established makes can be astronomically expensive, so emphasis with this model is very much on the \"dream\"...</p> <p>At a staggering 9ft 6in, the beautifully crafted Imperial is the only instrument in the world to have 97 keys (eight full octaves), nine more than standard pianos, allowing for the faithful performance of works by Bartok, Debussy, Ravel and Busoni. Anyone who's played on one comments on their huge, orchestral-like sound, which explains their presence in some of the world's finest concert halls. For a little extra money (\u00a3165,000 to be exact - hey, who's counting at this level?), you could opt for the Porsche-designed model, a masterly combination of form and function.</p>",
  "<p>It was the turn of another of last season's relegated teams to reach the top of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/leagueonefootball\">League One</a>, as <strong>Scunthorpe</strong> moved ahead of Leicester on goals scored with their 3-0 win over <strong>Crewe.</strong> It increased Scunthorpe's unbeaten league run to nine matches, eight of which have been victories.</p> <p>One feature of their set-up in recent years has been the way in which they have helped promising young strikers develop their ability. <strong>Leeds United</strong>'s Jermaine Beckford, who scored twice in the 3-1 win over <strong>Brighton</strong> to take his goal total for the season to 13 in 14 matches, had a spell on loan there two seasons ago.

The latest is 20-year-old Gary Hooper, who was signed from Southend in July - much to the disappointment of Hereford manager Graham Turner. </p> <p>Recalling the part Hooper played in Hereford's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/leaguetwofootball\">League Two</a> promotion success last season - on loan - Turner says: 'Gary Hooper will always be a threat to any team at League One level and I think it would be the same in the Championship. He's a good finisher - and not only that, he has an excellent appreciation of what is around him.'</p> <p>There was further evidence of this yesterday, when he set up two of the Scunthorpe goals (Izzie Iriekpen is pictured celebrating scoring their third). The other key performer was winger Martyn Woolford. </p> <p>Like Leeds, <strong>Millwall</strong> also narrowed the gap between the top two and themselves to two points by winning 3-1 at <strong>Tranmere</strong> - their sixth win in seven matches. Tresor Kandol, who is on loan from Leeds, scored twice. </p> <p>The most stunning performance was at <strong>Cheltenham</strong>, where the home team provided another example of the extent to which their unorthodox new manager Martin Allen can galvanise players as they fought back from 1-0 and then 3-1 down against <strong>Colchester</strong> to win 4-3. Barry Hayles, one of the Football League's oldest players at 36, scored their fourth goal in stoppage time. </p> <p>In the televised match, <strong>Carlisle</strong> slumped to their fifth successive league defeat as they allowed <strong>MK Dons</strong> to come from behind to overcome them 3-1. Carlisle manager John Ward had hoped that the signing of 34-year-old Graham Kavanagh on loan from Sunderland would help bring a greater measure of authority and composure to his team. However, with Kavanagh not having made any previous first-team appearances this season, his influence was overshadowed by that of the Dons' Scottish midfielder Peter Leven. Leven scored their equaliser with a shot from the edge of the penalty area, took the corner from which Miguel Angel Llera put the Dons ahead and scored their other goal from a penalty. </p> <p>With <strong>Bury</strong> losing 1-0 at home to <strong>Exeter</strong> - which took some of the gloss off the midweek news that the sell-on fee they received through David Nugent's transfer from Preston to Portsmouth had enabled them to make a \u00a31.2m profit on the past financial year and pay off all their debts - the only team with an unbeaten league record now are <strong>Wycombe</strong>. Thrashed 7-0 by Shrewsbury in the Johnstone's Paint Trophy in midweek - one of the surprise results of the season, even though a number of their key men were missing - they came from behind for a 1-1 draw at <strong>Grimsby</strong>. It was Mike Newell's first league match as Grimsby manager and his team's run without a league win was stretched to 17 matches. What made it a particularly disappointing afternoon for him was that Wycombe's Tommy Doherty was sent off four minutes from the end, but the visitors managed to draw level through Leon Johnson in the last minute. </p> <p>Ironically, <strong>Shrewsbury </strong>were on the receiving end of one of the day's surprises, as they were brought back down to earth with a 2-1 home defeat by <strong>Port Vale</strong>. True, they were without Grant Holt, the scorer of five goals against Wycombe, but it was some performance by Vale, given that Lee Collins was sent off for a second bookable offence shortly after Shrewsbury had made the score 1-1. That equaliser came in the third minute of stoppage time, but Vale's captain Marc Richards brought his team victory three minutes later. Vale manager Dean Glover pointed out: afterwards 'We restricted them to fewer goal efforts than they usually manage.' </p>",
  "<p><strong>The following correction was printed in the Observer's For the record column, Sunday October 19 2008</strong></p> <p> In the article below we said that the Sinn Fein representatives of the hunger strikers and 'blanket men' were 'censored in the media, with actors voicing their statements on the nightly TV news'. But the broadcast ban was introduced by then Home Secretary Douglas Hurd in October 1988. McQueen's film, Hunger, is set during the 1981 hunger strike. This has been corrected. </p> <p> </p> <p>The most visceral scene in Hunger, Steve McQueen's austere film about the IRA martyr Bobby Sands, shows a group of naked detainees being forced to run a gauntlet of baton-welding prison officers in full riot gear. It is a moment of sustained, ritualistic violence in a work that is characterised by its poetic tone and slow, cumulative power.</p> <p>When McQueen talks about the scene, something happens to him. He becomes suddenly voluble, agitated to the point of inarticulacy. 'We had to do five takes,' he says, shaking his head furiously as if trying to expunge the memory from his consciousness, 'and each time the actors were actually being beaten with the truncheons because, well, there was really no other way to do it and make it look convincing. At one point, I looked at the monitor, which I hardly ever do, and what I was seeing suddenly became real. It was real! Not film. Not fake. Real. I jumped up and started shouting: \"No! No! Cut! We have to stop. Just cut, cut! Stop this now!\"'</p> <p>As he tells me this, his whole being seems to be grappling with the emotional fallout of that unsettling moment. He stares at his hands for a while. Then, after a few seconds, he says: 'See, the thing was, I was in control of this violence. I was in control of these men being beaten with batons. It was down to me. Me! I was in control of what was happening.'</p> <p>I ask him what happened next. Did they call it a day? 'No. No,' he says, animated again, 'I wanted to but the actors insisted on doing another take. We were really close. And we did another take. And we got it. By then, I was losing it. I just walked away. I had to get out of there. All this emotion just welled up inside me.'</p> <p>McQueen hurried off the set to the bemusement of his crew, one of whom followed him thinking he was dissatisfied with the shoot. 'He realised I was upset and he left me alone,' says McQueen. 'That's when I started sobbing. I just lost it. It got to me. The fucker got to me. I mean, I'm a big guy. I never even cried at my father's funeral. But, suddenly, I was crying like a baby.'</p> <p>Why does he think that particular scene affected him so deeply? 'Don't you understand?' he says, sounding suddenly impatient.'It was real. And it was awful. You could feel the brutality of what the prisoners had to go through. It was a glimpse of the awful, brutal reality of the H Blocks. It was like we had crossed a line and all of a sudden we were dancing with ghosts.'</p> <p>In person, McQueen is a formidable presence, one of those big, burly guys who can alter the atmosphere of a room by entering it. Which is exactly what he does when he strides into the ornate surroundings of an elaborately decorated lounge in the Soho Hotel in London, where I have been summoned to meet him. Initially, he seems a little awkward in his own skin, but that may just be a manifestation of the unease he feels when he has to explain himself.</p> <p>At times, he comes across as defensive-going-on-combative and he occasionally struggles to find the right words, growing visibly impatient with himself when they won't come. There is something slightly haughty and oddly vulnerable about him. You can see why he would be unsettled by the idea that his own emotional security could be breached in the pursuit of his art, which tends towards the formal, controlled and uncompromising.</p> <p>A friend of mine from Northern Ireland, who has seen Hunger, said McQueen had 'pulled off the impossible' by 'making an art film about the IRA'. When I mention the term 'art film', McQueen thows me a fierce look. 'I don't know what you mean by that,' he says. 'What I tried to do was make the strongest, most powerful film I could from the events and the story. It may not have the conventional narrative of most feature films but that is my way of grappling with the subject. Art has absolutely nothing to do with it.'</p> <p>Hunger, despite, or maybe because of, its formal purity, is an unsettling film and does indeed dance with ghosts. It takes you inside one of the infamous H Blocks of the Maze. You remain there throughout apart from a few short interludes, one of which is also brutally shocking in its violence. The film utilises the three-act structure of a Greek tragedy. The first part evokes the claustrophobic and violent atmosphere inside the prison block during the prolonged dirty protest that led up to the hunger strike. The second act is a long breathing space, which takes the form of a 22-minute real-time discussion between Sands and a Catholic priest (a beautifully pitched performance from Liam Cunningham) about the morality of self-starvation. Brilliantly written by Enda Walsh, it is compelling, despite its length. The third act observes Sands's 66-day descent into emaciation and eventual death. In the preview screening I attended, the audience left the theatre in utter silence.</p> <p>'I always had this rhythm in my head, where the film was like a river and the landscape around it,' says McQueen, 'Then, all of a sudden, you're on this rapid and the landscape is fractured, things are not exactly what they seem any more, then there's a kind of waterfall. So, essentially, you're being taken downstream, then your reality is being questioned, then the slow fall.'</p> <p>The film is defined by McQueen's uncompromising directorial style which, in its accrual of telling details - a jailer's grazed and swollen knuckles, a fly on a metal grille - and its poetic slowness, possesses a cumulative power that, by the end, is almost overwhelmingly intense.</p> <p>'I watched it with three friends and it was just a shattering experience,' says Danny Morrison, the writer and Republican activist from west Belfast, who acted as an intermediary between the hunger strikers and the leaders of Sinn Fein at the time, and visited Sands throughout his fast. 'You really get an idea of the brutality of the state and the prison officers, a brutality that was dismissed at the time as Republican propaganda. I really hope people go and see it, because it asks a fundamental question that is being asked again in Guant\u00e1namo Bay: is it morally right to treat people in captivity as if they were not human?'</p> <p>At its centre, Hunger features an extraordinary performance by the young German-Irish actor Michael Fassbender as Bobby Sands. Fassbender fasted for 10 weeks under medical supervision before the third part of the film was shot on a closed set. 'He committed himself totally to the part, and I think it changed him somehow,' says McQueen. 'He became very inward, very philosophical. At one point, he became like Bob Marley in a way, philosophising about the meaning of life and shit. I was like, what the fuck is going on here?'</p> <p>When Hunger won the Camera d'Or for Best First Film at Cannes, Fassbender talked to Channel 4 News about the role and said: 'Whatever your feelings about their political views and what they had done to get into that situation in prison, killings and atrocities, what they did was extraordinary. To starve yourself to death? I couldn't do it.'</p> <p>Some people may argue that Hunger never grapples with the wider context of the Troubles, nor does it engage with the killings and atrocities that were carried out in the name of Republicanism. It presumes a level of knowledge on the part of the audience that is rare in contemporary cinema - but this is both a strength of the film and a limitation. In the final part, in which the skeletal Sands falls into fitful reveries and remembrances, there are hallucinatory scenes of his childhood that struck me as the only false note in a film that otherwise eschews any kind of easy romanticism. Did he worry that his film could be construed as a homage to a certain strain of Republican fanaticism, or indeed any kind of political fanaticism that calls for blood sacrifice and martyrdom from its followers?</p> <p>'No, I never think of things like that,' he says. 'Maybe I'm weird but that's not what is on my mind when I look at a subject like this. I am thinking about what I am doing and how best to do it.' Did he, in making the film, identify with Sands and his cause? 'Well, I've obviously never been in a situation like that. I'm not an Irish nationalist; I'm not a black South African. I essentially identify with both sides in the Irish conflict. I show what prisoner officers did, but also what they went through. I can see why they did the job. It was incredibly well-paid and there was not much work about. And they were brutalised, too. And many of them were murdered by the IRA. I show that, too.' He pauses again, struggling to find the words. 'It's difficult, it's difficult, it's incredibly problematic, but I am an artist. I have no answers to the bigger political questions.'</p> <p>The historical context of McQueen's film, which is never spelt out, is the IRA hunger strike of 1981 and the so-called dirty protest that preceded it. That protest was made in pursuit of special category status, the IRA's demand that its convicted members be allowed, among other things, to wear their own clothes instead of the standard prison uniform and not to do prison work. </p> <p>The 'blanket men', as the protesting prisoners came to be known, pursued a long and dogged campaign of passive resistance, refusing to wear prison uniforms, wash, or slop out, and smearing their excrement on the walls and doors of their cells.</p> <p>Their demands were brushed aside by an intransigent Margaret Thatcher. Only a single 90-second snatch of film exists of conditions inside the H Blocks at the time, shot by an Ulster Television camera crew for a documentary that was subsequently banned by the government. It shows two prisoners, bedraggled and Christ-like, wrapped in dirty blankets, shouting out their demands from a filthy, excrement encrusted cell. From that image, the artist Richard Hamilton created the first work of art based on the H Blocks, a painting called The Citizen, which he completed in 1983. Twenty-five years later, with several former IRA men now sitting in the Northern Ireland Assembly, McQueen has created the second.</p> <p>'What initially brought me to the subject was the notion of what an individual is capable of doing just in order to be heard,' he says. 'I remember, as a kid, seeing Bobby Sands's image on the news every night and this number underneath, which, I later found out, corresponded to the number of days he had gone without food. That somehow stayed with me. People say, \"Oh, it's a political film\", but, for me, it's essentially about what we, as humans, are capable of, morally, physically, psychologically. What we will inflict and what we can endure.'</p> <p>McQueen lives in Amsterdam but he grew up in Ealing, west London, the son of West Indian immigrants. His father worked for London Transport and his mother was a nurse. As a teenager, he says, he was encouraged to 'get a trade'. He did well at school and says his interest in art 'initially manifested itself solely in the idea of getting an education'.</p> <p>He ended up at Goldsmiths, University of London, where, though unhappy with the theoretical thrust of the tutors, he obtained a first-class degree. 'I thought they had only one way of looking at things and I knew there was never only one way of looking at things,' he says, sighing. He later attended New York University's film school, but was unhappier still. 'I hated it,' he says. 'It was full of all these rich kids who could afford the fees. It was nothing to do with talent.'</p> <p>McQueen, you sense, is essentially an outsider, someone whose work possesses a formal rigour which seems to be his unique way of making sense of often-difficult subject matter. His early short films were formally experimental and thematically elusive. In Deadpan, the closest he has come to comedy, he paid homage to Buster Keaton by standing stock still while the gable wall of a building collapsed around him. In another, Drumroll, which earned him the Turner Prize nomination, he pushed an oil drum through New York, with three cameras attached to it, each recording the city streets in perpetual revolution, while his polite but stentorian voice shouted out 'Excuse me!' and 'Sorry!' at baffled pedestrians.</p> <p>I ask him if his films emerge, however obliquely, out of self-exploration? Are they essentially about his own inner struggles? 'God, no!' he shouts, startling both myself and the two hotel guests sitting opposite us. 'Don't even mention that in a newspaper. You cannot. I mean, come on! I'm not that selfish. I have never been interested in me. What I'm interested in is not I, it's we. Always. It's we: our history, our culture, whatever makes us who we are and informs how we act.'</p> <p>Though he won the Turner Prize in 1999, McQueen is best known in this country as a campaigning war artist, having travelled to Iraq in 2003. He says his short time there was 'difficult and incredibly frustrating'. The outcome was a work called Queen and Country, in which he proposes that all the British servicemen who died in Iraq be commemorated on postage stamps. The campaign to convince the Post Office to make the work a reality continues apace and McQueen tells me that, having elicited the support of most of the dead soldiers' families, he recently had a meeting with the Prime Minister to discuss the project.</p> <p>'I even received a thumbs-up from the Daily Mail,' he says, laughing. 'Millimetre by millimetre, inch by inch, we are getting closer. Seven out of 10 people in the UK want the stamps to be produced. It's hard to argue with that. Ultimately, too, it's a whole lot more effective than erecting some bronze statue in a corner of London.'</p> <p>McQueen sees no contradiction between the role of war artist who wants to commemorate the deaths of British soldiers in Iraq and film-maker who, some might say, makes a hero of Bobby Sands, the romantic figurehead of a terrorist organisation that waged a fitful guerrilla war on the British army with often deadly results.</p> <p>'I go where my work leads me,' he says, 'and try to explore the subject matter as imaginatively as I can. What was going on in the H Blocks was so big and yet it was swept under the carpet. People talk passionately about the abuses in Abu Ghraib, but the same thing was happening here in our own backyard. The hunger strike was one of the biggest political events in Britain in recent history. But it's already forgotten over here, swept aside. That's how Britain operates.'</p> <p>There is a kind of controlled rage underpinning the film, generated by at the brutality that became a kind of normality in the H Blocks. That brutality undoubtedly fuelled the bloody war of attrition raging outside the prison walls. A French journalist who interviewed McQueen recently suggested his film should have been called 'Anger' rather than Hunger. You can see what he was getting at. </p> <p>'I'm essentially quite happy,' he says, 'but, for some reason, I have done a lot of stuff that is dark. I don't know why that is and I don't question it. I don't really think you have a choice where you go as an artist. I mean, I would love to make a comedy, I really would.' Does he think that might happen? 'No,' he says, erupting, for the first time today, into hearty laughter. 'No, I wouldn't hold your breath waiting for that one.' </p> <p>\u2022 Hunger opens on 31 October</p> <h2>McQueen: Life Story</h2> <p><strong>Life: </strong>Born in 1969 to West Indian immigrant parents, he grew up in west London.

  "<p>Amid all the reckless gambling of recent years, British banks did make one sound bet: they guessed that they were so vital to the economy that politicians would never let them fail. </p> <p>Sure enough, as crunch turned to crisis and crisis turned to panic, the Prime Minister and the Chancellor last week announced a rescue package of breathtaking scale: \u00a350bn to rebuild banks' capital stores; at least \u00a3200bn of cash available through the Bank of England's 'special liquidity scheme'; a guarantee worth \u00a3250bn of further borrowing by banks on wholesale money markets. </p> <p>It was the right thing to do. Since the economy depends on a flow of capital from banks to businesses and households, and because mutual distrust has stopped banks lending to each other, it falls to governments to put money back into the system.</p> <p>While the US Treasury was faster to act in a manner appropriate to the scale of the crisis, the British response is smarter. The American plan, worth $700bn, was essentially to purchase toxic debt from failing banks - turning the taxpayer into the buyer of last resort for assets that the market had rejected. The UK approach puts money closer to the heart of the problem, pouring capital directly on to bank balance sheets and taking part ownership in return. Instead of bailing water out of the leaky vessel, Alistair Darling and Gordon Brown are trying to plug the leak. </p> <p>Given the global nature of the crisis, the British initiative will only work if the rest of the world follows suit. Henry Paulson, US Treasury Secretary, said last week that he was prepared to do just that. The US government may now invest directly in the nation's banks for the first time since the 1930s. </p> <p>European governments have been less ambitious, some because they prefer to deal with bank failures on an ad hoc basis, and some because they doubt the crisis will hit them as hard as it has the 'Anglo-Saxons'. They are mistaken. No financial institution is safe. Only a systemic rescue will stabilise the situation. Politicians cannot wait for the market to signal trouble and then react; they must wrest control of the economy away from panic-stricken markets. </p> <p>But bankers resist government involvement in their affairs with something like religious zealotry and the Brown-Darling rescue plan contains no clear strategy for bringing them to heel. The Prime Minister said that public investment will come 'with strings attached', but added that the detail would be negotiated on a case-by-case basis. </p> <p>It is asking too much of taxpayers to put their money up front without explaining what they will get in return. Some concessions should be non-negotiable. </p> <p>First, the banks should accept the presence of a government official or civil servant on their boards of directors and remunerations committees. The banks will need constant reminding that they owe their survival to public money and that they should start running their businesses with more respect for the public interest. </p> <p>Second, the banks should not treat the government's equity stake like a simple loan. They cannot expect that, when the current crisis has passed, government will step back from its investment without extracting a profit. Having part-nationalised the banks, the state must manage its shareholding to yield the best return for the taxpayer. </p> <p>Third, the banks must not hoard their new capital. The rescue is only justified if it brings liquidity back to the economy. That means lending on the High Street again. </p> <p>That is the minimum required to make the package palatable to voters. It would be a fair exchange for government ramping up the national debt, blasting a hole in its spending plans and facing down public rage at the sight of rich financiers piling into state-sponsored lifeboats while everyone else must swim through the coming recession or sink in it.</p> <p>Having stabilised the banking sector, the government will have to embark on wider reform of the City. It must make financial services more transparent, more accountable and subservient to the wider economy.</p> <p>That means, for example, curtailing the anonymous trade in complex securities and derivatives. Those arcane instruments are at the heart of the current crisis because they were used to disguise liability for debt defaults - spreading hidden risk across the global system. If they are to survive at all, they should be swapped on a regulated exchange, where traders are identifiable and their accounts open to scrutiny. </p> <p>The rating agencies, which failed to identify how risky many widely traded assets were, must also be reformed. The conflict of interest whereby the agencies take fees from the banks whose investments they are supposed to analyse must be addressed.</p> <p>The banks must separate their investment and retail arms. They must decide whether they want to be taking deposits and lending to customers or managing funds and speculating on financial markets. They must also be forced to maintain healthy ratios of capital to debt - storing cash during a boom so they can lend in a downturn. </p> <p>None of that can be achieved without the banks' co-operation. But there seems little prospect of that when the bankers are not showing any remorse. While politicians are accountable at the ballot box, the bankers face no equivalent public judgment. While the Chancellor and the Prime Minister take to the airwaves to defend their actions, City bosses have gone to ground. Not one executive has owned up to presiding over a catastrophe, apologised and resigned. No bankers have put themselves in a public forum to explain, for example, why they deserved to be paid multimillion pound bonuses for decisions that led to the biggest economic crisis in living memory, or what drove them to make those decisions, if not arrogance and greed. </p> <p>If the bankers will not volunteer to give an account of themselves, they must be compelled to do so before a public inquiry. It will take a forensic examination of how this crisis came about to design a regulatory system to prevent it being repeated. It will also take some show of contrition by bankers before public confidence and trust in the financial system can be restored. </p> <p>For a generation, politicians have taken orders from the City, creating tax breaks and cutting regulation lest the captains of global finance flee to softer jurisdictions abroad. Some bankers think their power will not diminish. Some have even complained that the government was not quick enough to respond to their needs, that Mr Brown and Mr Darling 'dithered'. That cry for help marks an abrupt change in tone from the old demands for freedom from interference.</p> <p>The City seems to believe it can turn to the state for aid in a crisis and the return to business as usual. Wrong. The bankers also seem to think they enjoy indefinite protection by the dwindling band of politicians, mostly Conservatives, who still opine on the benefits of deregulation and gigantic pay incentives for the City. Wrong again.</p> <p>With \u00a3500bn of taxpayers' money keeping them afloat, the banks are in no position to be giving orders, nor to be paying themselves exorbitant sums. With public money must come public accountability. The banks thought they were too big for politicians to let them fail and they were right. But if voters get no explanation and nothing in return for their money, their fury will be too great for politicians to ignore.</p>",
  "<h2>APRIL 2008</h2> <p><strong>The readthrough: Central Baptist Church, Shaftesbury Avenue, London WC2</strong> </p> <p>The Central Baptist Church has a massive solidity about it, presiding benignly over the scurrying masses below. Inside the rather drab foyer, kind ladies offer directions while down-and-outs lounge about waiting for help and handouts. All pleasingly Dickensian, I'm thinking, as the cage-like lift doors clang shut and we grind upwards. But we're not here for the atmosphere. We're here because there's a room big enough to hold the readthrough - there are 80 speaking parts in Little Dorrit, and most of the actors are here today. If the roof fell in, it would be a tragedy for the English theatre. </p> <p>Most actors hate readthroughs - they're exposing themselves before they're ready to, and before they've bonded. But I love them because they give us all the first inkling of what the whole show is going to be like, how each part affects every other part, and we won't see that again until it's all edited together. I love it also because I am part of the performance: I read all the stage directions, and do my best to give a sense of the pace and liveliness we are looking for. I feel like the conductor of a great orchestra. And I know it's the last time I can feel in control. From tomorrow, when filming starts, Little Dorrit belongs to the directors, cast and crew. </p> <p>It's a good readthrough. Tom Courtenay has arrived all fired up, as though he's been waiting all his life to play Mr Dorrit - surely a role well up there with anything in Chekhov or Shakespeare. He really goes for it: he is funny, pathetic, maudlin, capable of frightening rage, heartbreakingly tender, and the other actors hastily raise their game in response. There's a lot of laughter and a good round of spontaneous applause at the end. All that remains is to make the bloody thing. </p> <h2>18 MONTHS EARLIER</h2> <p><strong>E &amp; O restaurant, London W11</strong></p> <p>I'm having dinner with the BBC's Jane Tranter. The food is Asian fusion, and I let her do all the ordering. It generally works out best that way. Bleak House has done very well, and Jane would like another Dickens. Which one? I suggest Dombey and Son or Little Dorrit, and Jane plumps for Little Dorrit. It's a deal, just like that. I never ask why she went for Dorrit rather than Dombey. Maybe because it's got a girl in the title? </p> <p>We talk around the crucial questions: why this, why now? There's the BBC charter angle: we'll be bringing a little-known masterpiece to a popular audience. And Little Dorrit asks the big questions: how are we to live our lives? What do we owe our parents? What do we owe ourselves? How do we find love, and how will we know it? How can we be true to ourselves and survive in a ruthless world? The world of Little Dorrit has many resonances with our own. Honest businessmen struggle while City financiers spin money out of nothing. The institutions of government, epitomised in the Office of Circumlocution, are complacent, incompetent, uncaring. Everyone's drowning in debt. Plenty to get our teeth into. We'll be searingly relevant. But, secretly, it's the wonderful characters I'm looking forward to. All the comedy and heartbreak. And so's Jane. </p> <h2>JANUARY 2007 </h2> <p><strong>Antigua </strong></p> <p>This is where I start work on Little Dorrit. (Well, if you're a writer you can work anywhere.) I'm on holiday, soaking up the sun, but I set aside two hours each afternoon to wrestle the book into shape. It's a rich and complicated story, with many plot strands and a great cast of characters. I need to find a way to wind them all up and set them going in the first episode - in Dickens's novel we don't even meet Little Dorrit until around page 70. In fact, Dickens spends his first chapter in a dungeon in Marseille, with Rigaud, a French wife-murderer, and Cavalletto, an Italian smuggler, who have nothing to do with anything yet. How perverse is that? Amy Dorrit is our heroine, the moral centre of the story. I'm sure we need to see her in the first scene of the first episode, emerging through the little door in the great gate of the Marshalsea Prison, where she has lived all her life; and I need the audience to follow her on her journey to the dark, creaky, secret-laden house of Mrs Clennam, where she is to work as a seamstress. I always like to get our heroine in big close-up right at the start of things, to say very clearly that she is the one we're following, she is the one we're investing our hopes in. </p> <p>The hero, Arthur Clennam, is a bit of a Victorian Hamlet-figure. He's been in the Far East for 20 years, and now he's coming back to England to start his life all over again. He senses something rotten in the House of Clennam, and he wants to put things right. He gets nowhere with his implacable mother (Mrs Clennam is one of the scariest mothers in English literature). But he notices the little seamstress working away in the corner of the room, and notices too that Mrs Clennam treats her with more gentleness than he has ever known himself. Perhaps she holds the key to the mystery. Arthur follows Amy home after work, which leads him to the gates of the Marshalsea Prison. And so Arthur Clennam meets the Dorrit family, and at last the story has properly begun. </p> <p>But I can't simply jettison Rigaud and Cavalletto, nor all the other minor characters, Plornish the plasterer, Pancks the rent collector, Casby the slum landlord and his flirty daughter Flora, the terrifying Mr F's Aunt, the Meagleses, the Barnacles, the Chiverys, the Merdles, the Gowans, the Ruggs... The essence of Dickens is in his extravagance, spawning more and more characters and sub-plots in a series of explosions of creativity. I want to keep them all, if I can, while keeping track of the main story, and finding a cliffhanger ending for each 30-minute episode. I'm fond of sudoku puzzles, and this is like a giant one. By the end of the week I have a rough skeleton - a four-line summary for each of the half-hours. Not bad. I'm pleased with myself. </p> <h2>MARCH 2007 </h2> <p><strong>La Trompette restaurant, London W4 </strong></p> <p>I haven't touched Dorrit since January - doing other things while waiting for a producer to come on board. (Back in the old days the producer would have been there before me, initiated the product, and even commissioned it. Now the commissioning comes from on high, and the producer gets assigned to the project.) So here I am on a sunny Friday lunchtime to have an inaugural lunch with my producer, Kate Bartlett, the executive producer, Sally Woodward, and the script editor, Surian Fletcher-Jones, who worked with me on Sense and Sensibility. All women, you might notice. About 10 years ago, Michael Jackson, then heading Channel 4, pointed out that as the audience for drama was predominantly female, surely there should be more women commissioning and producing it. Now there are women in all the big jobs. And that's fine with me. We have a delightful lunch, and tell each other how much we're going to enjoy working together on this wonderful project, etc.</p> <p>The following Monday I'm told that Sally Woodward and Kate Bartlett have both left the BBC, Kate Bartlett to ITV, Sally Woodward to the independent company Carnival. Surely they must have known this on Friday when we were all saying how much fun we were going to have together? Well, it was a very good lunch. And I do like a lunch. </p> <h2>APRIL-OCTOBER 2007 </h2> <p><strong>My flat, London W11 </strong></p> <p>People in the BBC are always dying to get out of their open-plan offices. In the Seventies and Eighties they used to have proper offices, with doors that closed, like cosy dens. A distinguished producer called Kenith Trodd actually lived in his office for over a year - the cleaners refused to go in because it was such a tip. Open-plan offices somehow seem antipathetic to openness, so we have nearly all our script meetings here, or in Kenilworth, where I really live and where the actual writing gets done. And I have a new producer! Her name is Lisa Osborne, who has been head of scripts, and she's red hot on the detail, which is just what we need. She has never produced a show before, and Dorrit is a monster for one's first job, but she seems determined and confident. We get on well from the start. Surian, the script editor, is fast, bright, sunny-tempered (with me, anyway) and beautiful. I'm used to her now - I really would be upset if she shot off to ITV or somewhere. </p> <p>The process: we talk a lot, putting flesh on the skeleton, one episode at a time. We bat outlines back and forth until I feel ready to write the first drafts. This goes on through most of the year. Writing scripts is so different from writing a novel. As soon as I deliver a script, Lisa and Surian are back at me with suggestions. Generally their notes are about keeping the mystery plot going. This is fiendishly complicated, and I'm furious with Dickens for leaving out the links that make it work. I hate writing all these plotty bits - I like the funny bits, the dramatic bits and the moments that bring a lump to your throat, I'm all for the heart and bugger the plot details. I guess Dickens must have been too; but Lisa and Surian are firm: the audience mustn't be cheated. They must have the chance to work it out, and it has to make sense in the end. </p> <h2>OCTOBER 2007-MARCH 2008</h2> <p>It takes all this time to choose directors, assemble a crew and cast the actors. Not my job, but I am keenly engaged. There will have to be three directors for this, their episodes overlapping, if we are going to get the show together for the autumn. The lead director is Dearbhla Walsh, who has worked on The Tudors, then Adam Smith (Skins), and I am pleased that the third is Diarmuid Lawrence, because we go back a very long way - we won the Bafta for Anglo-Saxon Attitudes in 1992. I rarely get the chance to work with the same director twice - don't ask me why. </p> <p>Slowly the cast comes together. Matthew Macfadyen as Arthur. Tom Courtenay. Claire Foy, an absolute beginner, as Amy. I love it when we can have an unknown face in the lead - the audience will accept her as Amy, not see her as a familiar face playing Amy. On the other hand, if the audience don't like her, we're all fucked. I restrain myself from telling Claire this. She probably knows it already. </p> <h2>APRIL 2008</h2> <p>I stay at home, and keep out of everyone's way. To be honest, filming is excruciatingly boring and frustrating when you haven't got a job on the set. They are filming outdoors and the rain pours all week. I wait for the rushes. </p> <p>And the rushes look good. Claire's little face lights up the screen. The funny bits are funny, the dark bits are dark. (Actually it all looks a bit dark but they will fix that in post-production.) </p> <p>I am struggling, as I always do, with the thought that it's not really mine any more. If it ever was. Simon Hoggart once said that what I do with a classic novel is crawl inside it like a hermit crab, make myself at home in it, and then walk off with it. I'm sure he meant it as a hostile criticism but I like the notion - isn't that what we all do when we are reading a favourite book? We make it part of ourselves. It inhabits us, and we inhabit it. No point in fighting it - that's how it has to be. But now it's not just mine. </p> <p>It's Dearbhla's. And Tom's. And Claire's. </p> <p>(Oi, says Dickens. What about me?) </p> <h2>13 SEPTEMBER 2008</h2> <p>It's the wrap party! I have such a good time I lose both my coat and glasses.</p> <h2>OCTOBER 2008 </h2> <p>The first episodes are edited, graded and ready to go out. I feel anxious and protective about it. I want everybody to love it as much as I do. We'll just have to wait and see. Meanwhile the 'real world' has obligingly caught up with our drama. Banks are collapsing, just as Mr Merdle's bank collapses in the book. Will we find ourselves bankrupted like our unfortunate hero? We shall just have to wait and see about that as well. One thing, anyway: we can't say Dickens didn't warn us. </p> <p>\u2022 Little Dorrit starts on BBC1 at the end of this month</p>",
  "<p>Loyalist Billy Wright's 1997 assassination had to be approved by a notorious IRA commander, according to newly released British army intelligence documents.</p> <p>The INLA, which killed Wright inside the Maze prison, sought the consent of the IRA in Belfast before the murder, military intelligence officers have claimed. The group held meetings with the IRA commander, from Ardoyne, north Belfast, who also ordered the 1993 Shankill bomb attack, they said. </p> <p>Undercover army surveillance units had key members of the INLA leadership who were central to the murder plot under round-the-clock observation in the days leading up to Wright's assassination, the documents confirm. </p> <p>The classified material was released last week to the ongoing public inquiry into the killing of the Loyalist Volunteer Force leader in the maximum-security prison. </p> <p>Wright's family have alleged that the prison authorities and the security forces 'turned a blind eye' to the dangers the LVF founder faced while sharing a block with INLA inmates. They also claim the security forces could have prevented the murder because they had intelligence warnings that he was being targeted. </p> <p>A military intelligence officer known as Captain AA told the inquiry that the meetings, under constant surveillance, could have related to Wright's murder. He said that he was a battalion intelligence officer with responsibility for north and west Belfast from September 1997 to May 1998. </p> <p>Under questioning last week by the Rev John Oliver, the former Anglican Bishop of Hereford who is one of three inquiry panel members, Captain AA said that the INLA had to seek the approval of the IRA to kill Wright. Captain AA said: 'It would have been foolhardy of them [INLA] to carry out an operation without at least the tacit consent of PIRA.'</p> <p>A further British military assessment disclosed to the tribunal states: 'It is assessed the INLA meetings held at Belfast address 1 on the 16th and 19th of December were in connection with the murder of Billy Wright.'</p> <p>Wright's murder almost destroyed the fragile political negotiations leading to the Good Friday Agreement a few months later. Wright's killing caused a wave of loyalist retaliatory gun attacks in Belfast and mid-Ulster.</p>",
  "<p>New figures showing a rise in the number of domestic cats contracting bovine tuberculosis have prompted claims the disease is out of control.</p> <p>Details released by the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs show that 42 cats were confirmed with bovine TB between 2005 and 2007 compared with 15 over the previous seven years. The National Farmers' Union said it was a 'worrying trend' indicating the relentless rise in infection in cattle and badgers. 'It's just the tip of the iceberg,' said Catherine McLaughlin, the union's animal health and welfare adviser. 'Given that these cases were only identified through post mortems or clinical intervention, it suggests far greater levels of transmission than we have previously seen.'</p> <p>The Badger Trust dismissed the claims as 'scaremongering', while Defra attributed the rise to increased reporting since TB in cats became a notifiable disease 18 months ago. The Defra figures, released to the NFU under the Freedom of Information Act, show that the M. bovis strain was also found in 21 pigs and farmed wild boar, 25 llamas, five alpacas, three ferrets, two sheep, two goats and one dog during the same period. McLaughlin said it was not known if the domestic animals were infected through cattle or badgers, but the fact that infected cattle were immediately slaughtered and therefore 'less infectious' meant the culprit was 'more likely' to be badgers. 'The last thing we want to do is cause panic, but this needs to be taken seriously. And at the moment it is being treated irresponsibly by the government.'</p> <p>Environment Secretary Hilary Benn has ruled out a badger cull in England, in case patchy culling makes the spread of the disease worse. A government response to the Defra committee inquiry into badger culling published last week also acknowledged the likelihood of 'public order problems' jeopardising any cull.</p> <p>Defra figures confirm a 26 per cent rise in bTB in cattle in England this year, with 20,055 animals slaughtered between January and June.</p>",
  "<p>Tamsin Omond doesn't live like the granddaughter of a baronet, a candidate for priesthood or a first-class honours graduate from Cambridge who will be sitting her Open University MA examination tomorrow. Despite a flat crammed with political treatises and teetering heaps of campaign banners, high-visibility protest jackets and demonstration handouts, Omond is all three.</p> <p>In a few hours' time, however, the dissonance between Omond's lineage and her surroundings could be even greater. Tomorrow, she could exchange her chaotic but comfortable north London flat for a single room provided at Her Majesty's pleasure, via an examination hall and a high-profile Westminster demonstration attended by the likes of Baroness Tonge and Rosie Boycott.</p> <p>'I don't want to go to jail. I don't want to break the law,' said 23-year-old Omond. 'The idea of going to prison makes me sick and nervous. It's very definitely not part of my life plan and I absolutely don't want it to happen. But if that's the price of protest, I find myself in a very difficult position.'</p> <p>Omond is the founder of Climate Rush, the group behind tomorrow's demonstration in Parliament Square that will call for an end to airport expansion and tougher measures to control carbon dioxide emissions. It is a case in which she passionately believes: last February she was one of the so-called 'Commons Five' whose faces flashed across news programmes throughout the world when they scaled the Houses of Parliament to protest against a third runway at Heathrow.</p> <p>The group stayed on the roof for three hours: a period carefully timed to coincide with Gordon Brown's arrival for Prime Minister's questions, during which at least one MP was to ask questions about the anti-aviation debate. Brown cancelled at the last minute - Omond is not sure whether his non-appearance was linked to the protest - and the group descended from the rooftops to be met by police who arrested them on charges of trespass. The group were kept in custody for 12 hours before being released on bail to await their trial on 11 November, at which they could receive a maximum penalty of 51 weeks' custody and a \u00a35,000 fine.</p> <p>But if the idea of a year's incarceration makes her feel queasy, it is the bail conditions that are causing her immediate concern. 'If I go into the Houses of Parliament or break the law before the court case, I will be held on remand,' she admitted. 'Part of me doesn't want this life at all. But if you look back at history, the world has been changed by people with the courage to fight for the right thing at a time when that thing was being completely ignored. This is exactly the position we're in now.</p> <p>'What I find most shattering is this amazing discrepancy between what is scientifically proven and what the public are being told,' she added. 'Time is fast running out to stop irreversible climate change. Global warming experts agree that we have only 100 months to avoid disaster, and yet we're in this ridiculous situation where the public are saying climate change can't be that bad, otherwise the government would do something. And the government is saying it is that bad, but we can't do something because the public's not ready for it.'</p> <p>It was this Alice in Wonderland world that, five years ago, shunted Omond on to the path she is now hurtling down. 'I was in my final year at Cambridge and had my life planned out: I was going to go into marketing and get a nice job in the City. Then one day, instead of reading King Lear for the eighth time, I picked up some climate change research and found I couldn't put it down.'</p> <p>In the year after graduating from Cambridge with a first-class honours degree in English, Omond continued her environmental research. 'I became completely convinced by the evidence that we only have a really limited time to make a large social change,' she said. 'I realised that direct action was the only way to raise public consciousness to a point where those changes could be made.'</p> <p>Omond had never attended a protest but she took to grassroots campaigning like a duck to water; helping co-ordinate carnival marches, protest camps, lock-on's (attaching herself to buildings and gates with locks) and banner-drops. In December 2007, she became London co-ordinator for the environmental network Plane Stupid, organising protests at corporate offices, high-street travel agents and local airports.</p> <p>Last July, she was one of the group who blasted aircraft noise through the letterbox of the then Transport Secretary Ruth Kelly's Docklands apartment at 7.30am - leaving peacefully, albeit pursued by Kelly's husband, Derek Gadd.</p> <p>Shortly after Omond left Cambridge, she had decided she wanted to become a priest. Already a church administrator, she asked her vicar to initiate conversations with the local bishop about beginning her training. It is, she now admits, a dream she might never realise.</p> <p>'I would love to return to training for the priesthood, but this whole period of me breaking the law might mean that they don't want me any more,' she said. 'I desperately want to be a priest, but I don't have the time to commit myself to the Church and to activism at the same time. I had to pick one and, at the moment, my environmental action is more important.'</p> <p>Tomorrow afternoon, Omond will gather together her banners, handouts, high-visibility jackets - and her revision notes - and head off to sit her MA. It is a three-hour examination but she has to finish it in two hours if she is to reach Parliament Square by 5.30pm and catch the impressive list of speakers who support the cause: Rosie Boycott will be followed by, among others, Sam Roddick and Baroness Tonge.</p> <p>The line-up concludes at 6.30pm with a speech from Omond herself. And then there will be an hour left to protest in the best way the group know.</p>",

  "<p>The travails of Sarah Palin may be making all the headlines in the race for the White House this weekend. But a scandal in Alaska, however embarrassing for the McCain/Palin campaign, is likely to be of only passing interest in Canton, Ohio. Here it has always been about the economy. </p> <p>Ingrid Roth has the quintessential American job in the quintessential American state. She is a travelling saleswoman in Ohio. But the economic crisis gripping the US has had a devastating impact. Roth has postponed a planned mortgage refinancing and high petrol prices have hit the amount she is able to spend. 'Today it's a choice between putting food on the table or gas in my car,' she said bluntly.</p> <p>Like many working Americans, Roth views the economic future with doubt. But her political opinions are now certain. Roth had just visited the Barack Obama campaign headquarters in her home town of Canton and picked up a huge Obama placard. She was carrying it through the street to her car. Her motivation for backing Obama was simple. 'Financial reasons,' she said. 'It is just seriously all about the economy.'</p> <p>Canton lies in the heart of America's Rust Belt. It was a region once reliant on large-scale manufacturing but now it is dotted with empty factories as jobs and plants have disappeared overseas. Recently Forbes magazine produced a top 10 list of America's fastest dying cities. Four of them were in Ohio. Three of those - Canton, Akron and Cleveland - are in the state's Rust Belt. </p> <p>But until recently this was an area that was also sceptical of Obama. Its large white working-class population mostly backed Hillary Clinton and helped her fight Obama to the bitter end in the Democrats' long nomination battle. Obama's lack of populist appeal, his unusual and exotic background, and his academic style of oratory failed to inspire many parts of Ohio. That also kept the state in contention for Republican John McCain for many long months. </p> <p>Over the summer McCain often led in the polls in Ohio. But things are changing. As stock markets have fallen and banks collapsed, Obama's popularity has surged across the battleground states, especially among once sceptical whites. 'It is not Obama sealing the deal with these voters. It is the situation sealing the deal for him,' said Professor Stephen Brooks, a political scientist at the University of Akron.</p> <p>McCain has even abandoned his long-standing target of Michigan. Now the battle is being waged in once safely Republican red states such as Indiana, North Carolina and Virginia. Ohio, too, has followed suit. Obama leads there by an average of three points. It is a narrow but solid lead in a state that has voted for the winning candidate in every election since 1960. If Obama wins in Ohio in four weeks' time, he will almost certainly win the White House too. He will have people such as Roth and cities such as Canton to thank for becoming the country's first black president. 'Hillary was my first choice, but I'm not voting for McCain. No chance,' Roth said. Then she put her new Obama sign in her car and drove away. By nightfall she planned to put it up in her front yard.</p> <p>A short drive from Canton is the city of Akron. The two towns are so close they share much, including an airport. They also share a devastated economy, hard-hit downtowns and a place on Forbes' grim list. Akron's plight has even inspired a song by its most famous native daughter, the Pretenders' lead singer Chrissie Hynde. In 'My City Was Gone' Hynde sang about the city's decline. 'I went back to Ohio/But my city was gone/There was no train station, there was no downtown,' Hynde lamented. Hynde had a point. Like many other cities in Ohio's Rust Belt, Akron's downtown is a shadow of its former self. Grand buildings from its heyday of the Twenties and Thirties stand next to empty lots. Many streets are lined with boarded-up shopfronts. Few people live there, having long fled to the suburbs or to different towns. Akron's population has dropped dramatically. In 1960 the city boasted almost 300,000 people. Since then it has lost a third of its population.</p> <p>Yet a picture of relentless decline is far too simple. Large efforts have been put into rejuvenating the city, and especially downtown. Ironically Hynde herself is playing a key role. She has opened a plush vegan restaurant in a new downtown loft development and snapped up one of the apartments above it. </p> <p>Called VegiTerranean, it is a swanky place of chrome fittings and black-clad waiting staff that would not look out of place in Manhattan. It is a far cry from the usual image of ailing Akron. Here, too, Obama's support is solid. In Ohio both working-class whites and traditional liberals have now swung their support to Obama. 'He's thoughtful. He's intelligent,' said local writer Lisa DeBenedictis, as she left VegiTerranean after having lunch with her young son. 'I can't vote for McCain. I have a 10-year-old son and I don't want him to be drafted some day into another war,' she said.</p> <p>Obama's long-term plan to create a winning coalition is coming to fruition, fuelled by the economic crisis as much as the campaign's own actions. It is based on getting traditional liberals on board with white working-class Democrats and generating a huge boost in turnout with black Americans and young people. Obama's campaign has bet that such an alliance should be enough to beat a Republican party saddled with a historically unpopular President in the shape of George Bush. To that end, the Obama camp and its allies have embarked on a highly organised registration drive, much of which has been aimed at getting people to vote early. The effort has generated much controversy, including accusations of false registrations, but it has ploughed on regardless. </p> <p>A representative of its success is someone like Jermaine Brooks. He was proudly wearing his 'I Voted' badge on his jacket in downtown Akron after already casting an early vote for Obama. 'I ain't voting for McCain. He's just more Bush,' he said. Brooks is struggling in the economic downtown, hopping from one low-paid job to another. 'Right now, I am bouncing around minimum-wage jobs. Like Burger King,' he said. </p> <p>Brooks, who is black, needed a morale boost and he found that in voting for Obama. He said he was proud to cast his first vote for a fellow black American. 'That was my first thought. I felt that I was really part of something,' he said. </p> <p>Such emotions are likely to be repeated in their millions on election day. If black turnout is high enough, the final piece in the Obama camp's jigsaw will fit into place. It is not over yet. Not even in Ohio. This is political turf being ferociously fought over. 'The economic situation has boosted Obama. But situations can change,' said Professor Brooks. </p> <p>If polling holds up in the same position as it is now, no one will be talking about a narrow Obama win. He will take Ohio, Florida, Pennsylvania and perhaps even some states in the Old South, like Virginia or North Carolina, that have long seemed out of reach for modern Democrats. It could end up being a landslide.</p> <p>\u2022 Chrissie Hynde of the Pretenders has opened her restaurant <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2008/oct/11/1\">VegiTerranean </a> in her home town of Akron</p>",

  "<p>The G7 club of rich nations was this weekend facing up to a seismic shift in the global economy, as the International Monetary Fund predicted that emerging markets would soon be sitting on $6.5 trillion of foreign currency reserves.</p> <p>After Wall Street suffered its worst ever week, and more than a fifth was wiped off the value of companies in all the major European markets in just five days, finance ministers and central bankers gathered in Washington for the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund were painfully aware of their diminished power.</p> <p>Iceland, where a banking crisis is threatening the solvency of the government, turned first to Russia for a $4bn loan, instead of calling on the IMF. Moscow has said there are no strings attached to the funds, but many analysts see Russia as trying to extend its geopolitical power.</p> <p>Graham Turner, of GFC Economics, said it would not be surprising to see China, too, bailing out governments in the months ahead. 'It's the perfect opportunity for them to demonstrate their hegemony,' he said. The IMF believes that up to 30 countries are at severe risk of facing a government budget crisis because of the combination of the credit crunch and volatile commodity prices.</p> <p>IMF managing director Dominique Strauss-Kahn has said he has a $200bn war chest to make loans to struggling governments, but the lender's resources are dwarfed by the cash piles held by governments in China, Russia and the Middle East. Battered banks in G7 countries and governments hit by debt crises may have little choice but to appeal to these new powerbrokers in the coming years. </p> <p>In its half-yearly health check of the global economy, the IMF predicted that the reserves held by China, Russia and other emerging markets would surge from $4.7 trillion last year to $6.5 trillion by the end of 2009. It also emerged this weekend that the Treasury hopes rapidly to offload the stakes it is buying in Britain's banks, once calm is restored; and is likely to look to cash-rich sovereign wealth funds as potential investors.</p> <p>Turner added that the very reason many of these countries have accumulated huge surpluses was to avoid having to go cap in hand to the IMF as they did during the Asian financial crisis a decade ago, and accept stringent policy conditions in exchange.

  "<p>Retail billionaire Sir Philip Green is poised to cement his position as king of the high street after staging a dramatic intervention to stave off the collapse of Icelandic retail investor Baugur.</p> <p>Baugur's empire was understood to be on the brink of administration after Iceland's three largest banks, Kaupthing, Landsbanki and Glitnir, were taken into state hands. As a result many of Baugur's accounts were frozen; in turn, the banks were hawking the equity stakes they held to potential buyers in the Square Mile.</p> <p>Advisers KPMG have had staff in Reykjavik and London desperately trying to come up with a solution to Baugur's position. Green could potentially control parts of Baugur's holdings in House of Fraser, as well as Mosaic Fashions, owner of the Karen Millen, Oasis and Warehouse chains.</p> <p>Baugur employs 53,000 people and head office staff were said to be concerned about their future on Friday.</p> <p>Green could invest up to \u00a32bn into Baugur. It is thought he is prepared to buy up the retailers' debt held by the Icelandic banks. This would put him in a position to exert control over the teetering retail group. Kaupthing has stakes in Mosaic and Jane Norman while Glitnir has holdings in House of Fraser, Whistles and jewellery group Aurum, which owns Goldsmiths and Mappin &amp; Webb.</p> <p>If Green pulls off the eleventh hour intervention it would reunite him with his former Topshop brand director Jane Shepherdson, who quit two years ago amid acrimony and now runs Whistles, which is co-owned by Baugur.</p> <p>This weekend Green flew to Iceland to hold talks with Baugur executive chairman Jon Asgeir Johannesson and chief executive Gunnar Sigurdsson.</p> <p>Green faces competition for the debt as a major British bank is also in talks to buy Kaupthing's UK loan book. 'All roads lead back to Kaupthing,' said one senior industry banker. 'A number of discussions are taking place in respect to shareholders and the way in which capital might be organised going forward.'</p> <p>Amid the effective meltdown of the Icelandic economy, Sigurdsson has tried to present a public veneer of calm, insisting it was business as usual.

  "<p>Did the London bombings of 7/7 register any kind of cultural fallout, or were the explosions swallowed up by the cacophony that is pop today? This is often the sort of question that can attend to listening to a new Nitin Sawhney album - and before anyone can mutter 'surely Bloc Party must have recorded something along those lines', let's be quite clear: 'Days of Fire', the first track on London Undersound, is certainly the most thoughtful and affecting response to the horrors of that day yet committed to CD.</p> <p>It sees the young MC Natty, one of several guest vocalists here, giving an account of his experiences of the attacks and also of that day two weeks later which saw the shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes (Natty was on the next tube due into Stockwell station). Rather than agit-prop, the approach is personal; set against Sawhney's acoustic guitar is the refrain 'it all went slow motion ... now we're all in slow motion', and as well as freezing the action and pain, the blurring of confusion is felt, too. </p> <p>London Undersound as a whole is intended as a response to 7/7 - for Sawhney it's a 'collection of thoughts, ideas, feelings and catharsis in a city of immense diversity, imagination and beliefs'. The rest of the record is nothing like as explicit - several tracks don't feature vocals - but there is a political point being made in the range of collaborators present: the Spanish outfit Ojos de Brujo, sitarist Anoushka Shankar, Qui Zenghui, a moon lute player, and singers of varying fame including Tina Grace, Imogen Heap, Rheena Bhardwaj and - giving it less two thumbs aloft and more an impression of his thoughts on civil surveillance - Paul McCartney.</p> <p>Sawhney himself has always been adept in several genres - as a child he studied piano, classical and flamenco guitar, sitar and tabla, and you can hear the equally formative influence of Massive Attack on the track 'Last Train to Midnight' and of drum'n'bass elsewhere. It's a good time for the multifaceted musician who continues to mix up writing film scores (for the 1929 silent classic A Throw of Dice, for instance) with club DJing duties. Last month, presumably sharing track side with a gaggle of pneumatic pit girls, he carried out two 'Sound System performances' at the Formula 1 night race in Singapore. Later this month, he plays one of the BBC's Electric Proms at the Roundhouse. Quietly, this restless figure has become established as one of our most interesting and significant artists, but if that makes him sound terribly po-faced, he's not. (And his CV does include the role he had, with Sanjeev Bhaskar, in conceiving the TV show Goodness Gracious Me.</p> <p>None the less, no one could pretend that this eighth album is a barrel of laughs. It comes packaged with a series of drawings conceived to complement each track by the artist Antony Gormley and these reflect the sombre tone. The McCartney track does serve up optimism - 'When all the world is asleep, we could set ourselves free,' he sings - but even then there's the dark shadow of the question: 'How could they steel all these feelings?' Once you've got past the distraction of it actually being McCartney at the mic, you realise that he delivers a terrific vocal, but it's the weakest piece of songwriting on the album. Better the closing instrumental pieces 'Firmament' and 'Charu Keshi Rain', which address the ostensible subject matter of the record through the deft subtleties of the playing.</p> <p>'London has become polarised in a way that I find uncomfortable and threatening,' Sawhney has also said. Compared to other recent albums that address the capital, such as the Bug's London Zoo and even Dusk + Blackdown's Margins Music, this is a record that goes about its business quietly. The chatter of modern culture might make such a response to 7/7 unfashionable, but such a thoughtful voice, and so deeply felt a record, shouldn't go unheeded.</p> <p><strong>Download</strong> 'Days of Fire'; 'My Soul'; 'Shadowland'</p>",
  "<p>Having left his home in Portland, Oregon last year to join the massed ranks of pop experimentalists Efterklang in Denmark, 21-year-old classically trained multi-instrumentalist Peter Broderick has headed even further out into the wide open spaces. With just his clear voice, a guitar, and a few unobtrusive daubs of instrumental colour in the background, on Home Broderick creates a gently hypnotising chain of music that holds together beautifully. There's a bit of Jos\u00e9 Gonz\u00e1lez in here (especially on 'With the Notes in My Ears', though Broderick is less brittle), as well as a pinch of Bon Iver and a smattering of John Taverner, but the drifting melancholy at the album's heart ('When I'm home, I'm not at home') belongs to Broderick alone.</p> <p>The mood is accentuated by the layered vocals, creeping into otherwise sparse songs like a sea mist sweeping over the shoreline: opener 'Games' is a wordless choral chant, and on much of the rest of the album the vocals travel somewhere beyond the reach of identifiable language. When the music turns genuinely unsettling, as on the haunting 'Sickness, Bury', you realise that Broderick will one day write seriously great film scores. For now, the pictures can be of anything you like.</p> <p>This is a quietly superb album that places a high price on beauty and yet never fails to pay up. </p> <p><strong>Download</strong>'Not at Home'; 'With the Notes in My Ears'</p>",
  "<p>When they are on stage Amadou and Mariam never leave each other's side; they stand as close as they can to each other, to the extent that their extraordinary music seems to come from a single shared place. They do something like the same thing on their sofa in the front room of their bare-walled Parisian flat; Mariam constantly checking her husband's proximity as they talk, he reassuring her with his touch. Their relationship is among the longest running love songs ever written. </p> <p>Amadou Bagayoko and Mariam Doumbia first heard each other making music at the Institute for the Blind in Bamako, the capital of Mali, back in 1976. They have never stopped listening. Mariam was the student with the mesmerising voice, mournful and effervescent by turns - she had been performing at weddings and funerals since she was 10. Amadou was her young music teacher, a finger-picking genius on the guitar, member of Mali's most famous band, Les Ambassadeurs. Neither of them had been born blind and, having lost their sight - she aged five, he aged 15 - they had not imagined subsequently falling in love with anything but their music. As they sit on their sofa and explain how this proved not to be the case, how what happened between them was their very particular version of 'love at first sight' they cannot stop smiling, as if, three decades on, they still can't believe their luck.</p> <p>If you have been fortunate enough to hear Amadou and Mariam's last album, Dimanche a Bamako, which came out a couple of years ago, you would understand exactly this sense of providential joy. It is the emotion that carries a good deal of their music, and one that in early 2005 brought a sudden sense of the lazy Sunday afternoons of a Malian summer into a Parisian winter - the album sold more than half a million copies in France alone. Produced by the midas-touch Manu Chao it also walked off with the prestigious French Victoire de la Musique award and was Album of the Year and Best African Album in the Radio 3 Awards for World Music. So, with a new album out next month, the equally life-affirming but increasingly ambitious Welcome to Mali, we talk first about the obvious thing, how hard an act has that breakthrough album been to follow?</p> <p>It wasn't so hard, they suggest, in their native French; 'having waited a long time for it, success is the easiest thing in the world,' the 54-year-old Amadou says, laughing behind big silver-framed shades. There is no pressure except the usual pressure to come up with new melodies, new sounds. 'The feeling of that album was still very strong, and we had some good songs and good people to work with, so it was simple enough.' One of those collaborators was Damon Albarn, who has produced the opening track on Welcome To Mali, the hypnotic 'Sabali', which sounds like nothing you have ever heard - ethereal Malian wonder meets savvy Britpop keyboards. Albarn exploits the 50-year-old Mariam's voice to great effect - she has the ability to give even the catchiest pop tune a hint of otherworldy sadness. On 'Sabali' she sings breathily of hard-won wisdom - and it comes as no great surprise to learn that the wisdom in question is the sense that 'avec toi, cherie, la vie est belle.'</p> <p>Albarn had been 'brilliantly curious' to work with, Amadou - who does nearly all of the talking - says, in the sense that he 'was always trying to find something new from us'. Albarn had seen them play at a music festival in Timbuktu, and they later met in Brixton, where Amadou and Mariam became involved with African Express, the roving musical party that aims to bring the best African bands in contact with new audiences - in part a response to Bob Geldof's strange notion at Live 8 that a concert for Africa should not necessarily include any African musicians because a global audience would find it hard to relate to them.</p> <p>Amadou and Mariam are living proof of the absurdity of that idea. They resist the label 'world music' to describe what they do, preferring to call it 'music from and for the world'. The more you listen to Welcome to Mali, the more you hear the force of that idea - there are little refrains from everywhere you have ever been wrapped up in it. Amadou puts this down to his obsessive radio habit. Wherever he is on tour he will have a radio clamped to his ear, scanning for whatever is local and new. This habit began for him in the Sixties and Seventies when he was perhaps the only Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd fan in Bamako. While his friends were listening to Guinean dance music, or Cuban imports, he was adding Eric Clapton and Jimmy Page riffs to his traditional Malian technique. Two of his uncles, he says, were professional guitar players, one in a band, the other playing 'music for hunters', but neither of them sounded a bit like him.</p> <p>It was this distinctive electric sound that gave a young music producer called Marc-Antoine Moreau pause when he first heard Amadou and Mariam in 1990. Moreau, the couple's long-term manager and producer, explains what sounds very much like the workings of fate. He was on a tour of west Africa in search of bands and one afternoon on a whim he took a train from Dakar to Abidjan. Having bought a few CDs at random in a record shop he was listening to Amadou and Mariam at a bus stop. A woman came up to him and said, 'That record is by my sister'. Yes, Moreau thought at first, in Africa we are all brothers and sisters. But no, she insisted, it was actually her sister. Moreau told her who he was and to pass on his regards, but though he kept the music in his head, he did not follow up the contact. In 1994 he heard that Amadou and Mariam were playing at a small gig in Paris. He went along and when he introdced himself after the show he was greeted, in a Stanley and Livingstone kind of moment, with the words: 'Ah, you are the guy from the bus stop.' 'Amadou is like that,' Moreau says, 'he is a magical kind of guy. Things happen to him.'</p> <p>In Amadou's own telling it was only a matter of time before someone like Moreau had come along to recognise their music. 'If you have optimism and courage, then you can make your own destiny,' he says; the harder they worked at their music the luckier they got. 'The big difference with them and any other artist we know from Mali, the great Salif Keita, for example,' says Moreau, 'is that they are genuine pop artists, they create pop songs naturally.' While Amadou was listening to Pink Floyd on his radio in the Seventies, Mariam had a compulsive affection for French pop tunes. 'The result, added to their traditional Malian musical background could sound like African electric blues,' Moreau suggests, 'but it is not that at all.' This resistance to definition is reflected in their audience. Though they sing in French when they play in America they have black mamas getting down and hearing Africa, and white Texan rednecks dancing alongside them hearing rock and roll. In England, at the O2 last summer, the duo supported pan-sexual disco sensations the Scissor Sisters.</p> <p>The sound, nearly always upbeat, carries somewhere in it all of the struggle that Amadou and Mariam have had to get here. These days in the Malian suburb of Paris where they have a flat, Montreuil (known as Mali's second city), and beyond, they can't walk down the street without being mobbed, but when they first came to the French capital at Moreau's suggestion in 1996 to make a studio album they could not get visas, had to play cat and mouse with the immigration authorities in order to get the record made.</p> <p>That kind of battle, and the stubborn good humour required to overcome it was nothing new though. And it was nothing at all compared with the difficulties they had as a blind couple with three young children in Bamako trying to get a music career off the ground. Their relationship itself had initially met with resistance from some parts of their families who thought that two blind people together could never work. Having achieved some local success with a group from the blind institute in Bamako, Amadou and Mariam decided to prove the doubters wrong by going to the Ivory Coast, to make a name for themselves.</p> <p>It did not work out exactly as they had hoped. They were billed for a couple of years, reductively, as 'The Blind Couple from Mali' and were in danger of being a novelty act. 'It was complicated,' Amadou recalls. 'We were certainly from Mali and we were certainly blind, and you should remember that being blind in Africa is not quite as unusual as being blind in the West, there is less stigma. But even so, we did not think that was all we were about.'</p> <p>Did they draw strength as a couple from their determination to overcome that billing?</p> <p>Amadou thinks for a moment. 'The music itself gave us the strength to overcome the blindness, so you cannot separate the two,' he says. 'We were musicians first, blind second,' Mariam suggests.</p> <p>I wonder if they look at their lives as a before and after - do they think of the time when they could see as a different kind of life?</p> <p>Mariam does to a degree, Amadou is less sure. 'I used to be able to see, then I could see less, finally I could see not at all,' he says. 'It did not seem a different life. And when I did become blind, there were plenty of examples of blind musicians I could find inspiration from. Ray Charles, Stevie Wonder, I listened hard to what they had done.'</p> <p>The portrait they present of their homeland in songs sounds like a remembered paradise, where Sundays are for weddings, and every day is a carnival ('I'll be the most beautiful, the prettiest girl there for you, my love, at the village fete!' they sing on 'La fete au village'). They now live six months of the year in Paris - partly with their son, Sam, who has a recording deal with his own group, SMOD (and whose debut album, also produced by Manu Chao, will appear next year) - but Bamako is still home. When they are there they work as much as they can with the Blind Institute, hosting a fund raising concert each year at which some of Africa's biggest names perform, in order to keep things running.</p> <p>When they go back these days, though, it is with a sense of some of their dreams fulfilled. There have been many magical nights; a few stand out in their memory. There was the time at the Trance festival in Rennes, when they had just started out in France and no one really knew them but with their first song the whole place came alive. And in Rio more recently, when they played in the round at the Maracana Stadium and as they took the stage a Mexican wave rippled through the crowd. Amadou and Mariam could only stand in the middle together, holding each other, and wonder what this strange turbulent motion of sound was. And then there was Glastonbury last year: 'I had thought mud like that only existed in Mali during the rains,' Amadou says, 'but it was home away from home.'</p> <p>In all of this Amadou and Mariam are in danger of giving musical marriages - notoriously volatile - a good name. A highlight of their shows is their distinctively Malian version of 'Je t'aime', which is rendered as 'M'Bife'. Unlike Serge Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, however, still Paris's other favourite couple, they have stayed together. </p> <p>I wonder about the secret of this love story. 'I am interested in what interests her,' Amadou says, 'and she is interested in what interests me, and we talk about it every day.' Sitting there on the sofa, in this unadorned apartment a very long way from where they set out, Mariam agrees, moves closer to her husband, hanging on his words, occasionally reaching to stroke the back of his neck. Otherwise, they suggest, the secret of their happiness is all about timetabling. Amadou is an early riser, he writes his songs - intricate in structure - as the sun is coming up. Mariam is a night owl, she does her writing - songs from the heart - before bed. They meet in the middle of the day to compare notes, sometimes they disagree ('of course, we have a different vision of things occasionally') but eventually, invariably, they still make beautiful music.</p> <h2>Damon Albarn on the 'Geezer' Amadou</h2> <p> 'I love these people. I first met Amadou and Mariam years ago, though I can't actually remember when. They are a classic rock and roll, soul duo. You won't find anything more authentic, genuine or ecstatic this side of Bamako. Miriam's voice makes me go all funny and Amadou is a fucking geezer.'</p> <p>\u2022 'Sabali' (Because Music) is released on October 27 with Welcome To Mali to follow on November 17. Amadou and Mariam will appear at a new Africa Express gig at Koko, London NW1 on October 22.</p>",
  "<p><strong>The dilemma:</strong> I am 50 years of age, residing in India, and have been married for the past 25 years. The marriage was a love marriage, but my wife has been a bully for all these years. It took me time to realise this fact, as I used to think that only men are bullies. Ultimately we two are together, but with little love between us. I have an eight-year-old son and a 24-year-old daughter. Now I have fallen in love with my wife's sister, who lives in the UK and is divorced. She has been single for the past 10 years. Despite my frequent letters on the internet to her, she does not reply or oppose my subtle love letters. There is complete silence from her side, though she reads all my letters. This has been going on for a year now. I want to have a serious relationship with her. Is she interested? This is something I cannot fathom. What should I do?</p> <p><strong>Mariella:</strong> Normally I try to avoid letters from the potentially insane, but just this once I'm going to make an exception. Let's make the most of my generous mood. I'm delighted that you enjoy the column despite being half a world away, and there's certainly something rather compelling about your naivet\u00e9. As to your wife's behaviour, I don't condone it, but I'm afraid I can also understand why she might bully you around a bit. WHAT ARE YOU THINKING? You really haven't given this much consideration, have you? Even in our morally casual society, running off with your sister-in-law is a clear no-no. India may be becoming increasingly westernised, but even so, your behaviour would already be considered a major transgression. Were you to take it further, I imagine you would bring nothing but shame on yourself and your wife and embarrassment on your children. It beggars belief that on such a vast continent you can't find one other woman you could strike up a relationship with. Have you just fixed your myopic eye on the closest apparently available female? You certainly don't get much closer than your spouse's sister, nor could you seek out more turbulent emotional water.</p> <p>It actually makes me a little suspicious of your motives, and of your true commitment to your in-law. She must be a pretty amazing woman if the fact that she's family, lives thousands of miles away and never replies to your love letters hasn't dissuaded you from pursuing her. Could it be that both the distance and an assumption of her availability are what's got you all worked up in the first place? Just because your sister-in-law has been divorced for 10 years doesn't mean she's alone, or waiting for your missives - she may already have filled the partner vacancy in her life and chosen to keep it to herself. You say you are sure she reads your emails, but I'm not sure how you can be so confident about that. The 'delete' button is usually next to 'reply', and she's definitely not pressing the latter. Thankfully one of you is displaying good sense. The bad news is it's not you. </p> <p>I think I need to spell it out. She is completely ignoring you. In the real world that tends to suggest a lack of interest. Instead, you've decided to interpret her lack of response as a tacit acceptance of your advances. Has it occurred to you at all that she has been shocked into silence by the audacity of your behaviour? You're lucky she hasn't told her sister. But I'll bet that if you carry on, it's your wife, not you, who's most likely to get a note. You're obviously hurt and angry by your wife's treatment of you over the years, and I'm sure you have justification. In the circumstances it's natural to gravitate toward a course of action that superficially seems to offer you an opportunity for revenge. It's never that simple. </p> <p>You have three issues to sort out. The first and most imperative is the state of your marriage. With an eight-year-old child still to raise, it would be a shame to split up, but if you are unhappy perhaps that is the best course of action. Only when you have had a full and frank discussion with your wife and chosen your path should you even begin to consider another relationship. When it comes to where you go next, may I suggest a brief interlude alone as a sort of staging post on your journey? I'm hoping that with the benefit of cooled emotions and a sliver of pragmatism you'll actually see sense and realise that the best way to move on in your life is not to settle down with your sister-in-law. Especially since, as I've already pointed out, that doesn't seem to be an option. For your own sake, forget this unrequited passion and instead cast a mature eye on your life. With a bit less fantasising and a more realistic approach, you have a good chance of improving the quality of your existence. If, on the other hand, you continue with this one-sided love affair, you have everything to lose, including those around you who you really do care about.</p> <p>I'm sorry to be so brutal, but I see a person here in danger of losing everything before he's even worked out what he wants. You're a man, not a schoolboy - start behaving like one.</p> <p>If you, too, have a dilemma, send a brief email to <a href=\"mailto:mariella.frostrup@observer.co.uk\">mariella.frostrup@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>It was at Andy Anderson's print shop that I first encountered the young lawyer-revolutionary Nelson Mandela. He was not a frequent shebeener or drinker, but 40 years later, when he was president and I was his biographer, he would often introduce me to others - including Prince Charles - by saying: 'I first met Tony in a shebeen.' The encounter should have been imprinted on my mind, but my memory was shaky, I was probably quite drunk, and he recalled it better than I.</p> <p>Soon afterwards I saw Mandela on a much more memorable occasion when I watched him launch the Defiance Campaign, of which he was chief volunteer. On 26 June 1952 I drove out to Boksburg, a grim mining town outside Johannesburg, to watch him assembling the first batch of 52 'defiers', including Indians as well as Africans, who gathered outside the township and then walked through the gates with quiet dignity, to be arrested by the police for illegally entering - while Mandela stood by calmly.</p> <p>It was the beginning of the open resistance to apartheid which would culminate in Mandela's imprisonment 10 years later, but it was a low-key event, designed to offer no provocation, and few people recognised its significance. Two months later I commissioned Mandela to write a short article in the Johannesburg-based magazine I was editing called Drum, entitled 'We defy' - his first major contribution - which spelt out his commitment: 'Though it takes us years,' he wrote, 'we are prepared to continue the campaign until the six unjust laws we have chosen for the present phase are done away with.' After some copies had been printed we had to scrap the article because it became illegal after Mandela and others had been arrested.</p> <p>I would love to recollect that I recognised Mandela from the start as a true leader of his people, destined to change the course of history. But in truth at that time I sadly underestimated him: he seemed to me too flashy and vain, with his immaculate suits and his wide smile, and he kept aloof from most white observers; I found his rhetoric too formal and stilted, full of anti-colonialist clich\u00e9s. I was much more impressed by his mentor, Walter Sisulu, and by his legal partner, the intellectual Oliver Tambo. It was not until 1964, when he made his first great speech in court before going to jail, that I realised his true courage and total commitment.</p> <p>I left Johannesburg in 1955, returning to England, and took up a post at The Observer. I occasionally returned to South Africa, most memorably at the end of Nelson Mandela's long second trial, when he and his colleagues were charged with conspiring to overthrow the state. The atmosphere was bleak after two years of oppression. The police were more professional and ruthless, with the help of detentions, torture and more systematic intelligence which they had learnt in Israel and the US. White Johannesburg was booming with the help of massive foreign investment: Barclays Bank and ICI proclaimed their support with shining new business palaces, and the blacks showed little outward sign of resistance except for a few scrawled slogans, such as 'Apartheid Means War'. </p> <p>I had a glimpse of the power of the state when I went to Pretoria to observe the trial. The Supreme Court was packed with armed police, who watched the spectators like hawks and took down all names. I sat on the press bench watching the prisoners being led up from the cells under the court. The familiar faces of Walter Sisulu, the Indian activist Ahmed Kathrada and Mandela, which I had seen so relaxed in their homes, now looked drawn and austere in their prison clothes: they were all facing a possible death sentence. Then Mandela looked back at the courtroom, recognised me, smiled and pointed me out to his colleagues. Instinctively I responded with the ANC clenched-fist salute. Immediately an Afrikaner policeman rushed up and beckoned me out of my seat. He questioned me for 10 minutes about how I knew the accused and what I was signalling to him, before I was allowed back, to the visible enjoyment of the prisoners.</p> <p>When the trial was adjourned I was approached by one of the defence lawyers, George Bizos, a stocky, bushy-haired Greek barrister who later became a close friend. He told me that Mandela was now asking me to advise him about the long speech he had prepared, with an eye on international opinion. So I spent an extraordinary evening in the lawyers' room alongside the court with the defence team, including Bizos, Arthur Chaskalson, Joel Joffe and Bram Fischer, the dedicated Afrikaner communist who led the defence. They showed me Mandela's long draft speech, which he had prepared in his own hand. I was engrossed by his moving testimony of his political development: how his tribal elders had first made him aware of African injustices, how he had widened his horizons and embraced the multiracial struggle with the help of communist allies, and how he had been compelled to begin the armed struggle when passive resistance was suppressed by the violence of the state. I made a few suggestions about the style and presentation, which were mostly ignored: probably rightly, for the text as it emerged was one of the historic speeches of the 20th century. I would always feel privileged to have been minimally involved in it, and to have worked briefly with these dedicated lawyers who would all become friends; for the first time I appreciated the law as the ultimate safeguard against autocracy.</p> <p>The end of the trial, on 12 June 1964, was my last sight of Mandela for 26 years, and my last glimpse of black South Africans before they entered a long age of darkness and repression.</p> <p>By the end of the Eighties, Nelson Mandela the prisoner had become an icon with little connection with reality. I could not relate the icon to the revolutionary I had known in the Fifties. For almost 30 years no photograph of him had appeared. In 1985 I had watched Oliver Tambo unveiling the huge bust of Mandela outside the Royal Festival Hall, but I could barely recognise the head, with thick lips and bull-neck like a Soviet workers' hero, quite unlike the expressive face I had known in the early Sixties. Newspapers and TV programmes kept preparing for his release and looked desperately around for anyone who knew anything about Mandela. 'You mean you actually knew him?' a CBS interviewer asked me with astonishment. I was tempted to romanticise a friendship with a legend and to suppress my first impressions of him as a touchy and arrogant man; and in truth I knew little about how he had developed in jail, though his lawyer, George Bizos, assured me he was a formidable presence. I still dreaded that his release would prove an anticlimax, revealing a tired old man of 71 emerging like Rip Van Winkle, hopelessly out of touch with the modern world. How could he confront a powerful military state and shrewd Afrikaner politicians determined to divide the black opposition? Mandela was worried while in prison, as he himself told me later, that his overblown fame had made people believe he was a superman. How much power could be wielded by a myth?</p> <p>And after 40 years watching the emergence of independent Africa I could not feel very optimistic about the black leadership. After the lesson of Nkrumah, the Redeemer of Ghana; Kenyatta, the Father of Kenya, and Amin, the Field Marshal of Uganda, western conservatives argued the message was clear: the Africans were simply unfit to govern themselves. </p> <p>Would Mandela and his colleagues be the same when they gained independence? After this African history I had to be sceptical. But since I had known them as young men I had always found the black South African politicians quite different from others in the continent, with their long history of patient resistance, their sense of discipline and their exposure to western ideas. And I had seen and heard enough of Mandela to know that he had developed into a much more serious leader than the demagogues in the north.</p> <p>To my growing frustration I was still banned from South Africa, over a piece I had written for The Observer, but I longed to show my wife Sally the country she had never seen. So in late 1989 I called on the friendly new South African ambassador in London. He reminded me courteously that I was still banned, but then explained that his government wanted the world to know how rapidly the situation was improving and eventually gave me a visa overwritten with the strange stipulation 'To assess the changing situation in South Africa in 18 days'.</p> <p>The country was changing much faster than I had ever imagined. In February 1990, two days before Sally and I flew to Johannesburg, President FW de Klerk made his historic speech to parliament, announcing that the African National Congress was unbanned and that Mandela would shortly be released. At Johannesburg airport the global media were already converging to report on the world's most famous prisoner. We stayed with my old friend Nadine Gordimer and watched with her the liberation of old friends who had been banned for 30 years, returning like ghosts from the past.</p> <p>The Johannesburg Star published long lists of people who were suddenly unbanned, including many old Drum writers, most of them dead, like Todd Matshikiza, Bloke Modisane or Can Themba, listed with aliases from the police files as if they were big-time criminals: 'Daniel Canadoce Temba, alias Temba Dan Can, alias Themba-Dorsay Can, alias Mvalise'. Nadine gave a party where our old friends speculated about the extent of the change. Zeke Mphahlele was still sceptical: 'It's easy for those in power to unban people: it doesn't mean they lose control.' Bram Fischer's daughter Ilse explained that her dead father's ashes were still banned, kept in prison. But we were thrilled to watch the crumbling of apartheid and the end of the 'collective madness' as Nadine called it, and I was delighted to see again politicians I had known 30 years before, with their values and ideals unchanged by prison, apparently oblivious of the hiatus.</p> <p>When I arranged to meet Ahmed Kathrada, Mandela's jail colleague, he suggested we meet 'near the flat' - meaning the place where we had last met when we were both in our twenties. I found Walter Sisulu, Mandela's mentor and jail colleague, in the Soweto box house where I used to see him in the Fifties. As he came out to welcome me, white haired but sprightly, he warned me to lock my car: 'Remember how Pat Duncan had his coat stolen.' </p> <p>Mandela was still in jail, but six days after we arrived we heard he would be released the next day. The following morning we caught a plane to Cape Town, to watch him make his first speech at the City Hall; but the streets were solid with crowds, so we drove to the British embassy, where we were now staying. We watched the historic event on television with the ambassador, Robin Renwick, and his colleagues, who gave us the diplomats' view. As Mandela spoke from the balcony in the fading twilight their faces fell and Renwick quickly left the room to telephone London. Mandela was reading a speech which had clearly been drafted by an ANC committee, reaffirming the militant policy and the armed struggle, while the diplomats had expected that he would present himself as an independent statesman and peacemaker. But it seemed to me that Mandela could only be useful if he remained loyal to the ANC: he could only make peace if he carried his people behind him.</p> <p>Mandela soon flew up to Johannesburg to address a mass rally and then returned to his small house in Soweto. When I telephoned the house, his wife Winnie answered. 'I keep pinching myself to believe that it's true,' she said, putting me straight through to Nelson, who talked as if nothing much had happened in 30 years. 'Hello, Tony, when are you coming here? How's the family?'</p> <p>Two days later I drove out with Sally to the box house in Vilikazi Street where I had visited him in the Sixties. An ANC flag was flying from the concrete garage - the flag which had been illegal two weeks before - and the house was surrounded by photographers and TV vans: schoolgirls were peeping through the garden wall into the small patch, where a tall black man with grey hair was talking to a TV team.At the door was Peter Magubane, the veteran Drum cameraman who was now Mandela's personal photographer. Over the past years he had frequently been detained for supporting the ANC, and had seen many false dawns: 'Is this really It?' I asked him.</p> <p>'Yes, it's It. They can't put it back.'</p> <p>In the house, we were greeted by Winnie, who was preparing a meal in the kitchen. Mandela strode in, looking far too big for the room, perfectly groomed in a double-breasted suit: his white hair shaky walk betrayed his 71 years, while his hug revealed the bony body beneath his tailoring. But he seemed much more serene than the man I remembered: his smile was no longer a wide showbiz grin but the relaxed, amused smile of someone at peace with himself. He sat down with his big boxer's hands resting on the dining-table, and asked about his London friends, Mary Benson and David Astor, who had sent him law books in jail. He looked Sally up and down and said: 'I remember Tony as a bright young man. He didn't tell me about you; he's kept things from me.'</p> <p>A few days later I went back again with three journalists. This time Mandela was the pure politician: he eloquently thanked the media for keeping the cause of liberation alive, and stressed that South Africa must have a free press. He praised Nadine Gordimer and said that my Anatomy of Britain had been the first book he had received in prison. He played down his own role and emphasised that he remained the loyal servant of the ANC. 'They may say: \"Well, you are a man of 71, you may require a pension.\" Or \"Look, we don't like your face, please go.\" I will obey them.'</p> <p>Back in London I still kept some contact with Mandela, for he practised diplomacy in a very personal way, relying on individual friends rather than bureaucrats. When I was able to see him later in Johannesburg he discussed how the ANC could rectify false reports in the British media: he gave me his home phone number and said: 'Why don't you just ring me when you see something that needs correcting?' - as his aide looked on in despair. </p> <p>I saw him again in April, when he paid a short, triumphant visit to London with Winnie, who appeared the ideal consort, gracious and attentive. He attended a pop concert at Wembley Stadium, addressing a crowd of 75,000 people, to thank them for their past support: 'You elected not to forget.' It was televised live by the BBC, which was attacked by right-wing conservatives who complained of political bias. In the interval Mandela moved through a crowded reception room, welcoming admirers. My daughter Katie was introduced to him, and he replied firmly: 'Remember you're a person in your own right.'</p> <p>There was much speculation about a meeting with Thatcher; Mandela's ANC colleagues insisted he must postpone it, but he persisted with his personal diplomacy. One Saturday night in June 1990 I was just going to sleep when Adelaide Tambo woke me with an odd request: 'My brother is in England and wants to see his girlfriend tomorrow morning.' The code meant Mandela wanted to see Thatcher. </p> <p>I rang her private secretary, Charles Powell, and early the next day Thatcher made a long phone call to Mandela. He urged her to maintain sanctions against Pretoria, without success; but she disarmed him by showing a maternal worry about his forthcoming trip to America: 'If you go on like this you won't come out alive.'</p> <p>After touring America, Mandela came back to London, where Thatcher was anxious to show her respect. Douglas Hurd gave a private lunch for his friends, including the president of the Anti-Apartheid Movement, Trevor Huddleston, South African MP Helen Suzman and myself. Mandela was appreciative, but restated the need to maintain sanctions, despite 'my sister Helen'. He went on to see Thatcher for the first time. Robin Renwick had urged her to let Mandela talk uninterrupted, since he had been waiting for 27 years incommunicado; he spoke for 52 minutes, before she replied for half an hour. She was warm and charming, Mandela told me, and he resented critics who complained he should not have talked to an enemy who had denounced him as a terrorist. He had to work with people who had done far worse things in South Africa, he explained: 'I didn't even mention slaughters.'</p> <p>In London the crowds gazed upon Mandela with reverent awe, which exasperated his critics, especially those who pointed to his conviction for terrorism. In fact, he was never a terrorist in either the Palestinian or the Israeli sense: he had taken up arms as the last resort to confront a terrorist state, and he had avoided any attack on civilians. But he was certainly never a spiritual leader: he was a master politician who understood the nature of power.</p> <p>I went back to South Africa frequently, which was still suspended between two disconnected worlds. When I called on Mandela and his colleagues in their brand-new office in Johannesburg they sounded confident that they would soon achieve power, yet in the interim they lacked any formal authority; while the whites in the suburbs appeared quite unaware of impending change and were doing little to adapt to it. Mandela, the old man who had been out of the world for a quarter of a century, was now, as Nadine Gordimer said, 'the personification of the future'; while many young whites were stuck in the past. </p> <p>The future at last began to take some shape when the government agreed to begin negotiations in the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa). When I talked with the ANC delegation they sounded confident that Mandela would soon become president and de Klerk his deputy; but there were all kinds of spoilers, including Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi and the right-wing Afrikaners. The negotiations continued on and off over two years, with recurring breakdowns, culminating in June 1993, when the thugs of the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Resistance Movement invaded the building, smashing through windows, to try to halt the talks. But at last, at the end of 1993, Mandela and de Klerk agreed on a new constitution and elections based on a simple one-person-one-vote system, and the first democratic elections were fixed for April 1994.</p> <p>Mandela was well aware that elections depended on cash: he had been raising funds round the world for the ANC ever since he left prison. He was never embarrassed by using his prestige to extract large sums of money from questionable people or former opponents. At the Dorchester Hotel in May 1993, before the election, he addressed a grand reception attended by the chairmen of most of the big companies, including Lord Weinstock of GEC and Lord King of British Airways, most of whom had opposed the ANC before it was legalised; now they queued up to shake Mandela's hand. Among them were scattered veteran anti-apartheid campaigners, who bristled as Mandela smiled and chatted with their ex-enemies. Trevor Huddleston was still filled with 'holy anger' and complained to me fiercely: how could Mandela forgive these villains? It was odd to hear the Christian father rebuking the political campaigner for being too forgiving. But Mandela had no time for recriminations, and he raised huge sums which eventually dwarfed de Klerk's election chest.</p> <p>The plans for elections went ahead, surrounded by hazards and uncertainties. The Afrikaner right wing refused to participate, and a band of extremists invaded the neighbouring bantustan of Bophuthatswana, until they met an ignominious defeat.</p> <p>'South Africa braced itself for a race war and civil war yesterday,' wrote the Sunday Times, the chief prophet of doom in London. Buthelezi also boycotted the elections and organised a march of Zulus through Johannesburg, which provoked deadly reprisals from the ANC. Then a week before election day he finally gave in, after pressure from all sides, and joined the elections.</p> <p>I flew out to Johannesburg with Sally to watch the elections in April 1994: the last surrender of white power in Africa. The walls and lampposts were plastered with Mandela posters and the initials ANC. They seemed at odds with the street names like Empire Way or Eton Road, or an estate called Settlers' Park.</p> <p>In the lily-white northern suburbs the prospect of a black government still seemed unimaginable. But Nadine's house was an island of continuity, the same as 40 years ago, and parts of Johannesburg were reverting to the multiracial existence I had known before apartheid. Sally and I went together to the musical Sophiatown, which featured the now-legendary Drum writers.</p> <p>Mandela was already being hailed as the victor. We went to the final ANC rally in the huge stadium near Soweto, where he arrived by helicopter and strode through the arena, with an entourage of drum majorettes, witch doctors and pop singers. He spoke like a president: when a gun went off he sternly rebuked the crowd. As he left in his car he reached out to shake my hand, but a security guard quickly intervened and closed the window.</p> <p>Two days later, at a press conference at the Carlton Hotel, Mandela radiated authority. He insisted on the importance of gun control and community policing: when he was asked about his personal feelings he would only say: 'Certain things cannot be expressed in words.'</p> <p>The mood was still tense, with fears of violence: on the eve of the election a bomb exploded at the airport, and on polling day another went off at the ANC headquarters downtown. But the polling stations in the townships were suffused with an extraordinary calm, as patient blacks lined up in winding queues for three or four hours to vote, while monitors from the UN or the Commonwealth watched for irregularities or intimidation. All the political violence was dissolved by the passionate faith in democracy.</p> <p>The next day I talked to Mandela at the Carlton Hotel, when he was clearly about to become president. Did he ever imagine 40 years earlier that he would be in this position? 'No, we were too busy fighting apartheid; and I was a junior then. I was convinced that there was no better leader than Tambo.' He rejected any praise of his personal leadership: 'No single individual can be elevated above others.' Could he not go too far in practising forgiveness and forgetting about evil? 'No,' he answered firmly. 'Men of peace must not think about recriminations or retribution; courageous people don't fear forgiving, for the sake of peace.'</p> <p>When the ANC victory was announced, with just short of two-thirds of the vote, there was no serious dispute. After all the predictions about bloodbaths, the power had been transferred from whites to blacks with little disruption. 'It was like being alive in the time of Lincoln,' wrote the New York Times. Only a few conservative journalists dissented: 'Dawn of freedom my foot,' wrote my old sparring-partner Peregrine Worsthorne in the Sunday Telegraph. 'Black majority rule in South Africa should send a shudder round the world.'</p> <p>On our last day, Sally and I went to a celebration lunch party given by Adelaide Tambo in her luxurious villa, where Walter Sisulu, the 80-year-old father figure of the struggle, was guest of honour. Adelaide gave a gracious speech thanking the foreign guests, including the British MPs Paul Boateng and Bob Hughes, David Dinkins, the mayor of New York, and myself. It was a first glimpse of old revolutionaries as they faced the responsibilities of power. Sisulu hugged me and said: 'We've done it.' What had they done? </p> <p>A few months later I visited the new ministers in their government offices. The guerrilla leader Joe Modise was now minister of defence; the ex-head of the Communist Party, Joe Slovo, was minister of housing. Parliament was transformed from an Afrikaner stronghold into a multiracial assembly full of bright tribal costumes. 'I love this dream,' said Archbishop Desmond Tutu. 'You sit in the balcony and look down and count all the terrorists. They are all sitting there passing laws. It is incredible.' </p> <p>The young minister, Pahad, drove us on a tour of the ministers' houses, enclosed in the beautiful and secluded Groote Schuur estate outside Cape Town. The old freedom fighters looked very unradical in those comfortable surroundings: we found Thabo Mbeki's father Govan, the Marxist firebrand, listening to Alistair Cooke's Letter from America. 'Now I know why you were all so keen for power,' I teased Pahad. 'But the funny thing is,' he replied, 'we didn't know all this was here.'</p> <p>When a minister asked me for advice on handling civil servants, I proposed that they watch the TV series Yes, Minister, but he replied: 'Oh, we've already seen the videos.' The transition on the surface was smoother than many had expected: the bureaucrats were keen to please, and the Afrikaner secretaries and security guards were soon calling the black ministers 'Sir'; power, in the end, had no colour bar. </p> <p>Mandela himself moved into the grand presidential offices as if he had always been groomed to be head of state: confident and courteous, springing out of his chair to greet a visitor, and introducing his Afrikaner PA, who brought the tea. I found him always welcoming and personal, asking about my family, reminiscing about old Drum friends, talking about London and the Queen Mother. But he was never off guard. He knew the impact of anything he said: if he said something slightly indiscreet he would instinctively put his hand over the tape recorder and he would always veer away from discussing his personal feelings.</p> <p>I was still fascinated by the story of how this serene president had developed from the headstrong revolutionary I had known in the Fifties; so I was excited when my publishers in 1995 suggested I write his authorised biography. Mandela asked me to breakfast in his house in Johannesburg, and said with customary flattery that he knew no one more qualified to write it: he wanted a biographer who had known him in his earlier political years, provided I didn't mention we had met in a shebeen.</p> <p>\u2022 Anthony Sampson was on the staff of The Observer from 1955 to 1966 and its chief US correspondent from 1973 to 1974.

  "<p>There is a rum old scene going off in a suite of the Grosvenor House Hotel on London's swish Park Lane: a fractious exchange between Roy Jones Jr's 'people' and a journalist. </p> <p>The journalist is repeatedly being told how bad for Jones it 'will play in the States' and the consequences for the scribe and his newspaper 'if it's printed'. At last Jones' representatives wander into the corridor, the journalist leaves and the PR from fight broadcaster Setanta is dismissed after a terse upbraiding. It is finally time for the audience with Jones, the former four-weight world champion who on 8 November will attempt to strip Joe Calzaghe of his 45-fight unbeaten record in New York. </p> <p>Except, the man considered the world's best pound-for-pound fighter during the 1990s, who at 39 is estranged from a domineering father and later states his retirement will consist of 'fishing and ladies - I love the ladies', is not in the bedroom. This last point is telling because of what now occurs. </p> <p>Observer Sport is warned by Jones' minders not to broach the offending topic, but when the fighter appears and is left alone he happily begins riffing, unprompted and with no apparent concern, on the forbidden subject.</p> <p>He is asked about the loneliness a boxer feels once he steps under the show lights and on to the canvas - and that is all it takes to get him going on cockfighting. 'That's why I used to relate to the Cajun chickens because you can use them,' he says in his understated southern drawl. 'You can relate to what that's like because every time they fight they could die. It don't mean that they would, but they could.' </p> <p>Jones Junior is passionate about cockfighting, a blood sport that pits in mortal combat specially bred chickens - often with a curved spike known as a cockspur attached to their legs. Over the years he bred around 1,200 roosters and hens on his farm in the Florida cornfields 25 miles north of Pensacola, his small home town on the Gulf of Mexico. He would drive them to Louisiana where cockpits were still legal, before it became the final US state to outlaw the sport last year. </p> <p>A minder still failing to appear through the open bedroom door, Jones has more to say. 'Back in the old days soldiers used to fight chickens while at war because it would give them a sense of what they were dealing with. You understand me? </p> <p>'Now they're just so eager about animals - so they don't allow you to do it. But to let them fight like that you've got to love them. It's like a coach and his fighter - training and teaching him to box.' </p> <p>The spectacle of warring roosters has such resonance for Jones that in his alternative career as a rapper, in his Body Head Bangerz hip-hop outfit, he spat the lyrics: 'You remember the left hook James Toney got? Sucker move I stole from a game cock', to commemorate a victory in November 1994 that made him the IBF super-middleweight champion.</p> <p>That was his second divisional world title. He had vacated the IBF middleweight belt he won the previous year on a unanimous decision against Bernard Hopkins, the man Calzaghe defeated the last time he fought in April. </p> <p>Jones was a sublime, menacing fighting machine. He was in his scintillating pomp from the moment he was denied Olympic gold at the 1988 Seoul Games by judges the IOC subsequently named as cheats until 16 years later when he was finally defeated by an opponent - if you discount the controversial disqualification against Montell Griffin in 1997. </p> <p>But having fought professionally in three decades he admits to being sickened at what his sport can produce. 'You wouldn't want to watch a bad situation,' he says, conceding he could never see a tape of a boxer being seriously injured. 'You don't want to see that happen to no other fighter.' </p> <p>Jones, a deeply religious man who describes his relationship with God as 'the only thing that kept me going through this whole thing', understands that potential disaster is always near. </p> <p>'Every fighter is close to that every time they go in the ring. It can happen any time. You don't know when it could.' </p> <p>In February 1995 it happened to his friend Gerald McClellan, when he lost to Britain's Nigel Benn in a particularly brutal WBC super-middleweight title fight. Stopped in the 10th round, McClellan, a dog-fighting fan who had beaten Jones as an amateur, slipped into a prolonged coma. He lost his eyesight, could not walk and is now almost completely deaf. At 27 his life had changed forever. </p> <p>Has Jones ever watched the bout? 'You would never watch that fight again. You wouldn't want to watch it,' he says, quietly. </p> <p>Had he visited McClellan since the bout? 'I don't need to - it would make me quit boxing.' </p> <p>Quit? 'Yeah.' </p> <p>Why? He repeats: 'Cos it'd make me quit boxing.' </p> <p>Pressed further he says: 'My reason would be more because I don't want to do that to nobody.' </p> <p>Is it a worry that he has the potential to do so? 'You wouldn't want to be the one who did it.' </p> <p>Jones's quiet manner can make him seem uninterested, but he is actually thoughtful and open to most subjects. And, despite having taken his share of blows during 134 amateur and 52 professional fights, he is still of clear mind. </p> <p>'That's my strong point. With me I come in the ring and start thinking right away,' he says. 'My thought process is just to put a guy down. I'm like a technician and learn to break it all down - from head to toe.' </p> <p>But he returns to what can happen to even the very best of fighters. </p> <p>'I don't think Nigel Benn was the same after he did that to Gerald. I fought </p> <p>Gerald once,' he says. 'He was a very good fighter.' </p> <p>Roy Levesta Jones Junior, who was born in Pensacola in January 1969, has three sisters, a brother - 'He fought for a little while, we had separate moms' - and describes his childhood as 'pretty good'. </p> <p>He has also described it as tough, but says his father, known as Big Roy, 'was the best coach' and that 'probably the worst thing that happened to me was separating from my dad'.</p> <p>Jones Senior, a Vietnam veteran who was a boxer 'before I knew it', began tutoring his son aged five. That was a year before he gave him a shotgun as a present.</p> <p>And Big Roy, believing a tough trade needed harsher love, was highly critical. He deployed a PVC pipe on his son if skipping or bag-work was not up to standard and terrified him to such an extent that Jones Jr says: 'After a while I didn't care about getting hurt or dying any more.</p> <p>'I was in pain every day. I was so scared of my father. He'd pull up in his truck and start looking for something I'd done wrong. There was no escape, no excuse, no way out of nothing. Every day it was the same: school, homework, farm work, training. Getting hurt or dying might've been better than the life I was living.</p> <p>'So I turned into a daredevil. I'd do anything. Didn't make much difference. Used to think about killing myself anyway.' </p> <p>The estrangement took place in 1992. Was there an argument? 'No argument. Just a situation that happened - and it was time to go.' Pressed, Jones repeats that it was 'just time to go'. </p> <p>In fact there was a final incident. Having announced he would never fight again following the travesty in Seoul that gave South Korea's Park Si-Hun gold, Jones reversed his decision when he returned a hero. 'That defeat was the best thing that ever happened because 20 years later they're still talking about it,' he says. </p> <p>But after turning professional in 1989 his father's cautious approach reduced him to fighting at fairgrounds. Jones was making no money and title fights were being refused without his knowledge. If Big Roy had maintained control it is unclear if Jones would ever have realised a potential that has also won him five different world titles and the Boxing Writers Association of America's vote as Fighter of the Decade. </p> <p>Then came the final incident when Big Roy killed a rottweiler, which belonged to a friend of Jones Jr, after it had bitten his sister Catandrea. The dog was tied to a tree and Big Roy unloaded three cartridges from a shotgun into its head and two bullets from a Glock 9mm pistol. For Jones, it was a cold-blooded execution and he hired Alton Merkerson, his trainer at the Seoul Games, to take his father's place. </p> <p>Could there ever be a reconciliation? 'No,' Jones says, his tone suggesting he should not be challenged. Yet, there was a rapprochement, which, perhaps because it was unsuccessful, Jones does not mention. It happened when the worst two years of his career took him into a third bout against Antonio Tarver in October 2005. </p> <p>Having become the first former middleweight champion in 106 years to win the world heavyweight title by beating John Ruiz in March 2003 - on a unanimous decision to secure a title he never defended - Jones was awarded a split decision in his first meeting with Tarver that November. </p> <p>This was back down in the light-heavyweight division, which he had dominated since beating Griffin, in their first fight, for the WBC belt six years earlier. But a rematch against Tarver in May 2004 ended in Jones' first defeat - since the disqualification - when Tarver knocked him out in the second round. Even worse followed when Glen Johnson - a far inferior opponent to Tarver - stopped Jones in the ninth round in Memphis that September. </p> <p>It was 15 minutes before Jones could leave the ring. Desperate, he recalled Big Roy - while still also retaining Merkerson - for the first time in 13 years ahead of the deciding fight of his series with Tarver. </p> <p>He lost a unanimous decision in 12 rounds. It was a third successive loss, which had apparently finished his career and made Calzaghe's verdict following the Johnson defeat seem all the more damning: 'I hope Roy decides to retire. I'm not at all interested in facing someone who has been knocked out in both of his last fights. </p> <p>'It is the end of an era and I am as disappointed as anyone that I never managed to face him.' </p> <p>Jones Jr has since redeemed his reputation with some big wins. In view of his impending light-heavyweight contest against Calzaghe, what does he think of the Welshman's assessment of four years ago that he was supposedly washed up? 'It did seem like it was the end of an era then, but it don't seem like it now,' he says, laughing. 'They don't think like that now.' </p> <p>So, at Madison Square Garden next month, who will win? 'Me,' Jones says. 'A week before I'll start looking at Joe - see if I need to make any adjustment. He has weaknesses. But I most definitely respect him.' </p> <p>Whatever the result - it is not clear-cut - business will continue. 'I'm thinking about going up to heavyweight because Wladimir Klitschko [IBF world champion] says he'll fight me. I know I can get him.' </p> <p>Jones is clear, though, that none of his three sons - he also has three daughters - will ever fight. 'It's like a mother don't want to see her kids go out to war because they might never come back.' </p> <p>In 10 years' time, Jones will be closing in on 50. What might he be doing? 'Plenty. Dealing with the ladies - I love women; I do rap music; I fish a lot - I've got a 36-foot boat. </p> <p>'Fishing keeps you alive, gives you time away - to enjoy God, the creations that He made. Because God made you.'</p>",
  "<p>Dean Richards, in his wry, dry way, had said that should his Harlequins find themselves in the clear again, as they had been against the Ospreys last week in Swansea, they wouldn't let their opponents sneak in to pinch the win. As if Richards' boys would ever be in a position to take control at Stradey Park... the notion was ludicrous. </p> <p>And not just to the one-eyed Scarlets fans. There was no hiding from the score: at half-time, Harlequins were 19-3 down and had manifested not one jot of desire or nous to do anything but go home bearing the marks of a good smacking. </p> <p>But there would appear to be a canny strategy at work here. Planning for two games in West Wales - the Ospreys in the EDF Energy Cup and the Scarlets in the Heineken Cup - seemed to be based on energy-saving, or to be more specific, not bothering with the first half. </p> <p>It nearly worked for the Londoners' second string at the Liberty Stadium, and their second-half performance rattled the Ospreys. But the first team at Stradey Park ran into such a first-half mess that the game looked absolutely done and dusted before the Harlequins were primed for their favourite period. </p> <p>The trouble began from the start of play, a clearance falling into the arms of Darren Daniel, who passed inside to big Australian David Lyons. The No 8 made ground, set up a ruck and the ball was passed wide to Morgan Stoddart. The full-back skipped out of the grasp of Charlie Amesbury and the scoring was underway. </p> <p>The Scarlets were looking to run the ball, and the midfield pairing of Regan King and Gavin Evans threatened to split the visitors apart with every move they tried. Sometimes they passed it hard and flat to the outside, while dummy runners kept the defence tied to the inside lines; sometimes they slipped shorter passes to each other. Every which way, they bamboozled their opponents. </p> <p>They scored a second try with this invention, Mark Jones taking advantage of the space created, straight from a scrum, by his centres. A third should perhaps have followed.</p> <p>But if the tries stayed at a pair in the first half, Stephen Jones kept the numbers rolling upwards with three penalties. And all the while, Harlequins offered nothing. In possession they booted the ball downfield. Energy-saving maybe, but more obviously mind-numbing. They did slot one penalty when Stoddart failed to release one of the countless kicks that came his way. </p> <p>Then it suddenly was not so daft after all. The second half began and before the Scarlets had even got the first syllable of consolidation out, they were watching two penalties from Chris Malone sailing over. </p> <p>The home team recovered to land a penalty of their own, and as the game grew looser and scrappier it seemed that this would suit them. </p> <p>But a turning point came when prop Kees Meeuws, an old All Black prop who might have known better, launched himself horizontally into a ruck. No protocols were needed to reveal the illegality here - a human missile not binding is against the laws of nature. </p> <p>Harlequins worked their way forward from the penalty and were awarded another in the Scarlets 22. Danny Care tapped it to himself and scored. They were within six points. </p> <p>Then within three, with the additional bonus of playing against 14 for 10 minutes. Matthew Rees put in a late tackle on Tani Fuga and was sent to the sin-bin. Malone put over the penalty and the visitors were no longer a laughing stock. </p> <p>The creases on the brows of the crowd at this last Heineken Cup game at the wonderful dump that is Stradey Park - Parc y Scarlets in mid-November - soon deepened into furrows. Malone kicked - every one now a little gem - and Ugo Monye sped on to the sweetly bouncing ball. Malone converted and the Quins were in front. </p> <p>At this point, Rees returned, but instead of finding a ship steadied he found panic. Balls were fumbled at the base of rucks, balls off boots fell into areas controlled by opponents. </p> <p>Gavin Evans pulled off one quite brilliant catch to keep a movement alive, only to see his forwards lose the tussle for repossession to Fuga. The tackle area was now controlled by the team who had not had a clue in the first half. </p> <p>Malone landed a final penalty to bring the remarkable turnaround to its conclusion. The strategy of playing whole games by the half would appear to have something going for it.</p> <p><strong>Stradey Park:</strong> 8,236</p> <p><strong>Scarlets:</strong> Stoddart, Daniel, King (Higgitt 69), G Evans, M Jones (C Thomas 75); S Jones, Martens; I Thomas, Rees, Meeuws, Cooper, Maling (MacLeod 30), Easterby (capt), G Thomas, Lyons</p> <p><strong>Tries</strong> Stoddart, M Jones (3) <strong>Pens</strong> S Jones (4)</p> <p><strong>Harlequins:</strong> Brown, Amesbury, Tiesi (Taione 69), Turner-Hall, Monye; Malone, Care (Gomarsall 78); C Jones, Botha (Fuga 54), Ross, Kohn (Robson 54), J Evans, Robshaw, Skinner (capt), Guest (Easter 54)</p> <p><strong>Tries</strong> Care, Monye <strong>Cons</strong> Malone (2) <strong>Pens</strong> Malone (5)</p> <p><strong>Referee</strong> C Berdos (France)</p>",

'I've never had this reaction to anything I've been involved with; nothing in my life,' says Nick Raphael, MD of Sony's Epic Records, the man who signed Jay-Z in the UK, steered Charlotte Church and made a star of Lemar. 'Could it be the biggest record of the year? Yes.' Radiohead's string arranger is on board, David Bailey's done the photos, manager Sam Wright counts Eminem, Marilyn Manson and Bon Jovi among her former charges. Yesterday a film crew flew in from New York. Tonight's show is being recorded for some 354 US TV stations. The man from William Morris, Hollywood talent agency with Britney, Kanye and the Rolling Stones on its books, has been sniffing around since breakfast. It all smells like gravy to him and he's keen to broker a US tour - before anyone else does. All the time the clamour around these three guys, the Priests, gets louder and louder.</p> <p>'I've played songs to other producers and to family and friends,' says Mike Hedges, producer to U2, the Cure and the Manic Street Preachers, 'and it's the best reaction to any record I've ever done. People say \"It actually gives me goose bumps.\" How often do you get that these days?' </p> <p>With a name like the Priests, you might be expecting a bony young garage band or some fun-loving LA funkateers. The Priests are not that. They're ... well, they're priests.</p> <p>Say salve! to Father Eugene O'Hagan, aged 48, of the parish of Ballyclare and Ballygowan. To his brother Father Martin O'Hagan, aged 45, of the parish of Cushendun and to their old school friend Father David Delargy, aged 44, of the parish of Hannahstown, all in the diocese of Down and Connor. Three full-time clergymen from Belfast whose roles tending to the spiritual needs of their parishioners will now run parallel to the lives of jet-set singing stars. Released for Christmas, the Priests' album is expected to make them household names. </p> <p>Tonight, though, they'll be rocking St Patrick's Cathedral, Armagh. 'Backstage' is an adjacent school, commandeered by the production team for an event boasting a 30-strong orchestra and a 20-stong choir, overseen by former Top of the Pops director Chris Cowey. 'We didn't want it to look like Songs of Praise,' explains Raphael. 'We wanted it to look like a Hollywood version of a church concert.' On the set list: 'Panis Angelicus', 'Be Thou My Vision' and 'Benedictus'; songs the priests had sung since coming together 35 years ago in a Belfast boarding school where their religious fervour saw the trio nicknamed 'Holy Holy Holy'. They completed their seminary training at the Gregorian University in Rome, where their singular blend of voices - two tenors (Fathers Eugene and Martin) and a light baritone (Father David) - earned them an invite to perform the sacred liturgy for Pope John Paul II at the Vatican. Now Sony hope the Priests' songbook will chime with a previously untapped market - the world's 1.1 billion Catholics. 'These guys are presenting something that's part of people's lives and you can't buy a copy of what they're doing,' says Raphael. 'It's a memento.' </p> <p>But it's not just Catholics. With a non-partisan emphasis on the 'spiritual' and the 'uplifting' - and with the likes of 'Ave Maria', the 'very familiar' - plus songs sung in French and Spanish, the album has been designed with the broadest of churches in mind. It's catholic with a small 'c'. 'Someone said to me \"Wow, this is like God's Greatest Hits,\"' says manager Wright. 'Good songs are good songs. They don't have to be by Paul Weller or Kate Rusby; there are some great hymns out there. You can't tell me 'Ave Maria' isn't a cracking tune.'</p> <p>The Priests see no contradiction in joining the music business. It may even have been preordained. 'Certainly we see the hand of God's providence in this opportunity,' says Father Eugene. 'It's a chance for us to take the music and bring a message to an increasingly, well, agnostic world. Hopefully through these lovely tunes people will be uplifted spiritually. It's as broad as that.'</p> <p>'It's an opportunity to portray faith but we hope by its very nature it will cross all boundaries,' adds Father Martin. 'We hope it will speak to all.'</p> <p>You might say people's spirits have already been uplifted by the news of three singing priests. They've been dubbed 'Father Ted: the Musical' and 'Priestlife'. Since they signed their recording contract on the steps of Westminster Cathedral in April, an ITV crew have been following them about, ahead of a documentary next month. Even now the man from the Times has them cornered over a plate of iced buns in the school's makeshift refectory. 'Will you be spokesmen for the Church?' he presses. 'On a subject, say, like abortion?' </p> <p>Father Eugene affords him a munificent look. 'If someone wants to have a debate about abortion, there are priests who can do that. We are not those priests,' he says. 'We're not media spokesmen.'</p> <p>Yet as the Armagh concert proves, you could hardly hope to find three more media-ready people. Commanding an audience is part of their job. They're people people. Between some remarkable harmonising the Priests banter away warmly, explaining the origins of Vivaldi's 'Gloria: Domine, Fili Unigenite', paying homage to their late choral teacher and finding room for a couple of jokes. You don't imagine many new record company signings are blessed with such diplomatic chops. By the finale of 'Abide With Me' sections of the audience are in tears. In a good way, obviously.</p> <p>But the Priests aren't going to have it easy. It's no secret that Ireland is stretched for clergy as it is, with numbers expected to fall by two-thirds within 20 years. So a clause in their contract stipulates their priestly duties must be prioritised; that any promotional activity will be curtailed should a call come from their parishes. (Obviously you won't be seeing them on telly on a Sunday.) </p> <p>'There are 20 newspapers, radio stations and TV in every country when everyone's interested in releasing your record,' says Wright. 'That's a tall order for the Rolling Stones, let alone people with a day job.' Particularly when said day job has included such rigours as giving a funeral to a stillborn child, administering the last rites to the victim of a punishment shooting and - in Father David's case - having three churches firebombed during the Troubles. </p> <p>So when David Bailey, bless him, tried it on at their photo session, asking 'What are three grown men like you doing still believing in God, then?' and showing off his Damien Hirst, a portrait of Jesus bleeding to death on the cross above the legend 'Was it worth it?', the Priests had little trouble turning the other cheek. (Father David took a photo of Hirst on his phone.)</p> <p>The reality of the Priests' contractual clause is demonstrated a few days later. We had agreed to meet in a London hotel, but Father David has been called back to his parish for a funeral. But Fathers Eugene and Martin have joie de vivre to spare. 'Quite a line-up, isn't it?' booms Father Martin on being told that he is now labelmates with Ozzy Osbourne, Britney and My Chemical Romance. </p> <p>'A very ecumenical line-up!' twinkles Father Eugene.</p> <p>Do they hope to convert any errant pop stars? </p> <p>'Well, we won't go out deliberately to do so,' he continues. 'We're not going out to evangelise. But you never know what doors might open.'</p> <p>('There's goodness to find in everyone,' Father David says later. 'Ozzy is a husband and a father. I'm not even sure it was a real bat. That was theatre. Does the devil have the best tunes? I don't think even Ozzy believes that.')</p> <p>The Priests will be wearing their clerical clothing at all times. In a sense, that's good branding: one that's been around for 2,000 years. (It also underlines the project's authenticity - everyone involved is at pains to point out that this is Not A Gimmick.)</p> <p>'Before people have shunned the ecclesiastic badge ... ' says Father David.</p> <p>'An attempt to be trendy,' notes Father Eugene.</p> <p>Recently things seem to have gone the other way. Morrissey's been sporting a dog collar ... </p> <p>'And Pete Doherty with a rosary!' cries Father Eugene. 'Yes, I saw those beads, yes. Perhaps if he'd use them, instead of just wearing them ... '</p> <p>They've very nice, the Priests. Meeting them you realise the idea of middle-aged singing clergy perhaps isn't so far away from the dynamics of a boyband after all. There's cheeky-chappie Eugene, mildly camp David and boyish Martin. </p> <p>'Father Ted meets Westlife?' Father Eugene muses. 'I found that show very funny; it did take a tongue-in-cheek approach to matters ecclesiastical. We certainly had a sneaking admiration for some of the characters. Westlife on the other hand? We take great exception to that ... '</p> <p>Are they prepared for that perennial pop question: 'Which one's your favourite'?</p> <p>'Don't tell us that! We don't need to know!' they wail. ('I know who's the favourite already,' says Mike Hedges. 'It's Martin, isn't it? Didn't you notice after the show all the girls came up to Martin for his autograph? Loads and loads of quite attractive girls. Eugene was a little bit put out, I think. In the nicest possible way.')</p> <p>It would be a mistake to write the Priests off as fuddy-duddies. Sony has given them their own YouTube channel. And they're already blogging away like mad. Sure, there was some early confusion in the studio over earmuffs ('Hedges said to them: \"Let's get one thing straight,\"' explains Nick Raphael. 'They're either \"cans\" or \"headphones\". Never \"earmuffs'\") but Father Eugene reveals himself to be little short of a fully fledged gadget-head; all high-speed connection this and BlackBerry that. One afternoon I asked, somewhat patronisingly, if they were familiar with iTunes.</p> <p>'Oh yes! 79p per item,' piped Father Eugene. </p> <p>Which was me told. But even that paled next to the interviewer who played the 'What-was-the-first-record-you-bought?', card only to get the following answer from Father David: 'Parallel Lines by Blondie.'</p> <p>Mike Hedges, a former Jesuit choirboy whose CV happily already includes the Cure's Faith, the Undertones' The Sin of Pride and the Manic Street Preachers, had always wanted to give the whistles-and-bells treatment to recording the Latin Mass. Raphael wasn't convinced, but after his eight-year-old son came home from a wedding service singing the Feeling's 'I Thought it Was Over' in the drawn-out style in which priests say 'Aaa-men' and a colleague confided 'It's not the stupidest idea ever.' He commissioned a search. Liam Bradley, drummer for Van Morrison and Ronan Keating, tracked down the three Fathers who had already appeared on Irish TV. 'I said, \"Let's get the best one,\"' remembers Raphael. 'Then I got told \"No, no, no ... they don't come separately.\"' </p> <p>Then he called Hedges. Who was appalled.</p> <p>'I imagined this wonderful, baroque Latin Mass. When he mentioned three priests I thought, \"That's a bit tacky and gimmicky. I'm not sure about that.\"' Then he heard them sing and, says Raphael, 'went completely nuts'. The Priests were given carte blanche to suggest the songs they'd like to record. And they'll be donating the profits - well, most of them - to charity. 'We thought very carefully and took time to ascertain the implications of the decision,' Father Eugene says. 'Still, it's taken some adjustment. We were flattered and bewildered to find paparazzi following us.'</p> <p>In fact, everyone's been bowled over by the reaction - both from the music market and the Church, who gave their blessing from the off (two Vatican choirs will record accompaniment in St Peter's Basilica this month). 'As opposed to the record company being the evil empire who cook up these mad schemes, this could not have happened less like a mad scheme. It couldn't be any further away from what all the people involved normally do,' says Raphael, who spent the mid-1990s in that famously sacrosanct enterprise of playing handbag house in Leeds nightclubs, wearing a PVC miniskirt as half of DJ duo Trannies With Attitude. 'Every day the odds are shortening that it could be Christmas No 1. On this project we seem to get every break we want.'</p> <p>'It's almost like something's willing it to happen,' he adds, mysteriously.</p> <p>'There's no disconnect with priests selling music in this way,' says Dr Andrew Cameron-Mowat of Heythrop Theology College, University College of London. 'Vivaldi was a priest. Sydney MacEwan, the Scottish tenor, was ordained in the 1940s and carried on singing to raise a lot of money for Oban Cathedral. And Father Rossi in Brazil has thousands of people coming to his masses; he's sold 3m copies on CD. It's not like priests take a vow of poverty. And if they didn't have the talent, they wouldn't be doing it.'</p> <p>What's more, these priests will be bringing their own fanbase. One afternoon I watch Father Eugene preside over a wedding at his Sacred Heart Church. Outside his parishioners are buzzing. 'I hope his CD does well,' says Jackie Vance. 'I know a lot of people who'll be buying it already.'</p> <p>'We're very pleased for all of them,' says Catherine Acton. 'I think they'll be able to keep the balance pretty well.'</p> <p>Seventy-two hours later the trio are in the dressing room at The Alan Titchmarsh Show - gardener turned chatshow host. 'He's diversified, like us,' notes Father Eugene - their entry into the world of light entertainment confirmed by today's other guests: Kelvin MacKenzie, Heather Small, Boy George and a retired greyhound.</p> <p>'Putting the religion back into Christmas,' suggests Titchmarsh backstage. 'What a novel idea.'</p> <p>'Really this is a just a continuation of what we've always tried to do,' concludes Father Martin. 'It's about communication. As our old singing teacher used to say: \"What comes from the heart, goes to the heart.\"'</p>",
  "<p>What is the collective noun for mothers-in-law? This might sound like the start of a joke, except I can only guess at its punch line. As far as I know, the word has yet to be coined, but might be inspired by Luisa Dillner's splendidly exhaustive - and never exhausting - book, in which an extraordinary crowd of mothers-in-law historical, fictional, contemporary and anonymous gathers. Dillner proves adept at crowd control, carrying out her introductions with even-handed energy, in the style of an uncommonly sensible parent.</p> <p>I have a hunch it is her publisher that may have dreamt up the book's subtitle with a calculating eye to Christmas sales. For the truth is that although the book is sympathetic towards the challenges of being a mother-in-law and contains portraits of the best of the breed, it is a far more complicated take on the subject than 'celebration' would suggest. It is rich with mad, bad, dangerous mothers-in-law - and warped son and daughters-in-law. Nor does it try to duck evil-mother-in-law jokes and their history.</p> <p>Yet there is much benign humour too. I particularly liked, even if it is a little hard to believe, the anecdote about Marilyn Monroe meeting Arthur Miller's mother. At the end of dinner, Marilyn slipped away to the lavatory where she ran both taps in order not to overhear Mrs Miller pronounce on her new daughter-in-law. When the verdict came, as it did much later, it was that Marilyn was a 'sweet' girl, but that it was a pity she 'pissed like a horse'.</p> <p>Dillner judiciously starts the book by writing about her own mother-in-law. No problems there: 'Maggie' is an attractive, discreetly flamboyant woman (she is, among other things, a Pearly Queen). But one casual detail reveals an ambivalence inevitable even in the best mother/daughter-in-law relationships. Dillner says her mother-in-law is proud of her career as a writer/journalist, but then adds, neutrally, that Maggie chooses not to take the paper (the Guardian) for which her daughter-in-law writes. If there is one thing Dillner could have examined more fully, it is the nuanced slights of this sort, the almost invisible needling and bids for independence that go with the territory.</p> <p>It is interesting to monitor, as the book progresses, the seesawing of the balance of power between mothers-in-law and children-in-law. This changes depending on which country you drop into and which period of history. I would not want to have been a daughter-in-law in China's Sung dynasty (960-1279), where an abject - or subjected - daughter-in-law (a masochistic co-dependant in modern terms) prays that her life be shortened in order that her mother-in-law should last longer.</p> <p>Queen Victoria was an affectionately doughty (if not amused) mother-in-law. But she was dictatorial about breast-feeding, not wanting her daughters-in-law to be 'cows'. Princess Diana has a natural place in the narrative, too, as the daughter-in-law who continued to make her mother-in-law's life a nightmare posthumously. </p> <p>Elsewhere, the book is packed with stories to remind us that there is nothing new about dysfunctional families. It is fascinating to consider literary figures such as Keats, Virginia Woolf and Edgar Allan Poe in the light of their relations with their in-laws. Poe's mother-in-law was nicknamed 'Muddy' but her behaviour to her defective son-in-law was selflessly pure; Mrs Brawne, although loving, described Keats as 'mad' and wished he'd give up poetry; Virginia Woolf was beastly about her mother-in-law but wrote a fascinating, almost sympathetic, portrait of her after her death.</p> <p>This book ends with sound, humane, entertaining advice to all in-laws on how to better their relationships. It would make a superb, stimulating, safe present to a mother-in-law - or from one.</p>",
  "<p>For the past six years the Icelandic investors of Baugur have been worshipped like rock stars in the British retail sector. Handsome executive chairman Jon Asgeir Johannesson seduced the Square Mile as he strutted up the high street, window-shopping for fashion stores and jewellers.</p> <p>The group's chic black-panelled New Bond Street offices in the heart of London's shopping district look more like a trendy nightclub than the corporate headquarters of a \u00a35bn-turnover retail business, complete with a sculpture of a Viking carrying a guitar and giant fishtank. Baugur has bought stakes in a swath of high street retailers including French Connection, Moss Bros and Debenhams, often in league with fashion entrepreneur Kevin Stanford, who co-founded Karen Millen.</p> <p>But this weekend, Baugur's empire, which includes House of Fraser and Hamleys the toy store, could be broken up as British tycoon Sir Philip Green stands poised to plunder its choicest assets. If he succeeds, it will mark the end of a Nordic retail invasion that has swept across Britain in the last seven years.</p> <p>Home to just 300,000 people, Iceland is seen to epitomise the global credit boom that has turned to bust. Over the past eight years its banks expanded dramatically overseas and by 2007 their assets amounted to about nine times the country's gross domestic product. All that changed last week. Its three largest banks, Kaupthing, Glitnir and Landsbanki, are now under state control. Baugur could be the next domino to fall.</p> <p>There has long been scepticism over Baugur's financial health, especially as it was so closely linked with Icelandic banks. But Baugur chief executive Gunnar Sigurdsson always insisted that the Icelandic banks held only minority shareholdings and - in a worst case scenario - if their positions were liquidated standard pre-emption clauses would apply, giving shareholders the right to acquire their stakes. He continues to stand firmly on this line. </p> <p>Baugur's investments include supermarket chain Iceland; jewellery group Aurum Holdings, which owns Goldsmiths and Mappin &amp; Webb; and Mosaic Fashions, a fashion group which owns eight brands including Coast, Karen Millen, Oasis, Principles and Warehouse and employs an estimated 53,000 people.</p> <p>Some Baugur investments have already turned sour in the past year but they were considered small fry. Value chain MK One ended up in administration while health food chain Julian Graves was sold. The group has tried to restore confidence by issuing trading updates from Aurum and Mosaic. These showed that underlying sales were up 7.4 per cent at Aurum in the last year, although operating profits fell 2.6 per cent to \u00a39.3m after it switched to selling lower-margin watches. Mosaic reported earnings up 6 per cent to \u00a333.4m in the six months to 26 July on sales of \u00a3410m.</p> <p>Johannesson is the son of a supermarket retailer. With the help of his father and cheap Icelandic financing, Baugur expanded aggressively overseas. The company's rise coincided with that of Iceland's financial community as the country became a major force in Europe using cheap money to build up massive property and retail investments.</p> <p>But Iceland's banks also tended to invest in each other. A tendency for aggressive borrowing, as well as a policy of taking equity stakes in property and retail ventures, meant that problems in one bank infected others and compounded their problems.</p> <p>The biggest individual UK casualty of the Icelandic bank crash is Robert Tchenguiz. Last Wednesday the colourful tycoon was forced to sell substantial stakes in J Sainsbury and pub group Mitchell &amp; Butler at a loss estimated to be in the region of \u00a3800m.</p> <p>Friends of Tchenguiz, who is keeping a low profile while he assesses his options, say that he is 'keeping a brave face' on what is a stunning fall to earth for the sociable financier. One of those options could include legal redress. When it became clear that Iceland's government would not guarantee British savers' deposits, Gordon Brown reacted with fury. He invoked terrorist legislation to freeze assets associated with Icelandic banks.</p> <p>The decision, say Kaupthing insiders, effectively led to the collapse of the bank and precipitated Tchenguiz's startling losses. </p> <p>Tchenguiz's aides and Kaupthing insiders refuse to acknowledge that it may have been the bank's unsustainable borrowings against assets whose value could not be justified that lay behind its downfall.</p> <p>While Tchenguiz's substantial property holdings are said by sources close to the tycoon to be in good shape, his equities business has been 'annihilated'. His brother Vincent is also thought to have lost tens of millions in the wake of the Icelandic disaster through his interests in Consensus Business Group.</p> <p>The brash Candy brothers, who are behind some of the most ambitious upmarket residential developments in London, appear to have benefited from Kaupthing's demise. The development arm of the Candy empire was involved in a number of joint ventures with Kaupthing but has exercised options to snap up a Beverley Hills project in the US as well as a residential scheme on the former Middlesex Hospital site in central London as Kaupthing liquidates its assets.</p> <p>Some suggest, though, that the brothers are set to suffer in the downturn because of large costs associated with their central London housing schemes, which could now be difficult to sell. The Candys have indicated that they are prepared to mothball sites.</p> <p>The Icelandic banking community is furious with Prime Minister Geir Haarde for marching into Glitnir, the third biggest bank, last week. It accuses him of being a 'left-wing green' who has no understanding of financial intricacies. Haarde, though, served as an economist in Iceland's central bank before becoming an adviser at the Ministry of Finance.</p> <p>Icelandic banks have provided long-term loans as well as working capital facilities to many retailers during the buyout frenzy fuelled by the consumer boom of the past decade. However, last week's state bail-out has left many businesses in limbo.</p> <p>Advisers said some retailers would have trouble accessing working capital, potentially having an effect on daily operations such as paying staff and suppliers. Mosaic has a \u00a375m revolving credit facility but insiders said it had already made use of this facility. However credit insurer Coface has already pulled cover on firms that supply Baugur leaving them exposed were it to default.</p> <p>Like other Icelandic firms Baugur could sell its stakes in listed retailers, a move that would crystallise already heavy paper losses due to bombed-out valuations in the sector. Unwinding its 13 per cent holding in Debenhams - which is held through derivatives - is likely to put further pressure on the department store group's share price, which is already down 60 per cent in the last year at 40.75p.</p> <p>Baugur is not the only Icelandic-backed investor thought to have problems. Insurer Exista has been a less prolific investor in UK but its purchase of JJB founder Dave Whelan's 29 per cent stake for \u00a3190m last summer has proved disastrous. Today the whole company is worth just \u00a343.6m after the shares collapsed on the back of poor trading and allegations it had breached its banking covenants. But Exista has far bigger problems on its hands - it is Kaupthing's largest shareholder. This week Exista has been raising funds by liquidating other investments and there is mounting speculation it could do the same with JJB.</p> <p>Warning signs are also flashing at little-known investment vehicle Arev, once dubbed the new Baugur. Run by former Baugur executive Jon Scheving Thorsteinsson it owns Jones the Bootmaker, leather goods brand Aspinal of London as well as stakes in Hardy Amies and fashion brand Ghost. Hardy Amies fell into administration on Friday while Ghost is seeking finance. Highlighting the complex web of relationships among Icelandic-backed firms is Ghost, which is co-owned by Stanford who co-owns fashion chain All Saints and some of its listed share holdings with Baugur. Stanford is thought to be facing substantial losses but could not be reached for comment.</p> <p>In just 10 days, Iceland's economy has been devastated. The reverberations are set to engulf the British high street.</p>",
  "<p>It seems that I, along with all the females in the country, should be thanking Jade Goody. But first maybe the British public should ask themselves - how real is our interest in her plight? Or is this just more 'grief porn' for the masses?</p> <p>Not so long ago, Goody was the ultimate Celebrity Untouchable, only useful to be occasionally ridiculed in photo spreads about bad shoes or sweat patches, or apologise yet again for bullying Bollywood actress Shilpa Shetty in the Big Brother house. A year or so on, Goody was still all but excommunicated from the world of celebrity; the standard reaction to her name would be a mewl of disgust. </p> <p>Odd then, even rather distasteful, that since the announcement of her aggressive cervical cancer, we suddenly can't get enough of her. Even odder, perhaps, that some appear to be blaming Goody for this. </p> <p>What does it say about British society that we have such a powerful mawkish streak? Nor does it take the death of an uber-icon such as Princess Diana to inspire it. Never mind the Queen of Hearts - this runs all the way through the celebrity alphabet from A list through to Z. Moreover, say what you like about the 'over-sentimental' Americans, but even they are more temperate in such matters.</p> <p>When Paul Newman died, there was certainly interest and grief in the US, but there wasn't the kind of eye-dabbing, nose-blowing weepathon of the kind you'd expect over here. It has long struck me that not only are the British ambulance chasers, but that we're not averse to waiting patiently at the depot for the ambulance to leave. At the risk of being facetious, there is almost an element of: 'Ooh, someone's really poorly; let's make a day of it.'</p> <p>Indeed, one wonders how former EastEnders Wendy Richards must be feeling about the media coverage of the return and spread of her cancer? Richards reacted in a no-nonsense manner by saying she was furious about its return and bringing forward her wedding to last Friday. One hopes the event was not marred by the grisly sense of media countdown that now dogs 'Battling' Wendy's every move.</p> <p>It has been suggested to me that celebrities such as Goody and Richards can often seem more real than the real people around you and this goes some way to explaining the exaggerated public reaction to their health problems. However, it also shames those who criticised Goody for going too public with her plight, to the point of giving paid interviews to publications such as OK! magazine.</p> <p>Are we seeing here the flipside to the British appetite for grief-porn? As in: it's all very well for the public to circle like vultures, and for the media to use it to shift product, but somehow d\u00e9class\u00e9 for Goody to be proactive? Its almost as if she should eschew such tacky behaviour and instead lie in state, awaiting her fate, like some 'Bermondsey Evita', all the more worshipped because she is quiet and still. Phooey to that, Goody evidently thought, and we should be grateful she did. </p> <p>The squeamish (and, yes, I do mean men) should maybe look away now for I must speak of 'down there'. Which brings me to why females should be thankful to Jade. How many of us sheepishly made a long overdue appointment for a smear test when we heard about what had happened to Goody? I did, scuttling to the GP the first chance I got. By the same token, how many people immediately stopped umming and aahing about the new cervical cancer vaccination for young girls and realised it was a great idea?</p> <p>This is what Jade has achieved with her horrible health luck, 'too public stance' and supposedly tacky OK! interviews - a heightened awareness of cervical cancer that has probably been more powerful than a 100 NHS campaigns combined. Similarly, Richards has underlined the need for vigilance even after you've got the all-clear.</p> <p>Indeed, if we feel the need to criticise, we should maybe take a look at that element of ourselves that likes to gawp. Not that this necessarily means we should stop. In a roundabout way, the part of us that reacts to Jade's story is probably the same part that sends money to charity appeals. </p> <p>In a nutshell, there is nothing bad, and plenty good, about the ability to feel empathy for a complete stranger - so long as we're aware that what is happening isn't an old soap plotline of Wendy's or a PR stunt of Jade's. So long as, just like what's happening to them, our sympathy is real.</p> <h2>Suffering from BSF? Don't worry - you're not alone</h2> <p>As if the credit crunch weren't tough enough, our house seems to have come down with Boxed-Set Fatigue (BSF). For the benefit of the uninitiated, BSF is what happens when you can't really afford to go out anymore, so you and your other half stay in and work your way through sundry boxed sets of 'comedy and popular drama', until suddenly, one night, sprawled in bed, bickering and slapping each other's hands away from the remote control, your bodies half-submerged in discarded discs, you realise you just can't take it anymore. </p> <p>With financial meltdown all around, you might think this is small beer, but ask any long-term couple - lack of synergy in such an area can be corrosive. I still bear the psychological scars of realising that The Sopranos boxed set I believed we were enjoying together had, in fact, been wolfed down secretly by my partner, resulting in him having to fake watching the series with me. Ditto, Curb Your Enthusiasm, where a bit more curbing and a lot less enthusiasm would have been nice. But those were our glory days, when we actually managed to finish the damn things. </p> <p>Where BSF is concerned, it turns out that men are weak, leastways not as strong as woman. A certain someone keeps collapsing into unconsciousness during, of all things, The Wire. Currently, it's taking us an average of three nights an episode. Sometimes he refuses to watch it at all and I'm forced to behave like some DVD version of sex starved Yootha Joyce in George and Mildred: 'Oh come on, just one episode!' </p> <p>On the bright side, maybe it's a zeitgeist thing, one of the hidden costs of the credit crunch: skint couples imploding under the strain of staying in to save money and ending up watching too many boxed sets together. In such circumstances, is it any wonder one ends up with compatibility buckling, differences emerging? All over the country, couples are locked in their own poignant Neil-Babs moment: 'You don't watch \"previously unseen footage\" with me anymore.' </p> <p>Alternatively, those couples afflicted with BSF could stop being so pathetic: defy the credit crunch, ditch the DVDs, and go out - to laugh, talk, who knows, perhaps even rediscover each other? But let's hope it won't come to that.</p> <h2>I've only got eyes for one tiger and it's not the one with whiskers</h2> <p>How selfless is Vladimir Putin in continuing to share his midlife crisis with us? The former Russian president is fast becoming the Charles Dance of international politics - forever inappropriately disrobing and looking 'virile' out of context. I may have to get a special corkboard to keep up with my ever-increasing stockpile of Vlad 'I've still got it!' Putin photos.</p> <p>While some might argue that the infamous topless hunting shots of Putin more than hit the spot, Vlad, a recent birthday boy, just keeps on giving. There was that fearless posing with one of his presents, a Siberian tiger cub. 'She eats meat,' Vlad explained. Intriguing. There is also a brand new DVD, entitled Let's Learn Judo With Vladimir Putin, in which he struts around in white judo jammies, throwing opponents to the floor and opining: 'The practice of struggle permits compromises and concessions. But they are possible only if they are on the road to victory.' Quite.</p> <p>I, for one, don't mind admitting it took many milliseconds to tear my eyes away from the sheer buffness of the man whose decisions regarding Chechnya and Georgia made Robert Mugabe fleetingly resemble the world's second least reasonable man. More seriously, while Putin displays all the signs of being as crazy as a cut snake, he makes our lot look like a sorry shower. What do our ex-premiers ever do with their post-power years except sit on vague-sounding international committees, or stick their snouts in the lecture circuit trough? By contrast, Putin is hurling about men half his age and rambling away gnomically, like Eric Cantona playing Colonel Kurtz in some judo-themed Apocalypse Now. You've got to admit he's different; one could even say special.</p> <p>But is this enough for Vlad? Putin will surely need another challenge and may disappear to go native in some dense jungle, with a knife between his teeth and a poem in his soul. We must enjoy him while we still can.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on October 26 2008. Vladimir Putin is the former President and current Prime Minister of Russia, not the 'former premier' as we said in the article above. This has been corrected. </p>",
  "<p>Leaving aside the constraints of the national curriculum, there seems no reason why our teachers should not double as spies. This dual function has been quite a tradition in British education, at undergraduate level at least. Admittedly, Cambridge dons who recruited, among others, some members of the Apostles, did not have to weigh up the impact of their work on literacy hour. But if the demands of espionage now leave teachers with less time for spelling, well, as Ed Balls demonstrates in his department's new spying manual, 'Learning Together to be Safe', this is no time for pedantry. 'Instead of rappers glamourising (sic) gun crime,' writes the chief of Department for Children, Schools and Families Centre, quoting an insightful young person from whom we can all learn, 'it is extremists glamourising (sic) terrorism'.</p> <p>So the case for surveillance is undeniable. With at least one British primary school pupil having apparently expressed admiration for the '7/7 martyrs', all schoolteachers should consider their own response in similar circumstances. Official advice is to invite the child to 'learn about emotional needs and consequences of actions'. Then, at the same time that they consider 'the need for involvement of external partners' (ie, calling the police), teachers might want to 'sensitively monitor continuing behaviours', presumably without alerting the child in question that he or she is being sensitively monitored. What Mr Balls's practical-sounding 'toolkit' neglects to mention is where teachers are meant to acquire the relevant tradecraft. Radicalisation is unlikely to be taking place within the school. Can straightforward teacher training be adequate preparation for the sort of extensive, yet clandestine operations that are indicated by 'Learning Together to be Safe'?</p> <p>Fortunately, where the basics of surveillance and covert communication are concerned, a lot can be learned from the novels of John le Carr\u00e9. When spying on a child Islamist it makes good sense, for example, for teachers not to hang around too obviously outside the house where indoctrination is occurring, like the useless pair of spooks in le Carr\u00e9's admirable new novel, A Most Wanted Man</p> <p>Should 'Learning Together to be Safe' prompt a heightened counter-espionage response from young extremists, the behaviour of Magnus Pym in le Carr\u00e9's A Perfect Spy is also worth a look, bearing in mind that Pym's precautions did not have to be fitted around weighing the obese, teaching happiness and instilling a sense of Britishness. Here we find him showing teachers how to establish that their SATs and government pamphlets have not been tampered with: 'Regaining his room he checked the papers on his desk. Stapler to handle of teacup. Book matches to pencil. Burnbox aligned to desk leg ...'</p> <p>At the same time, the story of charming, treacherous Pym serves as a warning, to Balls and his spies alike, that out of all the thousands of teachers in this country some are bound to be more loyal than others. Whom should they trust? Some benign-looking colleagues might simply be better at concealing their sympathies than the notional supply teacher whose case-study features in Balls's toolkit. Not all violent extremists will be silly enough to leave hate literature, advocating martyrdom, in the school library ('seek advice on the content via the police').</p> <p>Sidique Khan, for example, did not arouse any suspicion between 2001 and 2004 when he worked as a \u00a317,000-a-year 'learning mentor' at Hillside primary school in Leeds. On the contrary: the former headmistress of that school, Sarah Balfour, said: 'Sidique was a real asset to the school and always showed 100 per cent commitment.' So had anything like the toolkit existed at that time, there seems no reason to suppose that Khan - 'Sid', as he was affectionately known - would not have gone on to become the ringleader of the 7/7 terrorists who murdered 52 people in London in 2005, six of them killed by his own suicide bomb near Edgware Road tube station.</p> <p>Khan was 30, married and a father when he slaughtered fellow citizens: perhaps much younger, less sophisticated extremists will be easier to identify? Any clues? The toolkit is unable to be very specific. 'The key conclusion from available evidence is that there is no single profile of a person likely to become involved in extremism,' it vouchsafes. None the less, teachers are invited to note that unemployment is one of several factors that might 'translate to a generalised rejection of civic life'.</p> <p>That these particular unemployed people will not be at school any more must not, of course, deter teachers from looking out for pupils who might feel this way if and when they do find themselves without work. The price of freedom, and all that. And did not the DG of the security services recently mention children, 'as young as 15 or 16 implicated in terrorist-related activity'? Sooner or later one of these junior extremists is sure to betray him or herself at circle time. After which it is simply a question of expert surveillance.</p> <p>No doubt teachers can feel confident that, in the event of a violent extremist being identified somewhere in or around a school, the individual in question will be more scrupulously monitored than were two of the 7/7 bombers, after the police observed their contacts with the gang plotting to blow up fertiliser bombs. And then focused their attention elsewhere, since limited resources did not allow them to monitor every extremist who might be avoiding surveillance, attending militaristic training camps and discussing jihad on the telephone.</p> <p>Maybe it's just as well, in these straitened circumstances, that teachers are so unlikely to identify, or discourage (through enlightened class debate), any of the embryonic terrorists who might now be in their classrooms. Individual extremists are unlikely, according to psychologists who have studied suicide bombers, to reveal themselves as notably strange or unbalanced. A contemporary remembered the teenaged Sidique Khan as 'friends with the in crowd'. Moreover, as described by former members of extreme, Islamist organisations, radicalisation usually happens once teenagers have left school, when they join small groups at college, in community centres, or around mosques, often replacing their own families' religious practices and, even, the legacy of their anti-bullying projects, with a new creed that, as Shiraz Maher has said, 'provides \"an ideological infrastructure cheering them on\"'.</p> <p>Still, even if violent extremism is likely to elude them, there are plenty of other challenges for Britain's infinitely resourceful teachers. If their job description can be extended, as the toolkit proposes, to encompass espionage, at the same time that they instil in children the importance of 'mutual respect and understanding', the criminality of violence, and primacy of 'staying safe', Balls's task force could surely be persuaded to stamp out knife crime and build what he calls 'more cohesive and resilient communities', perhaps by dismantling faith schools? And once the teachers have created this heaven on earth, they can teach us all to spell.</p>",
  "<p>In an unprecedented outpouring of anger, 42 of the UK\u2019s most celebrated writers will each publish a short story, essay or poem tomorrow attacking the government\u2019s determination to proceed with legislation to hold terrorist suspects without charge for 42 days. The list of writers taking part reads like a literary \u2018Who\u2019s Who\u2019 of modern Britain. They include Philip Pullman, Julian Barnes, Monica Ali, Ian Rankin, Alain de Botton, Ali Smith and AL Kennedy.</p> <p>The writers\u2019 decision to speak out comes on the eve of a House of Lords vote on the legislation tomorrow night. The government managed to push the legislation through the Commons in June by only nine votes - secured with support from the Democratic Unionist Party. But it is widely believed that the government would lose a subsequent vote on the bill if it were rejected by the Lords and returned to the Commons for further amendments, as a number of Labour backbenchers have recently withdrawn their support.</p> <p>Both Gordon Brown and the Home Secretary, Jacqui Smith, strongly support the measure, and there was little sign of the government backing down this weekend. \u2018We are resolute in our determination to put our arguments to the Lords and we are hoping they will listen,\u2019 said a source close to Smith.</p> <p>But what has until now largely been a political row is fast becoming a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre for Britain\u2019s literary establishment, who are flexing their intellectual muscles in a manner not seen since leading figures in the arts world regularly clashed with the Thatcher government in the Eighties.</p> <p>Pullman, the author of the trilogy His Dark Materials, uses his essay to launch a sarcastic diatribe against the government. \u2018We don\u2019t know how lucky we are to live in a nation where police officers have all of six weeks to discover why they\u2019ve locked us up,\u2019 Pullman writes. \u2018Ask them after 41 days why a prisoner is still behind bars and they can honestly and innocently say, \u201cNo idea, mate.\u201d But give them that extra day, and they\u2019ll crack it.\u2019</p> <p>Kennedy, the winner of the Costa Book of the Year Award, argues that the legislation will transform every suspect\u2019s life for the worse. \u2018In 42 days we will have made you different,\u2019 she writes. \u2018You may be charged, you may be released. You will always be different.\u2019</p> <p>And Barnes, who has been shortlisted three times for the Man Booker Prize, writes of the urgent necessity to reject the legislation. \u2018Claiming to defend British liberty by diminishing British liberty has become a political norm over the last 30 years or so,\u2019 he claims. \u2018Digging in the heels and shouting is now more important than ever.\u2019</p> <p>The highly public attack on the government, co-ordinated by the campaign group Liberty, will crystallise the long-running debate surrounding detention without trial. \u2018It is so heartening to see Britain\u2019s finest writers joining Liberty\u2019s campaign against extending detention without charge,\u2019 said Shami Chakrabarti, director of Liberty. \u2018Not a single writer that was approached turned down the opportunity to register their opposition to this divisive policy. Tomorrow the House of Lords will speak and we urge the government to listen.\u2019</p> <p>Crossbenchers including Baron Dear, a former Inspector of Constabulary, and Lady Manningham-Buller, former head of MI5, have already expressed their opposition to any extension beyond the current 28 days.</p> <p>A number of high-ranking police officers, including Andy Hayman, the Met\u2019s former head of counter-terrorism, and Sir Ken Macdonald, Director of Public Prosecutions, have also attacked the plan, while international figures such as Noam Chomsky and Desmond Tutu have voiced their concerns.</p> <p>Opposition parties have attacked the bill, which the government claims is necessary to give police sufficient time to investigate complex and often international terror plots.</p> <p>\u2018These proposals are unnecessary, unjustified and unworkable, as well as counter-productive, and now a distraction when the world is facing an economic crisis,\u2019 said the shadow home secretary, Dominic Grieve.</p> <p>Chris Huhne, the Liberal Democrats\u2019 home affairs spokesman, said: \u2018The government managed to bully and bribe this legislation through the Commons, but fortunately it has much less leverage over the Lords. I hope they will do their worst.\u2019</p> <h2>The 42 who put pen to paper</h2> <p>Monica Ali<br>Yasmin Alibhai-Brown<br>Tahmima Anam<br>Lisa Appignanesi<br>Nadeem Aslam<br>Julian Barnes<br>John Berger<br>Terence Blacker<br>Alain de Botton<br>Shami Chakrabarti<br>Jenny Diski<br>Anne Donovan<br>Stella Duffy<br>Joe Dunthorne<br>Bernardine Evaristo<br>Michael Faber<br>Esther Freud<br>Linda Grant<br>Jay Griffiths<br>Mohsin Hamid<br>Tom Hodgkinson<br>Maria Hyland<br>Sadie Jones<br>Jackie Kay<br>AL Kennedy<br>Hari Kunzru<br>Nick Laird<br>Nikita Lalwani<br>Darian Leader<br>Ann Leslie<br>Toby Litt<br>Alexander Masters<br>Hisham Matar<br>Daljit Nagra<br>Rachel North<br>Andrew O\u2019Hagan<br>Philip Pullman<br>Ian Rankin<br>Kamila Shamsie<br>Hardeep Singh Kohli<br>Ali Smith<br>Craig Taylor<br>Sally Vickers</p>",
  "<p>To paraphrase an old Airplane joke: 'Oh my God, there's something wrong with the library!' 'What is it?' 'It's a big building with books in it. But that's not important right now.'</p> <p>This joke only works if a library is a big building with books in it. And that is a definition which Andy Burnham, Secretary of State for Culture, would hate to hear. A modern library is - or should be - a big place with computers, snacks, drinks, music, small talk and possibly a rugby pitch in it. Fun and games! Noise and chatter! Meeting and greeting! Cakes and ale!</p> <p>My borough, Camden in north London, will be the test case in a new scheme to allow mobile phones, food and drink into libraries and provide computer games.</p> <p>This is reassuring news, as I didn't actually realise that we had any libraries left in Camden. I thought I'd been to a protest fete over the closure of every last one. Any time I've visited a library in the last 10 years, I've found Jude Law, Rachel Weisz and Bill Nighy holding hands in a ring round the building, singing: 'We shall not be moved'.</p> <p>So I am pleased to hear that we've still got some. But my brain is struggling with the philosophical question (like that of the tree falling in the empty forest): if there is nothing inside but people eating burgers and playing the Sims, is it actually a library? Isn't it just an internet cafe?</p> <p>In 2006, David Lammy, then Culture Minister, announced: 'Books are fundamentally important to what libraries are about.'</p> <p>You might think this does not need to be said. You might think it's like saying: 'A fundamental thing about shoes is that they are worn on the feet.'</p> <p>But, oh, how we need the clear vision of Lammy (a man who grew up in a house 'where you could count the books on two hands', but graduated with a SOAS law degree and a masters from Harvard, so probably understands why the local library should offer more than cheese sandwiches and Nintendo), after a week when Andy Burnham insisted that libraries must 'look beyond the bookcase'.</p> <p>Why? Why must they? They're libraries. The bookcase is exactly where they should be looking. For God's sake, someone should be. I can eat and make phone calls at home.</p> <p>Any service provider wants customers, just like anyone throwing a party wants guests. If nobody shows up but Aunt Maud and the barman, you feel a bit miserable. But where does it end for the library which believes that books don't get bums on seats? They could put a doner in the window and be full every night. They could sell cars. They could have Peter Andr\u00e9 performing weekly. But then it wouldn't be a library and what would be good about anyone going in?</p> <p>It's like a GP saying: 'These MMR injections are excellent, safe and beneficial to society. But they don't seem very popular. So, in my surgery, I define an MMR injection as \"a free jam sponge\". They're going like hot cakes! Everyone's coming in for them! My community is now 100 per cent MMR-vaccinated. Unfortunately, they all have measles.'</p> <p>Let's say, for the sake of argument, that too few people these days are attracted by libraries. There's Amazon, there's the internet. Libraries have dropped off the radar. Maybe people haven't experienced, or can't imagine, the joy of wandering round the shelves, gathering a great pile of books on whatever you happen to be interested in - books you'd never think to buy, full of information you'd never think to look up online - and settling at a table in a space which is quiet and thoughtful, but full of other people. People you can gaze at and wonder why on earth they're reading The Underwater Acoustics Handbook. People to smile at flirtatiously over the spine of Across Europe by Kangaroo</p> <p>Surely the answer is to remind the world what a lovely way this is to spend an afternoon? Teach the delights of random reading? Show children that each book is a tiny new adventure? Not just ruefully accept that they don't realise this already, and give them computer games instead. I admire Andy Burnham for understanding that libraries should be at the heart of the community. I'm glad he's trying to fill them up, remove any 'intimidating' stigma, throw in a bit of internet access, try to find a social angle, make them more welcoming. </p> <p>But I'm terrified that he's trying to achieve this by changing libraries into branches of McDonald's. First principle: make people want books. Help them to be so captivated by a story that they can stop eating and texting for five goddamn minutes. Then: put more books in libraries.</p> <p>Burnham says that more library funding would 'not be realistic in the current climate'. Cobblers. In 'the current climate', people need, more than ever, to know about the world. To think laterally and have ideas. To develop an internal life, as an alternative to clubbing and jet-setting. To study history and learn how we've got out of trouble before.</p> <p>The man who thinks that books are a luxury to be cut back in times of recession is a man who doesn't understand that knowledge is the key to everything and must be at the centre of everything.</p> <p>If I were in charge of libraries, and weren't terrified of upsetting my government colleagues or baffling an electorate which has yet to be inspired, I'd spend a few million on books and stuff them into new libraries made out of old branches of Northern Rock. Personally (and I speak as someone whose shares are worthless, whose pension fund has withered and whose remaining savings may well disappear overnight), I'm not too scared about the collapse of Western civilisation. I reckon we'd be in great shape to build a new and better world from scratch - as long as we had a lot of allotments and a lot of libraries.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.victoriacoren.com\">victoriacoren.com</a></p>",
  "<p>It was 19 minutes to noon on Wednesday when Gordon Brown took the call from Mervyn King. With the seconds ticking away to the Prime Minister's first Question Time in the Commons since the summer break, the governor of the Bank of England had dramatic news: secret consultations between the world's most powerful central bankers had resulted in the decision to make the biggest co-ordinated cut in interest rates there had ever been.</p> <p>With the world's financial system perilously close to complete meltdown, bankers were determined to show they meant business. The move was to be announced at midday in London and 7am New York time, and King was nervous that Brown might be embarrassed by a backbencher picking up the news via BlackBerry as he stood up to speak.</p> <p>Brown had already been dealing with the financial crisis for more than six hours that morning, having held a 5am summit with Chancellor Alistair Darling at Number 11 to discuss details of a \u00a350bn part-nationalisation of Britain's bombed-out banks, due to be unveiled to the stock exchange that morning.</p> <p>With just 10 minutes to go before world markets heard the news, King's next call was to Darling. Both Prime Minister and Chancellor had been hoping for a rate cut for many weeks as the credit crisis began to take its toll on Britain's cash-strapped borrowers, threatening to tip the economy into a severe recession.</p> <p>Just before Brown stood up to explain his drastic bail-out plan to Parliament, US Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson was appearing before reporters in Washington in an attempt to reassure American voters that their savings were safe. Asked if he planned to emulate Brown's bail-out package, Paulson was sniffy, defending his own $700bn 'troubled asset recovery plan'. Yet within little more than 48 hours, he was signing up to a promise by the G7 finance ministers to pour public cash into struggling banks, buying shares to ease the severe shortage of capital in the world's financial sector.</p> <p>The reason for the volte-face was simple: Wall Street was locked into a vertiginous sell-off as terrified investors dumped stocks, commodities and the dollar, fearing that the mounting financial crisis would turn into a full-blown economic slump.</p> <p>By the time the G7 finance ministers gathered in Washington on Friday afternoon, there was no doubt whatever that they were looking at disaster. The half-point rate cut, unthinkable just a few days before, was greeted with a shrug by investors who had lost their faith in governments' powers to fix the world economy. Wall Street had suffered the worst week in its history, with the Dow Jones index losing an extraordinary 18 per cent of its value, and every major stock market had plunged, day after day. On Friday alone, the Dow hurtled an eye-watering 700 points downwards, then swung up into positive territory, before settling 'only' 128 points down.</p> <p>General Motors, once the proud symbol of America's car industry, was worth less by the end of the week than it was in 1929, and felt obliged to issue a statement saying it was not at risk of bankruptcy. By Saturday, it had announced talks about a merger with its rival Chrysler. Morgan Stanley was in desperate talks to save a proposed cash injection from the Japanese bank Mitsubishi, and on Wall Street the buzz was that Paulson's damascene conversion to state intervention had been triggered by the impending demise of another household name of US banking.</p> <p>Thousands of miles away in Iceland, once a sleepy but prosperous example of the cautious Nordic economic model, a decade of financial excess was ending in tears. Reykjavik has been brought to the edge of national bankruptcy by its overstretched financial firms, and deposits from thousands of British savers, along with money belonging to local authorities and charities, was tied up in Icelandic banks. An IMF team was dispatched to assess its need for an emergency loan. Reports in Washington suggested that other countries were also teetering on the brink of insolvency.</p> <p>G7 ministers were keen to avoid the policy paralysis that had been so evident when Nicolas Sarkozy gathered the leaders of Europe's big four economies in Paris a week earlier. Then, declarations of solidarity were swiftly belied by Germany's unilateral decision to guarantee all bank deposits, an example of the beggar-my-neighbour behaviour that had helped to deepen the Great Depression. The world's financial markets had delivered a clear message about the costs of indecision and disarray.</p> <p>The strain of wrestling with the crisis was clearly visible on the faces of the finance ministers. France's Christine Lagarde, Washington's Hank Paulson and Alistair Darling all looked as if they had been burning the midnight oil - which they had. It didn't help that on Saturday, they all had to be at the White House by 6.45am to get security clearance for their breakfast meeting with George Bush.</p> <p>The President has repeated his mantra that if they work together, the West's biggest economies would get through the crisis. For the first time since the turmoil entered a new and dangerous phase, Bush's remarks did not send share prices tumbling - but only because the market was closed for the weekend.</p> <p>Darling's morning continued with a bilateral with Paulson, and talks with the new chairman of the Financial Services Authority, Lord Turner, over the plans for recapitalising some of Britain's biggest banks, details of which will be announced tomorrow.</p> <p>Around the table at the US Treasury, Darling argued forcefully that recapitalising banks with public cash was the only viable solution to the worldwide crisis. Japanese delegates, rarely the most vehement contributors to G7 debates, argued passionately that the lesson from their country's own catastrophic banking crisis in the 1990s was that taxpayer-backed bail-outs of financial institutions should be carried out without delay. So keen was King to push home the importance of unblocking the credit markets, he summoned up the ghost of Elvis Presley, saying, 'as the King would say - a little less conversation, a little more action'.</p> <p>It was not Elvis but the desperate need to restore calm to the markets that really prodded the G7 into action, however. When civil servants presented a first draft of the communiqu\u00e9, several pages long and packed with waffle, finance ministers said they wouldn't sign it - because it wouldn't work.</p> <p>Italian finance minister Giulio Tremonti even went public, saying 'the current draft is too weak', and wouldn't, at first, put his name to anything more than a page long. When the meeting ended, what emerged was a five-point plan, including a promise to buy up stakes in banks, on the British model.</p> <p>Governments also pledged to prevent the failure of 'systemically important' banks, in a bid to avoid unleashing another financial domino effect like the one that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers; take 'all necessary steps to unfreeze credit and money markets'; ensure that consumers around the world can have confidence in the safety of their savings; and take action to kick-start stalled markets in the mortgage-backed assets and other securities that banks use to help fund their lending.</p> <p>In other words, governments of the world's richest countries will unleash every weapon they have, including billions of pounds of taxpayers' money, to rebuild the global banking system and reopen the flow of credit to consumers and households. Paulson called it 'aggressive,' but that was an understatement - it is financial 'shock and awe'.</p> <p>There are high hopes in Washington that this much concentrated firepower, perhaps combined with more drastic rate cuts from central banks, must eventually work - though European Central Bank governor Jean-Claude Trichet said it might still take time for the markets to respond positively. If this plan does succeed, finance ministers can stop worrying about the risk of total collapse of the world's financial system - and start worrying about the long, grinding recession that most believe will follow this month of extraordinary drama.</p> <p>When Paulson was drafted into Washington from Goldman Sachs in 2006, with his action man demeanour and impeccable Wall Street pedigree he seemed the ideal personification of America's economic invincibility. Two years on, he, and the swashbuckling model of capitalism he represents look like a busted flush. Even even his friends on Wall Street have dramatically lost faith in his power to halt the financial storm.</p> <p>For 50 years, America has been the global economy's uncontested superpower, preaching open markets, financial liberalisation and free trade. Washington confidently believed it had the answer to the world's economic problems, if only the unconverted would listen. But last week showed that the US has no magic recipe to assuage the violent fear that had seized Wall Street, let alone offer a blueprint for other governments to follow.</p> <p>Every time delegates from developing countries thumbed through a newspaper, or glanced at a TV screen, they saw bleak red graphs of plunging stock markets or footage of an earnest-looking Bush using an emergency briefing in the White House rose garden to reassure shell-shocked American voters.</p> <p>The US public are bailing out of mutual funds in their droves and discussing where the hard-earned cash they have saved for retirement or their kids' college funds will be least at risk. Safe-makers are reporting rising sales as a growing number of Americans resort to the old-fashioned method of withdrawing their dollars and locking them up at home.</p> <p>At every press conference within the tight ring of security that surrounds the IMF's HQ, a forest of hands shot up, as journalists from Brazil, the Philippines, Russia, China and a host of other countries asked urgently what impact the crisis would have on their home countries.</p> <p>For the past decade, World Bank and IMF meetings have been dominated by the problems of the world's poorest countries. The crash of 2008 has followed the longest sustained boom in the global economy since the late 1960s and early 1970s, breeding the complacent belief that the only real issue was how to help poverty-stricken countries in Africa catch up. This year, the mood had changed: Africa barely merited a mention, as the West concentrated exclusively on preventing its home-grown crisis dragging the entire world into a slump.</p> <p>The problem is twofold: in the short term, the vital need is to stop the financial virus from infecting every country in the world and having an even bigger impact on global growth. In the longer term it is how to rebuild a world financial system that has so comprehensively failed in the past 14 months.</p> <p>In 12 months' time, when the IMF gathers for its next annual meeting in Istanbul, the world may look very different. There is a palpable sense in Washington that even if the downturn is shorter and sharper than the IMF predicts, the domino effect that began in America's housing market and has rippled throughout the world, is leaving in its wake a powerful momentum for reform.</p> <p>Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the IMF's managing director, stressed that there must be no return to 'business as usual' when the worst of the crisis is over. At the very least, there will be reforms to what the experts call the 'global financial architecture' - in other words, the rules will be tightened.</p> <p>Credit ratings agencies, which assess how likely borrowers are to repay their debts, will find their activities reined in; regulators monitoring the behaviour of international banks across different jurisdictions will be forced to work more closely together; and the IMF is likely to be given stronger powers to issue warnings about the build-up of dangerous financial bubbles in the years ahead.</p> <p>Central bankers who have contented themselves for the past decade with focusing on inflation, may well also be asked to take into account the risk that by cutting interest rates to keep economies out of recession they may be pumping up an unsustainable boom. Alan Greenspan, the former US Federal Reserve chairman, was once lionised as an economic 'maestro', but now appears to be a major architect of the crisis. The IMF said the world economy had been allowed to run above its 'speed limit' for too long.</p> <p>The banks, which have been forced to beg for public cash to prevent their business model imploding, will find themselves under severe scrutiny from their new shareholder, the taxpayer. In return for rescuing them, governments will insist on limits on bonus payouts and curbs on dividends to shareholders.</p> <p>There are broader changes afoot, too. Robert Zoellick, president of the World Bank and a veteran of the US Treasury, called for seven major emerging economies to join the traditional G7 club of rich countries to provide a better reflection of the new power balance in the world economy. Bringing Brazil, China, India, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia and South Africa on board would create a powerful 'steering group,' representing 70 per cent of the world's GDP and 56 per cent of its population.

  "<p>Jersey, 20 June 1940, and my seven-year-old childhood was about to turn upside down. Dad had queued for hours to get passes for us to board a boat, any boat, as the German army was only a few miles across the sea in Normandy. My family and I joined the crowds at the harbour and were soon packed on the deck of a Dutch coal boat. Most of us were crying as we set sail and waved goodbye to the relatives still undecided on what to do. As darkness fell, the crew erected a tarpaulin over their unusual cargo, but the sea was calm, so we children managed to sleep for a few hours. We were awakened by loud explosions - thinking we were being bombed, we cried out in panic, but the bangs were our boat firing its gun at enemy aircraft. As day dawned our tarpaulin was rolled away, and to our joy we could see the English coast. We felt safe. Two jovial bearded sailors appeared carrying enamel pails of tea and coffee. One called out jokingly: 'Dip in, pigs!' My mother excused them: 'They are foreign and don't understand what they're saying.' We docked in Weymouth, where we washed the coal dust from our tear-stained faces. We didn't realise it would be five long years before we made the return trip home.</p> <p>\u2022 Do you have a memorable journey?

  "<p>The coastal village of Durness lies on the north-west tip of Scotland, in one of the least populated parts of western Europe. The landscape is one of savage beauty, with strange black rocks jutting out of the white sand beaches of Sango Bay like gigantic rotten teeth biting the leaden sky. Overlooking the beach stands a sturdy white croft with a blue plaque that reads: 'John Lennon 1940-1980, Musician &amp; Songwriter, lived here.' </p> <p>It may seem a surprising claim - Lennon is most closely associated with Liverpool and New York - but from the age of nine to 14 he spent some of the happiest times of his life in this remote part of the Highlands when his family visited Durness on holiday. </p> <p>It was an association that began when Lennon's maternal aunt remarried. Her new husband, a dentist named Bertie Sutherland, owned a house in the village. The young Lennon would visit his Scottish relatives with his cousin Stan Parkes, who today lives along the coast from Glasgow and vividly recalls those childhood holidays. </p> <p>'John just loved the wildness and the openness of the place,' he said. 'We went fishing and hunting and John loved going up into the hills to draw or write poetry. John really loved hill walking, shooting and fishing. He used to catch salmon. He would have been quite a laird.'</p> <p>In Durness today there are people who still remember the young Lennon. Donald Campbell is an extravagantly mustachioed man with snow-white whiskers. He stands outside the conservatory of his home and points to the neighbouring croft. 'That was the house Lennon would visit,' he said. 'I remember young John running out of those gates and all of us boys racing to the beach ... just standing here brings back memories of short trousers and grazed knees.'</p> <p>It is not hard to see why Durness, the most north-westerly village on mainland Britain, would have appealed to someone brought up in Liverpool. 'There was complete freedom,' said Campbell. 'Us boys could just run around the village talking to strangers and playing by the beach and it was completely safe.' John, Stan and Donald would go fishing from the rocks, with 20ft poles and coloured feathers on the hooks. They would dip them into the sea where dozens of tiny fish began tugging at the lines.</p> <p>Iris MacKay, who runs the village store, played with the boys in the early Fifties. In those days her parents ran the store. 'I remember John liked playing practical tricks,' she said. 'He loved picking up seaweed from the sea and tying it to the doors outside this store so that we couldn't get out.' She said she regrets not having talked to him more when he was younger, 'but I wasn't to know what would become of him'. </p> <p>The memory of those boyhood holidays proved potent for Lennon. Some locals claim that the song 'In My Life' was partly inspired by his time in Durness. It is an indication of how important Durness was to Lennon that in 1969 the Beatle returned to the village, bringing with him Yoko Ono and their children Julian and Kyoko.</p> <p>Alistair Morrison, who was born in Durness and has spent all his life in the village, recalls Lennon turning up in his living room. 'I remember playing with John and his cousins when we were young boys,' he said, 'and then years later he came back and sat in this very room with his wife and the kids.'</p> <p>Morrison said that Lennon loved Durness because even in 1969, when he was a member of the most famous band in the world, he was allowed to be a normal person there. 'The people remembered him from when he was little,' he said, 'so he felt comfortable. But I have to admit it was still overwhelming for me to have a Beatle in my living room.'</p> <p>Lennon's visit with Ono turned out to be an ill-fated trip and had to be cut short after he crashed his car and was taken to hospital. 'John had a chauffeur-driven Rolls, a Ferrari and a Porsche, but he turned up in Durness in an old Maxi,' recalled Stan Parkes, 'but he was a terrible driver with bad eyesight.'</p> <p>Lennon was driving in dire weather when he caught sight of a foreign tourist driving towards him. He panicked and crashed the Maxi into the side of the road. He spent five days in hospital and both he and Ono needed stitches for facial injuries. </p> <p>It was to be the last time that Lennon visited Durness. And yet Durness and the Highlands maintained their pull on him. 'John used to say that he felt more Scottish than English,' said Philip Norman, author of an acclaimed new biography, John Lennon: The Life. 'He was always calling himself Jock and Whistling Jock Lennon, and even when he was living in New York he was always searching for a house that would remind him of the croft where he spent his childhood.' </p> <p>It never happened, and Lennon eventually moved into the Dakota building where he lived until he was murdered by Mark Chapman in 1980. </p> <p>Lennon would have turned 68 last week and in Durness a special concert was held last night to raise funds for the maintenance of a memorial dedicated to him. The concert followed a special festival celebrating Lennon's music. </p> <p>For today's visitors to Durness the memorial garden is an essential pilgrimage. It overlooks the beach where Lennon played as a boy and at its centre are three slabs of granite into which are etched some lines from 'In My Life', Lennon's wistful and affectionate tribute to the 'people and things that went before'. He never forgot Durness and, despite the distance and the years, the village has not forgotten him.</p> <p>\u2022 'John Lennon's Private Passion', written and presented by Sarfraz Manzoor, is on Radio 4 today at 2.45pm</p>",
  "<p>It was a week when confidence in shares, markets and capitalism itself was shaken to the core as stock prices fell more sharply than at any time since the Great Depression. </p> <p>'Utter carnage' is how one trader described events as he caught the train home from Canary Wharf on Friday. More than \u00a3600bn has been wiped from the value of shares of companies listed on the FTSE 100 since it climbed to 6,732 on 15 June 2007.</p> <p>Now the index is trading at around 4,000, a 40 per cent slump in 12 months, with about half of that recorded since the first week of September. That will have a big impact on the value of pensions. In the City, Mark Otswald, an analyst at Monument Securities, describes the last few days as 'sheer, bloody panic. The Western financial system is breaking down.'</p> <p>Apocalypse now? 'Let's hope not,' says Gerard Lyons, chief economist at Standard Chartered bank who believes that an economic catastrophe can be averted and confidence restored. 'But the authorities need to take swift, decisive action if we are to avoid a sharp, global recession.'</p> <p>The frightening thing is that markets continued to fall after rescue packages were unveiled, first in the US and then this week in the UK. </p> <p>The view from experts is that the shares sell-off reflects the belief that a global slump cannot be avoided, whatever individual governments might do. Ben Read at the Centre for Economic and Business Research says global, co-ordinated action from the authorities is urgent, and on a much larger scale than hitherto. 'At the moment, the mood is unforgiving and the herd mentality is kicking in,' he says. 'People are selling shares to raise cash because no one believes that anything is fairly valued. And they don't know how bad things are going to get, so the temptation is to dump assets, no matter what.'</p> <p>Economists broadly welcomed the British government's bailout plan announced earlier this week, which could be a template for other countries, including the US. 'Part of the reason behind the sell-off in Wall Street is that investors don't believe that Congress's $700bn rescue package is sufficient,' says Read. 'But it will take time for any counter-measure, even the British one, to work through the system.'</p> <p>On one level, it seems that whatever the authorities do simply isn't enough. The first priority is to free up the money markets where banks lend to each other to ensure there is sufficient credit around to lend to businesses and mortgage borrowers. Ominously, that isn't happening, and the inter-bank lending rate is still several points above the base rate. Where banks are lending to corporate customers, it comes at a price, with many firms preferring to put expansion plans on hold. </p> <p>David Frost, director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, says: 'The big issues for us are the cost of borrowing, the fact that banks are asking for more collateral before they agree to lend, and the length of time it is taking for loans to be approved. Companies are being squeezed and capital expenditure will be cut.' </p> <p>Russell Griggs, chairman of the CBI's Small and Medium Enterprise Council, is even more downbeat: 'The majority of companies are saying it's challenging or impossible to get credit,' he says. Last week, the council met for the first time since August: 'The level of concern has risen considerably since then.' </p> <p>Many businesses are already low on cash because of higher costs - such as fuel bills - and weakening consumer demand. But banks have almost stopped making loans to companies, particularly start-ups or those looking to expand. Steve Sharratt, SME vice-chairman, says: 'The really scary thing is that banks have shut up shop.'</p> <p>In addition, firms report that banks are asking for the renegotiation of some existing loans. Sharratt says one company with a turnover of \u00a31.5m went bust this month after its bank reduced its overdraft from \u00a3300,000 to \u00a325,000, giving it 10 days' notice. The bank also charged \u00a335,000 in fees. Derek Simpson, general secretary of the Unite union, says: 'The banks are trying to hoard cash and squeezing everyone down the chain.'</p> <p>But many other factors are affecting the markets. The expiry of the ban on short-selling has surely exacerbated the turmoil. Also, retail investors are dumping equities in favour of cash. In September, there was a net outflow of $72bn from American mutual funds, and the figure for this month could be even higher. </p> <p>In Britain, retail investors have held their nerve, although there was a \u00a3500m outflow in August. But hedge funds are major sellers. That is happening for one of two reasons: either because banks are making margin calls, where they ask for more security as debt becomes dearer to service, or because investors are taking fright and cashing in their chips.</p> <p>One industry executive says: 'Hedge funds are being flooded by calls from stakeholders looking to redeem their holdings. I think quite a few are going to struggle to survive.'</p> <p>Rich individuals, including Russian oligarchs, are also selling, in particular where loans are secured against equity stakes in companies under their control. As stock prices fall, banks are demanding more security from tycoons, many of whom have tied up their wealth in shares. </p> <p>Ukrainian oligarch and iron ore miner Kostyantin Zhevago was forced to sell a 20 per cent stake in metal company Ferrexpo last week because of the steep fall in the price of commodities. Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska has sold 20 per cent of Canadian car parts maker Magna and is 'relinquishing' his 10 per cent stake in Hochtief, the German construction group.</p> <p>Roman Abramovich, owner of Chelsea football club, is reported to have lost \u00a312bn in companies listed on the Moscow stockmarket. Arsenal stakeholder Alisher Usmanov has also lost money, sparking rumours that he could offload his shares in the north London club, although he has denied this in the past.</p> <p>When the world's wealthy elites are forced to sell shares, it not only adds to the downward pressure on financial markets, but also takes spending power out of the economy, with spin-off effects for sectors as diverse as luxury goods, property and investment in jobs. </p> <p>The Depression of 80 years ago was compounded by the fact that wealth was controlled by an even narrower spectrum of society than today; the effect of wealth destruction for a few was felt disproportionately by the rest of the population. Nevertheless, a version of that nexus exists today.</p> <p>As Friday drew to a close in the worst week on the stock markets in most living memories, worries were turning to insurers, some of whom made big investments in mortgage-backed securities. Insurance companies are also holders of stocks and bonds in financial firms that have been wiped out or damaged by the crisis. </p> <p>In the US, Prudential Financial has already warned that its quarterly profits would miss forecasts. Its rivals have seen their share prices hammered on concerns that they will need to raise capital. </p> <p>So far, in Britain, the insurance companies have escaped relatively unscathed, and fears that they might have to sell shares to increase their solvency ratios to make good a decline in equity prices appear overdone. </p> <p>In 2001-02, British insurers such as Standard Life were forced to sell equities to meet capital adequacy requirements, but today insurers are less vulnerable. That is because, over the years, they have cut their exposure to shares from around 70 per cent of their portfolio to 40 per cent or less, in favour of bonds and other assets. Last week, Aviva, owner of Norwich Union, said it had more than sufficient surplus regulatory capital. Nevertheless, rumours abound that some players have been trimming their shareholdings as the gloom continues.</p> <p>Of more concern are the potential liabilities hanging over credit default swaps, a huge unregulated sector that few people know about or understand. Over the last 12 years, the value of the CDS market, where these contracts are traded like other derivatives, has grown to $55 trillion. CDSs have been used to insure risky mortgage bonds, as well as the debt of collapsed institutions such as Lehman Brothers. The worry is that insurers and banks that underwrote these instruments will not be able to meet their liabilities.</p> <p>With judgement, and perhaps a little luck, the financial crisis that has enveloped the world can be brought under control via a global rescue plan, but the aftershock will almost certainly be with us for years to come.</p>",
  "<p>You want losers? How long have you got? How about<strong> Lakshmi Mittal</strong>, Britain's wealthiest non-dom and Labour party contributor, who has seen at least \u00a320bn wiped off his fortune through losses on his investment in RAB Capital and the collapse in the share price of his steel firm, ArcelorMittal?</p> <p><strong>Joe Lewis</strong>, Hackney-born currency speculator now based in the Caribbean, lost \u00a3500m through investments in doomed US bank Bear Stearns. It's likely his Irish mates, <strong>JP McManus</strong> and <strong>John Magnier</strong>, were also in on that deal. Still, Lewis turned up last week as the new 29 per cent shareholder in pub group M&amp;B, buying the stake at a knock-down price from poor old <strong>Robert Tchenguiz</strong>, down an estimated \u00a3800m as a victim of the Kaupthing collapse.</p> <p><strong>Michael Spencer</strong>, Tory party Treasury and founder of inter-dealer broker, Icap, has seen \u00a3500m wiped off his worth, but still has a positive balance of \u00a3500m and reckons the worst is behind us.

Last year, he went toe-to-toe with Fred Goodwin, Royal Bank of Scotland's under-pressure boss, in a bidding war for Dutch bank ABN Amro. Varley refused to match RBS's \u00a349bn offer and suggested Goodwin overpaid. RBS hit back: 'Barclays is trying to say that losing is the new winning, but it is just bollocks,' said a source there. Who's talking 'bollocks' now? </p> <p><strong>Norway</strong> has emerged from the international financial crisis relatively unscathed. Virtually every country cut interest rates last week, but not Norway and billionaires are now stuffing their fortunes into Norwegian banks. Unlike the UK, it did not fritter its oil and gas revenues keeping citizens on the dole. Instead it ploughed receipts into what is now a \u00a3380bn sovereign wealth fund poised to snap up assets at knock-down, post-crash prices. </p> <p><strong>Sir Tom Hunter</strong>, Scotland's richest man, may be nursing massive paper losses in housebuilding companies he bought such as Crest Nicholson and McCarthy &amp; Stone. But the billionaire philanthropist who made his fortune from shell suits sold out of doomed Icelandic bank Glitnir at the end of last year, making a tidy \u00a320m profit. </p> <p>A clutch of shrewd real estate tycoons cashed in their holdings before valuations plummeted. Top of the pile are <strong>Tony Pidgley</strong>, the Berkeley Group founder, <strong>Jamie Ritblat</strong>, who runs Delancey, which is backed by <strong>George Soros</strong>, and veteran property mogul <strong>Gerald Ronson</strong></p> <p>When they start buying, the bottom of the market is nigh.</p> <h2>The seers</h2> <p>It's one thing being a prophet of doom; it's another thing being bang on the money. <strong>Jon Moulton</strong>, boss of private equity firm Alchemy, is both.

  "<p>They are young, confident, affluent and have no memory of tougher times. But Generation Y now faces its first recession and a future very different to the one it expected. Aged from 18 to 27 and mostly middle-class, these young people have grown up in owner-occupied homes with total acceptance of technology, global warming and homeland terrorism - and their love of shopping has made them dream consumers. But, sooner or later, their lives are going to change.</p> <p>The average Generation Y-er does not know the difference between a credit card and a debit card, according to a Bank of Scotland survey, and, while two thirds know the price of an Apple iPod Mini (\u00a3179), three quarters have no idea what a pint of milk costs. One in eight thinks that 'in the red' means being embarrassed. They each have 800 illegally downloaded songs, and one in 20 spends more than \u00a3100 a month on mobile phone bills. Many never read newspapers and two thirds do not vote.</p> <p>They like to shop and, whether its Topshop, Primark or TK Maxx designer labels, they are used to getting what they want in a high street catering to almost every income level.</p> <p>If the credit crunch becomes a full-scale recession, no one will get a bigger shock to their aspirations than this pampered, techno-savvy generation.</p> <p>'They will be at the sharp end because that age is always at the sharp end of social change. They are trying to enter the adult world anyway, struggling with expectations and views that aren't theirs,' said Jon Savage, a music writer and author of Teenage: The Creation of Youth. 'But my question is: what are they going to do if they can't shop? Our society has been based around consumerism for the past 15 years and these kids have racks of CDs and plasma TVs and comparatively unparalleled riches.'</p> <p>At Birmingham University this weekend, The Observer gathered a group of first-year students - at the heart of Generation Y - to ask what the credit crunch meant to them. For many, the answer was 'not much'.</p> <p>'The credit crunch doesn't really affect me,' said Lauren Ludlow, a 20-year-old studying art history, one of the non-career-based subjects that traditionally slip in popularity in economic downturns. 'I'm more concerned for my parents and I'm just hoping it'll all have sorted itself out in three or four years' time.'</p> <p>Law student Jess Darley, 19, from Ipswich, added: 'I don't think it's been too over-hyped or anything, but young people don't really understand economics because we're not taught about it. I guess it probably does affect us, but it sort of feels irrelevant.' </p> <p>Some are cushioned by 'helicopter' parents - hovering protectively over their offspring. Amy Perry, 18, from Telford, said: 'My mum does most of my food shopping for me. I guess it will get more expensive for her for a while, though.'</p> <p>Few are fearful. They're just not that bothered. 'It doesn't mean much to me at all,' admitted Joe Griffiths, 19, from Southampton.</p> <p>Perhaps they are right not to worry. According to Dr David Twigg, a business lecturer at the University of Sussex, today's group of students are far more prepared for a difficult job market. </p> <p>'Anyone born after 1983 is not really used to considering anything other than wealth, but students are much more determined to build up a broad skill base; they'll work hard to get it and demand we provide the teaching,' he said. 'They will be successful no matter what; they are independent self-learners who are better equipped than any previous generation.'</p> <p>And while recessions inevitably bring financial strain, they are also known to inspire creativity. 'The last big recession produced punk, which was great,' said Savage, but he added that it was not all positive. 'You had to have a lot of bravery to be part of that and the Seventies also produced political polarisation and extremism, perhaps an easier option.</p> <p>'In the Thirties, the Great Depression brought that kind of increased regimentation by the state. When you're of Generation Y age, you are fairly open to becoming extremely obsessed with an idea, and you feel invulnerable and you don't have much idea of the consequences of your actions. It can be a dangerous mix.'</p> <p>Few organisations in education and the arts were prepared to talk about the future other than to fret that funding drops in a recession. One west London art gallery owner told The Observer: 'This stuff about kids getting creative in a recession is rot. It's not the Seventies; they have seen Damien Hirst and Banksy make millions and that's what Generation Y want, the same as Generation X - money. If they can't get it in art, they'll go and be eco-bankers.'</p> <p>Back in Birmingham, Paula, 19, (who didn't want to give her full name) said she was concerned about the impact of the credit crunch on her and her friends. 'The recession is having an influence that many of us fail to recognise. Food prices are increasing, while loans remain at the same rate. Student expenditure is on a constant rise and, if the recession continues, paying bank loans may mean a huge increase in interest. Many students have not even considered this; it needs to be more widely publicised.'</p> <p>The Consumer Credit Counselling Service has long had concerns over students being unable to manage their finances. In the past two years, it has seen a 10-fold increase in calls from 18- to 21-year-olds to its helpline. </p> <p>Others point to housing and warn that Generation Y will be one of the hardest hit. Adam Sampson, chief executive of the homeless charity Shelter, said lower prices wouldn't help because there would be fewer mortgages: 'These young people don't trust pensions any more and believe as much in house-as-security as their parents, who got us into this situation. But these kids have far less chance of getting on the ladder,' he said.</p> <p>'We have 240,000 new households forming every year and no one is building houses for them. They haven't been building enough for 20 years and that's some backlog. The recession will make that worse, as builders won't get money from the banks to build. I'm afraid Generation Y will be at home with mum and dad and we'll see the hidden homeless issue - overcrowding - get worse.'</p> <p>Charlotte Paul has two boys - Marcus, 14, and Charlie, 16 - and lives with her husband and his 22-year-old daughter in Yorkshire. 'My step-daughter was hoping to move into her own flat this year, but the mortgages weren't there, so she's squashed in here. It's been a shock to her because it's the first time in her life she has not been able to get something she wanted. She's just that age group; they've never been told, \"No, you can't have\",' said Mrs Paul. 'Now she wants to give up her job and go volunteering abroad for a year and she has no fear of coming back to no job. I envy her confidence.' </p> <p>For her boys, Mrs Paul is thinking the previously unthinkable. 'We've an endowment policy we kept to pay out in time for Charlie's second year at university and for Marcus we'd downsize the house and get Charlie on to the housing ladder at the same time. That's gone to pot. 'Charlie doesn't like the idea of university. I went to university to duck out of the last recession - there were grants and it kept me off the dole. Maybe not going will help him duck the debt and get experience.' Then, Mrs Paul stopped herself: 'I can't believe I'm thinking like this.'</p> <p>At business consultants Talent-smoothie, Simon Walker has spent a lot of time explaining the confident behaviour of Generation Y to perplexed employers. 'Will Generation Y behave differently now things aren't so rosy? Well, of course they will,' he said. </p> <p>'They are very different from other generations and have only known very buoyant times. They demand things like flexible working and expect to get it. Past generations turned up on their first day in a suit and tie and did what they were told, but that's changed and you cannot reverse that. We were approached by a company that had 50 per cent of the workforce who were Generation Y and they were worried that their inexperience with a downturn would lead to absenteeism and extra stress. But we haven't found that yet at all - they adapt. But then, at the moment, people are not losing their jobs.'</p> <p>When that happens, few believe things won't change, particularly on the high street. </p> <p>Robert Clarke, of business analysts Retail Knowledge Bank, argued that the high-profile reporting of the crisis would soon have an impact. 'We're getting it hour by hour, and that brings problems in itself,' he said.

The decline in house sales is already causing problems for those who have to sell a property to pay off an inheritance tax bill. </p> <p>Ed Mead, director of estate agency Douglas &amp; Gordon, says: 'What most people are struggling with is what properties are worth at times when no one wants to buy, but it's a matter of being pretty aggressive on the pricing.'</p> <p>This may cause complications with probate, however. Mead says that while prices were rising, the probate office kept a keen eye on any difference between the valuation done for probate purposes and the eventual sale price, being quick to claim any extra tax incurred. 'I would like to think this will be put into reverse now that prices are falling,' he says. And Wynn Thomas of London law firm Dawsons points out that payment of tax can be deferred for up to one year and then paid in annual installments, although interest is payable after the first six months.</p> <p><strong>Debt</strong></p> <p>People in their fifties and sixties should be saving hard in the run-up to retirement, but research released by Payplan last week shows that people in this age group are significantly more in debt than other age groups, and face having to delay stopping work. Those who are indebted have average unsecured debts of \u00a341,400 - 25 per cent higher than the average for other age groups.</p> <p>John Fairhurst, managing director of Payplan, says: 'Most people imagine that, as they reach the countdown to finishing work, they will have paid off their mortgage and be busily saving for a comfortable retirement. These figures show that this is simply not the case for many 'pre-retirees' and highlights a hugely concerning trend towards indebtedness in later life. </p> <p>'Although many people in their fifties are used to maintaining high levels of personal debt, they are often just \"treading water\" with repayments, covering little more than interest charges. If they are to enjoy a reasonable standard of living in later life, then it is vital that they have a clear plan for becoming debt free while they are still working.'</p> <p><strong>Pensions</strong></p> <p>As stock markets have yo-yo'd over the past few weeks, so have the value of pension funds. Ideally, anyone within 10 years of retirement should have started switching their money from shares to less risky investments and cash to reduce the effect of such volatility on future retirement income.</p> <p>If you haven't, says Tom McPhail of Hargreaves Lansdown, you face a tough choice: 'You could keep your money in the stock market in the hope that this will be a short downturn. Or you could have to look at deferring your retirement for another couple of years. This could be difficult, particularly if your employer is saying your time is up.'</p> <p>If you do have to retire imminently, there are several options to reduce damage to your future financial wellbeing, says McPhail. Rather than buying an annuity, you could opt for income drawdown (usually only available for those with \u00a350,000 or more in their pension fund, and more suitable for those with \u00a3100,000-plus). 'But try to take as small an income as possible, because drawing a big income from a fund that is falling in value can do a lot of damage very quickly,' he warns.</p> <p>Alternatively, you could take your 25 per cent tax-free cash, stick it in a savings account, live off it for the next five years and leave the rest invested until the market recovers. Or take a smaller amount - say 20 per cent - of your pension fund, one quarter as tax-free cash through an annuity and the rest to provide a small regular income. McPhail says that inflation-linking an annuity now is very expensive: it may be better to opt for a flat rate increase of, say, 3 per cent every year, or a level annuity which pays out the same amount of income until death. </p> <h2>Seventy-plus</h2> <p>Soaring energy and food prices are hitting pensioners hard, taking up a disproportionately large portion of their income. Help the Aged and Friends of the Earth were granted a judicial review, which took place last week, in a bid to force the government to stand by promises made in 2000 to eradicate fuel poverty by 2016 and to eliminate it among vulnerable households by 2010. But a recent report by Age Concern found that more than half of older people are cutting back on essentials such as heating and food. Those on low incomes may qualify for pension credit, housing allowance and council tax benefit. Apply for all three at the same time by calling 0800 009966.</p> <p>Many people from their seventies onwards will be relying on the value of their home to provide money through equity release to cover long-term care costs . This works well for couples where one partner is entering care but the other needs to carry on living in the home. It does not work for single people, as any scheme will end once they enter a home permanently. Andrea Rozario, director-general of Safe Home Income Plans (<a href=\"http://www.ship-ltd.org\">ship-ltd.org</a>; 0870 241 6060), which promotes safe equity release schemes, says that increasing numbers of applicants are also using these schemes to pay off debts that have followed them into retirement.</p> <p>However, in August 2007, Nigel Hare-Scott of equity release firm Home &amp; Capital warned Cash readers that if they wanted to release equity from their homes, they should take action before prices started falling. Now that prices have tumbled, he says applicants are quite prosaic about valuations coming in at up to 30 per cent lower than previously expected, but the important thing now is to choose a scheme which fits the applicant's needs. 'Schemes can be designed to pay out on a monthly basis, or as and when you need money, or to pay out a lump sum,' he says.</p> <p>If there is not enough equity in an applicant's property to meet their needs, Hare-Scott suggests that if that person has children who are working, they might be able to withdraw equity through a conventional repayment mortgage to help top up funds.</p>",
  "<p>Banks are to start sharing detailed information about customers struggling with their credit card balances, as part of an industry initiative to increase responsible lending.</p> <p>Up until now, banks have exchanged details about how much credit customers have access to, how much they are using and whether they are making payments on time. But according to Apacs, the UK's payments-processing association, credit card companies will also now share data about customers who regularly pay only the minimum every month and use their credit cards to withdraw cash, both regarded as 'distress signals'.</p> <p>Sandra Quinn, director of communications for Apacs, says she hopes that the 17 credit card companies that belong to the association and comprise 97 per cent of the UK credit card industry will be sharing data by the end of the year. According to Apacs, 11 per cent - 3.4 million credit card holders - pay the minimum amount required every month, and 4 per cent are in financial difficulty.</p> <p>However, the initiative is being undermined by some banks, which have reduced their required minimum payment for some customers. </p> <p>Last week HBOS announced that it was changing its rules on minimum credit card payments, to help those who have incurred high charges to reduce their balances. Alex Barnett, a spokesman for the banking group, says that under the previous rules, its four million customers were required to pay a simple minimum of 2 per cent of any outstanding balance over \u00a35. But this disadvantaged those who had used their cards to withdraw cash or gamble online and thereby incurred a much higher interest rate (23.9 per cent APR, compared to 15.9 per cent APR for purchases on its All in One card).</p> <p>'If they were paying the minimum, all their monthly payment might go to paying off the charges, rather than reducing the principal,' he says.</p> <p>Now HBOS requires customers to pay either 1 per cent of the outstanding balance, or monthly interest charges plus insurance premiums, late payment charges (if any) and \u00a35, whichever is the greater. Although the new rules halve the amount customers who do not incur higher charges and interest will have to pay, Barnett says: 'This is a fairer way of calculating the minimum payment. It ensures that an element of the outstanding balance is always repaid. This is responsible lending.' He adds that, typically, only those on very low APRs have the option of paying the 1 per cent minimum monthly repayment. </p> <p>The new charging structure could encourage some of those who take out 0 per cent balance-transfer offers to reduce their monthly repayment, enabling HBOS to make more money out of them when the interest rate reverts to its normal levels. However, Barnett adds that HBOS recommends customers pay back more than the minimum each month: 'Our summary boxes clearly state that paying just the minimum means it will take [customers] longer to pay off their balance. Under the new rules, customers who typically have higher APR transactions, such as those who make cash withdrawals, will actually pay off their debts in a shorter period of time.' </p> <p>MBNA, which has seven million customers and provides cards for Virgin, Alliance &amp; Leicester, Manchester United and several charities, as well as those under its own brand name, has also recently changed its charging rules.</p> <p>Paul Lawler, a spokesman for the bank, says that MBNA used to require customers to pay the lower of 3 per cent of the outstanding balance, or interest plus \u00a35 and any fees or charges incurred, but adds: 'We found that hardly anyone was paying the percentage, so we have switched to the greater of \u00a325, or interest plus \u00a35 and fees and charges incurred.' Provided a customer does not incur fees or charges, the minimum of \u00a325 works out lower than 3 per cent for balances of \u00a3833 or more, at least until monthly interest charges themselves start to exceed \u00a320.</p> <p>Research by the University of Warwick has found that the existence of a minimum payment tends to reduce the actual amount many people choose to pay on their bills, leading to further interest payments. The survey, by Neil Stewart, is to be published in Psychological Science and focuses on the phenomenon of 'anchoring', in which arbitrary numbers bias people's judgments.</p> <p>For those who make only partial repayments of the outstanding balance (about 35 per cent of card holders), the suggested minimum payment on the statement acts as an 'anchor' and lowers the actual repayments people make.</p> <p>'These results should be of real concern to credit card companies,' Stewart says. 'Virtually all credit card statements include minimum payments, but this consumer safeguard has an unexpected negative consequence. Minimum payments distort the behaviour of many customers. Those paying off the balance in full each month seem to be immune, but anyone repaying only part of the debt is at risk - not just those making only the minimum payment.'</p> <h2>Painful lesson for a hard-up student</h2> <p><strong>One Cash reader remembers how years of student loans, plentiful credit and easy minimum repayments almost led to financial disaster</strong></p> <p>'It was my third year at university, I was studying for my finals and was skint. I'd reached the \u00a33,000 limit of my overdraft, spent my student loan, and had no way to access any more money. Unable to juggle a part-time job with my studies, I opted to take out a credit card to see me through to the end of the year. Quickly reaching the limit of \u00a3500, I had every intention of transferring the money to another card when my interest-free period ran out. Needless to say, I didn't. Instead, the minimum monthly repayments started to come out of my account, with me giving it little thought. </p> <p>'In the meantime, I finished university and opted to move to London. Without any spare cash to put down a deposit on a room and to get me through until my first pay check, I took out a graduate loan of \u00a33,500. I also intended to use it to settle my overdraft and credit card, but the early days of London life got the better of me and before I knew it I'd managed to fritter most of it away. It felt like such a bargain at the time; money for nothing and so easy to get my hands on.</p> <p>'I dread to think how much money I have let slip though. In four years of minimum credit card repayments, I'd paid off only \u00a336 of my debt. I appreciate my situation could have been worse though. I could easily have been swayed to borrow a lot more and was lucky to be in a job that enabled me, with a bit of cutting back, to pay off the two debts in one lump sum when the current financial climate finally shook me to my senses.</p> <p>'Restraining myself with a credit card limit of \u00a3500 four years ago was the only sensible decision I made in all of this.'</p> <h2>My lucrative life as a 'card tart' is finally over</h2> <p><strong>Another anonymous Cash reader explains how his hair-raisingly ingenious scheme to pay off a 5 per cent mortgage with 0 per cent credit cards has become a victim of information-sharing </strong></p> <p>'In 2001, the daily thud on my doormat of 0 per cent interest credit card offers got me thinking that maybe there really was such a thing as a free lunch.</p> <p>'Initially I just applied for one credit card to pay off some debt and used the remaining credit limit to put cash into a savings account, earning interest. This worked OK, but once tax was deducted it didn't make a fortune and wasn't really worth the hassle.</p> <p>'Then along came Intelligent Finance and its clever offset approach. This made the opportunity all the more rewarding, borrowing at 0 per cent and offsetting against a mortgage rate of 5 per cent made obvious sense, a risk-free return and no tax to pay.</p> <p>'Slowly I built up a portfolio of cards, each time increasing credit limits, and by moving available credit off cards into my current account with IF, I gradually built a lump sum of cash offsetting my mortgage, paying the minimum required each month. I found it hard to borrow more than \u00a370,000 at any one time as cards continually needed to be repaid. However, seeing the benefits, my wife also started to apply for cards, which meant our pot of cash reached the giddy heights of more than \u00a3100,000 in 2005. At this point, we were earning around \u00a3500 a month.</p> <p>'However, that was as good as it got. Lenders gradually started to introduce balance transfer fees, reducing the potential benefit. As of today, as far as I am aware, only Abbey has a card with no balance transfer fee. However, even this is interest-free for only six months.</p> <p>'The news that credit card companies will soon be sharing information on customers who don't reduce their balances is the final nail in the coffin and I'm running down my last few cards. Making money is still possible, but to nothing like the extent it was. </p> <p>'So I'm retiring as a card tart, pleased with the knowledge that by simply filling in a credit card application every month or two, I've knocked almost \u00a340,000 off my mortgage.'</p> <p>\u2022 A tool to help people understand the link between repayments and interest charges is available at <a href=\"http://www.warwick.ac.uk/go/decisiontool/\">warwick.ac.uk/go/decisiontool/</a></p>",

We no longer care whether the winner gets to be a superstar - for every Leona there must be a Michelle McManus (the winner of series two of Pop Idol, back in the mists of 2003) - but boy do we get caught up in the 'journey'.</p> <p>Having been artfully constructed by Reality in the first place, Cheryl Cole is, of course, the perfect Reality Judge. She laughs, she cries, she smiles, she empathises, and while it's entirely conceivable that she also breaks wind/ fingernails/ crockery (if only when she's rowing with Ashley), it's of little relevance - in X Factor she's the embodiment of the dream, the contestants' desires and fears made glowing, buff, honeyed, moneyed flesh. Cheryl's perfect, and perfectly flawed: all that glamour, all that fame, all that money, all that pain... I - we - can't get enough of her.</p> <p>And then there's Dannii - poor Dannii! Not quite as young, not quite as beautiful, not quite as warm, not quite as lovable, not quite as preposterously successful (or, indeed, married to a cheating Premiership footballer) as Cheryl... and how I love her for all that. Obviously I haven't got a clue whether she and Ms Cole really hate each other (and don't particularly want or need to know) but the judges' own emotional backstory, even if entirely constructed in a press office, is almost as powerful as those of the contestants, spilling out into the tabloids, discussed around the nations' watercoolers, making us alert to every little subtlety of body language and alive to every apparently random editing choice. When Dannii frowns, for example, it's possible to read an awful lot into it, even beyond the fact that it's pretty tough to frown when you (may, possibly, can't rule it out, can we?) have had a teensy bit of Botox.</p> <p>And then there are the contestants. The choices for the live finals were, of course, guaranteed to have you howling 'noooooooooooooo!' at the telly (beautiful Suzie, dumped from the over 25s? Noooooooooooo!). But what were the odds that Daniel, the bereaved single dad, wasn't going to make it, even if he has about as much chance of winning as I do? Or that Rachel, the single mum bad-girl-turned-good belting out her broken heart, chipped nail varnish 'n' all, wouldn't get through? Or that pumped-up Austin, equal parts testosterone and tears, and baby-faced Eoghan (who looks uncannily like Britain's Got Talent's George Sampson) wouldn't get a shot? Or that Hannah, who has a stunning voice, would lose out for not being enough of a looker? Aw, come on - we're all on the journey, and as journeys go it's currently whupping Strictly's spangly feelgood celebrity ass. Feel the pain, you know you want to... and then make sure you watch tonight's Britain's Got the Pop Factor... and Possibly a New Celebrity Jesus Christ Soapstar Strictly on Ice (C4), in which Peter Kay satirises the whole sorry, riveting business. Enjoy the journey.</p> <p>While the channels race to come up with the perfect credit-crunch property formats ('Garage or Garret?' - home conversions designed to minimise the sting of negative equity; 'Bathroom or Bust!' - the game show in which contestants compete for a new designer wet room... or breast implants!; 'Strip Tease' - teams of decorators strip wallpaper... in the buff!) and because we need quick, relatively affordable consumerist fixes and a sprinkling of rhinestone stardust on our little black dresses, recessions often work in fashion's favour, so the double bill of <strong>Twiggy's Frock Exchange</strong> and <strong>British Style Genius</strong> are, ahem, tailor made for these interesting times. </p> <p>The first show sees the former Lesley Hornby of Neasden, Grazia's fashion director Paula Reed and sparky Culture Show girl Lauren Laverne, presiding over a frockswapshop, in which 100 women bring five items of clothing they no longer wear and give them away to those who want to - a phenomenon known as 'swishing' (which I'd thought was something else entirely) which is big in the States. </p> <p>Elsewhere, old clothes were remade and remodelled, a dealer in second- (third-, fourth-, fifth-) hand clothes was followed foraging for bargains in Huddersfield (one can only hope she has a back-up county for her fashion foraging having outed West Yorkshire as the proverbial pot of gold at the end of the vintage rainbow), and the sum total was all very cosy and girly, if also ever so slightly subdued, perhaps because, somehow, TV always feels a bit guilty about wanting to enjoy fashion as much as it should.</p> <p><strong>British Style Genius</strong>, which followed, is already shaping up to be the best documentary series about fashion I've ever seen (previously, it would have been pinking shears at dawn between the gorgeous Savile Row, on BBC4 earlier this year, and C4's illuminating and insightful 2003 series This Model Life</p> <p>Not only did it offer a unique opportunity see Kate Moss talking (those flat south London vowels interchangeable with Twiggy's northwest London ditto) but talking without wearing make-up, and not looking remotely soignee or glamorous, or even particularly beautiful - as it took us on an accurate and beautifully directed journey through the best part of 50 years of British fashion, with brilliantly sourced nostalgic archive material and contributions from numerous proper, pukka, grown-up fashionistas, from Biba's Barbara Hulanicki to American Vogue's Anna Wintour, with Philip Green the cheerful cherry on an otherwise fat-free, wheat-free cake.</p> <p>The footage of Biba in its Kensington Church St incarnation (before it took over the Derry &amp; Toms building in Kensington High Street, throwing open its doors to the nation's teen shoplifters) took me straight back to those hours spent burying my face in Biba's feather boas while my mother bought T-shirt dresses by the armful, and then the sight of the late Ossie Clark - the gifted, tortured designer genius whose clothes make my heart skip a beat even now - not only reminded me of my mother's enviably Ossie-stuffed 1970s wardrobe, but of how much I love clothes - and why they matter more than we ever quite give them credit for, crunch or otherwise.</p> <h2>North or south</h2> <p>If there is such a thing as a North-South divide in drama, then the lines may be drawn between <strong>Sunshine</strong> (BBC1) and <strong>Beautiful People</strong> (BBC2). I was certain I would loathe the latter - Jonathan Harvey's adaptation of Simon Doonan's memoir about growing up in Reading and finding himself, camply and fabulously, window-dressing in New York. But I love this bittersweet Ab-Fabulous cross between Skins and The Wonder Years, replete with gloriously spiky dialogue (and song-and-dance numbers), because beneath the brittle, biting wit there beats a big, generous heart, which is as southern a sensibility as it gets. </p> <p>Meanwhile Craig Cash and Phil Mealey's endearing three-parter, in which Steve Coogan (and his improbably white Hollywood teeth, left) plays - beautifully - a binman with a gambling addiction which threatens to destroy his family, is all hearts-on-its-sleeves, buns-in-the-oven and tears-before-bedtime; a thing of quiet, uplifting beauty. Together they constitute a double-bill of wholly British brilliance.</p>",
  "<p>If only more world statesmen were like Chris Patten. A man whose erudition is surpassed only by his reasonableness, he never quite found a happy home in Britain's confrontational politics. The grand homme of foreign affairs has, in his latest book, addressed all the burning issues - climate change, migration, disease, nuclear proliferation, water shortage and energy security. Frustratingly, the banking crisis of 2008 came after his deadline. No matter, there is still much to grip the reader in a book that manages the rare feat of engaging both those versed in foreign affairs and those who possess only fleeting knowledge.</p> <p>What Next? mixes polemic (his disdain for the US neoconservatives is palpable) with perspective. Thus Patten contends that, in spite of Iraq, 9/11, terrorism and the resurgence of authoritarian China and Russia, 'looking back on our survival through the second half of the 20th century, it is difficult to believe that today's world is more dangerous'. He illustrates his point not only with historical reference, but with his schoolboy memory of Nevil Shute's novel On the Beach, about the last months of a group of survivors of a nuclear attack.</p> <p>Patten is at his most compelling through his use of detail. He describes how the small, breakaway region of Transdniestr, a Russian-dominated enclave in the European state of Moldova, is an officially sanctioned mafia hideout. From here, he points out, many wars are fuelled, from Chechnya to Africa. He helps to explain the poverty in Congo by identifying its customs regime as being at the root of corruption, and elucidates the correlation between countries' dependency on commodity exports and their susceptibility to conflict. He points out that it would require only $15bn to meet the United Nations Millennium Development goal of halving the number of people who lack access to safe drinking water, compared to 'the approximately $100bn a year spent on bottled water'. </p> <p>An ardent European, he feels let down not only by British Europhobes, but also by the behaviour of EU governments. He laments the response, particular of Italy, Germany and France, to Vladimir Putin's energy blackmail. 'Some of the countries that squawk most noisily about European visions and commitments... have been the most nationalistic in cutting their own bilateral deals with Russia and Gazprom.'</p> <p>It is in the last two chapters, on democracy, that Patten unleashes his passion. The man who, as governor of Hong Kong, was reviled by the Chinese Communist party, and was prepared to engage in argument with Lee Kuan Yew's 'managed democracy' of Singapore, cannot hide his despair at those who claim that their countries are not yet ripe for freedom and human rights. As for the term 'managed democracy', so beloved of the Russians and Chinese, he writes: 'It is a good rule of thumb to assume that whenever the word democracy is preceded, as a definition of a form of government, by some descriptive prefix, then one thing it is not is democratic'.</p> <p>Yet this book could have surprised more, challenged more. Patten correctly blames the neocons for undermining the cause that he and they shared - the spreading of freedom around the world. He calls for greater multilateral engagement, for the reinforcing of institutions such as the UN. But he tells us little about how any of this is to be achieved and offers few new ideas for reconciling principle, pragmatism and national interest. 'You cannot be in favour of democracy in India, but not so interested in it in Pakistan; you cannot say that you will fight for it in Afghanistan, but ignore it in Uzbekistan.' But that is surely what governments, whether distorted by Bush/Blair messianic zeal or not, have always done.</p> <p>Patten is convinced that ultimately the new authoritarianism will collapse under the weight of its own contradictions. He fails, however, to provide proof. What if the priorities of the next generation change? What if individuals place security and prosperity before liberty? What if this recipe delivers stability and contentment? And what if our apparent relief at the state's intervention in the current economic crisis is a prelude to even greater control on us as an individual? Towards the end, Patten pays a rare compliment to Bush and the democratisation theory that he espoused, but failed to deliver. 'Criticise the man by all means, lament the damage he did to such a good cause, but the cause itself is right and its adherents are slowly but surely winning,' he declares. I hope he is right, but somehow I think he is wrong. </p> <p>\u2022 John Kampfner's book on authoritarian capitalism will be published next year by Simon &amp; Schuster</p>",
  "<p>Bad news is generally good news for the media. At times of crisis, newspaper sales rise and more viewers tune in to television bulletins in search of information. Few stories are as dramatic, or as complicated, as the global credit crunch, which has bought the world's financial system to its knees, although this time, newspapers have not seen their year on year circulations increase. Figures released by the Audit Bureau of Circulations on Friday showed that sales of many 'quality' titles recorded monthly rises in September, but falls compared with the same month last year. </p> <p>Without the turmoil in the financial markets, however, those figures might have been far worse. The credit crunch has elevated financial news to the front pages, and turned the BBC's Robert Peston, a former Financial Times reporter, into a household name, prompting the Daily Mail to ask last week: 'Does this BBC man have too much power?' </p> <p>That probably tells us as much about journalistic envy as it does about Peston's influence, but it also demonstrates that City journalists are unique in one respect: the stories they write can move markets in a way that others rarely do. When he has referred to individual banks, Peston has been careful to stress that savers are unlikely to lose their money, and others have exercised similar restraint as the crisis has unfolded. The FT changed a front-page reference to 'the world in fear' to 'the world in turmoil' last week, as executives at the paper tried to communicate the momentous nature of the news without exaggerating its effect. </p> <p>Even Peston did not see the crash coming, however. Should City editors and economics correspondents have predicted it? </p> <p>Alex Brummer, the Daily Mail's experienced City editor, believes they should have done. He argues that, although City journalists covered the problems of some individual companies creditably, few grasped the enormity, or scale, of the situation. </p> <p>'They were slow off the mark originally,' he says, pointing out that young journalists who weren't working during the last financial crisis in the 1970s did not have the foresight to realise that a problem at one institution can quickly become a problem for all. 'That has something to do with the age profile. They've been brought up in a period of non-stop output and growth. I cut my teeth as a financial journalist in the white heat of the 1976 financial crisis, when 25 banks went under. Having lived through all of that you learned a [crisis] spreads from one institution to another and [governments] need to do something very quickly to stabilise the system.'</p> <p>Brummer's historical perspective is something only a few share. Jeff Randall, a business journalist and the Daily Telegraph's editor-at-large, has been warning about personal debt and an unsustainable housing boom for years, and others have voiced similar concerns. Yet few identified the sub-prime market, or the credit crunch, as triggers that would push the world to the brink of recession, and senior figures at the FT admit they should probably have done better in that regard. Dan B\u00f6gler, the paper's managing editor, says: 'We believed the bankers when they said derivatives were making the world safer by spreading risk. But in reality it became a game of pass the parcel and the parcel ended up in the hands of those who least understood it. We take our share of the blame for that. </p> <p>'Why didn't we spot it? Unfortunately, financial journalists - and the FT has better-trained financial journalists than others - don't really understand this stuff, and they join a long list of people that starts with bank regulators, central bank regulators and money managers.' </p> <p>Marjorie Scardino, CEO of the paper's owner, Pearson, berated the paper for failing to uncover wrongdoing at Enron; B\u00f6gler says that was unfair. 'That was fraud. Enron was hiding stuff from everyone.' This time Scardino has stayed silent, but some of the criticism aimed at the financial press may be justified. </p> <p>B\u00f6gler adds that there were dissenting voices, including some on the FT. Gillian Tett, its capital markets editor, had been warning about the credit markets for 'at least a year' before the crisis, he points out, and the paper's influential Lex column wrote regularly about over-priced assets. Martin Dickson, the FT's deputy editor, points out that 'no one in the media - or indeed banking and government - may have anticipated the full depths of this crisis, but FT readers were warned long in advance about the serious imbalances in the financial system. Tett was ringing alarm bells months before the rest of the press caught up'. </p> <p>B\u00f6gler claims that since the financial system began to unravel, its coverage has been peerless, and rivals generally agree. Brummer admires Tett's coverage. 'She has got to grips with some of the technical stuff, the mechanical background.' </p> <p>The Sun's business editor, Ian King, who will shortly move to the Times, says: 'I think the coverage has been absolutely terrific. On papers like our own it's a particular challenge because financial news is often baffling for the lay reader.' He points out that eight out of 10 City analysts were still issuing 'buy' notes on Northern Rock the day before it collapsed, and only one was recommending their clients sell shares in the bank. 'Experts didn't see it coming.' </p> <p>King has had triumphs of his own, calling for co-ordinated interest rate cuts to avert a depression the day before central banks around the world did just that, but he points out that the global nature of the crisis, and the fact markets are always open somewhere in the world, has presented news organisations with a problem and an opportunity. </p> <p>The printed products have often looked out of date by the time they hit the streets, but websites have come into their own. The FT's Dickson points out: 'The credit crisis has given a tremendous boost to our circulation and our website viewing figures. We have seen double-digit jumps in global retail sales in recent weeks while FT.com page views have risen by 300 per cent and unique users by 250 per cent. Why? We are a global newspaper and this is a global crisis.' </p> <p>In the mainstream press, business journalists are enjoying their moment in the spotlight, but there is also an acceptance that too many are obsessed with the day-to-day grind of financial reporting, obsessing about corporate takeovers or reporting company results. </p> <p>As the only voices within papers explaining the financial world to colleagues who don't understand it, City editors can also become unwitting cheerleaders for the Square Mile. </p> <p>Brummer says that too many financial journalists are bamboozled by the 'manipulative' PR operations of big companies, and some are too fearful that they will lose access if they are too critical. 'The duty of a journalist is always to be sceptical. But they are up against very powerful institutions who lie and cheat.'</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on October 19 2008.

  "<p>Speaking up for trust in recent years has been about as thankless as hippy Neil's exhortation of 'peace and love, man' against the brutal realpolitik of Vivian in The Young Ones. The latter has all the good lines, and if they don't work, a swift head butt will finish the argument. In the same way, what weight does namby-pamby trust carry against the arguments of self-interest and the knockout blow of Loadsamoney?</p> <p>We now know the answer. As today's banking paralysis demonstrates, trust is something business can't do without. It isn't some fuzzy nice-to-have; it's the lubricant without which the City and Wall Street are as frozen as a rusted motor.</p> <p>If there is debt or credit, there has to be trust. It doesn't have to be personal, or even direct: when you use a card to buy a meal in a restaurant, it's not you the restaurant is trusting, it's HSBC or American Express, which will do nicely. </p> <p>Just how important this impersonal or institutionalised trust has become is described by Paul Seabright in his book The Company of Strangers. When you buy something as simple as a shirt, he says, you are the final node in a global trust network straddling a dozen countries, the whole chain dependent on confidence among all the other nodes that their unseen customer or supplier on the other side of the world will keep their side of the bargain. According to one estimate, in developed economies all but a tiny proportion of GDP is ultimately attributable to trust.</p> <p>As Seabright's example hints, historically business and trade were considered a civilising influence on humanity. Trust is a kind of moral leverage. Making trade (and wealth) rather than war required people to be honest, respect contracts and collaborate readily with strangers - all essential elements in the 'commercial syndrome' of behaviours identified by Jane Jacobs in her masterly investigation of the moral roots of business and politics, Systems of Survival</p> <p>Alas, few people advance the doux commerce thesis these days. Rather the reverse: the City and Wall Street have become bywords for selfishness and greed; not for nothing was the book about an earlier outbreak of insider greed, the leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco in 1990, entitled Barbarians at the Gate. Trust may be crucial, but is also extremely hard to manage. As the present crisis graphically shows, too much is as bad as too little, a succinct description of today's situation being that investors have gone from trusting anybody to trusting nobody almost overnight.</p> <p>The institution of management bears much of the responsibility for this debacle, having eagerly adopted a model that encourages managers to maximise short-term profits (and their own pay packets) at the expense of the greater good. This doctrine enshrines suspicion and lack of trust at its heart, and deliberately declines any concern with morality. By this means managers have indeed enriched themselves, but at the expense of wholesale loss of their own trust and legitimacy, which has come back to bite them. Company executives have not only forfeited the trust of their own employees and society as a whole - they don't even trust each other.</p> <p>This is serious. Not surprisingly, and rightly, regulation is in the air. New rules will inevitably come, but it is not inevitable that they will have the effect intended. Consider Sarbanes-Oxley (Sox), the US legislation hastily passed after the Enron and WorldCom scandals in 2002. Sox is now thought in many quarters to have been a disaster, increasing frictional costs and bureaucracy and providing a field day for legal and accountancy firms, without changing the behaviour which causes the problems. Witness Northern Rock, AIG and Lehman: they may not have committed legal offences, but in their excessive short-termism they are Enron's spiritual heirs.</p> <p>If son of Sox can't prevent the emergence of another generation of Enrons in a decade's time, what can? One radical answer is put forward in the October issue of Harvard Business Review. Two prominent Harvard professors, Rakesh Khurana and Nitin Nohria, argue that to repair managers' shattered legitimacy, 'business leaders must embrace a way of looking at their role that goes beyond their responsibility to the shareholder to include a civic and personal commitment to their duty as institutional custodians. In other words, it is time management became a true profession'.</p> <p>Unlike doctors and lawyers, they say, managers 'don't need a formal education, let alone a licence, to practise. Neither do they adhere to a universal, enforceable code of conduct'. They think managers should have to swear a version of the Hippocratic oath, a rigorous code of ethics covering personal conduct and responsibilities to society. Controversial? Certainly. But unless managers urgently find ways to restore society's broken trust, they will find their legitimate jobs hemmed in by much tighter restrictions - and have only themselves to blame.</p>",
  "<p>More than a million Britons will be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/unemploymentdata\">out of work</a> and on the dole by next month as the toxic fallout from Black October filters down to ordinary families, economists are warning. </p> <p>A bleak Christmas lies ahead for many as the City turmoil spreads into the so-called real economy. Companies are now being squeezed on two vital fronts, with shoppers abandoning the high street and bank lending drying up, making it almost impossible for smaller businesses to get credit to stay afloat. </p> <p>Geoff Hoon, the new Transport Secretary, yesterday warned that there were 'potentially serious consequences for small business, for employment' from the current crisis, reflecting private warnings to the Prime Minister's new economic 'war cabinet' that job losses and business collapses later this year are now virtually inevitable. </p> <p>Official unemployment figures for September, due on Wednesday, are expected to show another increase in job losses - although this will not yet be the sharp upward spike which is expected as the full consequences of last week's stock-market crash filter through. Some forecasts suggest that unemployment will hit two million by Christmas. </p> <p>Some government officials warned that those slipping into unemployment could find themselves much more isolated than in the last recession. They pointed out that unemployment benefits had slipped relative to earnings and there were now fewer council houses available. </p> <p>Senior Tories this weekend called for a freeze on new employment rights, in a shift away from David Cameron's previous enthusiasm for measures like extra parental leave, arguing that the priority was to save jobs by reducing business red tape. Alan Duncan, the shadow business secretary, will host an emergency summit this week on ways of preventing small businesses from going bust.</p> <p>Chris Grayling, the shadow work and pensions secretary, told The Observer it would become 'more difficult' to make the case for flexible working in the darkening economic climate and called for deregulation to take the pressure off employers: 'The one thing government must recognise is that it can't keep piling regulation on small business when that could (determine) the decision whether to keep somebody in a job or not.'</p> <p>Ministers are now under similar pressure to defend jobs, with some Labour MPs reporting a backlash from constituents furious that billions have been spent rescuing bankers while factory workers' jobs go to the wall. </p> <p>The British Retail Consortium will release figures this week showing another fall in sales on the high street last month, with director general Stephen Robertson warning that sales for non-food retailers such as electrical stores had 'fallen off a cliff'. Some retailers are reducing opening hours to save costs. </p> <p>Shoppers are also cutting back on 'big ticket' purchases like cars, with the number of new registrations in September down by a fifth on August, according to the SMMT, the motor vehicle manufacturing body. Car plants have already axed thousands of temporary staff and put others on four-day weeks or halted overtime. 'If there is no pick-up in demand for cars, there are bound to be more job losses next year,' said Roger Madison, national automotive officer for the Unite union.</p> <p>Others at risk include the aviation industry - Willie Walsh, the British Airways chief executive, is predicting that up to 30 airlines worldwide will go bust - while further losses are likely in the City. Unemployed bankers are being advised to seek work in Shanghai or Mumbai amid warnings that the Square Mile will be permanently reshaped by the crisis.</p> <p>'City people I speak to are despairing because they may not get another job for a year,' said Shaun Springer, chief executive of the City headhunting firm Napier Scott. 'For the first time in 30 years in the City, I'm scared.'</p> <p>With charitable donations falling, even the voluntary sector is also cutting jobs. Oxfam needs to shave its budget by up to 15 per cent because of falling income, while the National Council of Voluntary Organisations expects some smaller charities to go under. </p> <p>Alan Clarke, economist from the bank BNP Paribas, said the number of those claiming unemployment benefit was due to break the one million mark by the end of next month at the latest, with up to two million looking for work by December: he is forecasting unemployment to hit 7 per cent by the middle of next year and carry on rising until 2010.</p> <p>Philip Shaw, economist at Investec, said it was difficult to be optimistic: 'The sentiment is one of widespread doom and gloom. Businesses are now being affected by the credit squeeze. The economy has shuddered to a halt.' </p> <p>At the height of the 1980s recession, three million were unemployed. The question now is how far the pain will spread. As one boss told a senior CBI official: 'We know there is a tsunami coming, but we do not know if it's going to knock us over or just wet our feet.' </p> <p>The speed with which the bubble burst is one of the most striking factors of this crisis, and could help determine what happens next. Consumer confidence is now lower on some indices than in the 1980s slump or even the mid-1970s, according to the pollster Peter Kellner, suggesting that Britons unused to tough times are quicker to panic than in previous slumps - leading to a more sudden fall in sales, and consequently a more severe immediate threat to jobs. </p> <p>'It may be that paradoxically because it's been so good for the last 16 years people are not used to the idea (of bad times) whereas in previous times the boom and bust rolled around so regularly that it was less of a shock to the system,' he argues.</p> <p>No wonder Labour MPs' celebrations after last week's banking bailout package were shortlived. 'The big picture is obviously deeply worrying,' said one Cabinet aide. 'But at least Gordon is playing a blinder: he looks so comfortable in his own skin for the first time in a long time.'</p> <p>The Prime Minister has indeed been revitalised by the crisis, his confidence visibly soaring: he trounced David Cameron at the dispatch box last week over City bonuses, and is now seeing his stance vindicated as other world leaders rush to copy his banking bailout. Finally, he is in his political element, leading international debate. Nonetheless, Labour's long-term prospects, with an election in 2010, are unclear. Brown could survive the crash, as John Major did with re-election in 1992, or be forced from office. Brown's argument today that his banking plan will reduce the pain felt by Britain will be critical. 'If there is a slight blip but nothing too serious, and Gordon is seen to have played a major role in pulling Britain through, then I'm not saying Labour will definitely win, but it's game on,' says Kellner. 'Alternatively, if it is a disaster we could have a Conservative landslide.'</p> <p>There are fears across all three parties that the British National Party may profit from rising unemployment. Grayling argues that healthy employment levels among foreign nationals have masked the loss of 250,000 jobs in the last years among British men: around half of new jobs created under Labour have gone to overseas workers. Widespread job losses among unskilled, working-class Britons could provide dangerous ammunition for extremist parties and fuel the rise of anti-immigrant sentiment. </p> <p>Unions are warning that the government must use its stake in the banks to free up lending, keeping businesses afloat and protecting jobs. Hugo Sellert, head of economic research at the online recruitment firm Monster, which has seen the number of employers recruiting fall dramatically, says the biggest fear is of business lending drying up. 'We have yet to see the full impact of the financial crisis and the recent dramatic events spill over into the jobs market,' he said. 'The worst is still to come.'</p> <p>Which would mean tough decisions not just for employers but for government. The Treasury's forecasts of a 4.8 per cent growth in tax receipts - including money raked in from corporate tax and VAT on consumer goods - now looks wildly optimistic, yet revising them would threaten its spending plans for public services. So what happens when the sums no longer add up? </p> <p>If you are reading this on a Northern Line London Tube train, you may owe your journey to the last great recession. The extension of the Tube north to High Barnet and east into Essex in the 1930s was part of a massive programme of government spending designed to save jobs in construction and stimulate the economy after the Great Depression. </p> <p>Rather than balancing its books by slashing spending or hiking taxes, could Labour try to spend its way through the recession by unleashing another era of job-creating public works? </p> <p>Rail and bus operators are usually among the first casualties of rising unemployment, as redundant commuters tear up their season tickets. But Stephen Joseph, of the Campaign for Better Transport, argued the pain could be eased now by pushing ahead with expensive projects such as Crossrail. </p> <p>'Because of commitments in the transport sector some of the downturn won't be as bad, because there is a level of spending through the recession,' he said. The last few days have, he argues, seen an outbreak of cross-party Keynesianism with even the Tory Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, warning against halting investment. Similarly, ministers are being lobbied to snap up land at bargain prices as the property market crashes and use it to build social housing, keeping construction workers in jobs.</p> <p>The prospect of a spending spree funded by borrowing worries the Tories, who fear winning the next election only to pick up the bill for what the shadow cabinet minister Michael Gove calls a 'party on David Cameron's credit card'. </p> <p>This weekend, the shadow chancellor George Osborne published an analysis suggesting that, if government borrowing rises by \u00a340 billion to plug the gap caused by a shrinking economy, government debt will rise to \u00a380 billion by next year. By 2009-10, the government could be spending more on servicing debt than on grants to schools.</p> <p>Whitehall is tightening its belt ahead of a pre-budget report this autumn expected, as one Cabinet minister admits, to be 'very tough'. The Treasury has not yet even set a date for its publication, as Alistair Darling rips up plans left outdated by the global crisis. Downing Street has identified health, education and transport as priorities to be ringfenced but the outlook for other departments in the next three-year spending round - due to be settled next summer - appears grim. </p> <p>Discussions have already begun over the Queen's Speech, ditching planned legislation that does not address bread-and-butter issues. Ironically, one of the flagship bills was intended to be James Purnell's welfare reforms, bringing in private sector firms to find work for the jobless, details of which will be published in December. </p> <p>By then, if the gloomier forecasts are right, two million Britons could be needing the newly privatised Jobcentre services - but if Brown is vindicated, the economy could have stepped back from the brink. </p> <p>For millions whose homes and livelihoods depend on his economic stewardship, he was right yesterday to say the stakes could not be higher.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Tuesday October 14 2008.

  "<p>The volcanic archipelago studded off South America's Pacific coast is famous for unlikely creatures, big and small, which have evolved and thrived for millennia.</p> <p>Charles Darwin's observations on the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands inspired his theory of natural selection and turned the rocky outcrops into a symbol of adaptation and survival. Flightless cormorants, giant tortoises, blue-footed boobies and marine iguanas all found a niche in the lava-scarred landscape.</p> <p>And so, for a time, did a new arrival, a sub-set of the human species: the illegal migrant worker. For decades, thousands flocked from the impoverished Ecuadorean mainland and found jobs in the tourist industry as maids, waiters, cleaners and shop assistants.</p> <p>Now, however, the migrants are vanishing - targeted in an unprecedented Ecuadorean government crackdown intended to rein in a breakneck tourism boom and save the archipelago's unique ecology. </p> <p>Record numbers of tourist developments have threatened endangered plant and animal species and prompted Unesco, the United Nations' cultural agency, to place the Gal\u00e1pagos on its 'in danger list'. The influx is expected to swell for next year's 200th anniversary of the birth of Darwin, the Victorian naturalist whose 1859 book, On the Origin of Species, revolutionised scientific attitudes and human understanding. The mockingbirds he collected on the Gal\u00e1pagos and study of its tortoises played a crucial role in his thinking.</p> <p>Two centuries later, most of the islands' species have survived human settlement, but the authorities, after repeated warnings from environmentalists, have become alarmed and decided to crack down. But only on migrant workers, not the tourists.</p> <p>Checkpoints and patrols have been set up to catch illegal residents who are then marched on to aircraft and flown 600 miles east back to the mainland, the Gal\u00e1pagos's first such human culling.</p> <p>'It is a policy to send home all those who do not have legal status or the proper documentation,' said Carlos Macias, a spokesman for Ingala, the regional planning agency. 'We are enforcing the law.'</p> <p>Dozens have been bundled on to planes in recent weeks and 1,000 have returned to the mainland in the past year. Another 2,000 have been told to leave within 12 months. If they go, the permanent human population of 30,000 will have been decimated.</p> <p>However, there are no plans to curb the soaring number of tourists - mostly well-heeled Europeans and Americans who visit for a few days - which this year is set to reach 180,000. 'Of course the tourist numbers have an environmental impact, but we cannot forfeit the economic opportunity,' said Macias.</p> <p>The idea is to maintain the bonanza but lighten its environmental footprint by scaling back ancillary activities which require imported labour - a process of weeding out the poor to make room for the rich by government, as opposed to natural, selection. Environmentalists welcomed the initiative, but worried it did not go far enough. 'The system is currently broken, or certainly strained,' said Johannah Barry, president of the Gal\u00e1pagos Conservancy, an advocacy group formerly known as the Charles Darwin Foundation. 'The problem is not so much the number of tourists as the ancillary economy that's going up around it. It makes sense to limit the strain.'</p> <p>She criticised tourist packages which offered kayaking, horse-riding, scuba diving, deep-sea fishing and other activities which disrupted the eco-system. 'You can do those things in Hawaii; there is no reason to do them in the Gal\u00e1pagos.'</p> <p>What Darwin chronicled in 1835 - a living laboratory of endemic flora and fauna whose interactions helped explain evolution - has been disrupted not so much by stomping Homo sapiens as the invasive alien species which accompanied them: goats, cats, cattle, pigs, mosquitoes, fire ants. They challenge local habitats in ways nature never intended.</p> <p>Another culprit is oil leaking from vessels - notably the tanker Jessica which ran aground in 2001 - and over-fishing. Populations of sharks and sea cucumbers, a type of scavenger slug, have fallen. Scientists at Gal\u00e1pagos National Park have called for a cap on tourists, saying it is the only way to prevent further damage.</p> <p>In the 1970s, the archipelago was a sleepy, difficult to reach collection of 13 islands scattered over 45,000 square kilometres of equatorial water. A management plan which anticipated tourist interest posited the sustainable number of annual visitors at 12,000.</p> <p>Cruise ships and charter flights rendered that a quaint estimate. Numbers increased exponentially and successive governments welcomed the dollars. Annual revenue is now estimated at $200m, a significant inflow mostly pocketed by tax-paying airlines and tour operators on the mainland.</p> <p>Last month Ecuador's Environment Minister, Marcela Agui\u00f1aga, told the Los Angeles Times there was no sign that tourism was 'oversaturated'. President Rafael Correa, an outspoken leftwinger and self-proclaimed environmentalist, has acknowledged that the Gal\u00e1pagos are at risk and is trying to shake up the notoriously cumbersome and bureaucratic local government.</p> <p>It was apparently at Correa's prompting that Unesco visited the archipelago last year and placed it on its 'danger list', a decision upheld in July. The government says it is working on a new 'tourism model' to reconcile a continued tourism boom with environmental protection. Expelling illegal migrant workers is part of the new approach.</p> <p>Upon arrival all visitors are now given identity cards to help authorities keep track of movements and departures. Most migrant workers who are obliged to leave do so under their own steam and only a minority are frogmarched to the airport, said Macias, the state official. There are an estimated 6,000 undocumented workers, a fifth of the permanent population.</p> <p>Expulsions were a bold start, but further steps were needed to protect the archipelago's ecology, said Henry Nicholls, author of Lonesome George: The Life and Loves of a Conservation Icon, which chronicles the last known survivor of a species of Gal\u00e1pagos tortoise. 'Kicking people out is one thing, but it would also be sensible to put a cap on tourist numbers and to reform the tourist industry. Neither of those decisions is easy.'</p> <p>Such concerns have not discouraged tour operators from offering deals to coincide with the bicentennial of Darwin's birth. One is offering a yacht voyage to 'recreate something of the spirit of the Beagle', the Victorian naturalist's ship, and another is offering a chance to travel with Darwin's great-great-grandson. And in a nod to Anglo Saxon drinking tastes, the Rough Guide recommends the bars on Avenida Charles Darwin, a tourist hub on Isla Santa Cruz. 'A dedicated beer-swilling following brings a good atmosphere ... you can shoot pool, sip a blue-footed booby cocktail or relax in a hammock.'</p> <p>In 2009, however, there may be fewer migrant workers to serve you.</p> <h2>The Evolution of the Galapagos</h2> <p>\u2022 The Galapagos comprises six main islands, 12 smaller ones and more than<br>40 islets.</p> <p>\u2022 The islands lie 600 miles off the coast of Ecuador, at the Equator line.</p> <p>\u2022 The five inhabited islands have a population of between 30,000 and 40,000.</p> <p>\u2022 About 800 species of molluscs have been identified in the seas around the Galapagos islands, and about a fifth of those are found only there.</p> <p>\u2022 Part of the Galapagos is a wildlife sanctuary that is home to six species of giant tortoise and two species of large lizards. </p> <p>\u2022 More than 85 different species of birds live on the islands. </p> <p>\u2022 Fray Tomas de Berlanga, the Bishop of Panama, documented the first official visit to the islands in 1535.

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/politics/gordonbrown\">Gordon Brown</a> will try to broker a Europe-wide bail-out of <a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/business/banking\">banks</a> today modelled on Britain's <a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/politics/economy\">\u00a3500bn intervention</a>, warning that the 'stakes could not be higher' for jobs, mortgages and the future of the economy. </p> <p>The Prime Minister told The Observer that within days he would reveal how the bail-out would protect livelihoods in the UK by forcing the banks that accept government help to make money available to businesses and homeowners. One option is understood to be for the government to take seats on bank boards in return for taxpayers' cash. </p> <p>Brown said that the next few days would prove critical as the world tried to drag itself back from the financial brink after Friday's stock market panic wiped \u00a32.7 trillion off global share values. </p> <p>'The decisions that we take now will not just affect what happens in the next week or two but what happens in the next year or two,' said Brown, who flies to Paris for a meeting of eurozone ministers today. He will brief leaders from EU countries within the eurozone, from which Britain is usually excluded, on how his government's three-pronged strategy to buy stakes in banks, inject cash and kick-start lending could be copied across Europe in an unprecedented part-nationalisation of large parts of the global banking system. </p> <p>'I will say to people tomorrow that the stakes could not be higher,' he said yesterday. 'This is a moment of truth for the European economies, facing up to the challenges that are ahead.'</p> <p>Asked why, if his plan was working, the markets had crashed so spectacularly last week, the Prime Minister insisted that the British package was 'the right one', but added: 'Obviously it is going to work best if other countries are in a position to follow.'</p> <p>President George Bush pledged yesterday that the United States would follow Britain's lead by taking stakes in banks after the Wall Street giant Morgan Stanley appeared to be teetering on the brink of collapse. Dominique Strauss-Kahn, head of the International Monetary Fund, said yesterday that the banking crisis had pushed the global financial system 'to the brink of systemic meltdown'. </p> <p>Downing Street has insisted that success should not be judged by daily market movements, but all eyes will be on markets worldwide when the exchanges reopen tomorrow across Asia and Europe. The IMF warned leading indexes could fall by another 20 per cent before the crisis is over. </p> <p>Asked whether he had learnt lessons from the Great Depression, blamed on a failure by governments to respond adequately to the 1929 stock market crash, Brown said: 'I would put it more accurately that this is a failure in the banking system that has got to be corrected so that it doesn't have the major effects that people fear for the real economy. </p> <p>'I want people to know that we are doing everything we can to rectify the failures. Looking back to the lessons of the past, if you have a fundamental failure that has been exposed and you are now acting upon it, then that is the best [solution].'</p> <p>Brown also pledged to work with small businesses around the country to tackle their problems. He believes the speed with which the crisis has spread, with the banking failure in Iceland extending to hit council funding in Kent and small German savers, has underlined the way that globalisation has entwined nations' fates and made the case for international co-operation clearer.</p> <p>The Prime Minister will meet French President Nicolas Sarkozy, European Central Bank chief Jean-Claude Trichet, and European Commission President Jos\u00e9 Barroso this afternoon for talks before addressing the meeting of eurozone leaders. The Chancellor, Alistair Darling, held talks in Washington yesterday with President Bush as Treasury officials finalised details of which banks may take up the government offer of buying shares. A source said the Treasury could demand management changes in return for propping them up: 'Clearly, if you have a more significant stake, then you're going to have to think, from the point of view of protecting your interests, how you would take more control.' </p> <p>Darling said the threat from the banking crisis was 'blindingly obvious', adding: 'When people say why are you doing this for the banks, it is because it matters for everyone. It's about people's jobs, people's mortgages, people's businesses; it is about every man and woman in our country.' His words will be seen as failing to rule out wholesale nationalisation of the banks if the current proposals do not work.</p> <p>Senior Tories called for action to save jobs by limiting new employment rights and reducing red tape, in a shift away from David Cameron's support for measures such as more flexible working. </p> <p>Mark Prisk, the shadow business minister, attacked the government's decision to grant temporary and agency workers similar rights to permanent staff after 12 weeks in a job, arguing that this could be the last straw. 'This is just the wrong moment to start making things more complex and expensive. There are people out there now who if you start ratcheting up the costs of employment might just tip over the edge and start pushing more people into joblessness,' he said.</p> <p>Chris Grayling, the shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, said that the priority now was to save jobs: 'The fundamentals for business will be making ends meet and paying salary bills. The presumption over the next couple of years should be against new regulation and in favour of deregulation where we can.' </p> <p>Government aides, however, rejected the demands to scrap planned new employment rights. 'There is no way out of a recession by reducing people's rights at work,' declared a Downing Street source.</p>",
  "<p>In the GM crops dilemma, you propose that 'science, not fear' be the judge (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/05/gmcrops.food\">leader</a>, last week).

But GM is firmly in the hands of the type of people who gave us tobacco lies, asbestos lies and weapons-of-mass destruction lies - the type who sought to create wealth by genetically modifying the banks. Should we trust them when they no longer trust each other? <br><strong>Dermot Smyth</strong><br>Sheffield</p> <p>As much as I understand the sincerity of the motives of those who are against crop gene manipulation (CGM), their anxieties arise from misinformation about the science and the understanding of genetics. In most cases of genetic manipulation, particularly in the case of CGM in agriculture, scientists have done what nature has been doing for a few billion years. Most geneticists would agree that the risks of CGM in agriculture, if adequately regulated, are minimal and manageable.</p> <p>Many disagree with CGM in agriculture because of the involvement of corporations that have been aggressive in pursuing intellectual property rights or because of issues regarding 'termination seeds' which divests the control of raw materials from farmers to corporations. This is to conflate the issues of corporatisation and globalisation with CGM and hampers a necessary technology for addressing global food production and supply.<br><strong>Aamir Ahmed</strong><br>London N12</p> <p>You promote the acceptance of GM crops to save lives. This may be true in the short term. In the long term, the world needs fewer mouths to feed. Fewer mouths will make it easier to achieve each of the objectives for a more sustainable world - food, energy, fresh water, minerals. Achieving this requires political will and effective worldwide persuasion.<br><strong>John Chubb</strong><br>Cheltenham, Glos</p> <p>GM technology should not be released into the environment until proved to have no environmental and health risks. This stance is backed up by the Scottish Parliament's Health and Community Care committee report on the health impacts of GM crops, which argued that the basis for risk assessment is unsound. </p> <p>With regard to the developing world, a recent UN report found that GM crops offer no panacea to future food needs and do not increase yields.<br><strong>Brian Edwards</strong><br>Potters Bar, Herts</p> <p>The Soil Association has not misunderstood the science on the link between GM and allergic reactions, as Jay Rayner claimed (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/oct/05/gmcrops.food\">GM focus</a>, last week). The reason we gave for the allergen risk of GM foods was the presence of the new proteins produced by the inserted genes, something no one in the scientific community would dispute.</p> <p>The association between GM and allergic reactions is so well established that basic allergen testing is one of the few specific requirements of our flimsy regulatory process. Since the inserted genes usually come from other organisms such as bacteria, the proteins they produce are often new to the human diet. More worryingly, proteins that are safe when produced in some plants can become unexpectedly toxic when produced in others. GM is a risky technology that has no place in our food supply.<br><strong>Kathleen Hewlett </strong>, policy researcher<br>Soil Association, Bristol</p> <h2>Write to us</h2> <p>Letters, which may be edited, should include a full name and postal address and be sent to: Letters to the Editor, The Observer, 3-7 Herbal Hill, London EC1R 5EJ (to be received by noon Thursday). <strong>Fax: 020 7837 7817</strong>.

  "<p>Robert Mugabe yesterday attempted an 'ambush' on the power-sharing agreement in Zimbabwe by claiming all the key cabinet posts and control of the state security forces for his own party.</p> <p>In an open challenge to the power-sharing pact between the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) and the President's ruling Zanu-PF party, which have reached deadlock over the allocation of ministries, Mugabe made a typically defiant gesture by gazetting the 14 key ministries as having been allocated to Zanu-PF. </p> <p>In fact the negotiations of which posts go to which party are still undecided, although the number of posts that should be allocated to each party has been agreed, and the former South African president, Thabo Mbeki, has been asked back to Harare to attempt to resolve the impasse.</p> <p>Last night Mbeki's spokesperson, Mukoni Ratshitanga, confirmed to The Observer that the former president was heading to Zimbabwe determined to bring the country's warring parties together. 'Yes, there is a deadlock in Zimbabwe, but Mbeki is flying to Harare on Monday to make sure there is solution to the power-sharing deal,' he said.</p> <p>MDC spokesman Nelson Chamisa said the announcement of the posts by Zanu-PF was a 'midnight ambush style of attack' and meant the proposed national unity government was again in jeopardy. 'It shows that Mugabe thinks this thing is not about power-sharing but about power-grabbing. We reject the unilateral, contemptuous and barbaric ambush by Zanu-PF as an attempt to get the MDC into office but without power. We derive our legitimacy and mandate from the people of Zimbabwe, not Zanu-PF, who were rejected by the very same people in the 29 March elections.'</p> <p>Mbeki, chief mediator for the Southern African Development Community (SADC), now faces an even more uphill struggle. But Ratshitanga insisted that the former South African leader has been in contact with Mugabe, MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai and Arthur Mutambara, who heads a rival MDC faction. The trio met on Friday for more than an hour but little progress had been made apart from inviting Mbeki to return.</p> <p>Mugabe then took the step of unilaterally claiming both the security portfolios - defence and home affairs - which the MDC had insisted should be split. He also claimed foreign affairs, justice, media, mines and land. Last month Zanu-PF signed an agreement with the two MDC factions which stated that Mugabe's party would be granted 15 ministries, Tsvangirai'13 and Mutambara three.</p> <p>'What worsened the whole issue is Mugabe's refusal to share the cabinet posts equally,' said Chamisa. 'As MDC, we fear that if Mugabe allocates himself key ministerial posts such as defence, home affairs and justice, then chances are high that he might abuse the powers invested in him to purge those that viewed to be his enemies.</p> <p>'We need to move forward and address immediate problems such as hunger and reopening of companies as well as addressing education and health issues, but Mugabe is a stumbling block. We strongly believe that we should continue negotiations until we reach common ground.'</p> <p>On Friday Tsvangirai told journalists: 'We have declared a deadlock and therefore the process cannot move forward except in the presence of the facilitator [Mbeki].' Tsvangirai won the March presidential elections but according to disputed official figures he fell short of the necessary 51 per cent. A re-run in June became a one-man race after Tsvangirai withdrew, citing a wave of violence and murder being unleashed against his supporters.</p> <p>Zimbabwe's inflation is hovering above 231 million per cent and prices double every two to three days, compounded by acute food shortages and chronic disease rates. The World Food Programme has launched a new appeal for \u00a370m to help feed the country.</p>",
  "<p>Republican vice-presidential candidate <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/sarahpalin\">Sarah Palin</a> yesterday shrugged off the findings of a state inquiry into the 'Troopergate' affair, which concluded that she had used her position as governor to pursue a private feud with a State Trooper.</p> <p>Speaking at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, she remained defiant, insisting the inquiry outcome proved she had not broken the law. Shrugging her shoulders while addressing her audience, she said: 'If you read the report, you will see there was nothing unlawful... or unethical about replacing a cabinet member.'</p> <p>Her solicitor, Thomas Van Flein, said there was no evidence she had breached any ethical code. 'In order to violate the ethics law, there has to be some personal gain, usually financial. [The report] has failed to identify any financial gain.'</p> <p>However, an already tense US presidential election campaign was electrified by the publication of the damning verdict, delivered by Stephen Branchflower, a retired prosecutor who was appointed as investigator last July by a Republican-dominated committee of the Alaska state legislature. Branchflower found that Palin had breached the Alaska Executive Branch Ethics Act, which states that 'each public officer holds office as a public trust and any effort to benefit a personal or financial interest through official action is a violation of that trust'.</p> <p>He also concluded that Palin's feud with her former brother-in-law, Mike Wooten, a State Trooper, or officer, in the Alaskan state police, was 'likely a contributory factor' in her decision to dismiss the head of that force, Walt Monegan. His report detailed the way in which Palin and the people around her repeatedly pressurised Monegan over Wooten. However, Branchflower concluded that Monegan's dismissal had been carried out in a 'proper and lawful' fashion. Under Alaskan law, it is for the state's personnel board, which is conducting its own inquiry, to decide whether Palin violated state law and, if so, must refer it to the senate president for disciplinary action. Violations can carry a possible $5,000 fine.</p> <p>Meg Stapleton, a spokeswoman for the Republican Presidential candidate John McCain, said the legislative council was 'making a tortured argument to find fault without basis in law or fact'. A campaign statement said: 'This report also illustrates what we've known all along: this was a partisan-led inquiry run by [Barack] Obama supporters and the Palins were completely justified in their concern regarding Trooper Wooten given his violent and rogue behaviour.'</p> <p>The report could not have come at a less opportune time for the McCain campaign. According to the latest Gallup poll, published on Friday, he is trailing Barack Obama by 10 points, with 41 per cent to the Democrat's 51 per cent.</p> <p>Palin gave the McCain campaign an extraordinary boost after she first burst on to the American national scene at the Republican convention last month. Since then she has done little for his chances of success, with the polls suggesting many voters doubt she has the experience or ability for high office. Publication of the report is likely to fuel claims that McCain showed poor judgment, or even recklessness, in selecting her.</p> <p>Palin had agreed to co-operate with the inquiry, but when McCain selected her the following month she changed her mind, claiming the inquiry had been hijacked by Democrats. Palin has given a number of reasons for her decision to sack Monegan, but always denied wrongdoing. Shortly before the report was published, her husband Todd attempted to draw some of the investigation's fire by admitting that he had repeatedly complained about Wooten, believing him to be a danger to the public.</p> <p>In 2005, Wooten had been through an acrimonious divorce and custody battle with Palin's younger sister, Molly McCann. A number of complaints that the Palin family made about him at that time were upheld - including a charge that he had shot his own stepson with a Taser stun-gun on a low setting. In March 2006 he was disciplined, suspended for five days and given a final written warning, but allowed to keep his job.</p> <p>Palin came into office as governor of Alaska nine months later, and appointed Monegan as her public safety commissioner. Monegan says he immediately came under pressure to sack Wooten. He told Branchflower he was summoned to see Todd Palin, who complained that Wooten's punishment had been merely a 'slap on the wrist'. Monegan said: 'I had this kind of ominous feeling that I may not be long for this job if I didn't somehow respond accordingly.'</p> <p>A further finding of Branchflower's 263-page report was that the office of the Alaska state attorney-general, Talis Colberg, failed to comply with his request to release information about the case held in various emails. Some of these emails may now surface as a result of Friday's court case, shedding more light not only on Troopergate but also on the conduct of the politician who would, as American commentators repeatedly remind the voters, be just a heartbeat from the presidency were McCain elected.</p> <p>Palin is now known to have used at least two personal email accounts to conduct official business: gov.palin@yahoo.com and gov.sarah@yahoo.com. Both have now been shut down. The judge ordered the Alaskan attorney general to contact Yahoo and other private carriers to preserve any emails sent and received on those accounts. If the emails were ditched when the accounts were deactivated, he directed state officials to have the companies try to retrieve them.</p> <p>Freedom of information campaigner Andr\u00e9e McLeod, who brought the case, said: 'We shouldn't be in a position where public records have been lost because the governor didn't do what every other state employee knows to do, which is to use an official, secure state email account to conduct state business.'</p>",
  "<p>J\u00f6rg Haider, the populist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/thefarright\">rightwing</a> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/austria\">Austrian</a> politician notorious for his xenophobia and alleged Nazi sympathies, was killed yesterday in a road accident at the age of 58. </p> <p>Haider, the governor of the Austrian province of Carinthia and leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (AFA), was driving alone near the city of Klagenfurt. He died of severe head and chest injuries after his vehicle veered off the road as he attempted to overtake another car, doctors said. </p> <p>A spokesman for Haider's party said his death was 'like the end of the world' and pledged to 'keep his legacy alive'. Austrian Chancellor Alfred Gusenbauer described the maverick right-winger as someone who had shaped his nation's political landscape for decades.</p> <p>Political analysts said that the sudden death of Haider could lead to a new wave of support for the resurgent but divided Austrian right, which won 28 per cent of the vote in general elections last month. 'The right-wing bloc will now be able to unify around one leader,' said Robert Misik, a senior Austrian journalist and commentator. 'The charismatic Haider died the death of the James Dean of the Austrian political class, and that in itself will have significant consequences in the future.'</p> <p>Haider, the son of two Austrian Nazi sympathisers and a brilliant law student, was one of Europe's most controversial politicians. He based his career on a relatively explicit admiration for German National Socialism, aggressive Euroscepticism, persistent attacks on immigrants, and an instinctive ability to subtly but effectively tap into a long local history of anti-semitism. </p> <p>Using simple, provocative language, Haider, along with figures such as France's Jean-Marie Le Pen, was seen as one of the pioneers of the new European extreme-right populism of the past two decades. In 1991 he provoked fury after praising the 'orderly employment policy' of Nazi Germany, in 1995 he dismissed Nazi concentration camps as 'the punishment camps of National Socialism', and said that the Nazi Waffen-SS 'deserved every honour and recognition'. Haider's father volunteered for service with German armies on the eastern and western fronts during the Second World War. His parents were punished for their pro-Nazi activities by being forced to work in mundane jobs after the war.</p> <p>In 1999, after receiving 27 per cent of the vote in national elections, Haider's Freedom party was included in national government, earning Austria months of diplomatic isolation within the European Union. However, Haider, who always preferred the role of maverick populist outside the mainstream than the grit of day-to-day politics, ceded leadership of his party to a deputy. 'When it actually came to the final and boldest step into real power, his courage failed him,' said Misik. 'He was a complex personality, eccentric and borderline.'</p> <p>A multi-millionaire following the death of a rich landowner uncle who bequeathed him a huge estate controversially bought from an Italian Jew forced to flee Austria in 1940, Haider, always very popular in his home province of Carinthia, had toned down his rhetoric in recent years - though recent election posters in the town of Graz featured an immigrant beggar woman and the title 'Clean Up Graz'. </p> <p>In 2005 he broke away from the hard-right Freedom party, now led by his former prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Heinz-Christian Strache, to create the more moderate AFA. Despite the personal animosity of Haider and Strache, their two parties formed a right-wing bloc which did well in Austrian general elections last month, winning the same total as local Social Democrats. </p> <p>Strache, who has called for a ministry of deportation of immigrants, openly mocks homosexuals and has been filmed in forests carrying arms and wearing paramilitary fatigues in the company of banned German neo-Nazis, ran a virulently xenophobic campaign with slogans such as 'lights home for asylum cheats'. Yesterday Strache said Haider's death had deprived Austria of 'a great political figure'.</p>",
  "<p><strong>The following correction was printed in the Observer's For the record column, Sunday October 26 2008</strong></p> <p> The article below gave the impression that the army had decided to start court martial proceedings against a non-commissioned officer after an air strike killed three British troops in Afghanistan. We should clarify that the Army Prosecuting Authority is still considering the case and has yet to make a decision on whether to proceed with prosecution.</p> <p> </p> <p>As usual, the ambush was meticulously planned. Dozens of British troops took cover as Taliban fighters unleashed a stream of rocket-propelled grenades across the wadi. As the crossfire escalated, a forward controller ordered in US F-15 jets to bomb the well-fortified enemy positions. </p> <p>But even before the smoke had cleared, it was apparent that something had gone terribly wrong: the 500lb bomb had instead landed squarely on British positions, in a notorious 'friendly fire' tragedy that killed three UK troops. </p> <p>Initially, the US Air Force was castigated, then equipment failures were blamed. But, after a 12-month military investigation, a British soldier is facing a court martial after allegedly mistakenly guiding the warplane to bomb British positions. The sergeant faces charges of failing to perform a duty after investigators concluded he keyed in the wrong co-ordinates as British troops came under attack in Helmand province. </p> <p>Instead of bombing the enemy hundreds of yards away, the aircraft dropped the device on members of 1st Battalion the Royal Anglians. Privates Aaron McClure and Robert Foster, both 19, and John Thrumble, 21, died in the 'blue-on-blue' tragedy, the most serious friendly fire incident involving British and US military personnel since the 1991 Gulf war, when American A-10 tank-busting aircraft strafed a British convoy, killing nine soldiers.</p> <p>A report by the military's Special Investigation Branch, which was sent to the Army Prosecuting Authority, has found that the NCO supplied US commanders with an incorrect grid reference. Initially, the soldier had been warned he might face a charge of grossly negligent manslaughter, but last week potential charges were downgraded. </p> <p>Manchester-based law firm Hilary Meredith, which is representing Private Joshua Lee, 20, and Corporal Stuart Parker, 30, who sustained multiple injuries, including burns and deep lacerations, but survived the attack, said that for an NCO to be charged over the deaths constituted 'double standards'. </p> <p>Lawyers believe a degree of human error, even if it causes fatalities, must be accepted during the chaos of a close-range fight. Hilary Meredith said: 'If there was a claim by the family of a deceased, the Ministry of Defence would be protected by combat immunity because it happened in the heat of battle. Yet the military can prosecute a young sergeant for an incident that happened under the same conditions.'</p> <p>Patrick Mercer, Tory MP for Newark, has spoken to those injured by shrapnel from the bomb and said there was no resentment from any of the troops involved. 'I would hope that the pressures of battle are fully taken into account while making a judgment on this matter,' said the former commanding officer of the Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters. </p> <p>Evidence supplied by the Pentagon, including images from the cockpit of the F-15 and a full radio transmission of the conversation between the pilot and the British joint tactical air controller, indicated a single UK soldier was to blame. </p> <p>Findings from an army board of inquiry may prompt the MoD to create a system whereby co-ordinates given by controllers on the ground are verified repeatedly before they are acted upon. </p> <p>Last year's attack happened as 60 soldiers from the regiment carried out a routine patrol shortly before dusk from their remote base near Kajaki, in northern Helmand. The men were to infiltrate Taliban-held territory and help establish security around a strategically vital hydroelectric dam, being renovated to provide electricity for the province. </p> <p>Footage taken from a soldier's helmet camera revealed how men from the Royal Anglians were ambushed in twilight as Taliban fighters opened fire. As the firefight intensified, a joint tactical air controller called in a US air strike. </p> <p>Colleagues nearby watched in shock as the bomb fell short. Grainy images from the helmet camera reveal the ferocity of the blast as British troops crouch from the explosion's force. At the time of the attack, Nato had banned the use of 500lb bombs in Helmand because of their destructive capability in built-up areas; in this instance, the bomb's impact was so powerful it blew the helmets and trousers off those crouching close by. </p> <p>The three soldiers were killed instantly. Lee and Parker were given first aid before being flown by a Chinook helicopter to the army's main base at Camp Bastion, an hour's flight south.</p>",
  "<p>In the week of the crash in 1929, Wall Street fell by 23 per cent. Last week, it fell by 18 per cent, London and Frankfurt by 21 per cent and Japan's Nikkei by 24 per cent. Every major financial centre's interbank market is frozen. Trust and confidence have collapsed; the global system is paralysed on a scale that now surpasses 1929. There is a combination of a worldwide bank run, seizure of credit markets and collapse of asset values that could plunge the globe into a depression. This is history's joke: the crisis of capitalism long predicted by communists and socialists who are no longer able to take advantage of it.</p> <p>The scale of what is happening is scarcely credible. On Wednesday morning, the UK government committed itself to an unparalleled \u00a3500bn of extra support for Britain's paralysed financial system - up to \u00a350bn of capital, guarantees for \u00a3250bn of lending between banks and additional injections of cash. This is the biggest, most comprehensive and best-thought-through operation of its kind mounted by any Western government since 1945. It was rewarded for its pains by a further 10 per cent fall in stock market prices, a further freezing of the already crisis-stricken interbank markets and, most ominously of all, the beginnings of a run on sterling.</p> <p>One government can do so much; the British plan was simply swept to one side by what is now a financial pandemic which only a global response can address. G7 finance ministers, at last jointly aware of the gravity of the crisis, attempted to produce such a response in their five-point plan announced at the meeting of the IMF and World Bank in Washington on Friday night. </p> <p>The proposals are distressingly broad brush and hardly add to the markets' knowledge. It is no longer news that governments do not intend to let a major bank fail, nor that they will protect depositors, inject capital from taxpayers, free up liquidity and do whatever is necessary to keep the system going. At best, I fear it will temporarily hold the line; at worst, it will be ignored as platitudinous.</p> <p>The problem is that the markets no longer have any faith that the world financial system they helped create has any future. The model is bust. It is encouraging that both the Americans and Germans are now moving towards what they considered ideologically unthinkable a fortnight ago - they are preparing to follow the British lead, take big public stakes in banks and offer guarantees to the interbank market.</p> <p>But while this is a necessary condition for stabilisation it is not sufficient. What needs to happen on top is an assault on the dark heart of the global financial system - the $55 trillion market in credit derivatives and, in particular, credit default swaps, the mechanisms routinely used to insure banks against losses on risky investments. This is a market more than twice the size of the combined GDP of the US, Japan and the EU. Until it is cleaned up and the toxic threat it poses is removed, the pandemic will continue. Even nationalised banks, and the countries standing behind them, could be overwhelmed by the scale of the losses now emerging.</p> <p>This market in credit derivatives has grown explosively over the last decade largely in response to the $10 trillion market in securitised assets - the packaging up of income from a huge variety of sources (office rents, port charges, mortgage payments, sport stadiums) and its subsequent sale as a 'security' to be traded between banks. </p> <p>Plainly, these securities are risky, so the markets invented a system of insurance. A buyer of a securitised bond can purchase what is in effect an insurance contract that will protect him or her against default - a credit default swap (CDS). But unlike the comprehensive insurance contract on your car which you have with one insurance company, these credit default contracts can be freely bought and sold. Complex mathematical models are continually assessing the risk and comparing it to market prices. If the risk falls, the CDSs are cheap; if the risk rises - because, say, a credit rating agency declares the issuing company is less solid - the price rises. Hedge funds speculate in them wildly.</p> <p>Their purpose was a market solution to make securitisation less risky; in fact, they make it more risky, as we are now witnessing. The collapse of Lehman Brothers - the refusal to bail it out has had cataclysmic consequences - means that it can no longer honour $110bn of bonds, nor $440bn of CDSs it had written. On Friday, the dud contracts were auctioned, with buyers paying a paltry eight cents for every dollar. Put another way, there is now a $414bn hole which somebody holding these contracts has to honour. And if your head is spinning now, add the three bust Icelandic banks. They can no longer honour more than $50bn of bonds, nor a mind-boggling $200bn of CDSs.</p> <p>The implications are global. The UK government might have frozen Icelandic assets in Britain to get some compensation for the losses, but we are only part of the story. Austrian, Danish and Finnish banks all hold near valueless Icelandic bonds on which they will have bought CDSs from heaven knows whom - Deutsche Bank? A two-bit hedge fund in Dubai? Lehman Brother? Kaupthing? Shareholders in Barclays and RBS are rightly concerned; the two banks hold a stunning $2.4 trillion of CDSs each - more than the UK's GDP.</p> <p>We don't know their exposure to Iceland and Lehman Brothers, but with such enormous credit derivative books it would be amazing if there were none. While every bank tries to pass the toxic parcel on to somebody else, the system has to find the money. So will compensation for the near valueless contracts and thus now uninsured debt ultimately be made - and by whom? And because nobody knows - not the regulators, banks or governments - who owns the swaps and whether they are credit-worthy, nobody can answer the question. Maybe holders of insurance policies will get the cash due to them, but will that weaken somebody else? The result - panic.</p> <p>This is the ultra-dangerous downward vortex in which the system is locked. It is why share prices are plummeting. As recession deepens, there will be defaults on securitised bonds and the potential collapse of more banks outside the G7 ring-fence. Nobody knows what proportion of the $55 trillion of credit default contracts that have actually been written will be honoured and who might bear losses running into trillions of dollars. Buying new contracts to insure against default has become prohibitively expensive. Securitisation, and insuring against risk, has effectively ceased. And because the markets don't know where the losses will fall, banks cannot borrow from each other except overnight or from their central bank. Credit flows are at a standstill. Property prices are plummeting. A famous economist, Hyman Minsky, foretold that unregulated finance capitalism inevitably ends in a meltdown and slump. The world is facing a Minsky moment.</p> <p>One element of the necessary response is in the making - giving banks access to unlimited taxpayers' capital, guaranteeing interbank lending and pumping cash into the system. I suspect that only majority government control of the West's major banks will now stabilise matters. But that is not enough. The markets no longer believe in the financial market structures they have invented. As a result, the US Fed, the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan and Bank of England must become not just lenders, but insurers of last resort, providing the insurance contracts that the markets have stopped. Governments must write CDSs themselves. </p> <p>In future, the global credit derivative markets will need to be organised into regulated, licensed exchanges rather than conducted in a way that made the Wild West look tame. We will need a global authority to supervise the credit derivative markets, write insurance contracts and stand ready to guarantee that contracts are settled. And we will need a global, independent credit rating agency to assess risk objectively. More immediately, there needs to be deep co-ordinated cuts in interest rates; last week's half per cent cut was useful but inadequate.</p> <p>I don't know whether politicians and their advisers can move as quickly as they need in so many areas and collaborate across so many countries to restore stability. Most of those who should be leading the world's recovery are, politically speaking, numbered among the politically walking wounded or dead; either near the end of office like George Bush, in a fractious coalition like Angela Merkel, or leading a dysfunctional party like the weak Taro Aso of Japan. </p> <p>Without collaboration and leadership, we face disaster. On Friday, there were terrifying signs that the contagion was spreading to the foreign exchange markets: for example, the Australian dollar dived 20 per cent against the yen over the week; sterling fell 3 per cent against the dollar. If investors start to think that politicians cannot control the situation and the necessary international action falls short of what is required, then Britain has got neither the GDP nor financial firepower to support the scale of capital flight and financial losses that will hit the City of London. </p> <p>The pound could fall at least the 30 to 40 per cent that currencies fell during the Asian financial crisis. London could become the centre of the rout. If so, it will not just be complete nationalisation of the banks we will be considering but the reimposition of capital and exchange controls.</p> <p>For 30 years, greedy, callow, ignorant financiers, supported by no less callow politicians from all the political parties, have proclaimed the wonders of financial innovation and how proud we all should be of the City of London. The price tag for their behaviour is an economic calamity. We should never have bought such snake oil. The consolation in these dark times is that we never will again.</p>",
  "<p>The kind of booing that followed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/scotland\">Scotland's</a> performance here is the most articulate expression of the widespread belief that failure to beat <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/norway\">Norway</a> at home has probably damaged George Burley's team's prospects of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/worldcup2010qualifiers\">World Cup qualification</a> beyond repair. Burley himself had insisted in the days before the game that anything less than victory would 'put us in a very difficult position' and what he saw during the 90 minutes is unlikely to have caused him to change his mind.</p> <p>Even if the substitute Chris Iwelumo will be remembered for an astounding second-half miss on his international debut, no one could argue that the visitors did not deserve at least a point.</p> <p>'It's one of those things where if you mishit it or mis-control it, it could go in,' said Burley of his debutant's miss. 'It didn't go in, but he showed he can play at this level and gave them a lot of problems. I thought in the second half we upped the tempo, changed it around and were in the ascendancy. We had a number of chances, but couldn't get that goal. '</p> <p>Expectations of a close contest were never likely to be confounded by rivals whose contrasting styles might have been specifically designed to produce a deadlock. Not quite a case of the irresistible force meeting the immovable object - neither deserved such a distinction - but the Scots' open, short-passing surges and the Norwegians' crowding, stoical defensiveness from middle to back meant long periods of mutual nullification.</p> <p>The exception, predictably, would be Shaun Maloney, buzzing past would-be obstructions on the left, and John Carew, the maverick man-mountain allowed by his coach, Age Hareide, to maraud at will as the visitors' lone striker.</p> <p>On those occasions when he simply burst clear of 'markers', the towering Aston Villa forward was frequently the most dangerous player on the field, the timing of his runs as noticeable and as disconcerting a feature as his pace.</p> <p>His entry into the game was a one-two with Bjorn Helge Riise and a burst between Gary Caldwell and David Weir, the Scotland defenders, and a clear path towards Craig Gordon before Gary Naysmith came across quickly from the left-back position to make enough contact with the ball to cause Carew to screw the shot wide of the left post.</p> <p>With Maloney and James Morrison supporting James McFadden in attack, Scott Brown in the holding role in midfield and Darren Fletcher and Barry Robson thrusting forward whenever possible, there was no shortage of skirmishing by the Scots in the visitors' half. But they predictably struggled to beating the tall Norwegian defenders in the air.</p> <p>Tellingly, it was Fletcher's cute pass to Morrison, releasing the West Brom man into space on the right side of the penalty area, which brought the home side their most dangerous attack before the interval. Morrison's low centre towards McFadden, however, was pulled a little behind the striker and the chance went.</p> <p>Burley waited only 11 minutes in the second half before conceding that his strategy was not producing, by replacing McFadden and Morrison with two recognised strikers, Iwelumo and Steven Fletcher, and reverting to a 4-4-2, with Maloney and Robson on the flanks.</p> <p>The 6ft 4in Iwelumo was at least expected to be a physical match for the Norwegians, but no one could have anticipated the miss by the Wolves striker nine minutes after he had taken the field. It was the kind of opportunity the Scots had looked unlikely to create.</p> <p>Brown fought to win possession on the left and his short pass allowed Naysmith to drive into the penalty area. From there, the left-back's low centre eliminated the entire Norway defence, including goalkeeper John Knudsen, and Iwelumo, staggeringly, contrived to side-foot the shot from four yards wide of the unprotected net.</p> <p>Iwelumo could not disguise his disappointment after the match. 'I'm obviously gutted,' he said. 'I had a big chance and I should put them away, so I'm disappointed. I just have to bounce back and keep positive. I'm my own worst critic and it's definitely something I'll be thinking about. But I'm a big character and I'll take that one on the chin and move on.'</p> <p>It was a moment that overshadowed the earlier profligacy by Norway defender Kjetil Waehler, who had met John Arne Riise's corner without a challenge and sent a header from six yards into the outside of the net. The miss was so surprising that it took a few seconds for the home fans to realise the match was still scoreless.</p> <p>It was, by the finish, a small miracle that it should remain so, Steffen Iversen having driven the ball against Gordon and Naysmith having put himself in the way of the follow-up drive from Daniel Braaten. Along with Iwelumo's aberration, these incidents seemed to confirm that the match was destined to end as it had begun.</p>",
  "<p>With 20 minutes to go and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/england\">England</a> leading the enterprising opponents from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/kazakhstan\">Kazakhstan</a> by a wafer-thin 2-1 margin, there was a shocking moment when the team ranked 131st in the world looked on course to dismantle all the jubilation that Fabio Capello's side brought home with them from Croatia last month. </p> <p>Yet England wake up this morning on the right end of a convincing scoreline, thanks in no small part to the fact that the visitors completely ran out of puff as the game reached its latter stages. Suddenly they were ripe for picking off, and Wayne Rooney and Jermain Defoe guaranteed there could be no reproach. Five goals, in even stronger control of Group Six after Croatia drew 0-0 with Ukraine - what more do they want?</p> <p>There are still causes for concern, however. Until the late goalfest, the brave new world produced by Zagreb had descended into the same old shambles at Wembley, as England looked pedestrian, struggled for ideas and required the safety net of the set piece to make any kind of inroads at all.</p> <p>So much for the new no-boo ambience here. It summed up a strange affair, where the mood was warm and cheerful at the beginning and end, but a few brickbats were thrown in between. The chief recipient was Ashley Cole, whose culpability for Kazakhstan's goal was undeniable - even if Capello later expressed his discontent that the England fans could boo 'Ashley Young'. 'Anyone can make a mistake,' he said of the Ashleys. Indeed.</p> <p>Fortunately any mistakes made on this occasion proved not particularly costly. But England's capacity to disappoint remains a stubborn part of this team's make-up. A forgettable first 45 minutes managed to deflate the early optimism and allow for some discontented jeers as the players walked off goalless at half-time. It was a timely reminder that a spectacular win in Croatia, in isolation, does not a revolution make.</p> <p>Even though Capello trotted out the old clich\u00e9s about it being difficult to break down small teams geared towards damage limitation, the words rang hollow. Kazakhstan's players certainly did not, as caretaker coach Bernd Storck had warned against so vigorously, approach this fixture as a glamorous shirt-swapping exercise. They were not overly defensive, either, playing two up front and maintaining a decent shape.</p> <p>Kazakhstan also possessed the most exciting player on the pitch in debutant Tanat Nusserbayev, who outshone his fellow No 7 Theo Walcott, even though England's new wonderboy did offer some exciting glimmers.</p> <p>Walcott tried to assert England's cause with a twinkling dribble and curling shot early on that sailed a little high and wide. Long-range shots seemed to be the order of the day and Frank Lampard whacked a stanchion hard enough for one of the visiting journalists to shriek so zanily in the press box that you could not help wondering if she had been sent as Borat's revenge.</p> <p>What noise Borat's revenge would have made two minutes into the second half had Kazakhstan gone ahead is anybody's guess. But it was mighty close, as Wes Brown missed Sabrykhan Ibrayev's cross and Sergey Ostapenko knocked the ball down for Nusserbayev, who had the goal at his mercy. To the Kazakhstan striker's dismay, and England's mighty relief, he slashed the chance over.</p> <p>The scoreline was tilted almost immediately, as England profited from a corner. Lampard's delivery was whipped into the heart of the penalty area, and with goalkeeper Alexandr Mokin stranded after he ran out to punch but never got near the ball, Rio Ferdinand nodded in. He celebrated as a captain should, with fists pumped and a bloody good yell. Ferdinand knew how things were going and how critical it was for England not to go too far backwards so soon after the euphoria of Zagreb.</p> <p>Kazakhstan showed the spirit to respond, as the effervescent Nusserbayev came close again with a fierce shot that David James in the England goal parried.</p> <p>It took a while for the home side to settle into a more encouraging rhythm after Capello had introduced Shaun Wright-Phillips for Gareth Barry at half-time to switch to a more conventional 4-4-2 formation.</p> <p>Like all his predecessors, Capello is finding it hard to accommodate Lampard and Steven Gerrard, but the Italian expressed himself satisfied with the way the midfield partnership improved. However, the problem has not disappeared yet, clearly. Capello may learn a little more about the risks if he selects both for England for a tougher fixture in Belarus on Wednesday night.</p> <p>Just after the hour, England appeared to make the game safe courtesy of another set piece, as Alexandr Kuchma headed Lampard's free-kick past Mokin under pressure from Rooney.</p> <p>Game over? Not quite. Complacency reared its ugly head again for England as Cole's excruciating back-pass landed perfectly for Zhambyl Kukeyev to steer confidently past James for his first ever international goal.</p> <p>As Kazakhstan chased the equaliser, England picked their pockets at the back, with Walcott carving an opening for Rooney to head in, this time unmarked. The Manchester United forward slotted in his second four minutes from the end - surprise, surprise from another dead ball, this one manufactured by cameo substitute David Beckham.</p> <p>Fellow sub Jermain Defoe gave the scoreline gloss in added time as the Kazakhs succumbed to cramp.</p> <p>Although Capello criticised England's fans for giving Cole such treatment, he did praise them for 'being very strong for us' while England struggled to find their gear. There wasn't a hint of a boo at full-time. </p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/england\">England</a> captain <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/rio-ferdinand\">Rio Ferdinand</a> branded fans who booed Ashley Cole 'immature and ignorant' after the Chelsea left-back made a clumsy mistake that allowed Kazakhstan to score before Fabio Capello's team ended with an easy 5-1 victory at Wembley in a match in which David Beckham, on as 78th-minute substitute, won his 106th cap to equal Sir Bobby Charlton's tally.</p> <p>Following a victory that gives England a maximum nine points from the opening three games and control of Group Six - after Ukraine and Croatia drew - in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/worldcup2010qualifiers\">qualification for the 2010 World Cup</a>, the head coach echoed Ferdinand's disappointment. 'I don't understand why the crowd boo one player,' the Italian said. 'You have to help the players more when they make a mistake. But the crowd was very strong for us. After the first half, they helped us a lot.'</p> <p>Cole's pass back across the England defence was collected by Zhambyl Kukeyev in the 68th minute. He then calmly advanced and made the score 2-1, to give his side hope of a fightback against an England team who had been lacklustre following a bright opening 20 minutes. 'It's disappointing when any player makes a mistake,' said Ferdinand, who led England for the second time because of John Terry's back injury and scored the first goal. 'You want to get behind him and gee him up, so he gets back into it. I hope the people who've done that will feel a bit ashamed when they get home think about it. The majority of fans were great and it's up to us as players to create that relationship again with them by making Wembley a cauldron. It's up to us a little bit, and the fans to get behind us.'</p> <p>Capello said Terry may be back in three days' time, when the team go to Minsk to play Belarus. 'I hope he will be OK. Belarus are a good team. I saw them play against Ukraine - they are dangerous. It will be a dangerous game.'</p>",
  "<p>Critics called him the \"yuppie fascist\". But J\u00f6rg Haider, who died today in a car accident, aged 58, was notoriously difficult to pin down. He always denied links to the extreme right, despite praising Nazi policies. He built a successful political career by stoking up fears about immigration in Austria. </p> <p>Freidrich Peter, a former SS officer and Haider's predecessor as leader of Austria's Freedom party, once said of him: \"This man is a rep who can sell any product.\"</p> <p>Haider transformed Freedom from a fringe movement to a mainstream party. When he took over as leader in 1986, it could barely muster 5% of the vote. By 2000, it had secured enough votes to form part of a governing coalition.</p> <p>\"Every popular opinion finds a home with him,\" said his biographer, Christa Zoechling, in 1999. \"He likes to see himself as a victim of circumstance. At one time or another he said that he feels he has been treated like a Kurd, a Palestinian, or even a Jew.''<br> Haider was born in Bad Goisern, Upper Austria. His father was a shoemaker and a former Nazi stormtrooper. His mother was a trained teacher and a former Hitler Youth leader. They joined the Nazi party in 1929, when it was illegal.</p> <p>After the war his parents were officially ostracised and allowed to do only manual jobs. They claimed they were treated unfairly. This sense of injustice was said to have been highly influential for the young Haider. He built a political career championing the downtrodden.</p> <p>He went on to controversially inherit a fortune from his great-uncle, William Webhofer, and developed a taste for skiing and sharp suits. His rich relation had bought a 1,600-hectare estate at a knock-down price from its Jewish owner in 1939. By the time Heider inherited it, it was worth millions. </p> <p>Haider excelled at school. At the age of 16 he won debating contest on whether Austrians were Germans. He went on to study law in Vienna, where he joined nationalist groups committed to a Greater Germany. One friend claimed he used to practise fencing using a straw doll on which he had pinned the name of the Nazi-hunter Simon Wiesenthal.</p> <p>In 1976, Haider joined the right-wing Freedom party and became party secretary in the province of Carinthia, which became his political power base. In 1986, he overthrow Freedom's liberal wing to become party leader. Three years later he was elected governor of Carinthia 1989.</p> <p>In the 1990s he made a number of remarks about the Nazis from which he would later distance himself. When he praised the \"orderly employment policies\" of the Third Reich, he was forced to resign as governor. Later, he referred to concentration camps as Nazi penal camps.</p> <p>By 1999, he had toned down such rhetoric and got 27% of the vote in national elections. During the campaign, Haider successfully exploited concerns about immigration and resentment about the growing power of the European Union. His party's subsequent inclusion in the government led to months of EU sanctions.</p> <p>In 2000, he resigned as leader of the Freedom party when it entered a coalition with the conservative People's party. Two years later, Haider made a controversial trip to the UK to promote tourism to Carinthia. Anti-Nazi demonstrators protested outside a London hotel where he hosted a conference.</p> <p>Haider broke away from Freedom altogether in 2005 to form the more moderate Alliance for the Future. This summer, he staged a political comeback to help the alliance improve its standing in national elections two weeks ago. </p> <p>Last week, Haider and Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom party, met for what appeared to be a successful attempt to put aside their personal differences in light of their combined success at the polls. Taken together, the results of their two parties came to 28.2% of the ballot, putting them on nearly equal footing with the winning Social Democrats.</p> <p>Strache led tributes to his former mentor, saying: \"With his passing, Austria has lost a great political figure.\"</p> <p>Haider is survived by his wife, two daughters and his mother, whose 90th birthday he and his family had planned to celebrate over the weekend.</p>",
  "<p>Liam Clarke <a href=\"http://www.newsletter.co.uk/columnists/SF-and-DUP-must-sort.4563365.jp\" title=\"argues in the Newsletter\">argues in the Belfast News Letter</a> that no one should intervene to clear up the mess over <a href=\"http://sluggerotoole.com/index.php/weblog/comments/sinn-fein-blocks-another-executive-meeting/\">the failure</a> of the office of first minister and deputy first minister to sort out their differences sufficiently to clear the way for the executive to meet. </p> <p>It was the one thing I was asked about over and over during the pre-publicity interviews (and from neighbours and friends on the street) on the <a href=\"http://sluggerotoole.com/index.php/weblog/comments/slugger-awards-final-round-up/\">Slugger Awards</a> (on which there's a report <a href=\"http://alaninbelfast.blogspot.com/2008/10/slugger-awards-for-wee-guy-and-big.html\">here</a> and podcast <a href=\"http://davidsims.blogsome.com/2008/10/07/digital-circle-podcast-07-slugger-awards/\">here</a>). Clarke:</p> <blockquote> <p>The extent of the mess is revealed by the fact that, in the midst of a world economic crisis which is now openly compared to the 30s, our local executive doesn't even meet to discuss it. While governments across the world are taking hard decisions, our leaders are locked in a blame game over such momentous issues as when policing and justice powers can be devolved.</p> </blockquote> <p>He picks up on the mildly <a href=\"http://www.sinnfein.ie/gaelic/news/detail/35569\" title=\"apocalyptic tone\">apocalyptic tone</a> from Martin McGuinness in Derry at the weekend, which was unusual for the deputy first minister, if not for his senior party colleague Gerry Adams:</p> <blockquote> <p>If partnership government is beyond the DUP then it will fall to the two governments to take the necessary decisions and implement the necessary policy changes to ensure political progress in the all-Ireland context envisaged in the Good Friday And St Andrews agreements.</p> </blockquote> <p>Clarke again:</p> <blockquote> <p>It is precisely the language he used about David Trimble and the Ulster Unionists when he prepared for the dissolution of the last power-sharing arrangement. It is the sort of language you use when you are preparing for breakdown and an election and are trying to get nationalists to rally behind you. It is also the sort of language a child uses when trying to appeal to a parent for help. </p> </blockquote> <p>He also notes that the party is rolling out a campaign to pin the blame for this mess entirely on the DUP, with Adams in Cleveland, Ohio saying there were some in the DUP who were \"bigots; who really don't want to have a Catholic about the place. They are opposed to power-sharing in any form.\"</p> <p>Sinn F\u00e9in is trying for a renegotiation of terms they were prepared to settle for just two years ago, and warned others that they should not interfere with just over a year back. There is clearly also considerable frustration at the DUP's repeated application of their triple-lock mechanism on any substantial change in Sinn F\u00e9in's direction.</p> <p>No one claims to want a collapse, but that doesn't mean there won't be one. The principles of the devolution of policing and justice were conceded by all parties in the St Andrews agreement. And more recently the modalities of how that might happen were agreed in early August. Only the issue of timing remains to be dealt with. </p> <p>But the DUP is talking tough on that, saying that they have made a manifesto promise to their supporters to retain control of the timing of that decision. Critics say it shows the party is incapable of providing leadership, or lacking sufficient generosity to allow Sinn F\u00e9ein to at least win some of its critical battles.</p> <p>It is doubtful that the devolution of limited policing powers is a huge question for many nationalists, but the fundamentalist base of its activists having an English (as opposed to a local) minister in charge of policing is intolerable. It's also thought the party is taking some local heat on the leadership's apparent inability to fulfil promises made to the special Ard Fheis in early 2007.</p> <p>In the meantime, politics in Northern Ireland is being slowly strangled by Sinn F\u00e9in's \"<a href=\"http://sluggerotoole.com/index.php/weblog/comments/sinn-fein-blocks-another-executive-meeting/\">civil protest action</a>\" inside the highest office of the administration. It remains to be seen who will blink first.</p>",
  "<p>I <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/kenlivingstone\">have argued in the Guardian</a> and <a href=\"http://socialisteconomicbulletin.blogspot.com/\">Socialist Economic Bulletin</a> that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/10/marketturmoil-creditcrunch\">international financial crisis</a> is on such an historic scale that only action that measures up to its colossal proportions has any chance of being effective. Unfortunately, every day confirms this reality. This crisis is rooted in a severe historical overvaluation of assets in the US. As these assets are revalued downwards, to their internationally competitive levels, they destroy the balance sheets of all institutions holding them \u2013 as is indeed occurring. </p> <p>The losses involved in this will be many trillions of dollars: losses on US mortgages are several trillion dollars and losses on US shares are already $8.4tn. All financial institutions that have been significantly linked indirectly to such losses will be overwhelmed by the fallout from this. Compared to the scales of losses, measured in trillions, which are involved in this process the \u00a350bn the British government has proposed to use for the purchase of shares in UK banks is insignificant \u2013 it is equivalent to attacking a tank with a machine gun. The bullets will simply bounce off. This sum will be overwhelmed by the downward pressure on asset prices originating in the US and spreading through the world economy. A substantial part of this \u00a350bn of risks being lost. </p> <p>Indeed, the reason that the government has had to consider making such a capital injection is clear: because private investors will not risk their money in doing so. And they have good reason not to. Those investors who put \u00a312bn into Royal Bank of Scotland and \u00a34bn into HBOS this year have suffered very severe losses. </p> <p>If it had been the taxpayer that had made this investment, the taxpayer would equally have made such severe losses. The downward movement of asset prices in the US has not yet run its course \u2013 that is, asset deflation has not yet ended. Any injection of taxpayers' money into British banks in such a situation runs grave risk of being lost. </p> <p>However, while it is incapable of affecting the movements of trillions of dollars that are moving the present international financial crisis, that \u00a350bn is a large sum compared to the scale of UK public spending, or the sums that may be needed to protect individual savers. It is therefore essential that this \u00a350bn is not wasted in a bank \"recapitalisation\" programme, which the basic economic arithmetic shows cannot succeed. </p> <p>To take an analogy from war, Churchill in 1940 had to take a grave decision for which he is still condemned by many in France. France requested that to attempt to stem the German advance the RAF, including forces vital to the defence of the UK, be totally committed to this battle. If Churchill had taken that decision, the RAF would potentially have suffered such losses it would not have been able to fight the Battle of Britain. Churchill took the strong and vital decision not to do so. It was necessary to prevent the weakening of the RAF in a hopeless battle and conserve its resources to win the decisive Battle of Britain. </p> <p>That is why \u00a350bn of taxpayers' money must not be committed to a battle to recapitalise banks which involves wholly unacceptable risk. Instead, news <a href=\"http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/economics/article4922053.ece\">published in the Times on Friday evening</a> showed the right way forward: \"As the Treasury was set to reveal details of the British bail-out plan, sources at the IMF warned that, if this failed, then the only option would be the wholesale nationalisation of the British banking system.\" This was adjusted in later editions to read \"officials gathered in Washington were forced to contemplate the previously unthinkable: that Britain's enfeebled banks may face outright nationalization.\"</p> <p>This nationalisation of a number of major British banks should be carried out immediately. Some banks, notably HSBC, are able to raise private capital, if they require, to strengthen their balance sheet and should be allowed to do so. A number of others led by Royal Bank of Scotland, HBOS and possibly Lloyds TSB cannot \u2013 it is clear that the greatest financial strain now exists on the proposed takeover of HBOS by Lloyd's TSB. </p> <p>Those banks that prove unable to raise private capital should be nationalised. But public taxpayers' money must not be risked in purchasing bank shares when the private sector refuses to do so. Such nationalisations would allow the kickstarting of bank lending \u2013 which the further rise in interbank lending rates on Friday confirmed will not be achieved by present proposals. </p> <p>As the <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article4916344.ece\">prime minister wrote in the Times on Friday</a>: \"The banking system is fundamental to everything we do. Every family and every business in Britain depends upon it. ... The role of banks is to circulate the savings from deposits, our pensions and from companies to those that need to spend or invest them. The cost at which banks can borrow this money directly affects the costs of mortgages for homeowners and of lending for business. This paralysis of lending from loss of confidence jeopardises the flow of money to every family and every business in the country.\"</p> <p>Indeed, it goes without saying that the British economy cannot operate without a functioning banking system. The strongest possible banking system would be to proceed to create a strong nationalised banking sector, which will be able to restart lending. </p> <p>For this reason, the government should set on one side its initial package, which is rapidly being superseded by events, and which carries unacceptable risk to the taxpayer, and proceed immediately to the nationalisation of those British banks unable to raise private capital as the most decisive way to strengthen their balance sheets and resume lending.</p>",

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/johnmccain\">John McCain</a>'s election campaign last night suffered the body blow that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/republicans\">Republicans</a> had been bracing themselves for when his vice-presidential candidate, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/sarahpalin\">Sarah Palin</a>, was found to have abused her powers in pursuit of a personal feud against her former brother-in-law.</p> <p>At the conclusion of the ten-week investigation into the so-called Troopergate affair, Palin was found to have breached the ethics rules that govern her conduct as governor of Alaska.</p> <p>The findings were delivered by an investigator appointed last July by a Republican-controlled committee of the Alaskan state legislature. He began his inquiries shortly before Palin was picked as McCain's running mate, and his conclusions appear certain to lead to questions over McCain's judgment and to allegations that she would be unsuited for national office.</p> <p>Stephen Branchflower, a former prosecutor, found Palin had breached the Alaska Executive Branch Ethics Act, which states that \"each public officer holds office as a public trust and any effort to benefit a personal or financial interest through official action is a violation of that trust\".</p> <p>Branchflower concluded that Palin's feud with her former brother-in-law, Mike Wooten, an officer of the Alaskan state police, was \"likely a contributory factor\" in her decision to dismiss the head of that force, Walt Monegan. However, he also concluded that this dismissal had been carried out in a \"proper and lawful\" fashion.</p> <p>The committee voted to disclose much of Branchflower's report public early this morning after deliberating in secret for more than six hours. </p> <p>Although eight of the 12 members of the committee are Republicans, they voted unanimously for its publication. Palin has made a number of enemies among her fellow Republicans in Alaska after she picked fights with the party's local leadership en route to election as governor, and then formed alliances with Democrats in a bid to force through her legislative programme.</p> <p>Palin will probably not face impeachment proceedings, with local Democrats and Republicans saying they have little appetite for such a move. The committee's chairman, Kim Elton, a Democrat, said he agreed with Branchflower's findings but added: \"We don't charge people, we don't try people as legislators.\"</p> <p>With McCain struggling to overtake Barack Obama in the polls less than four weeks before the election, the report's findings could barely have been worse for the Republicans.</p> <p>Palin had denied all wrongdoing, and shortly before the report was published her husband, Todd, sought to shoulder some of the blame by admitting he had he repeatedly complained about Wooten, believing him to be a danger to the public.<br> Wooten had been through an acrimonious divorce and custody battle with Mrs Palin's younger sister, Molly McCann, in 2005. A number of complaints that the Palin family made about him at that time were upheld, and in March 2006 he was disciplined but allowed to keep his job.</p> <p>Palin came into office as governor of Alaska nine months later, and Monegan came under pressure to fire Wooten immediately after she appointed him the state public safety commissioner.</p> <p>Monegan told Branchflower he had been summoned to see Todd Palin, who complained that Wooten's punishment had been merely a \"slap on the wrist.\" Monegan said he understood the Palins wanted Wooten fired. \"I had this kind of ominous feeling that I may not be long for this job if I didn't somehow respond accordingly,\" Monegan told the investigator.</p> <p>Branchflower found that Todd Palin enjoyed extraordinary access to the governor's office and her closest advisers, despite being unelected and having no salaried state post. He used that access to try to get Wooten fired, the report found.</p> <p>Branchflower criticised Palin for taking no action to rein in her husband, and said there was some evidence that she participated in the effort. \"Such impermissible and repeated contacts create conflicts of interests for subordinate employees who must choose to either please a superior or run the risk of facing that superior's displeasure and the possible consequences of that displeasure,\" the report states. </p> <p>A further finding of Branchflower's 263-page report was that the office of the Alaska state attorney general, Talis Colberg, failed to comply with his request to release information about the case held in various e-mails.</p> <p>A number of Alaskan republicans attempted to halt publication of the report with a series of court case, but the state's supreme court dismissed their final bid on Thursday, paving the way for its publication.</p> <p>Monegan said: I feel vindicated. It sounds like they've validated my belief and opinions. And that tells me I'm not totally out in left field.\"</p> <p>McCain's campaign team insisted the Alaskan committee had \"overreached\" itself. It issued a statement saying: \"Today's report shows that the governor acted within her proper and lawful authority in the reassignment of Walt Monegan. The report also illustrates what we've known all along: this was a partisan led inquiry run by Obama supporters and the Palins were completely justified in their concern regarding Trooper Wooten given his violent and rogue behaviour.\"</p> <p>The Alaskan state senator Gary Stevens, a Republican, objected to the report while agreeing that its contents should be made public. \"I would encourage people to be very cautious, to look at this with a jaundiced eye,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>No wonder the City and the banking fraternity are purring over the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/08/marketturmoil.creditcrunch\">Darling financial package</a>. It must be the biggest bail-out without strings in modern history. But it is going to skin the taxpayer for a decade or more and stymie expenditure to counter the recession on anything like the scale required.</p> <p>Where else would <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/08/creditcrunch.banking1\">\u00a3400-500bn</a> of public money be ploughed in to unfreeze a set of paralysed institutions without the government taking any controlling interest? Even the \u00a350bn recapitalisation is in the form of preference shares which involve no voting rights. A sum equal to about a third of Britain's entire GDP has been poured into the banking sector unconditionally. Incentives have been given to the banks to participate, but with no enforceability to secure needed outcomes. It shows the government is still far too much in hock to the financial sector, even though they are the miscreants who have brought the country to this impasse.</p> <p>Again, in any other area of public life would vast sums of public assistance be shelled out to salvage failing organisations while retaining the bosses who brought about the catastrophe in the first place? Even private US banks booted out their chief executives when their share prices nosedived as a result of gross mismanagement, notably packing their asset base with toxic derivatives. </p> <p>Here, however, the perpetrators like the RBS boss, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/2008/oct/08/royalbankofscotlandgroup.banking\">Fred Goodwin</a>, sail on with impunity, seemingly accountable to no one and now \u2013 adding insult to injury \u2013 eligible for huge dollops of public largesse while retaining their position. The great weakness of the Brown-Darling package is that the sinners go unpunished while the toxic loans they engineered are written off by taxpayers' money.</p> <p>But the really big concern about the Darling plan is that servicing and paying off \u00a3500bn borrowings will pre-empt the public accounts for years if not decades to come and will massively inhibit the handling of the real threat that faces us \u2013 a global depression. That can only be countered by much deeper cuts in interest rates than the 0.5% so <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/08/interestrates.interestrates\">exaggeratedly welcomed</a> earlier this week, plus a massive public works programme (notably 100,000 social houses built per year, not the 2,500 the government has in mind) and big tax cuts for average and low-paid families. What we absolutely should not get, but probably will, is the opposite \u2013 painful public expenditure cuts made inevitable, we shall be told, by the \u00a3500bn overhang.</p> <p>So how should such a real economy stabilisation package be funded? As Gordon Brown has rightly said, exceptional times call for exceptional measures. The scale of tax evasion by the big corporations and the super-rich, now reliably estimated to rob the Treasury of \u00a375-150bn a year, should be tackled with wartime rigour.</p> <p>The tax havens hiding billions offshore should be opened up by law and the vast wealth illegally accumulated there over decades should be repatriated to replenish Treasury coffers. And in an unprecedented crisis like this, a significant tax surcharge needs to be levied on the broadest shoulders \u2013 the hedge funds and private equity operators, the higher rate taxpayers (particularly the 1% richest) and the biggest businesses. It will hurt, but not doing so will hurt much more.</p>",
  "<p>Strange times bring strange bedfellows. On the same day that Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling were putting the finishing touches to their <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/08/marketturmoil.creditcrunch\">plan</a> to bail out the banks with up to \u00a3500bn of public money, the international labour movement marked the first ever <a href=\"http://www.wddw.org/-English-\">world day for decent work</a>.</p> <p>Events in more than 100 countries across five continents made it a genuinely global occasion, yet fears of imminent recession and accompanying job losses put any celebrations on ice. Instead the day was spent in sober reflection on the role decent work has to play in rebalancing the global economy and addressing the root causes of the crisis now threatening to spread across the world.</p> <p>For with the ink barely dry on the government's immediate rescue plans, attention is already turning to the <a href=\"http://www.lloydslist.com/ll/news/viewArticle.htm?articleId=1218105165015&amp;src=rss\">underlying economic problems</a> that have allowed the current financial crisis to develop. Even now, the recognition is growing that fundamental changes are needed to the global economic system far beyond the reach of recapitalisation packages or injections of liquidity, however large.</p> <p>Increasingly, too, there is an understanding that rebalancing the relationship between capital and labour will be a central element in any long-term solution. Put simply, decent work forms an essential part of the macroeconomic restructuring needed to address the roots of the current malaise.</p> <p>The basic <a href=\"http://www.ilo.org/global/About_the_ILO/Mainpillars/WhatisDecentWork/index.htm\">definition</a> of decent work is productive employment for women and men in conditions of freedom, equity, security and human dignity. The moral case for such rights has been clear ever since Engels wrote his classic <a href=\"http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/condition-working-class/\">account</a> of the working class in England in 1844, and there is still much to do today to ensure that all workers in Britain enjoy decent pay and working conditions. While the minimum wage <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/mar/05/houseofcommons.economy\">posted</a> its latest rise this month, to \u00a35.73 an hour, many employers still break the law by not paying it. Women migrant workers are those most at <a href=\"http://www.tuc.org.uk/newsroom/tuc-15182-f0.cfm\">risk</a>.</p> <p>Yet many of the worst sweatshops relocated long ago to the low-cost labour markets of the developing world. The media has been filled with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/jul/16/supermarkets.retail2\">stories</a> of workers producing goods for the British high street in abominable conditions in countries such as Bangladesh, China and India.</p> <p>Consumers have expressed outrage at news of women being forced to work around the clock for a few pence an hour under the threat of constant abuse and humiliation. As long as there are no legal requirements that companies must guarantee all workers decent conditions and a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/12/highstreetretailers.retail\">living wage</a>, such scandals will continue.</p> <p>The UN has also stressed the importance of decent work for poverty reduction. Achieving full employment and decent work for all has been <a href=\"http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/poverty.shtml\">enshrined</a> in the millennium development goals adopted by world leaders at the start of the century.</p> <p>UN agencies <a href=\"http://www.oit.org/public/english/region/asro/bangkok/public/releases/yr2007/pr07_04.htm\">confirm</a> that productive employment is the link that can translate economic growth into long-term development, enabling people to work their way out of poverty rather than just deeper into debt. Without decent work opportunities for the many, growth simply concentrates the benefits of economic development in the hands of an elite few.</p> <p>Yet decent work is no longer just a moral imperative. The financial crisis has underlined the systemic dangers to the wider economy of ignoring workers' rights. For while the crisis may have manifested itself in the <a href=\"http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/investing-and-markets/article.html?in_article_id=452145&amp;in_page_id=3\">convulsions</a> of the financial markets, its roots are to be found in the imbalance which has been allowed to grow between corporate power on the one hand and a disempowered labour movement on the other. \"Light touch\" globalisation has brought multinational corporations vast new freedoms as the regulations governing their operations are dismantled in country after country. By contrast, workers have found their rights, wages and working conditions increasingly undermined.</p> <p>As a result of this imbalance, multinational companies have amassed huge profits in the globalised economy, notably through relocating to or sourcing from labour markets such as China where pay and conditions are kept low. Working people have been largely <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/28/business/28wages.html\">excluded</a> from the feast, as shown by the decline in the share of national income enjoyed by wages and salaries over the past three decades. The UK and US credit bubbles were inflated to record levels in order to make up for this shortfall in working people's pay packets, and it is the bursting of those bubbles that echoes all around us today.</p> <p>By the same token, decent remuneration of workers is now necessary both to avoid driving us deeper into recession and to restore a broader macroeconomic balance. Darling's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/09/tradeunions.policy\">suggestion</a> just last month that public-sector wages must be kept low to stave off the threat of inflation now sounds as if it came from another world.</p> <p>This rebalancing of relations between capital and labour is especially important now that recession is looming, not least because it is working people who will again be hit hardest by the economic downturn. As demand weakens and businesses find credit harder to come by, the pressure on jobs will build.</p> <p>The first signs of this are already appearing in Britain, where official figures show the largest <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/17/unemploymentdata.recession\">rise</a> in unemployment in 16 years. The UK jobless total is forecast to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/14/economics.redundancy\">pass</a> the 2 million mark in the coming months for the first time in over a decade.</p> <p>In many of the world's poorest countries the impact will be even worse, and it will again be women workers who are most affected by the downturn. When the economies of south-east Asia collapsed under the financial crisis of 1997, the <a href=\"http://www.unescap.org/unis/press/f_01_98.htm\">feminisation of employment</a> which had been heralded as one of the achievements of the Asian economic miracle turned into a feminisation of unemployment almost overnight. Thousands of Thai and Indonesian women were forced into <a href=\"http://www.twnside.org.sg/title/last-cn.htm\">prostitution</a> as a result of losing their jobs.</p> <p>Today's financial crisis opens up the debate over what sort of economic system we wish to create for the future. Now that the merits of free-market capitalism have been exposed as a dangerous mirage, the world has the opportunity to develop a fairer system of international economic governance and to redistribute the spoils of globalisation.</p> <p>Preserving the current model, with all its failings and injustices, will simply perpetuate the imbalances which have led to today's crisis. A global economy based on decent work and a living wage for all women and men offers a real chance for a new beginning.</p>",
  "<p>John McCain's election campaign last night suffered the body blow which Republicans had been bracing themselves for when his vice-presidential candidate, Sarah Palin, was found to have abused her powers in pursuit of a personal feud with her former brother-in-law.</p> <p>At the end of the 10-week investigation into the so-called Troopergate affair, Palin was found to have breached the ethics rules which govern her conduct as governor of Alaska. The findings, delivered by an investigator who had been hired by the Alaskan state legislature before she was picked as McCain's running mate, are certain to lead to questions over his judgment, and to queries and challenges as to her suitability for national office.</p> <p>Stephen Branchflower, a former prosecutor, found that Palin had breached the Alaska executive branch ethics act, which states that \"each public officer holds office as a public trust, and any effort to benefit a personal or financial interest through official action is a violation of that trust\".</p> <p>Branchflower also concluded that Palin's feud with her former brother-in-law, an officer of the Alaskan state police, was \"likely a contributory factor\" in her decision to dismiss the head of that force, Walt Monegan. However, he did also conclude that the action had been carried out in a \"proper and lawful\" fashion.</p> <p>A committee of the Alaskan state legislature voted to make much of Branchflower's report public after a closed discussion of more than six hours which ended early this morning. The committee, eight Republicans and four Democrats, did not endorse the report, but voted unanimously to release it.</p> <p>Palin will probably not face impeachment proceedings, with both local Democrats and Repubicans saying they have little appetite for such a move. </p> <p>With McCain struggling to overtake Barack Obama in the polls, however, and less than four weeks before the election, the report's findings could barely have been worse for the Republicans. </p> <p>Palin had denied all wrong-doing; her husband, Todd, sought to shoulder some of the blame by admitting that he had he repeatedly complained about the trooper, Mike Wooten, believing him to be a danger to the public. Wooten had been through an acrimonious divorce and custody battle with the governor's younger sister. A number of complaints that the Palin family made about him at that time were upheld, and in March 2006 he was disciplined but allowed to keep his job. </p> <p>Palin came into office as governor of Alaska nine months later, and then put Monegan immediately under pressure to fire Wooten. </p> <p>A further finding of Branchflower's 263-page report was that the Alaska state attorney general failed to comply with his request to release information about the case held in various emails.</p> <p>A number of Alaskan Republicans attempted to halt publication of the report with a series of court cases, but the state's supreme court dismissed their final bid on Thursday, paving the way for its publication.</p> <p>Alaskan state senator Gary Stevens, a Republican, objected to the report while agreeing that its contents should be made public. \"I would encourage people to be very cautious, to look at this with a jaundiced eye,\" he said.</p> <p>With Barack Obama building up significant poll leads all week as a result of the public anxiety over the economic crisis, McCain could have done with a weekend free to concentrate on attacking his rival rather than having to deal with Troopergate.</p> <p>If the election were to be held today, polls suggest Obama would win by a landslide, but the gap could still narrow. A poll published yesterday gave Obama an 8% lead over McCain in Florida, which was pivotal for the Republicans in 2000 and held by them again in 2004. </p> <p>McCain is resting much of his election hopes on taking Pennsylvania from the Democrats, but polls over the last few days give Obama double-digit leads, including one of 13%. The third of the big three swing states, Ohio, is tighter but Obama has leads of between 4-6% in four polls and McCain is ahead by 1% in another.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p>It's the first live show! Don't tell me you're not excited. I'll be here from about 7pm to blog the build-up and the performances of all 12 X-Factor finalists.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p>If you need diversion in the meantime, you can <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/poll/2008/oct/09/thexfactor.realitytv\">vote </a>on which judge you think will emerge victorious, look at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/gallery/2008/oct/09/thexfactor.realitytv?picture=338430502\">photos</a> of the people who'll be entertaining us for the next two and a bit months, or if you need a recap, you can head <a href=\"http://thebitchfactor.blogspot.com\">over here</a> for all kinds of scathing analysis.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>7pm:</strong> So tonight we're leaving behind Bruce's puns and Austin's guns in favour of a world of key changes, literal choreography, sob stories and bickering. It's the marathon first live show of The X-Factor, and it's the first time we'll actually get to hear any of these performers sing a whole song. Whether that's a good or a bad thing remains to be seen. Ashley Cole has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/oct/11/england-kazakhstan-minute-by-minute\">not had a good day</a>; let us see whether his beautiful wife does any better.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>7.20pm: </strong>Starting later than scheduled because of the football, here we go! Our final 12 are going to sing live for our votes - Simon's boys, Dannii's grown-ups, Louis's groups, and Cheryl's girls. All the judges think they are going to win. Simon says the battle is going to start RIGHT NOW. Titles!</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>7.22pm: </strong>Dermot emerges, and introduces the judges. Simon looks unimpressed; Louis looks bemused; Dannii is wearing a pair of blue curtains, whereas Cheryl is wearing a dead animal and shiny trousers.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>7.24pm: </strong>Dermot mocks Louis by saying, \"It's a long, long, <em>long </em>time since you won.\" Louis makes inept attempts to regain face, and then introduces his first act, Girl Band. We have a VT of creative director Brian Friedman talking about the elaborate routine he's created for them, which should be a real treat. The girls have been arguing in rehearsals, and Louis states the obvious by saying that they can't do that on stage. They're singing Venus, and the vocals sound weirdly echoey and thin, but I'm not sure if that's a sound problem or their actual voices. Louis is singing along, which is all they need.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>7.27pm:</strong> Dannii says, \"This is the campest opening we've had to this show - I'm not sure if it was Brian or if it was Louis.\" Ha! She and Cheryl agree that it was a good start; Simon thought it was OK, and is booed. \"Predictable song, predictable styling...it was like a Girls Aloud bunch of rejects,\" he says. Cheryl looks glacial. The girls try to fight back and make themselves look a bit daft. Louis says he's proud of them.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>7.30pm: </strong>Simon says, \"Now we're going to have a singer.\" Ouch. It's fame-hungry Austin, who has had some kind of Goth/emo makeover. Simon and Cheryl both note his utter desperation. He's singing Every Breath You Take amidst a stageful of dry ice. His high notes are a bit wobbly from time to time, but it's pretty good. I find him singularly uncharismatic but I know lots of people like him. My sister, for one.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>7.34pm:</strong> Dannii and Cheryl agree it was the perfect song. Cheryl and Louis agree that he looks like a pop star. Simon says it was 60 per cent of his potential ability and he basically needs to pull his finger out. Dermot does a spot of male bonding with Austin, with all kind of manly hugging and complicated handshakes, and we get the first mention of the word \"journey\" this evening, which I believe merits a shot of the spirit of your choice in any X-Factor drinking game worthy of the name.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>7.40pm:</strong> Back after the first of many, many breaks, and next to sing a \"UK or US number one hit\" is Daniel Evans, who looks like Ricky Gervais. He is worried about forgetting his lyrics, and Brian Friedman is worried about the entire performance. \"The direction of my life depends on THIS SONG,\" declares Daniel, rather melodramatically. He's singing I Want To Know What Love Is. Simon looks appalled. And quite rightly so. Daniel doesn't have a bad voice at all, but this is a very polished cabaret-style performance and I suspect that's what Cowell is going to say. Oh my goodness, there's a random key change shoved in for absolutely no reason and with no warning. Dear me.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>7.46pm: </strong>Cheryl scrabbles around for nice things to say, and settles on, \"If this were Great Guy Factor, you'd go through.\" Louis likes his new teeth and earring but thinks he looks like Ricky Gervais, which he does. Simon thinks it was like somebody singing in a pub. \"You're always going to get a round of applause, but you cannot win a show like this,\" he concludes. Dannii wibbles on about his bravery and thanks him for sharing his story with the world. Daniel is all earnest and says that he hopes he can get better.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>7.48pm:</strong> \"Queen of Tyneside\" Cheryl introduces Alexandra, and says that her protegee's performance will prove that Louis lost his mind when he didn't put her through in the previous series. She begins by standing on a red box and singing a slowed-down ballady version of I Wanna Dance With Somebody, shoving in melisma whenever possible and waving her arms in a manner befitting a diva. Then a hi-NRG backing track kicks in, as do some strange flames and two accompanying girl dancers. Key change! Stamping across the stage! Abrupt end to the track! Well, it's my favourite performance so far.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>7.52pm:</strong> I am so worried that I am so inured to this show that I know what everyone's going to say all the time. Louis talks about divas, Dannii says when Whitney sings it she just stands there, and Simon asks Louis to apologise to Alexandra. He won't, because he thinks he did the right thing. \"I'm a better person now,\" she says, and the panel bar Louis chorus, \"And you've got a better mentor!\"</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>8pm:</strong> We've had our second break, and Dermot is in the audience talking to the insanely blinkered friends and families of JLS, who are our next act. They VT about this being their dream and not wanting to go back to their normal lives. Vocal coach Yvie tells them to get the notes right, which is obviously very helpful advice. Simon says it is the hardest song in the world to sing. And that song is I'll Make Love To You. I haven't learnt any of the individuals' names in any of the groups yet, but the boy who sings first has some dubious breathing. Apart from that, I do like their close harmony, though I'd suggest some intensive coaching on how to command a stage, rather than bobbing up and down. Ooh, key change!</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>8.04pm:</strong> Dannii mocks Louis's excitement, and then mocks the boys for having lots of clothes at the X-Factor house. Cheryl says they are professional and consistent. Simon says it didn't start very well, and it was a crazy song choice, but the boys look and behave like a group, with fantastic chemistry. He says they are potentially the best group they've ever had on the show, but seeing as the only other good group they've had is Same Difference, it's not really that much of a compliment. We learn that JLS stands for \"Jack the Lad Swing\", which doesn't even make sense.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>8.07pm:</strong> Scott talks about his journey and quitting his job at Pontins for The X-Factor. He has struggled with Brian Friedman's choreography, as everyone seems to do. He is singing Yeah Yeah, is dressed as a Rat Pack singer, and his diction is appalling. I am getting dreadful Leon flashbacks from last year, and Ray flashbacks from the year before that.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>8.11pm:</strong> Louis gets his own back on Simon by ripping Scott to shreds and saying it is the worst song choice ever. Dannii concurs. Scott looks like he is about to burst into tears, and confesses that he didn't initially want to sing it, but he trusts Simon 110 per cent. Cheryl tells him he is a nice guy, and she sees where Simon was going with the song choice, but it was still rubbish. Simon admits that he got it wrong, and is greeted by a mixture of boos and applause. He hopes that \"the North of England, where you're from, will give you another chance\" and guarantees he will get a better song next week. Scott finally bursts into tears.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>8.19pm: </strong>Dermot welcomes us back, and judges' assistants Emma Bunton and Kimberley Walsh are in the audience. Dannii introduces Rachel, who used to be in prison and used to take drugs, and has five children, the oldest of whom she had aged 13. It's one of the strongest back stories The X-Factor has had in years, and it was clear from the start that she'd be through to the finals. Anyway, she's had her hair chopped, and seems to be annoyed with her diagonal fringe. She's wearing a very smart suit, and she's singing With Every Heartbeat, and Simon and Louis look utterly gobsmacked. I'm quite enjoying it until she tries to get some audience participation going, and then I'm mortified on her behalf.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>8.24pm:</strong> Louis thought it was the wrong song. Rachel evidently agrees. Cheryl and Simon say similar things, and Rachel has clearly had a crash-course on how to take criticism with humility, as she keeps repeating, \"Thank you very much. I appreciate that. It's taken on board.\" Dannii says that she chose the song because she knew she'd be able to get the audience going, and thanks Rachel for giving it her best shot.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>8.27pm: </strong>Cheryl introduces \"my Diana Vickers\". Aw. Diana VTs about being from Blackburn and not paying attention in school; Cheryl says she is captivating; Brian Friedman is worried about her too. Seriously, Brian, if you're that worried about every single contestant not being able to understand or learn your staging, maybe you ought to rethink a) your routines and b) your teaching techniques. Diana is wearing a bath towel, it seems, and she's singing a string-laden version of With or Without You, which is a little too low for her at the start. But Cheryl is certainly right about her being like a little doll and having a quality that makes her mesmerising.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>8.31pm: </strong>Louis jabbers on about being cool and contemporary; Dannii admires the quirkiness but thinks there might be \"too much hands\" going on; Simon says she's the singing version of Marmite and doesn't want her to become a karaoke singer, but he thought it was fantastic. Cheryl says that she nailed it and she's very proud of her. That's two drinks right there! Dermot does adorable giggling and squealing with Diana, and she confesses that she is barefoot because she was worried she'd fall over in her shoes. Aww!</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>8.38pm:</strong> Louis introduces Bad Lashes, who do not want to go back to their day jobs. Simon says he has never heard this group sing in tune. Ow. They are singing It Must Have Been Love, and my major problem with this is that they, or whoever has done the arrangement, have mistaken two people singing a major third above the tune as a harmony. It is not. It is lazy and thoughtless arranging.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>8.41pm:</strong> Dannii and Cheryl admire their makeover; Simon basically calls them tedious and irrelevant and advises them to tell Louis what they should be doing because he is \"almost 70\". Louis's comeback? \"You're going to be 50 next year!\" Ah, Louis, your quick wit hasn't dulled, has it?</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>8.44pm:</strong> Simon introduces the youngest contestant in this year's show, 16-year-old Eoghan. He cannot believe that he's made it this far, and doesn't want a career, he just wants to sing. This week, he'll be singing one of the most recognisable songs in the whole world, and it's a massive risk. That song is Imagine. Eoghan's doe eyes peering down the camera at me combined with his teenage smirk and affected hand motions make me want to throw things at the television.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>8.48pm: </strong>Louis likes Eoghan because he is from Ireland. Dannii asks Eoghan if he has a girlfriend, which is a bit weird. Cheryl thinks he's adorable. Simon says that what he did tonight worked, he got it right, and he is very proud of him.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>8.54pm:</strong> The end is almost in sight - two more acts to go. Simon says that he trusts the British public to make the right decision. That's more than I do, Cowell. Dannii introduces Ruth, who says that this competition is the most important thing she has ever done in her life. She thinks her job is all right, but she wants to sing, though she's worried she'll get overwhelmed with emotion yet again. But it's OK, because she's got her gimmick - singing in Spanish! This time it's Take My Breath Away getting the special Ruth interpretation. She looks beautiful, all flowing hair and white dress, with an impressive display of bosom, and a wind machine following her round the stage, but if the bilingualness is all she's got, that's going to wear thin very quickly.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>9pm: </strong>Louis thinks people in Benidorm would like her. Simon says that Louis doesn't understand her because she is a REAL WOMAN, and he doesn't get that. Louis gets all jumpy and says, \"I get it! You fancy her!\" Simon's like, duh, yeah. Oh, Louis, when will you realise that calling Simon a virile heterosexual on live television doesn't constitute an insult? Ruth claims her allotted kisses from Dermot, and wanders off.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>9.03pm: </strong>Laura's the last to sing. She reckons she struggles with confidence, though I can't say I noticed that in the early rounds. She's singing Alicia Keys's Falling in a really bizarrely affected way, and she's getting so caught up in the music she's almost Falling out of her dress. Ha. And then there's a key change for no reason, and she starts shouting, and Cheryl gets really excited, and I just DO NOT UNDERSTAND.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>9.06pm:</strong> Dannii tells her she's \"the bomb\"; Simon thinks it was outstanding; Cheryl cannot believe that someone with as much talent as her has so many insecurities. Dermot strides on and kisses Laura, and then Laura thanks her daddy for believing in her. She says she's worked really hard and wants people to keep voting for her, even though the voting hasn't actually started yet.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>9.10pm:</strong> Dermot gives us the phone numbers and then we're reminded of the performances - Girl Band had horrible dresses and were drowned out by off-stage singers; Austin was desperate; Daniel was a cruise-ship Ricky Gervais; Alexandra stood on a box; JLS bobbed up and down; Scott was utterly sandbagged by his song and cried; Rachel wore a suit and performed like she was on the Radio One Roadshow; Diana didn't wear shoes; Bad Lashes had bad harmonies; Eoghan stared us into submission; Ruth sang in Spanish and exercised womanly allure; Laura has an incredible range but no feeling.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p>Well, I'm supposed to be back at 10pm to give you the results, but as Leon Jackson is going to be the \"special guest star\", I'm not sure I can bring myself to sit through it. Maybe I can switch over when he's on? We'll sort something out. Join me in 45 minutes to see who's out - and in the meantime, keep commenting with your predictions!</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>9.40pm: </strong>Hold the phone. I didn't know this, but there's a <a href=\"http://xfactor.itv.com/stories/story-detail/item_100241.htm\">format change</a> this year. The bottom two will sing off but they'll be performing a song they've chosen themselves, thus absolving their mentors from all responsibility.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>10pm: </strong>Earlier tonight, we heard the final 12 sing live for our votes. You know what happened, and if you don't, you've got time to catch up by reading the rest of the blog. Dermot attempts to inject some drama, and says there's going to be a HUGE TWIST later on, which I presume is the format change for the sing-off.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>10.05pm: </strong>Dermot is introducing Leon Jackson in the most disgustingly disingenous way and I want to vomit. My television picture flickers and for a moment I think that I will be spared the horror. Tragically, no. But to give him his due, though he still can't sustain a note or enunciate, his new haircut is quite good. WHY IS IT NOT OVER YET?</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>10.12pm:</strong> The phone lines are closed! Of course, we can't move on to the actual results yet. We need to milk the advertising revenue a bit more first.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>10.16pm:</strong> Dermot welcomes us back to the moment of truth, and the judges and contestants are ushered onto the stage. Simon looks very stern; the ladies are beaming; Louis looks as smug as ever.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>10.18pm:</strong> In no particular order, the acts performing next week - JLS; Diana; Rachel (who does some strange celebratory dance); Austin; Ruth; Laura; Daniel (FOR REAL?); Eoghan; Alexandra (who sobs - and that means all of Dannii's and all of Cheryl's acts are through now); and Scott (SERIOUSLY?). The sing-off is between Bad Lashes and Girl Band, and though I feel a bit sorry for the girls, it is quite amusing that they are two of Louis's acts. Girl Band are going to sing That's What Friends Are For, because they are friends and they mean what they're going to sing; Bad Lashes are going to sing Wonderwall, because that's the song that got them where they are today. The inanity is making me laugh.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>10.28pm: </strong>The girls are all waiting backstage, and Louis's useful advice to them is to come on to the stage and sing their hearts out. Simon suggests the girls should sack Louis; Louis says Simon picked the worst song this week; Simon says none of his acts are in the bottom two, and it's all a bit pathetic.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>10.30pm:</strong> Girl Band go first, and I much prefer this to the mess that was Venus. Louis is nodding his head like Churchill the dog. Key change! I am sure most of the harmonies are being sung off-stage by proper people, as happened with Hope last year. When Dermot asks what Bad Lashes should do, Louis says, \"I don't know what to say.\" That's why he gets paid the big bucks, gang - right there! The blonde girl with the big fringe pronounces her vowel sounds very oddly. I think I preferred Girl Band, but I didn't really like that version of Wonderwall. The drama! The tension!</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>10.35pm:</strong> Simon thinks both groups were shocking, he bitches a bit with Louis before Dermot tells them off, and chooses to send home Bad Lashes. Cheryl is crying already, and chooses to send home Girl Band. Dannii doesn't want to have to make a decision, despite that being her job, but eventually opts to send home Girl Band. Louis says he doesn't want to send home either, so he says Bad Lashes, which means that we're in DEADLOCK and going down to the public vote. The DEADLOCK music and graphics kick in, and the audience laugh - presumably not the desired effect. Dermot gets the envelope of doom, and the act with the lowest number of votes who are going home tonight are <strong>Bad Lashes</strong>.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>10.38pm: </strong>There is horrendous wailing and keening, and as Dermot attempts to keep some semblance of control over the show, there's a montage of Bad Lashes' best moments through the audition process, monumentally slowed down, obviously, in order to stretch out very little footage.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p>So next week, the remaining 11 will be singing Michael Jackson songs. If Eoghan sings Ben, I shall do something drastic. Thanks for your company tonight - enjoy the rest of your weekend x</p>",
