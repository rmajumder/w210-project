I know this is a radical thing to say, but I'm going to say it anyway: John McCain needs a \"game-changer\" if he's going to win tonight's final debate and, just conceivably, the election. (And whether he wins or loses, the pundits really need to stop using the word \"game-changer\" as soon as possible, because it's starting to get seriously annoying.) The question that's been making headlines, of course, is how McCain will attack Barack Obama over Bill Ayers -- he has signalled that he will, and reacted with visible irritation when Obama expressed surprise that he hadn't said it \"to my face\" the last time around. (Sarah Palin <a href=\"http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalradar/2008/10/palin-prods-mcc.html\">certainly wants him to be aggressive</a>.) And he's said he'll <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20081012/ap_on_el_pr/mccain_economy\">\"whip [Obama's] 'you-know-what'\"</a>. But McCain's dilemma is that Obama's ever-widening poll lead seems to be based partly on voters responding badly to McCain's. Obama's dilemma -- which could create a crucial moment in a performance we can otherwise exepct to be cool and controlled as per usual -- is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2008/oct/15/barackobama-johnmccain-debate\">how he responds</a> so as to dismiss the matter without looking evasive or untruthful. </p> <p>The official topic of tonight's 90-minute debate at Hofstra University in Hempstead, on Long Island in New York state -- <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Hofstra_University_alumni\">Christopher Walken's alma mater</a>, by the way -- is domestic affairs. McCain needs to <a href=\"http://us.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/10/15/presidential.debate/index.html\">use it to differentiate his new economic plan from Obama's</a>, but that won't be enough to beat the odds now: they're completely <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/oct/15/uselections2008-barackobama2\">stacked against him</a>. Could he concoct some big surprise tonight that <em>doesn't</em> rely on attacking Obama's character -- for example by challenging his rival to more debates, pledging to serve only one term, or promising a bipartisan cabinet, as George Stephanpolous <a href=\"http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalradar/2008/10/stephanopoul-10.html\">speculates</a>? (A big gesture that doesn't involve pure negativity might appeal, especially if McCain is giving any thought to how to go out a dignified loser, if losing's his fate.) All these questions and more will be answered, or at least pondered in the company of beer and potato chips and salsa, during the course of an all-action liveblog, here from approximately <strong>8.50pm eastern time, 1.50am UK time</strong>; the debate begins at 9pm/2am. (You can watch the debate live in the UK on BBC News Channel, Freeview 080). Join me! It'll probably be fun, in a way.</p> <p>The main difference in tonight's <strong>format</strong> is that the candidates will be seated at a semicircular desk with the <strong>moderator</strong>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Schieffer\">Bob Schieffer of CBS News</a>. That might seem to favour McCain, who looked restless last time, occasionally wandering around the stage -- but it could also make any contemptuous body language towards Obama, such as not looking him in the eye, seem much worse. (And on MSNBC, Keith Olbermann is speculating even now that the arrangement might force camera angles showing the <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/s/mcb_election2008/20080926/wl_mcb_election2008/liberaladshowsmccainscarsquestionshealth\">scarred side</a> of McCain's face.) Continuing our tour of great American beers, tonight's <em>beer</em> is Snake Dog India Pale Ale, from Colorado's <a href=\"http://www.flyingdogales.com/beer-snake-dog.asp\">Flying Dog Brewery</a>; the drinking game will be improvised as we go along, for maximum alcohol consumption. The presence of an elitist London news editor here at Guardian Election Central tonight means there's also a drink called \"wine\", though as a regular Joe Sixpack I've no idea what that is.</p> <p><strong>8.25pm</strong> (all times eastern): Comments enabled now. Sorry about that.</p> <p><strong>8.55pm</strong>: The hall is full, and hushed, as we wait to discover exactly how Bob Schieffer will tell everyone to turn their mobile phones off... Ah, here he is, delivering a few words in memory of Tim Russert. (Did a CNN anchor just say that McCain called Hillary Clinton today for tips on handling this debate, by the way? How... curious.) </p> <p><strong>9pm</strong>: Schieffer lays out the format: nine 10-minute sections, with 2-minute responses, then a discussion, in which he'll encourage talk between the candidates. Obama and McCain enter and shake hands, rather warmly, it seemed to me, and with an exchange of pleasantries, though not quite on the \"can I call you Joe\" level. Schieffer asks them about their rival economic plans, McCain first.</p> <p>McCain begins with his obligatory Reference to Somebody Who is Ill and Needs Our Sympathy, in this case Nancy Reagan. \"America is hurting,\" he says. We need to put a \"floor\" under the decline in the housing market. He's setting out his mortgage buyup plan.</p> <p><strong>9.05pm</strong>: Obama says it's the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, and lays out his four-point plan from earlier this week. He seems to be trying to say \"middle-class\" as frequently as possible. (Will McCain say it once, even, tonight? He didn't do so in either of the previous debates.) McCain: \"I would like to mention that senator Obama was out in Ohio and he had an encounter with a plumber [named Joe]... Joe wanted to buy his business, but he saw you were going to make him pay much higher taxes.\" Straight onto the tax attack, and a strong start for McCain, though he's blinking madly, it has to be said. \"Joe, I want to tell you, I will not stand for a tax increase on small business income... \" Then, directly to Obama: \"What you want to do for Joe the plumber, and millions more like him\" is to prevent him realising the American dream. Obama replies that he'll cut taxes for 95% of Americans, including Joe the Plumber.</p> <p>Ah, I was wondering when McCain would bring up the key phrase from Obama's encounter with Joe the Plumber -- Obama said he believed in \"spread[ing] the wealth around\". It's \"class warfare\", McCain says. </p> <p><strong>9.12pm</strong>: Is Joe the Plumber related to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yCsReOId1k\">Joe Le Taxi</a>?</p> <p><strong>9.15pm</strong>: Schieffer asks a question the candidates have been asked before, and never quite answered: what will you sacrifice from your policy platforms, given the state of the economy? Obama says he'll go through the federal budget \"line by line\", eliminating programs that don't work, which isn't technically an answer. McCain: Energy independence! Oh yeah. \"We have to stop sending $600bn a year to countries that don't like us very much.\" McCain promises to take a hatchet to the federal budget and <em>then</em> a scalpel, which is an interesting approach to surgery. (The male undecided Ohio voters on CNN's running display seem to love this.)</p> <p>...Earmarks, and the Illinois planetarium projector! Time for a drink. I'm growing to love that roguish planetarium projector like an old friend. Obama gives his standard response, which is that earmarks are important (and some of them are \"screwy\") but don't count for much, especially in comparison to the budget deficit of the last eight years.</p> <p>McCain -- a good soundbite: \"Senator Obama, I am not president Bush. If you wanted to run against President Bush, you should have run four years ago.\" He repeats the \"taxes on anyone earning over $42,000\" claim, which Obama rejects by pointing out that even Fox News disputes it. \"And that doesn't happen very often.\"</p> <p><strong>9.22pm</strong>: McCain gets tetchy in response to the suggestion that he votes with his party and with George Bush on pretty much everything. </p> <p><strong>9.25pm</strong>: Both of you pledged to take the high road, Schieffer says, and yet neither of you have done so: he mentions Palin's \"pallin' around with terrorists\" line. \"Are each of you tonight willing to sit at this table and say to each others' face what people in your campaigns have said about each other?\" Schieffer seems actively to be trying to provoke a fight here. McCain says none of this would have happened if Obama had accepted his town-hall invitation, and now acts very hurt and wounded about Congressman John Lewis's remarks earlier this week, in which he linked McCain and Palin to civil-rights-era racism in the South.</p> <p>\"Senator Obama has spent more money on negative ads than any political campaign in history, and I can prove it.\" Tough stuff, though it's always a little strange the way he smiles while he's doing it. Now he accuses Obama of not keeping his word on public finances. \"You didn't tell the American people the truth.\" </p> <p><strong>9.31pm</strong>: Obama himself, in what seems like a defence of Lewis, brings up the shouts of \"terrorist\" and \"kill him\" that have been heard at Palin rallies. \"Read what he said! You gotta read what he said!\" McCain splutters, interrupting. But Obama does call Lewis's comparison with the civil rights era \"inappropriate.\" McCain gets very cross indeed when Obama accuses him of negative campaigning. \"Let me just say categorically, I'm proud of the people who come to our rallies,\" he says, and adds something completely confusing about people wearing hats. \"A lot of things have been said at your rallies that I'm not happy with,\" he tells Obama. It's all about John McCain's wounded feelings tonight, it seems.</p> <p><strong>9.35pm</strong>: via Ezra Klein, it's <a href=\"http://www.joetheplumber.com/\">Joe the Plumber</a>, the friendliest plumber in town! I don't think this is <em>the</em> Joe the Plumber, though.</p> <p><strong>9.36pm</strong>: \"Mr Ayers,\" McCain begins. \"I don't care about a washed-up terrorist, but... we need to know the full extent of that relationship.\" And there's your first reference to Bill Ayers, but McCain doesn't wait, or even press the point much; he moves on to saying that the community organisation ACORN is in the process of perpetrating one of the biggest voter frauds in American history. Which even Joe The Plumber would point out is a ridiculously exaggerated claim that nobody else is making.</p> <p>\"Mr Ayers has become the centrepiece of Senator McCain's campaign,\" Obama says, talking of how he's \"roundly condemned\" Ayers's \"despicable\" acts, and how he served on a school board with Ayers but with various Republicans, too, under the auspices of a close friend of Ronald Reagan's. \"Mr Ayers is not involved in my campaign, he has never been involved in this campaign, and he will not advise me in the White House. So that's Mr Ayers.\" </p> <p>Obama says his only involvement with ACORN was representing them alongside the US Justice Department. \"The allegation that Sen McCain has continually made is that some of my associations are problematic\" and so Obama mentions his other \"associations\" with Warren Buffett, various Republican bigwigs, etcetera. McCain seems frozen and grinning.</p> <p><strong>9.38pm</strong>: McCain says Obama and Ayers sent $230,000 to ACORN, and that Obama launched his political career in Ayers's living room. \"That's not true,\" says Obama. (Maybe it was the kitchen?) \"Facts are facts,\" says McCain, hammering onwards, but CNN's undecided voters aren't interested; the meter is flatlining.</p> <p><strong>9.45pm</strong>: Joe again -- only this time it's Joe Biden, in response to a question inviting the candidates to celebrate the brilliance of their running-mates. McCain ends his Palin pitch with a strange little tribute to Todd 'The Snowmobile' Palin, a smile and a snuffle. Then he starts twitching as Obama speaks; he's a roiling cauldron of emotions tonight, though he's performing much more strongly than last time. CNN's Ohio women, by the way, <em>really really</em> don't like Sarah Palin, but Obama declines an invitation from Schieffer to argue that she's not qualified to govern. That'll be for the voters to decide, he says.</p> <p><strong>9.47pm</strong>: Schieffer wants to ask a question, he says, about \"climate control.\" \"Climate change!\" McCain snaps back, entirely unnecessarily. While Obama answers, McCain wears a fixed smile, which makes him look like the Joker.</p> <p>\"I admire so much Senator Obama's eloquence,\" McCain says. Ouch. \"He said we should 'look at' offshore drilling. 'Look at' -- you get that? We can drill now!\" And what's more, you betcha Joe the Plumber will do the drilling, if you ask him nicely and don't steal all his taxes. Obama says America needs a president who will \"enforce unfair trade agreements\". Did the McCain perma-grin twitch a little at the slip-up? I think it did, I think it did!</p> <p><strong>9.53pm</strong>: John McCain is a very strange chap. I'm sorry, but there it is. </p> <p><strong>9.57pm</strong>: Do you favour controlling health care costs over expanding coverage? Both, says Obama. McCain wants to put health records online (lots of data entry involved, but maybe Joe the Plumber can do that too?) Oh, and he reprises his $5,000 refundable tax credit for everyone, to which Obama soon gives his oft-heard response: the extra income taxation involved in McCain's healthcare plans would eliminate the benefits.</p> <p>McCain directly addresses \"my old buddy Joe the Plumber\". This is getting ridiculous. \"If you're out there my friend, and you've got employees and you've got kids, if you don't get the healthcare plan that Senator Obama mandates, he's going to fine you.\" Obama says Joe the Plumber would pay no fine, because his business is a small business. This debate has now become completely dominated by Joe the Plumber. It's going to be funny tomorrow when Joe the Plumber goes on all the cable networks and reveals that he's a die-hard Ron Paul supporter who thinks money should be abolished.</p> <p><strong>10.06pm</strong>: An abortion question: could either of you ever nominate someone to the Supreme Court who disagrees with you on Roe vs Wade? No litmus test, says McCain. No \"strict litmus test,\" says Obama, but he agrees with Roe vs Wade, and \"what ultimately I believe is that women\" -- in consultation with family and others -- \"are in the best position\" to decide.</p> <p>McCain says that as an Illinois state senator, Obama voted to deny treatment to babies born alive in failed abortions. Obama shakes his head, in a sad, Obama way. Big split between CNN's men and women: the women hate this attack from McCain, but the men love it. \"Let me respond to this,\" Obama says. \"If it sounds incredible that I would vote to withhold lifesaving treatment from an infant, that's because it's not true.\" Obama clarifies his position: he voted against a pro-life bill, but the lifesaving treatment was already legally required. \"Another example of Senator Obama's <em>eloquence</em>,\" McCain snaps back.</p> <p>Look, it's Barack Obama and Joe le Plumber:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-338650278\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/10/16/obamaplumber.jpg\" alt=\"Barack Obama and plumber Joe Wurzelbacher\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><br><strong>10.18pm</strong>: Last question, which seems a little early -- on America's terrible standing in international education league tables. Obama wants investment in early childhood education, and an \"army of new teachers\" with more pay in exchange for higher standards. \"Throwing money at the problem isn't the answer,\" McCain responds.</p> <p>...And <a href=\"http://familysecuritymatters.org/publications/id.1465/pub_detail.asp\">here's an interview</a> with Joe the Plumber, Joe Wurzelbacher, himself:</p> <p>Q: Do you think your question surprised Obama, caught him off guard at all?<br>A: Well that was actually my intent. Most people, you ask them \"do you believe in the American Dream?\" Nine times out of ten they'll sit there and go, \"Yeah, of course!\" That's where he messed up, because as soon as I asked him that, his answer shows that he doesn't believe in the American Dream. You know, like the question you asked before \u2013 he pretty much contradicted himself. \"I don't want to punish you but --\" Well, you're going to anyways.</p> <p><strong>10.25pm</strong>: CNN's Ohio voters like Obama's education plans more than McCain's.</p> <p><strong>10.27pm</strong>: A discussion of vouchers in the Washington DC school system. Obama doesn't support school vouchers because the data doesn't support the notion that they work. McCain grins at the entirely comical notion of \"data\". \"Because there's not enough vouchers, therefore we shouldn't do it, even though it works? I got it,\" says McCain and does one of his terrible Big Mocking Laughs. Nobody else is allowed to laugh even if they wanted to, which makes McCain look awkward.</p> <p><strong>10.28pm</strong>: Closing statements. McCain has a \"long record\" of being \"a careful steward of your tax dollars.\" It's all about \"whether you can trust us or not... that's why I ask you not only to examine my record but my proposals for the future of this country... a long line of McCains have served our country in war and in peace.\" </p> <p><strong>10.29pm</strong>: Obama: \"The biggest risk we could take right now is to adopt the same failed policies and the same failed politics that we've seen over the last eight years and somehow expect a different result.\" What we need is \"a spirit of sacrifice.\" </p> <p>...Schieffer: \"I will leave you tonight with what my mother always said: go vote now, it will leave you big and strong.\" Obama and McCain stand and shake hands. \"Good job, good job!\" McCain tells Obama. And thus ends the forty-ninth debate of the election, if you include the primaries.</p> <p><strong>10.50pm</strong>: CNN's Ohio focus group were entirely unimpressed by all the Joe the Plumber nonsense, and reckon Obama won.</p> <p><strong>10.52pm</strong>: More shortly, when we get the instant polls, etcetera. My take: McCain's strongest performance yet, without a doubt, but that's really not saying very much -- he made Obama's coolness and reserve look a little more like passivity, but on the other hand, he didn't focus his Ayers-related attack at all: he just mentioned Ayers a bit, whereas Obama had a sharp but not-too-short response ready that seemed to draw a line under the matter. Close-ups of McCain's face just don't do him any favours, either; anger, disdain and contempt flicker across his face every few seconds.<br> <strong>10.58pm</strong>: Joe Wurzelbacher is on CBS. He says he's uncommitted, but he strikes me as more likely a McCain voter, and says McCain impressed him the most tonight.</p> <p><strong>11.06pm</strong>: CNN instant poll of uncommitted voters: 58% gave the debate to Obama, 31% to McCain; 70% found Obama the more likeable; 22% McCain. No game-changer tonight, then... CBS has similar results, <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2008/10/15/politics/horserace/entry4525171.shtml\">53% to 22%</a>. That's worse for McCain than both the previous debate snap polls, I think. Even Fox News's focus group, run by Frank Luntz, thinks Obama won.</p> <p>Here's <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/09/18/politics/2008debates/main4457570.shtml\">Joe the Plumber on CBS.</a> And <a href=\"http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2008/10/mcangry.html\">here's</a> some very rapidly produced YouTubery of John \"Angry\" McCain.</p> <p><a href=\"http://marcambinder.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/10/valence_and_visuals.php\">Marc Ambinder:</a> \"Tonight, we saw a McXplosion. Every single attack that Sen. McCain has ever wanted to make, he took the opportunity tonight to make. Around 30 minutes in, McCain seemed to surrender the debate to his frustrations, making it seem as if he just wanted the free television.\"</p> <p>So there you have it. Barack Obama won, John McCain didn't, not least because he simply can't control his annoyance and his contempt for his rival. But the real winner was Joe the Plumber. And also Democracy. Which means that, in a very real sense, it was a victory for America, and for each and every one of us. </p> <p>And so, goodnight: my <a href=\"http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/burkeman\">regular blog</a> will continue through to the election. Of course, I'll be liveblogging election night, and quite possibly various other pre-election events as circumstances warrant. Thanks for reading and commenting...</p>",
  "<p>There was a distinct lack of embarrassment among our politicians, I thought, when a UN body published its report earlier this month criticising the UK's \"general climate of intolerance and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/04/justice.youthjustice\">negative public attitudes towards children</a>\". The Geneva-based Committee on the Rights of the Child was scathing about the way we \"demonise\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/youngpeople\">our young</a> and said that as a matter of urgency we should ban all physical punishment in the family, including smacking. All we got from the children's minister Beverly Hughes however, was a prim comment that she would give the report \"careful consideration\" and she blithely went on to justify a practice that should have been criminalised years ago. </p> <p>\"If we put a ban on smacking into legislation it would mean in practice that a mother who gives her child a mild smack on the hand when they refuse to put back sweets picked up at the supermarket checkout could end up facing criminal charges,\" Hughes said. But that is a spurious argument as far as I am concerned. Presenting a seemingly innocuous scenario with which many people would be familiar and probably deem acceptable is a classic strategy of political rhetoric when a government is too weak to be effectively decisive in any particularly sensitive issue. Hughes deftly avoided any attempt to define what precisely constituted a \"mild smack\", for example. She then refuted any notion that it is an act of violence. Perhaps, as many supporters of this type of \"chastisement\" would claim, she regards it as an act of love? Tough love perhaps? A perverse spin on aggressive behaviour if ever I heard one. </p> <p>It was ironic, however, that in the government's defence she should have quoted critics who argue <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/children\">children</a> \"enjoy less protection than prisoners\". Ironic, because currently we have almost 3,000 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/youthjustice\">children in prison</a> in the UK, more than any other western European country. And what of those children? Is it acceptable to subject them to \"mild smacking\"? Well we already know the answer to that. </p> <p>Let us never forget what happened to 14-year-old <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/30/children.youthjustice\">Adam Rickwood</a> when he refused to go to his room in Hassockfield secure centre one night in August four years ago. Subjected to \"restraint\" which included the notorious \"nose distraction technique\", by four adult \"carers\", Rickwood, 5ft 1in and 7st 7lb, bled for an hour afterwards. Six hours later he hanged himself with his shoelaces, and in doing so became the youngest person to die by their own hand in penal custody in living memory. Pertinently there was no countrywide outcry after Adam Rickwood's death. A number of articles appeared in the press, notably in the Guardian. But otherwise it was just another prison news item. </p> <p>For me, our response to Adam Rickwood's death summed up our attitude generally to children in this country. When they are babies they can do no wrong. We love them and cherish them, almost to the point of worshiping them. And why not? Babies deserve all the love in the world. But something happens as they grow, something changes in our attitudes towards them. It seems we forget so easily that how a child grows and develops is almost totally dependent on the circumstances it finds itself in when it is born, involuntarily, into this world. A baby has no choices. But as soon as the child begins to show non-conforming behaviour, we blame the child. And too often we resort to violence \u2013 whether it is \"reasonable chastisement\" as the Victorians called it, or \"mild smacking\" as described by Beverly Hughes. </p> <p>There should never be any condoning of child assault, as attempted by Hughes or anyone else. I believe it is this acceptance of \"mild smacking\" that led directly to our acceptance of the \"restraint technique\", used on Adam Rickwood by the so-called \"adult carers\" at Hassockfield. It is the same acceptance that has led to our record child prisoner population. In 2006, over 5,000 children aged between 15 and 17 entered prison; during 2005-06, 824 children under 15 were imprisoned, only 48 of whom were convicted of crimes considered \"grave\".</p> <p>Hughes fears criminalising \"smacking\" because she believes that \"most parents\" are in favour of it. But in this case she should be leading, not following. Legislation to ban smacking would send the message that all violence against children is wrong. Children everywhere deserve that much.</p>",
  "<p>There's a magpie-like quality to Dead Space, which one feels obliged to describe as a third-person action-adventure survival-horror game set in space. At first, it's a bit overwhelming, as it misappropriates a welter of ideas from other games: the gravity gun from Half-Life, the (occasional) ability to walk on walls and ceilings from Prey, and the ability to slow down time from Max Payne. Against the odds, though, everything eventually slips into place and what you're presented with is compelling, original gameplay. As Isaac Clarke, you're dispatched to the mining ship USG Ishimura; your brief to get its communications back online. But the crew have mutated into scary alien beasts which you can only kill by shooting their limbs off. Luckily, your weapons and spacesuit bring special abilities: aim at objects and freeze them temporarily using an ability called Stasis, and fly from surface to surface in zero-gravity areas, plus upgrade your favourite abilities by collecting Power Nodes. A great storyline unfolds as you go, and on top of the inventive puzzle-solving and fierce boss-battles, truly scary atmospherics round off a fine game.</p>",
  "<p>During cricket's controversial series between Australia and India in January Shashi Tharoor, who used to be Kofi Annan's deputy at the United Nations, fell into conversation with a countryman who happened also to be one of Indian cricket's chief power brokers. Wasn't this all rather unedifying, Tharoor wondered aloud. Surely cooler heads should prevail. His interlocutor harrumphed: \"Why should we not behave like America at the WTO?\"</p> <p>So the Board of Control for Cricket in India, never knowingly outflounced, did - and so it has again this week in rendering Sri Lanka's tour of England next year unworkable. David Morgan might regard the $70m (\u00a339.9m) that Lalit Modi has dangled before Sri Lanka Cricket as \"quite unacceptable\" to the International Cricket Council but this, as so often, leaves the game's ostensible governing body in a squirming minority.</p> <p>So, too, is the England and Wales Cricket Board hemmed in that little bit tighter. For which country's cricketers will be content to accept second billing in an English summer when they can see their names up in the razzle-dazzling Indian Premier League lights? The ECB also gets its comeuppance for decades of neglect: Sri Lanka, in their quarter century as a Test nation, have been granted only 10 Tests in England.</p> <p>In fact, Modi has played a blinder, at a time when many boards of control must be experiencing pangs of financial insecurity. Sri Lanka Cricket has been in peril since the 2004 tsunami. A bomb explosion in Colombo in August 2006 sent the South Africans scurrying for cover. At the start of the year the organisation was living on its overdraft.</p> <p>While the ICC carried on its weighty work designating the correct size for logos on thigh pads and distributing plastic bats to the Inuit, the BCCI stepped in, offering its team to tour - effectively a bail-out of a simplicity Hank Paulson could only envy. Now comes the recapitalisation. Enjoying the privilege that attaches to any self-perpetuating autocracy, for it has nobody to please but itself, the BCCI has acted with quicksilver opportunism.</p> <p>Modi's manoeuvre extends his country's role in the finances of cricket. It is already acknowledged as the game's powerhouse, showering those in its favour with wealth (cricket in Pakistan lives on the proceeds of its sub-continental rivalry) while those at arms' length trade at a relative disadvantage (a group into which England looks more and more like falling, what with those winter appointments in Omigoditsbad and Guwheretheytellme). Even in Australia the Ashes now pales by financial comparison with visits to and from India.</p> <p>The multi-million dollar endowment for Sri Lanka Cricket projects the BCCI into a new position: that of cricket's lender of last resort. And Sri Lanka, of course, is far from alone in having rising expenses to meet and restive cricketers to placate: more benefactions are perfectly possible. Pretty soon, one fancies, May will be parcelled up and sold off in 20-over instalments only.</p> <p>There is an element of history repeating here. Cricket's propagation was once a featured dimension of England's imperial mission and there were financial incentives on offer then too: Lord Sheffield's endowment was turned into a shield for which Australian states have recently begun to play again. That this mission did not survive the empire's dissolution left the leadership vacuum that the ICC has repeatedly, abjectly failed to fill.</p> <p>The parallels, however, take one only so far. Marylebone Cricket Club was prepared to incur losses on its tours for the sake of imperial relations. The BCCI is spending money with an eye to the commercial end of protecting its lucrative Twenty20 franchise, securing IPL's flank in Sri Lanka against the kind of incursion engineered by its rival Indian Cricket League in Bangladesh. It is naked power politics, as well as some shrewd and tough-minded business - a blend, in fact, that would not be out of place at the World Trade Organisation. Against the BCCI's imperatives the ECB's ability to secure short, inbound tours in the first two months of the season hardly stood a chance. </p> <p><strong>Pace of today's game leaves slow bowling in a spin</strong></p> <p>If Indian cricket off the field has changed radically, so has it on the field. The days when spin was decisive seem long ago: only six wickets fell in 200 slow overs in the first Test between India and Australia in Bangalore. Spin, in fact, doesn't seem to be accomplishing much anywhere. It has taken Anil Kumble more than 100 deliveries to dismiss each of his Test victims this year; Harbhajan Singh's last 75 Test wickets have cost 41 apiece. Australia's spinning stocks haven't been thinner in 20 years.</p> <p>Cricket seems, quietly, to have returned to the bleak and sterile 1970s and 80s after the renaissance in slow bowling during the 1990s. In Australia excessive concentration on shorter forms of cricket is being blamed. There should be \"a thousand Shane Warnes running all over the country,\" complained his paterfamilias, Terry Jenner, a few weeks ago. \"All this one-day cricket and coaches and captains not wanting bowlers to concede runs has changed it all. For the redevelopment of spin bowlers it has to be accepted that they are going to be scored off heavily every now and again.\"</p> <p>There is some truth to this: 20 runs off a pace bowler's over is considered to reflect badly on the pace bowler; 20 runs off a slow bowler's over is seen as reflecting on slow bowling in general. But there are other reasons for spin's eclipse, especially pitches increasingly reminiscent of linoleum walkways and the prodigies of reverse swing, which keeps fast bowlers relevant throughout the innings. Spin won't recede: 90 overs in a day is unobtainable without slow bowling. Perhaps, though, Warne's legacy will not be thousands of imitators but the opposite: a huge, unrectifiable absence and unrequitable longing.</p> <p><strong>After Twenty20 the Test is silence</strong></p> <p>Probably the slowest ball of the Test was the one from Mitchell Johnson which Sachin Tendulkar, after three majestic boundaries, cuffed to point. Indian crowds claim to be the world's noisiest but Chinnaswamy Stadium fell as silent as Lenin's Tomb. Melbourne in 1933 on the downfall of Bradman, or Headingley 20 years later on the usurpation of Hutton, both for ducks, could not have been so hushed. You could probably mount an argument for Test cricket's grandeur based on its capacity for engendering quiet, a phenomenon to which Twenty20 is, as yet, a stranger.</p> <p><strong>Road to Oz is paved with gold for private profiteers</strong></p> <p>Australia is considering a bid to hold the 2018 football World Cup - an act of some optimism when 2010 and 2014 are already scheduled for the southern hemisphere. Special reports are rolling in about the huge and manifest economic benefits. What is puzzling, as so often, is why, if the benefits are so obvious, private capital doesn't pay for the lot and why taxpayers are lined up to do all the heavy lifting. Even where sport is concerned, it seems, the state is expected to underwrite corporate profit. Will that change in the general financial reckoning that seems to impend? In London's Olympics lies the answer.</p>",
  "<p>Pierre Laval was shot to-day at 12.32 after a vain attempt to poison himself had delayed his execution. [Laval had been Vichy prime minister, detested notably for a scheme by which one French prisoner of war was released for every three French skilled workers sent to work in Germany. He was convicted of treason.]</p> <p>When his advocates told him last night that General de Gaulle would not commute the sentence or the Minister of Justice order a retrial, Laval had been composed and cheerful. When this morning at 8.45am, Mornet, the Procurator General, came to him to inform him that he was to be executed at 9.30, Laval was lying in bed.</p> <p>Without replying, he put his head under the blankets. His advocates thought that he had had a moment of weakness and one of them raised the blanket to ask him to master himself, but saw at once from Laval's appearance that he must have taken poison. He was already losing consciousness. He had in fact drunk from a bottle of cyanide of potassium which he still held, but in his hurry he had not drained the bottle and had not shaken it before drinking. Immediate medical attention prevented his attempted suicide, and half an hour later Laval was again conscious. A letter by his bedside ran as follows: </p> <p>To my advocates - for their information: to my executioners - for their shame. I refuse to be killed by French bullets. I will not make French soldiers accomplices in a judicial murder. I have chosen my death - the poison of the Romans, which I have carried with me through my long wanderings and which has escaped the searchings of my guards.</p> <p>I wish to be buried with the Tricolour scarf round my neck. I die because I loved my country too much. My last thought is for France.</p> <p>While Laval was being restored to the degree of consciousness required by French law for a man to be executed, the firing squad was brought from the Fort of Chatillon, where the execution was originally to have taken place, to the prison at Fresnes. Laval put on one of the white ties which he had worn for years and wrapped the Tricolour scarf round his neck. </p> <p>Arrived at the place of execution, he said to the Procurator General, \"I pity you for the work you have done.\" Turning to the soldiers he said, \"I pity you for having to execute this crime. Aim at my heart. Long live France!\" At his request his eyes were not bandaged, but he was not allowed to give the order to fire.</p>",
  "<p>The cash-strapped American insurance company AIG has been ordered to \"cease and desist\" improper use of taxpayers' money, after senior executives flew by private jet to a partridge hunting party at a 17th century English manor house.</p> <p>New York state's attorney general, Andrew Cuomo, yesterday accused AIG of breaking the law by bankrolling \"unwarranted and outrageous\" junkets in the wake of a $123bn bail-out by the US government to save the firm from bankruptcy. </p> <p>\"The party is over,\" he said at a press conference. \"No more hunting trips. No more luxury resorts. They are not going to have the party and leave the hangover for taxpayers.\"</p> <p>A Sunday newspaper revealed that a group of AIG's European bosses spent more than \u00a350,000 on a trip to Plumber Manor in Dorset to shoot birds last week, with several executives using a private plane to travel from Germany. The getaway came hot on the heels of a $440,000 retreat for insurance salesmen at a beach resort in California.</p> <p>In a letter to AIG's board of directors, Cuomo said such expenditures could be deemed fraudulent conveyances under New York law. \"The board should immediately cease and desist these improper and extravagant expenditures, which exploit the taxpayers,\" said the letter. \"Immediate cooperation is expected, or we will commence legal action.\"</p> <p>He demanded that the AIG board stop \"unwarranted and outrageous expenditures\" and recover any past ones that were \"unreasonable\", citing a $5m bonus and $15m \"golden parachute\" that AIG awarded Martin Sullivan, its chief executive, in March. Beset by billions of dollars in liabilities on insurance policies protecting financial organisations against default on investments, AIG teetered on the brink of collapse last month. The Federal Reserve bailed out the firm with an $85bn emergency loan. Last week, the insurer was granted a further $38bn credit line to avert any further deterioration in its finances.</p> <p>An AIG spokesman told Bloomberg News that the events ought not to have happened: \"The events referred to should have been cancelled. It's regrettable they weren't. We've issued a policy cancelling all such events.\"</p> <p>AIG aims to sell businesses to raise funds to pay back the government's loans. But a former boss, Hank Greenberg, warned this week that the company could struggle to come up with sufficient money, and that it runs the risk of eventual liquidation.</p>",
  "<p>In television's early days, the producer did everything from choosing the play or the topic to calling the shots as the show went out on the air. Only with the spread of video pre-recording in the 1960s and the adoption of film studio practices did the role of director emerge. It was he or she who now framed every scene you saw.</p> <p>So what was left for the producer to do? The short answer was that his remained the main creative responsibility. Producers still chose or commissioned the script, supervised the casting and determined the whole tenor of the final work. But few exercised this function with the instinct, understanding and tenacity brought to it by Mark Shivas, who has died aged 70 of cancer.</p> <p>No better example springs to mind than one which Shivas himself instanced on these pages earlier this year when paying tribute to Anthony Minghella (obituary, March 19). In 1985, Minghella, then known only as an occasional contributor to television series, brought him the script of a serial about a failed marriage and access to children. The father was allowed only one or two visits a week, when he would take the children to the park - hence the title, What If It's Raining? It was not the most alluring of subjects, but Shivas saw instantly that it was recognisable, touching and wryly funny. He put it into production there and then for Channel 4.</p> <p>At the time of its screening (July 1986), I described the programme as \"at once the truest and tritest, freshest and stalest, most boring and most gripping fiction of the summer. The voices ... utter dialogue so natural, so free from added histrionics, that it must come from the wholefood counter at Sainsbury's. What If It's Raining brings back to television some of the old virtues which have been blotted out by the lurid super-soaps.\"</p> <p>Born in Banstead, Surrey, where his father was an English teacher and his mother a librarian, Shivas was educated at Whitgift school, Croydon, and read law at Merton College, Oxford. His initial contact with the scenic arts was as a critic and assistant editor for Movie magazine (1962-64), which also paid some attention to television, especially the spontaneous real-life drama which, despite being known as cinema-verit\u00e9, was seen chiefly on television. A high point of his time on the magazine was interviewing Claude Chabrol.</p> <p>In 1963, he landed a job as assistant to the head of the story department at Granada Television, followed by his appointment as a director-producer (1965-68), with a sideline as one of the presenters of Cinema, Granada's weekly review of new movies. At BBC Television, he was a producer of drama (1969-88), head of drama (1988-93) and head of films (1993-97). His last full-time appointment was with Southern Pictures (1979-81), though he continued to produce cinema and TV films, particularly for Channel 4.</p> <p>For the BBC alone, the enduring achievements bearing his credit include The Six Wives of Henry VIII (1970), Dennis Potter's Casanova (1971), Jack Rosenthal's semi-autobiographical The Evacuees (1975), Frederic Raphael's The Glittering Prizes and Geoffrey Household's Rogue Male (both 1976), Tom Stoppard's hilarious football-and-politics fusion, Professional Foul (1977), Telford's Change (1979) by Brian Clark, and Marjorie Wallace's uplifting and moving story of a thalidomide child, On Giant's Shoulders (1979). More recently came Cambridge Spies (2003), examining the milieu of Burgess, Maclean, Philby and Blunt.</p> <p>For Channel 4, a landmark ahead of What If It's Raining? was a co-production with RTE in Ireland to yield The Price (1985), a subdued six-part thriller about an industrialist kidnapped and held to ransom by the IRA. </p> <p>In the cinema, Alan Bennett's very funny tale A Private Function (1984) was set in the austerity years immediately after the second world war, when rationing was even grimmer than it had been during hostilities. Maggie Smith presided imperiously over the apportionment of a deceased pig - \"very British\", said a bemused American critic. The flawless little romantic fantasy Truly, Madly, Deeply (1990), written by Minghella, starring Juliet Stevenson and Alan Rickman, was released successfully on the cinema circuit, with a television airing for the BBC's Screen Two series almost contemporaneously. </p> <p>Other feature films ranged in mood from The Witches (1990) to Enchanted April (1992), or from the harrowing account of Siegfried Sassoon's mental plight from his time in the trenches of the first world war in Regeneration (1987) and Esther Freud's tale of two sisters and their hippy mother on the road from London to Morroco, Hideous Kinky (1998), to I Capture the Castle (2003), from Dodie Smith's novel (and West End matinee dramatisation) set in a dotty English stately home.</p> <p>Over the years Shivas won three Baftas, two Emmys and a Prix Italia, this last for The Six Wives of Henry VIII. Italy was one of his abiding passions, as were swimming and cycling. In 2005, he set up his own production company, Headline Pictures. He leaves his civil partner of 11 years, Karun Thakar.</p> <p><strong>Alan Bennett writes ... </strong>Mark Shivas looked more like a don than a producer, and not at all like someone from the world of entertainment. But quiet and self-effacing though he was, he could be tough. He had the quality writers want in a producer: he was on your side and shielded you from interference by the bureaucracy and the money.</p> <p>A Private Function was not an easy film to make, and not merely because of the pig(s). The financier, Denis O'Brien, had little faith in the project. He cut its budget to the bone before shooting started, and went on cutting while shooting was going on. Mark had to salvage the film from O'Brien's cuts, and from the consequent fury of the director, Malcolm Mowbray, and myself. Had we had someone less diplomatic, the film would never have been finished. Watching it, one sees the scars, but without Mark there would have been no film to watch.</p> <p>The only other project we did together, Talking Heads 2 in 1998, was altogether happier, and it was a tribute to Mark that Thora Hird took the trouble to remember his name. She usually called all producers and directors by the generic name of Mr De Grunwald. But Mark wouldn't have minded that either.</p> <p><strong>Ronald Harwood writes ... </strong>I knew Mark Shivas for almost 30 years, but I realise now that I didn't really know him at all. Private and reticent, qualities unusual in a film and television producer, he was, in my professional life, unquestionably the most concealed person I have met. Not, I am sure, because he had any dark secrets to hide. It was simply that he shunned personal publicity or saw no need for it, and seemed determined to avoid talking about himself in any revealing way. </p> <p>Slight and quietly spoken, he gave the impression of being either a little weary or, more often than not, secretly amused by life. Yet he exuded confidence, both in his own abilities and whatever project he happened to be overseeing. </p> <p>We first met in the early 1970s, when he was asked to produce and I to write a film about Maria Callas. I remember flying with him to New York on Concorde and going to see a Broadway musical that evening. We both fell asleep in the theatre. The film was never made. </p> <p>We lost touch till a little over a year ago, when Tom Courtenay asked if I thought it a good idea to make a film of my play, Quartet, about four elderly, retired opera singers. He had seen the play in London and thought he would be good casting for the tenor, while Albert Finney would be ideal as the extrovert baritone. And what about Maggie Smith for the grande dame soprano? My agent, Judy Daish, had known Mark for 40 years, and suggested we approach him.</p> <p>He was immediately enthusiastic - but no, that may be too strong a word to describe his reaction; even cautiously encouraging may be a little strong. He said he would do his best to raise the funds to pay for the development of the screenplay. No progress reports came until, at last, he announced that BBC Films were interested. I then set about writing the screenplay. The only time Mark betrayed modest pleasure was when I delivered it. I was told later that he was genuinely excited, but his responses were never unnecessarily exuberant. The film is scheduled to begin shooting next year.</p> <p>In June, he came to visit me in West Sussex, keen to get down to the nitty-gritty of producing Quartet. He refused lunch and departed. A few weeks ago he telephoned to say he had been diagnosed with lung cancer. He gave the news in a flat, unemotional voice: no drama, no self-pity, just the fact. </p> <p>He wanted so much, I believe, to make it possible for the film to be made in the best of circumstances. My fervent wish is that we don't let him down.</p> <p><strong>Kevin Hood writes ... </strong>The Headline chapter of Mark's career began when he met Stewart Mackinnon at a film festival and told him he was thinking about winding down, maybe writing a book between film projects. Set up a film company instead, said Stewart, and so Headline began - the name, like so much else, coming from Mark. </p> <p>He was a distinguished man three times over. He knew everybody - from Maggie and Jake Gyllenhaal as babies and as adults, to Saul Zaentz, via Anthony Minghella, Dennis Potter, Michael Palin, Frederick Raphael and on and on, hundreds of them. They all respected him, they all liked him and the vast majority admired him. </p> <p>Unusually, Mark was a serious player who didn't take himself seriously. On one occasion, in BBC drama, a young woman asked if he had been there before. He smiled sweetly, shrugged, and said \"once or twice\", and she never guessed. Mark showed a special delicacy with young people. He understood them, their uncertainties and hopes. Perhaps remembering his own early years, he took time out to encourage, to guide, to recognise, to warn, to laugh with, to celebrate, and he did it for decades. </p> <p>For all this he was no softie. He could get angry and sharp when the occasion demanded. His put-downs were often very much to the point, often funny and usually deserved. A warm man, witty and wise, he had just enough salt in his character to stop him being a saint and make him terrific company. There was no one you wanted to make laugh more.</p> <p>\u2022 Mark Shivas, film and television producer, born April 24 1938; died October 11 2008</p>",
  "<p>You can almost hear the thought process behind Madonna's red-carpet footwear. \"OK, those pesky tabloids won't stop with my whole divorce thing and my film's about to get panned.

That'll get them talking.\"</p> <p>The break-up rumours have been swirling for some months, but this time Madonna's people have confirmed it: the Ritchie marriage is over. Alas, these shoes are not a goodbye gift commissioned by gangster-obsessed Guy Ritchie to toast his wife on the eve of her directorial debut, Filth and Wisdom, or even some promotional tat issued by her film company to coincide with its premiere.</p> <p>Known as \"The Miami Vice\", the shoes are by Chanel, were designed by Karl Lagerfeld, and will go on sale for the princely sum of \u00a3900 very soon.</p> <p>Unusual heels are very au courant in fashion - in recent seasons we've had teacup heels, upside-down heels and even high heels with no actual heel.

The singer/director wouldn't be the first person in the world to use shoes to convey a subliminal message. Remember that Gwyneth Paltrow's silent announcement that she was no longer a stay-at-home mum came via the medium of the high heel? So what is Madonna saying with these gun heels? Just who is she threatening - Guy's lawyer or the film critics? Time will tell.</p>",
  "<p>American investigators have shut down an international criminal network they claim is responsible for up to a third of all spam emails on the internet. </p> <p>After a long investigation by the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and police in other countries, courts in Chicago and New Zealand ordered the assets of Australia-based New Zealander Lance Atkinson and Texas-based Jody Smith to be frozen. They are accused of making millions of dollars by bombarding people with emails offering non-regulated drugs and fake medical remedies. </p> <p>The duo are believed to be part of a group called the HerbalKing gang, who have sent enormous numbers of spam messages over the past three years. </p> <p>\"The defendants recruited spammers around the world to send billions of spam messages,\" the FTC said in a statement. \"Their enterprise included participants in Australia, New Zealand, China, Russia, Canada and the United States.\" </p> <p>According to FTC officials, the duo used spam emails to promote drugs for sexual dysfunction, penis enlargement and weight loss - which were sold without a licence or did not live up to their claims. </p> <p>Atkinson and Smith are believed to have used a string of up to 35,000 hacked computers - known as a \"botnet\" - around the world to send as many as 10bn spam messages a day. Three million complaints have been made about their messages. </p> <p>Documents filed in the legal case name the pair, as well as four companies they control. A sequence of injunctions and restraining orders prevents them from continuing to do business while legal proceedings are under way.</p> <p>According to the campaigning organisation Spamhaus, HerbalKing has been operating since at least 2005 and was ranked as the most prolific spam gang last year. </p> <p>Atkinson and his brother Shane have been involved previously in cases brought under America's Can-Spam Act, which makes it illegal to send large amounts of unsolicited email.

  "<p>Katharine Whitehorn (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/13/usa-healthandwellbeing\">How to die 'the Oregon way'</a>, G2, October 13) raises the issue but also describes a major problem. The Oregon way denies choice to people like me. I have MS and have been unable to walk for five years, and have no arm function. If I was not helped by paid carers and members of my family, I would starve to death in my own excrement because I cannot move. </p> <p>I have been a member of Dignitas for some years because it enables me to think that I do not have to tolerate the intolerable, but I chose not to go when I could go independently, and it is now too late to avoid implicating others in a possible charge of manslaughter. I am not considered terminally ill; I could live for years yet. Assisted suicide, whether by physician or anybody else, I see as helping me to do something I cannot do for myself, much as I am helped to move, eat, drink and be toileted. Suicide is no longer illegal. For me it would be the last act of autonomy I could make.</p> <p>Is there anybody who would join me in campaigning for a change in the law on this basis?<br><strong>Meg Taylor</strong><br>London</p> <p>It is vital that we as a society, and parliament specifically, take Katharine Whitehorn up on her challenge to rethink \"the end of life as we have rethought the beginning\". </p> <p>As a society we quite rightly promote a system that allows mothers to plan the birth of their child based on informed choice. Why is it, then, that when we are dying our system so often implements a one-size-fits-all approach?</p> <p>People want choice, control and access to services at the end of life. Alongside better end-of-life care and treatment, terminally ill adults in unbearable suffering should have the option of an assisted death, within strict legal safeguards. This is not a choice between permitting assisted dying or banning it. It's a choice between regulating it or underground practices continuing. As the experience of Oregon, Belgium and other jurisdictions shows, it should not be beyond the wisdom of our parliamentarians to create a more compassionate system that promotes choice while protecting vulnerable people. <br><strong>Sarah Wooton</strong><br>Chief executive, Dignity in Dying</p> <p>What a lucid and compassionate article by Katharine Whitehorn. The sad thing about the controversy over physician-assisted dying is that those who oppose it cannot meet the arguments head-on and have to resort to misrepresentation or ignoring them altogether. The example of Oregon proves that it is possible to build into legislation adequate safeguards. Over the 10 years that the law has been in force there, the horror stories about vulnerable people being coerced into committing suicide have failed to materialise; they are nothing more than scare tactics.<br><strong>Malcom Hurwitt</strong><br>London</p>",
  "<p>The City is revolting. It wants Royal Bank of Scotland and a merged Lloyds TSB-HBOS to have the freedom to pay dividends on their ordinary shares. The Treasury's plan is too punishing, it is argued. Look how gentle the US authorities are being with their banks, who will pay a fixed interest rate of 5% on the preference shares sold to the state, not the 12% rate as in Britain. </p> <p>This grumble was predictable and the Treasury seems inclined to retreat from Monday's terms in one important area: a one-year ban on dividends appears likely to remain in force, but RBS and Lloyds-HBOS could then negotiate to resume payments thereafter, even if they haven't repaid the preference shares. But there would be a negotiation. The banks would have offer taxpayers something in return. For example, they could sell assets to improve their capital ratios further, thereby reducing the risks to the taxpayer.</p> <p>Fair enough, but let's hope this compromise is not the first of many, because the broad principles of Monday's rescue plan are correct. So what if the US is seeking a coupon of 5% on its preference shares? Those are sweetheart terms and there is no reason to copy them. The market price for bank preference shares is a coupon of about 9% to 12% and the taxpayer deserves to receive the going rate.</p> <p>Moreover, placing restrictions on dividend payments seems reasonable. The taxpayer could be investing \u00a337bn here. Part of the capital is designed to be a buffer against future write-offs; but the other purpose is to encourage banks to start lending again. We don't want the surplus capital to sit idly within banks' balance sheets or to be siphoned off to satisfy current shareholders. The banks must get back to performing their essential role of transmitting money around the economy and allocating financial resources efficiently. That's how a market system operates.</p> <p>Everybody knows what sits behind this argy-bargy over dividends - it is Lloyds's problem in convincing its own shareholders that the HBOS takeover is worthwhile. But, as matters stand, it is Lloyds's problem, not the Treasury's. Lloyds had the chance to wriggle out of the deal at the weekend and chose not to. Yes, it is performing a useful service by buying HBOS, but let's not forget that it has been given a sweetener in the form of a waiver from scrutiny by the competition authorities.</p> <p>Of course, the Treasury would have to pick up the pieces if Lloyds shareholders vote down the deal, probably by nationalising HBOS, but we're not there yet. So, yes, allow Lloyds to apply to pay dividends in a year's time if it helps the HBOS takeover to proceed without a hitch. But there is no reason to soften the terms of the rescue package further. The banks, and their shareholders, have to understand that there is cost to be paid for guaranteed support from the state.</p> <p><strong>Turning nasty</strong></p> <p>As the banking crisis recedes, the news from the real economy turns nasty. The economic slowdown in China is already so sharp that Rio Tinto, one of the world's biggest miners, is considering cutting capital expenditure. If you are optimistic, like Rio, you will argue that a slowdown in China from growth of 12% to 9% next year is hardly a disaster from a long-term perspective. But will 9% really be achieved?</p> <p>Many economists are expecting a lower figure, because the notion that China could \"decouple\" from the slowdown in the west seems weaker by the day. It is clear that Chinese economy is still dependent on exports, however much we would like to believe that its consumers could fill the hole in spending that will be left by shoppers in the US and Europe. That route to global recovery seems closed, not least because the Chinese authorities see the need to control credit in their own economy. </p> <p>For the likes of Rio, the immediate future looks uncertain. Its shares have fallen two-thirds from their peak, roughly in line with the sector. Prices of industrial metals are falling and, in the case of aluminium, have already dropped below levels where high-cost producers can earn a profit. Copper may soon be close to that point too.</p> <p>Miners always tell us that, when prices drop to the marginal cost of production, a floor should be established because high-cost producers are forced to close. Life rarely works so simply, however. In practice, state-subsidised producers always seem to cling on longer than the models say they should.</p> <p>None of which destroys the long-term bullish case for commodities, which is built on the demand that China and India will generate as they industrialise. One school of thought says that miners' cuts in capital expenditure today will feed a new commodities boom in five years' time. That is possible. But five years is a long time to wait. No wonder investors are fleeing the mining sector: the next two years look very difficult.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:nils.pratley@theguardian.com\">nils.pratley@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The City and Wall Street face far more than a dire financial crisis. For underlying it is, literally, a demoralisation of the markets and their players. The real \"moral hazard\" is far deeper than the damage to capitalist theory from the state bailing out surfeited losers. The question now is whether more regulation can stop the pack of cards collapsing again.</p> <p>The City has probably never been very ethical. Insider dealing, for example, has always been a scourge. But when I went there as a young lawyer in 1964 it was not as detached, arrogant and doctrinaire as it is now. Firms were much smaller (partnerships limited to 20), more stable and often independent. Above all, personal reputation - ethical as well as functional - meant everything. It was a powerful constraint on conduct. The City take- over panel, for example, functioned well without any statutory backing.</p> <p>Today ethical reputation and peer pressure are enfeebled. For example, many top investment banks - Lehman Brothers and Goldman Sachs among them - were convicted of extensive dotcom frauds but their businesses were scarcely affected. And when KPMG in the US was convicted three years ago of conspiring with clients to defraud the Internal Revenue Service, KPMG UK continued to garner government contracts. Under pressure, ends too often justify means (short selling et al). Hyper-cleverness too easily trumps probity (eg AIG).</p> <p>These developments stem partly from global markets dominated by huge, faceless corporations, with declining loyalty to anyone or anything. Ownership of City firms, once fiercely cherished, is now a matter of almost universal indifference so long as the bonuses or dividends are right. The basis of shareholding has been generally reduced to brute concern about returns and gains. In such a climate of non-concern, can one be surprised at rampant amorality.</p> <p>Of course people remain people and many struggle to soften the extremes of capitalist fundamentalism and the growing disconnectedness from the societies they service. The latter starts with intense competitiveness within and between firms which demands obsessional commitment, leaving little time for family, friends and hinterland, let alone the public realm. Imbalanced, over-narrow lives do not engender ethical sensitivity. The City has thus become a ghetto where greed (never mentioned) is all but an absolute good, selfishness applauded and altruism banished, except from corporate social responsibility programmes which, frankly, are invariably marginal.</p> <p>The cry since the crisis took hold has been for more regulation. Yet the City today is regulated more heavily than ever before. The financial services and companies legislation plus a plethora of related controls (many deriving from the EU) run to many thousands of pages and have spawned a new bureaucracy overseen by the FSA and underpinned by armies of lawyers and accountants. Some think the goose is already half-dead. </p> <p>As one who has sat on each side of the triangular regulatory table - as lawyer, legislator and City company director - I assert that better regulation can only be a limited part of any deliverable answer. Look at non-financial crime. If more legislation was the cure, we would by now be crime-free. Ironically, the very accretion of regulation over recent years has seriously weakened the organic will of the City to effectively police and address its own ills.

  "<p>It was worrying last week that, after the announcement of the Brown package, the UK stock market simply slid further. It is even more worrying this week, that after the unprecedented and coordinated action between Europe and the US produced such positive worldwide market reactions, the markets were so weak yesterday. It is like a horror movie. Just when you thought it was safe to go out ...</p> <p>Fear is migrating from prospects of financial meltdown to more general economic concerns about production and employment, highlighted by yesterday's British unemployment statistics. The narrow unemployment \"claimant count\" measure - those out of work and eligible to claim unemployment benefit - jumped to 940,000 and will plainly top a million next month. The wider measure - those out of work - leapt to 1.8 million. It now looks set to top two million by Christmas.</p> <p>So as the London interbank offered rate begins to ease, suggesting that the markets are beginning to thaw, and credit default swap rates fall, indicating that the markets believe governments will really stand behind their banks, the emerging rival locus of uncertainty is the real economy. German forecasters said yesterday that their country is on the brink of recession; Wall Street was frightened by the biggest fall in retail sales for three years. The markets are once again beset by nameless fears.</p> <p>It's a similar story everywhere, but Britain is a special case. The famine in mortgage finance has meant that mortgages and transactions are running at an astounding fifth of the level of summer 2007 while prices slide 2% a month. Gazundering, the practice of lowering an agreed offer still further days or hours before completion (a cowboy practice not permitted in most other developed countries' property markets but which \"light touch\" regulation permits in England), means that achieved prices are 25% off their peak.</p> <p>But on top, as the chief executive of a leading retailer tells me, some members of his supply chain are warning him that by January and February they will no longer have sufficient working capital - nor credit lines - to sustain today's level of business. This is the dangerous feedback loop of diminished credit squeezing activity which then squeezes property prices that in turn causes a further squeeze on the banking system - and so a fresh cycle of decline/debt deflation that even having the taxpayer as part-owner of the banks does not prevent. </p> <p>Which is why the fashionable insouciance about the property market - it will make housing more affordable and a fall was long overdue - is so crass. If house prices halve, a prospect that is no longer outlandish, consumption on most economic models will fall by between 9% and 10% over the next two years. Housing may become affordable. But the circumstances will be an additional two million out of work and a wholly nationalised banking system.</p> <p>Which is why the government, while completely right to take stakes in the banks, has been wrong to do it so punitively while at the same washing its hands of the consequences. Nobody has any sympathy with Sir Fred Goodwin, the ousted chief of RBS whose ego so betrayed his business, but he was right (as reported to me) to tell Paul Myners, who led the Treasury negotiating team, that the whole affair smelt more of \"a drive-by shooting than a negotiation\". The Treasury has wanted it both ways: it wants the banks to lend at 2007 levels even as it kicks them in the teeth by insisting on stringent terms for a temporary investment. The banks' priority will be to get rid of the usurious 12% preference shares by contracting their balance sheets as fast as possible rather than, say, kickstarting the housing market. </p> <p>This is ownership without responsibility. The government should have insisted instead that every bank accept a public stake and brushed off Barclays' and HSBC's special pleading that, according to FSA \"stress tests\" they did not need the cash. It should then have sought a grand bargain, fair terms for what it considers a long-term rather than transient investment, together with a commitment from the banks they would work closely with their new principal owner to price their medium- and long-term loans - with appropriate government guarantees - so attractively that credit would flow. It should talk less about punishment, irresponsibility and ending the bonus culture; more about how we are going to get out of this mess.</p> <p>Nor will this happen without big cuts in interest rates - and cleverly targeted tax cuts and spending increases. Bank of England governor Mervyn King has consistently overestimated the danger of wage inflation - even publicly mocking fellow MPC member David Blanchflower for his gloomy but correct assessment - and underestimated the strength of recessionary forces. His stance is undermining the legitimacy of the Bank's independence. The danger is that by waiting too long to cut rates, a ferocious debt deflation will be unleashed. Inflation, even above 2%, will be seen as a necessary boon. The Brown plan marked the end of the beginning. But the government, and the rest of G7, will have to show much more imagination if we are to limit this contagion.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:will.hutton@observer.co.uk\">will.hutton@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Japan is no longer the force it once was in the global videogame industry - and a lot of its executives are asking themselves why. In May, Metal Gear Solid creator Hideo Kojima admitted that Japanese development had fallen a few paces behind the west. And just last week, Yoichi Wada, president of Square Enix, the publisher of the Final Fantasy series, also noted that Japan is no longer the market leader. What could explain such a fall from grace?</p> <p>It's all about the PC. In Japan, there's really no mass consumer market for home computers - people are more likely to check email or surf the web on their phones, and will play games on consoles or handhelds. But the easy availability of cheap PCs, together with a strongly collaborative online community, has revolutionised game development in the west. This began in the mid 1990s, when the creators of first-person shooters like Doom, Unreal and Half-Life made their development tools available to fans. Quickly, bedroom coders started designing their own levels, swapping ideas via the internet and forming mini-development studios to build ever more elaborate content. Game developers were thrilled - the community input gave their games longevity. None of this could have happened in a culture where home coding on a cheap PC was not particularly common.</p> <p>We're seeing a new phase of the home coding revolution. On the indie scene, small groups of home developers create simple downloadable or browser-based games and then distribute them via websites like Kongregate and Newgrounds. These games spread virally across the web, but they're also being picked up by the big console manufacturers. Two of this year's best Xbox Live games - platformer Braid and RPG action title Castle Crashers - come from the indie community; the next biggie will be daft scrolling fighter, Dishwasher: Dead Samurai by lone coder James Silva, who blogs about development at <a href=\"http://skasoftware.wordpress.com\">skasoftware.wordpress.com</a>. Meanwhile, just released on WiiWare in the US, World of Goo is a bizarre structure-modelling sim, originally conceived for the Experimental Gameplay Project.</p> <p>Japanese publishers do have a history of supporting important offbeat projects - LocoRoco, Katamari Damacy and Lumines spring to mind. However, these tend to be the work of well-positioned creative directors, working within \"legitimate\" internal studios. At the same time, Japan does have an indie games scene - the \"doujin shmup\" is a style of fast-paced scrolling shooter, created by small teams and distributed online - the best-known examples are the truly hypnotic Warning Forever and anything by Kenta Cho (<a href=\"http://bit.ly/gblog5\">bit.ly/gblog5</a>). </p> <p>The orthodox industry seems to be showing little interest in these upstarts - perhaps because of the lack of a PC culture. But if the two sectors can meet, form a community and start sharing ideas, Japan can rise again.</p>",
  "<p>A brain implant has allowed paralysed monkeys to move their limbs, by tapping into their thoughts and redirecting the signals to their muscles, scientists announced yesterday. The feat is being seen as a major development in the hunt for treatments for people who have lost the use of their limbs due to spinal cord injuries or strokes. </p> <p>Using the implant, doctors hope severely disabled people will in future be able to use mind control to regain movement in their arms and legs.</p> <p>The work is the first to show that signals from single brain cells can be rerouted around damaged areas of the central nervous system, and restore function to paralysed limbs. Previously, scientists have shown that monkeys fitted with brain implants can move robotic arms or cursors on a screen. </p> <p>Scientists involved in the experiments yesterday sought to damp down hopes of the technique being ready to help disabled people in the near future, but others said they expected to see the first human trials within five years. </p> <p>More advanced versions of the implant could give people with paralysed legs the ability to walk again, and eventually give paraplegics control over all of their limbs, including very precise movements of the hands and arms.</p> <p>In the study, which appears in the journal Nature, scientists at the University of Washington in Seattle implanted ultra thin electrodes into the brains of macaques which had been trained to play a game that involved rotating their wrists to the left and right. While the monkeys played, the electrodes picked up electrical signals in their brains that made them tense different muscles.</p> <p>The scientists then injected the monkeys with a chemical that temporarily paralysed their arms. This time, signals from nerves in their brains were fed into a computer, cleaned up and magnified, and sent down a wire to muscles in the monkeys' wrists.</p> <p>When the monkeys tried to play the game again, they were unable to at first, but soon learned to control their wrist movements using the brain implant. </p> <p>Astonishingly, even when the implant was connected to nerves that were not involved in wrist control, the monkeys could learn how to change their brain activity to control their actions.</p> <p>\"The monkey was experimenting with different types of movement and different types of cognitive activity to drive those neurons and when he found something worked, he quickly repeated it and adopted the strategy,\" said Eberhard Fetz, who led the study.</p> <p>Future work will focus on miniaturising the technology and developing wireless networks to send the brain's signals around damaged parts of the spine to limbs that have lost their connections to the brain.</p> <p>As it stands, researchers have several major hurdles to overcome before the system could safely be used in humans. The first is to remove the need for wires, which increase the risk of infection. The second problem is that when electrodes are put into the brain, they gradually become encapsulated by scar tissue, which reduces their ability to read signals from individual neurons. The study suggests, though, that as long as the electrodes have a good contact with at least one neuron, it will still be possible to control muscles.</p> <p>Chet Moritz, who also worked on the study, said the team was looking at a potentially more powerful way of using the implant to control paralysed limbs. Instead of redirecting brain signals to individual muscles, they can be sent into the spinal cord to stimulate several nerves that together trigger a group of muscles to do a specific job, such as grasp a mug, or kick a ball. </p> <p>\"If you stimulate directly in the spinal cord, that will often activate 10 to 15 muscles in a precise balance that produces a grasping movement or a stepping movement,\" Moritz said.</p> <p>Lee Miller, at Northwestern University in Chicago, who recently showed how monkeys could control their limbs using signals from bunches of brain cells, said: \"This is the first instance when activity from a single neuron in the brain has been used to control a paralysed limb rather than a robotic arm or a cursor on a screen. I'd certainly hope that within the next five years there will be at least experimental applications being tried out in humans.\"</p>",
  "<p>Scarborough and North East Yorkshire NHS Trust, which runs hospitals in Scarborough and Bridlington, was rated \"weak\" by the Healthcare Commission for both quality of services and use of resources for the second year running. It failed to meet the core standards assessment, falling short of full compliance in 12 out of 43 categories.</p> <p>Providing services not just for 220,000 Yorkshire coast residents but also the thousands of tourists who visit the area every year, the trust has long suffered from financial troubles and overspending. \"It has continued to be weak at managing its finances over the last three years,\" the Healthcare Commission said.</p> <p>In 2007 the trust's \u00a320m debt was set aside by the government but it still owes \u00a37.5m which it must now pay back over the next four years. In June the chief executive, finance director and non-executive director for auditing all quit. </p> <p>Interim chief executive Christine Green said: \"The trust's long-standing financial difficulties and history of poor budgetary control ... have resulted in us being marked as 'weak' in this area. </p> <p>\"The legacy of financial difficulties will, inevitably, take time to resolve.\" </p> <p>But the trust said improvements were already being made, with A&amp;E showing the best performance in the country against its four-hour waits target in September. A \u00a31.9m surplus, to help pay back the trust's debt, is predicted this year. \"We now have a clear focus on what action is needed to improve these ratings,\" Green said.</p>",
  "<p>Iceland rushed to stave off economic ruin yesterday by cutting interest rates by three and a half percentage points and pursuing talks with Russia over the possibility of a multibillion euro loan. </p> <p>But despite the cut, to bring the policy rate down from a record 15.5%, the country's central bank issued a bleak forecast, predicting Iceland's economic contraction would be \"very sharp\". </p> <p>The bank warned of numerous job losses and reduced market demand, noting: \"The Icelandic economy has been subjected to unprecedented turbulence in the past few weeks. The banking system has not been able to withstand the trials it has faced as a result of difficult market conditions. A variety of jobs have disappeared virtually in the blink of an eye; demand has declined precipitously.\"</p> <p>As Icelandic officials sat down with their Russian counterparts for a second day of bail-out negotiations in Moscow, the country drew on swap facilities with Denmark and Norway, tapping them each \u00a3150m to kick-start currency markets. </p> <p>The country has accepted a \u00a3100m loan from Britain to help it repay UK depositors in Landsbanki, one of the three Icelandic banks nationalised last week.</p> <p>Iceland is also due to present a plan to the International Monetary Fund over the next few days and is widely expected to seek funds further afield.</p> <p>The country has endured years of high interest rates as the central bank struggled to control inflation. A collapse of the Icelandic krona made things worse as Iceland is heavily dependent on imports.</p> <p>Asgeir Jonsson, an analyst at Kaupthing, which was nationalised along with Landsbanki and Glitnir last week, welcomed the rate cut. He said: \"It will help companies that will now have to be financed by Icelandic banks. Going forward, we will not see any serious inflation in 2009 given that 20% of the CPI [consumer price index] is the housing market. Labour unions have said they would be willing to accept a two-year wage freeze.\"</p> <p>While Iceland tried to shore up its economy, the British government announced it had sent emergency teams into three of the 116 local councils that have a total of \u00a3858m deposited in Icelandic banks. </p> <p>Thirteen local authorities said they may face short-term problems because of the blocked deposits, but ministers stressed there was \"no reason to think wages will not be paid or services could be at risk\". </p> <p>After talks this afternoon, the government and the Local Government Association released a joint statement saying they were working \"to get the best and most rapid resolution of the situation relating to Icelandic banks and the \u00a3858m\".</p> <p>Meanwhile, speculation mounted over the future of the Icelandic retail investor Baugur, whose UK interests include Hamley's, House of Fraser and Oasis. Although retail magnate Sir Philip Green had been regarded as favourite to snap up Baugur's \u00a31bn debt - and possibly its entire operation - reports suggest other potential buyers have emerged, among them equity groups TPG, Permira and Alchemy.</p>",
  "<p>Our bodies are being measured for critical comparison like never before. Biometric devices prevent gambling addicts from playing casinos and bar intruders from nurseries. And the border security of the western world could soon depend on an emerging technology that offers security solutions for a post-9/11 world tormented by fears of terrorism, fraud and crime.</p> <p>Computerised examinations of our wrinkly digital extremities, the peculiar shapes of our faces and uniquely patterned irises will be used more and more often to authenticate our use of our passports, ID cards, mobile phones and laptops - as well as regulating access to offices and building sites.</p> <p><strong>Too clever by half?</strong></p> <p>The science behind the industry is advancing rapidly. Two UK universities - Kent and Robert Gordon in Aberdeen - this year established specialist MSc courses in biometrics and security. False rejection rates - when machines fail to recognise pre-registered passengers or staff - are plummeting. But is there a danger that the ingenuity of these applications will outrun the capacity of this young technology? The moment of truth is about to arrive in the UK with deployment of the first major government biometric programmes: ID cards (initially for foreign workers) carrying fingerprint records will be launched next month, while automated immigration gates this summer began recognition checks on passengers carrying the new generation of passports arriving at Manchester airport. And next week, the biggest showcase for the industry in Europe, Biometrics 2008, opens in London (at the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre, Westminster, from October 21 to 23). A Home Office minister and European police officials will participate. More than ever, businesses are under to pressure to prove that the technology is both resilient and yet also politically sensitive.</p> <p>A research paper produced for the show by Simon France of the University of Kent and the UK Biometrics Institute, confirms that systems are becoming more complex to foil spoofing attacks (where people masquerade as others) and to reduce the error rate. The trend, he says, is to employ \"multimodal\" biometrics - security systems that incorporate several types of measurements. British passports now carry chips recording facial recognition data but will eventually add fingerprints. \"Liveness\" testing, to prevent fraud or spoofing, is increasingly built in. Iris scans, for example, check that the image of a human eye is from a convex surface, is glossy and/or wet and that the muscles oscillate at high frequency.</p> <p>There are still problems, France observes. \"Having a laboratory-based solution is one thing, but achieving acceptable failure rates in the real world can be quite another. Transitory changes [illness, damage] or permanent changes such as ageing can cause identification decisions to become invalid over time. Equally challenging is the presence of varying lighting conditions, dirt or moisture.\"</p> <p>In facial recognition systems - which are slowly being integrated into CCTV networks - research is turning to the addition of 3D images to boost performance. A Dutch scientist, Dr Arnout Ruifrok, will discuss at the show the problem that current technologies have difficulty interpreting non-frontal images and even zoomed-in on faces more than four metres from the camera. Iris recognition - a British technology invented by Professor John Daugman, a Cambridge scientist - is developing methods of reading the unique patterns in our eyes at a distance.</p> <p>Its accuracy helps pre-enrolled frequent flyers pass quickly through congested UK airport security checks. It has lost out, however, chiefly because so many existing police and identity databases already contain fingerprint and photographic records.</p> <p>Voice recognition, palm prints and ear shapes are also being pursued for commercial development. The global biometrics market, according to a pre-credit crunch estimate by ABI Research, is worth around $3bn (\u00a31.7bn) this year and will rise to $7.3bn by 2013.</p> <p>One measure of the improvement in biometric capabilities, according to Mark Lockie, editor of Biometric Technology Today and programme director of next week's conference, is the US series of face recognition vendor tests, which for the past 15 years have evaluated the latest systems. With a false acceptance level set at 0.001, initial tests in 1993 returned a false rejection rate of 79%. By 2002, the rejection rate had dropped to 20% and by 2006 was down to 1%.<br><strong><br>Socially acceptable </strong></p> <p>\"One issue that remains is the speed with which data can be downloaded from the computer chip [in UK passports],\" he says. \"Privacy is another matter. You can design biometric systems that enhance privacy. In the US, samples can be given for Aids tests along with fingerprints and collected by proving your identity without giving a name.\"</p> <p>The battle ahead for the industry may be more about gaining for social and political acceptance. The Conservatives say they will, if elected, ditch ID cards. Security agencies believe that to be effective, biometric records need to be matched across networks of international databases. Airport workers, on the front line of the new technology, remain to be convinced. </p> <p>The Guardian is the media partner of Biometrics 2008 <a href=\"http://www.biometrics.elsevier.com\">biometrics.elsevier.com</a></p>",

  "<p>It's impossible to walk into a room and not notice Jason Calacanis. This is not because he is famous - although he's arguably a celebrity in internet circles - but due to the fact that he exudes confidence and has a dominant presence. He might be perceived as little arrogant, but he's earned his authoritative position: he has held successive productive roles in the tech world for many years, seen it through the good times and bad and come out the other end a millionaire several times over. It's no surprise, then, that people pay attention to what he has to say.</p> <p>Calacanis describes himself as \"a nerd, geek and media guy\". A serial entrepreneur, he founded Silicon Alley Reporter magazine in 1996 and then in 2003 a group of blogs, Weblogs, Inc., which he sold to AOL in 2005 for a reported $25m. Nowadays he's a frequent blogger, has more than 35,000 Twitter followers and is the co-host of - as he puts it - the \"Sundance of Startups\", TechCrunch50, which is the public launchpad for emerging internet companies. He's also the chief executive of Mahalo, a \"human-powered\" search engine, which he says is an \"abridged Wikipedia with Google links, but built by humans\". At last week's Future of Web Apps conference in London, where he launched its live news blog features, we met to to talk about how he sees the future of tech.<br><strong><br>Small is beautiful</strong></p> <p>\"Companies are going to have to get profitable, break even or go away,\" Calacanis says. \"The down market favours the small two-, three-, four-person company, not the huge company with 100 people losing half a million dollars a month. The big companies are going to have to sell off their assets. You'll see Yahoo probably sell 10 or 20 companies they bought, you'll see layoffs. It will be a flat market for years. But the internet will do good in terms of advertising, because when the market goes down, people want measurable advertising, and the internet is the most measurable, performance-based advertising. Newspapers, magazines, radio and television and outdoor advertising will suffer the most; and the internet will actually suffer the least. So it'll actually be good, long-term, for the internet.\"</p> <p>So who's likely to do well when times are hard? Calacanis replies: \"In general, it'll be companies that have a narrow focus, that focus on revenue and actually solve hard problems. The companies that won't do well will be the me-too companies: the fifth, sixth, seventh version of Twitter etc.\"</p> <p>And amid this carnage, how will Mahalo fare? \"We haven't shut anything down; we're under two years old. I'm pretty cheap and we raised a lot of money. We raised $20m before we launched and we don't spend that much money, so that gives us the ability to go for five years - if we never make any money.\"</p> <p>But won't people retreat from a niche - and new - product like Mahalo? \"I'm sure we'll do fine. We already have enough traffic, actually: we had 4.6m visitors in August, which is the slowest month of the year. That's enough traffic to cover about half of our burn rate, so based on that, if we double our traffic, we'll be able to break even. And if we cover half our burn rate, we can go for about eight or nine more years, so I'm pretty bullish.</p> <p>\"As we build out the product, the majority of people will use it. The Wikipedia, in the first five years, was a niche product that no one thought was that good, and then in the past three or four years, people think it's brilliant.</p> <p>\"What I've learned in my career is that it takes the same amount of effort to build a $10bn company as it does a $1bn company; you as the entrepreneur are going to put your entire life, your entire effort into it. So if you're going to put your entire life into it and have got some experience under your belt, why not swing for the fences, shoot for the moon? You have to have a big vision and take very small steps to get there. You have to be humble as you execute but visionary and gigantic in terms of your aspiration. In the internet industry it's not about grand innovation, it's about a lot of little innovations: every day, every week, every month, making something a little bit better.\"</p> <p>So will Calacanis spread his energies on to other projects if Mahalo doesn't grow as hoped for? \"This is the first time I've ever said this to anybody, this is an exclusive: this will be my last company. I'm not going to do another company after this. My hope and dream is to build the next Yahoo, the next Google, the next eBay; an internet company that lasts for all time. That's my goal and I think we're going to do it. And if we don't do it, the only person that would be at fault would be me, because we've set it up to have five years to figure out the problem and to execute it, so I only have myself to blame if this is not a huge success. And anything less than being the next Yahoo or Google or Microsoft or eBay or AOL would be a failure in my mind.\"</p> <p><strong>Silver lining</strong></p> <p>Can he offer any advice for budding entrepreneurs? \"These are dark days, but this is the time that value is built and the best companies are built in the down market, so there is really very little downside to becoming an entrepreneur; the risk is very minimal. If you're thinking about starting a company, you should take that plunge - it's actually a good time. Just control the costs, build something on the weekends, try to get some traction and take your time. Everybody else is going to be depressed and drinking and not working. So it's a great time to be an entrepreneur.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Saturday October 18 2008.

My dilemma is that it is a business, not a charity, and it sells the clothes in eastern Europe. I have heard that such schemes undercut local economies abroad, but this one seems to be </strong><strong>endorsed by lots of British schools and Bag2School's own website carries an Oxfam report on the issue of the </strong><strong>secondhand clothes trade. I volunteered to check all this out, but it is proving to be a minefield.</strong><br>Khadj Rouf, Oxon</p> <p>You are right to be wary. For some years, there have been reports of unscrupulous clothes collection schemes purporting to be charities when, in fact, they are rather shady outfits collecting your unwanted clothes to sell on for profit in other countries. However, Bag2School does not fall into that category and is, indeed, a very popular company used by many schools around the country to help raise funds. It has paid out more than \u00a34m to schools since 2001 and says that just 0.3% of its gross turnover in 2007 was profit. It is quite open about the fact that it is a for-profit company: \"A false impression has been given by too many activists that making a profit is irresponsible. In fact, making a profit, coupled with accountability, promotes both a strong economy and a motivated society.\" Having said all that, it doesn't go into much depth about what impact selling the clothes in eastern Europe has on the local economies.</p> <p>I relayed your dilemma to Oxfam and it said it had been planning to launch its own not-for-profit school collection scheme next year, but has now brought it forward. \"Schools interested in partnering with Oxfam should contact us,\" says its marketing manager. \"We will arrange a mutually agreed time for donations to be collected. Initially, we will match the Bag2School price of \u00a3200 a tonne and we will review this as the scheme progresses. Oxfam has an ethical trading policy that aims to ensure that we export clothes only to countries where the trade will have a net benefit or neutral effect.\" </p> <p>So now you have a choice, which boils down to whether you wish to use a well-known charity or a popular for-profit company.</p>",
  "<h2>Conservatives win but fail to get overall majority</h2> <p>The Canadian prime minister, Stephen Harper, said yesterday he will reach out to all parties during the global financial crisis after his Conservative party won national elections, but failed to clinch an overall parliamentary majority. Harper had called Tuesday's elections early, becoming the first major world leader to face voters since the financial crisis began. But though the party increased its majority, it fell 12 seats short of the 155 needed to govern on its own and will be forced to rely on opposition support to pass legislation - as it has since a 2006 election victory. <br><strong>Associated Press in Ottawa</strong></p> <h2>Ministers sign accord for formal ties with Lebanon</h2> <p>Syria and Lebanon signed a document yesterday formalising diplomatic ties for the first time in their turbulent history. They pledged to strengthen relations \"based on mutual respect for each country's sovereignty and independence\", according to the document. Embassies will be set up in Beirut and Damascus before January, said Syria's foreign minister, Walid al-Moallem, and his Lebanese counterpart, Fawzi Salloukh. The UN's special coordinator in Lebanon, Michael Williams, said it was a \"very important moment\" both for bilateral relations between the countries and for the region. <br><strong>Associated Press in Damascus</strong></p> <h2>Georgia-Russia meeting ends in acrimony</h2> <p>The first talks between Georgia and Russia since their war in August collapsed acrimoniously in Geneva last night, with each accusing the other of storming out. The Georgians said the Russians had pulled out of the meeting, brokered by the European Union and UN, to discuss the future of the Caucasus region. Moscow said Georgia scuppered the talks by refusing to meet officials from the breakaway republics of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. UN officials last night admitted the talks had been \"difficult\". Further negotiations will take place on November 18. <br><strong>Luke Harding in Moscow</strong></p>",
  "<p>These are feverish times in American politics, and wild conspiracy theories proliferate. Usually, they're about Barack Obama, and how he's not really called Barack Obama, wasn't born where he says he was born (\"Hawaii\", which is obviously made up), faked his own birth certificate, isn't a US citizen and, indeed, may not be running for president at all, raising the chilling possibility that the man calling himself \"Barack Obama\" and running for president is a plant who really is called Barack Obama, really was born in Hawaii and really is an American citizen. </p> <p>Even more brilliantly persuasive than any of these theories, though, is the sinister explanation being offered for the pathetic box-office performance of An American Carol, the \"conservative comedy\" released two weekends ago in the US. An American Carol had everything going for it: a director, David Zucker, whose credits include Scary Movie 3, Scary Movie 4, and Scary Movie 5; a cast comprising several notable Hollywood Republicans, including Kelsey Grammer and Dennis Hopper, and a killer premise: a portly, America-hating documentary-maker modelled on Michael Moore tries to ban the Fourth of July, with hilarious and patriotism-inducing consequences. </p> <p>Yet it was beaten at the box office by Beverly Hills Chihuahua, a movie about an annoying talking dog, even though lexicologists have long assumed that the phrase \"beaten at the box office by Beverly Hills Chihuahua\" belongs to the very small class of word-combinations that would never occur in the lifespan of the English language. So there can only be one explanation: a nationwide conspiracy by America's teenage multiplex employees to artificially depress the film's takings. \"We have heard from numerous people across the country that there has been some ticket fraud when buying a ticket for An American Carol,\" the moviemakers reported on their website, announcing the creation of a special fraud investigation unit. \"Please check your ticket. If you were in fact one of those people that were 'mistakenly' sold a ticket for another movie, please fill out the form below. Hold on to your ticket so we can have proof.\" The theory, eagerly amplified by numerous rightwing bloggers and news sites, goes like this: in a desperate bid to humiliate conservatives, cinema staff have been surreptitiously issuing tickets for other movies. Customers still get to see An American Carol, but the takings will go elsewhere and official attendance numbers will seem poor. </p> <p>Now, a logician might protest that there's another, simpler explanation for An American Carol having bombed: according to critics, it's \"painfully unfunny\", \"first and foremost a terrible piece of film-making\", \"idiotic, demeaning, and aggressively, persistently crummy\", and \"about as not-funny as a comedy can get\". But everyone knows that logic is biased towards Barack Obama. William of Ockham? Notorious liberal.</p> <p>\u2022 Consternation at Newsweek, which published a poll earlier this week revealing that 86% of Americans are dissatisfied with the direction in which the nation is going - a historic low, coupled with lower approval ratings for George Bush than Richard Nixon ever had to confront. A further 4% didn't know how they felt. So who on earth are the 10% who think everything's fine? \"The obvious guess is that the responders misunderstood the question,\" one reporter for the magazine speculated. \"So maybe a few old ladies thought the nice Newsweek pollster said, 'Are you sad it's tied?' And they said, 'Yes,' because they thought their guy had a big lead.\" Intrepidly, he headed for the streets of Washington DC to find some of these sunny optimists. In the course of much questioning, he found five, two of whom were pretty clearly relentless optimists - the kind of people temperamentally unable to feel depressed about anything, no matter how catastrophic the economic news. Another two were Canadian. The fifth was drunk.</p> <p>\u2022 Time now to turn - if only in the interests of redressing the balance - to Joe Biden who, despite being the clear favourite for vicepresident, can go for days without any significant coverage in the US at all. According to a profile in the current New Yorker, Biden's travelling press corps frequently consists of a single print-media reporter: studies reveal that he was the subject of between 2% and 6% of all news stories during the month of September, while Sarah Palin never fell below 15% and sometimes rose above 60%. Meanwhile, there is, as far as I can ascertain, one single professional Joe Biden lookalike in the whole of the United States, a man named Frank King who, the employment market being what it is at the moment, only makes ends meet by also offering his services as an impersonator of John McCain, Bill Clinton and John Edwards. He looks, in other words, like an adult male, which isn't surprising because he is one, although you've got to wonder whether that really works as a unique selling point.</p> <p>\u2022 This week Oliver watched, read and listened to wall-to-wall <strong>US election</strong> coverage until his ears bled and his eyes swam: \"I still can't work out the difference between a 'News Alert', a 'Breaking News Update' and a 'News Flash'.

  "<p>While the eyes of the western world have been fixed on the global financial crisis, the military campaign that launched the war on terror has been spinning out of control. Seven years after the US and Britain began their onslaught on Afghanistan to oust the Taliban and capture Osama bin Laden, the Taliban surround the capital, al-Qaida is flourishing in Pakistan and the war's sponsors have publicly fallen out about whether it has already been lost.</p> <p>As the US joint chiefs of staff chairman Admiral Mike Mullen concedes that the country is locked into a \"downward spiral\" of corruption, lawlessness and insurgency, Britain's ambassador in Kabul, Sir Sherard Cowper-Coles, is quoted in a leaked briefing as declaring that \"American strategy is destined to fail\". The same diplomat who told us last year that British forces would be in Afghanistan for decades now believes foreign troops are \"part of the problem, not the solution\". </p> <p>The British commander Brigadier Mark Carleton-Smith was last week even blunter. \"We're not going to win this war,\" he said, adding that if the Taliban were prepared to \"talk about a political settlement\", that was \"precisely the sort of progress that concludes insurgencies like this\". The double-barrelled duo were duly slapped down by US defence secretary Robert Gates for defeatism. But even Gates now publicly backs talks with the Taliban, which are in fact already taking place under Saudi sponsorship. </p> <p>This is the conflict western politicians and media continue to urge their reluctant populations to support as a war for civilisation. In reality, it is a war of barbarity, whose contempt for the value of Afghan life has fuelled the very resistance that western military and political leaders are now unable to contain.</p> <p>In this year alone, for every occupation soldier killed, at least three Afghan civilians have died at the hands of occupation forces. They include the 95 people, 60 of them children, killed by a US air assault in Azizabad in August; the 47 wedding guests dismembered by US bombardment in Nangarhar in July - US forces have a particular habit of attacking weddings; and the four women and children killed in a British rocket barrage six weeks ago in Sangin.</p> <p>By far the most comprehensive research into Afghan casualties over the past seven years has been carried out by Marc Herold, a US professor at the University of New Hampshire. In his latest findings, Herold estimates that the number of civilians directly killed by the US and other Nato forces since 2006, up to 3,273, is already higher than the toll exacted by the devastating three-month bombardment that ousted the Taliban regime in 2001. And over the past year civilian deaths at the hands of Nato forces have tripled, despite changes in rules of engagement.</p> <p>But most telling is the political and military calculation that underlies the Afghan civilian bloodletting. \"Close air support\" bomb attacks called in by ground forces - which rose from 176 in 2005 to 2,926 in 2007 and are now the US tactic of choice - are between four and 10 times as deadly for Afghan civilians as ground attacks, the figures show, and air strikes now account for 80% of those killed by the occupation forces. </p> <p>But while 242 US and Nato ground troops have died in the war with the Taliban this year, not a single pilot has been killed in action. The trade-off could not be clearer. With troops thin on the ground and the US military up to their necks in Iraq and elsewhere, US and Nato reliance on air attacks minimises their own casualties while guaranteeing that Afghan civilians will die in far larger numbers.</p> <p>It is that equation that makes a nonsense of US and British claims that their civilian victims are accidental \"collateral damage\", while the Taliban's use of roadside bombs, suicide attacks and classic guerrilla operations from civilian areas are a sign of their moral depravity. In real life, the escalating civilian death toll is not a mistake, but the result of a clear decision to put the lives of occupation troops before civilians; westerners before Afghans.</p> <p>Dependence on air power is also a reflection of US imperial overstretch and the reluctance of Nato states to put more boots on the ground. But however much the nominal Afghan president Hamid Karzai rails against Nato's recklessness with Afghan blood, the indiscriminate air war carries on regardless. Given that the US government spent 10 times more on every sea otter affected by the Exxon Valdez oil spill than it does in \"condolence payments\" to Afghans for the killing of a family member, perhaps that shouldn't come as a surprise.</p> <p>But nor should it be that the occupation's cruelty is a recruiting sergeant for the Taliban. As Aga Lalai, who lost both grandparents, his wife, father, three brothers and four sisters in a US bombing in Helmand last summer, put it: \"So long as there is just one 40-day-old boy remaining alive, Afghans will fight against the people who do this to us.\"</p> <p>That doesn't just go for Afghanistan. Gordon Brown recently told British troops in Helmand: \"What you are doing here prevents terrorism coming to the streets of Britain.\" The opposite is the case. The occupations of Afghanistan and Iraq - and the atrocities carried out against their people - are a crucial motivation for those planning terror attacks in Britain, as case after case has shown. Now the US is launching attacks inside Pakistan, the risks of further terror and destabilisation can only grow.</p> <p>Senior Pakistani officials are convinced Nato is preparing to throw in the towel in Afghanistan. Both Bush and the two US presidential candidates are committed to an Iraq-style surge, though the number of troops being talked about cannot possibly make a decisive difference to the conflict - and in Barack Obama's case may be as much about providing political cover for his plans for Iraq. But the strategic importance of Afghanistan doesn't suggest any early US withdrawal: more likely an attempt to co-opt sections of the Taliban as part of a messy and protracted attempt to rearrange the occupation.</p> <p>It will fail. The US and its allies cannot pacify Afghanistan nor seal the border with the Taliban's Pakistani sanctuary. Eventually there is bound to be some sort of negotiated withdrawal as part of a wider regional and domestic settlement. But many thousands of Afghans - as well as occupying troops - look certain to be sacrificed in the meantime.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:s.milne@theguardian.com\">s.milne@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p></p> <p>The quality of NHS care in England has improved by leaps and bounds over the past two years, the independent health watchdog says today.</p> <p>However, 60% of hospitals are still not dealing with superbug infections effectively, and 69% of GPs do not provide patients with the easy access to appointments that ministers want to see.</p> <p>The mixed picture emerged in the Healthcare Commission's annual performance ratings for 391 NHS organisations. It said 62% of trusts were providing a good or excellent quality of service, compared with 41% two years ago. Financial performance improved even more sharply, with 69% getting high grades, compared with 16% two years ago.</p> <p>Sir Ian Kennedy, the commission's chairman, said patients should celebrate the success of 42 trusts that received a \"double excellent\" rating, scoring top marks for both quality and finance. Last year there were 19, and just two in 2006.</p> <p>Foundation hospitals did particularly well on the scoring system, which measures performance against dozens of criteria including patient satisfaction and achievement of government targets.</p> <p>But serious weaknesses remain across much of the NHS. In the year to April a quarter of trusts failed to put in place adequate systems of infection control. Just over half did not achieve the government's target for reducing MRSA rates by 20% each year. Only 40% of trusts managed to introduce the right systems and hit the target.</p> <p>Kennedy said trusts risked losing the licence to treat patients if they did not achieve an adequate standard of hygiene before the end of March, when his inspectorate is due to be replaced by the Care Quality Commission. </p> <p>Spot checks over the past year found serious breaches of hygiene regulations at four hospitals and minor lapses at almost every trust visited. Inspectors will now begin a programme of spot checks of primary care, ambulance services and mental health trusts.</p> <p>Anna Walker, the commission's chief executive, said tackling MRSA and C difficile was not enough. Trusts should monitor other infections including norovirus, a vomiting disease that strikes in winter.</p> <p>She noted \"a dramatic decline\" in the number of primary care trusts meeting the target that every patient should be able to see a GP within two working days. This year 31% of practices met the target, compared with 80% last year.</p> <p>The change was due to a new sampling method that asked thousands of patients about their experiences of trying to get an appointment, instead of relying on information from GP practices.</p> <p>Dr Hamish Meldrum, chairman of the British Medical Association, said the report was misleading about GP waiting times. He said \"A recent survey showed almost nine out of 10 patients were satisfied that they were able to get an appointment within 48 hours.\"</p> <p>Gary Needle, the commission's head of assessment, said it could not be ruled out that GPs had been lying about how well they conformed to the target. </p> <p>The commission congratulated hospitals for cuts in waiting times for cancer patients and for making good progress towards treating all patients within 18 weeks of referral by a GP.</p> <p>Ambulances reached 77% of life threatening emergencies within eight minutes, exceeding the government's target of 75%. And mental health trusts helped thousands of patients by providing more crisis resolution teams in the community.</p> <p>Trusts in northern England got the highest grades across all services, while standards in London fell well below average.</p> <p>Alan Johnson, the health secretary, wrote to congratulate 57 high-performing trusts and told six \"double weak\" trusts to meet his officials to explain themselves.</p> <p>\u2022 Healthcare Commission video: <a href=\"http://212.100.249.179/AnnaWalker/index.html\">Anna Walker</a><br>\u2022 Healthcare Commission video: <a href=\"http://212.100.249.179/Rotherham/index.html \">Rotherham hospital</a> </p>",

David Murray, the Rangers chairman, added: \"Even as he battled with illness his football club was always his main priority.\"</p> <p>Thompson, who became the majority shareholder at Tannadice six years ago, was raised in Glasgow, but became a fervent United supporter after moving to Dundee in 1964. \"You can change your wife, your house, your car but you can never change your team,\" said Thompson recently. \"Chairmen come and go, boards come and go but the fans remain.

  "<p>The government is drawing up plans to give sweeping new powers to the security and intelligence agencies, and other public bodies, allowing them to access personal data using a wide range of internet sites, including social and gaming networks, Jacqui Smith, the home secretary, signalled yesterday.</p> <p>In a keynote speech on countering terrorism, she said the police and MI5 needed greater power to pursue suspected criminals and terrorists using new internet sites to conceal their communications. Though she stressed the importance of legal safeguards and public debate, there is little doubt the move will cause serious concern about the erosion of civil liberties and individual privacy.</p> <p>At present, security and intelligence agencies can demand to see telephone and email traffic from traditional communications services providers, CSPs, which store personal data for their own business reasons, notably for billing customers. However, the rapid expansion of new services offering game playing, social networking, auction and video sites, WiFi access, and broadband present a serious problem for the security services, according to Home Office officials.</p> <p>This is because new CSPs provided their services free, relying mainly on advertising for money, the officials say. As their services are free the companies do not hold records of their customers, many of whom use a number of pseudonyms and send messages from different electronic addresses.</p> <p>\"People have many accounts and sign up as Mickey Mouse and no one knows who they are\", a senior Whitehall security source said. He added: \"We have to do something.\" </p> <p>\"Criminal terrorists are exploiting free social networking sites,\" said another Whitehall security official. </p> <p>Communications systems were becoming \"increasingly complex and fragmented\", Smith said in her speech yesterday to the left-leaning Institute for Public Policy Research. New legislation would \"make it possible, one way or another, to collect it and store it\", she said, referring to personal data passing through internet sites. She said access to communications data - information about the identity and location of individuals - was a \"vital capability\" that had been used in 95% of serious crime cases and in nearly all MI5 operations since 2004. The alternative, she said, was a \"massive expansion of surveillance and other intrusive measures\".</p> <p>Anticipating a hostile response, Smith distinguished between the interception of communications - accessing the content of phone calls, messages, and emails which need a ministerial warrant - and access to \"communications data\", which identified the location and name of the caller but not the contents of their calls or messages. </p> <p>\"There are no plans for an enormous database which will contain the content of your emails, the texts that you send or the chats you have on the phone or online. Local authorities do not have the power to listen to your calls now and they never will in future.</p> <p>\"We have every right to be sceptical and questioning about a state activity which involves the collection of data ... and about the ways we already use it.\" She said she wanted to consult widely in the new year. A communications bill, due later this year, would now be postponed until well into next. </p> <p>Smith's intervention follows a serious dispute among senior Whitehall officials over a proposal that all communication data records would be held in a central database, a source said yesterday. A significant number of Home Office officials dealing with serious and organised crime believed this approach was impractical and disproportionate, he said.</p> <p>The Tories warned of the \"exponential increase in the powers of the state\" any new database could bring. Dominic Grieve, shadow home secretary, said: \"While we welcome the consultative approach, Jacqui Smith's speech begs mores questions than it answers.\" He added: \"These proposals would mark a substantial shift in the powers of the state to obtain personal information on individuals. Given the government's poor record on protecting data - and running databases - there needs to be a full and proper debate.\"</p> <p>Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Chris Huhne said: \"The government's Orwellian plans for a vast database of our private communications are deeply worrying. I hope that this consultation is not just a sham exercise to soft-soap an unsuspecting public,\" he said. </p> <p>Government officials insisted last night that a central database of communications data was just one option in proposals that would be put to consultations.</p>",
  "<p>After his box office smash Inside Man, Spike Lee figured he could exploit that brief window of Hollywood goodwill that exists for any director with a hit movie under his belt and get lift-off for one of two pet projects: a biopic of soul legend James Brown, and a drama about the LA riots. He figured wrong. \"I got an offer, but it was not enough,\" he says. \"I was very frustrated with Hollywood, so I said, 'Fuck it,' and went to Italy.\"</p> <p>Once there, he set plan B in motion: an adaptation of James McBride's 2002 bestseller Miracle at St Anna, the fictionalised account of four African-American soldiers from the all-black 92nd Infantry Division who find themselves trapped behind Nazi lines in Italy during the second world war. </p> <p>Targeting two Italian producers, Roberto Cicutto and Luigi Musini, who had distributed his films in Italy, Lee gave them three months to raise \u00a325m. \"I told them: 'We're going to start shooting in October.' This was July 2, and we didn't have a dime,\" says Lee, sporting his trademark tortoiseshell specs and one of the many Obama T-shirts he owns. \"They said, 'Spike, you're crazy', but I said, 'If we don't do this film now, it's never getting done.' We willed this film into being.\"</p> <p>At a moment when a black man is on the verge of being elected as the next US president, Miracle at St Anna is Lee's effort to set the record straight about the American men of all races who were part of the Allied victory. Due to screen at the London film festival today, it is the first film to portray the segregated 92nd - dubbed the Buffalo Soldiers - who fought in Italy at the tail end of the war.</p> <p>Lee doesn't flinch at drawing parallels with what's happening now. \"This whole thing is tied into Obama. These guys fought not knowing that there would be a black president, but they were hoping that some day America would deliver on its promise to life and liberty for all American citizens,\" he says. \"In the Constitution of the United States of America, it is written that slaves are three-fifths of a human being. That's why I'm happy to be alive today, because we're living in a time where there's a seismic shift happening. I never, ever thought that we'd get to a point where a man of African descent can be on the verge of being the president of the US.\"</p> <p>Lee's own mission is to upend the Hollywood myth-making apparatus that has mostly ignored the contributions of the one million African-Americans who served in the second world war. It's the reason he launched his bitter war of words with Clint Eastwood at this year's Cannes film festival, berating the film-maker over the paucity of black faces in his 2006 double bill, Flags of Our Fathers and Letters from Iwo Jima. It's also why Miracle opens with an old, embittered black veteran watching stone-faced as John Wayne parades through the 1962 drama The Longest Day on his television. </p> <p>\"It is not a mistake that this film begins with Wayne. This is the Hollywood bullshit mythology that excludes one million people,\" says Lee. \"You look at John Wayne - what did he represent? In the second world war films, John Wayne is kicking Nazi ass, and in the Pacific he's kicking Japanese ass. And if it's a western, he's killing the savage Indian. This film is a rebuttal to the same mythology that demeans other people. We have to change this shit. We cannot continue putting out these lies again and again. Young people growing up have no idea that this stuff even happened.\"</p> <p>Lee cites the 761st Tank Battalion, which came to Patton's rescue in the Battle of the Bulge, and the Tuskegee Airmen, whose story will soon be dramatised by George Lucas, as other neglected areas of black wartime participation. Responding to Lee's accusations that he'd effectively erased black GIs from history, Eastwood said in a Guardian interview in June that Lee should \"shut his face\", prompting Lee to reply that \"we're not on a plantation\". But the Brooklyn-based director, who has never been shy of taking a pop at fellow film-makers (with cynical timing, many feel, since he usually has a film to publicise), insists that the feud is now \"over, done with, squashed. I was never saying that it was just Eastwood himself. I was not putting the bull's-eye on him and saying he's the reason for this omission.\" Did he feel the need to apologise to Eastwood personally? \"No, there was no need to say anything. It's done.\"</p> <p>How it was done, it turns out, is that Lee bumped into Steven Spielberg at a basketball game and asked him to extend the olive branch to Eastwood on his behalf. It is likely to have come at Disney's behest, with the studio, which is distributing Miracle in the US, worried that an unresolved spat with a beloved industry figure such as Eastwood would fatally damage any Oscar hopes the film might have - although Lee insists he hasn't had any conversations with Disney. \"That's not a discussion we've had. I'm more concerned with having some numbers when this film opens.\"</p> <p>As for the film itself - bar an abrasive redneck caricature who sends the Buffalo Soldiers into a suicidal frontline attack at the Serchio river - this isn't so much about the politics of African-Americans fighting for the US military, or even a black Saving Private Ryan, as a magic-realist tale of four African-American soldiers who seek refuge in an Italian village.</p> <p>The film's philosophical divide is represented by duelling sergeants Aubrey Stamps (Derek Luke), the educated, idealistic one who believes that fighting for their country is the road to change, and Bishop Cummings (Michael Ealy), a streetwise cynic who thinks it perpetuates their status as second-class citizens. To underline this divide, McBride and Lee concocted a flashback scene in which the soldiers, still at boot camp in the deep south, are refused service at an ice-cream parlour, while German PoWs feast on sundaes. McBride extracted the scene from reality, though he added the PoWs. Lee, however, insists that their research turned up plenty of evidence of German PoWs getting \"better housing, better food, better everything\", often on the same bases as the black GIs. \"You're a young black man being trained to kill Nazis, and you look around and see the people you're being trained to kill are getting better treatment!\"</p> <p>Compared to his outstanding (and underrated) Malcolm X, Miracle is a disappointment. There's plenty to admire, but there's a lot of muddle, too, with meandering subplots, jarring tonal shifts (hardboiled noir in the framing sequences; an awkward John Leguizamo cameo) and unlikely sequences (a brash, loud village dance when there are Nazis crawling all around?) that could have been sliced from the hefty running time.</p> <p>Lee filters his vision through what purports to be the bygone spirit of Italian neorealism, claiming a direct lineage from classics such as Vittorio de Sica's Bicycle Thieves through the film's little orphaned Angelo (Matteo Sciabordi), who strikes up a friendship with gentle giant Train (Omar Benson Miller). He's the film's sentimental and quasi-mystical mascot, and, fortunately for Lee, he found in Sciabordi a child the camera adores.</p> <p>\"The one wild card in this was the kid,\" says Lee. \"I spent many a sleepless night worrying that if we don't get the right kid, it's not going to work. We had an open audition in Florence, and we were blessed with Matteo. He never acted before, but he had the qualities - the sensitivity, the intelligence, the face, the innocence that you need for a child to play this role. You might think I'm bragging, but he's as good as the kid in Bicycle Thieves. He saved us.\"</p> <p>The film's most devastating sequence is the reenactment of the August 1944 massacre that took place in Sant'Anna di Stazzema, where SS officers mowed down 560 innocent civilians, mostly women, children and the elderly, in the town square. Lee returned to the actual Tuscan location to recreate the scene. \"We shot there for two days, and everyone on the cast and crew could feel the spirits and souls of those who were slaughtered,\" he says. \"That can't help but inspire you and push you, that you have a duty to try to get this right.\"</p> <p>But some Italians are sure that Lee didn't get it right. Earlier this month, the director travelled to Florence for the film's Italian premiere and to receive an honorary citizenship award from Sant'Anna, only to face charges that Miracle insulted the Italian resistance fighters. Veterans from the National Association of Italian Partisans blasted the film as \"full of lies\" and \"an insult to the memory of the brave fighters who gave their lives\", primarily for fictional scenes that depict anti-fascist partisans indirectly sparking the atrocity by hiding in the village and abandoning the villagers to their fate; this contradicts the historical account of the massacre as an unprovoked war crime.</p> <p>\"I am not apologising for anything,\" the director told the Italian press, adding that there was \"a lot about your history you have yet to come to grips with\". The film has received the same mixed reviews there as elsewhere, with Corriere della Sera taking Lee to task for making a \"phoney and rhetorical\" war film. Back in the US, Lee - and Disney - hoped Miracle would surf a euphoric wave of Obama-mania and the tectonic changes happening in America's political landscape. But after the film barely scraped $7m in its first 10 days, their expectations have - like those of Republican politicians - been dramatically downsized. </p> <p>If Obama's surge hasn't helped Miracle's US campaign, Lee is still confident America will vote its first African-American president into office. \"I think there's going to be a large, large turnout of young Americans - more white than black - who have been part of the energy, the vitality and excitement of the Obama campaign.

  "<p>Guy Ritchie and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/madonna\">Madonna</a> ended months of speculation yesterday by confirming that their eight-year marriage had come to an end. Leading lawyers predicted Ritchie would gain far less than half of the singer's estimated \u00a3300m fortune.</p> <p>News of the couple's divorce was greeted with little surprise yesterday. Rather like the implosion of the Icelandic financial system, it was something that those who keep an eye on such things had seen coming for some time. </p> <p>The only shock seemed to be that the marriage had lasted so long. When Madonna first stepped out with Ritchie in 1998 there was much discussion of how a relationship between pop's biggest control freak and a little-known British film director 10 years her junior could last. And even after the pair had their son, Rocco, and got married, there were perennial whispers that all was not well in any of their many houses.</p> <p>In June it was reported the singer had consulted Paul McCartney's divorce lawyer, Fiona Shackleton. But just weeks ago the couple made a public show of affection at the premiere of Ritchie's film, RocknRolla, in Leicester Square in London. </p> <p>Madonna's spokeswoman, Liz Rosenberg, said the couple expected to agree a divorce settlement without going through the courts. Ritchie, a mildly successful film director with far less earning power than his wife, is expected to walk out of the marriage with a fraction of her fortune.</p> <p>\"It is absolute nonsense to suggest that Guy Ritchie could get half of Madonna's wealth,\" said Andrew Newbury, a partner in family law at Pannone. \"Around 90% of couples never get as far as a court hearing, but if Madonna and Guy Ritchie do, the court will look at what each was worth when they married, and at the wealth they have built up during their marriage, which is what will be taken into account.\"</p> <p>Margaret Hatwood, a collaborative family lawyer from Thomas Eggar, added: \"One of the significant things here is that a lot of Madonna's wealth was built up before the marriage. I don't think Guy Ritchie will benefit greatly from that.\"</p> <p>Both lawyers agreed that the settlement won by Heather Mills McCartney earlier this year after her divorce from Paul McCartney was likely to be significant. The \u00a324.3m she was awarded was a tiny slice of his estimated \u00a3825m fortune.</p> <p>\"In some cases, one party can claim a sort of career prejudice,\" said Hatwood, citing the example of Julia McFarlane, who gave up a high-flying legal job to become a stay-at-home mother and was awarded alimony of \u00a3250,000 a year in 2006 for the rest of her life in recognition of her contribution to her husband's career. \"But arguably Guy Ritchie's career has been enhanced by his marriage to Madonna, rather like Heather Mills McCartney benefited from being married to a Beatle.\"</p> <p>Barrister Joanna Grandfield, from law firm Mills &amp; Reeve, added that if the couple had signed a prenuptial agreement it could count in any court case. \"A premarital agreement, properly constituted, is likely to be given much weight in the English courts and could have a great bearing as to how assets should be shared,\" she said.</p> <p>Ritchie, 40, and Madonna, 50, married almost eight years ago in Scotland. But yesterday the Sun reported that a recent escalation in rows had led to Madonna and Ritchie communicating via their personal assistants. It claimed Madonna had wanted to wait until the end of her Sticky and Sweet global tour before announcing the split. But the date has been brought forward with both parties wanting a divorce finalised before Christmas. </p> <p>Ritchie has broken off from filming in France to fly back to the UK to inform his parents of the split, the paper added. </p> <p>Madonna and Ritchie have two sons, Rocco, eight, and David Banda, a Malawian boy they adopted in 2006. Madonna also has a daughter, Lourdes, 12, fathered by personal trainer Carlos Leon.</p> <h2>Road to Ritchies</h2> <p><strong>Mar 1998</strong> Madonna meets British film director Guy Ritchie at a dinner party hosted by Sting </p> <p><strong>Aug 2000</strong> Madonna gives birth in the US to their first child, Rocco, after an emergency caesarean section.

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/madonna\">Madonna</a> has elevated many unlikely items into cultural signifiers: conical bras, yoga teachers and Kabbalah centres, to take a brief and Proustian tour through the singer's career. But few would have predicted that British director Guy Ritchie would join that eclectic roll call. This coupling was, for a moment, as exciting as it was unexpected. A cult(ish) British director and an American superstar? To a country so fond of self-deprecation, and for so long in the grumbling, intimidated shadow of its bigger and brasher transatlantic neighbour, it was as though the hometown boy had pulled the prom queen. </p> <p>If there's one movie this couple should have made, it was Richard Curtis' Notting Hill. Their wedding in a castle in Scotland, attended by George Clooney, Brad Pitt and Donatella Versace, was like a fairytale for all involved: her, him and the British magazine reading public. </p> <p>It started, as most things by Madonna once did, a trend, with various A-list Americans descending on the capital. </p> <p>Suddenly, thanks to this recently unknown director, strange species such as Gwyneth Paltrow were stalking the land, getting off with unlikely British men and making foreign noises about \"packed macrobiotic lunches\" and \"in-house Pilates machines\".</p> <p>Yet national doubt soon set in and instead of this partnership elevating the couple in the public's eyes, it diminished them both. </p> <p>While British audiences have long found the appeal of Ritchie and his dubious east London accent mystifying, it perhaps explained what brought him and Madonna together: here were two people rivalled only by each other in their capacity for brass-necked make-overs. For Madonna, this constituted swapping a persona based on Pope-baiting provocation with that of spiritually aware exercise obsessive; for Ritchie, it meant jettisoning his childhood as stepson of a baronet in favour of a blizzard of dropped aitches. </p> <p>Madonna's adoption of a lady-of-the-manor look when she and Ritchie first married was as cartoonish as her husband's take on Britain, with his East End gangster movies and weekend shooting trips in plus fours. How could it fail? Two characters from Dick van Dyke's Guide to Britain - perfect!</p> <p>Logical, perhaps, but the marriage made this once infallible pop culture icon suddenly seem, well, a little silly in British eyes. Could she really not see how clumsy his mockney poses were? How one note his movies are? She became styled by the media as the gullible, image-chasing harridan. He was the henpecked husband. These were images that no amount of adoptions, children or film collaborations could shake off. </p> <p>It's easy to mock Ritchie now and his \"Alright guv, I'm on t' dog and bone\" film genre, but when he and Madonna met he was - and this is an actual quote - \"the British Quentin Tarantino\". </p> <p>He would bring her cinematic credibility, the one thing that has always eluded her, and she would bring him international fame. Well, one of them was right, if perhaps not in the way he imagined. Ritchie, sweetly, forgot that cinematic maxim: never make a movie with Madonna, especially if you're involved with her. It took Sean Penn years and an acrimonious divorce to get past Shanghai Surprise. Rupert Everett's friendship with her, and nearly his career, failed to live through The Next Best Thing. But Swept Away was a new low in husband/wife film collaborations and, if only to avoid a repeat of that, it's hard not to see this divorce as the best possible outcome for both.</p> <p>The divorce has been predicted since pretty much the week they returned from their honeymoon. Already celebrity columnists were opining yesterday that marriage to Madonna is \"very tricky\" (this was then followed by one particular columnist's admission \"I never met her\".) </p> <p>It seems unlikely that intimidation of his wife's success was what did it for Ritchie in the end, seeing as that was hardly a surprise she sprung on him after the ceremony. More likely, it is just another instructive tale that when a couple is brought together by celebrity then ultimately it is celebrity that will bring them down. Maybe he thought there was more to her behind her image, maybe she thought there was less behind his. It's a tragedy for their children and an end of an era for London. And for the Pilates machine manufacturers of Great Britain.</p>",
  "<p>US troops will withdraw from Iraq by December 31 2011 and American and British soldiers deployed there in the interim period could face prosecution in Iraq's courts for serious, premeditated \"off-duty\" crimes under the terms of a draft status of forces agreement outlined yesterday by officials in Baghdad and Washington.</p> <p>The draft agreement, which is intended to replace the UN security council mandate that legitimised the US-led invasion in March 2003, and subsequent occupation, follows months of fraught negotiations. It must be ratified by the Iraqi parliament before the end of the year.</p> <p>Passage is far from guaranteed. Iraq's most influential Shia cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani, said last week that any pact must have the support of Iraq's people and political parties before it could be endorsed. Some of the deal's terms may also prove controversial in the US.</p> <p>But the agreement, if implemented, would mark a milestone in the slow, often painful evolution of independent, Iraqi self-government since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein five years ago. It also represents a climbdown by the Bush administration, which had previously refused to set a deadline or timetable for a troop withdrawal.</p> <p>Ali al-Dabbagh, the Iraqi government spokesman, said US forces would pull out of Iraqi towns and villages by the middle of next year and withdraw from the country as a whole by the end of 2011. But he left open the possibility that some US and other forces might be asked to stay beyond that date if needed.</p> <p>\"The withdrawal is to be achieved in three years,\" Dabbagh said. \"In 2011 the government at that time will determine whether it needs a new pact or not. What type of pact will depend on the challenges it faces.\" Dabbagh indicated US troops and Pentagon contractors would be subject to US law while on base or while conducting off-base \"military missions\" - a potentially catch-all definition since US forces rarely venture off base.</p> <p>But he added that \"Iraqi judicial law will be implemented in case these forces commit a serious and deliberate felony outside their military bases and when off-duty\". In such instances, American offenders would be held in US custody but could be surrendered to the Iraqi authorities for questioning and possible trial.</p> <p>A series of incidents allegedly involving US forces and Pentagon employees which led to the death of Iraqi civilians and, in one case, the alleged rape of a 14-year-old girl, has outraged public opinion and added to pressure for tougher rules.</p> <p>Officials in Washington confirmed yesterday that a compromise on prosecutions and a withdrawal date had been reached but urged caution. \"There is a text that people are looking at,\" a state department spokesman said. \"Nothing is done until everything is done. Everything isn't done.\" </p> <p>The draft agreement, if implemented, would also prevent the US military from continuing to hold Iraqi suspects without charging them with crimes under Iraqi law. At present the majority of the 18,000 people held by coalition forces have not been charged with any offence.</p> <p>British soldiers serving in Iraq are likely to be subject to the new rules from next year. Asked this week about the future status of British forces, the Ministry of Defence said: \"Our requirements are very similar to those of the US. We intend to use the Iraqi/US text as the basis of our agreement.\"</p> <p>The mooted deal comes against a backdrop of growing pressure from Iraqi public opinion and from Iraq's powerful majority Shia neighbour, Iran, for the departure of US and other foreign forces. Iraq's nationalist prime minister, Nouri al-Maliki, has moved successfully in recent months to assert army and police control over areas such as Basra, although levels of violence have been rising again in recent weeks.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Over the past couple of years, I have been lucky enough to make a really good friend of a work colleague. We see each other socially, our partners have become friends, and sharing confidences and hopes for the future has made us emotionally close.</strong></p> <p><strong>Recently she received a promotion that has made her my boss. I knew this was going to be strange, but it has upset me far more than I foresaw. Following the principle that, while you cannot always control events, you can control your reaction to them, I have tried to focus on the positive aspects of the change: I am pleased for her success and it is good that there is still someone at work who knows and likes me. However, I have not been able to shake off the distress at the alteration in a relationship that I cherished, and a sense of betrayal that she put her career above our friendship.</strong></p> <p><strong>I now avoid seeing her outside work and I know I have become sulky and withdrawn in her presence. Even looking at her makes me feel angry, and I am surprised by my childish reaction. I have started applying for other jobs, but it just adds to my anger that I feel compelled to leave my job because of someone else's actions.</strong></p> <p><strong>I am struggling to understand why I can't adapt to this change and why it is causing me so much stress. How can I reclaim my friendship and my peace of mind?</strong></p> <h2>Accept the way things are </h2> <p>Close friendships between women are really important, but the pain of their loss is often not recognised. You opened up to this colleague and relied on her for a time - but you are right to conclude that she isn't available to you in the same way any more. She can't be. As your manager, she has to set certain boundaries at work in order to do her job professionally. </p> <p>If you find yourself feeling unhappy and sulky, is that because you can't confide your feelings to anyone else? Talk to another friend and get some support there, if you can. <br><strong>RV, London</strong></p> <h2>See it as an opportunity</h2> <p>A friend of mine applied for a job at the company I worked for, was hired, and eventually promoted to a position above me. My bitterness was compounded by the fact that we had equal qualifications and experience, and that I had voiced my concerns about the potential problems when the job was advertised. </p> <p>Like you, despite my best attempts to \"rise above it\", I became sulky and withdrawn as a result of what I saw as an unfair outcome, although I had not applied for the job concerned. In the end, I found another job and it was the best thing I could have done in terms of salvaging our friendship. Rather than being angry about the situation, try to see it as an opportunity to renew your relationship with your friend and to make some serious decisions about your own future. <br><strong>KZ, Leeds</strong></p> <h2>She may also be upset</h2> <p>I have developed a mantra, and try my best to live by it: never, under any circumstances, allow work to impinge on your health, family life or personal friendships. </p> <p>For you, this may mean looking for another position elsewhere, but only as a last resort. Take an interim step and talk to your new boss, and try to find a solution that allows you to stay where you are, at least for a while. Remember that being a manager can be a lonely existence and she will have almost certainly noticed how differently you are behaving towards her. She may even be quite hurt.<br><strong>SH, via email</strong></p> <h2>Get your feelings out in the open</h2> <p>The situation is causing you stress because you are seeing it in far too emotional terms. You think that by prioritising her career and applying for this promotion, she has betrayed your friendship. But should she really have put her career on hold because of you? Would you have been willing to do this for her? </p> <p>Opportunities for promotion come along fairly infrequently - your friend probably just assumed you were both mature enough to deal with the new relationship at work if she was successful in her application. </p> <p>If she is to be a fair and effective boss to everyone, your friendship inevitably has to change. Talk to her outside of work, and explain how the change in circumstances has made you feel. Sulking will do neither of you any good, and you need to get your feelings in the open so you can get past this. <br><strong>EJ, Edinburgh</strong></p> <h2>This is not about your friendship</h2> <p>Did you apply for the same job? It doesn't sound like it. Has she treated you differently since her promotion? Did you actually want her new role, but didn't apply for it, and now feel jealous of a friend who took control of her life and succeeded?</p> <p>Your belief that she \"put her career above your friendship\" shows a rather selfish and simplistic view - one I am sure your friend would reject if given the opportunity. This promotion is about her and her career and not about any friendship. How must your friend feel? Starting a new job is stressful and she needs support. It must seem odd to her that you have suddenly started to blank her.</p> <p>Why not use this as an opportunity to reassess your priorities: irrespective of your friend's situation, is it time to move on from your job? Why not ask your friend for advice - she obviously knows how to progress in her career and will have an insight into your strengths too.<br><strong>LA, via email</strong></p> <h2>What the expert thinks: Linda Blair</h2> <p>When you say that you're surprised by your \"childish reaction\" to your friend's promotion, you've touched on the key to your dilemma. Your reaction is indeed inappropriate - and that, I suspect, is because you're not reacting to what's happening right now but to some unresolved conflict in your past. </p> <p>To help you identify what that might be, let's strip the current situation of its particulars, and see if what's left triggers any memories. One of your contemporaries, a friend or relative with whom you've shared confidences, hopes and dreams, has suddenly become more powerful - and in particular, more favoured - than you. It feels like she has left you behind, and that she now enjoys advantages that you wish you had. Worst of all, she got into that position without involving you or letting you know her intentions.</p> <p>Does that seem familiar at all? Did you feel your parents preferred one of your siblings to you? Did a teacher you longed to please choose to bestow her praise on a friend of yours, while at the same time ignoring you? If my suggestions allow you access to the original distress behind this I hope you can now understand why your reaction to your friend's promotion seems surprising. You're reacting to this original event.</p> <p>However, understanding by itself rarely sorts out a problem. If you've discovered a dormant but troubling event in your past, you may wish to work through your feelings so you can let go of them. An analytic or cognitive analytic therapist could help you do so - ask your GP to recommend someone.</p> <p>It may be, though, that my suggestions don't trigger any particular memories. If so, you must accept that your initial reaction was unwarranted, and that - as happens to all of us from time to time - you may never know exactly why you felt so strongly. However, you're now reinforcing your initial reaction repeatedly, and it isn't making you feel any better. Nor will you solve the problem if you leave your job for another one just now - in fact, that would only make you more liable to run from uncomfortable situations in the future. If you wish to retain your friendship and bolster your self-esteem, you need to talk to your friend.</p> <p>She has undoubtedly noticed your coolness towards her, and she probably doesn't know why you're behaving in this manner. If she thinks well of you, she's unlikely to have concluded that you're jealous of what was quite likely a sensible move on her part. Why not invite her to meet for a coffee outside working hours? Explain that the consequences of her promotion took you by surprise, and that you haven't known quite how to relate to her since. Add that you feel you need to decide together how to handle your friendship.</p> <p>In truth, you friend should have proposed such a meeting some time ago, so your mature appeal should go a long way towards restoring a balance between the two of you - and hopefully, your honesty and your direct approach will reignite your friendship.</p> <h2>Next week: My partner is seeing two other women</h2> <p>My partner and I have been together for 15 years. About six years ago, he started a relationship with another woman, which I felt jealous about, but I decided that I loved him too much to leave him. He says he loves both of us equally.</p> <p>Recently, he told me that he is polyamorous and is now in a relationship with a third woman. He says he needs his space, and that he doesn't want to share his other lives with me. He is very caring towards me, except when it comes to discussing this issue. We enjoy each other's company, but I constantly feel the presence of a third or fourth person.</p> <p>I can't stand the constant dishonesty that he indulges in to accommodate these other two women - he says he needs to deceive me as he believes he will hurt me if I find out about the specifics of his other relationships. We constantly fight about this and have had a very unhappy past few years. I feel I have a right to know about his life, especially because, by his own admission, the main thing he discusses with the other women is how our relationship is going downhill. </p> <p>I feel as if my privacy is not being respected, and I am expected to just learn to live with the fact that he has relationships with other women. How do I decide whether I am ready to accept that he is \"different\" or whether I am too jealous to ever be happy in this situation?</p> <p>\u2022 Private Lives appears every Thursday.

  "<p><br>How do you get the nerve, I ask Aravind Adiga, to write a novel about the experiences of the Indian poor? After all, you're an enviably bright young thing, a middle-class, Madras-born, Oxford-educated ex-Time magazine correspondent? How would you understand what your central character, the downtrodden, uneducated son of a rickshaw puller turned amoral entrepreneur and killer, is going through?</p> <p>It's the morning after Adiga, 33, won the \u00a350,000 Man Booker award with his debut novel The White Tiger, which reportedly blew the socks off Michael Portillo, the chair of judges, and, more importantly, is already causing offence in Adiga's homeland for its defiantly unglamorous portrait of India's economic miracle. For a western reader, too, Adiga's novel is bracing: there is an unremitting realism usually airbrushed from Indian films and novels. It makes Salman Rushdie's Booker-winning chronicle of post-Raj India, Midnight's Children (a book that Adiga recognises as a powerful influence on his work), seem positively twee. The Indian tourist board must be livid.</p> <p>Adiga, sipping tea in a central London boardroom, is upset by my question. Or as affronted as a man who has been exhausted by the demands of the unexpected win and the subsequent media hoopla can be. Guarded about his private life, he looks at me with tired eyes and says: \"I don't think a novelist should just write about his own experiences. Yes, I am the son of a doctor, yes, I had a rigorous formal education, but for me the challenge of a novelist is to write about people who aren't anything like me.\" On a shortlist that included several books written by people very much like their central characters (Philip Hensher, for example, writing about South Yorkshire suburbanites during the miners' strike, or Linda Grant writing about a London writer exploring her Jewish heritage), the desire not to navel-gaze is surprising, even refreshing. </p> <p>But isn't there a problem: Adiga might come across as a literary tourist ventriloquising others' suffering and stealing their miserable stories to fulfil his literary ambitions? \"Well, this is the reality for a lot of Indian people and it's important that it gets written about, rather than just hearing about the 5% of people in my country who are doing well. In somewhere like Bihar there will be no doctors in the hospital. In northern India politics is so corrupt that it makes a mockery of democracy. This is a country where the poor fear tuberculosis, which kills 1,000 Indians a day, but people like me - middle-class people with access to health services that are probably better than England's - don't fear it at all. It's an unglamorous disease, like so much of the things that the poor of India endure.</p> <p>\"At a time when India is going through great changes and, with China, is likely to inherit the world from the west, it is important that writers like me try to highlight the brutal injustices of society. That's what writers like Flaubert, Balzac and Dickens did in the 19th century and, as a result, England and France are better societies. That's what I'm trying to do - it's not an attack on the country, it's about the greater process of self-examination.\"</p> <p>That, though, makes Adiga's novel sound like funless didacticism. Thankfully - for all its failings (comparisons with the accomplished sentences of Sebastian Barry's shortlisted The Secret Scripture could only be unfavourable) - The White Tiger is nothing like that. Instead, it has an engaging, gobby, megalomaniac, boss-killer of a narrator who reflects on his extraordinary rise from village teashop waiter to success as an entrepreneur in the alienated, post-industrial, call-centre hub of Bangalore. </p> <p>Balram Halwai narrates his story through letters he writes, but doesn't send, to the Chinese premier, Wen Jiabao. Wen is poised to visit India to learn why it is so good at producing entrepreneurs, so Balram presumes to tell him how to win power and influence people in the modern India. Balram's story, though, is a tale of bribery, corruption, skulduggery, toxic traffic jams, theft and murder. Whether communist China can import this business model is questionable. In any event, Balram tells his reader that the yellow and the brown men will take over the world from the white man, who has become (and this is where Balram's analysis gets shaky) effete through toleration of homosexuality, too slim and physically weakened by overexposure to mobile phones.</p> <p>Halwai has come from what Adiga calls the Darkness - the heart of rural India - and manages to escape his family and poverty by becoming chauffeur to a landlord from his village, who goes to Delhi to bribe government officials. Why did he make Halwai a chauffeur? \"Because of the whole active-passive thing. The chauffeur is the servant but he is, at least while he's driving, in charge, so the whole relationship is subverted.\" Disappointingly, Adiga only knows of the Hegelian master-slave dialectic from reading Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morals. But that dialectic is the spine of his novel: the servant kills his master to achieve his freedom. </p> <p>The White Tiger teems with indignities masquerading as employee duties. Such, Adiga maintains, is India - even as Delhi rises like a more eastern Dubai, call-centres suck young people from villages and India experiences the pangs of urbanisation that racked the west two centuries ago. \"Friends who came to India would always say to me it was a surprise that there was so little crime and that made me wonder why.\" Balram supplies an answer: servitude. \"A handful of men in this country have trained the remaining 99.9% - as strong, as talented, as intelligent in every way - to exist in perpetual servitude.\" What Balram calls the trustworthiness of servants is the basis of the entire Indian economy; unlike China, he reflects, India doesn't need a dictatorship or secret police to keep its people grimly achieving economic goals.</p> <p>\"If we were in India now, there would be servants standing in the corners of this room and I wouldn't notice them,\" says Adiga. \"That is what my society is like, that is what the divide is like.\" Adiga conceived the novel when he was travelling in India and writing for Time magazine. \"I spent a lot of time hanging around stations and talking to rickshaw pullers.\" What struck him was the physical difference between the poor and the rich: \"In India, it's the rich who have problems with obesity. And the poor are darker-skinned because they work outside and often work without their tops on so you can see their ribs. But also their intelligence impressed me. What rickshaw pullers, especially, reminded me of was black Americans, in the sense that they are witty, acerbic, verbally skilled and utterly without illusions about their rulers.\"</p> <p>It is not surprising then that the greatest literary influences on the book were three great African-American 20th-century novelists - Ralph Ellison, James Baldwin and Richard Wright. \"They all wrote about race and class, while later black writers focus on just class. Ellison's Invisible Man was extremely important to me. That book was disliked by white and blacks. My book too will cause widespread offence. Balram is my invisible man, made visible. This white tiger will break out of his cage.\"</p> <p>For Indian readers, one of the most upsetting parts of that break-out is that Halwai casts off his family. \"This is a shameful and dislocating thing for an Indian to do,\" says Adiga. \"In India, there has never been strong central political control, which is probably why the family is still so important. If you're rude to your mother in India, it's a crime as bad as stealing would be here. But the family ties get broken or at least stretched when anonymous, un-Indian cities like Bangalore draw people from the villages. These really are the new tensions of India, but Indians don't think about them. The middle- classes, especially, think of themselves still as victims of colonial rule. But there is no point any more in someone like me thinking of myself as a victim of you [Adiga has cast me, not for the first time, as a colonial oppressor]. India and China are too powerful to be controlled by the west any more.</p> <p>\"We've got to get beyond that as Indians and take responsibility for what is holding us back.\" What is holding India back? \"The corruption, lack of health services for the poor and the presumption that the family is always the repository of good.\"</p> <p>Our time is nearly over. Adiga doesn't know how he will spend his prize money, isn't even sure if there's a safe bank in which to deposit it. Doesn't he fear attacks at home for his portrayal of India? After all, the greatest living Indian painter, MF Husain, lives in exile. \"I'm in a different position from Husain. Fortunately, the political class doesn't read. He lives in exile because his messages got through, but mine probably won't.\"</p> <p>Adiga, who says he has written his second novel but won't talk about it (\"It might be complete crap, so there's no point\"), flies home to Mumbai today to resume his bachelor life. His most pressing problem is that Mumbai landlords don't let flats to single men. Why? \"They think we're more likely to be terrorists. I'd just like to say, through your pages, that I am not.

  "<p>The two-day bounce inspired by globally coordinated efforts to bail out banks came to a grinding halt yesterday.

  "<h2>Mac G5 forever?</h2> <p>I have a 1.6 GHz PowerMac G5 running Mac OS X 10.3.9 (Panther). Earlier this year, the Safari browser was not supported as 10.3.9 is \"old\". I have recently bought 2GB of RAM, so the total is now 2.25GB, but this has done nothing to improve the operation or speed, as I thought it would. If I bought Leopard, would that improve things? I hope to keep my Mac for a few more years.<br><strong>Peter Medhurst </strong> </p> <p><strong>JS:</strong> The PowerMac G5 was an advanced and relatively powerful 64-bit tower system when it was unveiled in August 2003 at \u00a31,549, but it is coming towards the end of its life. Apple has stopped supporting \"Mac Classic\" (OS 9) and will stop supporting machines with PowerPC chips, like yours, having moved to Intel. Upgrading to Leopard would provide some useful extra features, and should help prolong its useful life. Leopard has had five upgrades in less than a year - it's already up to 10.5.5 - so most early problems should have been fixed. However, I'm very surprised that adding 2GB of memory did not give a noticeable performance boost (did you check the RAM was recognised?), and I would expect to see performance reduced with Leopard. One solution would be to partition your hard drive and have a different operating system (Panther and Leopard) on each partition. You could do this with software such as iPartition or DriveGenius.</p> <p>You can, of course, continue to use Mac OS X 10.3 (Panther) until the hardware breaks down, as long as your existing applications continue to do what you need. However, you may not be able to get some new functions that you would like.</p> <h2>Me halted</h2> <p>I have a Sony Vaio PCG-FX101 running Windows Me. It will not boot in any of the startup options, and I get \"Windows protection error. System halted\". I want to transfer my files and documents to a new laptop.<br><strong>Adam Bell</strong> </p> <p><strong>JS:</strong> You should be able to transfer all your files from backup CDs. The main options are to get the Vaio going again, or to remove the hard drive and access it from another PC. Unfortunately, \"System halted\" is one of the more useless Windows error messages, and gives us no idea what's wrong. It could be one of a dozen problems including a bad driver, a corrupted registry, failing memory or a motherboard problem. Microsoft has a support document, How to Troubleshoot Windows Protection Error Messages (<a href=\"http://bit.ly/aj0046\">bit.ly/aj0046</a>).</p> <p>Usually you can start a Windows Me machine from a DOS floppy disk, but the FX101 doesn't have a floppy drive. However, you could set the Bios to boot from CD and try to run a Live CD of Linux. The Knoppix version (<a href=\"http://bit.ly/aj0047\">bit.ly/aj0047</a>) has been a popular choice for rescuing files from Windows PCs. Since you want to transfer the files to another PC, it's probably simpler to remove the hard drive from the Sony, install it in an external hard drive enclosure and plug it in to your new machine via a USB port. You probably need a case for a 10GB 2.5in IDE hard drive (<a href=\"http://bit.ly/aj0048\">bit.ly/aj0048</a>), but check first. Finally, you could try blowing the dust out of the Sony, making sure all the chips and cables are fully seated and putting the hard drive back: it could work.</p> <h2>Movie transfer from V+</h2> <p>I have a Virgin Media V+ box (similar to Sky+, although I've never used that). I'd like to copy one or two programmes so that I can watch them on any television. According to the V+ manual, you must use the Scart socket to do this. Can I hook this Scart socket to my laptop to make the copy there?<br><strong>Michael Smith </strong> </p> <p><strong>JS:</strong> Not as far as I know, and if you could, you'd need to capture the video signal in real time. The V+ system appears to work with DVD recorders, so you should be able to use the \"Copy to VCR/DVD\" option to save your programmes. (I don't have a V+ to try.) If you really wanted to keep a copy on your PC, you would have to rip this DVD in the way you usually would. </p> <h2>Managing Favorites </h2> <p>I can use <a href=\"http://Live.com\">Live.com</a> to tag my IE Favorites online, but I'd like to know if I can use folders to arrange them on my PC and then upload the folders to my IE. <br><strong>Manish Mohan</strong> </p> <p><strong>JS:</strong> You can always manipulate your Favorites bookmarks in Windows Explorer. Go to Documents and Settings, then to your user name and open the folder called Favorites. Each of your links is a separate shortcut file, and most of them should be stored in folders. You can drag and drop the files however you like. To create a new bookmark, right click in a folder, select New and then Shortcut.</p> <p>Nowadays, many people use online bookmark managers such as Live (<a href=\"http://favorites.live.com\">favorites.live.com</a>) for IE and Foxmarks (<a href=\"http://foxmarks.com\">foxmarks.com</a>) for Firefox because these are accessible from more than one computer. Delicious (<a href=\"http://delicious.com\">delicious.com</a>) is popular as a social bookmarking site. I've used Linkagogo (<a href=\"http://linkagogo.com\">linkagogo.com</a>) , but rarely access it unless I'm overseas. I'm currently trying Sync2it (<a href=\"http://linkagogo.com\">sync2it.com</a>) because it works with multiple browsers. There's a good selection of alternatives at Fileheap (<a href=\"http://bit.ly/aj0049\">bit.ly/aj0049</a>), or search at Download.com (<a href=\"http://bit.ly/aj0050\">bit.ly/aj0050</a>). </p> <h2>More backups</h2> <p>In last week's response to a query from Martin James regarding backups, you suggested using CD-R regularly. I'm surprised that you didn't suggest DVDs, or even a backup to an external (or internal) hard drive.<br><strong>Pete Edwards</strong></p> <p><strong>JS:</strong> A CD-R holds 700MB and not many people accumulate data so rapidly that they need the higher capacity of DVD. It works well for documents, which are usually small, and for photos, which don't benefit from compression. (I tend to chuck my mail folders into a WinRAR file.) Also, a write once CD-R rarely goes wrong, in my experience, so it provides an archive that should last for many years. External hard drives are great for continuous backups until you run out of space, but any hard drive can fail.</p> <h2>Backchat</h2> <p>\u2022 Phil Leahy's problem was that double-clicking folders in Windows Explorer changed from opening that folder to opening the Search dialogue. That also happened to Jamie Woods, who says: \"I cured it by going to Control Panel, Folder Options, File Types, Drives, Advanced, New, then typing 'open' as the Action, then browsing to c:\\windows\\explorer.exe as the Application Used to Perform Action, then highlighting 'open and setting it as the default action. I think this is better than tweaking the registry.\"</p>",
  "<p>Most people, if they bother to think about it at all, probably view the internet as an agent of profound change. In the 15 years since Tim Berners-Lee invented the world wide web, the life of almost everyone in the industrialised world has been touched by it. But just as many of us are getting to grips with its second stage, the mobile internet, very few are prepared - perhaps even aware - of the third and potentially most revolutionary phase of all: the internet of things.</p> <p>Sometime between now and 2010, the internet is poised to reach beyond virtual space and take root in the physical world. According to many futurist thinkers, almost every object you can see around you carries the possibility of being connected to the internet. This means that your domestic appliances, your clothes, the books on your shelves and your car in the driveway may one day soon be assigned a unique IP address, just as both computers and web pages are assigned them today, to enable them to talk to each other. </p> <p>'<strong>We can IP-enable it'</strong></p> <p>In the past month, a coalition of big technology companies, Cisco, Ericsson and Sun Microsystems among them, have formed the Ipso (IP for Smart Objects) Alliance with the aim of shaping a set of standards for the coming internet of things. \"We could incorporate internet protocol (IP) into nearly everything,\" enthuses Geoff Mulligan, chair of the Ipso Alliance. \"There's no reason why the internet shouldn't be in every single appliance.\"</p> <p>And he should know. Mulligan is one of the original architects of Arpanet, the proto-network built by the Pentagon that led directly to the wider internet we all use today. He believes that the connection of physical objects to the internet is the logical next step in its progression. \"The whole thing about IP is that it can run on almost any type of physical media,\" he explains. \"It doesn't care if it's Ethernet, power-line control or Bluetooth. Whatever it happens to be, we can IP-enable it.\"</p> <p>Now, the days of the internet as we know it are numbered, because the present IP address space - version 4 (usually called IPv4) - is going to hit its limit, even as early as 2010. It will be replaced by IPv6, which has addresses enough for about 3.4...1038 addresses, or 5x1028 for each of the 6.8 billion of us on earth. In other words, every human on the planet could have a personal network the size of the today's internet.</p> <p>One of the reasons that the internet needs so much address space (apart from the obvious reason that it doesn't want to run out again) is to create enough room for the internet of things. Already in Japan cows grazing in the fields of Hida Takayama have their own IPv6 addresses embedded on wireless RFID chips beneath their skin. Farmers can now track their livestock through the growth and distribution process.</p> <p>Back home, the first new IPv6 applications are likely to be in the control and sensor networks of expensive industrial machines, and then by business applications, probably in energy management. Mulligan cites the example of IP-enabled lights that can switch on an off as someone walks along a corridor, or rooms that are heated only when someone is present.</p> <p>After that, the internet of things is likely to extend into the home, with a range of IP-enabled appliances: smoke detectors, fridges, microwaves, water boilers - almost anything that is at present connected to the power grid is expected to get an IP address sometime in the future. \"Wouldn't it be cool if your smoke detector goes off and it told all of your gas appliances to turn off?\" suggests Mulligan. </p> <p>The trouble is that this vision of the smart home has been a staple of futurologist forecasts for decades and yet failed to become part of daily life. But what's different this time is the adoption of IP to standardise, and by extension popularise, a network of \"intelligent\" devices. Until recently the thinking has been that the adopters of such technology would be those keen to geekily control every aspect of their domesticity. But Tony Lucido, vice-president of marketing at Jennic, the Sheffield-based manufacturer of semiconductors and microchips (and a founding member of the Ipso Alliance) says utility companies - not individuals - could well drive the early adoption of the internet of things. \"Energy management is becoming a hot topic,\" he explains. \"Everyone is talking about conservation and using our energy more efficiently.\"</p> <p><strong>Smoothing the peaks</strong></p> <p>Lucido uses the example of how people are using wireless electricity meters, such as the Owl, that allow them to record their energy usage, in pence or Co2 per hour. \"The first phase is just displaying the energy usage within the home,\" he says. \"The next stage is remote energy management so that utility companies can find way to do load-shedding, [which helps] smooth off the peaks you get in energy usages. The way to do that it get access to people's appliances, let's say the washing machine, and at 5pm when energy usage is peaking. They will offer consumer discounts if they are allowed to control a few appliances in the home and shut them down for a few minutes during peak energy usage.\"</p> <p>That electricity usage should be the first major domestic application for the internet of things is something of a poetic beginning. For it was the late Mark Weiser, the former chief scientist at Xerox Parc, who first articulated the idea that ordinary household appliances could become embedded with information technology with his vision of ubiquitous computing. For Weiser, information technology was nothing more than a commodity, like electricity, that would become part of the fabric of everyday life.</p> <p>\"What a lot of people are doing these days is networking up their electricity meters in order to display their current energy consumption,\" says Usman Haque, a London-based architect and designer who believes the internet of things is already here. Last year, he launched a web service called <a href=\"http://pachube.com\">pachube.com</a>, which enables people to connect their devices and share real-time sensor data with each other. \"I compare it to YouTube, but rather than sharing videos you are sharing your sensor data,\" he says. \"The point really is to facilitate interaction between these devices. To open up the protocol, if you like, so the machines can communicate with each other.\" Since then everything from iceberg weather stations to river height sensing equipment to general building management systems have been connected to the network by a set of enthusiasts eager to experiment.</p> <p><strong>Coding the infrastructure</strong></p> <p>But, warns Haque, there could be disadvantages too. \"It depends whether we end up treating the internet of things as a system where we become enslaved to our devices, or whether we treat it as a truly open framework in which we are putting our devices and machines on to this system in order to facilitate our existence,\" he says. \"It could go either way.\"</p> <p>Few of the experts doubt that the internet of things will have a profound effect on the world, but what is apparent that there is no single authority designing it. Talk to any of the designers and coders building the infrastructure and each will tell you that they have private fears about a world where, as Wired magazine founder Kevin Kelly recently described it, \"the environment is the web\". Furthermore, the internet of things would have no on/off switch. It will arrive incrementally, one IP-enabled light switch at a time.</p> <p>In doing so, the internet of things promises to reshape our lives as fundamentally as the introduction of the railway, but with less public consent or even debate about its arrival. Before it does arrive, perhaps we could spare a moment to think what it might mean. As one day in the future you might even get assigned your own unique IP number. By then, of course, it will be too late to complain.</p>",
  "<p>Among the ways in which freedom is being chipped away in Europe, one of the less obvious is the legislation of memory. More and more countries have laws saying you must remember and describe this or that historical event in a certain way, sometimes on pain of criminal prosecution if you give the wrong answer. What the wrong answer is depends on where you are. In Switzerland, you get prosecuted for saying that the terrible thing that happened to the Armenians in the last years of the Ottoman empire was not a genocide. In Turkey, you get prosecuted for saying it was. What is state-ordained truth in the Alps is state-ordained falsehood in Anatolia.</p> <p>This week a group of historians and writers, of whom I am one, has pushed back against this dangerous nonsense. In what is being called the \"Appel de Blois\", published in Le Monde last weekend, we maintain that in a free country \"it is not the business of any political authority to define historical truth and to restrict the liberty of the historian by penal sanctions\". And we argue against the accumulation of so-called \"memory laws\". First signatories include historians such as Eric Hobsbawm, Jacques Le Goff and Heinrich August Winkler. It's no accident that this appeal originated in France, which has the most intense and tortuous recent experience with memory laws and prosecutions. It began uncontroversially in 1990, when denial of the Nazi Holocaust of the European Jews, along with other crimes against humanity defined by the 1945 Nuremberg tribunal, was made punishable by law in France - as it is in several other European countries. In 1995, the historian Bernard Lewis was convicted by a French court for arguing that, on the available evidence, what happened to the Armenians might not correctly be described as genocide according to the definition in international law.</p> <p>A further law, passed in 2001, says the French Republic recognises slavery as a crime against humanity, and this must be given its \"consequential place\" in teaching and research. A group representing some overseas French citizens subsequently brought a case against the author of a study of the African slave trade, Olivier P\u00e9tr\u00e9-Grenouilleau, on the charge of \"denial of a crime against humanity\". Meanwhile, yet another law was passed, from a very different point of view, prescribing that school curricula should recognise the \"positive role\" played by the French presence overseas, \"especially in North Africa\".</p> <p>Fortunately, at this point a wave of indignation gave birth to a movement called Liberty for History (<a href=\"http://www.lph-asso.fr//\">lph-asso.fr</a>), led by the French historian Pierre Nora, which is also behind the Appel de Blois. The case against P\u00e9tr\u00e9-Grenouilleau was dropped, and the \"positive role\" clause nullified. But it remains incredible that such a proposal ever made it to the statute book in one of the world's great democracies and homelands of historical scholarship.</p> <p>This kind of nonsense is all the more dangerous when it comes wearing the mask of virtue. A perfect example is the recent attempt to enforce limits to the interpretation of history across the whole EU in the name of \"combating racism and xenophobia\". A proposed \"framework decision\" of the justice and home affairs council of the EU, initiated by the German justice minister Brigitte Zypries, suggests that in all EU member states \"publicly condoning, denying or grossly trivialising crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes\" should be \"punishable by criminal penalties of a maximum of at least between one and three years imprisonment\".</p> <p>Who will decide what historical events count as genocide, crimes against humanity or war crimes, and what constitutes \"grossly trivialising\" them?</p> <p>International humanitarian law indicates some criteria, but exactly what events qualify is a matter of often heated dispute. The only cast-iron way to ensure EU-wide uniformity of treatment would be for the EU to agree a list - call it the Zypries List - of qualifying horrors. You can imagine the horse-trading behind closed doors in Brussels. (Polish official to French counterpart: \"OK, we'll give you the Armenian genocide if you give us the Ukrainian famine.\") Pure Gogol.</p> <p>Since some countries with a strong free-speech tradition, including Britain, objected to Zypries' original draft, the proposed agreement now also says: \"Member states may choose to punish only conduct which is either carried out in a manner likely to disturb public order or which is threatening, abusive or insulting.\" So in practice, individual countries will continue to do things their own way.</p> <p>Despite its manifold flaws, this framework decision was approved by the European Parliament in November 2007, but it has not been brought back to the justice and home affairs council for final approval. I emailed the relevant representative of the current French presidency of the EU to ask why, and just received this cryptic but encouraging reply: \"The FD 'Racism and xenophobia' is not ready for adoption, as it is suspended to some outstanding parliamentary reservations.\" Merci, madame libert\u00e9: that will do till the end of this year. Then let the Czech presidency of the EU, which covers the first half of next year, strike it down for good - with a dose of the Good Soldier Svejk's common sense about history.</p> <p>Let me be clear. I believe it is very important that nations, states, peoples and other groups (not to mention individuals) should face up, solemnly and publicly, to the bad things done by them or in their name. The West German leader Willy Brandt falling silently to his knees in Warsaw before a monument to the victims and heroes of the Warsaw Ghetto is, for me, one of the noblest images of postwar European history. For people to face up to these things, they have to know about them in the first place. So these subjects must be taught in schools as well as publicly commemorated. But before they are taught, they must be researched. The evidence must be uncovered, checked and sifted, and various possible interpretations tested against it.</p> <p>It's this process of historical research and debate that requires complete freedom - subject only to tightly drawn laws of libel and slander, designed to protect living persons but not governments, states or national pride (as in the notorious article 301 of the Turkish penal code). The historian's equivalent of a natural scientist's experiment is to test the evidence against all possible hypotheses, however extreme, and then submit what seems to him or her the most convincing interpretation for criticism by professional colleagues and for public debate. This is how we get as near as one ever can to truth about the past.</p> <p>How, for example, do you refute the absurd conspiracy theory, which apparently still has some currency in parts of the Arab world, that \"the Jews\" were behind the September 11 2001 terrorist attacks on New York? By forbidding anyone from saying that, on pain of imprisonment? No. You refute it by refuting it. By mustering all the available evidence, in free and open debate. This is not just the best way to get at the facts; ultimately, it's the best way to combat racism and xenophobia too.

It's vital to innovation. Companies like Google, and Yahoo, and eBay, and Amazon, and Skype and so on, got their start without having to get permission from any ISP or any broadband provider to offer services. They simply acquired access to the internet, put their services up and then made them available to the general public.</p> </blockquote> <p>So far, so much the usual explanation of net neutrality. But what does Obama offer? </p> <blockquote> <p>We think that's the best way for the Internet to evolve and I'm pleased to say that in the upcoming presidential elections, the two candidates have rather different views of this particular matter. Senator Obama in particular sees things the way I do which is that the Net should remain open, fully accessible and providing access on a non-discriminatory basis to the people who want to offer new services on the network. </p> </blockquote> <p>We had an <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/oct/02/interviews.internet\">exclusive interview with Cerf</a> at the start of October: he makes the case there again for the benefits of net neutrality.</p> <p>There are more scientists and technologists and their endorsements on the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/AVoteForScience\">AVoteForScience</a> channel on YouTube; safe to say that it's not seeing a huge amount of backing for John McCain and his creationist-backing running mate Sarah Palin - although McCain has been unusual among Republicans in accepting that climate change is real, important and urgent.

  "<p>The only surviving member of a group of six Iranian-Arab gunmen who seized the Iranian embassy in London in 1980 is to be released from prison, it was <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article4915976.ece\">reported</a> last week. Fowzi Badavi Nejad, now 50, was only 22 when he and the other gunmen took control of the embassy building, along with 26 hostages. Five hostages were released during the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/in_depth/uk/2000/iranian_embassy_siege/intro.stm\">six-day siege</a>; two were killed and 19 miraculously escaped, but emotionally scarred. I was one of the hostages.</p> <p>Nejad \u2013 alias Ali Ahmad Jassim \u2013 is being freed (if he hasn't been freed already) after serving 28 years in jail. He was given a life sentence in 1981 and his lawyer has been quoted as saying the parole board believes he is no longer a threat to society and can therefore be released.</p> <p>Is he really no threat to society? I believe he is not, despite the outrageous terroristic act he got himself involved in and the fear and anguish that he and his comrades-in-arms caused. Some, if not all, of us hostages are still suffering from that dreadful experience. </p> <p>On three occasions I have been asked to forgive Nejad but I have always refused \u2013 and I still do. The first time was a direct request almost 10 years after he was sentenced when he sent a letter from his prison cell to my work address at the BBC World Service. He explained at length in his letter that he had become a better person and had made enough progress in learning English to pursue academic study through the Open University.</p> <p>I thought really hard for many days whether I should reply to his letter. I discussed it with my wife and some fellow hostages and eventually decided not to. I was still full of anger. Nejad to me was, after all, still a member of a terroristic group who had taken innocent civilians by force subjected them, day after day, to unspeakable terror and mental anguish as well as possible death. </p> <p>I understand I was the only hostage Nejad had written to, for two reasons. First I was the only Arab-speaking hostage in the embassy whom he and the other gunmen could use as a channel of communication with the non-Farsi speaking hostages and, at times, for negotiation with the security forces outside. Second, and more importantly, I had spent some time with him during the siege talking about Middle East politics and listening to stories about his family in Iran's southern province of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khuzestan\">Khuzestan</a> (Arabestan) before he fled to Iraq.</p> <p>He was a simple and naive kid coming to a western capital for the first time but with a gun in his hand. Nejad looked so harmless. Not only he had been the youngest of his group, but he looked like a European \u2013 a good-looking but skinny young man with hardly any trace of hair on his face. I was deeply terrified when he told me what sort of brief he and his group were given just before they were brutally dispatched by their Iraqi <em>mukhabarat</em> (intelligence) mentors, Sami and Hadi. </p> <p>\"Don't worry, sons,\" they said. \"The police in Britain do not carry weapons and their main function is to help the elderly cross the streets. They will not attack you.\" When I conveyed this piece of information to my fellow hostages, PC Trevor Lock and BBC sound engineer Sim Harris, they were equally terrified.</p> <p>Nejad's father, dead long ago, had been a local civil servant and Nejad left his mother and two sisters back in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khorramshahr\">Khorramshahr</a> when he fled to Iraq (they are believed to be now living in Sweden as refugees). At the age of 18 he had joined the Iranian army and spent two years doing national service before returning home and starting work as head labourer in the docks.<br> Later, I and two other hostages were approached twice on behalf of Nejad by a representative of a UK-based film production company (not to be named) to sign a statement as a part of what was described as a \"Free Nejad campaign\". The first time was in 1996, 15 years after passing the sentence, and the second in 2001 to coincide with 20 years of his life sentence. </p> <p>The campaigners thought they had a chance of getting him paroled on these two occasions, but they were wrong. The campaign lawyer had written to us claiming the British government intended to free Nejad but could not do so because he would face the death penalty if he was deported back to Iran, and because Britain could not find a country to accept him as a refugee. I declined the first request but approved the second. It is time that Nejad proves to himself the lesson he learned from his 28 years imprisonment.</p> <p><em>Mustapha Karkouti is a former president of the Foreign Press Association, London. </em></p>",

In fact, half his family is so black that Obama keeps them hidden away on a whole other continent where they speak in a strange, otherworldly code which is not even English. What is Obama trying to hide? Possibly something black. <strong>BONUS FACT!</strong> Barack Obama may be half-white and half-black, but he married a woman who is completely black.

  "<p>You can't say Germans lack a sense of humour. The other day in Berlin, some passers-by stopped at the chancellery opposite the Reichstag building and flashed some cash. They wanted to know how big their share would be in the \u20ac500bn bail-out that the government had just announced. He would prefer to pay straight away, one man said. Perhaps he didn't qualify for the cabaret with that one, but at least he showed some wit in the face of the financial meltdown.</p> <p>Which is more than can be said for some representatives of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A4nder\">Laender</a>. <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/americasDealsNews/idUSTRE49C7X620081013\">In general</a>, they applauded <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financetopics/financialcrisis/3190637/Banking-bail-out-German-savers-flock-to-state-owned-banks.html\">the rescue plan</a>. But when the prime ministers of German federal states such as Hesse and Thuringia were told that their share of financing it would be as high as 35%, their <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601100&amp;sid=aCaSfcqFClqo&amp;refer=germany\">reactions were unsurprising</a>. The states shouldn't pay for the bail-out, regional governments said (namely those run by Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrat party). <a href=\"http://www.euronews.net/en/article/14/10/2008/merkel-defends-500-billion-bail-out/\">Horst Seehofer</a>, the outgoing federal minister of agriculture and designated prime minister of Bavaria, knew where his loyalty now lies \u2013 with his land.</p> <p>But Merkel has no time for the intricacies of German federalism. One emergency meeting follows another these days. She wants the rescue plan signed by President Horst Koehler on Friday. The news of the rescue plan went down well. German stocks rallied, on course for the steepest two-day gain on record. The DAX Index jumped 11% on Monday, <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601100&amp;sid=arFHegJv7yW8&amp;refer=germany\">the highest gain</a> since the measure was created in 1988.

But people are also pondering the sheer amount of guarantees European governments were prepared to give. Together they clearly exceed the US plan, suggesting that the risks the European governments are trying to get under control are much bigger than so far assumed. Additionally, for Germany the \u20ac500bn come at the price of missing its growth target in forthcoming years.</p> <p>Merkel also indicated that another billion-euro package could follow soon. Europe had to find a way to react to the \"massive help\" the Americans are paying to their car industry, she said. Europe has to make sure that it is not going into an economic recession once the financial crisis is contained. Yet, the idea of state intervention should not be randomly applied to other industries. Promising state money to other afflicted sectors could be a fatal signal. Besides, Merkel mentioning aid payments for the car industry evokes the old fight over subsidies between Europe and the US.</p>",
  "<p>Driving around the Sudanese capital of Khartoum, you would scarcely imagine that not very far away in Darfur, thousands of Sudanese are suffering <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Darfur\">the ravages of war</a>. There is little awareness of the conflict and even less concern for its victims. Through a fog of apathy and misplaced national pride there is a belief that not only is president <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/english/docs/2005/12/09/sudan12186.htm\">Omar al-Bashir</a> innocent of war crimes and human rights abuses but also that the situation on the ground has been blown out of proportion \u2013 part-fabricated and seized upon by western media egged on by western regimes seeking to undermine the Sudanese government.<br> Claims that there is some <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/28/sudan.humanrights\">popular support</a> inside Sudan for the president's indictment fail to grasp the power of nationalist sentiment or \u2013 more importantly \u2013 the Sudanese tradition of political impunity. Due to a combination of incestuous monopolistic tribal and familial structures and the lack of institutionalised political processes, parties and loyalties, there is no culture of censure and punishment for crimes past. Moreover, when punishment is sought from foreign sources, resistance to the idea becomes <a href=\"http://www.sudaneseonline.com/en2/publish/Latest_News_1/Sudan_Rallies_Behind_Leader_Reviled_Abroad.shtml\">even fiercer</a>.</p> <p>Most Sudanese maintain this readiness to forgive is part of their peace-loving nature \u2013 an explanation that is hard to take seriously.</p> <p>President <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaafar_Nimeiry\">Gaafar Nimeiry</a> who seized power in a political coup in 1969 was overthrown in a rare popular uprising in 1985 and fled to exile in Egypt. During his reign, the execution of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmoud_Mohamed_Taha\">Mahmoud Mohammed Taha</a>, an Islamic thinker who argued against the imposition of sharia law, shook Sudanese society to its core and Taha's apotheosis as a martyr in the face of barbarism exalted him, both to his party's devotees and the nation at large. Indeed, the regime crumbled only weeks after his execution. </p> <p>It was inconceivable when Nimeiry fled that he would not only be allowed to return to Sudan but run for election in 2000, a senile laughing stock of a fallen despot. Taha's Republican party adherents all but disappeared, abandoning the political arena or going into exile where they continue to dine out on their political asylum status in the west.<br> Nimeiry was followed by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadiq_al-Mahdi\">Sadiq al-Mahdi</a> who personified the impotence of those who believe they are entitled to power <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,836150,00.html\">due to ancestry</a> and not capability. In 1989 his inept government was dispatched by a military coup amid accusations of nepotism and incompetence. Mahdi was imprisoned but then fled abroad, spending years as the bastion of opposition before he returned to Khartoum to head his own splinter of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umma_Party\">Umma political party</a>, joining Nimeiry and other ex-ministers for whom the worst fate is not the suffering of the Sudanese people but their own marginalisation. Indeed, Mahdi recently expressed support for Bashir in the face of the Hague indictment. His tenacity is not to be scoffed at. During his career he has been written off several times only to resurface at the hubs of power <br> The current government launched itself in a barrage of civil society purges, imprisonments and executions. In the wake of the 1989 coup, a counter-coup from within the ranks of the military (planned by those who viewed the alliance of elements of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Islamic_Front\">National Islamic Front</a> and the army as a danger to the military establishment) was foiled and 28 officers, some of whom were close friends and colleagues of Bashir and one of whom was my father's cousin, were executed. </p> <p>Those alienated by such brutal measures left the country and set up livelihoods abroad, broken by the loss of their positions or the horrors seen while incarcerated. Years later, many of these have returned, part out of homesickness and part out of disillusionment. Khartoum is a city where you run into your former jailer but look the other way for fear of making a scene. </p> <p>Social relationships stand in the way of retribution. Mahdi and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hassan_al-Turabi\">Hassan al-Turabi</a>, the mastermind of the 1989 coup, are brothers-in-law \u2013 a situation which precipitated an absurd political stalemate between the two adversaries. </p> <p>Political loyalties are changeable and alliances fleeting due to the unsophisticated nature of governance since independence where regime after regime has been truncated before processes were properly established. Only a dogged political elite remained. </p> <p>This created a vicious cycle where the primary concern of a fledgling government was to establish itself at all costs. In each government's wake there were victims who came to understand that the exigencies of politics in Sudan are ephemeral and shift like quicksand while the realities of survival and social credibility are less fickle. </p> <p>It is mostly down to this and not to some grand movement of national reconciliation or some abstract notion of the forgiving nature of the Sudanese that political memories are short and there is little appetite for seeking redress in the international criminal court.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/us\">US</a> troops will withdraw from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/iraq\">Iraq</a> by the end of 2011 and American and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/military\">British soldiers</a> deployed there in the interim period could face prosecution in Iraq's courts for serious, premeditated \"off-duty\" crimes, under the terms of a draft status of forces agreement outlined today by officials in Baghdad and Washington.</p> <p>The draft agreement, which is intended to replace the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/unitednations\">UN</a> security council mandate that legitimised the US-led invasion in March 2003, and subsequent occupation, follows months of fraught negotiations. It must be ratified by the Iraqi parliament before the end of the year.</p> <p>Passage is far from guaranteed. Iraq's most influential Shia cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani, said last week that any pact must have the support of Iraq's people and political parties before it could be endorsed. Some of the deal's terms may prove controversial in the US.</p> <p>The agreement, if implemented, would mark a potentially significant milestone in the slow, often painful evolution of independent, Iraqi self-government since the overthrow of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/saddam\">Saddam Hussein</a> five years ago. It represents a climbdown by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/georgebush\">Bush</a> administration, which had previously refused to set a deadline or timetable for a troop withdrawal.</p> <p>Ali al-Dabbagh, the Iraqi government spokesman, said US forces would pull out of Iraqi towns and villages by the middle of next year and withdraw from the country as a whole by December 31 2011. He left open the possibility that some US and other forces might be asked to stay beyond that date if the Iraqi government felt they were needed.</p> <p>\"The withdrawal is to be achieved in three years,\" al-Dabbagh said. \"In 2011 the government at that time will determine whether it needs a new pact or not. What type of pact will depend on the challenges it faces.\"</p> <p>Al-Dabbagh indicated that US troops and Pentagon contractors would be subject to US law while on base or conducting off-base \"military missions\" \u2013 a potentially catch-all definition, since US forces rarely venture off-base unless under orders.</p> <p>\"Iraqi judicial law will be implemented in case these forces commit a serious and deliberate felony outside their military bases and when off-duty,\" he said. In such instances, American offenders would be held in US custody but could be surrendered to the Iraqi authorities for questioning and possible trial.</p> <p>A series of incidents allegedly involving US forces and Pentagon employees that led to the deaths of Iraqi civilians and, in one case, the alleged rape of a 14-year-old girl has outraged public opinion and added to pressure for tougher rules.</p> <p>Officials in Washington confirmed today that a compromise on prosecutions and a withdrawal date had been reached, but urged caution. \"There is a text that people are looking at,\" a state department spokesman said. \"Nothing is done until everything is done. Everything isn't done. The Iraqis are still talking among themselves. We are still talking to the Iraqis.\"</p> <p>The draft agreement would prevent the US military from continuing to hold Iraqi suspects without charging them with crimes under Iraqi law. At present, a majority of the 18,000 people held by coalition forces have not been charged with any offence.</p> <p>British soldiers serving in Iraq are likely to be subject to the new rules from next year. Asked this week about the future status of British forces, the Ministry of Defence said: \"Our requirements are very similar to those of the US. We intend to use the Iraqi/US text as the basis of our agreement.\"</p> <p>The mooted deal comes against a backdrop of growing pressure from Iraqi public opinion and from Iraq's powerful majority-Shia neighbour, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/iran\">Iran</a>, for the departure of US and other foreign forces. Iraq's nationalist prime minister, Nouri al-Maliki, has moved successfully in recent months to assert indigenous army and police control over areas such as Basra, although levels of violence have been slowly rising again in recent weeks.</p> <p>The draft appears to put to rest reports earlier this year that the US was secretly planning to maintain bases in Iraq indefinitely as part of \"an open-ended military presence\" in the country. Key issues vital to the future of Iraq as a functioning, integrated democracy \u2013 including day-to-day security, future relations between the Shia-led government and the Sunni Awakening movement, the status of Kirkuk and how to share oil revenues \u2013 remain unresolved and could upset all these calculations.</p>",
  "<p>A brain implant has allowed paralysed monkeys to move their limbs \u2013 by tapping into their thoughts and redirecting the signals to their muscles \u2013 scientists announced today. The feat is being seen as a major development in the hunt for treatments for people who have lost the use of their limbs due to major spinal cord injuries or strokes. </p> <p>Doctors hope the implant will one day allow severely disabled people to use mind control to regain movement of their arms and legs.</p> <p>The work is the first to show that signals from single brain cells can be re-routed around damaged areas of the central nervous system, restoring function to paralysed limbs. Previously, scientists have shown that monkeys fitted with brain implants can move robotic arms or cursors on a screen. </p> <p>Scientists involved in the experiments yesterday sought to dampen hopes that the technique would be ready to help disabled people in the near future, but others said they expected to see the first human trials within five years. More advanced versions of the implant could give people with paralysed legs the ability to walk again, and eventually give paraplegics control over all their limbs, including very precise movements of the hands and arms.</p> <p>In the study, which appears in the journal Nature, scientists at Washington University in Seattle implanted ultra-thin electrodes into the brains of macaques trained to play a game that involved rotating their wrist to the left and right. While the monkeys played, the electrodes picked up electrical signals in their brains that made them tense different muscles.</p> <p>The scientists then injected the monkeys with a chemical that temporarily paralysed their arms. This time, signals from nerves in their brains were fed into a computer, cleaned up and magnified, and sent down a wire to muscles in the monkeys' wrists.</p> <p>When the monkeys tried to play the game again, they were unable to at first, but soon learned to control their wrist movements using the brain implant. </p> <p>Astonishingly, even when the implant was connected to nerves that were not involved in wrist control, the monkeys learned how to change their brain activity to control the same actions.</p> <p>\"The monkey was experimenting with different types of movement and different types of cognitive activity to drive those neurons and when he found something worked, he quickly repeated it and adopted the strategy,\" said Ebehard Fetz, who led the study.</p> <p>Future work on the system will focus on miniaturising the technology and developing wireless networks to send the brain's signals around damaged parts of the spine to limbs that have lost their connections to the brain.</p> <p>As it stands, researchers have several major hurdles to overcome before the technique could safely be used in humans. The first is to remove the need for wires, which increase the risk of infection. The second problem is that when electrodes are put into the brain, they gradually become encapsulated in scar tissue, which reduces their ability to read signals from individual neurons. The latest study suggests, though, that as long as the electrodes have a good contact with at least one neuron, it will still be possible to control muscle movements.</p> <p>Chet Moritz, who worked on the study, said the team is looking at another potentially more powerful way of using the implant to control paralysed limbs. Instead of re-directing brain signals to individual muscles in a limb, they can be sent into the spinal cord to stimulate several nerves that together trigger a group of muscles to do a specific job, such as grasp a mug, or kick a ball. </p> <p>\"If you stimulate directly in the spinal cord, that will often activate 10 to 15 muscles in a precise balance that produces a grasping movement or a stepping movement,\" Moritz said.</p> <p>Lee Miller at Northwestern University in Chicago, who recently showed how monkeys could control their limbs using signals from bunches of brain cells, said: \"This is the first instance when activity from a single neuron in the brain has been used to control a paralysed limb rather than a robotic arm or a cursor on a screen. I'd certainly hope that within the next five years there will be at least experimental applications being tried out in humans.\"</p>",

The job is not for the faint-hearted. </p> <p>Winning the confidence of the Muslim community while also putting a positive spin on the government's counter-terror strategy arguably requires someone with Tom Cruise's approach to Impossible Missions. </p> <p>Have a look at the spec required of the successful applicant who must</p> <blockquote> <p><br>... develop an understanding of communities and how they are reacting in real time, providing feedback and contacts to enable OSCT [Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism] to ascertain true community reaction ... [and ensure the] positive public perception of counter terrorism activities within our communities and ensure work is clearly and accurately explained to the community in a cogent and understandable format. </p> </blockquote> <p>Presumably, the individual would be responsible for showing Muslims the silver lining of being <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/jun/11/uksecurity.terrorism\">banged up</a> and detained without charge while relaying back to the <a href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/\">Home Office</a> local reaction to a dawn raid.</p> <p>And what else is the Home Office expecting for a maximum salary of \u00a370,000? </p> <blockquote> <p>Evidence of credibility and gravitas with Muslims, insight and credibility in working with religious groups and communities, evidence of the credible establishment of community organizations at local, regional and national level, evidence of using reputational/ambassadorial ability in the context of engaging local communities. </p> </blockquote> <p>Reading between the lines it looks like the Home Office is hungering for a little more than is available in its <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/jun/11/uksecurity.terrorism\">existing arsenal</a> to win the war on terror, hardly a vote of confidence for those already helping the Home Office on security and cohesion issues, although home secretary Jacqui Smith might simply be adopting a \"more is more\" approach to the issue. </p> <p>It also appears that the government is looking for someone who all Muslims will respect and want to work with, which is not an easy ask. </p> <p>Happily, the Home Office is confident of making a decision in early December and the individual with one of the most impossible jobs in Whitehall will emerge blinking into the sun.</p> <p>Right now though the questions are: who should get the job, who will get the job and is such a post needed?</p>",
  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> Calgary, Canada. <br> <strong>The lineup:</strong> Patrick Flegel (guitar), Matthew Flegel (bass), Michael Wallace (drums), Christopher Reimer (guitar).<br> <strong>The background:</strong> Someone has just written a blog about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2008/oct/14/difficult-albums-nico\">Nico's album The Marble Index</a> in which the distinction is drawn between music that is good, and music that is good for you; music that is easily enjoyable, and music that is more difficult and demanding but, with patience and an acceptance that sometimes the least pleasant things are the best for you, will ultimately improve the quality of your existence. Women, a four-piece from Canada, probably belong in the latter category. Their eponymous debut album of lo-fi st\u00fcrm und drang, due in January 2009, isn't exactly Metal Machine Music or even Trout Mask Replica, but potential pop hits are few and far between; don't expect <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/oct/10/new-band-stonefoxx\">Stonefoxx</a> to be performing cover versions any time soon. <br> It's a record of idiosyncratic arrangements and undanceable rhythms, of hiss, static and noise, of abrupt jolts of tempo and riffs that emerge in the mix then just as suddenly disappear. Compositional left-turns are commonplace. Quivering voices are propped up by picks scraping against strings. Opening track Cameras lasts a mere 60 seconds before segueing into the ear-punishing industrial scree of Lawncare. Woodbine is a three-minute one-note drone. January 8th is like Wire, only without the melodic quotient. Flashlights is sluggish and atonal, like Sonic Youth at 18rpm. Black Rice is like a late-60s psych-pop group trapped in a charnel house. Shaking Hand, at just under five minutes, is the longest track on the album, with the jittery precision of early REM or Orange Juice at their most awkward and jangly. Throughout, the guitars \u2013 the sounds they issue enhanced by self-made effects pedals \u2013 angrily pan across the stereo range. Overall, listening to Women, recorded over four months on ghetto blasters and old tape machines in producer and Sub Pop artist Chad VanGaalen's basement, one is reminded of those post-punk bands that prioritised curiosity, noisy experimentation and sly artifice over entryism and mainstream subversion.  Even the CD sleeve \u2013 a creepily synchronised group tai chi exercise in a communist state \u2013 appears to have been designed to maximum disruptive effect and with minimal regard for mass appeal. But it won't just be you, the listener, who recoils from the record, unsure of whether you've just been entertained or exposed to something unconscionably unsettling. The band themselves are in two minds about it. \"That was the main goal, putting a record out that we're happy with now,\" they say. \"Maybe five years from now we'll hate it. There's a pretty good chance that two weeks from now we'll hate it. We kind of hate it already.\" <strong>The buzz:</strong> \"This is freak-rock, nursed on psychedelia and prog, but without pretence.\"<br> <strong>The truth:</strong> Yes, but will it do you any good? One to quickly put at the front of your record collection when your cool friends come round, we think. <br> <strong>Most likely to:</strong> Make you scream. <br> <strong>Least likely to:</strong> Make you want to do tai chi. <br> <strong>What to buy:</strong> Women is released by Jagjaguwar on January 19 2009. <br> <strong>File next to:</strong> Pavement, Swans, Swell Maps, This Heat. <br> <strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/womenmusic\">www.myspace.com/womenmusic</a><br><a href=\"http://www.jagjaguwar.com/artist.php?name=women\">www.jagjaguwar.com/artist.php?name=women</a></p> <p><strong>Tomorrow's new band:</strong> Baddies.</p>",
  "<p>A senior firearms officer today told an inquest he \"felt sorry\" for the marksmen who shot Jean Charles de Menezes after finding them \"covered in blood\".</p> <p>His voice cracking with emotion, the inspector, known as Trojan 84, told an inquest he saw the two firearms officers moments after the innocent Brazilian was shot seven times from point blank range in a tube carriage at Stockwell station, in south London.</p> <p>Recalling meeting the pair in a tunnel the station, he said: \"I just remember feeling sorry for them at that point.</p> <p>\"The reason for that was because they were covered in blood.\"</p> <p>Trojan 84, who was at the scene relaying messages from the operations room at New Scotland Yard, described the shooting as a \"tragedy\". </p> <p>\"We thought we had caught a suicide bomber - it turned out we had killed an innocent man,\" he said.</p> <p>De Menezes, who had been mistaken for Hussain Osman, one of the failed July 21 2005 bombers, was shot after boarding a tube train.</p> <p>Trojan 84, who briefed the marksmen who shot and killed the 27-year-old, said he could not remember telling other officers that De Menezes had \"launched himself\" at the gunmen before they fired.</p> <p>He also claimed he could not recall the details of a \"brief\" conversation with the pair in the wake of the incident.</p> <p>Speaking from behind a screen as he gave evidence in open court for the first time, Trojan 84 admitted there was a culture of \"paranoia\" surrounding the incident.</p> <p>He said he feared claims of \"collusion\" and \"collaboration\" in the aftermath of events, and admitted that better systems of debriefing could be in place for officers.</p> <p>\"When an operation is thought to be unsuccessful, people row to the shore and we are left to mop up what's left,\" he said. \"That's why there's a paranoia.\"</p> <p>Earlier, he said officers were ready to take a \"critical\" shot at De Menezes if the Metropolitan police Deputy Assistant Commissioner, Cressida Dick, was unable to make the \"career-threatening decision\".</p> <p>\"We felt that for any DSO [designated senior officer, such as Dick] to make a decision about a critical shot was a hugely difficult decision to make, and maybe career-threatening,\" he added.</p> <p>\"In relation to the critical shot, the instruction would come direct from the DSO, but what I also mentioned was that if we were able to challenge but the subject was not compliant, then a shot may be taken.\"</p> <p>When asked whether officers were prepared to take the critical shot without word from higher up, he replied: \"Yes.\"</p> <p>\"It was my job to tell the team they would be supported whatever decision they took because of the structures that were in place,\" he added.</p> <p>The inquest heard how firearms police were not deployed on transport networks after the July 7 London bombings because officers were busy elsewhere.</p> <p>Chief Inspector Vince Esposito, the senior adviser in the operations room at New Scotland Yard, said officers patrolling the underground were unarmed despite increased security fears.</p> <p>Even after the failed attacks of July 21, uniformed police were not carrying weapons on the morning De Menezes was killed at Stockwell tube station, he said.</p> <p>The experienced firearms officer, who joined the Metropolitan force in 1980 and helped develop Scotland Yard's anti-terror tactics, said De Menezes was shot in a \"calm\" and \"controlled\" manner.</p> <p>\"Everybody is human and we all get excited occasionally, but it is the training that enables us to carry out the duties as happened on this day in a calm and controlled manner,\" Esposito said.</p> <p>He said armed intervention was used in only the most \"extreme\" circumstances, and De Menezes would have been shot whether or not he had been carrying a rucksack.</p> <p>When asked whether De Menezes could have concealed explosives on his body or in his pockets, he replied: \"It is very difficult indeed to say if he was carrying an explosive device.\"</p> <p>The jury, at the Oval cricket ground, also in south London, was told yesterday how De Menezes was \"virtually dead\" from the moment he got off a bus to go to the tube station.</p> <p>The inquest, due to last 12 weeks, was adjourned until tomorrow.</p>",
  "<p>The University and College Union has denied exceeding its legal powers in asking its members to question their contacts with Israel, following a court threat by its own members.</p> <p>According to the UCU, it would be lawful for any English university considering setting up links with an Israeli counterpart to consider the moral and political debate surrounding Israel's actions towards the Palestinian people.</p> <p>The union is facing a court threat from some of its own members unless it retracts a resolution, passed at this year's national conference, which asks academics to consider the ethical implications of their links with Israeli institutions.</p> <p>Solicitors Mishcon de Reya say that a group of as yet anonymous litigants, who are UCU members, are demanding repayment of any union funds spent on carrying out the conference resolution.</p> <p>The litigants are also demanding that UCU's trustees \u2013 Professor Neil Macfarlane, Fawzi Ibrahim, Dr Dennis Wright and Paul Russell \u2013 be forced to reimburse personally any money that has been spent.</p> <p>But the union says no money has been spent, apart from one article in UCU's magazine about the resolution. It adds in its reply to the solicitors that is prepared to confirm that no further cash will be spent until the status of the resolution has been determined in court.</p> <p>In its response, UCU's leadership suggests that a court case would be excessive.

  "<p><strong>CHERCHEZ LES CLOWNS</strong></p> <p>It's unlike someone in football to scramble about pathetically seeking transparently lame excuses for their abject failure, isn't it? So the Fiver will have to take Rio Ferdinand's assertion that Teamengland had become a \"circus\" during the 2006 World Cup thanks to the presence in Baden-Baden of the Wags at face value. How difficult it must have been for Rio and his team-mates to concentrate on training and kicking a ball, while there were some other people in a town several miles away wearing clothes and shoes and going to the shops. Yes, how difficult it must have been.</p> <p>\"People were worrying more about what people were wearing and where they were going out, rather than the England football team,\" said Rio yesterday. \"That then transposed itself into the team. That's said in hindsight. When you step back and look back at that, it was like a circus.\" The statement has been met with almost universal approval by the footballing press, which is either happy that the ultra-professional Fabio Capello has signalled his unwillingness to let families tag along to the next tournament England qualify for, or are simply happy to perpetuate any lazy <em>cherchez-la-femme</em> misogyny, given that England's laughably inept performances in Germany could hardly be blamed on Cheryl Cole being papped while coming out of a restaurant holding a new clutch bag.</p> <p>Perhaps it would have been better looking closer to home for England's failings. Ferdinand himself prepared for the tournament by filming the ITV prank series Rio's World Cup Wind-Ups, a lobotomised laugh-free zone which saw him spend months setting up elaborate stings to goad people with learning difficulties. His manager Sven-Goran Eriksson, meanwhile, had spent the best part of five years running around London recreating some of Benny Hill's finest end-credit chases.

The news will come as a disappointment to the big-boned out-of-favour Irish midfielder, who is notoriously fond of beef, particularly in its double-bacon-cheeseburger-with-all-the-trimmings form. But in the wake of reports suggesting the pair fell out after O'Ireland's recent win over Georgia in Mainz, manager O'Trapp continues to gesticulate furiously that all is well between them. \"There is no problem. We have a big qualifier and I don't understand why Andy Reid is more important than other situations,\" he continued, showing he has yet to get to grips with his new Irish language of English, by putting the words \"big\" and \"important\" in the wrong places.</p> <p>Of course O'Trapp's predecessor, Stan \"Steve\" Staunton also had a reputation for putting things in the wrong places; usually his foot in his mouth or Andy O'Brien's name on his team-sheet for Ireland's 5-2 humiliation at the hands of tonight's opponents Cyprus two years ago. With Steven Reid out injured, Trapp has overlooked his immobile namesake and opted to include Manchester United reserve Darron Gibson alongside Stoke City reserve Glenn Whelan in a central midfield partnership that has notched up a whopping four club appearances this season. Huffing and puffing up and down the wings alongside them will be Damien Duff, who regularly lines up for Newcastle but rarely plays, and Aiden McGeady, who is peerless when it comes to dribbling around the training cones that pass for defenders in the lower reaches of the Eurodisney League.</p> <p>Despite this openly risky selection policy (did we mention that enthusiastic but limited accident waiting to happen Paul McShane is playing?), in Trapp the Irish public continues to trust. And why not? The man is Italian, is not Staunton, is given to describing his players as \"serene\" and insists his \"team must play like a blind man\". Considering this was one of very few tactics mastered by his predecessor, the inflatable shamrock brigade will be hoping their elderly new manager means \"blind\" in the apparently telepathic sense of the word.</p> <p><em>Follow the Republic O'Ireland's nervy win over Cyprus <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/oct/15/republicofireland-cyprus-worldcup2010-minutebyminute\">here</a> and the ongoing inability of Wales internationals to score from the penalty-spot, this time against Germany, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/oct/15/germany-wales-worldcup2010-minutebyminute\">here</a> from 7pm.</em></p> <p>*********************</p> <p><strong>Guardian Fantasy Football</strong></p> <p>Go on, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fantasyfootball\">play it</a>.</p> <p><strong>Guardian Pick the Score</strong></p> <p>Go on, <a href=\"http://guardian.pickthescore.co.uk/\">pick it</a>.</p> <p><strong>Guardian Soulmates</strong></p> <p>Go on, <a href=\"http://dating.theguardian.com/s/\">trawl it</a>.

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/iceland\">Iceland</a> rushed to stave off economic ruin today by slashing interest rates by 3.5% and pursuing talks with Russia over the possibility of a multibillion euro loan. </p> <p>But despite the cut, which brought the policy rate down from a record high of 15.5%, the central bank issued a bleak forecast, predicting the collapse of Iceland's banks would be \"extremely burdensome\" and the economic contraction \"very sharp\". </p> <p>In a statement warning of numerous job losses and reduced market demand, the bank noted: \"The Icelandic economy has been subjected to unprecedented turbulence in the past few weeks. The banking system has not been able to withstand the trials it has faced as a result of difficult market conditions, global deterioration of confidence in economic affairs, and domestic risk appetite. </p> <p>\"A variety of jobs have disappeared virtually in the blink of an eye, demand has declined precipitously and, by all measures, expectations are at a low ebb.\"</p> <p>As the team of Icelandic officials sat down with their Russian counterparts for a second day of bail-out negotiations in Moscow, the country drew on swap facilities with Denmark and Norway, tapping them each for \u20ac200m (\u00a3155m) to kickstart its currency markets. </p> <p>The country has already accepted a \u00a3100m loan from the UK government to help it repay depositors in Landsbanki, one of the three Icelandic banks nationalised last week after the country's banking system fell apart.</p> <p>Iceland is also due to present a plan to the International Monetary Fund over the next few days and is widely expected to seek funds further afield.</p> <p>The country has endured years of high interest rates as its central bank struggled to control inflation. A collapse of the Icelandic krona exacerbated the situation as the island nation is heavily dependent on imported goods.</p> <p>Asgeir Jonsson, an analyst at Kaupthing, which was nationalised along with Landsbanki and Glitnir last week, welcomed the interest rate cut.</p> <p>\"It will help companies that will now have to be financed by Icelandic banks,\" he said. \"Going forward, we will not see any serious inflation in 2009 given that 20% of the CPI [consumer price index] is the housing market.

  "<p>After months of speculation, reports today suggest that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/oct/15/madonna-to-divorce\">Madonna and Guy Ritchie's marriage could be over</a>. While divorce and separation is an increasingly common path for adults to take without necessarily losing their way for long in a post-matrimonial forest of misery, the route is far bumpier for many of the children affected by family breakdown. Madonna and Ritchie have one son together, Rocco, as well as a recently adopted son, David, while Madonna has a daughter, Lourdes, from a previous relationship.</p> <p>Today, a study of 1,000 children under the age of 15 from both separated families and those still intact, is published. The children were asked to gauge their personal happiness on a scale from one to 10. One in four children from a separated family don't consider themselves to be happy compared with only one in 10 from a family still together. In addition, children whose parents are separated are more likely not to want children themselves and have fewer friends. </p> <p>The study was conducted by the <a href=\"http://www.separatedfamilies.info/\">Centre for Separated Families</a>, ahead of a conference, \"Best practise in supporting separated families\", on Thursday. It echoes the results, published in July, of the <a href=\"http://www.cls.ioe.ac.uk/text.asp?section=000100020003\">national child development study</a>, that has tracked around 17,000 people born in Britain in one week in 1958.</p> <p>The participants are now nearing their 50th birthdays. The <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2269144/Divorce-still-damaging-to-children-despite-being-more-acceptable.html\">latest results compared</a> the lives of those whose parents had split up with those of other sample groups born in earlier and later years. </p> <p>Researchers found that the children of separated families born in 1958 and 1970 were more likely to have no qualifications, claim benefits and suffer depression than the offspring of intact families. They were also more likely to experience their own relationship breakdown. These trends allow us to make predictions \u2013 \"more likely\" \u2013 not say anything for certain, but they still make for a potentially bleak future.</p> <p>What might improve outcomes? Parents who continue to treat the family as one, even when their own union is divided help. (Bruce Willis and Demi Moore seem to have got the hang of it.) </p> <p>\"We recognise that the children who do best after family separation are those that have a strong and positive input from both parents,\" says Karen Woodall, director of the centre. </p> <p>Or, to put it another way, mother and father need to act like grown-ups but in what is often a storm of anger, contempt, rejection, disappointment, concern over money or just old-fashioned hurt, that's not so easy to do. Unless, that is, the system won't accept anything less than parents who put the child's interests first.</p> <p>For years, government has pussyfooted around the post-separation family and still hasn't got it right. The early interventions project, based on a successful idea of therapeutic justice in the US and Canada, could have made a difference. Parents would have been given support to settle their affairs without resort to the courts. They would have been required to attend a course that reminded them of the importance of taking the children into account. They would have been encouraged to understand that \u2013 unless there is violence and/or abuse \u2013 two parents are better than one in a child's life.</p> <p>More importantly, unless there was very good reason to make an exception, the courts would expect a child to see the non-resident parent very regularly, no ifs or buts. And if the resident parent kept blocking or disrupting the arrangement, jail would be the ultimate sanction. No more dragging through the family courts for years. (Government often says over 80% of parents don't resort to the courts \u2013 but that still leaves a significant proportion who do. It also fails to gauge the number of non-resident parents who surrender early in the belief that to fight for access to a child will prove pointless.)</p> <p>The early interventions project would have provided a new template that genuinely did put the interests of children first. It had the support of senior judges, including England's then senior family judge, <a href=\"http://www.bihr.co.uk/documents/paul-sieghart-lectures/are-we-failing-the-family-human-rights-children-and-the-meaning-of-\">Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss</a>.</p> <p>She has referred to the misery of children who are told nothing; may blame themselves for their parents' split and who don't know when or whether they will see the non-resident parent again. </p> <p>The early interventions project was almost immediately scuppered by civil servants. The wishy-washy family resolutions project that took its place was an abysmal flop as a <a href=\"http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/research/data/uploadfiles/RR720.pdf\">pilot (pdf)</a>. </p> <p>Since then, the government has announced a variety of measures, for instance, more investment in conciliation. In practise, however, the system continues to be a mess.</p> <p>A few years ago, the appeal court judge, Lord Justice Wall, said in a judgment:</p> <blockquote> <p>The court system for dealing with contact disputes has serious faults. It tends to entrench parental attitudes rather than encouraging them to change. It is ill-adapted to deal with the difficult human dilemmas involved, notably when it to the enforcement of its order.</p> </blockquote> <p>The UK system's lack of desire to demand change in parental attitudes is precisely why it fails. In the UK, the belief is strong that every non-resident father is a man on the run from his family obligations. Fathers are changing \u2013 but are territorial mothers?</p> <p>Apart from a few projects and the work of the Centre for Separated Families based in York, little is on offer in the UK that reinforces the importance to children of two parents after a family divides. </p> <p>At present, for instance, child benefit and tax credits automatically go to the person the law calls the \"parent with care\". A non-resident father may have a child three days a week, he may be on benefit, but he receives little help. For the sake of the child, that ought to change.</p> <p>Family services ought to be more \"father-friendly\". Above all, the system has to operate on the assumption that the non-resident parent wants to continue to be part of his or her child's life.</p> <p>It shouldn't be that difficult to achieve this shift. But it is. Later this month, a group of agony aunts, led by The Sun's Deirdre Sanders, are having a joint meeting with politicians Ed Balls and Michael Gove, to push for change. </p> <p>Happy times for children can and do happen even after a parent moves out. What makes the difference is grown up behaviour and a system that believes that non-resident dads (and it's still more often dads) can and do matter.</p>",

  "<p>How do you organise a successful revolution? And, given the present political climate, why don't we let the managers of Ikea run the country instead of the politicians?</p> <p>If you want to study humanities at Oxbridge, these are the sorts of left-field questions you may be asked in your interview.</p> <p>Today is the application deadline for Oxford and Cambridge, and applicants must be prepared for the unexpected when the interview process kicks off in mid-December.</p> <p>Admissions tutors at the two leading universities are looking for more than straight A grades at A-level, and their apparently eccentric questions are designed to identify intellectual potential. </p> <p>Mike Nicholson, director of undergraduate admissions at Oxford University, said: \"Interviewing provides us with information to assist us in differentiating between very strongly qualified candidates. </p> <p>\"The interview focuses on academic content and questions relevant to the subject, but it isn't a test to see what students have learned and can regurgitate. Rather, it is an opportunity to assess how they think and respond to subject-specific questions, applying their understanding of concepts and principles to unfamiliar material or situations.\"</p> <p>Nicholson denied that the questions were designed to catch out or embarrass candidates. </p> <p>He said: \"Often the questions people quote are taken out of context (asking about the shape and colour of a banana, for example, is a perfectly sensible question in the context of a biology interview if the preceding three questions have been around how fruits and plants reproduce and pollinate) and many of the stories are apocryphal (a story about people being thrown a rugby ball was current when I was applying to university in the late 1980s).\"</p> <p>He said that students with the right mix of qualifications and enthusiasm had a good chance of succeeding - although Oxford conducted 24,000 interviews last year and offered around 3,200 places.</p> <p>But for candidates with deep pockets who would like a little extra help with the interview, independent education consultancies such as Oxbridge Applications offer interview preparation days and weekends. </p> <p>Oxbridge Applications runs a three-day residential course in Oxford at the end of the month. It costs \u00a3950 - although pupils on Education Maintenance Allowances can attend a one-day course for free.</p> <p>The firm's managing director, Chloe Palfreman, said: \"We aim to give students the confidence to view the eccentric questions they may be asked as a great opportunity to display their powers of lateral thinking and show that their subject study has gone well beyond the A-level syllabus.\"</p> <p>The majority of the Oxbridge Applications' clients (68%) come from the state sector, says Palfreman, who won a place to Oxford from a Hull comprehensive.

  "<p>Gordon Brown today said he was \"very angry\" with the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/14/terrorism-uksecurity1\">House of Lords after it threw out his plans to detain terrorism suspects without charge for up to 42 days</a>, forcing the government to abandon its proposal.</p> <p>\"I am very angry at the House of Lords,\" the prime minister said at the EU summit in Brussels. \"They should not have rejected the proposals we had for pre-charge detention, which in very special circumstances would go up to 42 days. They defied the will of the House of Commons which was expressed in favour of those.\"</p> <p>Brown appeared in the Commons on Monday night when Jacqui Smith, the home secretary, delivered an emergency statement on the counter-terrorism bill a few hours after peers overwhelmingly rejected the 42-day proposal.</p> <p>Smith announced that she would not seek to overturn the peers' vote but would instead publish a new bill containing the measure, to be introduced to parliament if there is a terrorist emergency.</p> <p>The prime minister said today: \"That is a bill that we would ask the House of Commons and Lords to take through within a few hours so that we can deal with the emergency that would exist. The [counter-terrorism] bill was always about how we prepare ourselves in advance of a terrorist emergency. The legislation could not be triggered until there was that emergency. </p> <p>\"What we are really proposing now is that we will take that bill immediately there is an emergency and therefore no time would be lost in dealing with the terrorist problem if that terrorist problem exists.\"</p> <p>Brown's remarks showed his fury after peers rejected 42 days by a majority of 191 votes.

  "<p>Kenneth Branagh, currently playing the leading role in Ivanov in the Donmar's residency at the Wyndham's theatre, has withdrawn from directing Jude Law in the season's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/shakespeare\">Hamlet</a> next year. Branagh is reportedly tied up with his directing commitments on the Hollywood superhero blockbuster Thor. Michael Grandage, who directed Ivanov, will now take over directing duties on Hamlet, the fourth and final play in the Donmar's season at Wyndham's. Branagh will remain involved as the season's artistic associate.</p> <p>Grandage says he is \"thrilled and flattered to have the opportunity to direct Jude Law - one of the leading actors of his generation as he takes on one of the most important roles of his career\". Law is \"privileged\" to be directed by Grandage and he enthused about the \"support and guidance\" of Branagh, who he dubbed \"one of the greatest Hamlets of all time\".</p> <p>The Donmar's season at Wyndham's offers punters tickets at Donmar prices and a West End venue that is three times bigger than the Covent Garden theatre. The season enjoyed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/sep/18/theatre.chekhov\">a triumphant opening with Ivanov</a>, which received rapturous reviews from critics. Grandage is also the director of the other plays in the season, which continues with the December opening of Twelfth Night, starring Derek Jacobi as Malvolio, and Yukio Mishima's Madame De Sade, starring Judi Dench and Rosamund Pike, which opens in March 2009. The Jude Law Hamlet, which enjoyed the lion's share of attention when the season was announced, rounds off the high-profile season and opens for previews on May 29 2009.<br> The news has a knock-on effect for the National Theatre, which planned to stage a production of Georg Buchner's French Revolution drama Danton's Death, directed by Grandage, next year. A spokesperson for the National said that Danton's Death will now be delayed and that it is hoped Grandage will still direct. The movie Thor, meanwhile, continues a busy Hollywood spell for Branagh, who directed Jude Law in a remake of Sleuth in 2007 and will soon be seen opposite Tom Cruise in Valkyrie.</p>",

  "<p>As the old adage goes: if you want something doing right, do it yourself. It's a mantra that Marvel comics might have had in mind when it finally formed its own <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film\">film</a> studio in 2004. But despite the success of this summer's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/123770/iron.man\">Iron Man</a>, the jury's still out over whether the move has been an outright victory. </p> <p>Lest we forget, Louis Leterrier's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/124582/incredible.hulk\">The Incredible Hulk</a>, which hit cinemas a few weeks before its sibling, didn't really succeed in its goal of rebooting a franchise that should be up there with DC's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/113258/superman.returns\">Superman</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/122806/dark.knight\">Batman</a>. At the very least, Leterrier's film needed to do better than the previous attempt to bring the not-so-jolly green giant to the big screen: Ang Lee's 2003 effort <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/92157/hulk\">Hulk</a>. But in the end, the two movies finished with almost identical box office hauls and similarly mixed reviews.<br> Furthermore, Leterrier's Bruce Banner, Ed Norton, seems uninterested in pursuing the franchise any further, even if Marvel wanted him to (<a href=\"http://www.superherohype.com/news/hulknews.php?id=7665&amp;offset=225\">which they apparently don't</a>). All of which raises the possibility that yet another reboot might be necessary to produce the sort of film the character deserves. And frankly if I have to watch one more Hulk movie featuring almost exactly the same characters and plotline as the last one I'll start ripping my own bloody trousers with rage.</p> <p>Not to be put off, however, Marvel is moving ahead with a second Iron Man feature, plus individual films about Thor, Captain America and Ant Man. And then there's the plan to bring the characters together for an Avengers movie. </p> <p>One of the advantages of running your own film studio is that it allows you to cross-pollinate characters from different movies, just as Marvel does so successfully in its comic books. The Incredible Hulk featured a cameo from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/robertdowneyjr\">Robert Downey Jr</a>'s Tony Stark, aka Iron Man, in which he talked about \"putting a team together\" - a clear reference to The Avengers. And reports suggest that the upcoming DVD release of Leterrier's film <a href=\"http://www.firstshowing.net/2008/10/11/captain-america-officially-found-in-the-incredible-hulk/\">reintroduces the deleted scene in which Captain America makes an appearance</a>, albeit frozen in the Arctic ice.</p> <p>Could the Hulk also appear in The Avengers? Iron Man writers Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby, who have been inexplicably replaced by Justin Theroux for the forthcoming sequel, reckon that would make the most sense, and it would certainly get Marvel out of a pretty deep hole concerning what to do with their flagship character: yup, make him the villain.</p> <p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1228705/\">Iron Man 2</a> is starting to take shape, with news that <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3ibc7ed676383467c2ef5b0b84b924a87b\">Don Cheadle is to replace Terrence Howard as Colonel James Rhodes</a> in the sequel. Apparently Howard stepped aside over financial issues. Given the first film's hint that Rhodes could be wearing his own flying suit in future, one wonders if Howard balked at accepting substandard pay for a film in which he might play a far more important role: in the comic books, Rhodes becomes a superhero in his own right, War Machine, and even assumes the mantle of Iron Man for a time following Stark's lapse into alcoholism.</p> <p>At least Marvel has managed to hire some fanboy-friendly talent to look after its roster: <a href=\"http://www.getthebigpicture.net/blog/2008/7/23/ant-man-taking-a-holiday.html\">Ant Man</a>, for one, is being penned by the brilliantly unlikely pairing of Shaun of the Dead's Edgar Wright, who's also directing, and Joe Cornish of comedy duo Adam and Joe. The same cannot be said for the Terminator franchise, which has managed to hire the hugely unpopular McG, a man best known for bringing the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/86572/charlie.s.angels\">Charlie's Angels</a> franchise to the big screen, to direct its own reboot, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0438488/\">Terminator Salvation</a>. </p> <p>Reaction from message board users and the king geeks over at Aint It Cool News has been <a href=\"http://mmuk64.proboards42.com/index.cgi?action=display&amp;board=Movie&amp;thread=3583&amp;page=1#44427\">almost universally negative</a>, but <a href=\"http://www.totalfilm.com/news/terminator-salvation-images-online\">these leaked snaps from the shoot</a> have been thawing attitudes. Although the series has featured some of the best CGI to grace the big screen, in the shape of Robert Patrick's metal-morphing T-1000 in Terminator 2: Judgment Day, fans seem pleased that McG is using real sets, rather than relying on computer-generated backgrounds. The addition of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/christianbale\">Christian Bale</a>, hugely popular after The Dark Knight, should also help.</p> <p>One movie that isn't struggling to build excitement is Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes. With Robert Downey Jr as Holmes, Jude Law as Watson and Guy Ritchie in the hot seat, the paparazzi have been out in force, resulting in <a href=\"http://justjared.buzznet.com/2008/10/10/robert-downey-jr-as-sherlock-holmes-first-pictures/\">these rather strange shots of Downey Jr over the weekend</a>. Yesterday it was <a href=\"http://justjared.buzznet.com/2008/10/12/dr-watson-jude-law/\">Law's turn to be in the spotlight</a>, and today there are <a href=\"http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=photoGalleryAlbum&amp;galleryid=2059\">yet more snaps of Downey Jr</a>, this time looking a lot more like Holmes.</p> <p>Despite garnering an Oscar nomination <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103939/\">the last time he played an Englishman</a>, some are already voicing their concern that Downey Jr's received pronunciation might not be good enough to play Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's great detective, although Ritchie says he is more than satisfied with his leading actor's accent. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2008/oct/13/robert-downey-jr-sherlock-holmes?commentid=75bfdde4-da85-46a9-a5f9-9a4bcbcceec1\">But as one wag pointed out</a> in the comments section of my recent blog post, the film-maker probably thinks Madonna sounds normal.</p>",
  "<p>Tens of thousands of police stood guard over cash machines across Japan today to prevent what was expected to be a lucrative day for con-artists who prey on the country's 40 million pensioners.</p> <p>Police are stepping up efforts to crack down on ruses targeting vulnerable retirees, who between them receive 6.5 trillion yen (\u00a337bn) in pension payments on the 15th of every other month.</p> <p>About 56,000 officers were stationed at 81,000 cashpoints, around 80% of the country's total, in the biggest police operation since the G8 leaders met in northern Japan in July.</p> <p>Typically, the hoaxers telephone elderly people and open the conversation with a confident, \"Hi, it's me,\" sometimes coaxing their targets into revealing the name of a son or daughter by playfully asking them to guess who's calling.</p> <p>The more vulnerable members of Japan's huge elderly population are proving easy pickings for ingenious con-artists.</p> <p>A favourite ruse is to claim that the caller has been involved in a car accident and needs to transfer cash to the other party immediately.

In one of the worst recorded cases, an elderly victim wired 22 million yen.</p> <p>Widespread media coverage of the \"It's me\" scam has forced fraudsters to resort to other measures.</p> <p>There has been an alarming rise in calls from people claiming to be tax or social insurance office officials, promising their prey refunds on previous payments in exchange for a handling fee.</p> <p>In some cases the callers pose as police officers or lawyers, claiming that the victim's son has been caught groping a woman on a train, but agreeing to drop the case in exchange for cash.</p> <p>In others the victims are told their siblings desperately need cash to pay loan sharks or for a girlfriend's abortion.</p> <p>Last year conmen tricked their victims, mostly pensioners, into transferring more than 25 billion yen, according to police, who believe the total for this year will be even higher.</p> <p>Between January and August victims had already been swindled out of 21.4 billion yen - up 42% from the same period last year - with 346 arrests.</p> <p>NHK, Japan's public broadcaster, reported that today's police presence had prevented at least one person, a 66-year-old woman, from being duped.

  "<p>If the name Rafael Lozano-Hemmer doesn't mean anything to you now, it will come November. The fastest rising art star is set to create one of the most spellbinding installations yet in Trafalgar Square. Called Under Scan, the giant video work features a cast of silhouettes who jump up and dance as your shadow passes across their periphery. </p> <p>Born in 1967, the Mexican-born, Canadian-based <a href=\"http://www.lozano-hemmer.com/\">Lozano-Hemmer</a> is often described as an electronic artist (a name he loathes, preferring to describe his maverick works as \"anti-monuments for alien agency\"). Using robotics, projections, internet links, mobile phone interfaces and ultrasonic sensors, he builds complex constructions that screw with the system. Like mad professors, Lozano-Hemmer and his seven assistants build doppelgangers and conjure ghosts that haunt his eager public. </p> <p>Yet there is more than spectacle to the artist's creations. In a world of advance surveillance systems that continuously track our every move, Lozano-Hemmer's digital marvels are retaliation against all that prying.</p> <p>His current exhibition at The Curve, Barbican, uses the audience's bodies to tune into different radio frequencies, cutting from air traffic control to the police to Magic FM in the space of a slouch. A self-confessed nerd, it is not surprising that Lozano-Hemmer trained in physical chemistry rather than art, and it has only been in the past four years that museums have started collecting his work. From his early installation Surface Tension, in which a giant eye followed viewers round a room, to the recent Subtitled Public in which audiences were tracked by infrared devices, Lozano-Hemmer is like an anarchic whistle-blower exposing the sophisticated devices used to control us.<br>  <strong>Corporate speak:</strong> When asked about the conglomerates that he often needs to bank roll his big budget productions he modestly declared, \"We have a saying in Mexico: 'to bite your poncho'.

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/oct/15/11\">A recording of the emergency call</a> made by teenager Hannah Foster on the night she was kidnapped and murdered was played in court today during the trial of the man accused of killing her. </p> <p>Seventeen-year-old Hannah's body was found dumped at a roadside in Allington Lane, West End, near Southampton, on March 16 2003, two days after she was abducted. She had been raped and strangled.</p> <p>Maninder Pal Singh Kohli, 40, a sandwich delivery van driver, is accused of her murder, rape, kidnapping and false imprisonment. He denies all the charges.</p> <p>Today, the jury at Winchester crown court heard a 50-second recording of the call the teenager made secretly after she was abducted. </p> <p>The background conversation can be heard in the enhanced recording. The prosecution has alleged the male voice in it is Kohli's.</p> <p>The voice can be heard asking: \"You belong this country?\" Hannah replies that she does and she is English. She can be heard telling him that her name is Sarah, which is the name of her younger sister, and that she is 15.</p> <p>After some inaudible conversation, she tells the man: \"That's my, my road ... that was where I live.\"</p> <p>Shortly afterwards, the male voice is heard to say: \"Held (unclear) your head down please.\" \"Sorry ... no\" she replies.</p> <p>Throughout the conversation, the operator is asking which service Hannah wants. The line goes to an automated message because Hannah is not directly speaking into the phone, and the call is then disconnected.</p> <p>A statement given to the court by Hannah's mother, Hilary, today provided a detailed account of the hours before the teenager disappeared. </p> <p>Foster, a 51-year-old cardiac nurse, said she got up at 5am on Saturday to go to work and noticed Hannah's bedroom door was open and the landing lights were on.</p> <p>\"If Hannah decided to stay overnight with a girlfriend, she would always let me know by text,\" she said.</p> <p>At 6.30am, she phoned her daughter's mobile but there was no reply. She continued to try her daughter's phone several times during the day while she was at work, but it always went to voicemail. Hannah's father reported their daughter missing to the police four hours later. </p> <p>In earlier evidence, a friend of Hannah who is thought to be the last person to have seen her alive told the court of the evening they spent together before she disappeared.</p> <p>Helen Wilkinson, 23, a PhD student, said she stayed the night at Hannah's home in Southampton and they met after college and decided to go out to pubs in Portswood. They left to go home around 10.30pm.</p> <p>The jury was shown CCTV footage of the two women walking past a NatWest bank at 10.43pm on March 14. Wilkinson told the court the pair stopped in Portswood Road where they waited for a few minutes until the bus Hannah was going to take came up the road.</p> <p>\"The bus came, we saw it at a distance, and Hannah decided to start off because she said the bus was coming and she started to walk,\" she said.</p> <p>Nicholas Haggan QC, prosecuting, asked: \"As the bus moved away down Portswood Road, did you see Hannah?\" Wilkinson replied: \"She was walking down Highfield Lane, and she turned and waved. I waved.\"</p> <p>Haggan asked: \"Did she wave back?\" Wiping away tears, Wilkinson replied: \"Yes.\"</p> <p>Police analysed Hannah's mobile phone data and pinpointed Kohli's van moving along motorways linking Southampton and Portsmouth on the night she disappeared, the jury was told yesterday.</p> <p>Kohli fled the UK to India but was arrested by Indian authorities in 2004 and extradited to the UK in 2007.</p> <p>The trial continues.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/alexsalmond\">Alex Salmond</a> has challenged Gordon Brown to a \"toe-to-toe\" debate about the economy and the rising cost of living after the prime minister confirmed he plans to campaign in the Glenrothes byelection.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/snp\">Scottish National party</a> leader formally launched his party's byelection campaign in the Fife constituency this morning and called on the UK government to spend several billion pounds tackling fuel poverty this winter.</p> <p>The Scottish first minister said the SNP would make soaring living costs and the economy a key plank of its campaign to win the Westminster seat by overturning a 10,664 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour\">Labour</a> majority, inflicting its second byelection defeat on the government this year.</p> <p>\"This is a winter byelection, and that will concentrate minds wonderfully in this campaign,\" he said. \"I detect that the political earth is still shaking from Glasgow East and it's going to be felt next here in Glenrothes.\"</p> <p>Salmond knows the prime minister is highly unlikely to stage a debate \u2013 Labour insists the byelection should be fought by the candidates, not party leaders.</p> <p>But Salmond today tried to turn the campaign into a popularity contest between his government and the Labour government in London \u2013 a tactic he successfully used in the last week of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/glasgoweast\">Glasgow East byelection</a>.</p> <p>It emerged last night that Brown has written personally to all Labour MPs and peers \"urging\" them all to visit the constituency and support the party's battle to hold the seat.</p> <p>The prime minister said both he and his wife Sarah expected to do so, \"subject to the global financial situation\". Her unexpected appearance to introduce Brown's speech to the Labour conference last month helped bolster his leadership.</p> <p>In a measure of the byelection's significance to Brown \u2013 the seat borders his constituency of <a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/hoc/constituency/0,,-1059,00.html\">Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath</a> - the party's whips had been instructed to help every MP and peer join the campaign, either in person or by phoning voters.</p> <p>Labour believes the prime minister's success in tackling the global financial crisis has transformed the party's fortunes. Last night, Brown claimed in a BBC Scotland interview that the scale of the banking crisis completely undermined the SNP's case that an independent Scotland could prosper.</p> <p>Salmond claimed Brown's \u00a350bn financial rescue package would fail to combat rising unemployment, the latest jump in inflation or the sharply increasing cost of living.</p> <p>The first minister pledged to match the dozen visits he made during the three weeks of the Glasgow East byelection, urging voters to support the SNP. \"Battle will be joined and the issue will be toe-to-toe,\" Salmond said, adding later: \"I would be delighted to debate with the prime minister anywhere in this seat.\"</p> <p>David Cameron, the Conservative leader, has already challenged Brown to campaign in Glenrothes, claiming two months ago the prime minister was scared to visit in person.</p> <p>The nationalists hope that Brown's appearances in Glenrothes could backfire, since they anticipate he will only attend staged events with invited guests, to avoid unscripted meetings with voters and for security reasons.</p> <p>A Labour spokesman said: \"This is a typical SNP stunt. Alex Salmond seems to be planning to spend more time in Glenrothes than actually running the country, like in Glasgow East, when he gave up running Scotland to run their byelection campaign.\"</p> <p>The SNP should instead concentrate on allowing their candidate, local council leader Peter Grant, to debate the issues face-to-face with Labour's candidate, Lindsay Roy, the head teacher at Brown's old secondary school in Kirkcaldy, he added.</p> <p>Salmond called on the government to suspend the 5% VAT paid on domestic energy this winter, at a cost of \u00a31.5bn across the UK; increase winter fuel relief to pensioners by another \u00a3100 on top of the \u00a350 or \u00a3100 increases already announced by ministers; and cut VAT on all home energy efficiency measures to 5%.</p> <p>The party said the extra fuel relief for Scottish pensioners would cost \u00a368m in Scotland, and later said it would cost \u00a3620m across the UK. The current reduction in VAT by ministers for some energy efficiency measure to 5% had failed to cover labour costs and some materials, so was insufficient, it added. </p> <p>\"We're saying it's time for a fair deal on energy prices in this constituency, where average fuel bills are now \u00a31,400 per family, with bill increases of 40% have thudded through letter boxes in the last few years,\" Salmond said. </p> <p>A Downing Street source dismissed Salmond's challenge. \"Alex Salmond's economic illiteracy is becoming more apparent and more embarrassing for Scotland every day. The prime minister is spending every moment he can combating the global economic crisis, trying to ensure that people's jobs are secure, bank deposits are secure and mortgages are secure, and to draw down food and fuel prices.</p> <p>\"While he's doing that, Alex Salmond can try to convince the people of Scotland to become like Iceland.\"</p> <p>The byelection will be held on November 6, following the death in August of the Labour MP John MacDougall, the former council leader and close ally of Brown's, who held Glenrothes for seven years.</p> <p>Although Brown's fortunes have changed markedly after Labour conference thanks to his handling of the global financial crisis, the byelection could yet be crucial to his future as Labour leader. </p> <p>The SNP are favourites to win the seat, partly since opinion polls suggest the SNP has its first ever lead over Labour in a UK general election, although senior party figures admit it will now be a far tougher campaign and are trying to dampen predictions they are expecting to win.</p> <p>The nationalists hold the equivalent Scottish parliament seat, control the council in coalition with the Liberal Democrats, and have been quietly campaigning in Glenrothes since MacDougall's terminal illness become public.</p> <p>However, Labour sources insist their vote is solid, and growing, with Tory supporters switching to stop the SNP winning the seat. Jim Murphy, the new Scottish secretary, has said Brown was a tremendous asset for the party in Fife and commanded significant local respect and loyalty.</p> <p>Full list of candidates declared so far:</p> <p><strong>Labour:</strong> Lindsay Roy</p> <p><strong>Scottish National party:</strong> Peter Grant</p> <p><strong>Liberal Democrats:</strong> Harry Wills</p> <p><strong>Conservatives:</strong> Maurice Golden</p> <p><strong>Scottish Socialist party:</strong> Morag Balfour</p> <p><strong>Solidarity:</strong> Louise McLeary</p> <p><strong>UK Independence party:</strong> Kris Seunarine</p>",
  "<p>A young boy saw a hooded gunman on a bicycle fire the shots that killed schoolboy Rhys Jones in a pub car park, Liverpool crown court heard today. </p> <p>The 11-year-old, who cannot be identified, was giving evidence in the trial of Sean Mercer, 18, who is accused of the murder of Rhys. </p> <p>The jury heard a taped interview with the young witness, who was sitting with his family outside the Fir Tree pub in Croxteth on August 22 last year, the night Rhys was killed. </p> <p>The witness recalled seeing someone \"pointing a gun at something\". He said: \"I carried on talking and then I heard a big loud bang. Then there was a pause and then there were another two shots from the lad.\" </p> <p>The boy said he watched the gunman for about three to five seconds until he cycled away down an alleyway. The youngster was unable to see the gunman's face but said they were dressed in a black jacket and tracksuit bottoms with a black hood over their head. </p> <p>After the shooting, the boy went inside the pub while his father went to where Rhys was lying surrounded by other onlookers. </p> <p>The prosecution claims Mercer fired the three shots across the car park after targeting members of a rival gang who had strayed on to his turf. </p> <p>The second bullet, the jury has been told, struck 11-year-old Rhys in the neck.

  "<p>There's an old saying that circulates in more politically radical circles: \"Protest is patriotism.\" In this post-September 11 world of paranoia and political expediency, however, protest, an essence of democracy, has morphed into something perfectly Orwellian: terrorism.</p> <p>Two recent events demonstrate how easy it is for the government to dilute words and their meanings to close off opposition and dissent. Last week, the Maryland state police <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/07/AR2008100703245_pf.html\">disclosed that 53 nonviolent anti-war and anti-death penalty activists were tracked</a> for 14 months in 2005 and 2006 under the state's terrorism surveillance programme, and that their names had been added to the state's and the National Security Agency's database. <br> Who are these sinister terrorists? Two of the activists caught in the Maryland dragnet are Carol Gilbert and Ardeth Platte, Dominican nuns in the Roman Catholic Church who did indeed break the law in acts of civil disobedience. On October 2, 2002, in response to the first anniversary of the war in Afghanistan, they broke into a missile silo in northeastern Colorado and painted bloody crosses on it.</p> <p>Understanding that acts of civil disobedience carry grave consequences, Gilbert and Platte paid a hefty price for their protest: they went to prison. Gilbert received 30 months in a federal penitentiary while Platte was sentenced to 41 months for injuring government property and obstructing national defence. The nuns no doubt agree with Thoreau's famous saying: \"Under a government which imprisons unjustly, the true place for a just man is also a prison.\"</p> <p>But being labelled terrorists is too much for them. They say they protest in pursuit of peace and truth. \"We're Dominicans. Our mission is 'veritas', which is truth,\" <a href=\"http://www.washtimes.com/news/2008/oct/10/protesting-nuns-branded-terrorists/\">Gilbert told the Washington Times</a>. They aren't even sure how their names were included in the Maryland state police's database, since they say they weren't involved with the protests the state police say they monitored. The surveillance programme has been shut down, and police superintendent Terrence Sheridan admitted to the Maryland Senate last week that \"The names don't belong in there. It's as simple as that.\" The activists have been notified that they can review their files before they are purged from the databases.</p> <p>Farther to the north, another state is experimenting with a far more audacious assault on democracy. In 2002, <a href=\"http://www.dglobe.com/articles/index.cfm?id=15159&amp;section=news&amp;freebie_check&amp;CFID=102273959&amp;CFTOKEN=48519037&amp;jsessionid=8830f37d7f50f211b3ac\">Minnesota liberalised the legal definition of terrorism</a>, according to the Associated Press, to include actions \"intended to interfere with the conduct of government or the right of lawful assembly.\" Essentially, it's Minnesota's version of the US Patriot Act. </p> <p>Ramsey county police used the statute to break up an anarchist group called the RNC Welcoming Committee that planned to carry out direct action protests, including roadblocks, to prevent delegates to the Republican national convention from entering the Xcel Center in Minneapolis. Eight leaders of the organisation were arrested before a protest was even launched. They face seven and a half years in prison if convicted.</p> <p>No doubt these actions are crimes, but as Stephen Vladeck, associate professor at American University Washington College of Law, told the AP: \"One of the biggest concerns among scholars who debate the definition of terrorism is that an overbroad definition would both dilute the real sense of terrorism and punish conduct that has traditionally been a far more minor offence.\"</p> <p>What's frightening about these recent incidents is twofold. First, the Maryland police programme raises the question of how extensive this devolution of surveillance from the federal government to individual states has become. We already have the <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/doc/20011217/cole\">national security state</a>. Must Americans worry that state and municipal governments will also increasingly monitor peaceful people who participate in political activities?</p> <p>Second, the terrorism charges brought against activists like Gilbert and Platte and the members of the RNC Welcoming Committee have, in effect, criminalised protest. This is all the more serious because Minnesota had the audacity to not only revise the terrorism statutes to hamper acts of civil disobedience but also to bring such draconian charges against the group's members before they even committed a criminal act. Seven and a half years for planning to block entrance to the Xcel Center, spray police and delegates with urine and even spread marbles on the ground a la Animal House is excessive and ridiculous. <br> Again, there's no doubt that these actions would get the protesters arrested, possibly even charged in earlier times with a felony, but to suggest this is terrorism says much about our society. Those in charge will not tolerate a vibrant culture of dissent - a novel irony in such an overwhelmingly Christian country whose saviour found himself on a cross for his civil disobedience in the temple. </p> <p>The group's activists have no illusions about what Ramsey county is up to. \"Conspiracy charges serve a very particular purpose - to criminalise dissent,\" <a href=\"http://www.nornc.org/2008/10/05/letter-from-the-rnc-8/\">the RNC Eight wrote to their supporters</a>. \"They create a convenient method for incapacitating activists, with the potential for diverting limited resources toward protracted legal battles and terrorising entire communities into silence and inaction.\"</p> <p>It's startling to think that in the US we even have the pretension to argue about the merits of exporting democracy when such blatant authoritarianism continues to run rampant here at home.</p>",

At the top of Kelvingrove Park, near the University, sit two Tudor-style cottages, built for the 1901 Glasgow Exhibition. They were built by the Lever Brothers (of Persil and Fairy, and Sunlight Soap fame), as an exact replica of the houses that make up Port Sunlight village, the town built for their workers, complete with cinema, art gallery and railway station, near Liverpool.</p> <p>The Glasgow houses (Port Sunlight Cottage) were intended to be an example of how houses in Glasgow would be built from then on, but this never happened, and now they stand alone, looking quite out of place amongst the sandstone of the city. They are now private residences.</p> <p>It's a beautiful walk up through the park to get to the houses, and it leaves you within easy reach of the Transport Museum, the Kelvingrove museum and art gallery, and the West End.</p> <p>You can see more at <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/3dap2j\">tinyurl.com/3dap2j</a>.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Just outside Glasgow University, G12, at the top of Kelvingrove Park.

Here, Glasgow's answers to Del boy and Rodney make their southern cousins look like shy introverts, as they sell anything from fur coats to football strips and computers to car parts.</p> <p>The market has expanded from its humble beginnings to include hundreds of stalls and shops selling everything and anything. Barras are rented out on a daily basis, meaning an ever-changing stock and providing an ad-hoc sales channel for anyone with stuff to shift.</p> <p>Never one to miss a trick, the Barras has evolved with the times, reflecting the changing needs of a varied clientele. Nowadays, Maggie's original fruit barra has evolved into a farmers' market, which takes place on the last Saturday in every month from 8am (but get there quick, because stock sells out by lunchtime), and the modern market does a roaring trade in computer software of perhaps dubious origin. Never mind, it's all yours for a tenner.</p> <p>The Barras was there long before Versace and the Italian Centre, and despite constant raids from overworked and frankly exasperated trading standards officials, it will still be there a long time after they're gone too.

  "<p>I've fallen for my colleague. It's not a visual appreciation from a distance, as with a Mark Rothko painting. It's not even physical attraction, like the office girls in the Coca Cola adverts. This guy has a bit of a beer belly. He's stubbly and northern and looks a bit like Aragon - a couple of decades after saving the ring. But I'm tongue-tied whenever he speaks to me, and it's rather a problem. Especially since he's slightly senior and we have daily conferences. </p> <p>People often ask me if it's OK to date a colleague. Most schoolchildren have 'dated' within the playground railings. And at university, you'd be an outsider if you didn't dabble in a little halls of residence incest. But if Bill Clinton and Bridget Jones have taught us only one thing, it's that relationships in the workplace never end sweetly. Even if the lover is as charming as Hugh Grant or as, er, attractive as Lewinsky. </p> <p>The Colleague has as much charm as a mackerel. He's a bit rough in his humour, smokes like a chimney, and oddly he follows fashion week - presumably for the female models. So I decide to dress like a Burberry Prorsum campaign: pouty and ever-so-cool. I also try to inject a little wit into his days. Last week there was red paint on my newspaper article - it was a printing spillage. He saw it and said, \"What's that?\" I managed to say, \"I coughed on it \u2026 it's, erm, tuberculosis.\" </p> <p>It wasn't quite the desirable model I wanted to portray. This week I decided to transform myself into a cool and irresistible Brigitte Bardot-alike. I'll be damned if I'll chase a colleague, but I can have a stab at making him chase me ... </p> <p>A friend of mine, Social Butterfly, is secretly dating a colleague. She is in a more senior position than him and makes sure she's always in control. \"You can never like him more than he does you\", she instructed. \"And never, ever let your colleagues find out.\" </p> <p>It was working until they went on a karaoke night and he drank one too many beers. He text messaged her in front of their colleague and demanded they go home together. She ignored him. He told her he loved her. So now she's decided to let their relationship peter out.</p> <p>It put me off a bit. But then I was sent out on a job with The Colleague. We took separate cars, and he led the way. He swung around corners, a fag dangling out of the window between his fingertips. When we hit the motorway, his people-carrier hammed up the revs to more than 70mph, even on the slip road. I slugged behind in a Peugeot 205. By the time he hit 90mph, my accelerator was touching the floor. Somehow, I stayed on his tail. My palms were sweaty but I was determined to match Charlize Theron in the Italian job remake. </p> <p>We didn't crash, thank God, and the job went well enough. After he left, I drank a glass of champagne and felt quietly proud of myself - until I went outside. I was on an industrial estate. There were 12 different car parks. And I didn't have the faintest idea where my Peugeot 205 was. I had no choice. I dialled The Colleague's number. As coolly as I could, I said: \"I seem to have lost the car \u2026\"</p>",

  "<p>Three men accused of involvement in the murder of the Russian journalist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/anna-politkovskaya\">Anna Politkovskaya</a> went on trial in Moscow today, a day after the lawyer representing her family complained of feeling sick after a suspicious substance was found in her car.</p> <p>Politkovskaya, a Kremlin critic, was shot dead two years ago outside her Moscow apartment block. Two Chechen brothers, Dzhabrail and Ibragim Makhmudov, are charged with carrying out surveillance on Politkovskaya, while a former officer, Sergei Khadzhikurbanov, is charged with giving technical help.</p> <p>But today's trial was overshadowed by the suspected poisoning of Karrina Moskalenko, a prominent human rights lawyer representing Politkovskaya's son and daughter. Moskalenko, whose clients have included leading Kremlin opponents, said yesterday that she had discovered mercury in her car.</p> <p>The incident prevented her from travelling from her home in Strasbourg to Moscow in time for today's trial, she said. Speaking to the liberal Moscow radio station Ekho Moskvy, Moskalenko said she suspected the mercury may have been an ominous warning.</p> <p>\"People do not put mercury in your car to improve your health. I am very concerned because there were children in that car,\" Moskaleno told the radio station. \"I think it may have been a demonstration because there was lots of it.\"</p> <p>Today Maskaleno's assistant, Valetin Moiseev, told the Guardian that the lawyer was awaiting the results of toxicology tests from a Strasbourg clinic. She was still feeling \"groggy\", nauseous and giddy, he said, adding: \"She's feeling pretty sick.\" </p> <p>Mercury is an element that occurs naturally, but exposure to high levels can damage the brain, heart, kidneys, lungs and nervous system. Strasbourg police have opened an investigation into Moskaleno's apparent poisoning, saying a \"very large amount\" of mercury had been found under her seat. </p> <p>Today's hearing is the first time that anyone has been brought to trial in connection with Politkovskaya's killing. </p> <p>It follows widespread criticism of the official investigation. So far Russian prosecutors have failed to identify who ordered her murder. They have also been unable to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2008/jul/02/politkovskayakillerineurope\">catch the man they allege did it</a>, a third Makhumdov brother, Rustam. He is said to have fled abroad.</p> <p>This morning's hearing took place behind closed doors at Moscow's district military court. Colleagues from Politkovskaya's newspaper, Novaya Gazeta, failed in an attempt to have the case opened to the public and media.</p> <p>Officials decided on a military rather than a civil trial, claming that much of the material involved is classified. They also say that one of the suspects in a related case is lieutenant colonel Pavel Ryaguzov, an officer in Russia's powerful post-KGB spy agency, the FSB. </p> <p>Politkovskaya, 48, won international acclaim for exposing the brutality of Russian forces and human rights abuses in Chechnya. She died in the lift of her apartment block in a contract-style killing. A CCTV camera captured a man in a white baseball cap entering the building a few moments before she was shot three times in the chest and once in the head.</p> <p>Her murder immediately threw suspicion on Russia's security services and the pro-Moscow Chechen forces that control Chechnya. At the time of her death Politkovskaya had been about to publish an article on torture and kidnappings by pro-government gangs in the southern republic, colleagues said.</p> <p>During her fearless reporting career, Politkovskaya reserved her most vicious criticisms for Ramzan Kadyrov, Chechnya's pro-Moscow president. She described Kadryrov - a former rebel fighter accused of numerous human rights abuses - as a \"coward armed to the teeth and surrounded by bodyguards\". Kadyrov denied having anything to do with her killing. \"I don't kill women,\" he said at the time.</p> <p>Politkovskaya was an outspoken critic of the former president Vladimir Putin, whose rise to power followed the Russian army's second bloody entry into Grozny in late 1999. Putin initially chose to ignore the journalist's murder. Later, however, he described her as a \"rather sharp critic\" of the Kremlin, which, he said, \"is good\".</p> <p><em><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857.

  "<p>Today, as you doubtless know, is <a href=\"http://blogactionday.org/\">Blog Action Day</a>, when the online community is encouraged to turn its attention to a particular issue of global importance. This year the theme chosen is poverty, which seems pretty apt, given the parlous state of the world economy. It also fits nicely with the fact that we are midway towards the 2015 target date for achieving the anti-poverty <a href=\"http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/\">millennium development goals</a>.</p> <p>Yet when I was asked to take part in today's initiative, I was more than a little wary. There's something a bit uncomfortable about calling on everyone to concentrate on an issue for a day and then moving on glibly to the next one. The <a href=\"http://site.blogactionday.org/about/2007-the-environment/\"> environment</a> was last year's theme. Does that mean we sorted it out, then?</p> <p>As I see it, the good thing about blogs and online spaces such as Comment is free is that they offer us, as readers, an opportunity to gain access to a far broader spread of specialists and other informed voices than we would otherwise enjoy. Unless you are prepared to subscribe to a large number of technical publications, at some personal expense, you are unlikely to have access to a fraction of the issues raised in the blogosphere. </p> <p>The hard copy versions of the national newspapers tend to be based around their own columnists and the occasional offerings by high-profile politicians or cultural figures. Their online equivalents, by contrast, offer a far broader range of specialist writers \u2013 for free. Comments back from the wider community offer a further set of perspectives, as well as links through to other sources to compare and contrast.</p> <p>This is particularly important when it comes to today's theme of poverty. Most media outlets have a host of in-house correspondents dedicated to reporting on business, economics and other aspects of wealth creation. Few have a single reporter <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/newswatch/ifs/hi/newsid_3660000/newsid_3660200/3660257.stm\">dedicated</a> to poverty or international development issues. This leads to regular misrepresentation in the media, where political correspondents often fail to apply the usual checks and balances to official statements simply because they do not have the expertise or the interest to spot dodgy claims.</p> <p>Last month's international poverty summit in New York was a case in point. Rather than addressing the underlying <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/25/unitednations.internationalaidanddevelopment\">reasons</a> why the international community is failing to tackle global poverty, those media commentators which covered the summit at all were content to depoliticise it and simply record world leaders' statements of concern and renewed intent. The Guardian's own 16-page <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/alloutonpoverty\">supplement</a> on the summit was actually paid for by the British government, and suitably complimentary of it.</p> <p>Similarly, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/default.stm\"> Newsnight</a> had planned a studio debate on the merits, or otherwise, of the world trade talks as they sought in vain to escape from <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7526043.stm\">crisis</a> this July. In the end they replaced this with a live interview of British trade minister Gareth Thomas, which was a good opportunity to put him on the spot over the government's failure to honour Labour party commitments on trade policy. Yet the interview failed to challenge the government on a single point, and Thomas was allowed to get away scot-free.</p> <p>The problem is symptomatic of a more general trend away from having specialists within the media, as Nick Davies has described in his account of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/feb/04/comment.pressandpublishing\">churnalism</a> that characterises much of today's press coverage. Yet there's also a clear hierarchy that condemns issues such as poverty to a marginal status. Along with correspondents devoted to industrial relations, journalists with a specialist background in international development are an endangered species.</p> <p>The same applies to broadcasting, if not more so. As shown in the International Broadcasting Trust's latest <a href=\"http://www.ibt.org.uk/research.php\">survey</a>, international factual programming on the main four terrestrial channels has now reached its lowest level since the surveys started 20 years ago. Many of the programmes filmed in developing countries are devoted to wildlife, holidays or reality TV shows spiced up through being shot in exotic locations. Politics, development and environmental themes now represent a meagre 7% of all international factual programming on terrestrial TV.</p> <p>This is where the online community comes into its own, as it can turn the political spotlight on such issues and question the establishment line. For this reason alone, today's blogging initiative is welcome. Raising the number of dissenting voices on an issue as important as global poverty can only be a good thing.</p> <p>I do have one problem with blog action day, however. As well as giving time to take part in the blogging, the website encourages people to donate money \u2013 a day's earnings is the suggestion \u2013 to a good cause. As director of a <a href=\"http://www.waronwant.org/Stand20With20Us3A20Donate20Now+14081.twl\">charity</a> that relies on such donations from the public, I have no quarrel with that. </p> <p>Yet the official partner recommended for blog action day is the <a href=\"http://www.theglobalfund.org/EN/\">Global Fund</a> to fight Aids, tuberculosis and malaria. This is one of the <a href=\"http://www.theglobalfund.org/en/funds_raised/pledges/\">richest</a> funds in the world, already supported by governments to the tune of over \u00a36bn to date. Unless your daily earnings are up there with those of Bill Gates, who has given the fund over \u00a3250m, you might like to choose a charity (War on Want or any other) that needs your money more.</p>",

She's 86, a widow, lives alone. \"But who decides how much money there is?\" she asked, as though vexed at every government since Churchill's for failing to enlighten her. \"Isn't it the <a href=\"http://www.royalmint.com/\">Royal Mint</a>? Can't they do anything?\"</p> <p>\"I don't think that's really the problem, Mum,\" I said, blanching at the prospect of explaining what is. I have enough trouble explaining that to myself. \"It all started in America,\" I began. \"The banks lent people money when they shouldn't have. Then, because they did that, well, they didn't have any to lend to each other or other people who needed it, like businesses. And, you know, now it's spread all round the world.\"</p> <p>\"Yes,\" said my mum. \"Isn't it terrible?\"</p> <p>\"It really is,\" I said, gratefully. Having agreed on this we could move on, yet I'd been once again reminded of how poor my understanding of the financial crisis is. </p> <p>Listen, I've really tried. I've striven to achieve at least a basic comprehension of that alternative linguistic universe where terms like \"short-selling\" and \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIBOR\">libor</a>\" have meaning. I've resisted my dunce's urge to fidget or twang my ruler at the back of class while dedicated minds have fought to educate me. Like everyone else I've had my head bent by <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/robertpeston/\">Robert Peston</a>. I've learned a deep respect for men called Nils: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/14/banking-executivesalaries\">Pratley</a> of the Guardian; <a href=\"http://www.gordonpoole.com/?artistID=1175\">Blythe</a> of the BBC. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nils_Lofgren\">Lofgren</a>, lately of the E Street Band, will no doubt be sharing his wisdom with me soon. I am quite pitifully receptive to Paul Krugman's invitation \u2013 discovered via <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/oct/13/krugman-nobel-prize-economics\">Richard Adams</a> \u2013 to <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/id/1916/\">imagine an economy</a> that produces only hot dogs and buns. It's pitiful, but what can I do?</p> <p>Well, actually, there is something. I can spend. The one thing about the credit crunch and its Earth-shaking effects I can make sense of is its self-defeating psychology. Those funny FTSE numbers and the bizarre financial products that have bamboozled even their own inventors may always make my head spin, but the terrifying herd behaviour of \"the markets\", their sudden suspension of belief in their own confidence trick, has a bleak comedy about it I can connect with. And it generates in me its own counter-effect. As Britain resolves to tighten to its belt, I've resolved to do the opposite.</p> <p>I'm not being smug or clever. I'm just translating my tiny sum of economic knowledge into a good excuse for buying some new shoes. Two pairs, actually; and a suit; and an overpriced scarf; and, since I'm being so grown-up and candid with you here, about a grand's worth of goodies for my newly <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/18/wildlife.family\">rat-proofed</a> kitchen. In fact, I bought all these things yesterday during a rare bout of profligacy in London's Oxford Street.</p> <p>I admit to feeling queasy about this: I was brought up to know the value of thrift. But I last bought a pair of shoes three Easters ago (in Padstow, since you ask), I've been using the same set of saucepans since 1982, and I know where my duty lies in this desperate hour of national need.</p> <p>For many people, hard times are on their way. At night, if I stand on a chair in the highest room in my house, twist my neck at a dangerous angle and squint I can lights flashing from the peaks of Canary Wharf. These are not distress signals, although it's easy to imagine that they are. Let's remember that the greatest distress is already being felt not by those laid-off bankers, but by the cleaners and caterers, shopkeepers and shop workers who've so depended on the financial sector's many years of uninhibited success. It is people like them and others who don't make fortunes who are likely to feel the pain of the recession most keenly.</p> <p>Some of us, though, are going to be OK. Our jobs are safe and our personal debts are under control. We are paid good money and those cuts in interest rates are going to make us feel more flush. I'm old enough to remember James Callaghan <a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/politicspast/images/0,,1706432,00.html\">telling</a> the Labour conference of 1976, \"We cannot spend our way out of a recession.\" But that was a long, long time ago. Now is the time for those of us with a few quid in our pockets to part with it, whether in our posh high streets or, perhaps still more importantly, in our neighbourhood mini-markets and cafes. It is time for us to cough up and think of England, to think of Britain and of the world. It is time to go out and buy those shoes.</p>",
  "<p>\"I'm Dawn Porter,\" says Dawn Porter at the beginning of every episode of <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/video/dawn-porter-extreme-wife/catchup.html\">Dawn Porter: Extreme Wife</a>. \"And for the last four years I've been single. It's not that I don't want a relationship. I do. But, before I take the plunge, I plan to experience some of the most extreme ways women find love and live with men.\"</p> <p>You'll already know a lot about Dawn Porter if you've seen her recent slew of BBC3 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/television\">shows</a> including <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/organgrinder/2008/feb/21/watchwithlesbians\">Dawn Goes Lesbian</a> - where she pretended to want to experiment sexually with women but was horrified every time an actual female came near her - and Dawn Goes Naked \u2013 during which she went semi-naked in the name of female empowerment and achieved nothing but wolf whistles. (She seemed quite pleased.)</p> <p>When I say you'll know a lot about her, I mean she manages to pack an awful lot of incredibly superficial information \u2013 \"I'm tired. This is hard. Gosh, I don't know if I'll be able to do this.\" \u2013 into her shows under the guise of investigative journalism. You learn plenty about her current state of mind, but little or nothing about the \"cultural experience\" at hand.</p> <p>In her current Channel 4 series, she tries out different lifestyles for a whole week to see if they're right for her. Or, as she put it in last night's show about <a href=\"http://www.immortalgeisha.com/\">Japanese geisha girls</a>, she wants to see if dedicating her life to serving men could really make her happy.</p> <p>Her favourite things \"in the whole world\" are sushi, sex and karaoke, so she's really delighted to be in Japan. She's soon ensconced in a local spa resort, knocking back the beers with some Japanese businessmen. \"What if someone tries to touch my bottom?\" she giggles to her geisha tutors. Wow, she's really cracking those subjects open like walnuts, isn't she?</p> <p>From there, she heads to the heart of <a href=\"http://www.city.kyoto.jp/koho/eng/\">historic Kyoto</a> to spend a week living in a geisha house, learning their delicate manners and precise ceremonies. After five minutes of her first kneeling lesson, she tells us that it's hard kneeling down for so long and her legs hurt. From then on, she sulks her way through sock-folding (\"I am trying.\"), having her hair done (\"I thought I'd look prettier.\") and going on a rickshaw ride with an unfortunate male client (\"I'm glad that's over,\" she says in hearing distance of the poor sap.)</p> <p>At this point it would have been good to get some historical background, a bit of social history perhaps, any information at all that didn't involve her own discomfort. But no. The one or two cross-examinations she did manage to get were superficial to the point of shaming <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fearne_Cotton\">Fearne Cotton</a>. She conducted one entire interview with a geisha girl while gazing happily at her own reflection in a mirror.</p> <p>Where other interviewers gently ease and tease information from their subjects, Porter is the white noise preventing you from making out anything they might have to say. </p> <p>She comes to the earth-shattering conclusion that the geisha life might NOT be for her. Still, three down, one to go. Perhaps next week's foray into polygamy will be her thing. </p> <p>When did \"authored\" documentary making become so incredibly shallow? I'll concede that not all factual programmes can be fronted by humourless scientists, but it's surely a mistake to think that Porter's insubstantial shoulders can carry anything more than a small handbag, let alone a four-part Channel 4 series on sexual and cultural diversity.</p> <p>Is it just me who feels insulted by this dreadful series?</p>",
  "<p>Did you really think the red-top tabloids would let Gordon Brown get away with reappointing Peter Mandelson to the cabinet without their permission? Among others, it was bound to upset Brown's improbable media ally, Paul Dacre, Daily Mail editor and the Victor Meldrew of Fleet Street. It has. Who says Brown lacks courage?<br><br>The explosion has been delayed by the financial crisis, which is now entering a brief lull. But in today's edition the Mail gives New Labour both barrels. The entire contents of <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1077734/MAX-HASTINGS-The-picture-tells-ghastly-old-socialists-lust-lord-us.html\">Brigadier Max Hastings's dictionary of tabloid outrage</a> (Max is bilingual: he can do broadsheet too) has been conscripted and sent into battle against the business secretary.</p> <p>In case No 10 fails to get the message, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1077720/STEPHEN-GLOVER-The-lie-lays-bare-rank-corruption-Blair-years.html\">Stephen Glover, another bilingual warhorse of the old school, is deployed at similar length</a> a few pages later to pattern-bomb Tony Blair, whom older Mail readers may remember. Both articles are largely fact-free, innuendo-laden invective, but not less enjoyable for that.</p> <p>The ostensible cause of all this outrage is two-fold.</p> <p>First is Mandelson's acceptance, while EU trade commissioner, of hospitality on some Russian aluminium billionaire's naff yacht, the 238ft Queen K, off Corfu last August. At this time (Hastings is a bit vague about the details) the controversial business dealings of the Russian \u2013 currently denied US visa status \u2013 were crossing Mandelson's desk.</p> <p>Much of today's <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1077686/Tories-demand-answers-Lord-Mandys-links-super-rich-Russian-oligarch.html\">accompanying news feature</a> reads as if cloned from the Mail's sister paper, <a href=\"http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23572497-details/Mandelson%2C+the+billionaire+and+a+growing+mystery/article.do\">the London Evening Standard</a>. It does not include the sentence \"there has been no suggestion that Mandelson acted to benefit a friend\", as the loss-making Standard prudently did. It seems unlikely that EU commission policy on aluminium dumping (not the sole controversy) can be resolved over drinks on a crowded yacht, as Brussels officials point out. So what's the issue?</p> <p>Ah yes, it's all a matter of judgment, you see. Was it wise to allow a mere perception of conflict of interest by accepting hospitality? And did he stay overnight, allegedly an overspill guest from Nat Rothschild's nearby villa? And had the new Lord Mandelson of Hartlepool and Foy previously stayed on said gin palace? </p> <p>I don't know about you, but I'm bored already. We all know that some papers have got it in for Mandelson, though I do not share ex-No 10 man <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/oct/13/mandelson-gayrights\">Lance Price's Guardian claim this week that it is all about latent homophobia</a>. People are entitled to dislike other people without being accused of gay-bashing, antisemitism, racism or taking the mickey out of blondes.</p> <p>Myself, I've grown fonder of him over the years, but in Mandelson's case there is plenty to dislike. We all know too that he has a weakness for bling in many of its exotic forms. Throughout history there has always been a steady supply of rich men who want to bask in the reflected glory of the powerful.</p> <p>That does not make Mandelson \"Lord Sleaze\", as the Mail informed its readers when he got his return ticket from Brown. Foolish and vain perhaps, but a political asset to a somewhat lacklustre cabinet. Yes, it may quickly end in tears. Hastings predicts as much a few paragraphs before bemoaning the fact that Lord M has job security and index-linked pensions that the rest of us - even Max, poor chap - don't have.</p> <p>Anxious to protect Mandelson from himself, not least because we share an imminent birthday (no, we are not twins; he looks <em>so</em> much older!), I would only remind him - my birthday present this year - that it is the cover-up which always does most damage. </p> <p>If there are any \"facts\" - however innocuous or irrelevant - out there about his dealings with Comrade Aluminium he should disclose them rather than face endless drip-drip innuendo that will allow Victor Meldrew to say he is only doing Gordon a favour by exposing the viper at his bosom. So out with it, Pete, every last sip of ouzo, every cocktail olive. Victor demands to know!</p> <p>What was Meldrew's second barrel? I almost forgot. Tony Blair, Bernie Ecclestone and the formula one exemption \u2013 yes, that row back in the first heady days of New Labour's honeymoon, late 1997. </p> <p>Why has it resurfaced? Because the Sunday Telegraph finally won an FoI battle to get hold of the background papers which - so it assured its readers - <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/labour/3179770/Revealed-the-truth-about-Tony-Blairs-role-in-the-Ecclestone-Affair.html\">provides the \"truth\" about Blair's role in intervening to seek an F1 exemption</a> from the proposed cigarette advertising ban after a meeting with the diminutive car dealer who had recently donated \u00a31m to Labour's coffers.</p> <p>I have read and reread the Telegraph's account several times and - it must be old age - can't get very worked up about it either at a time when the fate of the world economy hangs in the balance. Yet the Mail's Glover, a sensitive and thoughtful chap much of the time, does manage a blood pressure surge under the headline \"The lie that lays bare the rank corruption of the Blair years\". But even he has to pad out his 1,500 words with quotes from Andrew Rawnsley's account - available without recourse to FoI in book form since 2000 - and the inevitable prod at Mandelson, always good for a couple of hundred words.</p> <p>Did Blair lie to MPs about the pattern of events after his meeting with Ecclestone on October 16 1997? The next day his staff informed health minister Tessa Jowell that the PM \"would like your ministers to look for ways of finding a permanent derogation for sport, particularly F1\".</p> <p>Not exactly a decision in any formal sense, though you do catch his drift. In later suggesting that the decision was taken weeks later - between October 24 and 31, Downing Street told reporters at the time - civil service notes worry that the claim might be judged \"disingenuous\". Etc etc. </p> <p>I went to the Telegraph website, hoping they might have published the full FoI discovery, so I could make up my own mind without the paper's aggressive editorial assistance. \"Res ipsa loquitur,\" as the Romans put it. I know that bit: let the thing speak for itself.</p> <p>Alas, the documents are not on the site. But if you read the link above, a version of Sunday's printed account, it does include - as the paper did not - this passage from the civil service backgrounder:</p> <blockquote> <p>We provided the lobby with an extremely detailed chronology of events in order to dispel any misapprehensions that the decision to exempt formula one was tied to the meeting the prime minister had with Ecclestone on 16 October. At all times the government has been guided by the desire to protect sport as well as public health, and it was false to claim the prime minister was railroading through health ministers. </p> <p>Clearly there had been a detailed train of events involving a number of ministers and officials at a number of departments. The decision was made during the period 24 October to 31 October and had been made collectively by correspondence as is usual.<br> <br>A meeting of ministers was not necessary. The Health Department was in the lead because of its public health role and would be involved in any European dimension. Tessa Jowell has said on the record that she has not been the victim of any prime ministerial edict to exempt formula one.</p> <p>As we can see from the chronology she had been fully involved in the decision-making process, and she and Frank Dobson were taking a lead.</p> </blockquote> <p>That tends to reinforce my own impression, then and now, that Blair set in train a review of the advertising ban as it affected the sport (a perfectly reasonable thing to do unless it was simply payback for the \u00a31m cheque) and that the final decision was evolved in the bureaucratic mill over the next fortnight. On the still partial evidence others may disagree.</p>",
  "<p>The schools secretary, Ed Balls, has rejected calls to abolish <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/sats\">Sats</a> tests for 11-year-olds in primary schools, saying such a move would mean letting parents and children down.</p> <p>Balls announced that KS3 tests would be scrapped yesterday and replaced with more teacher assessment. Report cards for schools will be introduced, grading them A to F.</p> <p>Teachers welcomed the abolition of KS3 but urged the scrapping of key stage tests at ages seven and 11 too.</p> <p>Balls said today that KS2 tests indicated how individual children and schools were performing and KS1 tests at age seven were \"more of an assessment by the teacher\" and enabled schools to give extra help to children who were falling behind in reading and maths.</p> <p>\"It is important in the end that kids go into secondary school with those basics under control. Without the Sats, we just don't know that that is happening,\" Balls said today.</p> <p>The government is considering replacing all Sats tests with a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2007/dec/11/schools.uk5\">'single-level, testing when ready'</a> scheme.</p> <p>Nearly 500 schools across England are taking part in the two-year 'making good progress' pilot.</p> <p>Teachers track pupils' progress in reading, writing and maths each term and give one-to-one tuition to help struggling pupils catch up.</p> <p>Teachers enter pupils for single-level, shorter tests twice a year in December and June when they are sure they are ready. The third cycle of tests will take place from December 1 to 3.</p> <p>The government <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/feb/15/schools.uk2\">delayed publishing the results</a> of the first round of tests taken in December.</p> <p>Ministers denied the tests were being made easier to help more pupils pass.</p> <p>Schools are said to have \"grave concerns\" about the tests, particularly that the pilot will not be fully evaluated before the government replaces Sats with it, and that the information could be used to produce more league tables than at present and put pupils into \"sets\" for their level.</p> <p>Mick Brookes, general secretary of the National Association of Headteachers (NAHT), said: \"We have no problem with the notion of single level testing per se but we will have a problem if there's bureaucratic paraphernalia around KS2 Sats which is extremely expensive to administer.</p> <p>Brookes said that the idea of sample snapshot tests and testing only when schools and children are ready was very similar to the Scottish system, which the NAHT favours.</p> <p>He added: \"We don't have a problem with the basic concept but the logistics of how schools receive these tests.</p> <p>\"What's going to be done with that information? The nightmare would be league tables for year 3 to year 6 [rather than at the end of the key stage]. That would identify individual teachers and we can't run with that.\"</p> <p>He also expressed concern over the report card for schools if it means that struggling schools are \"bashed with another label\" that makes parents flock to A-graded schools.</p> <p>\"A-band schools will not necessarily have better teachers, just easier pupils from more affluent areas with parental support,\" Brookes said.</p>",
  "<p>This year looks like being a total flopperoo for the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booker-prize\">Man Booker</a>. The long and short lists were met with a gigantic <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/oct/13/booker-prize-sales-odds\">consumer yawn</a> and have sold barely at all. Perhaps <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/oct/14/booker-prize-adiga-white-tiger\">the winner, Aravind Adiga</a>, will overcome the initial \"can you spell that for me\" resistance and go on to great things. But it seems more likely, as some have gloomily concluded, that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booker-prize\">Man Booker</a> is not the force it once was. An overhaul is in order (perhaps the annually touted suggestion that US authors be included).</p> <p>In a desperate attempt to pump some hot air into the deflating balloon, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/why-do-book-prizes-ignore-the-best-reads-960248.html\">Louise Doughty has named the guilty men</a>. Undeterred by the fact that there were no profs (of either sex) on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/table/2008/sep/29/booker-prize-winners-shortlists\">this year's panel</a> she excoriates \"male academics\" for invariably selecting prizes that will impress their colleagues, rather than selecting works that are readable. She does me the honour of being representative of this self-regarding band of ivory-tower snobs who, as she says, \"always have their eye on their reputations and always have a vested interest to pick someone as literary and obscure as possible\".</p> <p>Women academics get a pass in Doughty's deeply informed analysis of the current university world. Since women have to work so much harder (she tells us) to get to the top of the slippery academic pole they are \"a lot less poncey\" than their male counterparts. They can serve. So, one gathers, us male professors are to be aligned with criminal pimps and sex traffickers who live off the exploited earnings of prostitutes. Thank you, Louise. </p> <p>The word \"academic\", it would seem, has undergone the same kind of linguistic change as \"liberal\" in the US, where in the mouth of talk show hosts like <a href=\"http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/home/today.guest.html\">Rush Limbaugh</a> it is lower than \"child molester\". What next, yellow stars on our mortar boards?</p> <p>DJ Taylor \u2013 a critic whom I admire \u2013 has chipped in to support Doughty, naming <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/jun/04/art.oxforduniversity\">John Carey</a>, with whom Taylor served on the a Booker panel, as a professor \"not very au fait with the current state of writing\". Which, of course, is double-distilled bollocks. Carey reviews every week, for the Sunday Times, and has done for decades. He knows as much about the current state of writing as he does about Milton's Latin poetry. </p> <p>I would like to think that Taylor is shooting wildly from the hip and that Doughty is not being entirely serious. Or that she was drunk (I can surely suggest that, if she feels free to label me a ponce?)</p> <p>Doubtless there are male academics who fit Doughty's identikit portrait. But I'll refute her wild generalisations with two words that are only a key-stroke away from readers of this blog. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/johnmullan\">John Mullan</a>. This male academic runs a readers' group column, and hosts a weekly chat show with novelists, for the Guardian Review. His columns have been gathered in the manual, <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=9780199281787\">How Novels Work</a>.</p> <p>If you could only buy one work of fiction to take to your desert island, who would you rather be guided by? Louise Doughty or Professor Mullan? A sensible reader would, I think, answer \"both\". Ms Doughty is not being sensible.</p>",

  "<p>The government is drawing up plans to give the police and security and intelligence agencies new powers to access personal data held by internet services, including social network sites such as Facebook and Bebo and gaming networks.</p> <p>The move, heralded in this morning's speech on international terrorism by Jacqui Smith, the home secretary, is prompted by concern that criminals and terrorists are using websites as a way of concealing their communications, according to Whitehall security sources.</p> <p>At present, security and intelligence agencies can demand to see telephone and email traffic from traditional communications services providers (CSPs), which store the personal data for business purposes such as billing.</p> <p>The rapid expansion of new CSPs - such as gaming, social networking, auction and video sites - and technologies such as wireless internet and broadband present a serious problem for the police, MI5, customs and other government agencies, the security sources say.</p> <p>Sites such as Bebo and Facebook provide their services free, relying mainly on advertising for income. They do not hold records of their customers, many of whom in any case use pseudonyms.</p> <p>\"Criminals could use a chat facility - they are not actually playing the game but we can't actually get hold of the data,\" said one official. </p> <p>\"Criminal terrorists are exploiting free social networking sites,\" said another Whitehall security official, who added that the problem was compounded by the increasing use of data rather than voice in communications.</p> <p>\"People have many accounts and sign up as Mickey Mouse and no one knows who they are,\" he said. \"We have to do something. We need to collect data CSPs do not hold.\"</p> <p>Whitehall officials say that with the help of GCHQ - the electronic eavesdropping centre with a huge information storage capacity - the government is looking at different options that will be put out for consultation. They declined today to spell out the options but said that whatever is decided will need new legislation.</p> <p>Despite this reticence, it is clear that the government wants to be able to demand that the new generation of CSPs collect data from their customers so the security services can access them.</p> <p>The response from the networks is likely to be hostile, not least because of the potential costs involved.</p> <p>If the government, as expected, offers to pay for any new data access scheme, it is likely to cost taxpayers billions of pounds. </p> <p>The plan will need international cooperation since many of the new CSPs are based abroad, notably in the US.</p> <p>Government officials insist that what they call the interception modernisation programme, or IMP, is important since access to communications data is a crucial tool in combating crime such as paedophilia, kidnapping and drug trafficking.</p> <p>They say the planned new legislation would apply only to communications data - such addresses and names - but not to the actual contents of the communications.

  "<p>How much would you pay to buy back your own music? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/andrewlloydwebber\">Andrew Lloyd Webber</a> may be prepared to pay as much as \u00a3142m for the Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein Organisation, a music publisher that controls the rights to his songs.</p> <p>The Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein Organisation catalogue is one of the crown jewels in musical theatre, with rights to the work of more than 100 songwriters including Irving Berlin, Ira Gershwin, Kurt Weill and indeed Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein. They also represent Lord Lloyd-Webber's own musicals in the United States.</p> <p>As Rodgers's and Hammerstein's respective daughters, Mary Rodgers Guettel and Alice Hammerstein Mathias, are feeling time's tick-tock, they're looking for someone to purchase the business. And it's Webber himself, a baron of Broadway and the West End, who's leading the pack of buyers.</p> <p>The New York Post reported that Sony, Disney and the Ambassador Theatre Group are among the parties vying for the heiresses' attention. But Webber is the favourite. Not just because he's fabulously rich, though it helps - the minimum threshold for buy-out bids is said to be \u00a373m, with the daughters hoping for a reported \u00a3142m or so. More important still is that Webber has excelled with Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein properties in the past. His London revival of The Sound of Music \u2013 and the BBC take-off, The Search For Maria - is understood to have tickled the owners pink.</p> <p>\"He is putting together a bid,\" a source close to Lord Lloyd-Webber told the Evening Standard. They reported that Andre Ptaszynski, his chief executive, has been assembling an offer since last month. And the stakes are high. If Webber does snag all those Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein Organisation rights, not only will he control US productions of Cats and Phantom of the Opera \u2013 he will be in charge of Oklahoma, White Christmas and The Threepenny Opera. In short, he will be maestro of most of the world's great musicals.</p> <p>Which would certainly be something to sing about.</p>",

  "<h2>Vicky Redwood, UK economist at Capital Economics</h2> <p>\"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/oct/15/unemploymentdata-recession\">UK unemployment is continuing its upward march</a>. September's rise in the claimant count measure of 31,800 was slightly lower than August's rise. But at this rate, the claimant count will still surpass 1m by the end of this year. And the wider ILO measure of unemployment is shooting up much more quickly. The 164,000 rise in the 3 months to August (driven by a sharp drop in employment) pushed the unemployment rate up to 5.7% from 5.2% in the previous quarter. With the UK heading into recession, we expect this measure to rise by a total of 1.5m to around 3m or 9% by the end of 2010,\" she said. </p> <p>\"The threat of a pick-up in pay growth has therefore all but disappeared. Indeed, the 3.4% headline rate of average earnings growth in August was its lowest since 2003. With inflationary pressures outside the labour market now easing markedly too, the way's clear for aggressive interest rate cuts.\"</p> <h2>Howard Archer at Global Insight</h2> <p>\"It seems inevitable that unemployment will rise sharply further over the coming months as near certain recession and depressed business confidence impact. Extended very tight credit conditions would also be liable to lead to firms having to shed jobs. Consequently, claimant count unemployment seems poised to move above 1 million in November and we expect it to climb markedly higher through 2009. Indeed, it could well reach 2 million in 2010. Unemployment on the ILO measure seems certain to rise well above 2 million in 2009,\" Archer said.</p> <h2>Alan Clarke at BNP Paribas</h2> <p>\"The claimant count number may have shown an increase of 32k - not quite as bad as the 35k consensus - but the ILO numbers were simply awful. The ILO measure of unemployment rose by 164k in the last 3 months, that compares to an 81k reported the prior month and is the biggest rise since July 1991,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Employment was equally depressing, with employment falling by 122k in the latest 3 months. That compares to a 16k loss the prior month. </p> <p>\"Earnings growth was more subdued than expected, slowing to 3.4% 3m/yr for the headline (from 3.5) and ex bonus slowing to 3.6% 3m/yr (from 3.7).</p> <p>\"To summarise - these data are grim. Employment is falling off a cliff and it is still early days in this slowdown. Unemployment is rising at a pace not seen since the worst of the early 90s recession.\" </p> <h2>David Kern at the British Chambers of Commerce</h2> <p>\"The worse-than-expected labour market figures highlight the deepening recessionary pressures in the economy. Unemployment is rising, and employment is falling, at their fastest quarterly rates since the early 1990s. Unemployment will rise above the two million mark earlier than we expected. But average earnings growth is falling, confirming that inflationary pressures are easing,\" he said.</p> <p>\"In view of the deteriorating situation, the MPC must now seriously consider a half per cent cut in interest rates at its November meeting. It is also critically important for the Government to announce cuts in business taxation.\"</p> <h2>Lib Dem shadow work and pensions secretary Jenny Willott</h2> <p>\"These figures come as no surprise and are only likely to get worse over the coming months. The effects of the banking crisis have filtered down to the real economy and are affecting people across the county,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Now the banking rescue package has been agreed, the Government must turn its attention to unemployment and inflation. Real families across Britain are suffering, not just those working in the Square Mile. </p> <p>\"As the number of vacancies shrink, it will be harder and harder to get people back into work. It will not simply be a case of retraining the unemployed if there are no jobs for them to return to.\"</p> <h2>Nigel Meager, director of the Institute for Employment Studies</h2> <p>\"Measured unemployment continues to grow, and will keep doing so in the months ahead as the effect of the financial crisis feeds through into the real economy. The labour market responds with a lag to economic changes, however, and it is still too early to say how big the overall impact on employment will be. Developments in the last month mean that an economic recession in the months ahead is almost certain, but its depth and duration are much less certain.<br> \"The labour market has entered this downturn in better shape than it was in previous downturns, and there are still reasons to hope that it may prove more resilient. Since January this year the claimant count increase has averaged 18,000 per month; in the very early stages of the last two recessions it averaged well over 50,000 per month. Reductions in migration and in the numbers of older workers staying on in the labour market may dampen the overall impact on unemployment this time round.\"</p> <h2>CBI's deputy director-general John Cridland</h2> <p>\"These figures are worse than we expected. They suggest the fallout from the slowdown in the economy is being felt by individuals faster and sooner than previously thought. These figures pre-date the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the turbulence which followed, indicating unemployment is likely to rise further through the winter. <br> \"However, changes in the economy since the recessions of the eighties and early nineties should help us avoid the levels of unemployment we saw then. The UK labour market is much more flexible and the recent moderation in pay settlements will help.  \"Inflation is also expected to fall sharply over the coming year, allowing the Bank of England to reduce interest rates further to help support the economy.\"</p>",

A native of southern California, Davis is known for his books on urban history and immigration, most recently No One Is Illegal: Fighting Racism and State Violence on the US-Mexico Border. In it, he writes about the resurgence of nativist anti-immigrant politics and of racist vigilante violence, expressed in the battles taking place on the border. </p> <p>Close to the nation's busiest highway border crossing, from San Diego County to Tijuana, a <a href=\"http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/mexico/tijuana/20080227-9999-1m27realign.html\">border fence</a> cuts across a park and a beach before stretching into the surf of the Pacific Ocean. This is the westernmost edge of the demarcation line in the US's war against unauthorised immigration, and we are heading into a militarised zone.</p> <p>As Davis talks to us, three Mexican-American women walk towards the fence. Every so often, they stop, look at their watches and make a call on a mobile phone. The two younger women are taking their aunt to meet a grandmother she has not seen in 10 years. Their reunion will take place across the fence - one of the many that now cover long stretches of the 1,952-mile border between the US and Mexico. </p> <p>The border fence here is just one piece of what Davis has called \"the <a href=\"http://www.globalpolicy.org/globaliz/special/2004/0119greatwall.htm\">Great Wall of Capital</a>, which separates a few dozen rich countries from the Earth's poor majority\". It is patrolled, he says, just as vigilantly as the old iron curtain, and with considerably more sophisticated technology. \"This part of the border is lined with every kind of motion detector [and] heat sensitive surveillance technology they possess,\" he says. </p> <p>In 2006, the US Congress passed legislation calling for the construction of 700 miles of border fence between Texas and California; about 200 miles have been built so far. \"This fence contradicts the entire logic of free trade,\" Davis tells us. In the last decade, about 5,000 people have died trying to cross the border. Many of them have perished in barren deserts and canyons.</p> <p>The women reach the fence and locate their relatives. An emotional reunion takes place through the spaces between the fence's tall, vertical bars. Hands are extended through the slots, and faces are pressed up to exchange kisses. As we draw near with our cameras, a border patrol truck appears atop the hill, to our rear. A man gets out and watches us through binoculars. </p> <p>The fence, which stretches across the beach at San Ysidro, has served as a cross-border meeting place - though not for much longer. \"People come here because there are parts of the fence that are open and you can talk to your relatives, hold hands. But all this will soon end,\" Davis explains. \"They are creating a no man's land, blocking off access here: no more family reunions on Sunday or kissing your girlfriend ... This wall is a guillotine cutting through people's lives, dividing their families.\" </p> <p>Still, the plight of immigrants has yet to emerge as a major civil rights issue in the US. And in the current presidential election, this controversial issue has been enclosed in a wall of silence as unbreachable as any border fence. </p> <p>Soon, the three women have said their goodbyes and turn to leave. One young woman has her arms around her aunt as they walk past us. The aunt is crying. </p> <p>We start heading back, away from the ocean, along the road in the darkness. Suddenly, there are trucks across the road with bright lights pointed at us - so bright that, for a moment, we can't see. As we approach, slowly, guards lounge on the fenders. Not a word is uttered. We pass by and are swallowed up by the night.</p>",
  "<p>Fighting has broken out between Thai and Cambodian soldiers along a disputed stretch of the countries' border.</p> <p>Soldiers from both sides exchanged rocket and gunfire yesterday near the 900-year-old Preah Vihear temple that both Thailand and Cambodia claim, according to the Reuters news agency. The temple sits atop a cliff in the Dangrek mountains.</p> <p>\"I heard gunfire all over the place in this area,\" said Chor Sokunthea, a Reuters photographer.</p> <p>\"One rocket flew from Thailand over my head and landed. Now you can hear the fighting. They've opened fire. I have to find a safe place to hide.\"</p> <p>Thailand sent more soldiers to the disputed stretch of the border, a Thai general said yesterday, within hours of a Cambodian general saying Thai troops had pulled back.</p> <p>On Monday, the Cambodian prime minister, Hun Sen, threatened to turn the area into a \"death zone\" unless the Thais retreated by midday yesterday.</p> <p>The Thai military said it was ready for war and the foreign ministry told Thais to \"think twice\" before visiting Cambodia. Five years ago, a nationalist mob torched the Thai embassy in Phnom Penh over an argument about another ancient Hindu temple.</p> <p>Tensions between the two countries have been high since July, when 2,000 soldiers faced off a few metres apart in trenches dug into a hillside that until 10 years ago was under the control of remnants of the Khmer Rouge, Pol Pot's guerrilla army.</p> <p>The dispute centres on 1.8 square miles (4.6 sq km) of scrub near the temple, which the international court of justice awarded to Cambodia in 1962 - a ruling that has rankled in Thailand ever since.</p> <p>The dispute flared up in July after protesters trying to overthrow the Thai government attacked Bangkok's backing of Phnom Penh's bid to list the Hindu ruins as a world heritage site.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>\"Owain Glyndwr is the biggest Welsh hero we have had and I'm massive on him. I've done all my Welsh history through the years. The battle of Pilleth is going down my arm. I'm Welsh so I want to know where I'm from.\"</strong> Craig Bellamy is Welsh through and through alright, but should you need any more proof, he missed a penalty against Liechtenstein last weekend. His was the third miss by the third Welshman in three World Cup qualifiers so far, Jason Koumas and Gareth Bale failing against Azerbaijan and Russia respectively, a spectacularly useless record but one which at least allows everyone to forget Paul Bodin for ten minutes.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Still, despite it all, should Wales be awarded a spot kick tonight in Germany, where they drew 0-0 last year, Bellamy is not afraid to take it.</strong> Unless Koumas grabs the ball first, that is. \"If someone else wants it, they can have it,\" whistles Bellamy, hands in pockets, ambling in the general direction of the plate.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>Possible four-in-a-row spot-kick humiliation begins at:</strong> 7.45pm.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>The first Aneurin Bevan related question of the evening:</strong> \"Would you know where the pic of Nye Bevan is from?\" asks Michael Aston. \"I ask as a 25-year Welsh absentee, I now live in Los Angeles, and the image looks like Port Talbot, a hellhole I escaped so long ago. By the way, you are correct in that the (informed) Welsh regard Nye as the greatest son of them all.\" Your greatest son is observing the workers being shafted by capitalism at the steelworks in his Ebbw Vale constituency, Michael, while deciding what boot to aim a swing at The Man's knackers with. But more importantly, what does LA have that Port Talbot doesn't?</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>Michael Ballack passes a late fitness test for Germany. The last time he did that was before the final of Euro 2008, and look what happened there:</strong> Adler, Friedrich, Westermann, Mertesacker, Lahm, Schweinsteiger, Ballack, Hitzlsperger, Trochowski, Podolski, Klose.<br>Subs: Wiese, Fritz, Tasci, Rolfes, Frings, Helmes, Gomez.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>Owain Glyndwr's No1 fan will be the lone striker for Wales, West Ham defender James Collins featuring for the first time in 11 months:</strong> Hennessey, Gunter, Bale, Morgan, Collins, Williams, Davies, Koumas, Fletcher, Edwards, Bellamy.<br>Subs: Myhill, Ricketts, Cotterill, Nyatanga, Vaughan, Evans, Robinson.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>Referee:</strong> Laurent Duhamel (France)</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>The players are out, and they're listening to their anthems.</strong> Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau is up first, and for the love of Aneurin H Bevan it goes on for <em>bloody ages</em>. Plenty of pipes going on, it's all very strangely Irish. Then it's time for a cymbal-heavy Das Deutschlandlied, which is only half the length, clocking in at a mere 13 minutes.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>And we're off!</strong> Bellamy sets the ball rolling, or more accurately, flying at a preposterous velocity, the West Ham striker trying to beat Adler from just by the centre spot with the second kick of the game. Anyway, Ebbw Vale. \"Michael Aston has a good memory, it does look like Port Talbot,\" writes Gareth Evans. \"I remember at one of his stand-up gigs in Cardiff, acclaimed Welsh stand-up Rhod Gilbert asked a member of the public where they were from. When they answered 'Port Talbot', Rhod followed up with '...And what do you do, apart from rinse the stink out of your clothes?' Which is definitely reflected in the above picture. Come to think of it you probably had to be there.\"</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>3 min:</strong> It's been a very quiet start to the match. Germany have enjoyed nearly all the possession but they're doing nothing with it. Lahm tries to ping one in from the left towards Klose but his cross is much too juicy and it flies over the striker's head and into the arms of Hennessey.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>4 min:</strong> This is basic attack v defence stuff at the moment, every long German ball being swept clear by Collins and Morgan. Fletcher tries to instigate a rare sortie in the German half but he's shoved contemptuously off the ball by Hitzlsperger.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>6 min:</strong> A wonderful run from deep by Edwards, who tears straight down the middle of the pitch and plays the ball forward. It's a pretty aimless pass but it clanks off a German ankle and breaks back to him, allowing the midfielder to scoot clear of the home back line. Edwards should be afforded the opportunity of banging one in on goal, but the play is pulled back as Bellamy is lying on the floor in an offside position. Germany were lucky there.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>9 min:</strong> Apart from that one surge by Edwards, Wales have kept the ball for approximately 0.0000000063 seconds so far. They are unlikely to be worried about this yet.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>10 min:</strong> Ballack drops a shoulder 25 yards out and unleashes a low, hard shot which Collins blocks brilliantly with a sliding lunge. No scares yet for Wales, though they'll be coming soon if Germany maintain their share of the ball.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>12 min:</strong> Podolski diddles around the edge of the Welsh area but can't break through the nine-man back line. This is going to be a long evening.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>15 min:</strong> German pass, German pass, German pass, German pass, German pass, German pass, German pass, German pass, German pass, German pass, German pass, German pass, German pass, German pass, German pass, Welsh boot hacks clear, German pass, German pass, German pass, German pass, German pass, German pass, German pass, German pass, German pass, German pass, Welsh boot slices clear, German pass, German pass, German pass, German pass, German pass, German pass, German pass, German pass, German pass, Welsh boot shanks clear, German pass, German pass, German pass, German pa... you get the idea.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>16 min:</strong> Klose releases Schweinsteiger down the right. Schweinsteiger cuts the ball back from the byline into the centre, where Podolski is rocking on his heels. The cross is hacked back out to the right, where Klose takes a first-time shot towards the bottom-right corner. It's always curling wide of the post, but a decent effort nonetheless. Meanwhile something's rotten in the state of Wales. \"That image does have a whiff of sulphur,\" writes Michael Aston, remembering the good old days while looking out over Sunset Strip and wondering which Beverly Hills jazz bar to visit later. \"I remember the odious stench (like rotten eggs) of the mills and recalled my grandmother telling me the Germans tried to flatten Port Talbot in the war but the mountains made it too difficult a target. Damn poor shots the Hun. Thatcher did a much better job.\" Ladies and gentlemen, get your satire 24/7 here on theguardian.com/sport.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>18 min:</strong> Bellamy has another shot from preposterous distance, this time about 40 yards, but <em>come on</em>.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>21 min:</strong> Bale, who is having a torrid time down Germany's right, hacks down Klose just outside the area on the wing. The free kick from Schweinsteiger is well delivered and deep, dropping at the far post where Westermann waits to volley home from four yards. But Klose rises before it reaches him and heads wildly wide and high. If he'd left that, Wales would probably have been behind.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>23 min:</strong> Wales enjoy seven seconds of possession in the German half. Yes, they really have done it! Still, the crowd in the Borussia-Park is pretty quiet at the moment, Germany having only created one real chance. Frustration won't be long in coming, I'll be bound. So it's all going to plan so far.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>24 min:</strong> And here's a thing: you never know what might happen up the other end, what with it only taking a second to score a goal and all that. Gunter races after a long, high, bouncing ball down the right flank. Lahm fannies around, much as he did in the final of Euro 2008 when Fernando Torres made him look very silly indeed before scoring, and is relieved to hear the referee blow up for a non-existent shirt pull when Gunter nips ahead of him and scoots clear into the German area with two Welsh players in the centre. That is a terrible decision by the referee, and decent harrying by Gunter.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>27 min:</strong> Bale plays a good first-time ball down the inside-left channel for Bellamy, who takes a shot from the edge of the area. He's attempting to find the top-right corner, and only just misses. Adler would have got there, I think, as he pulls his arm away to avoid conceding the corner. The last few minutes have been encouraging for Wales, in terms of time on the ball as much as chances, and the crowd are indeed beginning to get slightly cakey with the home side.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>30 min:</strong> Astounding work by Podolski down the left, there, as he drops a shoulder, spins 180 degrees and leaves Morgan for dead. He runs clear into the box. The ball he slips into the centre, however, is witlessness in spherical form, and easily cleared.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>31 min:</strong> Schweinsteiger picks the ball up from Ballack, 25 yards out, and sends a screaming, dipping shot pinging off the top of the Welsh crossbar and into the crowd. A very decent effort, and suddenly Wales are on the back foot again.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>35 min:</strong> Schweinsteiger feeds Podolski on the edge of the area; the latter's snapshot on the turn is low, hard and accurate, and well swiped clear by Williams. Wales have more than steadied the ship here. The Borussia-Park is like a library.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>37 min:</strong> Lahm takes a whack from distance. Deflected. Corner. Hitzlsperger wallops it in. Cleared. Hitzlsperger picks it up in the centre, Deflected. Corner. It's a sudden period of pressure for the home side, but it comes to a sorry end with Klose needlessly misplacing a pass out of play. The locals are not happy.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>41 min:</strong> Ballack has a swipe from 30 yards out. It's low, hard and heading to the bottom-left corner but Hennessey is down well to smother. That's the first effort Germany have got on target. John Toshack will be more than pleased with the way things are going so far. Meanwhile Gareth Price wonders why Michael Aston felt the need to move to LA. \"From the pictures all it seems to be is mountains and beaches and we've got plenty of both in Port Talbot. And as for Welsh comics, a couple of years ago on hearing a member of the audience was from Port Talbot, a compere said: 'Ah Port Talbot - on a nice clean day you can sometimes see across the room to your wardrobe.' Thought I'd give a balanced view of the place.\"</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>44 min:</strong> Koumas picks the ball up in the middle of the German half and advances towards the area. He's got an opportunity to shoot from distance, but decides to try to outwit Mertesacker by dropping a shoulder. Unfortunately he somehow drops both, showcasing the demeanour of a man who has spent all day telling the boss exactly what he thinks of him only to get home and find out his lottery ticket has been washed with his trousers, and falls over. A half-chance wasted.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>HALF TIME: Germany 0-0 Wales.</strong> That was fairly impressive from the Welsh, who limited Germany to a couple of half-chances and long-range shots. They've created next to nothing themselves up the other end, but then that's not really the point.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>And we're off again!</strong> A change for Germany, Klose going off to be replaced by Helmes. Peter Cooney has spent the entire first half searching for a picture of Owain Glyndwr and couldn't find one either, but has sent me this link to <a href=\"http://www.nmm.ac.uk/collections/images/560/F/37/F3795.jpg\">a lovely port broadside view of the Owen Glendower</a> from the National Maritime Museum.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>47 min:</strong> Some nice interplay between Bellamy and Koumas, the former nearly being sprung clear of the German back line. The flag goes up though. \"To be even more fair to Port Talbot,\" writes Gareth Evans, \"what other small to medium sized town can claim to have given birth to such a rich list of cultural icons like Anthony Hopkins, Richard Burton, Rob Brydon and Paul Potts (the fat chap with a tidy voice from Britain's Got Talent)?\" Having not watched Britain's Got Talent, I had to google to check that you weren't playing me for an even bigger eejit than I am re Paul Potts. But, wow, that really is his name. I'm now waiting for the day the X-Factor is won by a girl group called Chairman Meow.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>49 min:</strong> Germany are becoming increasingly sloppy. Ballack rolls a hospital ball to Lahm; Williams is quickly in to break up play.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>50 min:</strong> Much better from Germany. Schweinsteiger feeds Podolski with a lovely ball down the left. Podolski twists and turns in the box, then having pulled two defenders out with him, lays the ball back to Trochowski. The German's attempted sidefoot into the bottom-right corner is blocked by Collins, who flings himself at the ball to concede a corner. Great play all round. Germany waste the corner.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>52 min:</strong> This is becoming more open now. Bellamy jiggles down the left, reaches the byline, and cuts a beautiful low ball across the face of goal. Nobody's in the centre to convert, though. Is this more free-flowing game good for Wales? Probably not, but time will tell.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>54 min:</strong> Maybe it will be better for Wales. Bale wins a corner, Wales's first, with a direct run down the right. The ball's swung in towards Collins, who causes a bit of bother at the far post but is eventually penalised for next to nothing.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>55 min:</strong> Now a great chance for Wales, as Edwards helps on a simple up-and-under from Hennessey, his header finding Bellamy clear down the inside-right channel! He puts his head down and tears into the box, but his low shot is easily parried by Adler. That wasn't a great effort by Bellamy; Wales should now be ahead.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>58 min:</strong> What a miss from Trochowski, who takes a wild clean-air swipe at a ball from six yards out after Schweinsteiger shimmies down the right and cuts it back into space. Now that <em>really</em> should have been 1-0. \"So far, the Germans have been disorganised, lacking in aggression and inefficient in their use of the ball; same old, same old,\" opines the tinder-dry Richard Watkins.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>59 min:</strong> And now a terrible miss from Helmes, falling over four yards out on the slippery turf (it's started to rain quite hard) when the net was gaping. Collins bundles the ball away. Ballack argues he's done it with his arm, but the referee is having none of it.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>63 min:</strong> Wales take the sting out of the game. First Bale goes down after a nothing challenge with Mertesacker, wasting a minute or so, then Koumas and Williams co-ordinate a period of easy Welsh possession in the centre circle.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>65 min:</strong> Lahm takes a swipe from distance and it's not too far away, sending the side netting on the left of the Welsh goal billowing. Fritz replaces Friedrich. The home crowd have got the funk on, whistling at every Welsh pass.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>68 min:</strong> Westermann passes straight forward to Hitzlsperger, who passes straight forward to... well, nobody. Germany are looking lifeless at the moment. \"To add to the Port Talbot list,\" writes Gareth Price, \"there's currently rugby player James Hook of English-defeating fame, and Geoffrey Howe of, well, <em>that</em> government. English-defeating fame also; the north at least.\"</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>70 min:</strong> There is an <em>almighty</em> scramble in the Welsh area, Podolski trying to make his best of a long ball which dropped in the six-yard box. The ball eventually ends up in Hennessey's arms, but only after Collins gives it a crafty nudge back to him. That really should have been a free kick for a back-pass, but the referee doesn't give anything.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>71 min:</strong> This is a really great game now. Bellamy has a rasp from 25 yards which Adler juggles, nearly letting Davies toe-poke home. Up the other end, Hitzlsperger has a decent dig from distance. Corner. From the corner, Westermann has a shot from eight yards out on the left - and it's brilliantly deflected wide of goal by Hennessey.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>72 min: GOAL! Germany 1-0 Wales.</strong> But it's not such a great game from a Welsh perspective now. From the resulting corner, Trochowski, who earlier missed an easy chance with a fresh-air swipe, twists left and right, then cuts inside from the left and unleashes a magical shot into the top right.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>74 min:</strong> Williams hacks down Schweinsteiger 25 yards out in the centre. Ballack steps up to take a curling free kick - which hammers off the bottom of the left-hand post, Hennessey tipping it brilliantly away with his fingers. There is an understandable air of total dejection around the Welsh at the moment.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>77 min:</strong> Edwards and Fletcher are replaced with Robinson and Evans. Toshack has obviously decided to go for it.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>78 min:</strong> Koumas has a pelt from nearly 30 yards. Adler was never spilling it.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>80 min:</strong> That really should have been 1-1. Bellamy scoots clear down the left and rolls a brilliant ball into the centre of the box. Davies over-runs it, though, and blocks Gunter, who is racing in behind him. Gunter eventually gets an effort in, but Mertesacker races in to block.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>82 min:</strong> Podolski is replaced by Gomez. \"That Nye Bevan built the NHS out of the ruins of Britain's post-War economy is little short of miraculous,\" writes Gary Naylor, \"but not as miraculous as it would have been had a country with Wales's playing resources gone to Germany and got a point. Hats off to them.\"</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>85 min:</strong> Hennessey fails to hold onto a Hitzlsperger shot, but he parries Helmes's follow-up effort - then Williams flings himself at Ballack's final attempt. Brilliant last-ditch defending. Another goal for Germany would be hard on Wales.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>87 min:</strong> Ricketts comes on for Gunter and within a minute is booked for pulling back Hitzlsperger.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>89 min:</strong> Helmes slices haplessly over when free 12 yards out, then heads wildly high and wide after connecting with a deep right-wing cross. He should have made more of both of those chances.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>90 min:</strong> There will be three more minutes of this. Bale injects a sense of urgency by swaggering down the left and winning a throw deep in German territory. Can Wales make something of this?</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>90 min +1:</strong> No.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>90 min +2:</strong> Ballack lays the ball back to Hitzlsperger, who sends a missle just wide right of goal.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>FULL TIME: Germany 1-0 Wales.</strong> Ballack diddles around in the Welsh area in the hope of adding a slightly flattering second... but he's harried out of it. The whistle goes: that's it. Wales made a decent fist of that, and could easily have made it out of town with a draw, but it wasn't to be. And that was a very, very good goal by Trochowski.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Good evening everyone: </strong>So here we are for a World Cup qualifier many people will be surprised to see Belarus turning up for considering the foregone conclusion many of the English journalists I've been reading seem to think tonight's match is. A couple of months ago, this is exactly the kind of game many of them would have been expecting to see England slip-up in, but not tonight. What a difference a thrashing of Croatia and a fairly unconvincing 5-1 win (in so much as a 5-1 win can be unconvincing) over Kazakhstan makes, eh? </p> <p>But then, these are men \u2013 yes, I've checked and they're all pot-bellied, middle-aged men with questionable personal hygiene and egg-stains on their shirts \u2013 who seem to think that Rio Ferdinand's decision to blame the abject failure of England at the last World Cup on some tikka-tinged young ladies in over-sized designer sunglasses and expensive Jimmy Choos is a step in the right direction. </p> <p>Why? </p> <p>Everyone knows it was the preening divas who took to the field that were responsible for embarrassing England at Germany 2006, not their headline-hogging female counterparts who ran amok in the boutiques of Baden-Baden. <br> Anyway, the Belarusians. They're no world-beaters, but certainly not the pushovers some of our more jingoistic cheerleaders would have us believe either. They've beaten Holland away in the past (albeit in a dead rubber), drawn with Germany (albeit in a friendly) and came <em>this</em> close to a qualification play-off for World Cup 2002 against the Germans, only to have their dreams trashed by the Welsh. </p> <p>Sorry Belarus, I'm not selling you very well, am I?</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>The Guardian's policy on booing:</strong> Considering the only people I've heard complaining about the booing at Wembley over the weekend are journalists, players and FA blazers who probably can't remember the last time they had to pay to watch a football match, I think they have a bit of a cheek telling riff-raff supporters how they can and cannot behave in their \u00a360 seats. With that in mind, feel free to boo (and booze) away to your heart's content as you read this commentary. If I spell a Belarusian player's name wrong or bring you news of passages of play that's littered with typos, I want to hear all about it.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>Team news:</strong> Wayne Bridge gets his first competitive start with England for 11 months at the Dinamo Stadium in Minsk.

It's an unintentionally hilarious piece of work, filmed in black and white, in which the star of such masterpieces as Mean Machine and Severance goes all method to explain how \"Form! Style! Cunning! Guile and a bit of pride in the shirt!\" are all hallmarks of the \"new\" England. This Setanta executive has obviously never seen The Real Football Factories, otherwise they'd know it's never a good idea to get Danny Dyer, who has a daughter named Dani, to do anything anywhere near a camera.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>Pre-match niceties:</strong> The teams line up in the tunnel of a packed stadium that looks ramshackle, even by eastern European standards. They march out over the obligatory running track on to the pitch and line up for the national anthems.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>1 min:</strong> Referee Terje Hauge gets proceedings underway and Belarus kick off, lining out in a 4-4-2 formation.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>2 min:</strong> Belarusian winger Igor Stasevich attempts to get a cross in to the England box from the right wing, but his effort is blocked by Wayne Bridge. For those who are interested, Gerrard is playing wide on the left of a 4-4-2 England formation, where my colleague Rob Smyth says \"he'll contribute nothing\".</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>4 min:</strong> Walcott crosses into the Belarus penalty area from the right, but his pass falls behind Wayne Rooney and out of the striker's reach. Moments previously, a long-distance potshot from a Belarus player brought a save out of David James, but didn't trouble the Observer columnist unduly.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>6 min:</strong> Over hogging the <em>right</em> touchline, Steven Gerrard picks out Theo Walcott, who curls a marvellous cross in towards Wayne Rooney, who might have poked the ball home if he'd put as much effort into his goalscoring attempt as he had into his penalty appeal.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>9 min:</strong> Belarus, whose players all look very comfortable on the ball, attack. They're really going for it here - there isn't a hint of caution from the home side.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Belarus 0-1 England (Gerrard 10)</strong> My colleague Rob Smyth sinks his head into his hands as Steven Gerrard cuts in from the left wing, picks up the ball from Wayne Rooney and hammers a low, diagonal 25-yard drive just inside the right-hand post. It was a fine goal and the Liverpool striker celebrates accordingly. Kudos to Wayne Rooney too, who did very well to hold the ball up.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>14 min:</strong> Vitali Bulyga has a pop from distance, which James gets down to gather, spill, then gather again.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>15 min:</strong> Steven Gerrard has another strike from distance, but while close, there's no cigar for him this time. His long-range effort whistles a couple of feet wide of the left upright.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>17 min:</strong> Another Belarusian, Anton Putsilo, strikes from distance. Again the shot is on target, but David James is equal to it. The home side are no slouches, but England have made things easy for them since going a goal up. They're just sitting off Belarus, letting their opponents play through them with simple one-twos and give-and-gos.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>18 min:</strong> Belarus carve England open again and Vitali Kutuzov is teed up for a shot on goal. His low drive brings a good save out of David James, who's earning his wages tonight.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>20 min:</strong> Anton Putsila, a 21-year-old who's deputising for injured Belarus superstar Aleksandr Hleb tonight gets booked for a foul on Frank Lampard that might well have earned him his marching orders.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>24 min:</strong> England have gone to sleep. Belarus are running rings around them at the moment and you can't help but feel they'd be level or ahead if only they had a decent finisher.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Belarus 1-1 England (Sitko 27)</strong> That's been coming and it was a belter. After an unbelievably patient build-up by Belarus, Pavel Sitko ghosts between the slumbering Theo Walcott and Wes Brown to get on the end of a cross from Igor Stasevich and steer a header past the hopelessly exposed David James from about seven yards.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>30 mins:</strong> Fabio Capello is furious and rightfully so. Since going a goal up, his midfielders have downed tools, putting their defence under no end of pressure in the process. Walcott was badly at fault for that goal, while Igor Stasevich made fools out of Wayne Bridge and Matthew Upson as he sold them the mother of all dummies before getting his cross on to Sitko's head.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>32 min:</strong> Moments before Belarus equalised, Wayne Rooney went close for England, trying and failing to force his way between two defenders at the far post in a bid to nod home an excellent Emile Heskey cross.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>35 min:</strong> Sergei Omelyanchuk escapes a booking for a nasty challenge on Theo Walcott, but England win a free-kick about 35 yards from the Belarus goal, slightly left of centre. Lampard has a crack, but the goalkeeper, Zhevnov, saves easily.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>37 min:</strong> Although I didn't count them at the time, I'm reliably informed that the header that got Belarus off the mark was the final flourish of a 23-pass move. Can anyone remember the last time one of the home countries scored at the end of a 23-pass move? Me neither. A three-pass move? If I think <em>really</em> hard.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>39 min:</strong> A long ball into space from Heskey for Walcott to chase. Belarusian goalkeeper Zhevnov wins the race to the edge of the box and hoofs it clear. Soon afterwards, Walcott sprints into the Belarus penalty area with the ball at his feet. With team-mates queuing up to get on the end of his cross, he's dispossessed by a wonderful tackle from Spartak Moscow's Egor Filipenko.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>42 min:</strong> \"Doesn't Rob Smyth realise that Steven Gerrard is one of the best football players in the whole world?\" asks Amy, via email. \"I'm a girl and even I know that. He must be stupid or just someone who doesn't like Liverpool as much as I do. Stevie G is well fit. Why can't I get Setanta in Camden?\" You can get tattoos, nipple-piercings and drunk with Johnny Borrell and the Mighty Boosh in Camden - you don't need the low-rent crap on offer from Setanta when that paucity of entertainment can be found in your locale.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>Half-time</strong></p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>Half-time analysis:</strong> \"As a fellow Seinfeld fan, all I know about Minsk is that it was the setting for the film Rochelle, Rochelle \u2013 described by Jerry as 'a young girl's sensual journey from Moscow to Minsk'. Any sight of her in the stands?\" asks Mike Wilner. No sign of her, Mike, but if she's there she might be sitting beside Chandler Bing from friends, who I believe had to fly to Minsk after getting trapped in a lie he told his ex-girlfriend.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>That equaliser: </strong> I've just seen the Belarus goal again and it was a thing of great beauty, but shame on England for not getting a single tackle in as Belarus patiently passed and probed before carving them open at the end of a move that started with their own goalkeeper.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>An email from Robin Hazlehurst: </strong> \"Doesn't Amy realise that Sergei Omelyanchuk is one of the best football players in the whole world?\" he asks. \"No, I'd never heard of him before tonight either, but if he plays international football he must be better at football than most people. Doesn't guarantee he'll do much of note tonight. Same can often be said of Stevie G.\"</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>46 min:</strong> There's no changes on either team at the start of the second half, although David Beckham is gadding about in a red bib on the touchline.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>47 min:</strong> Fabio Capello curses loudly on the sideline as Theo Walcott fails to control the ball properly and toe-pokes it out for a throw-in.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>48 min:</strong> Wayne Rooney charges through the centre with the ball at his feet, takes on and beats two Belarus defenders and tries a shot from the edge of the penalty area. His effort is weak and straight at the goalkeeper.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Belarus 1-2 England (Rooney 50)</strong> England retake the lead when Emile Heskey uses all his strength and what passes for his pace to muscle his way past two Belarus defenders and whip a low cross in for Wayne Rooney to sidefoot home. There was a hint of offside, but it was a very good goal.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>52 min:</strong> England appear to have started the second half, much as they began their game against Kazakhstan on Saturday, with Gerrard operating behind Rooney and Heskey and Barry nearer the left wing than he was originally. It didn't work against Kazakhstan, but so far so good here.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>Corrections and clarification dept:</strong> \"Chandler Bing flew to Yemen to get away from Janice,\" writes Simon Jenkins. \"It was Phoebe's boyfriend David who went to Minsk my 'girlfriend' tells me.\"</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>59 min:</strong> In the penalty area, a meaty shoulder from Wes Brown puts a stop to Aleksandr Kulchy's gallop as the Belarus skipper attempts to get on the end of another Stasevich cross. The crowd appeal for a penalty but none is forthcoming. Good decision.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>61 min:</strong> \"As an American I'm willing to trade Joe Biden, Landon Donovan, Tim Howard, and all the states that are named after some English backward town (New Hampshire, New Jersey, etc; but we keep New York (all of it but Staten Island if they want it)) to England for Stevie G, the<br>Falklands, the rights to reclaim TS Eliot as an American and a back<br>bencher to be named later,\" writes Bobby Otter. \"As an impartial observer, what do you think? Who gets the better end of that deal?\" If it was down to me, I'd say keep Landon Donovan and you've got yourself a deal, Bobby. Unfortunately none of the above is mine to give away. How about trading the Irish midlands town of Roscrea for Landon Donovan's wife?</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>66 min:</strong> Belarus substitution: Vitali Rodionov on, Anton Putilo off. England substitution: Shaun Wright-Phillips on, Theo Walcott off.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>69 min:</strong> England substitution: Peter Crouch on, Emile Heskey off. Heskey's played very well tonight, having put on an exhibition of line-leading on the occasion of his 50th international cap. He limps to the bench and straps an ice-pack to his hamstring. Meanwhile on the touchline, David Beckham is still gadding about in his red bib.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>73 min:</strong> The substitutes Crouch and Wright-Phillips combine well to set up Wayne Rooney, who takes one touch too many before shooting straight at a defender from the edge of the penalty area.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Belarus 1-3 England (Rooney 74)</strong> A lovely goal for Rooney, who puts more distance between England and their hosts. Bridge played the ball in from the left wing, Rooney dummied and ran, enabling Gerrard to pick him out with a clipped pass. Under pressure from a defender just outside the six-yard box, Rooney adjusted his feet and took the ball around the defender in one fluid movement and slotted home. That's a marvellous goal.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>78 min:</strong> \"Having seen this bloke play against Vancouver Whitecaps, I think the best thing that could happen to Landon Donovan is that he stay right where he is,\" writes David Marriott. Belarus substitution: Kutuzov off, Strakhanovick on.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>80 min:</strong> \"Typical American lack of geography knowledge there, Bobby Otter can certainly keep that for himself,\" grumbles Oliver Pattenden, among others. \"Hampshire is a county and Jersey an island and Crown dependency. Backward as they may be, towns they are not. Also, does he think the Falklands are somehow America's to give? Bloody typical.\"</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>85 min:</strong> A long ball from David James prompts no end of confusion between the Belarus central defenders, Steven Gerrard sprints past them and on to the ball, takes it around the goalkeeper, clips it towards the gaping goal and ... rattles it off the upright. Oh Stevie ...</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>87 min:</strong> England substitution: Wayne Rooney off after a great display, David Beckham on for cap No107.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>88 min:</strong> \"Bloody typical Brit rubric,\" writes Paul Ashton in response to Oliver Pattenden. \"The suggestion was for UK to <em>offer</em> the Falklands.\" Well we all know they're not Argentina's to give away, that's for sure! Why don't you throw Bobby Otter the six counties as well, oppressors?</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>90+1 min: </strong> England corner, which Beckham takes. Nothing comes of it.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>90+4 min:</strong> Peep! Peep! Peep! The ref signals the end of the match with three sharp blasts of his shiny whistle, leaving England perched on top of Group 6 with 12 points out of 12. Elsewhere in the group, Croatia have swatted Andorra aside 4-0. This is the first time England have ever won their first four World Cup qualifiers, so expect no end of over-the-top rhetoric in tomorrow's papers about how they're the greatest team ever to set foot on a football pitch and are now a shoo-in to win the World Cup in South Africa in 2010. </p> <p>The fact of the matter is that, despite the scoreline, England were outclassed for much of tonight's game. Still, a win is a win is a win is a win and while it might be unfair to speculate, you can't help but feel that this - a tricky away fixture in eastern Europe in October - is exactly the sort of match England under McClaren would have made a complete pig's ear of and droppped points in. Despite their poor first-half performance tonight, there seemed little danger of England under Capello coming unstuck after the break.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>Last word tonight</strong> goes to Oliver Pattenden, who's prepared to admit he made a mistake. \"I do get the imperial endeavours of Britain and American confused sometimes,\" he writes. \"I am curious to know why Bobby wanted to give away a handful of 'blue' states and a Democrat candidate. Election rigging, now that is typically American.\"</p>",
  "<p>In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/125679/death.race\">Death Race</a>, there are people, and there are cars, and the two entities are really, really similar. People smash into people; cars smash into cars. Sometimes cars smash into people. I suppose there is a difference \u2013 the cars don't talk to each other, or spit in each other's food. But when the people in this film talk to each other, they might as well be revving their engines or honking their horns. There isn't very much character development.</p> <p>To be fair, there is a bit. There isn't absolutely none.</p> <p>The film is based on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/80959/death.race.2000\">Death Race 2000</a>, a movie made in the 1970s about a future dystopia in which people raced to the death. One interesting thing is that, in those days, people imagined that this particular dystopian future would take two and a half decades to arrive. But this version is set in 2012 \u2013 these days, we're much more impatient.</p> <p>I settled down in the cinema, which was about a quarter full, and sipped at my coffee. There was a sense that we were not expecting anything too great. </p> <p>In the film, Jason Statham is an ex-racing driver. He has stopped driving for, I think, some dark reason I didn't catch, possibly because there's a lot of background noise in this movie. Maybe he's killed somebody on the track. Maybe he's just \"lost it\". He's called Jensen Ames \u2013 named after the Jensen Interceptor, a classic sports car. He is lavishly, although not densely, tattooed \u2013 a tormented fighter rather than a heavy metal geek. He is \"cool\". He has no discernible emotions. There is nothing very complicated under the bonnet.</p> <p>Anyway, he gets put in prison.</p> <p>The dystopia is as follows. People in prison have a choice. They can either stay in prison or they can race to the death, in mad cars, and win their freedom. (At least, that's the deal offered by the prison's icy governess, played by Joan Allen. But is she being honest?) Meanwhile, these death races are America's most popular sport, with huge ratings, and the whole thing absolutely stinks with corruption. If you want a much more nuanced version of this type of thing \u2013 manly men, corrupt sport, and a sexy, bossy woman in charge \u2013 check out Oliver Stone's film about American football, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/82966/any.given.sunday\">Any Given Sunday</a>.</p> <p>But back to this film. What does Statham do? Of course, he decides to risk racing to the death. You'd think, as an ex-racing driver, he would jump at the chance, but he doesn't \u2013 he broods for a while. But then he decides that, yes, he'll race to the death. This is the bit of character development I mentioned earlier.</p> <p>Did I say that he's in prison having been framed for murdering his wife? Well, that's the situation. He minds about this, but not overly. Just like he minds when people try to kill him, but not overly. He is sentient. But barely. </p> <p>When he gets to prison, he somehow scores a woman straight from the pages of a lads' mag as his co-driver. Again, he seems neither pleased nor displeased.</p> <p>And then ... the races begin!</p> <p>For me, this is where the film loses its grip. You'd think that racing to the death would be pretty exciting, wouldn't you? But it's not. The reason for this is that you don't care who dies, because none of the characters seem to be alive in the first place. Still, there's a great deal of crashing, and people in grave danger, and people dying, and the vague, nagging worry that the Joan Allen character might not be telling the truth when she tells Statham that he'll go free if he wins the race.</p> <p>But you know what the scariest bit is? It's when someone spits in Statham's food. Which, I think, is pretty significant. Given that this is a film about racing to the death.</p>",
  "<p>Nobel prize-winner Orhan Pamuk, tried in 2005 under Turkish law for criticising the state, used his opening address at the Frankfurt Book Fair to decry the \"oppression\" of Turkey's writers.</p> <p>Speaking alongside Turkish president Abdullah G\u00fcl, Pamuk deplored how \"a century of banning and burning books, of throwing writers into prison or killing them or branding them as traitors and sending them into exile, and continuously denigrating them in the press\" has made Turkish literature poorer. </p> <p>Turkey is the country of honour at this week's Frankfurt Book Fair, and hundreds of Turkish writers and publishers have descended on the city to celebrate \"Turkey in all its colours\".</p> <p>In August 2005, Pamuk was charged with \"public denigration of Turkish identity\" under Article 301 of the penal code after he said in an interview with a Swiss newspaper that \"30,000 Kurds and a million Armenians were killed in these lands and nobody but me dares to talk about it\".</p> <p>The case against him was subsequently dropped, and Article 301 was amended earlier this year, but Pamuk said yesterday afternoon in Frankfurt that \"the state's habit of penalising writers and their books is still very much alive; Article 301 of the Turkish penal code continues to be used to silence and suppress many other writers, in the same way it was used against me; there are at this moment hundreds of writers and journalists being prosecuted and found guilty under this article.\"</p> <p>Turkish authors who have been tried under Article 301 include novelist Elif Shafak over a remark by a fictional character in her novel The Bastard of Istanbul referring to the Armenian massacre as genocide, and writer and journalist Perihan Magden, who said in her weekly magazine column that Turkey needed an alternative to compulsory military conscription. Both were acquitted. Publisher Ragip Zarakolu was convicted in June this year of having \"insulted the Turkish republic\" after publishing The Truth Will Set Us Free, which acknowledges the Armenian genocide.</p> <p>Pamuk called on the Turkish writers and publishers present at the fair, including Magden and Shafak as well as Asl\u0131 Erdogan and Sebnem Isig\u00fczel, to \"speak openly about [their] experiences over the past century\".</p> <p>\"Since they have come to Frankfurt to let the whole world hear their voices, it follows that we can shake off just a bit of our gloom about no one understanding us,\" he said, referring to his depression when starting out as a novelist over the lack of interest or understanding in Turkish writing in the west. \"Are we going to convince ourselves that our own culture and identity is unique, and then shut ourselves away, or are we going to value the richness of our cultural traditions and our own uniqueness while giving equal value to free expression?\" he asked.</p> <p>Pamuk said that while he was working on his novel Museum of Innocence, published earlier this year in Turkish, he needed to research old Turkish films and songs. He did this easily enough on YouTube, but after the site was banned in Turkey in 2007, he would no longer be able to do so. </p> <p>\"YouTube, like many other domestic and international websites, has been blocked for residents of Turkey for political reasons,\" Pamuk said. \"Those in whom the power of the state resides may take satisfaction from all these repressive measures, but we writers, publishers, artists feel differently, as do all other creators of Turkish culture and indeed everyone who takes an interest in it: oppression of this order does not reflect our ideas on the proper promotion of Turkish culture.\"</p> <p>But Pamuk said that despite the obstacles Turkish writers and publishers face, they have not let their spirits flag. \"Over the past 15 years, Turkish publishing has expanded at an astonishing rate; there are more books being published in Turkey than ever before, and in my view, Istanbul's vibrant book trade at last represents its rich and layered history,\" he said.</p> <p>\"When young writers coming from Turkey to Frankfurt see how large the world publishing industry is, I can well imagine that they will feel as empty and useless as I did. But when Turkey's young writers turn in on themselves to find the inner voices that will turn them into interesting writers, they will no longer need to succumb to dark thoughts like, 'No one would be interested in a Turkish writer anyway.' May the Frankfurt Book Fair bring hope and happiness to us all.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>10.30am Cannes time -</strong> There are a lot of weary faces around the Palais this morning after the toil of three heavy nights starts to kick in.<br>Last night was one of the biggest party nights here in Cannes, with a number of events going on. BBC Worldwide, together with Impossible Pictures, was promoting ITV1 drama <strong>Primeval</strong>, which it is selling here, with a cocktail party with a number of the cast members. I was told that the show is apparently bigger than CSI in South Korea. Who'd have known. Guests left with a goody bag containing a flying remote control dinosaur which will give EasyJet no end of worries on the journey back I'm sure.</p> <p><strong>Gok Wan</strong> was also in town to promote his new show Miss Naked Beauty at a party hosted by All3Media International and production company Maverick. Guests included Entourage star Adrian Grenier, who was only too happy to pose for pictures with the ladies. </p> <p>For those who witnessed Wan's opening turn at the MediaGuardian Edinburgh International TV Festival, you will be pleased to know that he managed to just about keep his potty mouth under control.</p> <p>Today is a broadband focused day here at Mipcom, with the first major event a keynote speech by You Tube founder <strong>Chad Hurley</strong>, who himself looked like he might have had a bit of a late one last night. He announced new partnership deals with Rai in Italy and Aardman in the UK, which will see more animation appear on the platform. The BBC's new director of future media and technology Erik Huggers is due to appear later.</p> <p><strong>10.45am -</strong> Scottish production company The Comedy Unit, part of the RDF Media Group, has released more details of its <strong>Rab C Nesbitt</strong> Christmas special - the first time the Govan philosopher will have been seen on the small screen in a decade.</p> <p>The 45 minute show for BBC2 will reunite the team that made Rab C Nesbitt a hit in the 1990s, with a script penned by Iain Pattison and Gregor Fisher reprising his role as Nesbitt. Elaine C Smith will return as Nesbitt's long-suffering wife Mary Doll while Tony Roper is back as Jamesie Cotter. </p> <p>New faces in the Christmas special include Gary Lewis, who has appeared in Billy Elliot and Gangs of New York, as Mary's old boyfriend Frank and Kathleen McDermott, whose credits include Wedding Belles, as Gash's new wife Lorna. </p> <p>\"For those waiting to find out what has been happening to the string-vested, armchair philosopher since he was last seen on the small screen, there'll be more than a few surprises in store as Rab's return will see him finding religion, sobriety, and even the cooker,\" a spokeswoman promises.</p> <p><strong>4.30pm -</strong> <strong>Erik Huggers</strong> was interviewed in a session at Mipcom today but didn't say much more than Guardian readers already know, following his <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/oct/13/bbc-microsoft\">interview with the media section on Monday</a>.</p> <p>He confirmed that a children's version of the iPlayer was in development and would launch soon, potentially before the end of the year. He also talked more about bringing the iPlayer to television sets through Freeview and said he wanted to see an open standard developed that could see other services get in on the act as well. However, he warned that road ahead on this one could be a long one with costs not even in the equation yet and permission still needed from the BBC Trust. \"There is a lot of technology that needs to come to bear to make this work in an open environment,\" he said.\"My best guess is that it is a year to a year and a half away if everything is approved.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>October 14 session</strong></p> <p><strong>Terrorism</strong><br>\"Another great plot\" is being investigated by the authorities, counter-terrorism minister Lord West warned. \"There is another great [terrorist] plot building up again and we are monitoring this,\" he told the Lords.</p> <p>Lord West revealed the existence of the plot in exchanges over the counter-terrorism bill but gave no more details of the threat. His warning came less than 24 hours after peers forced the government to abandon plans to extend maximum pre-charge detention for terror suspects to 42 days with the home secretary, Jacqui Smith, telling critics they were exposing the country to a greater risk.</p> <p><strong>Sats tests</strong><br>The government scrapped Sats tests for 14-year-olds in the wake of this year's marking fiasco. The schools secretary, Ed Balls, said parents would be kept informed of their child's progress through the use of US-style \"school report cards\". He set out his plans to \"radically reform\" the regime in secondary schools but insisted pupils at 11 would continue to sit externally-marked tests.</p> <p>The move was welcomed by the shadow schools secretary, Michael Gove, who promised to work with the government towards a system of \"fewer and more rigorous tests\". He said the \"fiasco\" this year, when thousands of Sats tests were marked late by contractor ETS, should never be repeated.</p> <p><strong>Failing banks</strong><br>The Tories pledged to help speed new laws onto the statute book to deal with failing banks in the wake of the credit crunch. The shadow chancellor, George Osborne, said Conservatives would do everything they could to help get the banking bill made law before next February, when special powers taken by the government after last year's run on Northern Rock expire.</p> <p>The chancellor, Alistair Darling, said that without the special powers he could not have dealt with more recent problems over Bradford and Bingley and the \"collapse\" of the Icelandic banks. \"It was essential to have these special powers. Otherwise we would have been in real difficulties,\" he said.</p> <p>The bill gives the Bank of England a statutory duty to promote financial stability, improves protection for depositors and provides new powers to deal with failing banks by transferring them to another private sector purchaser or bringing them into temporary public ownership.</p> <p><strong>George Osborne</strong><br>Osborne denied he had revealed details of private briefings from the Bank of England ahead of the bail-out package being announced. He said: \"Number 10 has been briefing against me for the last week while we have been trying to offer some cross-party support for what the prime minister has been doing. Let me make it absolutely clear: I did not take, nor did my colleagues on the front bench take, any private briefing from the Bank of England and go and repeat it on any television programme or in any newspaper article.\"</p> <p><strong>Investment advice given to councils</strong><br>The local government secretary, Hazel Blears, defended the investment advice given to councils with millions of pounds now tied up in failed Icelandic banks. She said the guidance issued by government was \"prudent and responsible\" and insisted councils which followed it would have made \"well-informed\" investment decisions.</p> <p>Blears said further talks would be held with the Local Government Association to \"try and identify the authorities who are struggling with these issues\". But none of the affected councils would \"struggle to meet their payroll bill\" and many had said there would be no impact on frontline services.</p> <p><strong>Interest rates</strong><br>The government was urged to tell the Bank of England to cut interest rates in an attempt to stave off a deep recession. Labour former Treasury chief secretary Lord Barnett said Darling and the prime minister, Gordon Brown, were already \"telling major banks what to do\". He called for the Treasury to tell the governor of the bank \"to cut interest rates in a big way - it is urgently needed.\"</p> <p><strong>Council housing</strong><br>Housing minister Margaret Beckett rejected calls for the government to embark on a new programme of council house building. Liberal Democrat Bob Russell (Colchester) protested that while ministers committed billions of pounds to bail out banks, hundreds of thousands of children had to live in unsuitable housing. But Beckett said extra accommodation did not have to just be provided in the form of council houses and expressed \"reluctance\" to see the scrapping of the right to buy.</p> <p><strong>Regional ministers</strong><br>Labour's Andrew Mackinlay (Thurrock) called on the government to explain the point of regional ministers. He said he \"genuinely\" did not know what they did and was angry they did not face question time. Prompting laughter with his insistence that he did not want to be \"unhelpful or unkind\", Mackinlay - who has never been given a government job - joked that he was starting to question where he was going wrong.<br>Blears replied: \"I might be forgiven for my heart sinking when you say you don't want to be difficult.\" But she added: \"You ask a very pertinent question and you are right that it's important that there is wider awareness of the role of regional ministers.\"</p>",
  "<p>One of the myriad joys of live <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/theatre\">theatre</a> is that you never get the same performance twice. And sometimes the little \u2013 or not so little \u2013 glitches are what make a show memorable.</p> <p>During last Thursday's performance of Flashdance at the <a href=\"http://www.theambassadors.com/newwimbledon/\">New Wimbledon Theatre</a>, one of the chorus dancers in the Act One finale lost a training shoe thanks to the high-energy Arlene Phillips choreography. There it sat, in the middle of the stage, while the routine went on around it. The dancer himself couldn't carry on with his solitary shoe, and sneaked off into the wings. It was at that point that the audience's collective eyes became glued to that trainer. We weren't listening to the vocals of <a href=\"http://www.victoriahamiltonbarritt.com/\">Victoria Hamilton-Barritt</a>, playing Alex; we weren't all that bothered about her inner dilemma about whether or not she'd <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashdance\">give up welding and go to that audition</a>. We wanted to know if anyone would do anything about that damned shoe.</p> <p>Enter <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/celebs-on-sunday/2007/10/21/interrogation-bruno-langley-98487-19960383/\">Bruno Langley</a>, playing off-the-rails Jimmy, for his short exchange of dialogue with Hamilton-Barritt before the curtain fell. He walked across the stage, picked up the trainer, and proceeded to do the rest of the scene with shoe in hand, carrying on with his normal arm movements regardless. Far from looking like the gun-toting bad boy, it looked like he was threatening to shy the shoe at all who crossed him. Full marks for bravery, though; where actors with more experience might have ignored the trainer until the end of the dialogue, actors with less courage might have not grabbed it at all. The dancer, freshly shod, crept back into the chorus line, and his entry, like Langley's exit, was met with huge cheers.</p> <p>Missed cues are commonplace, and always cringeworthy if you know they've happened. The last time I went to see <a href=\"http://www.palace-theatre-london.co.uk/\">Spamalot</a> was not long after <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2007/jul/28/broadcasting.tvandradio1\">Sanjeev Bhaskar</a> seized Excalibur and took over as King Arthur, and he and his colleagues proceeded to ad lib, mix up their entrances, corpse, and generally have a fabulous time. What made it brilliant was that the majority of the audience would have had no idea that what was unfolding in front of them wasn't what was scripted, because the very concept of a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/montypython/index.shtml\">Monty Python</a> musical allows for a certain amount of chaos. As long as you don't mess up the catchphrases, you're fine.</p> <p>Scenery mishaps are less frequent, but more noticeable. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2008/apr/23/theatre2\">Gone with the Wind</a>'s ridiculously elaborate revolving stage broke down regularly during its short tenure at the New London. You'd think they'd have got used to troubleshooting it and that the stage manager wouldn't swear loudly in anger, as he did when I witnessed the show being stopped for a good 20 minutes while they tried to get it working again. Embarrassing as these little difficulties may be, I am grateful I've not seen anyone hurt on stage \u2013 last year two actors were injured by a mechanical staircase while rehearsing for <a href=\"http://www.josephthemusical.com/\">Joseph</a>, and one of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2007/jun/20/theatre1\">Lord of the Rings</a> cast got his <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6707791.stm\">leg caught in hydraulics</a> during a performance.</p> <p>So what are your favourite musical stage disasters? Not dreadful shows (so the travesty that was William Baker's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2007/oct/16/theatre4\">Rent: Remixed</a> is out of the running) \u2013 mistakes, slips, accidents, anything unscripted that turned a normal night out into one of the most memorable musicals ever.</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/dundeeunited\">Dundee United</a> chairman Eddie Thompson died this morning after a long battle with prostate cancer. The club said they were \"devastated\" by the death of one of their most loyal backers who was \"a very close and inspirational friend\".</p> <p>United's weekend match against <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/rangers\">Rangers</a> has been postponed as a mark of respect. Scottish Premier League executive chairman Lex Gold described his death as \"a great loss to our game\" and the SPL confirmed Saturday's match at Ibrox would be rescheduled for a later date.</p> <p>Gold said: \"Eddie's incredible enthusiasm for Dundee United, the SPL and football in general made him an inspiration to many. He is a great loss to our game.\" The SPL also confirmed there would be one minute of applause for Thompson before all other top-flight games in Scotland this weekend.</p> <p>Thompson had been involved with Dundee United for over forty years as a supporter, chairman, backer and champion of the club's interests. He counted himself a fan as much as an administrator. A trained accountant, he began following United after he moved to Dundee in 1964 from his hometown Glasgow, and after a successful career in business, he acquired a majority shareholding of United in 2002 and invested millions of pounds of his own money into the club. Despite his illness, he continued to attend as many games as possible until very recently.</p> <p>He was once quoted as saying: \"You can change your wife, your house, your car, but you can never change your team. Chairmen come and go, boards come and go, but the fans remain. They are the one true constant.\"</p> <p>One of the stands at Tannadice was named after him earlier this year and thousands of Dundee United fans wore \"One Eddie Thompson\" T-shirts at this year's CIS Cup final. A statement from the Federation of Dundee United Supporters' Clubs added: \"We have lost a wonderful father figure whose massive physical, emotional and financial contribution will always be revered amongst us.</p> <p>\"The courage, bravery and devotion to our team shown by Eddie during the latter stages of his illness dispels the myth that there are no heroes anymore - Eddie Thompson is a hero to all of us.</p> <p>\"We are all heartbroken today. The heartfelt love and sympathy of every Dundee United FC supporter go out to Cath, Stephen, Justine and the family.\" </p> <p>The club said in a statement on their website: \"It is with great sadness that Dundee United announce the death of chairman Eddie Thompson, who died today after a long illness borne with great fortitude, much bravery and a dogged determination to carry out his responsibilities at Tannadice for as long as possible.\"</p> <p>Thompson was a champion of the smaller clubs in the Scottish Premier League and his former friends and colleagues have been paying warm tributes to his character and dedication.</p> <p>\"He fought for his club, he was so enthusiastic and so passionate,\" Motherwell chairman John Boyle told BBC Radio Scotland. \"He was an inspiration to us. There was absolutely no question that, as he said, he was the custodian for the fans.</p> <p>\"Dundee United went through a very, very turbulent time and he was a bit of stability for the club. They have achieved marvels in the last six or seven years, largely due to his influence. The players, the manager and the fans all looked up to him so much.</p> <p>Mike Barile, associate director of the Dundee United supporters' group Arab Trust and a close friend of Thompson, described him as \"just a lovely, lovely man\". Barile said: \"Eddie was so passionate about his football team, and through his hard work and determination he proved his doubters wrong and turned things around here.\"</p> <p>Scottish Football Association chief executive Gordon Smith said: \"Everyone at the Scottish FA is extremely saddened to hear about the passing of Dundee United chairman Eddie Thompson. You need only look at the way the fans reacted at the CIS Cup final earlier this year to see how much Dundee United meant to Eddie and how much Eddie meant to the club. He will be sorely missed.\" </p> <p>The news comes only three days after the death of his son-in-law Ken Mitchell, 38, who died in a motorcycle accident. Thompson is survived by his wife Cath, children Justine and Stephen and four grandchildren.</p>",
  "<p>American investigators have shut down an international criminal network they claim is responsible for up to a third of all spam email on the internet.</p> <p>After a protracted investigation between the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and police in other countries, courts in Illinois and New Zealand have frozen the assets of New Zealander Lance Atkinson and Texas-based Jody Smith. They are accused of making millions by bombarding people with emails offering illegal drugs and fake medical remedies.</p> <p>The duo are believed to be part of a well-known group of spammers known as the HerbalKing gang, who have sent enormous numbers of unwanted messages over the past three years.</p> <p>\"The defendants recruited spammers around the world to send billions of spam messages,\" the FTC said in a statement yesterday. \"Their enterprise included participants in Australia, New Zealand, China, Russia, Canada and the United States.\"</p> <p>According to FTC officials, Atkinson and Smith used spam emails to promote drugs for sexual dysfunction, penis enlargement and weight loss \u2013 all of which were sold without a licence or did not live up to the claims made.</p> <p>The duo are believed to have used a string of up to 35,000 hacked computers around the world \u2013 known as a botnet \u2013 to send up to 10 billion spam messages a day. As many as three million complaints had been made about their messages.</p> <p>Documents filed in the case name the pair, as well as four companies they control, and accused them of clearing as much as $400,000 in Visa charges alone in a month. A sequence of injunctions and restraining orders prevent them from continuing to do business while the case is underway.</p> <p>According to the campaigning organisation Spamhaus, HerbalKing is an \"infamous\" group that has been operating since at least 2005, which was ranked as the most prolific spam gang on the internet last year.</p> <p>Both Smith and Atkinson - along with his brother Shane - are well-known spammers, and have been involved previously in cases brought under America's CAN-SPAM act, which makes it illegal to send large amounts of unsolicited email in this way.</p> <p>Three years ago Atkinson was fined $2.2m after he was found guilty of running a similar programme marketing herbal products over email.<br>The news marks the latest in a string of cases brought by US federal investigators against spam marketers</p> <p>Earlier this year Robert Soloway, from Seattle, was sentenced to 47 months in prison and ordered to repay $700,000 which he had taken as a result of his activities.</p> <p>And this summer notorious spammer Sanford Wallace \u2013 known as \"Spamford\" \u2013 was fined a record $230m for attacking MySpace users and using the social networking site to send porn spam to millions of users.</p> <p>Although spam is usually most associated with clumsy attempts to sell unwanted goods, one official said that the spammers had improved their methods of attack in order to carry on fooling people.</p> <p>\"These sites are really professionally constructed,\" Steve Baker, the FTC's Midwest Region director, told the Associated Press. \"Some years ago you used to be able to tell the bogus things because they looked cheesy and had misspellings. I don't think that's true anymore.\"</p> <p>Other experts warned that other spammers would be likely to take the place of the HerbalKing gang immediately.</p> <p>\"Anyone hoping that they might find less spam in their email tomorrow morning is probably going to be in for a disappointment,\" said Graham Cluley, senior technology consultant at internet security company Sophos.</p> <p>\"It's unlikely that action like this is going to result in a dramatic drop in the amount of spam you encounter \u2013 but the more action that is taken to crack down on criminal spammers, the better for all of us.\"</p>",
  "<p>Exactly 50 years ago today, the legendary American journalist <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_R._Murrow\">Edward R Murrow</a> stood up in front of the cream of American network television and warned them of the consequences for serious journalism if broadcasters were not prepared to \"get up off our fat surpluses\". </p> <p>Murrow's <a href=\"http://www.rtnda.org/pages/media_items/edward-r.-murrow-speech998.php\">impassioned plea on October 15 1958</a> was powerful enough for <strong>George Clooney</strong> to turn it into the opening sequence of his movie <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0433383/\">Goodnight \u2026 and Good Luck</a>. And reading it 50 years on, it still has an uncanny resonance for the future of broadcast journalism.<br><br>This instrument - television - said Murrow, \"can teach, it can illuminate; yes, and it can even inspire. But it can do so only to the extent that humans are determined to use it to those ends. Otherwise it is merely wires and lights in a box\". </p> <p>Murrow understood the extraordinary potential of television as a force for enlightenment. But he also understood that, left to its own devices, it would drive journalism down a vacuous black hole. </p> <p>Over there, no-one listened. From the early 80s, the economics of news shifted dramatically. Competition for on-screen talent escalated. Cable news channels started making inroads. The big corporations took over. </p> <p>And news became part of a bitter ratings war, as network bulletins turned away from anything serious, foreign or challenging in favour of a crude audience-grabbing agenda: gory crimes, celebrity divorces, disasters with dramatic pictures, the trivial and the bizarre. </p> <p>Without any regulatory obligations for quality, investment or scheduling, network news divisions could only move in one direction: downwards. Today, some of America's most dedicated TV practitioners rail against the descent of network news into market-driven celebrity, senationalism and trivia. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the US media regulator, the Federal Communications Commission, stands aloof watching the carnage, described by one network news executive as \"toothless and gutless\".</p> <p>Over here, we travelled a different route. Within a few months of going on air in 1955, the ITV companies faced financial difficulties and unilaterally cut money and time from the channel's nascent news service, ITN. The Independent Television Authority, our first TV regulator, stepped in and demanded a daily minimum of 20 minutes' peak-time news. </p> <p>Ten years later, in 1967, the regulator ordered an experimental extension to 30 minutes, then insisted in the face of bitter opposition from ITV that this should continue for another year \u2013 and so regulation paved the way for News at Ten as an authoritative competitor to BBC news for the best part of 30 years. </p> <p>In 1982, Channel 4's first chief executive, <strong>Jeremy Isaacs</strong>, constructed a new editorial vision for television news out of the channel's statutory remit to be different. No crime, disaster, or Royal Family stories - but an agenda of politics, the City, science, technology, and the arts with lashings of foreign news. For one hour in the middle of peak time. A framework laid down in law promoted a serious approach to television news that has survived to the present day, watched regularly by more than 1 million viewers. </p> <p>Even when <strong>Margaret Thatcher</strong> bequeathed a \"light touch\" regulator in 1990, the Independent Television Commission, it took two attempts for the newly liberated ITV companies to be allowed to move News at Ten - a move they subsequently regretted.</p> <p>And despite the rhetoric of deregulation, the 2003 Communications Act maintained obligations for national and international news in peak time on the commercial public service broadcasters, even adding that ITV's service should be properly funded. While the ITC's successor Ofcom's position on regional news may be shaken by ITV's pleas of poverty, its defence of the main news bulletins has - so far - remained robust. </p> <p>Regulation may be coming back into fashion in the banking industry, but its virtues bear repeating in broadcast journalism as Channel 4 seeks public subsidy and ITV cannot even guarantee that it will be doing news in 10 years time. </p> <p>Fifty years after Murrow's speech, this may be the time to dust down his words and shout them out again; because the forces that turned American television journalism into another branch of showbusiness are gathering steam over here.<br><em><br><a href=\"http://www.wmin.ac.uk/mad/page-1603\">Steven Barnett</a> is professor of communications at the University of Westminster.
