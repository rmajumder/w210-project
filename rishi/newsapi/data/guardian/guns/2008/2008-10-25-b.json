  "<p>Michel Platini is casting doubt on whether <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/england\">England</a> will ever be able to win a World Cup again, because there are so few English players in the later stages of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/championsleague\">Champions League</a>. Check out the full interview in today's Observer Sport Monthly, just in case you think I am making this up. </p> <p>If we take the Uefa president's statement at face value, instead of dismissing it as the latest in a series of increasingly barmy sideswipes at the runaway success of the Premier League, then there are two points with which to take issue. </p> <p>The first is that the Champions League may not be a reliable guide to the outcome of an international tournament. Just because Uefa regard their sacred cash-cow as the sexiest thing on the planet does not mean the rest of us have to fall for the hype. Arsenal were beaten at home by Hull in the dull, predictable, debt-ridden, money-dominated Premier League Platini so obviously despises, yet when they jetted out to play the runners-up in the Turkish league last week they scored five goals away from home and Manuel Almunia said: 'Everything seemed much easier than normal.'</p> <p>Perhaps mismatches are to be expected in the early stages of a knockout competition, though Platini ought to be concerned that results such as Fenerbahce 2 Arsenal 5, and Basel 0 Barcelona 5 do rather explode the myth of the grandly titled Champions League. And Almunia's comments certainly chime with what most English viewers feel about Uefa's absurdly protracted coronation process. The Champions League is not quite as bloated as it used to be, but it is still boring as hell before Christmas and even in its later stages only gets exciting when English clubs play each other or face Barcelona or one of the teams from Milan.</p> <p>If Platini really thinks spectators in England are dazzled by what they see on midweek matchdays and turned off by a money-driven version of football monopoly at weekends, then he has things the wrong way round. And if English football has become more stratified than many of us would like, with the same few teams finishing at the top and sharing the prizes each year, then instead of debt, foreign ownership, imported managers and overseas players, it would be interesting to hear Platini's opinion of the corrosive effect the Champions League itself has had on competition within domestic leagues. </p> <p>Yet none of this is new. What is new is the assertion that to win a World Cup you must be well represented in the latter stages of the Champions League. Someone had better tell Germany, who beyond the quarter-finals last season were represented only by Michael Ballack. Or Brazil, who supplied only F\u00e1bio Aur\u00e9lio to the last four until Anderson and Juliano Belletti appeared in the 120th minute in Moscow to take penalties. </p> <p>Meanwhile, there were 13 English players on show when the Champions League reached the last-four stage, a figure that could have been higher still had Gary Neville, Peter Crouch or Wayne Bridge played any part. This is the second problem with Platini's argument, the bit where it falls down completely. There were more English players in the later stages of last season's Champions League than any other nationality, even allowing for the fact that Paul Scholes and Jamie Carragher have voluntarily ended their international careers. So if one were to go along with Platini's distorted logic England should actually be favourites for the next World Cup. </p> <p>The point could be made, and perhaps should be, that 13 players represents a fairly thin return when three of the last four clubs in Europe were English. If Platini is arguing there are not enough English players in most English sides, then most people could agree, but why pick on England? Barcelona, the only non-English semi-finalists, fielded four Spanish players. There were four Germans in Bayern Munich's starting line-up on Tuesday and five Italians in Fiorentina's. Perhaps in a perfect world we could all be like AC Milan, who won the European Cup in Athens last year with nine Italians on the pitch plus an Italian manager on the touchline, but hasn't the same club just opened negotiations with David Beckham? </p> <p>To some extent the nationality issue is a red herring anyway. Uefa have more things to worry about than England's World Cup prospects. When Juventus, Platini's old team, played Real Madrid last week, just 25,813 turned up to watch in a stadium that only holds 27,500. There were almost as many at Norwich v Wolves in the Championship on the same evening, and the Carrow Road crowd was treated to seven goals and an unexpected result. The Stadio Olimpico spectators were treated, if that is the word, to Premier League cast-offs Alex Manninger, Olof Mellberg and Momo Sissoko (all Juventus) and Gabriel Heinze, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Arjen Robben (Real Madrid). The situation in Turin may improve if the Stadio delle Alpi ever comes back on stream, not that Juve fans are exactly pining for an unloved white elephant, but the underlying message is clear. Juventus v Real Madrid would once have been a fixture to stir the blood, a meeting of dynasties fit to grace a European Cup final. Now it is reduced to something less spectacular than the Premier League can supply most weekends. No wonder Platini is wary of Richard Scudamore. </p> <p>The Frenchman says, however, that his nightmare scenario for English football is that soon there will be no English players and no English managers, just foreign speculators. One doubts whether this will come to pass, given that some foreign speculators as well a few English ones are finding the going much harder than they had anticipated, but even were it to happen would it be as bad as the recent corruption scandal in Italy, Lyon winning the French title seven years in a row or Real Madrid's mountain of debt being wiped out through a crafty deal with the Spanish government? </p> <p>Not everything in England is wonderful, but not everything under Uefa's control is all that great either. The reason Platini keeps banging on about England instead of attending to matters elsewhere is because now most of the money, the players and the excitement in world football is buzzing around the Premier League, a fundamental flaw in Uefa's own competition is being ever more glaringly exposed. Namely, that the Champions League exists to preserve the status quo. It is not an instrument for change, its whole purpose is to keep making money for the teams already in it. </p> <p>Uefa had no problem with English teams when, post-Heysel, they were struggling to catch up with European standards and regularly being taught a lesson by Champions League opponents. Now they have caught up to the extent of dominating the Champions League's later stages and even finding the early parts easy in comparison with the exacting nature of their domestic league - compare the trouble Liverpool had with Wigan at home last Saturday with the way they hit their stride early away to Atl\u00e9tico Madrid - Platini can find no obvious way of restoring the balance. Because there isn't one. Clubs outside the Champions League have been making the same complaint for years. The system is loaded in favour of those already at the top. That's no one's fault but your own, Michel. And, by the way, if England make it to South Africa they are perfectly capable of winning the World Cup. Thanks for all the extra motivation.</p> <h2>Bentley bluster leaves Ramos exposed</h2> <p>Juande Ramos can drop David Bentley for making unhelpful remarks about <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/tottenhamhotspur\">Spurs'</a> start to the season if he likes, or he can stand by him in public and rebuke him severely in private. </p> <p>What he can't really get away with is banishing the player without explanation against Udinese and then saying he was unaware of Bentley's comments in the first place. That just lends credence to Jonathan Woodgate's observation that Tottenham are rudderless at the moment, and makes it look as if Ramos might be part of the problem rather than the eventual solution. A bit like the chairman of cricket selectors who was once informed, politely and respectfully, that the players felt he was out of touch. 'Really?' he replied. 'I haven't heard that.' </p> <h2>Say it ain't so, Jos\u00e9</h2> <p>Didier Drogba can't be a diver or a con man. Everyone knows he was about to punch Nemanja Vidic in the Champions League final, but thought better of it. Even the FA have let him off his self-confessed thought crime. Presumably because they just didn't believe him.</p>",
  "<p>It is easy to kick a man while he is down. But there has been something about Juande Ramos's body language that makes it even easier. As the goals have hurtled past Heurelho Gomes in recent weeks, as the red cards have mounted, as the penalties have been surrendered, in fact every time there is reason to rail against the footballing gods, Ramos has continued to produce the same non-reaction.</p> <p>Arms folded. Lips pursed. Could he have been any more passive? Will he have greeted his dismissal with a noncommital shrug? Does his assistant, Gus Poyet, have a monopoly on facial expressions? Did the outgoing manager honestly think that his players would respond to adversity, starting against Bolton today, when they had seen nothing from their boss to spark them? Tottenham needed Ramos to show a touch of the Joe Kinnears. But he has, for weeks, looked like a man needing to be put out of his misery.</p> <p>Ramos is not the first Premier League manager this season to find himself caught up in a nightmare not entirely of his own making. Alan Curbishley and Kevin Keegan had reason to feel -similarly exposed by bad decision-making from above. Both effectively fell victim to a director of football. Both refused to accept unwanted meddling with the squad from on high. Both walked. Now Ramos has gone, too.</p> <p>But there is a fundamental difference between Ramos's attitude towards his director of football and that of Curbishley or Keegan. He should not have been surprised by the way his squad was reshaped in the summer. The Spaniard has known little else. At every club in La Liga, deals are cut without much input from the coach. Rafael Ben\u00edtez summed it up famously in his Valencia days when he was presented with completely the wrong type of squad reinforcements. 'I asked for a sofa,' he said. 'And they bought me a lampshade.'</p> <p>Such practice is common throughout Europe. No Italian coach expects much say in who comes and goes during a transfer window. They can ask for a new player to fill a specific position and then the general manager or sporting -director - someone with the ear of the club president - will do the rest. Ask yourself whether Carlo Ancelotti really asked for David Beckham to strengthen AC Milan, or whether it was their chief trader, vice-president Adriano Galliani, who thought it was a bright idea.</p> <p>When Ramos launched his reputation at Sevilla he was immensely fortunate to link up with one of the finest directors of football in the business. Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez Verdejo, known everywhere as 'Monchi', oversees a team of 700 scouts across the world and sees it as his mission to unearth a diamond before any of Europe's superclubs have even started digging. Monchi delivered a load of outstanding players to Ramos. Stars-in-the-making also came from within, such as Spain's classy defender Sergio Ramos, now with Real Madrid, and skilled winger Jes\u00fas Navas. They also came from Brazil in the form of flying full-back Daniel Alves, who has moved on to Barcelona, and prodigious scorer Luis Fabiano. They came from wherever Monchi found competitively-priced quality. Sevilla not only won silverware with the squad Monchi hand-picked, they also earned a fortune in selling on their discoveries at a massive mark-up.</p> <p>'We have shown we're really good at buying and selling to our own advantage,' said Monchi. 'We want to be stable and balanced but also to stay high in the football elite. The key to that is not only signing well, but having a great youth policy so that if one day the results stop coming we don't have to go out and spend millions of euros.'</p> <p>Perhaps when Tottenham went hunting for salvation in Seville they picked the wrong guy. Maybe it was Monchi, and not Ramos, who was the man they really needed to break the cycle of failed attempts that has prevented them from making any lasting improvements.</p> <p>Tottenham thought they were being progressive when they introduced the continental-style director of football model. When club chairman Daniel Levy presented his dream team of Danish talent-spotter Frank Arnesen and French coach Jacques Santini in the summer of 2004, he proudly claimed it was 'the direct result of a comprehensive review of the football side of the club,' adding: 'We now have a coaching set-up in place that has experience in several different countries and an extensive knowledge of players across the world.'</p> <p>Unfortunately, the pair did not have decent lines of communication or much regard for one another, so that particular partnership dissolved after 13 games.</p> <p>The director of football role currently belonging to Damien Comolli has been a soft target for the critics seeking an explanation for Tottenham's calamitous start to this season. There is no doubt that Comolli flunked last summer, leaving the team short of goal scorers, gumption and leadership. In time, some of his signings might turn out to be good ones, but few expect him to be around to see it.</p> <p>Jamie Redknapp, a former Spurs captain, is a fierce critic of the continental model. 'Directors of football don't work in this country,' he said. 'They need to rethink it. They had David Pleat when I was at Tottenham and all you get is people undermining the manager. Unless the manager and director of football are close then it won't work.'</p> <p>His father, after his experiences with Velimir Zajec and Avram Grant, not to mention Clive Woodward, probably has equally strong views on the subject. So when he takes charge at White Hart Lane this week, it could be time for another 'comprehensive review of the football side of the club'.</p> <p>On Redknapp Jnr's last point hinges the whole debate. Of course the system can work in England. Jose Mourinho won titles at Chelsea even though he did not choose all the new signings. Across Europe there are numerous examples of clubs who flourish under the system, and others who flounder because of friction between the man who spends and the man who coaches. Take Paris Saint-Germain. Coach Paul Le Guen spent all summer asking for a young striker from Rennes, Jimmy -Briand. The businessmen preferred to take Mateja Kezman from Fenerbahce. Now Kezman is on the bench, and Le Guen and the businessmen are at loggerheads.</p> <p>Ars\u00e9ne Wenger, who once employed Comolli as a scout, is adamant that the structure is not to blame. 'Anything can work in football as long as the responsibilities are clear and accepted by everybody,' he said. Is it just coincidence that Tottenham, Newcastle and West Ham - the three clubs where the coach has most obviously struggled for control - have had the biggest upheaval this season?</p> <p>Clearly Ramos was not able to generate the passion necessary to turn Tottenham's dismal form around. Gomes, the goalkeeper blamed by the manager for the most recent defeat at Udinese, was the latest player to have spoken about dwindling confidence.</p> <p>'The game can be lost in your head,' he admitted. 'We are lacking in confidence. I can understand the fans' frustration - if I were a supporter I would also be desperate to see my team win the matches. It is a difficult moment for us right now. We are not scoring the first goal in a game, this is the problem. We have to show more initiative. We train well every day but on a match day I do not know why this has happened.'</p> <p>Ramos, Comolli and Levy do not appear to know either. Time for a change.</p>",
  "<p>Turn on the TV these days and it's all <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/creditcrunch\">credit crunch</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/recession\">recession</a>. I've had to get used to the FTSE 100 index running across the bottom of my screen and like everyone else I can't help thinking, 'What the bloody hell is going on?'</p> <p>People might think that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/premierleague\">Premier League</a> footballers have little to worry about, tucked up in their recession-proof castles, but that's not quite true. Just like the rest of the population we have our concerns. Footballers rely on a healthy banking industry. Our careers are short and what we put away during our playing days is relied upon for our future. In the current financial climate I've heard of at least one footballer rushing back to his native country to check on his finances and one international even suggested burying his savings under his house.</p> <p>While that sounds a bit extreme (and I don't think it was an altogether serious suggestion), it's clear that the banking crisis affects footballers, even if it isn't yet affecting the finances of the game as a whole. </p> <p>It's too early to tell whether that will happen or not, with football being touted by the experts as 'recession- resilient if not recession-proof'. TV contracts account for around half of the Premier League's income and they have two or three years left to run before they are renegotiated. Gate receipts don't seem to be suffering and we will only know how season ticket renewals will be affected when they go on sale again in June. I would suggest that cup games are more of a concern. We had a reduced attendance at Braga last week and for some clubs the Uefa Cup could end up as a poisoned chalice if the team don't survive the preliminary rounds. That would mean a lot of expenditure for not much reward. </p> <p>Whenever people bring up the subject of cost-cutting in football, predictably it's players' wages that are first on the chopping block. For some clubs it's already a reality, with Grays Athletic in the Blue Square Premier having cut their players' wages by 50 per cent, as reported in last week's Observer. Their sponsors were cutting back - a development that will worry many of our smaller clubs. </p> <p>Footballers' wages have always been a contentious area of debate and, as a beneficiary of high rates of pay, my own opinions are divided. In the past, I have suggested footballers should have some kind of performance-related pay - which didn't go down too well with my peers. I am not suggesting bonuses for goals scored, or clean sheets kept - football is about teamwork not individual achievements. But this culture of footballers' pay packets and keeping up with the Joneses, with star players quibbling over contract clauses to guarantee parity of income with their team-mates, is unhealthy for the game and encourages overspending. If a club can afford to splash out on wages then fair enough, but if the club end up in hot water because of their wage bill then something is very wrong. </p> <p>It is difficult to imagine financial meltdown in the top flight, even though there are isolated cases of financial problems. West Ham lost their shirt sponsors when XL went bust last month, and Newcastle have struggled to sell out their games, putting tickets on public sale to walk-in supporters for the first time in many years. Some may say that has more to do with the football they've been playing and the results they're getting. To add insult to injury, Newcastle are probably right up there with the top spenders on wages, without any great effect on the pitch. Perhaps it's time for them to adopt a new business strategy. </p> <p>What has kept us all going - so far - is the loyalty of the fans. This is where football is really blessed. While other businesses rely on a handful of customers to keep them afloat, football has millions and that helps to spread the risk around. Predictions are that unless there is mass unemployment, football fans will hold on to their season tickets. I had a cleaner at my old house up in Liverpool and I remember her saying she had taken out a four-year loan just to buy a season ticket to Anfield for her son. The loyalty of football supporters is extraordinary and testament to the game's power.</p> <p>Clubs would do well to remember this and repay their fans' loyalty in other ways. I'm a big supporter of football kits as value for money, but perhaps we could go one season without a new kit. Or next year's season tickets could be held at this season's prices. Football is as popular as ever, but crash-proof? Only someone who lived in a bubble could think that. </p> <p><em>David James has donated his fee for this column to charity</em></p>",
  "<p>No sport delivers its participants more contrasting emotions than boxing: elation, fear, relief, pride, despair. And no boxing brothers, surely, have experienced those feelings with as much relentless intensity as have Gilbert and Howard Eastman. </p> <p>A little over a week ago, Gilbert was a fit, proud, professional boxer. Today, his career finished, his life saved by the genius of doctors and nurses at the Royal London Hospital, he will be happy, at 35, that he is able to move and to talk. </p> <p>Howard was always the 'big brother' - protective, confident, assertive. When he was 15, two years older than Gilbert, his father kicked him out of the family home in south London. He survived by begging in the streets and catching late-night tube trains to keep warm in winter, while honing his considerable fighting instinct in and out of the ring - and looking out for Gilbert. </p> <p>Howard once told me: 'There's a whole part of my life you'd never want to know about.' </p> <p>Gilbert, quieter but no less determined, was a pretty decent boxer. He certainly was a smooth mover with a good punch but, while many say he had more natural talent than Howard, he looked more vulnerable. </p> <p>Howard fought for the world middleweight title twice. He should have beaten the American William Joppy in his first challenge eight years ago; he had him down in the first round but did not press his advantage enough over the 12 rounds and was unlucky to lose on a majority decision. He was certainly more justified in questioning the judges than was Bernard Hopkins when losing to Joe Calzaghe earlier this year. </p> <p>But Eastman could not complain about being outsmarted in 2005 by the master boxer Hopkins. He had two grabs at glory, and fell short each time. For a proud man convinced he was good enough to be a world champion, it must have been hard to take. </p> <p>Gilbert challenged for the Commonwealth light-middleweight title nine years ago and gave a good account of himself against the tough Ghanaian Kofi Jantuah. Apart from one early-career stoppage, Jantuah lost only to world champions Kassim Ouma and Arthur Abraham in title fights, so Eastman moved in respectable company. </p> <p>But he lacked Howard's physical hardness. Gary Lockett stopped him in the first round to win the vacant WBU title in March 2006. Two months later, the rising Gary Woolcombe handed him his fourth defeat inside the distance and Gilbert had his licence suspended. His boxing career looked over. Then, against all expectations, he returned to the ring last February and laboured to a points defeat against the inexperienced George Katsimpas. </p> <p>Two Fridays ago at York Hall in Bethnal Green, Gilbert was stopped for the fifth time in a career that began in 1996, in the eighth and final round of his undercard bout against young Sam Webb from Kent. There was no title on the line. Gilbert's time had long passed, Sam's is yet to come. They were two honest pros earning a living some distance from the limelight. The fight didn't even make the cut for television, which resulted in minimal media coverage the following day. </p> <p>If the bout had been televised, if Gilbert had a higher profile than a one-time prospect making a comeback, you can be sure the abolitionists would have been out in force. As it is, he has been able to recover in relative peace, a blessing of sorts.</p> <p>Eastman walked unaided from the ring but collapsed in the dressing room and was taken to the Royal London, his one lucky break of the night. It is where John Sutcliffe and Peter Hamlyn, two of the best surgeons in the country, have operated on several injured boxers, notably Michael Watson and Gerald McClellan. </p> <p>According to friends who have been posting on boxing message boards all week, Gilbert is more than a fighter who didn't quite make it. He is also 'a true gent', a 'good, quiet man', 'one of the nicest blokes you could ever wish to meet'. </p> <p>Those sentiments seem well founded. </p> <p>Robert Smith, the new secretary of the British Boxing Board of Control and a former fighter himself, was among many members of the fight community to visit Gilbert during the week. The good news is, says Smith, Eastman is talking, walking, joking and looking forward to a well monitored recovery in the best place he could be. </p> <p>The other players in the Eastman saga have moved on, meeting their own successes and disappointments.</p> <p>Woolcombe has won four and lost two since he fought Gilbert, the last bout a bad knockout by Ryan Rhodes at York Hall in April. </p> <p>Lockett, never in love with boxing, has retired to run businesses in south Wales after being outclassed by the then unbeaten world middleweight champion Kelly Pavlik, in Atlantic City in June.</p> <p>Hopkins, 44 in January, then derailed Pavlik's progress in the same city last weekend in the performance of his career and is begging now for a rematch with Calzaghe or Roy Jones Jr.</p> <p>Howard? Three years after losing to Hopkins, he is still fighting. He is 37 and unlikely to get another crack at a world title, but it is what he does. Last night in Guyana, the country he and Gilbert left for London when wide-eyed little boys, he was scheduled to defend the national middleweight title he won on a majority decision over Denny Dalton in July. His challenger, Andrew 'Six Heads' Lewis, a once-feared puncher, has held two versions of the world welterweight title but has started to lose - most farcically two years ago against Dalton, when he had to retire to go the toilet. </p> <p>There are no laughs in boxing for Howard, though. He has been earning a living from the sport for 14 years and never considers the prospect of losing. But five of his six career losses have come in his past eight fights. A win over Six Heads will encourage him to continue.</p> <h2>Come on Australia, give the blond spinning top one more twirl</h2> <p>There is one former England player who will be smiling more than anyone else over Australia's lingering dilemma: how do you replace Shane Warne (right)? </p> <p>After they had won the first Test of the 2005 Ashes tour, Australia were expected to go on and give England a ritual drubbing in the series. After all, they had Warne and England had... the King of Spain.</p> <p>Ashley Giles, who'd had a fair year, came in for terrible stick after an ordinary contribution at Lord's. He wasn't needed in Australia's first innings collapse, went wicketless for 56 in 11 overs in their second and got a duck when England were bowled out for 180. Warne hit 28 at nearly a run a ball and took six wickets in the match. </p> <p>Wounded, Giles wrote at the time in The Guardian: 'Perhaps one day we will find [an English Warne]. But we haven't. And, that being the case, whether people like it or not, I still think I'm the best man for the job.' </p> <p>He was right, as he proved in the rest of the series, and, if he still had a newspaper column or Andrew Hilditch's phone number in India, he could remind the Australian chairman of selectors of that fact of life. </p> <p>When I wrote here a few weeks ago that Australia would struggle against India's still potent middle-order without a proven front-line spinner, the notion that Warne would be considered for a recall at 39 either as an emergency replacement or before the Ashes tour next summer seemed fanciful. But that is the buzz in Australia. </p> <p>Despite Australia's failure to press their advantage in Bangalore and their capitulation in Mohali, it still smacks of desperation to turn to the old guy - even if the spinning alternatives for the third Test in Delhi this week are to continue with Cameron 'Wide Boy' White or give Jason 'Krazy' Krejza his first cap. </p> <p>And yet, as Giles and everyone else knows, there is only one Warne (a small blessing for which nurses' quarters and lap-dancing emporiums everywhere should be grateful). There is no doubt Warne on half-throttle is more menacing than White or Krejza will ever be, but pride, stubbornness and the suspicion that he will turn a comeback into a three-ring circus will not allow the selectors to make the call. </p> <p>It's a shame. He would light up the next English summer, one final blaze of blond brilliance. And who knows? He might be so over the hill he gets a total thrashing.</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives\">Conservative party</a> faced demands last night to repay a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/partyfunding\">huge loan</a> from a member of the Rothschild banking family made through a company set up with the sole purpose of protecting her anonymity.</p> <p>An Observer investigation has found that the party has benefited from a \u00a31m loan from Lady Victoria de Rothschild, made via a 'non-trading' company that conducts no business and has had no other function in its four-year history than to lend the Tories money.</p> <p>Documents filed with the Electoral Commission show the party received the loan for \u00a31,014,000 from a company called Ironmade Ltd on 1 June 2005 and is not due to pay it off until 2010.</p> <p>Ironmade's accounts reveal the firm has been dormant since it was created in April 2005. According to the accounts, 'the ultimate controlling party of the company is Victoria, Lady de Rothschild, by virtue of her control of the entire issued share capital'. Prior to the loan, de Rothschild gave the party almost \u00a3130,000 via a series of donations made between 2002 and 2005 under her own name.</p> <p>Legislation barring anonymous loans, and those from non-trading companies, was introduced in 2006, after the de Rothschild loan was made, so the Tories can legitimately claim all parties were acting within the law.</p> <p>Some of the loan is understood to have been repaid this year. But the party's decision to continue the loan arrangement after the 2006 law change is an embarrassment as it attempts to shrug off the latest row over funding. Last week party officials said they accepted money only from 'legitimate UK trading companies'.</p> <p>Denis MacShane, Labour MP for Rotherham, called for the loan to be repaid. 'David Cameron is showing a contempt for British democracy's rules on party financing,' MacShane said. 'If they had an ounce of integrity left, they would only work within the law as it stands.'</p> <p>Lord Bell, de Rothschild's spokesman, said his client, a former Conservative party treasurer once married to the financier Sir Evelyn de Rothschild, asked her secretary and solicitor to be the company secretary and director so she would 'not be bothered by journalists'. 'At the time she made the loan, it was absolutely proper and legal for her to do so,' Bell said. 'She was subsequently questioned by police about the loan as part of the \"cash for honours\" investigation and was cleared of any wrongdoing. The loan she made was approved by Lord Marland'. Marland was then treasurer of the party.</p> <p>The revelation comes amid a fierce row triggered by allegations the shadow Chancellor, George Osborne, discussed with the Tories' chief fundraiser, Andrew Feldman, a possible donation from Oleg Deripaska, after meeting the Russian billionaire on his yacht in Corfu last summer.</p> <p>As the toxic row threatened to spill into its second week, Lord Mandelson, the Business Secretary, who also spent time on Deripaska's yacht, yesterday admitted meeting the oligarch two years earlier than previously revealed. European Commission officials had said the two had met socially in 2006 and 2007. But, in a letter to the Times, Mandelson said they first met in 2004. He accepts people may have been misled by a statement issued by his officials.</p> <p>Senior Tories suggested Osborne will in future remove himself from discussions about donations. But the party's attempts to deflect mounting interest in its finances is unlikely to be helped by the revelation of the de Rothschild loan.</p> <p>Bell said last night: 'I don't think it's a secret loan,' he said. 'It's not that difficult to find out who is behind it. It just requires a little bit more work by an investigator.'</p> <p>Asked to comment on the firm's nontrading status, Elizabeth Alexander, Ironmade's company secretary since May 2005, said: 'Talk to the others' and hung up. David Catchpole, who resigned as a director of the company in June 2008, said: 'I can't discuss any of that. I am not employed by my former company any more or the client.'</p> <p>A spokesman for the Tories said: 'The loan is fully declared to the Electoral Commission and permissible under the rules as they stood at the time and remains fully permissible now.'</p> <p>Interest in Tory party funding was renewed last week following the extraordinary spat between Osborne and another member of the Rothschild family, Nat, a distant cousin of Lady Victoria. Nat Rothschild, a hedge-fund manager, blames Osborne for leaking embarrassing details about his friend Mandelson. Furious at Osborne's apparent indiscretion, Rothschild went public with allegations about him and Deripaska.</p> <p>Senior Tories said conversations about donations must now be left to Feldman. 'That is a simple lesson to learn,' said one shadow minister. The vetting process currently applied to people seeking meetings with David Cameron, designed to prevent him associating with anyone potentially scandalous or embarrassing, will be extended to other senior figures.</p> <p>The party is still braced for the findings of an inquiry into shadow cabinet minister Caroline Spelman's use of Commons expenses to pay her nanny. A report from the parliamentary standards commissioner is not expected until later this autumn.</p>",
  "<p>On a chilly October night in 1964, the shipping forecast warned of fog on the Thames. Just after midnight, an East German freighter, the MV Magdeburg, slipped out of her Dagenham dock and headed slowly down river. On deck were 42 Leyland buses bound for Cuba. </p> <p>Coming the other way was the Yamashiro Maru, a Japanese ship, sailing empty. The ships met at 1.52am. The Magdeburg was making the tight turn around Broadness Point when the Yamashiro Maru ploughed into her starboard side at more than 10 knots, holing her below the waterline and pushing her across the river.</p> <p>'It was an accident, an act of God,' insisted Keith Toms, a tug crewman on the Thames that night. And that was the conclusion. No one was killed, there was no inquiry, no one was accountable and only Leyland Motors, forced to replace the buses, suffered.</p> <p>Now a historian has found documents that add weight to the suspicions of academics that the ship was rammed at the behest of the CIA - as part of an effort to sabotage anyone breaking the US embargo on Fidel Castro's Cuba.</p> <p>With the Americans threatening to blacklist any shipowner breaking the 'transportation blockade', Leyland Motors decided to use an East German ship. It was in the maritime archives of the former German Democratic Republic that John McGarry found evidence given by Gordon Greenfield, the British pilot of the Magdeburg, stating that the Japanese ship broke international law by navigating the wrong way and giving misleading signals. The captain and pilot of the Yamashiro Maru refused to speak. </p> <p>McGarry believes a crime was committed. 'I felt that the question of CIA involvement might be resolved by an examination of the pilots' logs which were supposed to be stored at Trinity House and in the Port of London Archives. They cannot be found. The East German papers show Greenfield was deceived by someone on the Yamashiro Maru who sounded a single siren blast before the collision, an intention to pass port to port,' he said.</p> <p>Greenfield said in his statement: 'The Yamashiro Maru appeared to sail towards the south of the middle channel, but I interpreted her exchange of signals to mean that she was about to turn to starboard in order to pass me on her port side. At this time there seemed to be no danger of a collision.'</p> <p>Tracked down 44 years later, Greenfield said: 'Given the atmosphere of the day, I suppose it's not surprising people read something into what happened but there's no truth in it, there was no blame attached.' He did agree that, despite reports of thick fog, visibility was so good that the two ships could see each other clearly well before Broadness Point. </p> <p>In 1975, Washington Post reporters Jack Anderson and Les Whitten cited sources who claimed that a British intelligence wiretap on Cuban offices in London gave the CIA the Magdeburg's movements, despite two Prime Ministers, Alec Douglas-Home and Harold Wilson, backing the export deal engineered by Leyland's famed salesman Donald [later Lord] Stokes.</p> <p>Anderson, a Pulitzer prize-winning journalist, is dead, but Whitten, 80, told The Observer that they had two sources. 'Jack's contacts were in the CIA and my contacts were in the National Security Agency. I don't remember a lot but I do know our sources were pretty good, the best really.' </p> <p>Harold Elletson, director of the New Security Foundation in Berlin, said: 'It would be naive to think that the CIA wouldn't dare sink an East German ship in the vital estuary of a Nato ally. They were under pressure to get results and they had a huge budget for sabotage. In 1962 the British freighter Newlane was machine-gunned loading Cuban sugar. The CIA poisoned 14,135 bags of Cuban sugar on the British ship Streatham Hill in 1962 in Puerto Rico.'</p> <p> Douglas-Home backed Leyland and President Lyndon Johnson refused to speak to him. In April 1964, minister Rab Butler was called to see Johnson. 'His reward was a tongue-lashing,' wrote Anthony Howard in the Spectator, 'during which the great, glowering figure behind the desk reached in his pocket to produce a wad of dollar bills which he flourished as he instructed Her Majesty's Britannic Foreign Secretary to come to him in future if his country wanted a cash handout rather than go selling buses to Cuba.'</p> <p>Anthony Glees, professor of intelligence studies at Buckingham University, said: 'That it was a deliberate sinking doesn't sound entirely implausible. I've a very low estimation of the CIA and its work throughout the Cold War - it's a history of failure. What would have been inconsistent is that they had an operation in the Thames they got away with.' </p> <p>But perhaps Magdeburg's controversial cargo was a coincidence. Keith Toms, then a 19-year-old deck hand, said: 'It was frightening, a ship like that turning over. I remember people crying out for help. Trinity House, the pilots' union body, was a very powerful body. No one would be castigated. People accepted that accidents happen. It was such a busy river, and even without fog collisions happen in daylight. I was surprised it sank, you wouldn't get enough force in a normal collision.'</p> <p>Dr Kristian Gustafson, CIA historian at Brunel University, was sceptical: 'What the cousins didn't do was spray in each other's countries. But was America irrational about Cuba? Absolutely. People did crazy things.'</p>",
  "<p>It used to be called the 'most expensive album never made' and many of reclusive Axl Rose's fans had long given up hope of it ever seeing the light of day, but the title track of Guns N'Roses' new album, Chinese Democracy, was finally released to radio last week. The album will be released on 24 November, after a wait of 17 years.</p> <p>Chinese Democracy will be Guns N'Roses' sixth studio album and their first album of original material since the simultaneous release of Use Your Illusion I and II in September 1991. When Use Your Illusion was released, Mikhail Gorbachev was still presiding over the last days of the Soviet Union, Manchester United hadn't won the league for 24 years and Barack Obama had just graduated with a Juris Doctor magna cum laude from Harvard Law School. The album may be released under the name Guns N'Roses, but frontman Rose is now the only remaining original member of the group and this is very much his project.</p> <p>William Bruce Rose Jr had a troubled childhood growing up in Lafayette, Indiana. After his real father, William Rose Sr, left when he was still a toddler, his mother Sharon married Stephen Bailey, changing young William's surname at the same time, and he grew up thinking Stephen Bailey was his biological father.</p> <p>When he discovered the truth at 17, he reverted to his father's surname of Rose, but shortened William to W. He later, after regression therapy, claimed he was sexually abused as a two-year-old by his biological father. He also said he was physically abused by his stepfather, as were his two younger half-siblings.</p> <p>The teenage Rose was regularly in trouble with the authorities and left for Los Angeles when he was 17. He played in several bands with schoolfriend Jeffrey Isbell, aka Izzy Stradlin, over the next few years until they settled on the classic Guns N'Roses line-up of Rose (vocals), Saul Hudson, aka Slash, (lead guitar), Stradlin (rhythm guitar), Duff McKagan (bass) and Steven Adler (drums). </p> <p>The band signed to Geffen in 1986 and released their debut album, Appetite for Destruction, on 21 July 1987. The success of third single 'Sweet Child O' Mine' and fourth single 'Paradise City' sent the band to the top of the charts and made them megastars. The album went on to sell more than 25 million copies worldwide and remains the 11th-biggest-selling album of all time in the US.</p> <p>Born out of the big-haired Sunset Strip scene of the mid-Eighties, the hard-drinking, hard-living bad boys went on to outsell their peers and transcend rock music. Even then, although he had a tattoo of the skeleton faces of the band, the young Rose stood slightly apart from them. 'I would say he seemed separate from everyone, bandmates included,' says Paul Elliott, a rock journalist who interviewed the band several times in their early years. 'He chose his words very carefully and was clearly thinking about what he was saying and doing, whereas everybody else was running around trying to get as loaded as possible.'</p> <p>The band's second album, G N'R Lies, was released in 1988, but all was not well. In 1990, Adler was sacked for drug abuse during recording sessions for the follow-up, Use Your Illusion, and Stradlin left the following year, tired of Rose's habit of keeping the audience waiting for two hours before shows. </p> <p>Following the success of Use Your Illusion (the two albums debuted at numbers 1 and 2 in the US), and a stop-gap covers compilation, The Spaghetti Incident?, Slash wanted to make a 'simple, kick-ass hard-rock record', but Rose was determined to experiment with new sounds. Slash was distraught after Rose rejected his new songs and then in 1994 recruited another guitarist - Paul Huge from Rose's hometown Lafayette - without telling him. 'I was suicidal,' said Slash. 'If I had a gun with me at the time I probably would have done myself in.' Slash left late in 1996, and original bassist McKagan left in 1998, meaning Rose has been the only original member for a decade now.</p> <p>After the death of his mother from cancer in 1996, Rose became increasingly reclusive. He was rarely spotted outside of his Malibu home, as rumours circulated about the rising cost of his endless nocturnal rehearsing and recording stints. British producer Youth, who has worked with everyone from U2 to Primal Scream, is one of the few people involved in Chinese Democracy who has spoken about the experience, after several stints working with Rose in 1998 and 1999. 'I went to his house and we started writing songs, strumming guitars in the kitchen. That was a major breakthrough because it got him singing again, which he hadn't done for a long time.'</p> <p>When Youth told Rose he wanted to record next time he came over, he was told: 'You're pushing me too fast', so he reluctantly pulled out - 'Sadly, because I think he's one of the last great showmen of rock, incredibly committed and passionate.'</p> <p>Rose hired two new musicians - Buckethead, a guitarist so called because he, naturally, likes to perform with a KFC bucket on his head, and drummer Bryan 'Brain' Mantia - and not for the first or last time, began to re-record the album. </p> <p>The picture that emerges is of a Rose with several thorns in his side, from childhood traumas to the vagaries of fame, splitting his time between his Malibu mansion and the studio, chasing his tail and working his way through a procession of musicians, producers and therapists in an endless search for peace of mind and musical direction. 'His world is very insular,' said Doug Goldstein, his manager at the time. 'He doesn't like very many people.'</p> <p>'So many times, I have come down [to the studio] and I had no idea that I was going to be able to,' Rose revealed to Rolling Stone magazine in 1999. 'If you are working with issues that depressed the crap out of you, how do you know you can express it?'</p> <p>The monthly tab for the recording was said to be around $250,000. When Rose emerged from his self-imposed absence to play the House of Blues in Las Vegas in 2001, he told the crowd: 'I have traversed a treacherous sea of horrors to be with you here tonight.' </p> <p>Every so often, there would be rumours of a release date, but in 2004 his record label finally lost patience. 'Having exceeded all budgeted and approved recording costs by millions of dollars,' the label announced in February 2004, 'it is Mr Rose's obligation to fund and complete the album, not Geffen's.'</p> <p>As with every year, there were rumours earlier this year that 2008 would finally see the release of Chinese Democracy. One school of thought suggested Rose would release it to coincide with the Beijing Olympics. Then, in March, US soft-drink manufacturer Dr Pepper pledged to give a free can to every American - apart from ex-guitarists Slash and Buckethead - if it was released this year. Rose was delighted, posting on the Guns N'Roses website that 'as some of Buckethead's performances are on our album, I'll share my Dr Pepper with him'. </p> <p>Many bands, having lost their way or momentum three or four albums in, desperately attempt, usually fruitlessly, to recapture the zest and spirit of their early works. How many times have we heard Noel Gallagher describe Oasis's latest effort as their best since Definitely Maybe? Rose, however, has insisted that part of the reason for Chinese Democracy's ridiculously long gestation period is that he was striving for something new. 'It's a very complex record. I'm trying to do something different,' he said in 2006. 'Some of the arrangements are kind of like Queen. Some people are going to say, \"It doesn't sound like Guns N'Roses.\"'</p> <p>The thing is, apart from the title track, the leaked tracks do sound like Guns N'Roses. Or certainly a lot more like Guns N'Roses than Queen. In 1999, the band contributed a track called 'Oh my God' to the soundtrack of Arnold Schwarzenegger film End of Days, which indicated that the album was heading in a more industrial, Nine Inch Nails direction. As does the eponymous track released this week. But others, such as 'Catcher in the Rye' and 'Madagascar', are more straightforward rockers, not too far removed from material on Use Your Illusion. Which wouldn't displease many of Rose's fans. Could it be that Rose has spent millions on the new Guns N'Roses purely to get them to sound like the cheap garage rock band they were originally?</p> <p>The musical landscape has changed beyond recognition since the last Guns studio album. But music is a cyclical beast and it could be that Rose has picked a very good time to return. The huge success of Guitar Hero - the video game that allows users to play along with classic guitar tracks such as GNR's 'Sweet Child O'Mine' - and the critical acclaim that has accompanied the return of fellow unreconstructed rockers such as AC/DC and Metallica suggest there's still a huge appetite for Rose's brand of musical destruction. </p> <p>Rose is now managed by Irving Azoff and Andy Gould, who can be forgiven a little hyperbole, having finally got Rose the autocrat to relinquish his hold on Chinese Democracy. 'When they asked Michelangelo to paint the Sistine Chapel, they didn't say, \"Can you do it in the fourth quarter?\"' said Gould. 'Great art sometimes takes time.'</p> <h2>The Rose lowdown</h2> <p><strong>Born:</strong> William Bruce Rose Jr on 6 February 1962 in Lafayette, Indiana. In 1990, he married Erin Everly, daughter of Don Everly and the inspiration for the band's 'Sweet Child O'Mine' single, but the couple split within a month. </p> <p><strong>Best of times: </strong> Guns N'Roses have sold more than 90 million albums worldwide.</p> <p><strong>Worst of times:</strong> Rose claims that he was sexually abused by his biological father as a toddler and later, with his half-brother and half-sister, physically abused by his stepfather. </p> <p><strong>What he says:</strong> 'I'm late to everything. I've always wanted to have it written in my will that when I die, the coffin shows up a half-hour late and says on the side, like in gold, \"Sorry I'm late\".'</p> <p><strong>What others say:</strong> 'I feel sorry for him sometimes, if only because he's such a tough act to be - he's in such a funny place because no one will really understand him as much as he would probably like to be understood.'

  "<p>Until quite recently Dominic West was a stranger to the general public. Since leaving drama school in 1996 he has appeared in several notable plays, worked on a couple of Shakespeare films and made himself something of a go-to-guy when it came to casting the obnoxious British boyfriend in American romantic comedies. But in spite of some excellent reviews, he was essentially the kind of actor who would leave audiences as he found them, none the wiser as to who he was.</p> <p>Seven years ago, West left England and went to work in the American backwater of Baltimore on a TV cop series being put together by the writer David Simon with no recognisable stars or famous names. In Britain it was screened on the obscure satellite outpost of the FX channel and registered viewing figures of around 30,000. Nor was it a great deal more popular in America. Among the tiny audience, however, was a small army of adoring critics, several of whom went so far as to proclaim the series the best TV drama in history. Word of mouth spread, a DVD audience grew, and it became a cult phenomenon on both sides of the Atlantic. The show was called The Wire and it has made West if not quite a name, then known.</p> <p>The Wire told the story of a group of detectives locked in a doomed battle with inner-city drug warlords. The narrative was multilayered, featuring scores of characters, and it eschewed easy resolutions. But nothing in the plot could rival the amazing knowledge that Detective McNulty, the hard-drinking, bed-hopping, working-class Irish-American and star of the ensemble, was in fact played by an Englishman, and not just any Englishman, but that most curious and mythologised of creatures: an Old Etonian. West inhabited the part of Jimmy McNulty so fully and convincingly that it seemed as if he'd been rehearsing for it his whole life. In fact, he sent in a self-made audition tape - 'a Robert De Niro impression, really' - on spec at the last minute. Within a few days he was flown to America, where he spent a couple of weeks trailing Baltimore cops. Then he shot the pilot. </p> <p>As the de facto lead, West effectively had to carry the first season. If he hadn't seemed authentic, the whole show would have failed. And though he says he never really understood the Baltimore accent, which is a hybrid of north and south, he had natives commend him on his accuracy.</p> <p>'Originally they wanted Ray Winstone,' says West. 'But I think he turned them down because he didn't want to live in Baltimore for five years. Maybe they were desperate or maybe I did a great tape. I don't know.'</p> <p>Now back in London, West lives with Catherine FitzGerald and their two-year-old daughter and baby boy in Shepherd's Bush. FitzGerald is the former Countess Durham, and daughter of Desmond FitzGerald, the Knight of Glin. West had a previous relationship with Polly Astor, granddaughter of Lord Astor, with whom he has a nine-year-old daughter.</p> <p>All the aristocratic connections might suggest the Old Etonian really is a member of some gilded elite. And as previous interviewers have tended to make much of his upper-class tones, I was prepared to meet a man who sounded like a mixture of Donald Sinden and Henry Blofeld. But, in fact, his voice is not really posh at all. It's his language, not his accent, that's fruity. He swears with the same boundless ease that McNulty - catchphrase: 'What the fuck did I do wrong?' - brought to the business of casual profanity. </p> <p>There's nothing grand about his house - a spacious but unexceptional London terrace - or the man. Is he, then, more Roundhead than Cavalier? </p> <p>'Do you mean am I circumcised?' he quips.</p> <p>The question is pertinent because he is soon to appear as Oliver Cromwell in the Channel 4 four-part drama The Devil's Whore, with co-stars John Simm as a fellow Roundhead and Peter Capaldi as Charles I. Created by playwright Peter Flannery, who wrote the Bafta-winning Our Friends in the North, and directed by Marc Munden, whose Iraq war drama The Mark of Cain made headlines last year, The Devil's Whore is a Civil War tale of love and death. </p> <p>'I suppose I'd have gone for the dissolute Cavaliers over the miserable Roundheads, but now I know a bit more about it, that New Model Army was astonishing.'</p> <p>Cromwell, of course, is the great hate figure of Irish history, and therefore presumably not the easiest of people to portray for someone, like West, who comes from an Irish Catholic background. 'Yeah,' he says, 'my mum still won't speak to me. And my missus, she's not Catholic, but she is Irish. We're getting married in Ireland just after it comes out, which means she'll be going through town with Oliver Cromwell. That'll go down a treat.'</p> <p>There were two things, he says, that first interested him in Cromwell. That he did nothing before he was 40 - 'and I thought that was encouraging' - (West turned 39 two weeks ago) and he cancelled Christmas, 'which is not a bad idea'. He says he set out to make Cromwell 'an evil bastard', but by the end of his research he had revised his opinion. 'I became crazy about him. I mean he was a complete fucking bastard in Ireland, but in every other way he was really rather extra-ordinary. And Ireland can be explained as a sort of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. He hit Drogheda and Wexford so hard he made the rest of Ireland surrender straight away.'</p> <p>Engagingly down to earth, West likes to laugh, a great big guffaw of amusement, and most often at his own expense. Noting that McNulty was no friend of sobriety, and that West's rom-com boyfriends have also tended to have a taste for the booze, I asked why he'd been cast so often as a drunk. </p> <p>'I think because I am one. Eventually when you've been cast for the 10th time as a drunk arsehole, you have to start thinking [he adopts a neurotic American accent] maybe I should take a look at myself. It's the same with interviews - maybe this will be a rare exception - you read them and think, \"God, they've made me sound like such an arsehole.\" Then you think, \"Mmm... every time?\"' </p> <p>In reality, West is something of a wine connoisseur, though he argues that the description is simply a synonym for 'a drunk'. He tells an anecdote about writing to the wine critic Robert Parker, 'the world's greatest nose', who is a Baltimore inhabitant, with the intention of interviewing him for a British wine magazine. </p> <p>'He said: \"You can do that if you want but, if you can get a few members of the cast together, I'd much rather take you out to this restaurant in Baltimore, and I always bring my own wine.\" So we went out with Bubbles [the actor Andre Royo], who drank Jack and coke all night, with these most sensational wines, all in magnums, David Simon [creator of The Wire], Sonja [Sohn, who played Kima] came, and I think Wendell [Pierce who was McNulty's partner 'Bunk']. We had this astonishing dinner. I can't remember anything about it, I was so plastered. All I do remember is that at the end there were still these half-full magnums of this incredible wine. So we said, \"See you Bob,\" and walked him outside; \"Thanks a lot Bob,\" and then as he went round the corner, we went, \"Quick, let's get that wine!\"'</p> <p>Unusually for an actor, he is taller than he appears on screen, but his wide, mischievous grin and sardonic humour conform to McNulty's dimensions. The baby had been the cause of a prolonged bout of sleep deprivation and West was not about to wax lyrical about the joys of a newborn. 'Boys just burp and fart and make this noise in your ear all night,' he complained. 'It's like sleeping with Rab C Nesbitt.' </p> <p>I asked him why he thought no terrestrial channel had picked up The Wire in Britain. 'I don't know,' he mused. </p> <p>'I always blamed it on there being far too many black people. We should have had more white people and we would have been a glorious success and won loads of Emmys.'</p> <p>The point, that shouldn't require explaining, is that he thinks no such thing. On the contrary, he had felt self-conscious when he joined up with the show, not so much because he was an Englishman playing a guy from Baltimore but because he was a white man playing what was effectively the lead in a largely black show.</p> <p>'It was always accepted that you had to have a white lead,' he says, 'otherwise no one would watch it. I felt a bit uncomfortable about that, or more uncomfortable than I did being a Brit stealing an American job. But it was always a great atmosphere among the actors. Among the principals, we all had the same trailer. We all got treated like shit. We were all subordinate to the writing.'</p> <p>He speaks about his years on The Wire with obvious affection, like someone recalling a beautiful land to which they know they'll never return. There has been some talk about making a feature film but David Simon has said that if it were ever made, it would have to be a prequel. 'That's OK for the black characters,' says West, 'but I'd have to have a face lift.'</p> <p>At the same time, he's relieved that the marathon is over. He had to spend half of each year in Baltimore and though he liked the city, it left him a long way from his daughter with the London-based Astor. At the end of every season he'd tell Simon he didn't think he could do another. 'David would have to try to persuade me, you know, offer me loads more sex scenes. Half those sex scenes were to try and keep me quiet.'</p> <p>Perhaps the most memorable of those scenes was the one in which an undercover McNulty adopted the guise of an English punter in a brothel. What made it particularly enjoyable for British viewers was that McNulty's English accent made Dick Van Dyke sound like David Dimbleby.</p> <p>Like The Sopranos, the series to which it was most often compared, The Wire featured a number of in-jokes. One of the minor characters, a detective named Ed Norris, was played by the real-life Baltimore police commissioner, also called Ed Norris. Many of his lines were complaints about the uselessness of the top brass. Norris was later sent to jail on charges of corruption, but returned to the show on his release. His successor also made a number of appearances. </p> <p>Despite The Wire's portrayal of police inadequacies, the Baltimore police loved the show and were very supportive of the production and cast. 'I always thought actors were - and I think they are a bit in this country - slightly frivolous people in a slightly frivolous job,' says West. 'And you always think that when you come across real people doing real jobs, like the police, they'll be slightly contentious. But they never are, particularly in America. They can't get enough of it,' he exclaims. 'Utter media whores, all of them.'</p> <p>Even in Britain the police have expressed their admiration to West. On one occasion, he was stopped in Queen's Park tube by a policeman. 'Straight away I checked myself for drugs,' jokes West, as he mimes patting his pockets. It turned out the officer worked, like McNulty, on the surveillance of drug dens. 'He said, \"We don't have the resources, though, we just wish we had your resources.\" The whole show is about how they haven't got any fucking resources!'</p> <p>West grew up in a wealthy Catholic family in a village on the outskirts of Sheffield. His father, who owned a plastics factory, decided to send his youngest son to Eton. He was terrified, he says, of returning to Sheffield during the holidays and being asked where he went to school. 'It used to be excruciating.'</p> <p>At Eton, he fell under the influence of Robert Freedman, the head of the drama department, and an English master named Raef Pane, who cast him as Hamlet.</p> <p>'He was [Ring of Bright Water author and naturalist] Gavin Maxwell's lover, I think, or certainly a good friend,' recalls West. 'He was a civilised, passionate teacher of English literature and so obsessed with boys, but not in a sexual way. He just loved boys and loved teaching. And that's what makes it an extraordinary school really, that you have these guys that are so passionate. I remember him saying, \"Of course, you've got to do this as a profession.\" It had never occurred to me that it could be a job or something I could get paid for.'</p> <p>After Eton, he went to Trinity College in Dublin, where he studied English. Dublin was a liberation, he says, because it was so far removed from Eton. 'The Irish were fascinated by the idea [of the public school]. \"What goes on there? Do yous fock each other?\" They rather liked it. And the girls loved it.' </p> <p>He appeared in a short film, while at university, and got paid for the first time. Almost without thinking, he knew that this was the life he wanted to lead. He also met Catherine FitzGerald at Trinity. As he told an American interviewer last year: '[She's] my girlfriend from university days. She dumped me back then and she married someone else, and now we're on the rebound and we're back together.'</p> <p>From Trinity he went to the Guildhall to study drama, and he hasn't been out of work since graduating. 'I remember being mystified whenever people said, \"What are you going to do?\" and I said, \"Be an actor,\" and they'd say [deep theatrical voice], \"Oh, it's very hard.\" Seems like a piece of piss to me,' he laughs. 'Hard's going to the fucking office. But no, I've been fairly lucky. Unfortunately it's been a tale of intense luck and privilege. But there you go.'</p> <p>He joined the Peter Hall Company and within a few years he landed his first Hollywood rom-com, alongside Sandra Bullock in 28 Days. One successful actor who met West during this early period of his career recalls there being quite a buzz about him in the profession. At the time, the actor put it down to the time-honoured advantages of class, but he now pays testament to West's 'extraordinary' performance in The Wire, adding that 'he was also terrific in As You Like It [the 2005 Young Vic production, alongside Sienna Miller].'</p> <p>Yet at the turn of the millennium, with stardom apparently within his grasp, West made an odd decision. He joined the circus. Not just any circus, it's true, but the acrobatic, avant-garde Argentinean circus De La Guarda. Still, it was a circus, and though Cary Grant and Burt Lancaster paid their dues under a big top, that was before they started acting. Elsewhere, West has spoken of his attraction to the physical discipline - he had to perform dance routines while suspended in the air by wire - but with me he spoke wistfully of the 'beautiful Argentinean dancers'.</p> <p>Whatever motivated the decision, it showed a willingness to stray from the predictable course; a self-confidence or indifference to convention that also registers in his best work. By contrast, he can look as if he's going through the motions in films like the 2003 Julia Roberts vehicle Mona Lisa Smile, almost laughing at their generic limitations.</p> <p>I assumed that he would have been bombarded with offers after The Wire, but he says that the best offers have come from American TV and he's not prepared to commit himself again for a long period. 'So I'm quite happy to play [disfigured villain] Jigsaw in Punisher for four really fun weeks in Montreal, rather than a really great part for six years in Baltimore.'</p> <p>Often in Britain, he says, he's called in for parts only to find that the writers really just want to talk about The Wire.</p> <p>In any case, though he enjoyed playing Cromwell, he says he doesn't much like acting in TV. 'Telly is a director's or writer's medium, but acting in telly is really boring because it's so repetitive and goes on for so long.' What he'd prefer to do is direct. He went behind the camera for episode seven of the final season of The Wire and relished the experience. He directed a scene which called for stunt cars, stunt police, stunt motorcyclists and a stunt helicopter. 'I thought I was Michael Bay [the blockbuster action director] for a bit. Oh it was fantastic. I'm desperate, desperate to do more.'</p> <p>He's trying to get into directing American TV shows like Heroes, and is hopeful David Simon may give him a slot on his new series set in New Orleans. We talk about how far American TV drama at its best has moved in front of Britain's. 'I don't know what the fuck it is,' he says, 'so I hesitate to say. But I've met some TV producers here and a director or two and you can't fucking believe some of these people have a job. You really can't. Part of what The Wire is about is how shit floats to the top. Bloody hell, it's true.'</p> <p>All of this is said less in anger than a kind of good-natured, amused rant. It's like a parody of McNulty, or perhaps the benign prototype that lent the character such appealing passion. Anyway, he tells me, there was 'fuck all' work going on. A few days later, I called him to check on some biographical details. 'I can't speak now,' he said, 'I'm dressed in a tight Regency outfit and I can't move.' Well, I thought, if that's his thing, who am I to judge? But it turned out that he was playing an evil butler in a Julian Fellowes film. </p> <p>So much for unemployment.

  "<p>She was America's sweetheart, whose rise to stardom seemed a Hollywood fairytale come true. But now the family of actress and singer Jennifer Hudson has been struck by a lethal tragedy that yesterday shocked many Americans.</p> <p>Both Hudson's mother, Darnell Hudson Donerson, and brother, Jason Hudson, have apparently been murdered, possibly in some sort of domestic dispute. </p> <p>Her seven-year-old nephew, Julian King, is also missing and yesterday he was the subject of a huge police manhunt across the state of Illinois.</p> <p>The victims were discovered shot dead inside Hudson's mother's home on the South Side of Chicago. There was no sign of a forced entry. Police later arrested William Balfour, who was married to the actress's sister and who was also thought to live at the property. No charges have yet been filed.</p> <p>The deaths have plunged Hudson from the giddy heights of her soaring career into the depths of an all-too-common American shooting tragedy. Hudson was born to working class parents and raised in the city. Her father was a bus driver. She first came to national attention on the hit talent show American Idol. Though the show can often be a career graveyard for many of its reality TV contestants, Hudson broke the mould. Despite only finishing in seventh place out of twelve in the finals, she won a role in the Hollywood film Dreamgirls. Playing Effie White, the part set her on the path to success and Hudson was a huge hit. </p> <p>She won dozens of awards for the character, which culminated in an Oscar in 2007 for Best Supporting Actress. She then went on to star in the Sex and the City movie and the current film release The Secret Life of Bees</p> <p>But despite her newfound fame, and her success in attracting further Hollywood film roles, Hudson stayed true to her roots. </p> <p>Her close family did not leave the South Side of the city, despite its reputation for crime and urban poverty. 'That says a lot about the kind of family that Jennifer comes from. They're a family of faith. They want to be attached to their roots,' the neighbourhood pastor Reverend Willie Davis told a local television station.</p> <p>But despite being prominent members of their close-knit community, they appear to have fallen victim to the violence that can form a daily part of life in America's inner cities. </p> <p>Few details of the killings have emerged and the young King has not yet been found but police in Chicago have indicated that they believe the murders were the result of a domestic dispute. </p> <p>Neighbours reported hearing gunshots from the house on Friday morning but it was not until 3pm that a relative searched the premises and discovered the body of Hudson's mother in the living room. The relative then called the police, who searched the rest of the house and found the second victim upstairs.</p> <p>Hudson's large family were said to be in deep mourning. The actress was travelling from Florida back to Chicago to be with the rest of her family. She was said to be very close to her mother and often cited her in interviews as a source of inspiration. </p> <p>A brief statement issued by Hudson's publicist said: 'The family has asked that their privacy be respected at this time.' </p> <p>However, some members of the family did talk to the media in Chicago. John Buckner, a cousin of Hudson's mother, paid tribute to her. 'She was a wonderful person. A very sweet person. She'd open up her door to anyone, just about. That could have been a problem,' he told the Chicago Sun-Times.</p>",
  "<p><strong>I'm German. My background is as a priest. </strong>In Germany, talk about sex is much freer. In the UK, they either never talk about it or talk about it non-stop. </p> <p><strong>People here are ashamed that they don't have the sex life they think they should have. </strong>They think they should be having sex morning, noon and night. </p> <p><strong>In Germany, sex is more about love and joy. </strong>Here, it's all about pain and addiction. I'm a survivor of sexual abuse. Those people often turn to the church or have sex as often as they can. I've been celibate and just short of being a trollop; quite unleashed. So, in the past, I knew both quite well. </p> <p><strong>Because of my church background I know Latin, Greek and Hebrew. </strong>But I also speak German, English, Spanish, Polish, some Arabic, some French and some Italian. I was at theological college so can say 'let us pray' or 'fuck off' in many languages. </p> <p><strong>Ninety per cent of what I deal with is psychological </strong>- erectile dysfunctions, loss of desire, premature ejaculation or vaginismus. The main reasons are low self-esteem, stress or trauma. </p> <p><strong>The biggest sexual organ</strong> is between the ears. </p> <p><strong>I saw a guy and he was incredible at pleasing women sexually. </strong>The perfect man, you might think. But much of sex is being selfish, no? And he wasn't selfish enough. As a result, he couldn't perform. </p> <p><strong>How did I help him?</strong> Well, in his case I told him to buy some sexually explicit material (I don't usually recommend people do that) and gave him permission to masturbate. He didn't ever do it as he thought it was selfish. Then I told him to buy a cock ring and explained how he should use it. With a cock ring, the erection doesn't go down and he'd never seen himself so big. He's happily married now. </p> <p><strong>The majority of women in the UK have experienced some sexual abuse. </strong>There are more than 3,000 calls to ChildLine every week and a third of those calls are reporting sexual abuse or rape. There are 39,000 kids on the child protection register in the UK and more boys than girls for the first time ever, according to figures I have seen. I'd say you have a problem in this country. Sex abuse is not about sex. There's no pleasure or love. </p> <p><strong>The British attitude to sex? </strong>There are still remnants of Victorian conservative values and a respect for privacy. But then there is a high level of child abuse and the highest teenage pregnancy rate in Europe. So I think you have problems. People say it's because you are an island with an island mentality. But that's bollocks.

  "<p>A month after my 29th birthday I decided to stop having sex. I'd had plenty of sexual partners (30 or so), a sprinkling of one-night stands, a fair balance between 'making love' and 'just' sex. I had no hang-ups about it - indeed, it was getting better as I got older. I'd had serious boyfriends, and I'd had many more less serious ones whom I'd dated for a few weeks or months. I'd had my requisite lesbian experiments - it's practically a 21st-century requirement.</p> <p>But on the cusp of my thirties I suddenly realised I didn't want to keep racking up the numbers, continuing on the same path I was on. I was over sexual liberation, a feminist doctrine that had gained us the right to enjoy our sexuality, and by extension promiscuity, without repudiation. I felt like dating had become a burlesque comedy where we all pretended we were emotionless and cool - when in actual fact dating was a fruitless, haunting quest for a snatch of intimacy, a warm body, a less-lonely night. Sex had become an obligation, not a choice. I wanted sex to be, quite simply, special again.</p> <p>I made the decision to stop having sex for exactly one year back in April. I work for Senator Obama's campaign for president and my announcement to colleagues in the office - a bunch of twentysomething Ivy League Grads - was met with gentle derision, teasing about 'promise rings' and snide comments about conservative attitudes towards sex, promoting abstinence over informed education. I was either on the path to becoming part of the Christian Right, they joked, or I was plain masochistic. Even my friends regarded me with curiosity, and a little awe. 'Do you enjoy sex?' they probed.</p> <p>Yes, definitely. In fact, I had to admit I'd had the best sex of my life with my most recent 'boyfriend' of six weeks, James, who had subsequently 'left' me for a hot Hispanic girl. 'So if you enjoy it, why would you want to stop?' Because I'd started to realise I was utterly incapable of separating sex and emotion and was sick of pretending otherwise. I was sick of having sex before I knew someone properly, sick of physical intimacy preceding emotional. </p> <p>I'm not religious at all and have always believed that both men and women should have sexual experiences with several partners before they commit to one person for the rest of their lives. I even harbour a sneaking suspicion that monogamy is not possible, and that as long as no one finds out or gets hurt, maybe extramarital affairs can actually keep a long-term relationship alive. </p> <p>Shortly before my 'nearing-thirty' sex revelation, I bumped into an old friend, Diane. I remembered her from university as tall, blonde, glamorous, and with plenty of dates and admirers. We went for a drink and she told me she was celebrating her fifth wedding anniversary that week. Over the course of the evening I discovered the only person Diane had ever slept with was her husband. She'd met him, aged 25, two weeks before a devastating car-crash in which she nearly died. He visited her every day in hospital, and they fell in love over IV drips and plaster-casts. They had their first kiss six months after the crash in hospital, and were married a year after they met. </p> <p>I have to say my initial thought was: what a freak! What kind of person would commit to one guy for the rest of her life without having sampled a few others, just to check she was getting a good deal? Loser! Prepare the divorce papers! I'm a cynic, yeah, I'll admit. And then revelation number two hit. </p> <p>After Best-Sex-Of-My-Life guy - James - ditched me for the hot Hispanic, I'd been initially pretty upset, but as we lived in the same area, we bumped into each other on a regular basis and gradually became good friends. We would often end up drinking beer and chatting after work, and it occurred to me that this ease and friendship had been markedly lacking when we were sleeping together, possibly because we had sex before we even knew each other's last name.</p> <p>On one trip to the pub, James let slip that his new girlfriend, Luna, was a strict Catholic and refused to have sex before marriage. I was devastated! I'd put so much work into trying to impress him sexually, make myself alluring and attractive, and after he'd rejected me, I'd taken perverse comfort in convincing myself that Luna was some kind of sexual deviant I could not possibly compete with, when, in fact, she was the complete opposite. </p> <p>I started thinking more about sex and relationships, identifying unhealthy patterns in my past. I always fell for guys incredibly quickly, and sex came before full acquaintance in every one of my failed dating experiences, although the men I'd dated for a year or two had always started out as friends before we made the relationship physical. I talked about it with an older friend of mine, and his advice was simple. 'Don't put out. Then you know they like you for the right reasons.' As a good Democrat, I felt slightly weird seeking conservative advice from a man who voted for George Bush and thinks Sarah Palin is sex-on-a-stick, but I had to admit he had a point.</p> <p>In the past, I had relied too much on playing the vamp, on trying to 'hook' a boyfriend with my purported sexual prowess. I felt, almost unconsciously, that to be 'worth' something in the cattle-market of dating, I also had to hold a packed resume of sexual skills - acts so intimate that they are absurdly remote from any form of intimacy, particularly when performed like the quicktime with a relative stranger on date three.</p> <p>I felt like I was stuck in what Ariel Levy calls 'a spring-break variety of thongs-and-implants exhibitionism'. In her book Female Chauvinist Pigs, Levy questions whether the recent hyper-sexualised, commercialised porn star ideal of sex and exhibitionism many young women have adopted really amounts to empowerment. If I looked back at my last four sexual partners, all of whom I'd slept with while convincing myself I didn't want any emotional complication, I realised I'd been unable to separate sex and intimacy. I had, in effect, slept with most of them way before I felt comfortable with the fact, merely because I'd had the resigned attitude that 'I've done it so many times before, why not?'</p> <p>Sex wasn't significant and special for me any more, because if it was significant, if sex was as intimate and as special as I thought it was back when I was a virginal teen convinced no one would ever find me attractive enough to kiss, I'd be ripped to the core after over-exposure to 21st-century dating culture. Paris Hilton once said: 'My boyfriends always tell me I'm not sexual. Sexy, but not sexual.' There's a lot of sex out in the world right now, but bleached of intimacy through its very over-familiarity and lack of personalisation, like Paris, it's not very sexual.</p> <p>I'm now on month seven without sex, and in that time I haven't been on a single date. Of course, the fact I'm working 16 hours a day on the election campaign has helped curb my extra-curricular activities immensely - I feel that the only guy in my life right now is Senator Obama! But I've also found that making a solid resolve not to date has changed my attitude towards the men I meet in everyday life. No longer do I instantly assess them as potential dates or partners, I see them first as possible friends. I've developed a very close, impossibly chaste friendship with my neighbour, Dave, a 34-year-old musician.</p> <p>While I have to admit that I find him attractive, I also can't help acknowledging the fact that he probably isn't the guy I want to spend the rest of my life with. Why would I ruin a friendship by having sex with him then? Ironically, he too feels disillusioned with relationships and dating, and we often end up curled around each other on his bed, wrapped in a duvet, watching the election debates and falling asleep in a companionable hug that feels more intimate and genuine to me than any sex I've had in the past few years.</p> <p>James broke up with Luna after a few months, but he's stayed in my life, and when I'm on the road with the election campaign he's always at the end of a phone line, ready to dole out advice and listen to my stories of life campaigning in red states. He's become one of my closest friends, and even though I felt tempted to sleep with him again after he'd broken up with Luna, I resisted the urge and I'm glad I did. For some reason, sex made us strangers, and not sleeping together made us friends. I feel extremely lucky to have men like him and Dave in my life - they're my surrogate boyfriends. They support me, listen to my problems, I listen to theirs, we hang out together and enjoy each other's company - we just don't kiss, or anything else. </p> <p>I still think sex is an integral part of a healthy relationship, but holding back from sex until you've forged a strong, solid friendship ensures that sex doesn't dominate a relationship, that it becomes another component holding equal weight with trust, friendship, honesty, mutual support.</p> <p>I was registering new voters in a bar with a colleague of mine, Lakshmi, the other day, and she tentatively brought up the sex issue. She'd heard I'd decided to give it up for 12 months, and wanted to know how that was going. I found out she'd recently had an abortion under pressure from her ex-boyfriend, was understandably disillusioned with men and wanted to take a complete break. Like me, she was someone who fell headlong into passionate, lust-filled sexual relationships that fizzled out quickly leaving only a few singe marks. </p> <p>I would never say I regret my past and the number of people I've slept with, but I'm certainly glad I've made a conscious decision to change my lifestyle. I think of it as a natural progression, a part of growing and changing. Dating and mating wasn't working, and while it was fun for a while, I wanted something more. There seems to be a pervading, unarticulated suspicion that it's somehow weak and un-feminist to admit to yourself that you can't have sex without emotion, that you don't want to be promiscuous, that you would like a serious relationship that will lead somewhere other than the bedroom. I have to say, here and now, I can't sleep with someone without developing feelings for them, I don't want to be promiscuous, and I would like a serious relationship with someone.</p> <p>These days I feel like I've rediscovered an intimacy that was somehow absent in my sexual life - I guess we live in an age that almost celebrates the death of intimacy. For me, it was only by stopping and taking time out, concentrating on my work and friendships, that I could actually step back and see that my sexual liberation was perversely trapping me in destructive relationships, while intimacy had become something elusive, insubstantial, disappointing, surreal - a utopia of sorts.</p> <p>As the possible next president of the United States says, 'Change will not come if we wait for some other person or some other time. We are the ones we've been waiting for. We are the change that we seek.' I had to take the initiative and change my behaviour and attitude. I think Senator Obama would be pretty amused.</p> <p>\u2022 Anonymous is a 29-year-old Briton living in America</p>",
  "<p>As the sun goes down on a golden age for retail, Westfield London, the capital's gleaming new mega-mall at Shepherd's Bush, will send out a powerful siren call to consumers when it opens its doors on Thursday.</p> <p>The pull will be strong thanks to its comely proportions: in designer heaven 'the Village', shimmering chandeliers and rippled glass make the windows of Louis Vuitton and Prada look like they are floating. And don't say 'food court'; its marketers say the atmosphere on 'the Balcony' will be like dusk falling on the Djemaa el-Fna in Marrakesh.</p> <p>Window dressing aside, the timing is plain bad, bringing nearly two miles of new shops to London, a city at the forefront of the credit crunch. However, it would seem that shopping centres are like buses; you wait ages, then they all come at once. By Christmas, 13 - unlucky for some - will have opened, including three multi-billion-pound projects: Westfield London, Liverpool One and Bristol's Cabot Circus.</p> <p>The logjam comes just as consumers are being forced to face their personal spending demons, with one analyst describing some Britons as 'saturated with debt' after spending a decade at the shops. It has been spend, spend, spend, with retailers ringing up an extra \u00a39bn every year, but the gravy train has come to a juddering halt as consumers' real wealth is eroded by inflation and confidence rocked by the banking crisis.</p> <p>But even if the economic storm clouds threaten to put a damper on Thursday's ribbon-cutting ceremony, Westfield UK managing director Michael Gutman is of the mind that, downturn or no, Britain needs more shops.</p> <p>'The forecasts might be pointing to a period of slower growth but we are looking to establish a business here over the long term,' he says, pointing out that retail space per capita in the UK is a third of America and half that of the shopping centre developer's native Australia.</p> <p>Indeed, even before London Mayor Boris Johnson reaches for the scissors, the centre could already be considered a roaring success. The complex is 99 per cent let, with a starry line-up of luxury brands such as Tiffany and A-list debutantes from around the world, such as Abercrombie &amp; Fitch spin-off Hollister.</p> <p>But some analysts say, at least in the short term, that the glut of new space is going to intensify the correction in the sector as consumers rein in spending, putting pressure on stores in London's West End and nearby Brent Cross. They point out that the retail sector has absorbed 88 million sq ft of new space - equivalent to around 1,200 football pitches - over the past 20 years, presenting store bosses with too many mouths to feed just as the pickings get thinner. But that gloomy prognosis is at odds with the demand from retailers - and shoppers - for the new centres. When it opened in September, Cabot Circus attracted 120,000 shoppers in just three hours, while 140,000 turned out when the second phase of the \u00a31bn Liverpool One centre opened earlier this month.</p> <p>'We appear to be bucking the trend with a very strong performance to date,' says Liverpool One chief executive Joanne Jennings. She says shopping activity in the city centre is up 30 per cent as a result of the city's status as Capital of Culture. 'While we can't ignore the current economic climate, footfall has been strong to date,' she adds. 'We have invested heavily in the retail offer and marketing because we are conscious of the need to get numbers up as people become more cautious.'</p> <p>But Verdict analyst Neil Saunders predicts a retail crunch is coming: 'People have bought a lot more stuff than ever before and are saturated with debt. When you ask \"Do I need it?\", it will be easier easy to say no, because we have all got so much stuff already.' </p> <p>The UK retail sector has regularly chalked up annual growth of around 4 per cent, but Verdict estimates that this will slow to 2.4 per cent in 2008, with the lion's share gobbled by the supermarkets. Verdict predicts the going will get even tougher next year, with non-food sales set to contract 0.2 per cent. </p> <p>In the new era ushered in by the credit crunch, it has become harder for consumers to borrow to spend, as 0 per cent credit card deals disappear and a deflating housing market stifles equity release. Also, during the boom years Britons plundered their savings, leaving them without the cushion to ease the pain of the coming months as incomes fall in real terms. Therein lies the rub for retailers: the pie has to shrink, leaving retailers, particularly in clothing, to slug it out for every slice. </p> <p>Rob Templeman, Debenhams chief executive, concedes that a fierce market share battle is looming, but says new stores deliver good returns for the chain (it is an anchor of both Westfield London and Liverpool One). 'If numbers are going backwards, it has got to be about market share,' he says. 'But we have very light coverage in this part of London and there are a lot of chimney pots.' </p> <p>Of the \u00a3228bn spent at the shops this year, an estimated \u00a3128bn is classed as indulgence and therefore vulnerable in a downturn. Price deflation has been a key part of the spending picture, enabling consumers to buy more from more retailers. But the return of inflation this year, particularly in food, has turned the tide, with sales volumes in the final quarter of this year expected to be at their lowest level since 1995. Some sectors are more exposed than others, with the homewares and DIY market expected to have shed \u00a31.8bn by 2009, almost the equivalent of Homebase's turnover. Indeed, Homebase owner Home Retail Group plunged to a first-half loss after it substantially wrote down the value of the chain.</p> <p>'Consumers have been on a spending binge,' continues Saunders. 'Over the past decade, and especially towards the back end, expenditure growth has outstripped income growth by quite some margin. You don't have to be good at maths to see that people had been living beyond their means.'</p> <p>But the property industry points to the need for 'evolution', as the utilitarian malls of the Sixties and Seventies, with their stifling interiors and harsh strip lighting, reach the end of their life. Cabot Circus, which replaced the rundown Broadmead, set a new standard with its architecturally stunning, shell-shaped roof and \u00a312.5m public art budget. Heightening the sense that shopping has become almost a religion for many Britons, the opening celebrations featured the performance of a specially written cantata, based on songs sung by construction workers of 60 nationalities.</p> <p>With Westfield London - also referred to as White City - in the bag, the developer is looking to Stratford in east London, where it plans to build an even bigger centre in 2011. 'There is a fundamental under-supply of quality retail space in London and there still will be after Westfield opens,' says Gutman. He uses the example of Sydney, where five million residents have a choice of 26 shopping centres, whereas the area bounded by the M25, with eight million inhabitants, has just five major malls.</p> <p>Some planned developments are expected to be mothballed in the months and years ahead but Gutman says that its ambitions for Stratford are undimmed, with M&amp;S, John Lewis and Waitrose already on board and committed to the largest footprints available. 'We can't control the economic cycle, but we can create the best store environments possible for the long term,' he adds.</p> <p>Analysts argue that retailers with strong, differentiated brands are best placed to survive the coming downturn. By that token, quirky fashion retailer Ted Baker has taken two stores in Westfield, developing a more upmarket proposition, 'Ted Baker Pashion', for its store in the luxury village, which it believes will attract shoppers who want designer products without testing the limits on their credit cards.</p> <p>'Luxury is resilient because people aspire to trading up and want to invest in better quality pieces,' says Ted Baker chief executive Ray Kelvin; with that in mind, Pashion will stock his firm's designer ladieswear brand, Langley, and its suit collection, Phormal. 'Perversely, we don't mind if things get tough as we can demonstrate we offer something different. It won't be new business, it will have to come from another retailer, so we will have to try harder,' he says.</p> <p>The next two years will be a defining period for retailers as, after a decade of excess, they are forced to sing for their supper. With non-food sales predicted to fall next year, some retailers will be fighting for survival. It will also become apparent whether shoppers can keep spending once the excitement of a pristine new shopping centre wears off.</p>",
  "<p>Devaluation used to be a dirty word in British politics: sterling's status as the world's reserve currency was a symbol of the country's economic might, and Chancellors who oversaw sudden downward lurches in its value on the foreign exchanges faced humiliation. Even in 1992, when pretensions to empire were long gone, the pound's plunge out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism was regarded as the worst failure of financial management for a generation.</p> <p>In the depths of this 21st-century economic crisis, Britain's status in the world economy is once again being questioned - and sterling has come under sustained attack. It plunged from $1.75 against the dollar on Monday, to little more than $1.58 by the end of the week. By mid-afternoon on Friday, it had fallen farther than even on Black Wednesday.</p> <p>Alistair Darling, unlike his hapless predecessors, can leave it to the foreign exchange markets to set the value of the pound; but the message from the world's investors last week was no less loud and clear than in 1992, or 1967: confidence in Britain's economy has been brutally shattered. Confirmation that a recession is almost certainly upon us, with a 0.5 per cent decline in GDP in the third quarter of the year, just added fresh urgency to a sell-off that was already well under way.</p> <p>The strength of the pound over the past decade, despite a vast and growing trade gap, made exports expensive, and tightened the squeeze on manufacturing that had begun in the 1980s. Confidence in the City as an economic powerhouse helped to sustain the demand for sterling, detracting from problems elsewhere in the economy.</p> <p>It was a hard-hitting speech from King on Tuesday, in which he used the word 'recession' for the first time, that unleashed the latest decline. The governor pointed out that Britain's banks - and the economy as a whole - have been heavily dependent on loans from overseas investors, and 'those external inflows have fallen sharply - a mild form of the reversal of capital inflows experienced by a number of emerging market economies in the 1990s'. In other words, Britain is facing a diluted version of the brutal punishment meted out by the markets to Thailand, Malaysia and other vulnerable countries during the Asian financial crisis in 1997 and 1998.</p> <p>Then, almost overnight, investors radically reassessed the prospects for these 'tiger' economies. For years, they had been the stars of the international markets; suddenly, as it became clear that many of the cheap loans that had poured into Asian businesses could probably never be paid back, they were written off as basket cases. Billions of dollars of 'hot money' flooded out, forcing them to devalue their currencies. The cost of servicing their foreign debts rocketed, and many were driven ignominiously into the arms of the International Monetary Fund - the same fate now facing Hungary, Pakistan and others.</p> <p>Over the past decade, the UK, like the tigers in their day, has been attracting billions of dollars of foreign investment, allowing its banks to lend far more than they were taking in deposits from savers, and households to run up unprecedented debts. King's reminder of the fate of fragile emerging economies a decade ago was a stark warning that, unless the flows of capital into Britain are now replaced with new sources of financing, the adjustment now facing the economy will be even more jarring than analysts previously thought.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the mass exodus from the pound after he spoke suggested that if anything, the outflow of capital is likely to accelerate. So irredeemably gloomy is the news from the economy, that one City analyst, Howard Archer of Global Insight, even said sorry last week for the repetitiveness of his research notes: 'I apologise for this analysis being virtually identical to other recent reaction pieces but there are only so many ways you can say that the housing market is up the creek and sadly lacking on the paddle front,' he said.</p> <p>Comparing Britain's fate with the spectacular Asian collapse may seem far-fetched, but Professor Nick Crafts of the London School of Economics says the parallel is apt, at least in one sense: the boom of the past decade concealed extraordinary failings of regulation, and weaknesses in the financial health of businesses and households. 'Falling property prices weaken balance sheets, and something that looked very good suddenly crumbles,' he says.</p> <p>For the past decade, many analysts have argued that the pound was unusually high against the dollar and euro; now, with the vulnerabilities of the banking system and the consumer sector painfully obvious, an adjustment seems to be taking place. Crafts says that, like the record of the Asian economies in the early 1990s, the record of the past 10 years in Britain will look rather different in hindsight. 'It wasn't a mirage, it was a good economic performance - but there were some warning signs. I think we'll come to see it as less secure than it seemed at the time.'</p> <p>Among the first to feel the pound's new-found feebleness will be holidaymakers. Britain's consumers have made lavish use of their strong overseas spending power for the past decade, aided by the rise of cut-price air travel and the property boom that has given them windfall profits to spend on second homes in Tuscany or Spain.</p> <p>Christmas shopping in New York, once the preserve of the super-rich, became attainable for many in the middle classes with money to burn, as the pound shot up to $2; and an annual holiday abroad moved from being a luxury to a must-have for ordinary families. According to government figures, holidaying Brits spent \u00a319.5bn overseas in 1998; by 2007, that had shot up to \u00a335bn.</p> <p>Holiday spending was already destined for a squeeze, as indebted households struggle to come to terms with the rising cost of credit - and the decline in the value of property, which for many is their main asset. But the decline in sterling will make travellers acutely conscious of Britain's fading fortunes.</p> <p>Yet notwithstanding the blow to national pride, many economists believe a cheaper pound may eventually help to lift the economy out of recession, making exports cheaper, and redressing some of the economy's imbalances.</p> <p>King's apparently relaxed view - many analysts saw his Tuesday-night intervention as nothing less than a deliberate effort to 'talk down the pound' - contrasts with the stubborn masochism of former inhabitants of Threadneedle Street and the Treasury.</p> <p>When Winston Churchill was Chancellor, in 1925, there was a furious row about whether Britain should return to the Gold Standard at the high exchange rate that had prevailed before the First World War. Received wisdom, including that of Montagu Norman, the mercurial Bank of England governor, was that Britain must confirm its international prowess by rejoining. Churchill flirted with the alternative view, espoused by John Maynard Keynes, that such a return would be disastrous, and held a celebrated dinner party, with Keynes among the guests, to debate the issue into the night over champagne and brandy.</p> <p>Eventually, the pro-Gold Standard camp won Churchill over, but the decision turned out to be a terrible miscalculation, crippling already struggling export industries, including shipbuilding, coal and textiles and contributing to the massive industrial unrest that culminated in the General Strike a year later.</p> <p>Keynes responded by dashing off a polemical pamphlet called The Economic Consequences of Mr Churchill, echoing the title of his more famous essay on the punitive reparations imposed on Germany after the First World War.</p> <p>A misguided determination to cling to the strength of sterling continued to be a motif of British economic management in the 20th century.</p> <p>Professor Catherine Schenk of Glasgow University, who specialises in the postwar period, says that during past devaluations the public often made the mistake of assuming that a weak currency was a mark of failure. 'People were worried about the impact on their cost of living,' she says. 'The embarrassment looms large in the public's imagination, but you have to remember that a strong pound hurts exporters.'</p> <p>Policymakers watching the pound declining so rapidly would usually be deeply concerned about inflation taking off, as the price of imports in sterling terms shoots up; but as the economy slows sharply, soaring unemployment is expected to keep a lid on wage rises, and retailers are unlikely to be able to pass on cost increases to hard-pressed consumers.</p> <p>Just as the return to the Gold Standard was not a mark of Britain's prowess but an unbearable economic burden, the rare strength of sterling over the past decade, as consumer debts piled up and the trade deficit ballooned, may one day be seen as a symptom of an economy running out of control. </p> <p>And the decline in the pound, galling though it is for shoppers hoping to snap up Christmas bargains in Macy's or Bloomingdale's, may eventually provide the impetus the economy needs for what King has called 'the long march back to boredom and stability'.</p> <h2>Devaluation crises</h2> <p><strong>1931: All that glisters ...</strong><br>Six devastating years after returning to the Gold Standard, which tied sterling to the value of gold reserves at the costly prewar exchange rate, Philip Snowden, Chancellor in the emergency national government, suspends convertibility. But not before much of British industry is devastated by the expensive pound, and Montagu Norman, governor of the Bank of England, has a nervous breakdown.</p> <p>Sterling almost immediately falls by 20 per cent against the dollar, helping to spark an economic recovery. Sidney Webb, Colonial Secretary in Ramsay MacDonald's Labour government, which was torn apart by the financial crisis that resulted from trying to cling to the Gold Standard, later exclaimed, 'nobody told us we could do that'.</p> <p><strong>1949: Postwar blues</strong><br>The Austerity Chancellor, Stafford Cripps, bows to the inevitable and announces a devaluation from $4.03 to $2.80, in the hope of reviving Britain's bombed-out postwar economy. The price of a loaf of bread, made with imported American wheat, rises from 4d to 6d.</p> <p><strong>1967: Wilson's woes</strong><br>After the Bank of England spends \u00a3200m in gold and foreign currency reserves trying to maintain the value of the pound in the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates, Harold Wilson announces a devaluation from $2.80 to $2.40. He fruitlessly tries to reassure voters that 'it does not mean that the pound here in Britain, in your pocket or purse or in your bank, has been devalued'.</p> <p><strong>1992: Tumbling out of the ERM</strong><br>Norman Lamont is forced to stumble on to the steps of the Treasury to say Britain is suspending its membership of the European exchange rate mechanism, after announcing two interest rate rises in a single day to try to support sterling against the Deutschmark.</p> <h2>From bad to worse: developing nations on brink of collapse</h2> <p>Britain faces the grim reality of its first serious recession in 17 years, but less developed countries are in a worse state, with several on the verge of collapse and seeking emergency funds from Western financial institutions.</p> <p>Top of the critical list is nuclear-armed Pakistan. With more than 172 million people, it is by far the biggest and most significant country outside the US and EU to seek a bail-out from the International Monetary Fund, joining Turkey, Ukraine, Hungary and Belarus. Pakistan is a key American ally and if it defaulted on its international loans, it would have serious consequences for the new pro-US government of President Asif Ali Zardari.</p> <p>Analysts fear that as economic conditions worsen, millions more will be pushed into abject poverty, which could help Islamic extremists to recruit new converts. Pakistan's border region with Afghanistan already resembles a war zone, with 120,000 troops engaged in a crackdown against militants who support the Taliban and al-Qaeda. </p> <p>The country's financial meltdown has seen Pakistan's foreign reserves dwindle by $1bn a month as the authorities have tried, unsuccessfully, to prop up the plummeting currency, as well as subsidise food in the face of roaring inflation that has hit 25 per cent. Foreign banks and lenders have withdrawn credit and overseas investors have fled.</p> <p>A continuing decline in the value of the rupee could effect the ability of Pakistan to import basic foodstuffs and goods and force the government to cut back further on spending, increasing the number of jobless. There is a huge current account deficit, further eroding confidence.</p> <p>When emerging nations run into trouble, it reduces their ability to import foreign goods from countries such as Britain, and hits a global economy hammered by the credit crunch. According to the credit default swap market in London, there is a 90 per cent chance of Pakistan defaulting on foreign loans due for repayment in the next three months to two years.</p> <p>Last week, Shaukat Tarin, the country's economic adviser, admitted that Pakistan was in talks about aid from the IMF, but was also looking for help from China, a long-time strategic ally.</p> <p>Developing countries face severe difficulties as the world credit crisis takes it toll on nations unable to launch bail-outs on anything like the scale of America and Europe. Police have been called to the Karachi stock exchange, which has been besieged by angry investors who have seen their shareholdings wiped out.</p> <p>Pakistan's banks have overextended themselves and many have withdrawn credit from heavily-indebted consumers and businesses. The government is said to need at least $4bn in the next few weeks.</p> <p>Analysts warn of dire consequences unless the international community rallies around Pakistan, whose support is seen as critical to the Nato mission in Afghanistan. Rating agencies said a Pakistani request for help from the IMF was a positive step that could put the country on a firmer footing, but much would depend on how soon the government could implement the reforms that would be a condition of any bail-out.</p> <p>Elsewhere, Hungary hiked interest rates from 8.5 to 11.5 per cent last week to protect its currency and prevent a further increase in the size of its foreign currency debts. However, analysts warn that the move will accelerate the decline in economic growth.<br><strong>Richard Wachman</strong></p>",
  "<h2>Indonesia 1969: Rully Dasaad</h2> <p><strong>After Barack's parents split up, he moved with his mother and Indonesian stepfather to Jakarta, aged seven, where he befriended classmate Dasaad - now a commercial photographer - at Basuki Primary School. </strong></p> <p>When the teacher introduced 'Barry Soetoro' [Obama went by his stepfather's name at the time] to the class, he was very exotic. He was the only non-Indonesian; he was taller than all of us and chubby. He was accompanied by his white mum and his Indonesian stepfather, who was wearing a military outfit, and I remember thinking, that's strange, he looks half black, half white - maybe this is what a boy from Hawaii looks like. He wore Bermuda pants that extended below the knee, whereas our short pants were halfway down our thigh, and he wore T-shirts with stripes whereas ours were plain. He was the only left-handed student in class - it's not considered polite in Indonesia to be left-handed - so it was always amazing to see him writing with his left hand. </p> <p>Barry was the only one in the class who had bread in his lunch box - the rest of us had traditional Indonesian snacks. There's one called kepan - sticky rice and desiccated coconut which you have to dip in this very strong chilli sauce. It's hot even for us. But Barry was very curious. He tried it and burnt his mouth, and he was saying: 'It's hot, it's hot.' You can see he was always open to learning something new.</p> <p>He and his mum had been living in Indonesia since 1967. She worked for USAID, helping Indonesian women in the countryside to live in a more Western fashion. For the first two months, Barry was still adjusting. We had a singing class once a week and he wouldn't sing, probably because he was shy and worried that he might sing a word wrong. But after three months, he spoke Indonesian. He became one of us. </p> <p>I remember one time he had a birthday and I went to his house with some classmates. Barry's house was down a mud track; to play football there, you had to put plastic bags on your feet. Near his house was a small canal - at that time it wasn't polluted - and they had small salamanders in it. Barry had chickens in his home field. It was totally normal for Jakarta in those days.</p> <p>Me, Barry and Yanto used to play together every lunch break for two years and he was very loyal to our gang. If I said: 'Don't play with that boy, play with us', he'd do it. We'd try to finish our lunch as fast as we could and then we'd go to the fields and play: running, hide and seek, marbles and tak gebok, an Indonesian game of tag where you try to hit your fellow boys with a ball. One time, there was a naughty young boy who missed Barry with the ball so he took a small stone from the playing field and threw it and hit Barry's head, which started bleeding. I remember Barry just went quiet - his mum had taught him not to fight. He was one of those kids you could tell was brought up with a lot of love and affection and so he was never angry or nasty.</p> <p>We loved playing so much we were always in on the third bell. Most of the girls had a problem with our gang because we were always very active and sweating, and sometimes we'd miss-throw and hit a girl. 'Oh, here they are again,' they'd say. 'Oh, you're sweating from the sun, you stink, go away.' So I had to teach Barry Indonesian swear words to say back to the girls.</p> <p>At the time, my father and President Sukarno were the only people in the country with Cadillacs, and both were presents from my grandpa, who was the richest man in Indonesia. Grandpa bought me all the DC Comic books, and I was the only one who had them, so Barry and Yanto would borrow the books and copy pictures of Batman and Spider-Man out and ask me to judge which was better. Barry was always better than Yanto. Even Yanto always agreed with that. Barry had a great eye. </p> <p>We came back from the summer vacation for fifth grade and Barry wasn't there. The teacher said he'd gone back to Hawaii. Our small gang was split up. </p> <p>Somebody said in 2006: 'Look at Time magazine - your old friend is running for President.' I didn't recognise him. He was much slimmer. Then I saw a picture where he was laughing and I recognised him from the smile and the teeth.</p> <p>Later on there were allegations that the school was a madrassa, and foreign journalists began hanging around. But the small mosque at the school today was added on in 2001. There was no mosque at the time and it wasn't even a particularly religious school.</p> <p>It's very sad if a great nation like America wants to persecute Obama just because he was born from a Muslim dad and had a Muslim stepfather. I'm sure one of the reasons for the flexibility he has today is his experiences in Indonesia. At the school, there were half-Chinese and half-Dutch Indonesians, Javanese people, Ambonese, and there were Buddhists, Hindus, Muslims, Christians and Catholics. Barry is used to a mix.</p> <h2>Hawaii 1975: Tony Peterson</h2> <p><strong>Barack moved back to Honolulu, Hawaii in 1971, aged 10, and lived with his grandparents. At Punahou High School, he met Peterson, who now works for the United Methodist Church in Tennessee.</strong></p> <p>There were only five black kids out of 1,600. I used to get to school early; I'd see Barry and he'd say: 'Let's go shoot some hoops' and we'd play pick-up basketball together. He was a bit chubby but far better than me. Rik, Barry and myself jockeyed around and talked casually, and realised that here we are, intelligent black men, and we could have some good conversations.</p> <p>We'd sit on the sidestep of the library, where a radio would be playing Marvin Gaye and the Eagles, and have these great conversations about life. I recorded one for an English assignment. Rik asked what we thought 'time' was, and Barry replied: 'Time is just a collection of human experiences combined so that they make a long, flowing stream of thought.'</p> <p>He was 14 then, Rik was 16, I was 17, and Barry was definitely matching us. We talked about the future. Rik said he'd be a doctor, which he is; I was going to be a lawyer, which I'm not; and Barry was going to be a basketball player. Barry wrote in my year book: 'Go on and get that law degree, and I'm going to be a famous basketball player, and when I need to sue my team I'll call you.' Of course he went on to be the lawyer and not a shabby one either.</p> <p>We talked about race but not, I thought, out of a deep sense of pain. The revolutionary anger started to die down in the Seventies. We weren't dealing with the harsh barriers, more with the rate of change, the progress we were making. Black culture was popular across the race spectrum. Jesse Jackson was a big public figure, everyone loved Stevie Wonder, the most popular sports star was Julius 'Doctor J' Ervin, the basketball genius. So we were talking about things like: would the girls date us black guys and would we see a black President in our lifetime? The answer to the first was yes and on the second our take was: there'll be progress, but we won't see it happen.</p> <p>Decades later, I was in a bookstore in Boulder, Colorado, visiting my brother Keith and he picks this book Dreams From My Father out of the remainder bin and said: 'Look who wrote this.' It was Barry's memoir. Where he talks about his Punahou years, I was surprised by the agony he was feeling. But I'd been black all my life in a way that Barry sort of hadn't. People looked at him and saw a black man, but his own identity was that he was raised by and living with his white mother and these white grandparents. And maybe because of his white half, white people were willing to let their racist side out in front of him. So he had a lot to wrestle with, especially as a teenager. He was questioning things and following them towards agony and resolution.</p> <p>In 2004 (at the Democratic convention), I told all my friends that an old friend of mine was making the speech. I've voted both sides before, but I have never heard a political speech so profound. What he was saying is what I believe - that's the America I want to live in. I'm extremely proud of him and I trust him. I know the man. I trust his intellect. I trust his judgment.</p> <p>One of my favourite lines from that speech was something we used to talk about on the library step: 'We need to eradicate the slander that says a black kid with a book is acting white.' That was the kind of stuff we'd experienced; I had lived a lifetime of trying to do well academically and having black kids say: 'You're acting white.'</p> <p>Punahou was a good school - my family had to save every penny to send me there, Obama scraped in on a scholarship. It was originally a school to educate missionaries' children and it still had that missionary spirit. One of the things that Punahou instilled in us is that you're given much in order to give much - you're here to go out and help the world.</p> <h2>Los Angeles 1980: Margot Mifflin</h2> <p><strong>University friend of Obama at Occidental College, LA. Now a journalism professor.</strong></p> <p>I was a year ahead of him. I invited him and his roommate Hasan Chandoo, who I started dating, to dinner, and they showed up looking crisp and fresh-faced. I'd go to student parties round their house; I remember dancing to 'Once in a Lifetime' by Talking Heads in a sea of people. </p> <p>Barry was a focused, dedicated student and an earnest, sincere person, but he wasn't too serious to talk about the fun stuff. We'd hang out and talk about what was happening in class and who was dating whom. He goofed around with the rest of us. He was engaging and perhaps even charismatic, but I wasn't aware of him being a playboy. He was friends with women who were impressive feminists as well as people who were more socially focused. He straddled groups: the arts/literary crowd, which tended to stick together, and the political activist crowd, likewise. He belonged to both.</p> <p>I studied in a creative writing class with him. I remember him submitting a poem called 'Pop' (since published in the New Yorker). It was a penetrating portrait of his grandfather, in which his grandfather asked him what he was going to do with his life. </p> <p>I was also at the rally where he gave his first speech, an anti-apartheid rally at Occidental. He was hunched over the mike, it was too low for him. He was nervous and he was rushing a little. I recall him saying something like: 'Occidental should spend less time investing in South Africa and more time on multicultural education.' That was impressive because you think of multiculturalism as a Nineties phenomenon, and here he was in the early Eighties, thinking about the need for that in an educational sense.</p> <p>It didn't occur to anyone this guy could become President. He certainly didn't go around saying anything that audacious or ambitious. He was a nose-to-the-grindstone, quiet worker, not the kind who would run around tooting his own horn, even though he was probably getting messages from his professors that he had serious talent. I think he was figuring out who he would be and when he left Occidental he took the steps to become that person. It's like Shakespeare's line: 'Some are born great, some achieve greatness and some have greatness thrust upon them.' He was the guy who achieved greatness and it clearly took a lot of hard work to do that.</p> <h2>Chicago 1980s: Auma Obama</h2> <p><strong>Obama's Kenyan half-sister, who first met Barack in the Eighties. Worked in children's services in Reading, UK but has since moved to Nairobi.</strong></p> <p>We used to see photos of Barack as he was growing up in America. My father always talked about him, that Barack would come home to Kenya some day. </p> <p>He would say to us: 'You've got to write to your brother Barry' and obviously as a child you think: 'Oh yeah, OK, all right', but you're not really that fussed, so I didn't make any contact. </p> <p>It was actually Barack who contacted me first, after the death of our father. I was in Germany, studying in Heidelberg, and he wrote to me. He has the same name and handwriting as our father so when I looked at the back of the letter I had this shiver go up my spine. We corresponded for a while and then I went over to the US to see a friend. It was the mid-Eighties. I had decided to visit Barack as his guest in Chicago. </p> <p>I was nervous. I was very close to my dad and Barack was a piece of him that I hadn't known. What if we did not get along? Well, I wasn't disappointed. We just got into the car, his little car, and started talking and never stopped. It was a very intense 10 days together.</p> <p>Barack was a community organiser. He was just a small person, a nobody, but he had the same intensity he has today. He was disturbed by the status quo and was working at the grassroots to see what was going wrong. I was very active in political awareness work in Germany and I saw that he had the same energy and passion to make a difference and to change people's lives. </p> <p>For me it was: 'Wow, this is like Christmas', where you get this huge, big present of somebody who actually understands what you are saying, where you're coming from. </p> <p>Later, I moved back home for a year to work as a tutorial fellow at the University in Nairobi. Barack visited Kenya for the first time. I picked him up in my Beetle. He did not have any of these hang-ups, you know: 'Oh there are mosquitoes.' He came and just was. It made it so easy. We spent a lot of time discussing and explaining things. </p> <p>I don't know if it was strange for Barack to come here. The thing is it wasn't strange for the family. Nobody but me had met Barry but everybody knew him from our father. We don't dramatise family in Kenya and people weren't fazed by him at all, although they did find some things interesting. For my grandmother, it was his accent and the fact that he could not speak Luo. </p> <p>And all the kids would come and compare their skin colour to Barack's. People had many questions for him and Barack definitely had many questions for them. There was never a moment of silence or embarrassed awkwardness. </p> <p>It wasn't all nice. Sometimes, he wanted to see relatives I didn't really get along with and he'd be like: 'It's my right and I need to see them and I'm not going alone and you're coming with me'. </p> <p>To take a break, we went to the coast. Coming back (from Mombasa to Nairobi) we travelled by bus. The driver was going so fast and I was so, so scared. Barack took it all in his stride. I, the Kenyan who should have been used to it, was furious at the driver. But Barack was just like: 'OK, this is the adventure that it is.' He came with this big baggage of tolerance and relaxedness and the ability to just absorb. </p> <p>When I went to his wedding [in the US, in 1992] I could see that people were very impressed with him. People listened to him. I could see that a lot of them were people of prominence and thinkers in the community. </p> <p>Today, I still see the same Barack I first met. At home, he's the same, very normal person. </p> <p>Politically, he's now a big shot, but there's an expression that says a big shot is a small shot who never stopped shooting. He was shooting back then - not in the sense the Republicans would use it, with a rifle - but in that he was always working, and people came on board and slowly more and more people understood that what this guy is trying to do is going to make a difference to America and the American people.</p> <p>Sometimes, I'm awed by what he has achieved. I'm very, very proud of him. I have to keep reminding myself: 'Oh he's just my little brother' just to bring it back to reality and make sure that I don't get too excited about who I am because of what he's done.</p> <h2>Chicago 1985: Gerald Kellman</h2> <p><strong>Employed Obama as a community organiser at the Calumet Community Religious Conference, Chicago, 1985-88. </strong></p> <p>I met Barack at a coffee shop on Lexington Avenue, New York. He was a year out of Columbia and he'd just quit a job working as a journalist for a business publication.</p> <p>One of his preoccupations was being a novelist and he had taken the journalism job to facilitate that. He wrote a number of short stories about his experiences, other people's lives and their struggles. I read a couple and I thought they were pretty good. He's a wonderful writer by non-professional standards, but he knew he wasn't up with his heroes. </p> <p>So he'd applied to work for my group as a community organiser in the impoverished South Side of Chicago. The Calumet region of Chicago was the largest producer of steel in the country. When the mills shut down, the jobs went, gangs and drugs became huge and the place unravelled.</p> <p>Barack had grown up as an outsider, without a father, as an American kid living abroad and separated from his mother at high school. Outsiders do one of two things: try to be like everyone else or identify with other outsiders. Barack did the latter. He was reflective and willing to identify with people in poverty, with people who faced discrimination.</p> <p>He was also idealistic. He had been inspired by Dr Martin Luther King and the civil rights movement, but he was a decade or so too late for it and this was the closest he could get.</p> <p>I was offering him $10,000 a year and two grand for a car and I remember thinking: someone who was smart enough to do it should have been smart enough not to do it. The salary was ridiculous, the status low, the prospects bad and he had to move to Chicago. The way I convinced him was to talk about the Calumetians' lives and he wanted to see what he could do to help them. Barack is often motivated by a desire to learn, and he was hungry for hands-on experience.</p> <p>Chicago's South Side contains the largest black community in the States. Barack's job was to go into the community and interview individuals to find out what the problems were and then teach them the public skills to get change and that if they were to get anywhere the community needed to work together. Barack had to give people confidence and he did it brilliantly because he listened. He's a remarkably quick learner and not at all snobbish about whether he learns from people of high or low status.</p> <p>In community organising, people often don't like each other. The less there is, the more people tend to grasp for it. One day, Barack noticed that the city had removed asbestos from the manager's office of the Altgeld housing estate, but not from the residents' flats. People were so incensed by the inequity that they were more than ready to organise. They drove down to Springfield to confront the politicians and it got that area of Chicago mobilised in a way they never had been before.</p> <p>I think a lot of his orientation was formed in his time as an organiser. Local politicians and clergy felt our group was a potential threat and Barack had to decide when to compromise and when not to, when to be confrontational and when to be collaborative and those parts of his character were shaped during his organising career.</p> <p>He was resilient and good at turning things around. Always, when things were going badly, Barack would stay up most of the night, trying to figure things out. And by the next day he'd be meeting people and we'd be trying an alternative strategy.</p> <p>We socialised together. He would come over for dinner at our house and we played tennis together. He was neat for a young man. His afro had been cropped by that time and he would wear button-down, short-sleeve shirts, slacks and shoes. He couldn't afford to take his shirt to the laundry but it always looked neatly pressed. His apartment was also very neat, almost monastic, without much furniture and filled with books. He was very thin, skinnier than he is now. Women would regularly invite him home to dinner to try to fatten him up, but it didn't work.</p> <p>Three years after he'd started work for us, we were walking around at a conference at the Harvard divinity school in Cambridge and he said he'd decided to leave organising for law school. He didn't see organising making the big differences that he felt were needed. He hadn't met Michelle yet, but he wanted a family and he didn't want the uncertainty of the low salary. I thought his reasons were good and that he'd done a great job.</p> <p>He was open to learning about the church. As for his personal orientation towards God, he was working that out too. He was influenced by the kind of people he was meeting and the role that faith played in their lives. He was moving from an intellectual understanding to a more visceral and experiential understanding.</p> <h2>Jakarta 1980s: Julia Surakusuma</h2> <p><strong>Close friend of Obama's mother, Jakarta, Indonesia, 1981 to 1995 . Sociologist and feminist writer. </strong></p> <p>Ann was very proud of Barry. She was very close to her children and spoke very warmly about them. There aren't many mothers who could create their children in the way she created him.</p> <p>I always resent the suggestion that she was not a good mother because Barry went back to Hawaii to live with his grandparents when he was 10. It was precisely because she was a good mother that she made that choice, to do what was best for him. It was a very painful decision for her but they contacted each other as frequently as possible.</p> <p>Both Barry and his sister, Maya, are the living incarnation of what is best about their mother. Often, it's really painful for me to watch him on television because I can see his mother in him. </p> <p>Ann was very smart and, in many ways, a pioneer. She was really brave, even revolutionary, to have married entirely outside her culture. She was a rebel in a way, but not confrontational. They are the same qualities you see in Barry. The fact that he wants to work for the community, that was his mum. The people's person side of him, that was his mum.</p> <p>Ann and Barry have 'fire', but in the case of Ann, it was tempered by her earthy, motherly nature, whereas with Barry, he's more 'air' and expresses his passion more through his intellect. I met him two or three times when he came to visit his mum in Jakarta when he was in his early twenties. I remember him coming into the living room and sitting on the arm of the sofa. I remember so well his smile and his personality. He was charismatic even then.</p> <h2>Harvard 1989: Larry Tribe</h2> <p><strong>University professor of constitutional law, who taught Obama, and for whom Obama worked as a research assistant.</strong></p> <p>Barack came to see me during his first year at Harvard. It was 31 March 1989. I found my desk calendar and I'd written his name with an exclamation point. From the late 1960s, when I began teaching as a professor at Harvard Law School, until the present, there has been no other student whose name I've noted in that way.</p> <p>He impressed me from the beginning as an extraordinary young man. He was obviously brilliant, driven and interested in pursuing ideas with a clear sense that his reasons for being in law school were not to climb some corporate ladder, nor simply to broaden his opportunities, but to go back to the community. </p> <p>He had a combination of intellectual acumen, open-mindedness, resistance to stereotypical thinking and conventional presuppositions. He also had a willingness to change his mind when new evidence appeared, confidence in his own moral compass and a maturity that obviously came from some combination of his upbringing and earlier experience.</p> <p>I asked him to be my research assistant, a role he filled for a year and a half. We had a much more vibrant dialogue than one typically has with a research assistant. He was witty, he had a lighthearted touch and even though we were dealing with some pretty grave and weighty subjects, it was always a breezy thing to talk to him. </p> <p>He had a charismatic quality and was very engaging. Other students gravitated towards him and liked him rather than envying him or wanting to compete with him. </p> <p>Typically in a place as competitive as Harvard or Yale, one student will make a comment and another student will try and one-up him by saying something cleverer or wittier. But Barack would never put anyone else down. If a student expressed a view he didn't agree with, he nevertheless saw the value in it and built on it. </p> <p>He found points of communality and gave people the sense that he could see where they were coming from, and what their core beliefs were, and why they were worthy of respect. It was really a precursor to the way he engages in dialogue across ideological and partisan divisions. </p> <p>In his second year, he became the first African American president of the Harvard Law Review [one of the leading law journals in the world]. It was a position which represented the judgment of his peers about his intellectual acumen and his leadership capacities. He emerged with the enthusiastic backing of other students. In no sense was this some kind of affirmative action; he was chosen as the best person people could find.</p> <p>We used to take long walks on the Charles River in Boston. Our conversations were enormously wide-ranging and enjoyable, about life in general, not just about work. I had no doubt as I got to know him that he had an unlimited future. I didn't have a clear sense of what direction it would take, but I thought it would be political and I thought the sky was the limit.</p> <p>He had a personal quality which was transcendent and I continued to feel that way about him each time we met. And the quality he demonstrated that I've always been left with more than any other is authenticity. There isn't a fibre of phoniness about this guy.</p> <h2>Illinois 1996: Senator Terry Link</h2> <p><strong>A friend of Obama since they played poker and golf together at the Capitol, Springfield, Illinois in the 1990s. </strong></p> <p>We came into the Illinois Senate together in 1996, were seat mates - we sat next to one another on the Senate floor - and office mates - our offices were adjacent. The Senate schedule had us in Springfield away from our families on Wednesday nights. </p> <p>I don't drink at all, Barack would have a beer once in a while, so we didn't carouse the bars like lots of the others. You could say that we were both measured personalities. So I said: 'Why don't we have a card game?' We called it the 'Committee Meeting' but there was no shop talk allowed. We had seven or eight Republicans and Democrats and it was a time to get to know one another out of the shadows of the Capitol. We'd take the suits and ties off, sit back and have a night of relaxing. It was low-stakes poker: a dollar stake, three dollar top raise. No one was going to lose their mortgage or house. Barack wore sweat pants and a baseball cap, drank a beer and would cadge a few cigarettes.</p> <p>If his style of poker is like how he'll run the White House I'll sleep well at night. He is very conscious of the odds. If he thought he had a chance of winning he'd stay in the game; if he thought not he'd fold straight away. He read and played the field very well. He was serious at it.</p> <p>There was another player, Larry Walsh, a relatively conservative Democrat. Barack trumped his four of a kind with a higher four of a kind to take the pot and Walsh threw his cards down. 'Doggone it, Barack,' he said. 'If you were more liberal in your card playing and more conservative in your politics, we'd get along much better.'</p> <p>Barack's golf game was terrible at first, that's probably the nicest way to say it. I'm an avid golfer. He hated losing to me. He's so competitive and his frustration got so bad that he went out and took lessons. His game improved a lot but I still beat him.</p> <p>As Republicans controlled the House it was a monumental task to get legislation passed. Barack could forge relations with others very well. He was very even-keeled, even when bullied on the Senate floor. It frustrated him, but he always kept his cool. His demeanour was: 'I'm going to explain this, I'm not going to get into a fist fight about this.'</p> <p>One of his biggest preoccupations was healthcare and he worked very hard with the Republicans to say: 'This is something advantageous to your party as well.' When we took a majority in 2002, he became chairman of public health, but he kept his relationships with the Republicans; the last thing he was going to do was say: 'I'm in charge and I forget you guys.' The old chairman of public health used to have meetings in City Hall, but Barack would take the meetings out and about to the people.</p> <p>I saw his daughters being born and I know his wife Michelle very well. She is a very level-headed individual and she keeps Barack's feet on the ground.</p> <h2>London 2008: David Lammy</h2> <p><strong>British MP and Minister of State for Higher Education; friend of Obama's since 2005. </strong></p> <p>I first met him at Harvard at an event for black alumni from all over the world. There was lots for us to talk about because we share similar heritage; my family are from Guyana, half his family are from Kenya, we're both black, we're both politicians in western democracies; but beyond law and politics there was lots of synergy. </p> <p>What I found interesting about Obama is his reach beyond America. He has an acute understanding of developing countries.</p> <p>He is someone who I find it very easy to get along with. He's incredibly charming and funny. He's clearly got an obsession with ties because whenever he meets me he talks about the ties that British people wear. I'll be wearing something with loud colours, and in America they are a bit more straightforward, and he makes light of that. He'll go: 'Look at my tie compared to yours!' - this coming from one of the coolest men in the world! </p> <p>There have been moments where he's rung me up over the past few years, and he's been sincere and very calm. He's not someone that gets into a flap or displays any anxiousness, even though sometimes those conversations have been in the heat of anxious situations.</p> <p>I met him this February when he had just come out of Super Tuesday. We were in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, very much rural America, and he gave a speech in the university. He went down really well but what struck me was that, despite his hectic schedule, backstage he wanted to thank every local official: he spent a good 20 minutes with all of them. He then started to walk me around, introducing me to them, and I was a bit 'I'm not really terribly important', but he was determined that they should meet the Minister for Skills in the UK. </p> <p>When I saw him I felt he'd been emboldened and strengthened by his experiences. He always had charisma and a relaxed, personable style, but a few years later one can see his growth as a presidential candidate and a man. </p> <p>We've got a professional friendship; we haven't been golfing together. I don't think he's got enough time for that, and actually neither have I. But his faith is very important to him, and that's something I have had some affinity with and that we reflect on. He has also lost both his parents, and he was very gracious when my mother died of ovarian cancer earlier this year; he had lost his mother to the same illness. </p> <p>Like all inquisitive, curious and interesting politicians, he is someone who can scan the horizons of many different issues and can find politics in cultural situations - the sadness of death, the experience of living in a developing country and what that means, or economic hardship in rural middle America. He is someone who has a strong emotional intelligence as well as a strong cognitive intelligence.</p> <h2>The rise of Barack Obama</h2> <p><strong>Early life and education</strong></p> <p><strong>1961</strong> Born 4 August in Honolulu, Hawaii to Barack Obama Sr, a Kenyan and Ann Dunham, a white American anthropologist.

  "<p>Barcelona has paid homage to the last few survivors of the International Brigades volunteers who fought to defend Spain against the fascist-backed General Francisco Franco during the 1936-39 civil war.</p> <p>At ceremonies across the city yesterday the handful of survivors, now mostly in their nineties, were f\u00eated to mark the 70th anniversary of the brigades' departure from Spain. They were reminded that at their official send-off from Barcelona in 1938 they had been told: 'You are history. You are legend ... We will not forget you.'</p> <p>'They've stuck to that. It's a hero's return,' said Jack Edwards, aged 94, who travelled to Spain as a 21-year-old in 1936. 'I was sad when I left, because I had made so many friends.'</p> <p>Four of the 23 surviving brigade members who made it to Barcelona yesterday were British, including the former Transport and General Workers Union leader Jack Jones.</p> <p>The homage came as Spain became further entangled in a bitter dispute about how it should deal with crimes from the civil war after the crusading judge Baltasar Garz\u00f3n opened the way for what could be the first prosecutions of Franco's henchmen.</p> <p>Campaigners and experts in international law yesterday told The Observer that the judge, even though he only named 35 deceased Franco generals and ministers, has now made it possible for those still alive who were involved in Franco's repression to be placed on trial.</p> <p>That would be unprecedented in a country which has so far refused to seek justice for crimes committed in Franco's name, either during the war or in his 36-year dictatorship. It would go further than even campaigners originally intended.</p> <p>'This opens the door,' said David Sugarman, professor of law at Lancaster University, who has been watching Garz\u00f3n since he had Chile's General Augusto Pinochet arrested in London on similar charges in 1998. 'I can't believe he does not know where this is taking him. The Pandora's box is opened.'</p> <p>The key element of the judge's decision has been to declare that, where a person was detained and later disappeared, a crime of kidnapping is still being carried out today if their body has not been found. Thousands of 'disappeared' political opponents were marched off by Franco's death squads and never seen again. Anyone who took part in such a kidnapping can now be put on trial. Courts in Chile have used the same criteria to convict hundreds of those involved in the Pinochet regime.</p> <p>Spanish campaigners now also recognise that Garz\u00f3n's decision may lead to trials. 'Where there is a crime and a perpetrator, the judge will have to do something about it,' said Emilio Silva, of the Association for the Recovery of Historical Memory.</p> <p>A lot will now depend on whether campaigners decide it is time to denounce those involved in the repression to the courts. The realisation that trials may eventually follow helps to explain why state-appointed lawyers are trying hard to prevent Garz\u00f3n from continuing his investigation by appealing to higher judicial authorities.</p> <p>'It seems a political reaction in defence of the government,' Silva said.</p>",
  "<p>Friday is gay wedding day at San Francisco City Hall, one of those examples of American monumental architecture for which the word 'grandiose' might have been invented. One by one, the couples make their way past the security guards and metal detectors, through the vast rotunda and up the marble staircase to a smaller, domed area where most of the ceremonies take place.</p> <p>Like all couples on their big day, they are beaming, locking eyes as they pledge to share a lifetime together. But they are also in a hurry. 'We'd been thinking about this step very seriously for a long time,' says one tall, dark-haired woman - a college professor who moved with her partner to San Francisco from Kentucky. 'But we wanted to make sure we could get married before election day.'</p> <p>In California, election day - a week on Tuesday - will not just decide whether Barack Obama or John McCain wins the White House. In an echo of the culture wars that have dominated US politics for the past four decades, a separate ballot initiative - opposed by Obama with the caveat that he personally favours only gay 'civil unions', but endorsed by McCain - could shut the door on same-sex weddings in the city that first sanctioned them four years ago. </p> <p>Supporters of the ballot, known as 'Proposition Eight', call it the 'Marriage Protection Act'. If passed, it would undo the latest twist in a long-running battle over gay marriages - the California Supreme Court's recent ruling that barring such ceremonies violates the state constitution's equal rights provisions - by amending the basic law to define marriage in California as valid 'only between a man and a woman'.</p> <p>In an extraordinary example of life imitating art, the nail-biting conclusion to the campaign over 'Prop 8' coincides with the launch of one of the most eagerly awaited movies of the year. It is a biopic starring Oscar-winning actor Sean Penn as the San Francisco city supervisor who, most probably more than anyone else, was responsible for the seismic political changes that allowed gay couples to marry.</p> <p>His name was Harvey Milk. Three decades ago, his capture of a seat on the Board of Supervisors made him the first openly gay person to win elected city office in America. He served for just 11 months and the political high point of his time in office was to lead the battle to defeat another ballot proposition - Proposition Six of 1978 - that would have led to the sacking of all openly gay teachers in California's state schools.</p> <p>While few of the dozens of couples celebrating their City Hall weddings seem to notice, they are reciting their vows a dozen paces from a recently installed bronze bust of Milk - and only a few steps farther from the spot where, on 27 November, 1978, he and the city's then mayor, George Moscone, were gunned down and killed by an embittered conservative council rival.</p> <p>'Harvey Bernard Milk, 1930-1978', the inscription reads. Harvey is smiling - partly, his friends like to think, from the infectious joy he took in shaking up a political establishment where old money, old interests and old prejudices were resisting the tide of change; partly at seeing how far the changes he championed have since taken root; and partly, too, in wonder at the imminent prospect of becoming not just a San Francisco gay icon but a fully fledged member of America's national political pantheon.</p> <p>Next Tuesday evening, the red carpet will be rolled out in front of the Castro Theatre, the movie house at the heart of San Francisco's main gay neighbourhood. Penn, who lives across the San Francisco Bay, will be there. So will James Franco, of Spider-Man fame, who plays his gay lover Scott Smith, and a host of other prominent names on both sides of the camera who helped make the film - the latest in a number of previous efforts that have run aground since the moving 1984 documentary The Times of Harvey Milk won an Oscar in 1985. </p> <p>The political life and violent death of Harvey Milk represented a golden age for this formerly working-class Irish neighbourhood, changed for ever by an influx of gay people from around the country in the late 1960s and 1970s. Known simply as The Castro, the area occupies a few colourful blocks that stretch from the major thoroughfare of Market Street towards the pricey residential area of Noe Valley. </p> <p>The Penn movie, entitled Milk, has for local residents and the city's liberal communities become both a validation of all that Harvey Milk set in train and a reminder of how fragile some of those gains may still prove to be. </p> <p>When filming began early this year, a crowd gathered to watch the crews recreate the shop fronts and street architecture of three decades ago. 'It was like a bizarre dream,' laughs Martha Asten, who with her husband, Ernie, runs a family hardware store established in the 1930s and became close friends with Milk. The crowds swelled further when Penn and Franco staged a long kiss on a Castro sidewalk. 'After our kiss, Sean texted Madonna - his ex-wife - and said, \"I just broke my cherry kissing a guy. I thought of you. I don't know why\",' Franco quipped in an interview with the gay magazine Out. 'And then she wrote back and said, \"Congratulations\".'</p> <p>Those who knew Milk see the real value of the film in recapturing his political vision, fierce commitment to civil rights and raw political skills. It is a message they hope will resonate both with new generations of gay people and a much wider audience.</p> <p>'Harvey Milk,' says Matthew Bajko, the assistant editor on the city's main gay paper, the Bay Area Reporter, 'was like Barack Obama 30 years before him - lighting a fire for people who really didn't believe in politics.' </p> <p>Milk grew up in a middle-class Jewish community on Long Island. He served in the Navy and was a stock analyst on Wall Street before a connection through one of his boyfriends brought him to the fringe of a series of productions, including Hair and Jesus Christ Superstar. Then, at the start of 1970s, a long-haired Milk moved west with Scott Smith.</p> <p>They opened a camera store on Castro Street - now an upmarket gift and home accessories shop. But from the start, as the journalist Randy Shilts says in his definitive biography, it was clear that Milk's love for 'theatre' had finally been married with a cause: politics. His central message was of gay identity and pride. The alternative for homosexuals, he said, was often fear, guilt, closeted agony, even suicide. To the few influential gay voices on the city's political scene, he insisted that waiting for mainstream liberal allies to advance gay rights was short-sighted, cowardly and wrong.</p> <p>Still, from the outset - long before he had cut his hair, built a strong local base and won election at his fourth attempt in 1977 - Milk demonstrated a broader message and a genius, at both grassroots level and through a mainstream media that had all but ignored 'gay stories', of getting his message heard. 'The very first time I saw him,' Asten recalls, 'Harvey was campaigning up on 18th Street and Castro - this guy with long hair, a hippie. He was up on a park bench or something and talking, and I'm walking past and I stop to listen. And I said, this is the first politician that really spoke to me.' </p> <p>They joined Milk in his attempts to get businesses to help create a common Castro identity, embracing both the new tide of gay immigrants and established residents. Milk also made a breakthrough with traditionally anti-gay union leaders when he helped reinvigorate a campaign to boycott Coors beer by getting all the neighbourhood gay bars on board.</p> <p>But it was not just this 'coalition building' that marked out Milk, according to Tom Ammiano, a former teacher in The Castro who first worked with him during the campaign against Prop Six. Now one of two gay members of the Board of Supervisors, he says: 'Harvey saw beyond the gay issue. He saw that gays, and others, cared about housing, rent control, police reform.' </p> <p>As supervisor, Milk successfully led support for a gay rights ordinance. He also launched campaigns for better transport and support of other minority groups and senior citizens. Still, the apogee of his period in office was his role in the campaign to defeat the ballot proposition against gay teachers. For weeks, despite opinion polls predicting a landslide defeat as the national mood swung against gay rights, he debated with supporters across California.</p> <p>Outgunned financially, he delivered an Obama-like appeal for gays and civil rights allies to send in 'just one dollar' each to fund the fightback. He joined Ammiano and others in knocking on doors and stopping voters on the street in an attempt to warn them about the underlying civil rights implications. And on the night they defeated Proposition Six, resoundingly.</p> <p>With Proposition Eight looming, Milk's friends hope Penn's movie will bring back the vivid memories of him they all seem to share. The first is of the public celebration after his two most important and improbable triumphs - winning city office in 1977 and leading the fight against Prop Six the following year. The second was of the city's shock and grief after he was killed, which brought together tens of thousands of people - gay and straight - on a candle-lit march through the city.</p> <p>But the final memory, they agree, is the most important. Asten calls it Milk's ability to reach out to those in need. 'He was not just about gays,' she says, adding: 'He would have been there campaigning against this ridiculous Prop Eight.' Milk 'was about helping the underdog... If they had a right, something they were being trampled on, that's where he was.'</p> <p>Ammiano says that Milk conveyed the significance of the Proposition Eight battle in what became known as his 'hope speech' - inspired by a phone call from a young gay man in Altoona, Pennsylvania, after his election victory. 'He said thanks,' Milk told his audience, adding that his election might provide 'hope for a better tomorrow'. Without hope, he said, 'not only gays, but the blacks, the Asians, the disabled, the seniors, give up... And you and you and you, you've gotta give 'em hope!'</p> <p>That, Ammiano says, was one lesson Milk can deliver afresh through Sean Penn - accompanied by another important lesson learnt during his election defeats. 'If, God forbid, Prop Eight passes, there's another chapter. We will return to it. We - along with a growing number of straight allies - are not going to go away.'</p> <h2>Life of a trailblazer</h2> <p>Harvey Milk was born on 22 May, 1930, in Woodmere, Long Island.</p> <p>He attended New York State Teachers College in Albany, and spent four years in the US Navy after graduating in 1951. After a brief period as a high school teacher, he went on to work as a stock analyst on Wall Street before moving to San Francisco, California.</p> <p>He ran for office three times before being voted on to the city's Board of Supervisors in 1977, the first openly gay person to win city office in America. </p> <p>In mid-1978, he led a successful campaign to defeat a ballot proposition - Proposition Six - which would have barred gays from teaching in California's state schools. </p> <p>On 27 November, 1978, a right-wing former colleague on the Board of Supervisors, Dan White, entered city hall and shot dead Milk and the mayor, George Moscone.</p>",
  "<p>In 1949, all light entertainment broadcasts on the BBC were made subject to a set of decency rules known, by the colour of the volume in which they were inscribed, as the 'Green Book'. It stipulated: 'an absolute ban on ... jokes about lavatories, effeminacy in men, immorality of any kind; suggestive references to honeymoon couples, chambermaids, fig leaves, ladies' underwear e.g. winter draws on; animal habits e.g. rabbits, lodgers, commercial travellers.'</p> <p>The ban was lifted 14 years later, in the year that Philip Larkin would later identify as the one of collectively lost virginity: 'Sexual intercourse began/ In nineteen-sixty-three/ (which was rather late for me)/ Between the end of the Chatterley ban/ and the Beatles' first LP'</p> <p>Sex is the syllable that hooks you into Larkin's over-quoted verse. But the really vital word - the subversive word - is 'intercourse'. It is a collision between the idea of social communication and private intimacy; it means conversation and penetration. </p> <p>Somewhere between postwar austerity and Woodstock, copulation went public. That process is usually feted with a jail-break metaphor: sexual liberation.</p> <p>Since then sex has become progressively freer. Images that would have been considered obscene two generations ago, are now sprawled 10ft high on billboards. Everything from chocolate to shower gel is sold with the implication that it gives quasi-orgasmic pleasure to the consumer. </p> <p>Surely this is the end of a road. Every phrase, act, body part whose representation was taboo in media even a decade ago, has now been broadcast on the BBC. What limits remain in the mainstream are blurred in the multi-channel world of cable and satellite TV; they do not even exist online. A broadband connection is all that are required to explore every permutation of sexual activity, free to view, free from shame. </p> <p>For decades now that process has seemed unstoppable and irreversible. And who would want it stopped or reversed? It is certainly hard to imagine a majority of British people today allowing politicians and clerics to police the boundaries of public morality as they once did. But it isn't just zealots and prudes who question whether or not things might have gone too far. With any currency or commodity, over-production leads to inflation and devaluation. If that happens to sex, aren't our public life and our culture somehow impoverished? </p> <p>There is still some limit to supply; some censorship. You will never see an erect penis on primetime television. The pretence that children under 18 are forbidden from watching certain movies is still quaintly upheld. (As if they don't swap the most graphic highlights phone-to-phone in the playground). </p> <p>But obscenity law and censorship before the Sixties were meant to reinforce a more pervasive social opprobrium. Subversion and titillation in plays, films and books worked by testing the boundaries of that cultural austerity. Now we live in an age of sexual profligacy. The function of law is judged not to be the protection of collective morals, but of individuals. Occasionally that means regulators upholding complaints about sexual material being used 'gratuitously'; but that generally means it was displayed or broadcast in a way that deprived the public of a reasonable choice to avoid it. It was on the side of a building or shown before the watershed.</p> <p>Mostly the law is used to stop (or try to stop) sexual representations that break other laws - chiefly the abuse and exploitation of children. By and large, everything that takes place between consenting adults is allowed. </p> <p>That is a good thing. </p> <p>The original impetus behind the sexual revolution was both moral and political. Puritan sexual squeamishness was considered by Sixties liberals to be hypocritical and repressive. They argued that the culture of shame in relation to all things sexual was promoted by a class-based establishment that feared openness in any area of public life as a threat to its authority. Sex and obscenity were, in the eyes of that establishment, inseparable from the idea of vulgarity - the moral corrosion of the nation perpetrated by the lower orders. </p> <p>So getting sex into media and the arts was the cultural front in a wider progressive battle, the same one that fought for decriminalising homosexuality; legalising abortion; ending censorship. </p> <p>The publisher's defence in the Lady Chatterley trial, in fact the only defence allowed under the 1959 Obscene Publications Act, was that the book was a work of demonstrable 'literary merit'. Material that could not be proved as art was assumed to be 'liable to deprave and corrupt.'</p> <p>But the argument was not so much won by the defence as lost by the chief prosecutor when he asked the court if Lady Chatterley's Lover was 'the kind of book you would want your wife or servants to read.'</p> <p>Members of the jury, not being in a position to employ staff, decided that the only way to judge its potential to accelerate social decay would be to read it themselves - and to allow everyone else the same privilege.</p> <p>Once established in the world of books, the 'art not porn' principle was soon applied to the West End. The 1968 Theatres Act removed the power of the Lord Chamberlain, a royal appointee, to shut down blasphemous and obscene plays, prompting a rush of nudity onto the national stage. </p> <p>But for all that the liberal intelligentsia might have congratulated itself for prodding the establishment into incremental reform, the revolution was actually driven - even in the Sixties - by market forces. The twin agents of change were then and still largely are music and television.</p> <p>In 1955, ITV was launched. Before then, broadcasting was the monopoly of the BBC and it was run long the founding principles of the corporation's first director-general John Reith, a strict Presbyterian. </p> <p>While ITV also had a public service mandate, it was less uptight and not embarrassed by populism. Crucially, ITV was quicker than the BBC to grasp the commercial power of rock'n'roll. Both channels tried to do music broadcasting but it was ITV's Ready Steady Go! (1963-66) that became essential viewing for the generation that was about to be truly, sexually liberated.</p> <p>And it was rock'n'roll that did it. It was the penetration of subversive pop music into people's homes, via the TV, that did more than anything else to challenge taboo, aggravate moral conservatives and push the boundaries of public decency, from Elvis's gyrations and Mick Jagger's leer, via Jimi Hendrix humping a guitar, through the Sex Pistols' profanity and Frankie Goes to Hollywood - banned by the BBC for singing 'Relax, don't do it, when you want to come'. That was 1984. </p> <p>The music industry has been so important for pushing back sexual boundaries because it has been so adept at commercialising offensive manners. Whenever a youth cult has appeared that might challenge received norms of reputable behaviour, record company executives have co-opted the revolution, packaged it as a lifestyle brand and sold it back to the punks on the barricade.</p> <p>The music business was the first to decide that standards of decency could be set by the market instead of political or religious doctrine. But in the Eighties, the whole of British society was reconfigured by the same ethos. The entire economy was reoriented towards finding the most efficient way to satisfy consumer appetites. Because sex sells, a dramatic liberalisation of carnality was inevitable.</p> <p>That was not what Margaret Thatcher intended. She was an old-fashioned moralist who extolled 'Victorian values'. But Thatcher never reconciled an intellectual conflict at the heart of the doctrine that took her name. Economic liberalism and social conservatism clash because freeing business from state control and subjecting it to competition creates incentives to promote the sort of things that guardians of traditional 'family values' find distasteful. The market encourages instant gratification while the essence of sexual conservatism is deferring satisfaction - or denying it.</p> <p>Because Thatcher's Conservatism was socially illiberal, the artistic and cultural elite in Britain continued to see attacking taboo as part of the political struggle of the Sixties. </p> <p>Those cudgels were taken up by Labour after it took power in 1997. While Tony Blair's government disappointed the liberal left on many issues, it did remove some of the vestiges of statutory sexual prejudice: It repealed Section 28 (the bar on teachers 'promoting homosexuality'), it introduced civil partnerships and it lowered the age of consent for gay sex. New Labour gave Britain its first openly gay cabinet minister. </p> <p>Prejudice continued during the Blair years, of course. But the old moral conservatives were shunted out of the cultural mainstream. They formed a reactionary rump, commonly derided for being 'out of touch', bewildered or embittered by the new, modern, licentious Britain.</p> <p>So in the late Nineties social and economic liberalism joined forces. Sexual images floated on the market unregulated by politics. Whenever there were objections raised to the sexualisation of public space, there was a ready ideological rebuttal that combined the moral philosophy of JS Mill and the economics of MH Thatcher: individuals have the right to do as they please so long as no harm is done to others; media and business have the equivalent right to trade in whatever they fancy.</p> <p>The old argument that sex in popular entertainment corrodes public morals has been turned on its head. TV broadcasts that are attacked as degenerate - Big Brother being the favourite target - are defended on the grounds that they reflect contemporary mores, and so serve a useful function. Far from corrupting the masses, sex on TV now apparently edifies the elite.</p> <p>So is that the way things will be from now on? Crude economic logic would suggest that as long as there is a correlation between sex and revenue, the volume of explicit material will increase. Moreover, to maximize the financial return from sex, it is necessary to shock, and that means perpetually pushing back the boundaries. </p> <p>While that has been the trend since the second half of the 20th century, there is historical precedent for cultural shifts in the opposite direction. Georgian England was much more licentious than Victorian England. Scurrilous journals routinely published satirical cartoons lampooning public figures in coitus. Popular illustrations and engravings displayed heaving bosoms, exposed nipples and bulging trousers. Those were all covered up - as, notoriously, were the legs of pianos - by the new, bourgeois, churchy elite created by the Industrial Revolution. </p> <p>From Cromwellian Puritanism to Restoration bawdiness, from Victorian and Edwardian respectability, via wartime austerity to Sixties free love, sex has been alternately glorified and decried. The pendulum could swing again.</p> <p>There is some evidence of a backlash already. Religious groups are become more effective in mobilisation against material they consider offensive. Evangelical Christian lobbying succeeded earlier this year, for example, in forcing Heinz to cancel a TV advertisement that showed two men kissing. </p> <p>It is no surprise that people who think God hates homosexuality get upset by a lot of what is on TV these days. To liberal minds, the religious homophobes are simply on the wrong side of a moral argument, so their views should not be accommodated in public policy.But that is just a continuation of the old argument between permissives and prudes, only with the balance of power reversed. Now it is the religious reactionaries who think their views are suppressed and despised by a secular establishment. </p> <p>There is, however, a more persuasive case against the ubiquity of sex in the public realm. It starts by remembering that market forces are amoral. Consumerism happened to serve the cause of sexual liberation from Sixties onwards, but that doesn't mean it is always an engine for progress. It erodes boundaries that even the most relaxed liberals consider sacrosanct. It pushes back the line, for example, where children become adults, and therefore targets for sexualised marketing.</p> <p>Perhaps it is only on becoming a parent that the extent to which a sexual aesthetic has spread through society becomes alarming: clothes for eight-year-olds that are shrunken versions of outfits designed for 18-year-olds to wear clubbing; Playboy Bunny pencil cases; home pole-dancing kits sold as toys.</p> <p>That last item was the subject of a campaign last year by consumer groups and children's charities against Tesco. The supermarket denied it was encouraging children to learn erotic dancing, but it did remove the kit from its toy department. Likewise, in 2002, Asda withdrew a range of lace underwear for pre-teen girls after complaints that the product imitated designs for adult lingerie. </p> <p>But even aside from sexy products aimed at kids, the normalisation of erotic imagery makes it hard for parents to keep some cordon of innocence around childhood. A walk down the street provides a glut of messages that tell us what women's bodies should look like, and what they are for. The top shelf may be reserved for the hard stuff, but Nuts magazine is practically at toddler height.</p> <p>This is a new culture war over the boundaries of public sex. Sexual intercourse in Britain may have begun in 1963, but it has long since been overtaken by sexual commerce. Liberalism won the battle against the tyranny of the anti-sex fogeys, the church and the 'Green Book'. It hasn't yet found a way to take on the tyranny of the ultra-sexual market.</p> <p>Before that can happen there is a whole vocabulary to be reclaimed from conservatism. Liberals do not feel comfortable with words like 'modesty', 'decency' and 'discretion' when used in the context of sex. They reek of closed-minded piety. But, if not used as a cover for repression, they might describe real virtues. At least there has to be some way for a liberal society to value sex instead of simply hanging a price tag on it.</p> <p>\u2022 Rafael Behr is the chief leader writer of The Observer</p>",
  "<h2>1. Dougie Smith books Paul Gascoigne</h2> <p>Pitiful, pedantic and po-faced, Smith made himself a laughing stock after Gazza returned the yellow card the man from Troon had dropped during Rangers' 7-0 rout of Hibernian in 1995. Witness on YouTube (<a href=\"http://www,tinyurl.com/2psk2c\">tinyurl.com/2psk2c</a>) Gascoigne playfully 'booking' Smith, then his bemused look as this outrages the referee enough for him to call the midfielder back like a naughty schoolboy and then to issue a genuine caution in front of a disbelieving Ibrox. Smith booked seven players in all - and did himself and his refereeing colleagues absolutely no favours.</p> <h2>2. Roy Capey awards a 'ghost' goal</h2> <p>The phantom strike awarded by Stuart Attwell for Watford against Reading's John Eustace in September was just the latest in a grand tradition. While Attwell had seemingly blind assistant Nigel Bannister to thank, in September 1970 Capey was fooled by the stanchions on the back of the Stamford Bridge posts. Alan Hudson's shot rebounded from the outside of the frame of the goal, moving the net, and Capey was convinced the ball had gone in. Ipswich manager Bobby Robson led the on-field protest, but Chelsea won 2-1.</p> <h2>3. Mourad Daami hands Cameroon the Cup</h2> <p>Tunisian referee Daami failed to notice that Victor Ikpeba's penalty for Nigeria in the shootout of the 2000 African Nations Cup final clearly crossed the line after hitting the crossbar. In Nigeria's National Stadium, stunned silence followed as rivals Cameroon won 4-3. 'Nigeria appears to have been prevented from lifting the Cup by the CAF-appointed officials,' announced state television, blaming the African federation's chosen ref and an assistant whose eyesight failed him despite being level with the goalline. Riots followed.</p> <h2>4. Graham Poll's three-card trick</h2> <p>'This is the most bizarre situation I've ever seen in 27 years refereeing,' reckoned Poll when Stuart Attwell awarded Reading that goal at Watford in September. So that's stranger than showing three yellow cards to a player before sending him off, as Poll did to Croatia's Josip Simunic during a match against Australia in the 2006 World Cup? Poll had been a favourite to referee the final. Instead, he was sent home by Fifa or asked for an early bath - depending on whose account you believe - and never refereed an international match again. </p> <h2>5. Robert Hoyzer takes a bribe</h2> <p>Perma-tanned and boasting a tinted mullet, the Berliner ensured third division Paderborn knocked Hamburg out of the German Cup in 2004 by awarding two penalties and sending off Emile Mpenza. Paderborn won 4-2, from 2-0 down; Hamburg manager Klaus Toppm\u00f6ller was later sacked; and, when it emerged Hoyzer had been bribed with \u00a346,000 and a flat-screen television by Croatian hoods, the ref received two years and five months in prison. 'I'm very sorry about all the people I lied to and cheated,' he said.</p> <h2>6. Ali Bin Nasser creates the Hand of God</h2> <p>The second Tunisian referee to feature here, Bin Nasser has cited a haemorrhoid treatment that, apparently, affected his sight and caused him to miss Diego Maradona's blatant handball in 1986. 'Never did I regret having scored in that way,' Argentina's No 10 later said. 'I was waiting for my team-mates to embrace me. I told them, \"Come hug me, or the referee isn't going to allow it.\"' But Bin Nasser saw nothing and Bobby Robson again suffered at a referee's hands as his England side lost the quarter-final 2-1, ending their run at the Mexico World Cup.</p> <h2>7. Clive Thomas's timekeeping denies Zico</h2> <p>The Welsh referee nicknamed 'The Book' had wrongly denied Everton a potential winner in a 1977 FA Cup semi-final and missed a foul that allowed Czechoslovakia to score and knock Holland out of the European Championship a year earlier. But his 1978 World Cup decision trumped everything. Having awarded Brazil a corner in the dying seconds, he then blew for time as Zico's header went in for what would have been the winner. 'On the football field I never had any trouble,' Thomas said when made the Sheriff of Mid Glamorgan in 2004.</p> <h2>8. Ray Wood's broken jaw goes unpunished</h2> <p>'I put in a shoulder charge and he pulled out at the last minute,' said Aston Villa's Peter McParland of his infamous challenge on Manchester United's goalkeeper in the 1957 FA Cup final. McParland actually had ample time to stop himself and should have been sent off by Frank Coultas. Instead, with no substitutes allowed, Wood had to be carried off and Jackie Blanchflower took the gloves after only six minutes. Although a groggy Wood returned as an outfielder in the second half, McParland scored both goals as Villa's 2-1 victory denied the Busby Babes the century's first Double.</p> <h2>9. Kim Milton Nielsen sends off Beckham</h2> <p>A memorable 1998 World Cup encounter exploded when David Beckham decided to kick out at Argentina's Diego Simeone in retaliation after a clear foul, and connected with the faintest of touches. Following much deliberation - and enthusiastic canvassing from Gabriel Batistuta - the Dane acted. 'Many people today forget that it is a red-card offence,' he said, following the strict letter of the law but ignoring the incredulity 'many people' felt at seeing the England No 7 dismissed. Even Argentina's players expected only a caution.</p> <h2>10. The referee gets the gig</h2> <p>How bad for football was the decision to award the referee ultimate power in a game? Until 1891, two umpires were entrusted with making the decisions. If this system had remained, there would have been no Smith, Milton Nielsen, Thomas - or any of the other preening prima donnas who ruin matches. A pair of judges would require consultation, preventing many of these unconsidered, irrational decisions. Would a referee for each half of the pitch, or, say, two on-field assistants to help a primary official really be so revolutionary?</p> <h2>Jamie Jackson defends his selection</h2> <p>Most football supporters would accept that referees have a thankless task. Likewise, while all of us make mistakes, they do not get replayed endlessly: Stuart Attwell's gaffe at Watford in September, when he awarded Reading a goal instead of a corner on a linesman's say-so, will haunt him as long as he blows a whistle. But the men in black could do a lot more to help themselves. Robert Hoyzer was swayed by money, Ali Bin Nasser bottled it in the biggest match of his career and Graham Poll had a farcically bad day. None of those observations excuses them, but Dougie Smith heads this selection because he is the prime example of what many officials, in this observer's opinion, lack: levity; a capacity to relate to players; and the ability to remember that an invisible referee is often best. Smith forgot that it was Paul Gascoigne, a sublime player and born entertainer, that every fan had paid to see. Not him.</p> <p>Disagree?

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/joecalzaghe\">Joe Calzaghe</a> had been to countless weigh-ins, but never quite like this. A world champion for the past decade, he paid his own fare to be at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas on a December day last year. It was not even his fight - <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/rickyhatton\">Ricky Hatton</a> and Floyd Mayweather Jr were the men stepping on the scales before their WBC welterweight title clash.</p> <p>Yet gatecrashing Joe was the one who stole the show.</p> <p>'It was beautiful, man. I knew he'd bite as soon as I saw him in the conference room,' Calzaghe says of his decision to call out Bernard Hopkins. 'When he started his \"I never lose to a white boy\" thing it was done. I thought, \"I tell you what, Bernard, well done mate. You've just made the fight.\"'</p> <p>Hopkins, indeed, had. And when it happened, in April, in the same city, the Welshman won a split decision, despite having been knocked down in the opening round. Hopkins kicked up, but it got him nowhere. Now Calzaghe is nearing the end. He meets Roy Jones Jr at light-heavyweight at Madison Square Garden on 8 November. After 15 years as a professional and 45 undefeated fights, he says it will be his final go inside the ropes. </p> <p>'It gets harder to motivate myself. I don't want to get up in the morning for a run unless I have to fight people I have a bit of a worry about - a Jones or a Hopkins. I've beaten all contenders for 11 years. I'm not a robot, I'm fed up. My body's tired of it. I'm 36.</p> <p>'Boxing's a very lonely sport. That ring is the loneliest place in the world. Especially when your back's against the wall and you sit on your stool after the sixth round and think, \"Jeez, I've got another six to go. And I'm knackered.\" That's happened a lot of times. You can't say, \"Time out, let's have a break.\" You've got a minute then you've got to get your arse back in there. </p> <p>'That takes a special kind of person.'</p> <p>Calzaghe says that fronting Hopkins very publicly into accepting a fight also forced the hand of his now former promoter/manager, Frank Warren. 'He'd sort of agreed for me to fight Clinton Woods. I said, \"I don't want to fight Woods. I want to fight Bernard Hopkins.\" I went to America. I thought I'm getting a ticket and going out there. Because there's nothing like getting head-to-head with the cameras rolling.'</p> <p>It sounds barely credible that a millionaire world champion of long standing had to make the trip himself to ensure he got the opponent he wanted, and Warren's version of events is different.</p> <p>Through his lawyer, Warren points out that Calzaghe was not against fighting Woods, as the fighter made clear in his autobiography. He also says he started attempts to set up a Calzaghe-Hopkins fight as far back as 2003 and that Calzaghe's 'calling out' of Hopkins in Las Vegas only worked against his own interests, as he agreed a fee that Warren might have improved upon through negotiation.</p> <p>There have been differences with Warren and Calzaghe's 12-year association with the promoter ended after he defeated Hopkins. The familiar boxing squabble over contracts and cash is due to be settled in the High Court this week. </p> <p> 'I had no contract after Hopkins and he [Warren] can't take the fact I've left him and want to do my own thing,' says Calzaghe. 'I want to make money for me and my family, see what's on the table. So at the end of the day I'm owed $4.5million. And he's suing me for breach of contract, which is nonexistent. It was a handshake agreement. </p> <p>'I'm disappointed that he's been like this because I feel I've given him 12 years. I'm the one having my head punched in the ring.'</p> <p>Whether the case will reach open court is unclear. Calzaghe's father and trainer, Enzo, is noncommittal, although he echoes his son's disillusionment. 'I just want to train boys, but it's all governed by politics. Litigation - what's all that shit about?'</p> <p>In March 2006 Calzaghe, about to turn 34, at last gained wide recognition, a true understanding, of how special he was when he demolished the feared Jeff Lacey on a memorable night in Manchester.</p> <p>'What pisses me off is people say, \"Oh, you're Calzaghe, you've fought nobody.\"' He then lists opponents he has beaten, starting with Chris Eubank, whom he outpointed to win the WBO super-middleweight belt in 1997. He runs through names such as Robin Reid, Richie Woodhall, Charles Brewer and Byron Mitchell, who gave him his first career knockdown in June 2003. Momentarily, and for the only time in the interview, he becomes defensive: 'You think it's just coincidence I've beaten five former world champions, and they've all just lost their titles? Why is that?' But, as he does in the ring, he rallies strongly: 'They lost their fights on close decisions. I get them cheap, bring them in. It's still a bloody big fight.'</p> <p>Calzaghe remains indignant about how long it took to face Lacey. 'Eight years - come on! Then I took control of my career. I insisted on [Mikkel] Kessler. Warren didn't want me to fight him. He said, \"You'll have to go to Denmark.\" I called his bluff. I said, \"Listen I'll go.\" He went, \"Oh shit I'll make the fight\".' Again, Warren disputes this version of events. He points out that he made a million-dollar offer to Kessler's promoter early in 2007, which failed to draw a response, before promoting the fight in Cardiff last autumn.</p> <p>Kessler, seven years younger than Calzaghe and the undefeated WBA and WBC champion, was dismantled impressively over 12 rounds a month before the trip to see Hopkins in Nevada. It was the performance that finally made Calzaghe the BBC Sports Personality of the Year - alongside Enzo, who won the coach award - having been snubbed in 2006 despite his rout of Lacey. Calzaghe memorably declared: 'Maybe it's because I'm a winner. It seems like the country gets behind losers. Look at people like Greg Rusedski and Tim Henman. What have they won?'</p> <p>Chuckling, he says: 'I said I didn't give a shit - well, I lied. I can say it now I've won it.' Was he surprised? 'Yeah. And proud. Because it was voted by the people. I'd suddenly gone from having no recognition to the ultimate - people saying, \"Bloody hell he's done an amazing thing.\"</p> <p>'My career has been very difficult. People respect the fact that I haven't just turned professional like Amir Khan or Audley Harrison and it's been, \"Here's a million pound\" - for spoilt brats to fight a couple of fights. And they can't do it,' he says of the Olympic medallists whose professional careers have faltered.</p> <p>'You know, I started with Mickey Duff in 1993 and when I left him I was skint. I couldn't pay my mortgage, I had a kid, know what I mean? Everything was hard for me, everything I've worked hard for. That's made me the person I am today; that's why I'm champion for 10 years. Maybe if I had a silver spoon I'd be retired years ago. Boxing's a hungry sport, and I'm still hungry. But recognition is something I probably haven't had. And now all at once it's come, but it's late. I'm 36 - and where I wanted to be 10 years ago. </p> <p>'I haven't got an entourage. I'll go for a beer to my local with my mates. No one wants to kick my head in, no one's going to say I'm a tosser. I'm a regular guy, got the same friends. I live in the same area of south Wales. That's who I am. I'm just a normal guy. I just fight.'</p> <p>Calzaghe, who was born in Hammersmith in 1972, lives in Newbridge, near Newport, and has two children. He struggles to name the fight in which he came closest to losing his proud record. </p> <p>'Hopkins was close. Two judges had it for me by four or five rounds and the woman judged for him. Why are women judging fights? How are you going to give that fight to Hopkins? The guy just held on. Sure I was on my arse in the first round,' he says of the third knockdown of his career. 'But one round don't win the fight.'</p> <p>Hopkins, who last week took apart Kelly Pavlik, the boxer many believed Calzaghe should be fighting rather than Jones Jr, refused to accept the verdict. Has he been in touch since? </p> <p>'No, he's very sour,' Calzaghe says. 'Out of the fighters I've boxed he's probably the most classless. Delusional. If you speak to him he's never lost a fight. And he never lost the fight to me. </p> <p>'All he did was run. And in the 10th, when he feigned that low blow, it was disgusting. He's a cheat. It's not in my make-up to cheat. He tried to get me thrown out because he was blowing out of his arse.'</p> <p>Although Hopkins immediately called for a rematch with Calzaghe after beating Pavlik in Atlantic City, there is little chance of this happening. One theory that may prove to have weight is that, despite Calzaghe being adamant Jones Jr is the end, a close call would tempt him into a second fight against Jones, this time in front of his own fans in Cardiff. Enzo does not deny the prospect. 'After the fight we'll talk about that and see then,' he says.</p> <p>Calzaghe is also sure that Jones Jr, a former four-weight world champion who was considered the best pound-for-pound man of the 1990s, is a credible opponent. 'People say Roy Jones is washed up, he's old,' Calzaghe says of the 39-year-old. 'I'm an old man myself. Someone like Hopkins says, \"I'm a legend, I'm a legend.\" All that shit. Roy Jones is a legend, why the hell wouldn't I want to fight him?</p> <p>'People say I had to fight Pavlik. Who gives a shit about Pavlik? To put the record straight, I've offered him twice - in 2006 and 2007 he declined. Then what happens? I sign to fight Roy Jones and all of sudden he's calling me out.'</p> <p>Calzaghe, who says he took Hopkins lightly - 'I didn't watch tapes of him' - says he will not repeat that mistake next month. 'I'm going to take this fight very, very seriously.' </p> <p>He respects Jones Jr. But can there be too much good feeling between fighters? 'There can be. A prime example was Richie Woodhall. We went back years, our dads were friends. That was really strange. I even stunned him in the first round and didn't follow it up. I always remember in the fight you can see my face change. He hit me, so I stopped him. I felt good I'd won, but sorry for him. </p> <p>'But that's not going to happen with Roy Jones. He's going to want to take my head off in there. I know his psychology. Yes, he'll be your friend now, but he's going to want to rip my face off. I'm not an idiot.'</p> <p>Joe Calzaghe v Roy Jones Jr is live on Setanta Sports 1 on Saturday 8 November (details on setanta.com)</p> <h2>The Undefeated</h2> <p>Rocky Marciano (US) <em>world heavyweight champion 1952-56</em> <strong>Won 49</strong></p> <p>Ricardo Lopez Nava (Mexico) <em>WBC/WBA/WBO strawweight, light-flyweight champion 1990-2002</em> <strong>W51, D1</strong></p> <p>Kim Ji-Won (S Korea) <em>IBF super-bantamweight champion 1985-86</em> <strong>W16, D2</strong></p> <p>Sven Ottke (Germany) <em>super-middleweight champion 1998-2004</em> <strong>W34</strong></p> <p>Terry Marsh (GB) <em>IBF light-welterweight champion 1987</em> <strong>W26, D1</strong></p> <p>Laszlo Papp (Hungary) <em>Three Olympic gold medals 1948-56; fought as pro 1957-64 but barred from world title fights</em> <strong>W27, D2</strong></p> <p>Joe Calzaghe (GB) <em>WBO supermiddleweight 1997-2006, IBF 2006-2007 and 2007 undisputed champion with at least one fight to go</em> <strong>W45</strong></p>",
  "<p>It would take some black-hearted schadenfreude to gloat over Little Britain Matt Lucas's 75-second quickie divorce (official term: dissolution) from his 18-month civil partnership with Kevin McGee. The couple were together six years and it seems like only yesterday they were tying the knot at their pantomime-themed ceremony, dressed as Aladdin and Prince Charming (guys, put it behind you ... behind you!). Still, faced with what is being billed as Britain's 'first celebrity gay divorce', questions are bound to be asked, the first one being, presumably, was this really the best the gay community could do?</p> <p>I am not among those who view gay weddings as a camp travesty of the 'real thing'. (If it's camp you're after, look no further than Trudie Styler arriving on horseback for her marriage to Sting). Nor would it be fair or appropriate to use Lucas's plight to question the sanctity of celebrity gay marriage per se, especially when the 2008 heterosexual version includes Heather Mills barely through with tipping water over Fiona Shackleton's head before Madonna was hiring said lawyer for her legal brawl with Guy Ritchie.</p> <p>Back in the real world, few could deny that the legitimising of same-sex unions - in terms of rights, pensions and inheritance - was long overdue. All that said, where gay matrimony, and subsequent divorce, is concerned, one can't help wondering why some clever soul didn't seize the opportunity to come up with something more original.</p> <p>What is it with the gay community that their vision of equality so frequently ends up resembling an ersatz version of heterosexuality, even to the point where, in some gay quarters, the response to this - the first high-profile gay divorce - would be one of celebration, of feeling that gay marriage has somehow come of age? It's as if being gay and having the right to get married was all very well, but getting divorced is even better, almost akin to an official blooding.</p> <p>All of which is understandable on some levels (after all they've been through, who could begrudge the gay community their hard-won badges of normality and acceptance?), bizarre and sad on others. The rationale seemingly is: 'You see, it's not all about confetti and costumes and parties with us; we do lawyers and heartbreak, too, just like you straights.'</p> <p>One has to wonder: is this really what the gay community was after during that long fight for equality - legally sanctioned, hetero-flavoured misery? To be, in some ghastly way, 'normalised' by divorce, widely accepted as being one of the most depressing, expensive and humiliating experiences ever, up there with bereavement in terms of cost to pocket and spirit? Faced with such a thought, it isn't long before the cynic inside starts wondering how many emotional, costly gay divorces there will have to be, how many lawyerly trouserings of the fabled pink pound, before the novelty wears off.</p> <p>One also wonders about the wider psychosexual connotations. Heterosexual relations have always seemed comparatively complex (translation: more screwed up). The obvious reason is that we've got more to argue about, especially if we split - marriage (or not), children (or not), ditto exclusivity, finances, all those wonderful 'debates' about commitment. Never mind gay men - these are things a lot of straight men (and quite a few women) would dearly love to dispense with.</p> <p>Indeed, many a straight man must have sighed with secret, and sometimes not so secret, envy at what they fondly imagine to be the gay man's relative autonomy, especially regarding sex and money. And yet, faced with the opportunity to make new, genuinely ground-breaking legislation, what did the gay community do? It settled for 'marriage' and 'divorce', just another version of the mess and pain so many straight people go through. Even odder, the more painful, complicated and expensive things get, the more 'normal' some of them claim to feel.</p> <p>It might amaze some gay people to realise that many straights wouldn't rush to make claims for their way being particularly normal. That we might say: 'Bit iffy this heterosexual system, got any other ideas?'</p> <p>Indeed, with all the stereotyping the gay community has endured over the years, one would have thought they'd have been too clever to fall into the trap of treating the legal side of heterosexuality as if it were some kind of theme park where, locked out for decades, they were finally allowed to try out of some of the rides.</p> <p>As it is, dismayingly, it may turn out that, after the novelty of D.I.V.O.R.C.E. has fizzled out, many in the gay community will kick themselves that they didn't find a more original route to legality and legitimacy, a brand new system that perhaps the straight community may have coveted and emulated. At the very least, to belatedly realise that, sometimes, the more you try to normalise, the weirder and stranger things get.</p> <h2>Sorry, Kerry, but you've got a very serious problem</h2> <p>Kerry Katona's slurred and confused appearance on the ITV's This Morning was a disgrace, the disgrace being that, having gone public with her bipolar disorder years ago, she was automatically disbelieved and derided when she claimed her medication was to blame.</p> <p>As it happens, the drug Katona mentioned (chlorpromazine) does have side-effects such as slurred speech and 'drunk-style' behaviour. Moreover, even if Katona did choose to get blasted before a morning TV show, isn't this what manic depressives do - have manic periods, followed by depressive periods and behave somewhat bizarrely?</p> <p>By far the most sickening aspect of all this has been the faux concern about it being a regrettable new low in celebrity culture.</p> <p>In truth, all most people were doing was laughing at the out-of-it chav. Why? Because they felt entitled. And there perhaps lies the real reason for Katona's downfall.</p> <p>No one sniggered when manic depressive Stephen Fry bolted from a West End play. Or when Elizabeth Wurtzel published Prozac Nation. Or even at Amy Winehouse staggering around onstage.</p> <p>It would seem that there is one rule for manic depressive luvvies, celebrated in the arts, quite another for sufferers such as Katona, with her tawdry boob jobs and Iceland adverts. You got that, Kerry - bipolar, trashed, whatever your state, until you've landed a South Bank Show, you're not deserving of human sympathy.</p> <h2>The strange case of the incredible disappearing President</h2> <p>Whatever Dubya thinks of W, the Oliver Stone biopic starring Josh Brolin, he should be grateful that it's reminded us he still exists. When Al Gore was running for President in 2000, Bill Clinton remained a towering political presence, but Bush is barely remembered: strange, simian-looking chap in Levi's, invaded Iraq - is that him? In this way, Bush is the disappearing man of US politics; they'll have to wrap him in bandages soon to know he's still in the room. Does this confirm something the movie is said to imply about the invasions, the horrors: that Dubya sort of, kinda, didn't mean it? Certainly, some of us remember Bush's eyes popping with alarm when the Twin Towers went down. As in: 'Shit, this wasn't the plan!' While no one is buying into the good ol' boy of Republican legend, the fact remains that Bush started out as a rich kid, with a taste for beer and fun, just the type to relish the idea of a presidency high in power, low in responsibility. The eternal irony of Dubya could be that for all the warmongering, he only ever signed up for a peacetime playboy presidency. Maybe that's why, unlike Gordon Brown, Bush always seemed diminished rather than enhanced by the crises he faced. And why he's now evaporating into political thin air.</p>",
  "<h2>Fifa: World peace</h2> <p>Fifa's next big social responsibility project: Sepp Blatter's Middle East tour, ending in Israel later this month at the inauguration of the Peres Peace House (established by the Peres Center for Peace to help combat prejudice and 'promote cooperation and understanding in Palestinian-Israeli relations'.) Also doing his bit: Fifa senior vice-president and head of Argentina's FA Julio Grondona - forced to apologise in 2003 after telling a live TV audience: 'I do not believe a Jew can ever be a referee in our top division. It's hard work and, you know, Jews don't like hard work.' ('He's a monumental man!' said Sepp after Grondona was cleared of separate fraud allegations. 'We are friends for ever!')</p> <h2>Brave</h2> <p>John Terry says critics who keep questioning his England commitment are 'disappointing'. 'People should know what I'm like as a player and as a character. No one was more gutted than me, as England captain, to walk away from the squad last week injured. England is the ultimate. I don't understand where all this stuff comes from.' \u00b7 <strong>Nov 2007</strong>, News of the World: 'England captain John Terry was so DRUNK during a sleazy lap-dancing party with England team-mates days before their Croatia humiliation that he URINATED on the floor - and in a cup. One witness told us: \"Some of our players don't seem to give a damn about England. Terry was dancing on stage with two lap dancers, wriggling his hips. I thought he was meant to be injured.'\"</p> <h2>Crunch latest</h2> <p>Other England news: JT says the squad feel fans' financial pain. 'Players are in a very lucky position, particularly in these times of the credit crunch. But we're the only country I know of where the international players give all their match fees to charity.

  "<p>A senior member of Sinn Fein in Belfast has been paid tens of thousands of pounds in compensation for an attack planned against him which never happened. </p> <p>Alex Maskey MLA is the Sinn Fein spokesperson for policing and justice and was a key target of loyalist paramilitaries throughout the Troubles. He was once shot and wounded in his home, and a workman who was there was killed.</p> <p> But for a separate attempt to kill him - which failed and which Maskey knew nothing about until years later - he was awarded a five-figure sum, believed to be about \u00a335,000, in criminal injuries compensation earlier this year.</p> <p>The award arises out of an incident in July 1988 involving an army agent and an Ulster Defence Association hitman. The agent inside the UDA had spotted Maskey having Sunday lunch in the Chester Park Hotel in Belfast and tried to organise an assassination bid against him. </p> <p>That involved making contact with UDA units in West Belfast and trying to mobilise them on a Sunday afternoon, when they had never been at their most alert. The agent was Brian Nelson, who was later exposed, convicted of organising murders and has since died. Described by his sister as being 'like a secret squirrel', Nelson appears to have been particularly keen to kill Maskey.</p> <p>The Sinn Fein councillor was then a high-profile city councillor in Belfast. This was at a time when council meetings were often shouting matches across party benches. One Unionist councillor famously tried to spray Maskey with disinfectant to sanitise the chamber.</p> <p>But Maskey was of particular interest to the loyalists and the security forces. The police stalked him closely even then. </p> <p>After seeing Maskey at the hotel, Brian Nelson made two separate attempts to put together a team that would go there to shoot him. This team would have had to include a gunman, a getaway driver and someone to receive the gun and dispose of it. His first effort produced enough men for the operation, but they had no immediate access to weapons.</p> <p>The hitman whom Nelson eventually sent to the hotel was Ken Barrett. He is famous in paramilitary lore as the man who killed Belfast solicitor Pat Finucane a year later. Barrett told BBC journalist John Ware that he had gone to the Chester Park Hotel and had missed Maskey by '20 seconds'. </p> <p>In Ware's investigation for the BBC in 2002, it emerged that Nelson had told his army handlers that he had intended to kill Maskey and that he would try again the following week.</p> <p>But Sinn Fein members and IRA activists were used to staggering their routines to avoid patterns of behaviour that would enable loyalists to predict their movements. And Alex Maskey knew that loyalists would certainly kill him if they got a chance. In that respect, that day was no different from any other.</p> <p>Maskey has said privately that the compensation payment came to him 'out of the blue'. He had forgotten that his solicitor was seeking compensation for the failed attack and he even seemed a little embarrassed by it, conscious that others deserved more help than he did. </p> <p>He put the money towards a move, away from the home in Andersonstown in which he had faced another attack. That attack had killed a workman in the house and led to Maskey surviving gunshots to the stomach.</p> <p>He claimed then that the security forces had been active in setting up that ambush, basing this on the pattern of movement of army vehicles in the area, though he would not have known then about Brian Nelson's efforts to kill him.</p> <p>After that attack, Maskey, like many others in Sinn Fein, had armoured his home. His windows had seven layers of glass in each frame.</p> <p>But the question now is whether all those who have been targeted by paramilitaries over the years - even without knowing it, or suffering no actual attack - are entitled to similar compensation.</p> <p>More recently than the attempt by a British agent to set up Alex Maskey for assassination, agents inside the republican movement have gathered intelligence on prison officers and police personnel. Denis Donaldson, later revealed as an informer and shot dead at a cottage in Donegal, was found to have stolen the names and addresses of hundreds of prison officers and police personnel from the Northern Ireland Office. Many of them were then rehoused for their own safety. </p> <p>Last night the Alliance party leader, David Ford, described the award to Alex Maskey as 'bizarre'.</p> <p>He said: 'It is a bit difficult to believe that somebody in his position was traumatised by something that didn't happen. He must have been aware that he was under threat. </p> <p>'And it is difficult to understand why he was paid so much, when you see the poor levels of compensation paid to the relatives of those killed in the early years of the Troubles.'</p>",
  "<p>Voting for a Republican president runs in the blood of places like Gainesville. The pretty little town of 15,000 sits in north Texas ranch country and it is safe to say that Barack Obama has few fans here. Certainly Jim Farquhar, who works in the justice system, has taken to heart warnings that Obama has links with dangerous radicals, such as former 1960s militant Bill Ayers. </p> <p>'Obama scares me. He has all these friendships. You just don't know how that might effect him once he gets into office,' Farquhar said as he stood outside Gainsville's sturdy old courthouse. 'I'm voting for John McCain.'</p> <p>Such worries are increasingly not shared by many other Americans. Weeks of relentless attacks on Obama by McCain and his running mate Sarah Palin have not succeeded in denting Obama's lead. Instead it has strengthened. Across America, battleground states such as Ohio and Pennsylvania are falling into Obama's column and southern states such as Virginia and North Carolina are going from red to blue. Some Democratic insiders are even whispering about the prospect of a landslide.</p> <p>The flipside of that is a potentially devastating Republican loss. If current polling holds true, the party may be reduced to its core support in the solid red heartland that runs through Texas, Oklahoma, Alabama, Georgia and other southern and western states. That would trigger a profound crisis for a party that just three years ago was basking in the afterglow of a convincing presidential win and dreaming of creating a 'permanent majority'. </p> <p>Now that same Republican party could face a prolonged period in the political wilderness, working out how to appeal to an American public that seems prepared to send a pro-choice, black senator from Chicago to the White House and reject a conservative Republican war hero. </p> <p>'The Republican party is going to have to work out what sort of party it actually wants to be. It's a changing world for them,' said Professor Shaun Bowler, a political scientist at the University of California at Riverside. It might not be easy. A powerful Democratic win could wipe out Republican moderates. It could leave the party in the grip of its conservative and evangelical base who remain critical of figures such as McCain but who are wildly enthusiastic about politicians such as Palin. The Republican party could end up in a bitter civil war for its political future.'</p> <p>One of the key battlegrounds in that conflict will be the role of religion in Republican politics. The evangelical base has been a key part of the political coalition that has brought the party such success in recent years. Political guru Karl Rove cemented evangelical ideas into President George W Bush's brand of conservatism and used them to inspire a very effective 'get out the vote' team in elections.</p> <p>Rove focused on social issues such as gay marriage and abortion as a way of ensuring fanatical evangelical support. Nothing came to symbolise the power of the evangelical movement more than the rise of mega-churches, especially in staunchly Republican areas. These enormous edifices now dot the landscape of many states and Texas is no exception.</p> <p>In the northern Dallas suburb of Prosper, a new mega-church has just opened. It is called Prestonwood North and is a branch of its mother church a few miles south in Plano, a fast-growing city of some 260,000 people. At first glance the church looks like a sparkling new office development, identical to many other buildings popping up on farmland as these 'exurbs' of Dallas succumb to development. But the large cross on its front reveals the truth. Taken as a whole, Prestonwood now has almost 30,000 members, making it one of the largest churches in America. It was recently named as one of America's 50 most influential churches.</p> <p>It certainly fits in in Prosper. Once a hamlet, it is gradually being swallowed by the suburbs, but its politics remain God and guns. 'People around here all voted for Bush. That has not really changed. It's a churchgoing kind of place,' said Michelle Williams, 32, a dental nurse.</p> <p>In Texas, church and politics have been mixing. In recent weeks, leading evangelical leaders in the state have endorsed McCain from their pulpits. They include Pastor Gary Simons, who heads a church near Dallas. He compared Obama to King Herod, the biblical child killer, because of his support for abortion. 'How many of you would want to go to the polls and vote for Herod?' Simons asked his congregation. </p> <p>But increasingly such nakedly political preaching is looking out of step with many religious voters. Obama, who is a regular churchgoer and looks at ease in religious surroundings, has made huge strides in appealing to evangelical voters. His campaign has aggressively courted the religious vote, holding regular meetings with evangelical leaders.</p> <p>That is in marked contrast to the 2004 Democratic nominee, John Kerry. It has worked too. A recent survey showed Obama and McCain in a virtual dead heat among born-again Christians, with support for McCain running at 45 per cent and Obama on 43 per cent. In 2004, Bush won 62 per cent of that vote. 'If Obama goes on to win, one of the significant stories will be the profile of the faith vote ... the Democrats are poised to make up significant ground among born again and evangelical voters,' said David Kinnaman, president of the evangelical research group that carried out the poll.</p> <p>The trend is also likely to reflect growing differences in the evangelical movement itself; changes that are leaving the Republican party behind. Far from being a monolithic bloc, evangelicals have increasingly embraced a wider variety of causes. Some are just as likely to campaign on fighting Aids and issues in the developing world as to crusade against abortion and gay marriage. One of the hottest topics in conservative Christianity at the moment is environmental conservation and global warming, neither of which is a Republican strong suit.</p> <p>Yet, following a possible November defeat, the Republican party itself could still remain firmly in the hands of its conservative evangelical wing. Even as America drifts away from causes that right-wing evangelicals care about, the Republican base remains fixated on them. After all, McCain was forced to court the evangelical vote in order to secure the nomination himself. </p> <p>To cement his position, he ended up choosing Palin - a true religious conservative - as his running mate. That move electrified die-hard Republicans but turned off other voters for whom the collapsing economy - not fighting the teaching of evolution in schools or banning abortion - has become the overriding concern. It allowed Obama to seize the vital middle ground. </p> <p>'In the Republican party itself it seems that the Christian right is going to be in the ascendancy. But that is looking like a losing political strategy for the future,' said Bowler.</p> <p>There is increasingly a sense that what works for the Republican base no longer works for the rest of the country, even in the heart of red state America. Take Kingfisher, Oklahoma. The town sits in the middle of a county that is one of the reddest in America when it comes to presidential politics. It voted for Bush over Kerry in 2004 by a staggering 85 per cent to 15 per cent. Even now the state of Oklahoma remains spectacularly loyal to the Republicans. The most recent poll showed McCain 24 points ahead of Obama. A previous one gave him a lead of more than 30 per cent.</p> <p>But even in Kingfisher the signs of Republican disarray are not hard to find. Businesswoman Charlene Franks is put off by the campaign that McCain and Palin are running. 'I am voting for McCain but I don't really like it. It's the economy that matters right now and groceries are getting expensive. We really don't eat that much any more,' she said. Her views on Palin were not complimentary either. 'She is not ready to be president,' Franks said.</p> <p>Ready or not, Palin is still likely to be one of the most dominant forces in Republican politics after the election. Unlike McCain, she draws thousands to her rallies. She has developed a genuinely enthusiastic following among activists who are dedicated to her cause. Already there is speculation that Palin, if McCain loses in November, will be the hottest pick for the nomination in 2012. </p> <p>That will be made easier by a large-scale electoral defeat. In a process reminiscent of the Labour party in the 1980s and the Conservatives in the late 1990s, the Republicans could end up as an extremist rump, reduced to a few stronghold states and obsessed with causes that seem not to matter to the general public. </p> <p>Across America, moderate Republicans are facing a tough battle as the Democrats look set to increase greatly their strength in Congress. Some analysts are seeing Democratic gains of up to nine Senate seats and 30 seats in the House of Representatives. In a leaked Republican party document last week, an incredible 58 House seats were ranked as potentially at risk with 11 of them virtually written off as already lost. </p> <p>If the Democrats perform strongly enough to control 60 Senate seats then they would have a virtual free rein over the political landscape. Republicans would probably survive only in their heartland, thus thrusting the party further right at a time when the country has shifted left. That would mark a profound change similar to Ronald Reagan's win in 1980 which seemed to usher in a conservative-dominated era. </p> <p>The possibility has many Republican pundits terrified. 'The end of the Reagan era?' blared one headline in the political magazine National Journal. The Wall Street Journal added fuel to the fire with an editorial that went ever further. 'Get ready for change we haven't seen since 1965 or 1933,' it warned under the headline: 'A liberal supermajority'.</p> <p>Such a prospect angers conservative Republicans. But much of that anger is directed at the current occupant of the White House. For eight years Bush preached conservatism from the Oval Office. He spoke of a desire for small government, limited spending and an emphasis on social issues such as fighting abortion. Instead the size of government has increased - mostly due to the creation of the Department of Homeland Security - and spending has rocketed because of Iraq and Afghanistan. </p> <p>On social issues, Bush has delivered a more conservative Supreme Court but abortion remains legal. In a final blow to conservative ideals, the economic crisis has seen Bush's administration preside over the semi-nationalisation of swaths of the financial services industry.</p> <p>No wonder there is anger on the streets of places like Gainesville. After all, the Texas town backed Bush in 2004 with 79 per cent of the vote. Now its people feel they did not get what they voted for. 'There's been no leadership. I liked Bush as a man. He was not very polished, but that was part of his appeal. But things have not turned out well,' said Bill Wilkinson, a writer, as he walked past a cafe on Gainesville's town square. </p> <p>Of course, it is still premature to declare an Obama victory. 'Anything can happen. But the election is clearly Obama's to lose,' said Kinnaman.</p> <p>McCain has built a long political career on unlikely comebacks. He might yet pull off the biggest surprise of his life. But for the moment the signs are grim across the Republican heartland. </p> <p>From Kingfisher, Oklahoma, to Gainesville, Texas, and far beyond the mood is sour. 'I guess it looks like Obama is going to make it,' said Farquhar. 'But no one is happy about it. It is going to be beyond just having another tax-and-spend liberal in office.' </p> <p>That will be for the future to decide. But for the moment it looks as if Obama and the Democrats are preparing for the highest office in America, to add to their control of both House and Senate. The Republicans, meanwhile, are bracing for what could be a painful period of exile.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on Wednesday October 29 2008.

  "<p>Since its first performance, Sophocles's drama has come to typify the struggle of the individual testing the limits of the state. Most contemporary productions present Antigone as the tragic challenger (a proto-feminist, even, although originally played by a male actor on the Athens stage), insisting on the primacy of 'natural justice' (in Don Taylor's translation) over man-made law and braving the death penalty to perform burial rites for her brother against the decree of her uncle, Creon.</p> <p>Greg Hersov's production suggests another view. Here, it is Creon who is testing the limits of state authority; it is Ian Redford, a soft-soaping Tricky Dicky Nixon-like head of state, in his loose brown suit, who has overstepped the bounds of what is possible in a democracy by laying down and enforcing an impious law. He it is who pays the price: he ends the play a howling ruin, grovelling in the cracks of Laurie Dennett's dried earth set, next to the pyre on which lie the bodies of the wife and son he has driven to suicide.</p> <p>Matti Houghton's shrill, hysterical Antigone is collateral damage in Creon's hubristic refusal to recognise that, as the Chorus concludes: '...to hold the gods in awe./ This is the law...'</p>",
  "<p>One of the most intense football rivalries takes place in pixelated form. In the home dressing room sits the FIFA series, produced by American developer EA (Electronic Arts). In the away dressing room you'll find the underdog, Winning Eleven, better known in Europe as Pro Evolution Soccer, or PES. Both games are hugely popular and both attract fiercely loyal fans. It's rare to meet a gamer who plays both games - playing both FIFA and PES would be like supporting Manchester United and Liverpool.</p> <p>The rivalry is defined by one familiar parameter: style versus substance. As its name suggests, FIFA has an official licence. It features real team names, players who look like their real-world counterparts, replica kits, real tournaments and real stadiums. </p> <p>The latest version was released last month, and FIFA 09 features the now-expected excellent graphics, handsome in-game menus, slick commentary and an overall level of polish that sets the benchmark for all sports video games. (It also had a cracking advert, featuring Wayne Rooney in a live link-up game with Real Madrid's Gonzalo Higua\u00edn.) But, crucially, FIFA loses big points for its gameplay, which is fun but unrealistic - for example, it's far too easy to score wonder goals from distance. EA has made an effort to make FIFA play less like an arcade kickabout, but it can't match Pro Evo for sheer playability.</p> <p>Pro Evolution Soccer was developed in Japan by Konami, under the guidance of Shingo Takatsuka, who goes by the nickname 'Seabass' (he loves fishing). Seabass is a perfectionist whose attention to detail is reflected in PES's award-winning playability. Pro Evo has always played like a dream, so much so that its fans overlook the lack of sophistication and official licences - who cares if you're playing at 'Trad Brick Stadium', rather than Old Trafford? </p> <p>In Pro Evo, it's common for a game to end 0-0. These stalemates can be more rewarding than a 6-5 goal-fest, simply because the gameplay resembles the real thing. The latest version, PES 2009, also came out last month - just two weeks after FIFA 09, continuing the battle between the franchises. The only way to decide which side of the fence you are on in this particular franchise battle is to pick up a control pad...</p>",

  "<p>It might not feel like it now, but there is life after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/redundancy\">redundancy</a>. Jim Fisher, a 48-year-old from Tipton, West Midlands, lost his job six weeks ago at the Firth Cleveland steel works after 31 years of service. 'I was down for a couple of weeks,' admits the father of two, who was let go along with more than 50 of his colleagues. 'But it's also an exciting time for me. If I don't do make a go of things now, I'll never get another opportunity.' </p> <p>Fisher was aware that his company was having problems more than 12 months ago and, with the help from his union, began retraining and has since requalified in various skills including bricklaying, plastering and even driving a JCB, all of which have helped him set up his own business. He received an \u00a318,000 redundancy payout from the employer he had been with since he was 17 years old. 'We could see the writing on the wall,' he says. 'I purchased everything I needed for my new business before I lost my job. I bought my own van and every week I'd buy a new tool.'</p> <p>As David Kuo, financial expert at the money website <a href=\"http://www.Fool.co.uk\">Fool.co.uk</a>, puts it: when the axe falls, it is 'the job that's being made redundant, not you'. </p> <p>'People mustn't feel bad about redundancy,' he says. 'The company has decided that the job is no longer required and the fact that you once filled that job means that you no longer fit into company strategy.' </p> <p>He continues: 'A lot of people find, when they are made redundant from very high-powered job, that their work-life balance has been thrown out of kilter. They work more than they spend time with their families. What redundancy does is jolt you back into reality again.'</p> <p>The economic crisis means that the number of jobless could hit the two million mark by Christmas. The number of people being made unemployed is rising faster than at any time since the recession of the early 1990s. But while redundancy is brutal and can be devastating, it is, Kuo says, also 'a good time to revaluate your life'.</p> <p>'Redundancy can be the chance to go off and do something you really want to do. A lot of the jobs people go on to are more creative,' says Donna Bradshaw, financial planning strategist with the IFG Group. She left her job in the mid-1990s, took severance pay ('about eight or nine months' pay plus bonuses') and went travelling for a year. </p> <p>It is a view that Jim Fisher subscribes to. It isn't the prospect of plastering other people's walls that's firing his imagination ('I'm keeping myself busy but construction work is on its knees,' he says); it is the opportunity to become an entrepreneur. </p> <p>This isn't just some Dragons' Den-style dream: Fisher has designed and is manufacturing a new type of builder's trowel, which he has spent \u00a310,000 developing. It has attracted interest from the UK's leading tool manufacturer, but Jim has opted to go into business with a smaller local company. So far they have sold several hundred through builders' merchants. 'If it's a success, it could make us wealthy but I also hope it will create new jobs in the West Midlands,' he says.</p> <p>Richard Bayle of Siddalls, an independent financial adviser that specialises in helping people moving abroad, is also positive about the experience of losing his job. 'Redundancy was possibly one of the best things that happened to me,' he says. </p> <p>When Bayle was 52 years old, in 1999, he was one of thousands at the Prudential to be made redundant. 'I was very, very angry at first,' he recalls. 'But then I thought I could either sit there ringing my hands or get off my arse.' </p> <p>He and his wife upped sticks and moved to France. 'I couldn't speak French, I was in late middle age and suffering from shell-shock after losing a well-paid job,' he says. </p> <p>Assisted by a redundancy package worth around \u00a380,000 after tax, Bayle set up home south of Toulouse and began a new career as an insurance broker. Since the credit crunch first hit, he has noted a sharp increase in the number of people taking redundancy and settling abroad. According to Bayle, the would-be expats are in pursuit of a greater quality of life but they also want to escape the rising cost of living in the UK. </p> <p>'My community charge [the equivalent of council tax] in France, including everything, amounts to less than \u00a3500 whereas in Portsmouth it's \u00a31,700,' he says. 'Cost of living has to be about 30 per cent cheaper in France. When you are on a pension - or you've taken early retirement due to redundancy - that's a huge difference.'</p> <p>Aj Somal is a chartered financial planner with Positive Solutions and advises employees on-site in workplaces where redundancies are taking place. He reports that, increasingly, people are seeking voluntary redundancy, with one scheme 'at least twice oversubscribed'. </p> <p>'The workers felt that voluntary redundancy might not be offered again and they might miss out completely and just get statutory redundancy,' he says.</p> <p>As outlined in Cash's guide to redundancy last week, workers are often shocked at how little statutory redundancy pay is: one week's pay for each year's service between the ages of 22 and 41, and 1.5 weeks thereafter, subject to caps. So someone who is 40 with four years' service will get a maximum of \u00a31,320. The first \u00a330,000 of a payout is tax-free, although it might affect your ability to claim benefits. </p> <p>Kuo also advises people to see redundancy as an opportunity to reassess their finances. 'Have you been leading your life according to how much you have been earning in your job? People often feel as though they are on a treadmill and the faster they go the more they spend,' he says. 'When it suddenly comes to an abrupt end, it is a good time to look at what your income and what your expenditure is.'</p> <p>Bradshaw agrees: 'It's important to keep some money aside if you are going to do something completely different or use the money to set up a business. Budget wisely and have a contingency plan.'</p> <p>\u2022 For information about your rights on redundancy, contact Citizens Advice (also see their online guide at <a href=\"http://www.adviceguide.org.uk\">adviceguide.org.uk</a>), law centre or trade union.</p>",

In an ominous sign for the government, their rage is directed not at the Pakistani Taliban, who took over their area, but the army, whose onslaught with jets and helicopters forced them to abandon their homes and livelihoods.</p> <p>Packed together in tented cities, these deeply conservative Islamic refugees have had to drop the strict purdah that the women observed at home.

Already there are outbreaks of disease, with acute diarrhoea and respiratory illnesses being treated by medical aid workers. There are 30,000 people living in official camps and there are contingencies being prepared by the United Nations to accommodate 100,000, as people continue to flood out of Bajaur. Soon Bajaur will be virtually empty. The UN believes that a further 200,000 will be put up in houses by 'host families', often relatives.</p> <p>The Pakistani government has had to scramble to set up camps for these 'internally displaced people' as a result of the military assault in Bajaur, now into its third month. Aid agencies and the UN have rushed to provide support. At first it was thought the army would finish the job within a month, but with no signs of the operation ending these camps are being given more permanent facilities.</p> <p>There are fears that the sites could be infiltrated by Taliban militants, whose wives and children are already living there. When one Western aid worker asked a group of women at prayer who they were praying for, back came the reply: 'Our men fighting the army.'</p> <p>Pakistan's security forces are engaged in a fitful war with Taliban and al-Qaeda extremists who largely control the country's tribal border with Afghanistan.</p> <p>The Bajaur operation appears to be Pakistan's most determined attack on its home-grown extremists since 9/11. So far there is little action in other parts of the tribal belt. Should Pakistan finally decide that war is the only way to deal with the extremists, the fate of the people of Bajaur could be replicated across the tribal area, home to around three million people. </p> <p>The armed forces attack indiscriminately, according to Mohammad Ibrahim, 15. 'Our village is completely vacant now. There was constant shelling, so we ran. They drop bombs on mosques, on schools, they don't look. We're the ones dying, but they say that terrorists have been killed.'</p> <p>Pakistan's battle against Islamic extremists coincides with two other crises: political turmoil and economic collapse. They are pushing the country towards becoming a failed state, which nevertheless possesses nuclear arms.</p> <p>Bajaur is a strategically important position for the militants - a conduit to the rest of the tribal area and Afghanistan - which they are fighting hard to defend. The army claims to have killed more than 1,000 militants in the operation, a statistic that few believe. It has not released the number of civilians killed or wounded.</p> <p>'Houses are being used by the militants as bunkers. They're firing from there. Therefore all houses from where the firing is coming are being engaged by the security forces,' said the chief army spokesman, Major-General Athar Abbas. 'To our knowledge, the civilians of this area have left.'</p> <p>Bajaur shows how intimately linked the campaigns in Pakistan and Afghanistan are. The Pakistani Taliban are defending the region with help from Afghan Taliban, Arabs, Chechens and other foreigners from al-Qaeda. The movement in Bajaur is being directed by Qari Ziaur Rahman, an Afghan Taliban commander, who is also overseeing the insurgency in the neighbouring Afghan provinces of Kunar and Nooristan.</p> <p>'The mujahideen have completely gained control on the ground [in Bajaur]. The American agenda to destroy the mujahideen and all the [Pakistan] government options have failed to defeat us,' Rahman said in an interview with a local journalist.</p> <p>On the outskirts of the provincial capital, Peshawar, an old refugee camp for Afghans, who were forced out of it only a year ago, has had to take on a grim new existence, this time for Pakistan's own people. There are already about 5,500 Bajaur refugees at the Kacha Garhi camp, a wide, flat, wind-blown expanse, and there are plans to expand it to accommodate 21,000. Even here, in a city, there is little food and water and no electricity or gas, so people gather brushwood and branches to cook. </p> <p>Mohammad Jan, standing outside his family's tent at Kacha Garhi, ran from Bajaur when nine people from his village were killed by the army. 'There were no Taliban in our area,' Jan insisted. 'It is ordinary people who are dying. This is some kind of game, a double game that I don't understand.'</p> <p>One newly arrived elderly woman died of dehydration in the long, chaotic queue to register with the authorities at Kacha Garhi, causing a mini-riot. Mohammad Zahra said he had 20 mouths to feed, his children and those of three brothers.

  "<p>When, in 2005, Lady Victoria de Rothschild agreed to make a \u00a31m loan to the Tories through her newly established company, Ironmade Ltd, the political world was a different place. </p> <p>The cash for honours row that was to result in calls for a dramatic change in the way parties are funded had yet to explode. Stock markets boomed and Britain bathed in prosperity. Hedge fund managers, oligarchs and venture capitalists flourished in what we now know to be the final years of the long boom. Many used their fortunes for philanthropic purposes, or to buy up some of Britain's finest real estate or even football clubs. Others ploughed their cash into the Conservative party. </p> <p>Much of the financial assistance dates back to before 2006 when the Electoral Administration Act came into force and brought to an end the use of anonymous loans. In fact, in the weeks before the De Rothschild loan was made, a number of front-page stories appeared, alleging that political parties had circumvented existing funding legislation by asking donors to give them 'soft' loans - loans which, it was assumed, would be later converted into donations. The way for would-be donors to stay anonymous was to 'give' a loan. </p> <p>Lady Victoria, now 59, was born Victoria Schott, the daughter of a Florida property developer. She married Evelyn de Rothschild in 1973. Her husband rose to become a leading light of the banking empire and she became independently wealthy upon their divorce in 2000, owning numerous properties in London and the United States. Friends say she uses her dual nationality to flit between London and New York. </p> <p>She became close to the Tories after the divorce and gave \u00a3129,500 to the party between 2002 and January 2005. In the US she has donated to both the George Bush and Barack Obama campaigns. </p> <p>However, senior Tories said she moved into the top tier of funders under the leadership of Michael Howard when she was given the title of vice-treasurer. 'She was seen as a party stalwart. She had real political talent,' one said. </p> <p>According to those close to the party, De Rothschild's loan was made after seeking the approval of several Tory grandees. She was advised by a number of senior figures in the party, including Lord Marland, then treasurer, that if she wished to stay anonymous, she could </p> <p>set up a company with other people as director and secretary. This would be, she was told, within the law, and would mean that she would not have to face further scrutiny from journalists and others. </p> <p>At the time the Conservatives were facing a multi-million-pound deficit following an unsuccessful general election campaign. She asked a solicitor and her secretary to become director and secretary of the company in April 2005. Weeks later, she gave just over \u00a31m to the company, which was transferred to the party. </p> <p>Since Howard stood down in the wake of the 2005 election defeat, De Rothschild has not been as prominent in the party - some say that the loan was her last major political act. She briefly surfaced as a public figure again in 2006 during the cash for honours affair, after police sought to interview lenders to major political parties to see if they had bought honours. The interview was short, insiders said. 'She told police that she had no reason to buy a title because she already had one,' said a friend.</p> <p>De Rothschild is far from the only person to have made substantial loans to the Tories through an obscure company. Big Ben Films Ltd lent the Tories \u00a32.6m in 2006, after the new laws on funding were introduced. In the same year the company, which says its principal business is 'to offer general business services', made an after-tax profit of \u00a31,293. </p> <p>Big Ben Films' immediate parent company is Boldergate Ltd, registered in the British Virgin Islands. Boldergate in turn gives its ultimate parent company as Business Management Services Nominees Ltd, registered in another tax haven, the Antilles. The company's sole director is Johan Eliasch, a Swedish-born businessman who lives in London. He is reputed to be worth \u00a3355m and openly supports the Tories. </p> <p>Michael Hintze, formerly a star trader at the investment bank Goldman Sachs, lent the Tories \u00a32.5m in May 2005 through a Jersey-based trust called Morain Investments. A Liechtenstein trust, the Medlina Foundation, lent the Tories \u00a3950,000 in 2004 via the bequest of a deceased supporter of the party.</p> <p>Last week it emerged that the party recently turned down an impermissible donation for \u00a36,600 from an American banker, Robin Saunders, before accepting an identical sum from her British-based company six days later. The Electoral Commission is now investigating.</p> <p>A donation of \u00a350,000 was given in June this year by Sleepwell Hotels UK, which is owned by a trust in the Isle of Man. Latest accounts from 2006 show that it has not traded. Denham Eke, managing director of the trust, said the business was now trading and this would be reflected in future accounts.</p> <p>There is no suggestion the lenders, donors or the Tory party have broken any laws. But critics have urged the party to be more transparent with its finances. 'The Conservatives should stop ducking and diving to stay an inch inside the law,' said Lord Oakeshott, the Liberal Democrats' Treasury spokesman.</p>",

  "<p>The noises people make with the lights out are the source of a million jokes: animal sounds ('Woof, woof'), mistaken identities ('Oh my dearest Marianne! I mean, Patricia!'), embarrassing arthritis ('Creak'). It's a wonder, in fact, that we ever dare open our mouths at all. But we do, and here's why. Recently a survey was carried out of students across America, which found the majority of people interpreted any noise at all - moans, groans, odd words or full sentences - as encouragement. Silence is disconcerting. It also gets in the way of communication, which any agony aunt will tell you is vital to the health of your relationship.</p> <p>Despite great interest in what other people utter during moments of passion, as evidenced by an enormous number of internet sites offering advice on what not to say during sex ('Can you please pass me the remote control?' or 'When would you like to meet my parents?'), there has been, for obvious reasons, little research into the reasons we talk during sex and what we say.</p> <p>So it's a true but disappointing fact that there is no evidence that a British gent is more likely to say 'Geronimo' during intercourse than a Norwegian, however much we might suspect that to be the case.</p> <p>However, a couple of years ago, a behavioural scientist called Dr Roy J Levin published a discursive paper on the subject in a most learned journal entitled Sexual and Relationship Therapy. He puts forward four possible reasons for the sounds humans make during sex: conveying information, increasing arousal, enhancing pleasure, and facilitating central arousal systems. To laymen, three of these may sound remarkably similar to one another but Levin differentiates. Information is fairly obvious - 'don't stop', 'higher', 'please don't pull my hair' and so on.</p> <p>Increasing Sexual Arousal is more subtle: men find hearing sounds the third most arousing sense, after sight and touch; women rank it second last in importance. Enhancing Pleasure is, in scientific terms, 'hedonic amplification', which has to do with the way an intake of breath affects the body - hyperventilation leads to giddiness: 'Baby, I'm losing my mind.' This, just so you know, was also the conclusion of an earlier report, which has been preserved in academic archives but is sadly not available any more, which rejoices in the title of 'The Function of Groaning'. </p> <p>The fundamental distinction between the types of noise made during sex (with the exception of a fairly firm 'no' as opposed to anything else) is whether they are linguistic or non-linguistic. That is to say, whether it's 'Yes, yes, yes' or, simply, 'Grr'. </p> <p>Linguistic communication is most often used for the purpose of conveying information, which can range from a specific instruction ('Please could you move your hand to the right and stop digging your elbow into my ribs') to more subtle encouragement ('Don't stop, that's nice'). This is what makes us human and able, for example, to learn a few useful bons mots in a foreign language and wheel them out in the throes of passion (is not French the language of love?). Whereas non-linguistic communication is what we have in common with other beasts - for example, with the Barbary macaque, a monkey that was the subject of a study at the end of last year. </p> <p>Mr Barbary finds it extremely difficult to have an orgasm without vocal encouragement from Mrs Barbary. Scientists discovered this by counting the male monkeys' pelvic thrusts as they were subjected to a variety of sounds - a task which was 'quite weird', according to researcher Dana Pfefferle, a behavioural scientist and primatologist who worked on the project at the German Primate Centre. It revealed that when there was more noise, there were more thrusts. Nobody has counted Mr Human's pelvic thrusts, although the internet does throw up a number of worried inquiries from chaps who want to know why their lady friends aren't making much noise. Disconcerting maybe, but not necessarily a bad thing.</p> <p>After all, it's probably better to say nothing at all than to say the wrong thing ('Mummy!'), or - science aside - run the risk of spoiling the moment.</p>",
  "<p>League titles are rarely won without overcoming the kind of difficulties Hibernian presented to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/celtic\">Celtic</a> in a relentlessly engrossing match. The champions' victory was in serious doubt until late goals from Glenn Loovens and Scott Brown spoiled the visitors' comeback - through Colin Nish and Steven Fletcher - having been two down to goals from Stephen McManus and Cillian Sheridan. </p> <p>Those opening goals only temporarily dispelled the growing anxieties among a home support that had seen Artur Boruc, in the Celtic goal, troubled by accurate shooting long before their own heroes offered a genuine threat. Indeed, there was enough evidence to suggest Gordon Strachan's side had been rendered unusually vulnerable by their European exertions in midweek.</p> <p>Celtic's extraordinary record in domestic matches immediately after Champions League assignments - only one defeat in 32 - hinted strongly at remarkable powers of recovery, but the circumstances in which they entered this game were appreciably less favourable than for many of those that had gone before. </p> <p>Not only did they have to overcome the psychological bruising left by Manchester United at Old Trafford on Tuesday, but also the continued absence of their two most physical strikers, Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink and Georgios Samaras.</p> <p>Strachan tried to compensate by including the tall and powerful teenager Sheridan in attack, beside the diminutive Scott McDonald, and the young Irishman's goal - doubling Celtic's advantage so soon after the opener - was a glittering reward that lost some of its lustre when Nish and Fletcher erased the deficit.</p> <p>But the manner in which Sheridan converted his opportunity - side-stepping goalkeeper Yves Ma-Kalambay on the left side of the area before rolling the ball into the unprotected net - hinted at a composure that will be invaluable in the development of his career.</p> <p>McManus's strike had come, rather fortunately, from Shunsuke Nakamura's corner on the right. The Japan midfielder seemed to miscue the ball low into the area, but it evaded all attempts at interception before arriving at McManus and the big defender hooked it over the line from seven yards. </p> <p>Nish's goal was the least Hibs deserved from a first half in which they matched the home team. Steven Fletcher came in from the right and hit a powerful drive that was deflected, by Nish, beyond Boruc and into the far corner.</p> <p>Few, however, would have anticipated the equaliser so early in the second half, which Celtic started with Loovens in place of McManus. The Dutchman and his fellow defenders were skinned by Ian Murray's perfect pass to Nish, on the right, and his perfect cross to Fletcher, who drove the ball into an unprotected net from eight yards. </p> <p>The predictable resurgence by Celtic was strengthened by the arrival of Aiden McGeady, in place of the largely ineffective Nakamura, but the first noteworthy incident was provided by referee Calum Murray, who appeared to be very generous to the visitors when he refused the home team's claim for a penalty after Lewis Stevenson appeared to take the feet from under Shaun Maloney. </p> <p>But Loovens eventually restored the lead, rising to a cross from Maloney, on the left, and heading the ball low to the left of Ma-Kalambay. Brown confirmed the victory after a well executed one-two with McDonald and a low, left-foot drive to the right of Ma-Kalambay from the edge of the penalty area.</p>",
  "<p>Gerard Houllier used to moan about the long list of former <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool\">Liverpool</a> players turned pundits constantly harping on about the good old days when the club would always win titles. Rafa Ben\u00edtez has not managed to end the long wait either, though at least he has most of the media pack singing from the same hymn sheet. </p> <p>'Every year we are improving,' is the standard Ben\u00edtez answer to almost any question involving the word 'when', and this is indisputably so. Liverpool have improved this season to the extent that even Manchester United have finally been beaten in the league, leading their supporters to hope that this afternoon might bring the ultimate statement of intent: an end to Chelsea's four-year unbeaten home record and a lead opening up at the top of the Premier League table. </p> <p>The only snag, apart from the fact that Liverpool must go to Stamford Bridge without the talismanic Fernando Torres, is that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea\">Chelsea</a> have been improving, too. Luiz Felipe Scolari has adapted to the Premier League as effortlessly as Jos\u00e9 Mourinho did in his first season, has added Deco to an already skilful midfield and is winning praise for playing attacking, flowing football. Even Ben\u00edtez is impressed, though one has the sense he would warm to anyone more than Mourinho, with whom relations were always prickly. 'I think Chelsea have a more offensive mentality now,' the Liverpool manager explains, by which he means more attacking. 'Playing the way they do Chelsea might concede a few more goals than they used to, but they will create more chances for themselves and control games in that way. I have every respect for Scolari. When we talk after a game, we can talk about football.' </p> <p>Confidence is reasonably high within Liverpool circles, with the result against United and the fighting spirit shown in several late comebacks this season, yet until Chelsea show any hint of weakness the safest place to be is on the fence. 'A point would be a good result at Chelsea,' Mark Lawrenson reckons. 'Liverpool would then have four from six in the top-four mini-league and that could be all they need. The top teams don't drop many points.' </p> <p>John Aldridge believes Liverpool should not be too disheartened by the loss of Torres, because the striker did not play when United were beaten, and Steven Gerrard was only a substitute that day. 'The other lads rose to the challenge and got a vital three points,' suggests the former striker, who left the club early in their last title-winning season, 1989-90. 'Liverpool must ensure they don't waste their great start to the season.' </p> <p>Phil Thompson is not underestimating the difficulty of today's task. 'Chelsea had a bullishness under Mourinho, but now they have an air of confidence I've never seen from them before,' he argues. Finally Tommy Smith, bless him, is worried about the number of goals Liverpool are conceding. 'The two full-backs [Andrea Dossena and Alvaro Arbeloa] don't defend very well and look vulnerable,' he says in typically forthright fashion. 'Attacking full-backs can be a positive, but when moves break down and they can't get back it is a negative.'</p> <p>The truth these ex-pros are tiptoeing around is that even this early in the season, today's game is an old-fashioned top-of-the-table six-pointer, and it has been a while since Liverpool were in such a position. Strictly speaking it is not the points that are important - there are still enough games left for either side to recover from a poor result - but the outcome. Liverpool know they have to do better against their immediate rivals in the top four. Ben\u00edtez has said as much. Now he has a first league win against United under his belt, a positive result at Chelsea would boost Liverpool immeasurably and make title rivals take note. Yet by the same token defeat would suggest to everyone, even the players, that little has changed. There is a lot riding on the result, even if it is only October. </p> <p>So never mind the pundits, what do the fans think? The Red and White Kop website offers some authentic Scouse candour, even if opinions differ on the subject of the recently reacquired habit of winning through late goals. 'There's been no credit given to the team whatsoever this season and I think it stinks,' one poster wrote. 'Manchester United have been scoring late and winning games in the last 15 minutes for bloody years!' Another contributor was less sanguine and more succinct. 'Too much drama and not enough murdering,' he wrote of the huffing and puffing that went on against Wigan and Manchester City. 'Liverpool have set off at a fair pace, but Chelsea look head and shoulders above everyone else. After eight games their goal difference is double Liverpool's.'</p> <p>Ben\u00edtez knows what needs to be done. 'We need to stop conceding early goals,' he says. 'I am pleased with the way we have come back to win matches but I would prefer it if we didn't go behind in the first place. Scoring first against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in midweek was almost a new experience for us, and that's what we have to try and do more often.' </p> <p>Ideally, Liverpool would then go on to put the game to bed with a second goal, as looked likely in Madrid, or put up the shutters as of old and protect a slender margin of victory. What happened on Wednesday summed up the Liverpool season so far, or at least put the usual pattern into reverse. From a comfortable position, with Thompson telling Sky Sports viewers only one team had bothered to turn up midway through the first half, Liverpool ended with their best attacking players on the sidelines watching Atl\u00e9tico almost steal victory at the death.</p> <p>It was not a calamitous result, but as a demonstration of how to control a game it was rubbish. Chelsea would not have been impressed, nor would any of the Liverpool sides from 20 years ago, who often seemed to control whole seasons. But that was before Manchester United got their act together under Sir Alex Ferguson and Chelsea became a byword for wealth and efficiency. Ben\u00edtez, in his fifth season at Anfield, is having more trouble shifting those two than he experienced with Real Madrid and Barcelona in Spain. He stayed at Valencia for three years and delivered two titles. 'The first year was good, the third was fantastic,' he claims. He says Liverpool are approaching that level now, but then he would, wouldn't he? Today could go a long way to establishing whether Liverpool's title hopes are real, or merely fantastic.</p>",
  "<p>Scented candles, a birthing pool, favourite music, primitive screams or injections of drugs: each of the 700,000 women a year who deliver a child in the UK has her own way of getting through the inescapable pain.</p> <p>One in four end up giving birth by caesarean section, where the baby is born after surgeons cut into a woman's abdomen and uterus. Some choose in advance that they will have the operation while others - such as actress Billie Piper last week - are given it in an emergency.</p> <p>There are people who regard how a woman gives birth as a barometer of her womanliness. Some view elective caesareans as a sellout, as evidence that mothers-to-be, afraid of natural childbirth, have taken the easy option. The decision of celebrities such as Victoria Beckham and Christina Aguilera to give birth this way has led to claims that some women are 'too posh to push'.</p> <p>Now one of Britain's leading midwives has reignited the debate about caesareans. In an interview with The Observer, Louise Silverton, deputy general-secretary of the Royal College of Midwives, has controversially claimed that an increasing number of women under 40 are less prepared to undergo the physical trauma of childbirth than their predecessors, a trend that is pushing up the rate of surgical deliveries. </p> <p>She argued that 25 per cent of births being caesareans is an 'unacceptably high and needlessly high' figure and that those 170,000 deliveries involve dangers for both the mothers and their babies. In 1980 it was just 9 per cent. While any woman can request the procedure, NHS guidelines say there should be good clinical or psychological reasons.</p> <p>Silverton believes caesareans have become too easy to obtain, especially the 66,500 procedures - 9.5 per cent - that are planned in advance. 'Society's tolerance of pain and illness has reduced significantly,' she said. 'Women are less tolerant of labour pains because they haven't developed tolerance of pain. For example, if they get period pain they will either take Nurofen or go to their GP.</p> <p>'Women are trying to remove the symptoms of pregnancy as much as they can. They are seeking to control everything. Choosing to have a caesarean gives you an element of control.'</p> <p>But she added: 'A caesarean is major abdominal surgery. I don't think women realise that. They see it as just another way of giving birth. They see it as easy. And they think that if they can have an elective caesarean they will have no pain because they haven't been in labour.' </p> <p>While acknowledging that labour is 'unbelievably painful', Silverton pointed out that the pain is temporary, unlike back pain, gallstones or kidney stones. She also claimed that women under 40 were more likely to have an 'epidural in a way that their predecessors wouldn't'.</p> <p>The senior midwife argued that in some cases she doubted the 'medical reasons' given by doctors for approving caesareans. Some women, tired after a long labour, were wrongly given a caesarean at 10pm to save doctors operating at 2am, when they should be left longer in case natural labour developed, she claimed.</p> <p>She also accused junior doctors of approving or undertaking emergency caesareans too quickly if there were any suggestion of risk to the child's health, because they feared they might be sued if something went wrong. </p> <p>'Currently, the caesarean rate [in England] is 24.3 per cent. Therefore one has to question whether the women of this country are physiologically incapable of having normal births, and I don't think they are,' said Silverton, a midwife for 30 years. She wants Britain's rate brought closer to the 15 per cent recommended by the World Health Organisation and fears caesareans 'have been normalised in the minds not just of women but also midwives and obstetricians'.</p> <p>She listed a caesarean's main dangers for mothers as 'the risk of infection, the effect on subsequent fertility and the effect on their ability to look after a newborn baby when they are post-operative'. There can also be respiratory complications for the baby, she added.</p> <p>Silverton and the Royal College are worried that women have lost confidence in their ability to go through natural labour. She blames that on a decline in antenatal classes and the fact that scattered families means there is less 'folk knowledge about childbirth'. </p> <p>The midwife shortage means that women have less time with them on antenatal visits than before, too. In addition 'the celebrity culture of having your baby and two weeks later being seen in a slinky dress, having lost weight, is affecting women's views of caesareans', Silverton added.</p> <p>Georgina Cooper's first experience of childbirth, in March, was what she had wanted: natural, in a birthing pool, with her husband, Doug, close by, constantly rubbing her back. But it also hurt a lot. 'The pain is the most intense pain you ever experience,' said Cooper, a charity press officer in London. 'But it's also different to any other pain because you know that at the end of it you're going to meet the baby you have been looking after inside you for nine months, which is exhilarating.'</p> <p>The 31-year-old, who called her daughter Martha, used yoga, swimming and reflexology to improve her chances of a vaginal delivery. But she is not a natural birth snob. 'I'm totally unjudgmental about how women choose to give birth,' she said.</p> <p>There were seven women in Cooper's National Childbirth Trust antenatal group and four had a caesarean. In each case, their condition involved an increased risk to mother or baby if exposed to the rigours of a normal delivery. One was carrying twins, another's baby was very premature. </p> <p>'While I feel really fulfilled from having had a natural birth, I don't feel more womanly because I did,' added Cooper.</p> <p>Many experts agreed, as they argued about Silverton's comments. 'It's very wrong to blame women for the caesarean rate being so high,' said Belinda Phipps, chief executive of the National Childbirth Trust. 'We do take more painkillers than we have ever before but that's not a cause of the caesarean rate being higher. </p> <p>'What matters the most is that we care very badly for women in labour, which makes them frightened. That's what makes labour a cascade of horribleness, leads to more intervention and puts up the caesarean rate.' </p> <p>She cited a recent study by the Healthcare Commission, the NHS watchdog in England, which found that one in five women were left alone during labour. That, and a shortage of up to 5,000 midwives, is the real reason behind the caesarean rate, according to Phipps. </p> <p>Organisations such as the British Medical Association and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) point out that the NHS does not have enough obstetricians to give women the quality of care needed. </p> <p>Dr Maggie Blott, a consultant obstetrician at University College Hospital, London and a RCOG spokeswoman on caesareans, insisted: 'There isn't any evidence to support Louise Silverton's view that increasingly pain-averse women are pushing up the caesarean rate. There's an undercurrent that caesarean sections are a bad thing, but they can be life-saving.' </p> <p>She conceded that there are 'a tiny number of women who want a caesarean even though medically they don't need one. Those women are probably less than 1 per cent of all those who have a caesarean.' That equates to roughly 1,700 of the 700,000 women a year who give birth in the UK.</p> <p>The safety of caesareans has improved significantly in the past 20 years. Natural births and planned caesareans now involve the same risk that the mother will die. But the risk of serious medical complications remain higher for surgical births. Those include what Blott calls 'infinitesimally small' risks that the woman might need a blood transfusion, catch an infection or have her bladder or bowel accidentally nicked during the surgery. </p> <p>However safe caesareans are today, a growing volume of evidence links the procedure to a range of often serious medical risks, such as stillbirth. A study published in August found that babies born that way are also 20 per cent more likely to develop Type 1 diabetes.</p> <p>Last year researchers from Oxford University said that caesarean deliveries reduced the risk during breech births, where the baby's lower body appears first in the birth canal. However, Dr Jose Villar's team also found that a woman having a caesarean ran twice the risk of suffering complications, including hysterectomy, blood transfusion and admission to intensive care. </p> <p>'Many women tell us they feel they are a failure if they have had a caesarean, even though they shouldn't,' said Siobhan Freegard, a co-founder of Netmums a social networking site for mothers. Anecdotal evidence suggests that this belief may help cause postnatal depression in some women, she added. </p> <p>Caesareans are a major talking point among women. A Netmums appeal for members to tell The Observer their story quickly yielded dozens of volunteers. </p> <p>Freegard deplores what she calls the belief among some women that only a natural birth will do. 'There's this unspoken presumption that if you have had a natural childbirth, you are more successful as a birth mother', she said.</p> <p>'I think the \"too posh to push\" tag has sullied the reputation of women who have had a caesarean. What's important is that you've got a safe, healthy baby, not how you got it. Every women who has a caesarean has their reason.'</p> <h2>'I had the moment of a newborn child being passed to me alive and well'</h2> <p><strong>Emma Batey, a 37-year-old schoolteacher from Sheffield, had both her children - Max, six, and Poppy, two - by caesarean section. </strong></p> <p>'When I was pregnant with Poppy, I joined a couple of online birth clubs, where the members are mainly middle-class, working mums and a lot of first-time mums. The expectation was that everyone was trying to have a natural birth, that natural birth was better. There was quite a widespread one-upmanship to see who could have their baby at home, be as drug-free as possible, or use a birthing pool or a midwife-led unit. </p> <p>'Some people do try to stigmatise it. There's this idea some women have one as the easy way out. But women shouldn't feel ashamed about having a caesarean. I feel no stigma about having had my children that way. Between me and my four close friends, four of us had a caesarean with our first baby for medical reasons, then had an elective with our second child, also for medical reasons. </p> <p>'My first child was stillborn in 2001. She died in the womb and I gave birth naturally - a horrific experience. In 2002 when Max was due I was dreading it, but looking forward to pushing out a live child this time. But after two days in labour and my son failing to progress, his heart rate was irregular and then dropped. I was petrified I would lose another baby, so when the consultant suggested a caesarean I said yes immediately. </p> <p>'Then before having Poppy I developed gestational diabetes, so there was a danger that the baby would be too large to come out safely, as Max had been. I had another caesarean on medical grounds. </p> <p>'When people ask if I regret having a caesarean, I always say no, because I still had the moment of having a newborn child passed to me alive and well. I missed out on the delivery, but nothing took away my joy at two beautiful, healthy babies.'</p> <h2>'They didn't even give me the option of holding my baby'</h2> <p><strong>Louise Hughes, aged 19 and from Cardiff, gave birth to her first child, Grace, last month.</strong></p> <p>'I feel I was pushed into having a caesarean. They didn't really give me options or speak to me about it. Nobody explained in detail what was going on. As it was my first baby, I would have liked to have known what was happening. The lack of information was really scary.</p> <p>'It was 8.15pm and I'd been in labour for over 15 hours by this stage and the baby's heart rate had dropped. The doctors came in and said that enough was enough and that they were taking me down for a caesarean.</p> <p>'Nobody said anything about potential risks. They were all on the consent form that they told me to read. </p> <p>'When Grace came out they didn't give me the option of holding her, even with the help of hospital staff. I really feel that I missed out. That meant I wasn't able to bond with her. For the first two days, I didn't want Grace near me. When she was crying I just wished she would shut up and that someone would come and take her away. </p> <p>'I didn't want to be around her because I'd had a caesarean and hadn't had the chance to bond with her when it mattered most, just after the birth.</p> <p>'I still feel guilty for not being able to bond and I hate myself for having thought like that. But that's how I felt. But that didn't last and now I just love her to pieces.'</p>",
  "<p>It is the exercise regime that has taken Britain by storm. One million men and women in the UK pull their tummies to their spine and breathe in a bid to achieve core stability.</p> <p>Pilates, once a fitness secret known to a select group of dancers and athletes, is today a multi-million pound industry. And the main reasons for its explosion in the UK are Lynne Robinson and Gordon Thompson. Together 12 years ago, they formed Body Control Pilates, a brand of the fitness system used by Liz Hurley, Sarah Ferguson and Olympic gold medal rowers James Cracknell and Matthew Pinsent. Former England cricket captain Michael Atherton says Body Control extended his injury-ridden career by several years. It is now the biggest Pilates business in the UK.</p> <p>But it is not just muscles that are straining among the British Pilates power brokers. In fact, it seems the Covent Garden-based exercise studio which is the Body Control nerve centre is not big enough for its two founders.</p> <p>Six weeks ago, Lynne Robinson and her husband demanded Thompson quit the business. Thompson refused. The dispute has escalated and, on Saturday, 850 Pilates teachers will be asked to 'expel' Gordon Thompson in an emergency vote. </p> <p>Thompson's alleged crime is his wish to devise his own unique style of Body Control 'machine work' under his name and charge money to instruct teachers. He has written to all Body Control teachers begging for clemency. It is expected to be a sweaty event.</p> <p>But the argument about technique is only a vehicle for a mighty personal clash between the First Lady of Pilates and the man who helped secure her status. Body Control has generated millions of pounds and, while Robinson has always been its face, Thompson has been instrumental from the start. Now he feels he deserves the right to establish his own brand.</p> <p>Thompson claims the move to oust him as a director is about 'greed'. He claims to have taught Robinson the technique she has now taken to the world. With Thompson, Robinson has sold nearly four million books and DVDs. But it is she, through television appearances, newspaper columns, commercial tie-ups with the likes of British Airways and Pilates retreats in Thailand, who has earned the status as the undisputed 'Queen of Pilates'. Earlier this month saw the release of her latest Pilates book targeted at the obese.</p> <p>Reacting to the attempt to expel him, Thompson, who is now based in a Kensington studio belonging to dancer Wayne Sleep, said: 'This is a dramatic overreaction. It should never have happened in the first place but this is about standing up for what I do.'</p> <p>Robinson's husband, Leigh, who is also a director of Body Control, accepts that Thompson has been instrumental in establishing Body Control but said: 'Gordon expressed an interest in setting up his own membership body. When we have a situation in which Gordon Thomson wants to do something on the side, it's something we have to talk about. We have a council that said this wasn't acceptable. It gives the wrong message.'</p> <p>The row is unlikely to halt the growth trajectory of Pilates in the UK. It has been adopted by fitness instructors and gyms throughout the land. It is a method of exercise and physical movement designed to stretch, strengthen, and balance the body. With systematic practice of specific exercises coupled with focused breathing patterns and emphasis on 'drawing in the pelvic floor', Pilates has been embraced by sports stars, actors and dancers. </p> <p>Exercises include the 'elephant' and the 'swan'. They can be carried out using just mats and a person's own body strength or with machines that, some argue, take it to another level with additional resistance and support.</p> <p>Devotees swear that Pilates leaves them bright-eyed, refreshed and buoyant without necessarily sweating. Women love it because it gives them flat tummies and toned muscles without bulking up. Elderly people swear by its ability to ease back complaints. Pilates now has became a mainstay in luxury spas. </p> <p>It was German-born Joseph Pilates, a sickly asthmatic child, who was living in England as a circus performer and boxer, who devised what he called Contrology when placed in forced internment in England at the outbreak of the First World War. </p> <p>He drew from yoga and Zen Buddhism and was inspired by the ancient Greek ideal of man perfected in development of body, mind and spirit. On his way to developing the Pilates Method, Joseph Pilates studied anatomy and developed himself as a body builder, wrestler, gymnast, boxer, skier and diver.</p> <p>It was escaping a request to train the German army that saw Pilates' career bloom. He went to New York City and trained dancers who pledged themselves to the party-loving German. He died in 1967 aged 87. </p> <p>Pilates took off in the Eighties when one of his devotees opened a studio above a hairdressing salon frequented by Barbra Streisand, Candice Bergen and Ali MacGraw. The stars found themselves drawn to the pastime and a fitness craze was born.</p> <p>The essence of Pilates is core stability. Together Lynne Robinson and Gordon Thompson adapted 'classical' Pilates exercises, which they believed were often unsuitable for the average person and the average body. </p> <p>Central to the method is 'awareness of your own body' and exercises are built around its eight basic principles: relaxation, concentration, co-ordination, centring, alignment, breathing, stamina and flowing movements.</p> <p>Lynne is famous for matwork which requires increasingly complex movement sequences. She claims to allow you handle stress effectively and achieve relaxation more easily.</p> <p>Gordon Thomson reckons there is room for him to develop a machine variant of body control Pilates, which he argues Lynne does not cover. To some, Pilates machines look like 'instruments of torture' but Gordon believes they help improve posture and achieve balanced grace.</p> <p>The first matwork teacher training course was held in 1996. The groundbreaking book Body Control The Pilates Way was the world's first curriculum based course book for prospective Pilates teachers. Since then nearly 1,000 students have trained using the technique. Countless books followed in the subsequent 12 years.</p>",
  "<p>It would be dark soon, we could tell, because the sun had dipped behind the far ridge of the absurdly picturesque valley, but there didn't seem to be any urgency to return to our bungalow. The tea country of the Western Ghats in southern India, the knuckle of mountains separating lush Kerala from the plains of Tamil Nadu, is tranquil to the point of caricature and the only danger lay in the eyes of our seven-year-old, Esme, who feared we might encounter more tea pickers. </p> <p>Earlier, walking up from the bungalow which had once belonged to the English manager of the vast Tallayar estate, the last of these to finish work had descended past us. Three women, Tamils wearing saris, had pinched Esme's cheeks so hard her smile had morphed into a grimace. Now the tea pickers had all reached their homes further down the valley, from where later in the dark we would hear Tamil film music drifting up. Instead, we were stopped by the recently installed manager of the estate, having first been alerted to his presence by the growl of his gleaming Enfield motorbike. Elephants, he said, roamed these hillsides; and yes, they could be very dangerous and yes, we'd best hurry back to the bungalow.</p> <p>Packing for this two-week adventure, we had not counted being savaged by wild pachyderms among the possible dangers. Instead, there had been questions about what would Sam and Esme eat and what sort of malaria pills should we take, or would they be simply overwhelmed by the country itself. Before Zoe and I met we had both travelled around India. The three weeks I'd spent in the south with a gang of teenage mates, rucksacks filled with filthy washing on our backs, had left me with the potentially foolhardy idea of wanting to instil the fascination I'd felt with this part of the world in two under-10s whose <em>weltanschauung</em> had hitherto been bound by Ryanair's flight routes.</p> <p>Kerala's history is intertwined with that of travellers seduced by its spectacular beauty. In Cochin, to which we flew via Sri Lanka, there is still - just about - one of the oldest Jewish diaspora communities in the world as well as India's oldest European church, St Francis, where the explorer Vasco da Gama was originally buried. </p> <p>Our own journey had seen Zoe pick up a bug on the flight, and the family's entrance into the country had been heralded by a fellow passenger announcing to the stewardesses, 'she is vomiting', with the sort of hard, percussive 'v' and elongated vowel sound that also announces India. So much for the children's welfare.</p> <p>But this was a holiday at which we were chucking the savings, and whereas last time it had been trains and buses, now we were met by our own car and driver, the heroic Rajesh, with whom we weaved calmly north for an hour-and-a-half to what we could see, in the warm light of morning, were the Athirapally Falls. This is a popular spot for local tourists, and the view from our adjoining bedrooms at our eco-friendly hotel of the Chalakudy River crashing down 80 feet was spectacular. </p> <p>The falls had also attracted a film crew shooting a Malayalam movie in the forest when Sam, Esme and I sweated past later in the heat, with a chorus line of extras and a troop of monkeys waiting in the shade. For the children, it immediately felt very different from the school playground on a Friday afternoon, and later, on a drive deeper into the forest, we saw deer and a giant red squirrel, but no elephants here either, despite the promised chance of a sighting.</p> <p>The deal had been that we would split the trip between wildlife, beach and culture and next morning, with Zoe recovered, we drove back to Cochin. The route was initially through lush countryside, with Rajesh pointing out the banana trees, tapioca, rubber trees and much more, as if this were a botany lesson. This is a fertile land for religion, too, and beside the temples and mosques, there were huge churches with gaudy paint jobs to enable them compete with their Hindu counterparts. Imposing mansions also studded the roadside, evidence of Kerala's growing prosperity.</p> <p>Long the most literate state in India, it is benefiting from workers at every level, from construction workers to medics, sending money home from newfound jobs in the Gulf. Tourism plays its part, too, and in Cochin the sort of boutique hotel that simply didn't exist in India twenty years ago - backpacker's budget or not -was awaiting us. </p> <p>Before dinner in the courtyard of the chic Malabar House, there was the inevitable visit to the city's famous Chinese fishing nets and then to a kathakali show. Genuine performances of this ancient form of dance-drama apparently last through the night, but even though this show was thankfully truncated and the protagonists looked spectacular in their lurid make-up, there was still the question of why the children should be subjected to it when I had suffered a similar show that had bored me close to tears 20 years ago. But it proved a surprise hit thanks to the woman who explained the action to the audience and could have passed for Les Dawson in drag; coincidentally, she also shared his comic timing.</p> <p>'What you will see now is the emotion of anger,' she would mutter. And the dancer would half raise an eyebrow. 'Now you will see the emotion of joy.' The same chap would curl his lip. The subtleties passed us by, and I'm afraid to say that for the next 10 days, kathakali became a running joke in the family.</p> <p>The cultural trail was leading us to Madurai across the Western Ghats in Tamil Nadu, but to break the nine-hour drive we stopped for the night in tea country, 45 minutes on from the town of Munnar. En route, the children were entertained by the scenery but also by a CD of the Just William stories we'd brought with us to play on the car stereo; it turned out that the sound of Martin Jarvis recounting the adventures of William, Ginger, Douglas et al proved the most apposite soundtrack to our arrival at the Tallayar Estate bungalow - a perfect throwback to the Raj. Delphiniums and forget-me-nots prettified the garden and the strawberries were just coming into season; later, the cook asked the children to identify the veg patch cauliflower they fancied for dinner. We were the only guests, treated to vast bedrooms and chipped ceramic baths, and the cook and housekeeper were there at 4am to see us off.</p> <p>The early start wasn't in the itinerary (however relentless it seemed), but the stoic Rajesh had been alarmed by news of a hartal - a strike - called to protest against rising fuel prices in Kerala. So we wound through the mountains as dawn crept up - privilege to the most spectacular views - in order to make the state border before angry picket lines could stop us; Rajesh was genuinely relieved when we made it down into the plains without incident. </p> <p>The ancient city of Madurai with its rubbish-strewn streets served as a sharp contrast to the more genteel charms of Cochin. But to visit its stellar attraction, the Meenakshi temple, we took rickshaws from the hotel and the children loved the mayhem of our race there. If ever any journey made a mockery of the demand that they put their seat belts on when in the car back home, this was it. </p> <p>The vast temple complex, with its 12 gopurams, beats an Anglican church hands down when it comes to child-friendliness, too: we could pad around barefoot, play hide and seek among the sculptures, visit the temple shops - and gain a keen sense of a religion practised in near-unbroken form for millennia. Sam said later that the temple was - and here he adopted the sort of formulation that would see Rajev tell us that from Madurai to our next destination it was 'near ... and also far' - both 'boring and ... interesting'. Serious praise.</p> <p>In Madurai we also visited a tailor, who kitted out both children in Indian clothes, which seemed like a further measure of their acclimatisation. The food, too, was proving a breeze - the idea of a curry provoked few fears, with biscuits and bananas coming to the rescue if there really wasn't anything they fancied. Only a ritual of our own cast a pall; advice on whether it was really necessary to take precautions against malaria in southern India was mixed, which meant that the children were bullied into wolfing down their bitter pills every evening before dinner. This, Esme maintains, was, cheek-pinchers included, 'the absolute worst thing about India'.</p> <p>From Madurai it was a scramble back to the coast, but the journey was broken by two nights at the Periyar Wildlife park, the biggest in south India. The first time I had visited here, if memory serves, there were few buildings and little in the way of hotels and it was in the adjacent town of Thekkady that my friends and I had been approached by a wiry fellow asking, 'sirs, would you be interested in seeing marijuana growing?', followed by his sales pitch. Now it was shop owners inviting us in to look at artefacts from around the country - pashminas from Kashmir and such like. The advantage of Periyar remains that it is easy to visit - a vast artificial lake dominates the park and every hour three or four boats with Indian honeymooners and Western tourists sputter off across the water.</p> <p>But first we hired a guide to take us walking into the jungle, which meant more monkeys and a raccoon, as well as tiger scratch marks but no tigers and no elephants. Easy to imagine they were scared off by the occasional moan from a child still sweltering in the becalming, relative coolness of the thick interior. But it was still fantastically like The Jungle Book. Later, the boat ride proved restive, apart from the sudden frenzied gesticulation necessary when anyone thought they had spotted a big beast on the shore. Sadly, they were only deer.</p> <p>Never mind, because next day, finally there were elephants, tame ones that we rode around a patch of jungle in Thekkady. The Madurai rickshaw race was recreated at ambling pace - the danger now in the possibility of Zoe panicking and falling off. This was, Esme later said, 'the best thing we did in India'.</p> <p>From there, we bumped down towards the sea, entering the part of Kerala famous for its luscious backwaters, where the distinction between land and water threatens to disappear. First we stopped for two nights at an absurdly luxurious hotel called Privacy on the shores of the vast Lake Vembanad and then hit a beach resort.</p> <p>This stretch of the frenzied journey served as a reward for everyone - lazing by the swimming pool, cycling through country lanes, being buffeted by the warm waves of the Arabian Sea, drifting through backwaters in a modified canoe. By this stage, for the adults, there was little of the sense of adventure that had characterised our earlier trips to India, though we continued to marvel at recent developments in the country that made our lives easier now - such as functioning cash points. But every day brought something new to Sam and Esme.</p> <p>The only shame was that we had to part company with Rajesh who, like everyone we met, could not have been nicer to the children. Sam gashed his foot in the pool at Privacy but by then Zoe and I were beyond worrying. The junior contingent started moaning, but only that we absolutely had to return to Kerala at the earliest possible opportunity.</p> <h2>Essentials</h2> <p>Caspar Llewellyn Smith travelled with Transindus (020 8566 2729; <a href=\"http://www.transindus.com\">transindus.com</a>).

  "<h2>Assisted suicide is not the right solution </h2> <p>Mary Warnock's article 'Legalise assisted suicide for pity's sake' (Comment, last week) is an extraordinarily subjective view. Those of us who unexpectedly acquire severe disability in adult life have in our turn experienced the fear that our talents may never be fulfilled, the hatred of the profusion of medics who cannot cure us and the jealousy of other impairments that in our confusion seem more bearable. However, amazingly quickly I lose all interest in the nature of other people's impairments and form my judgments of them simply as people.</p> <p>Being told that time is a great healer can make any of us resentful. Would others have thought that after 22 years' severe impairment, obliged to spend three-quarters of my life in bed and the rest using a wheelchair and shortly after receiving a life sentence of terminal cancer with a six-month prognosis that I would then rediscover and marry my childhood sweetheart at the age of 59? Even more infuriating is to be told there are others worse off than ourselves. At the time, it seems irrelevant.</p> <p>So I feel as deeply for all those who may never recover from the despair that they failed to save Daniel James from the unmapped minefield in which he felt stuck, as I do for Daniel himself because the map of similar minefields has been charted by millions of equally, or even more, disabled people. After all, statistically we constitute one in four of the UK population. So the real blame has to lie with the failure of our media to present the images, stories, achievements and role model status of previous disabled people that should have penetrated society's and Daniel's consciousness.</p> <p>Easier access, as Mary Warnock suggests, for similar assisted suicides will leave us all culpable for even greater losses that may prove much harder to live with than the experience of disability itself. <br><strong>Paddy Masefield </strong><br>Patron of the Coalition of Disabled People South Devon<br>Newton Abbot, Devon</p> <p>As the mother of a young man who committed suicide without assistance, I would like to record my disagreement with the view that a person such as Daniel James should be helped to die. He apparently felt that his life was full of 'terror, discomfort and indignity', suggesting a need for better support. The need for help should not be seen as undignified, but as something we all have to varying degrees throughout our lives. Independence means having more than one source of help; it should not be confused with self-sufficiency. </p> <p>Until his last hours, my son looked for help, but in vain. To agree to assist a suicide is to agree a person should die. To me, that shows not respect but, rather, its lack.<br><strong>Virginia Low</strong><br>London N1</p> <h2>No smear here</h2> <p>'Smear claim hits Russian billionaire' (News, last week), suggested evidence of a smear campaign by businessman Oleg Deripaska against Michael Cherney. The evidence cited, from a court case under appeal, is a letter from a PR firm, Mirepco, to Mr Sam Berkovits, 'a legal consultant to Deripaska's Basic Element conglomerate'. The fact is that Mr Deripaska has never met nor communicated with Mr Berkovits in any capacity. He has never given Mr Deripaska advice or been asked by him to provide any services of any nature whatever, legal or otherwise. Similarly, Mirepco has never provided any PR services to him or any of his companies.</p> <p>With Companies House records showing Mirepco is in fact owned by Samuel and Tova Berkovits and worth a princely \u00a32, it seems clear Mr Deripaska is not the instigator of a smear campaign but the victim of one.<br><strong>Sergey Babichenko</strong><br>Office of the Chairman of the Supervisory Board, <br>Basic Element Company<br>Moscow </p> <h2>In defence of Barbara Follett</h2> <p>As a resident of Stevenage, I was disappointed to see Victoria Coren's normally well-aimed pen pointing at our MP Barbara Follett ('There's nothing wrong with Cheryl and the WAGs, 7 Days, last week). I agree that the acronym is reductive, but isn't she missing the point? The WAGs' success surely arises mainly from the pursuit of wealth and fame. It is then often sustained through the success of their boyfriend or husband.</p> <p>Certainly the name Follett merits some comparison but, so far as I can see, that's where any similarity ends. Barbara's first husband Richard Turner, a critic of the apartheid system, was murdered in their daughters' bedroom in South Africa in 1978, four months after Steve Biko's death. Before that, a farm worker's baby son had died in her arms. I have always thought that it was these experiences that moulded Barbara rather than the pursuit of wealth or fame. </p> <p>If she pursues anything, it's injustice. <br><strong>Laurence Arnold</strong><br>Stevenage, Hertfordshire</p> <h2>Rogue Mail</h2> <p>Peter Preston's absolute belief in the infallibility of journalists and their divine right to guaranteed freedom of the means to gather news totally skews and devalues his analysis. </p> <p>He has scoffed at the judge who sent a journalist to prison for breaking the law. He believes the so-called Press Complaints Commission is dressed in shining armour. And now he admits he is 'a little ashamed' at the Daily Mail's appalling and degrading homophobic attacks on Lord Mandelson. Only a 'little'? ('Mandy can lord it over snarling, sneering Mail', Media, last week). They make me deeply, deeply ashamed of the trade I worked in. One must assume that the Mail's editor, Paul Dacre, accepts or even agrees with the views expressed by his columnists and journalists. Undeniably, he gives licence to his readers to employ similar epithets and views and he must therefore be held responsible for the violence that regrettably but inevitably follows from such expressions of hatred. I trust Lord Mandelson will give Mr Dacre's boss a very hard time in the House of Lords.<br><strong>Anthony Millett</strong><br>Marlborough, Wiltshire</p> <h2>Water, water everywhere ...</h2> <p>Just why are we continuing with the landscape-disfiguring windfarms when there are many other ways to lessen carbon emissions ('UK wind farm plans on brink of failure', News, last week)?</p> <p>Near where I live, there are three former watermills, a pattern which is probably repeated all over the country.

  "<p>I'm an independent TV producer desperate to get my shows to rate. We've a show on BBC Three at the moment, Make My Body Younger, in which we carry out what looks like a live autopsy on various 20-year-olds to examine the damage they are doing to their bodies. Combustible, emotional TV, we hope, something which made it rate moderately well the first time it went out. But I know, as do all TV execs, that if only I could find a way of getting sex in the title, or the show, it would make it rate on a different scale. </p> <p>When I worked at the BBC our working mantra was about 'unnecessarily raising the creative bar'- not just giving the people what they wanted, but also trying to make shows which they didn't yet know they wanted.</p> <p>But now, as an 'indie', I'm commissioned to supply what the broadcaster wants, whichever broadcaster it is, and at the forefront of my mind is trying to make sure the viewers get absolutely what they want. I never really give a second thought as to whether this is bad for the nation's psychological health and even if I did, who am I to criticise if the public enjoys shows about sex?</p> <p>I sort of come unstuck when I'm with my kids - two chatty, well-balanced boys. I'd hate to think that they would grow up in a society where the media leans even more towards sexifying everything it produces. At the same time, I'd hoped that by being open about sex with the kids, I would be able to 'de-snigger' their questions. You wouldn't be able to get more medical. It would be like an episode of Casualty, but a rude episode, perhaps one reserved for Christmas or Easter.</p> <p>Such is my level of superficiality and cultural narrow-mindedness, this approach was stolen straight from, you guessed it, a TV show. It was called Sex... with Mum and Dad and featured a Dutch sexologist, Maria Schopman, who explained that by teaching kids about sex, they grow up to respect it, and in turn a generation will emerge who don't experience the same terrifying statistics of teenage pregnancy and, I guess, STDs. </p> <p>I took my sons to Paris this summer. The day before I arrived I was told that there would be 'working women' outside the house I'd rented. With Maria Schopman in mind, I told the kids that there would be a lady called a 'prostitute' outside the house.</p> <p>'What's a prostitute?' asked the eight-year-old.</p> <p>'Well, they are ladies whom you pay to see their bodies.'</p> <p>'How much?' he asked as he started to unzip his bag to check he had enough of his 10\u20ac spending money left.</p> <p>Don't laugh, I told myself. Remember the Dutch expert.</p> <p>'I don't know - 20 quid.'</p> <p>And then - both together - as though we were at Alton Towers outside the Corkscrew ride: 'Can we have a go?'</p> <p>'No no, you can't have a go. And you don't say \"have a go.\" You need to respect these ladies... And anyway, you need to be 18.'</p> <p>That's right, Daddy - it's not a moral issue, it's about age.</p> <p>The six-year-old leaned forward and asked: 'Daddy, can't you just tell them I'm a dwarf?'</p> <p>Clearly, the fascination will always be there, and we TV executives use it constantly. At a recent pitch for shows for the launch night of Virgin One, the very smart commissioner said they had lots in the schedule but needed a huge rating show. As an indie, you can make any shows for any broadcaster, and our company makes everything from high-end documentaries (we're doing shows with Heston Blumenthal and Philippe Starck), to quizzes (Are you Smarter Than a Ten Year Old?, with Noel Edmonds and Dick and Dom), to comedy and drama.</p> <p>'You need a big rating show, eh? I'll give you a big rating show.' I paused for dramatic effect. 'I am thinking of a competitive series - like The Apprentice.'</p> <p>The commissioners lean in - they are liking this.</p> <p>'But unlike The Apprentice, we make it a competition which doesn't have a central Alan Sugar character... And instead of it being a job they win, it's a prize money can't buy.'</p> <p>They are hooked. Look at their eyes. I am saving their channel. Even before it's been launched. 'Why don't we do a 10-part series called... Britain's Biggest Penis?'</p> <p>Stunned. They're stunned. I'm speechless. What was that about? Christ, I've got a degree. And kids. No, calm down, they are in private school - this will cover the next few lessons on Greek mythology. Complete silence. You could hear a career drop.</p> <p>'Well, it certainly adds another flavour to the mix.'</p> <p>And so, two weeks later, we were in production, slightly apologetically, with Penis Envy and eight weeks later it was transmitted on launch night, to stonking ratings. And every time the show transmits it rates again and again, with its highest rating coming on its seventh transmission. A total of 3.3 million people have now watched it. </p> <p>In fact, if you tune in tonight it will probably be on again. (The follow-up show in this seminal trilogy was Boob Envy, which also rated very well. Though, sadly, the third, Money Envy, didn't.)</p> <p>Don't get the wrong impression - this show isn't the 'Live TV' of the Eighties, with a topless newsreader. It's a soft psychological look at envy, but we and the channel were not blind to the fact that the title pulled in viewers. Presumably, men explained to their partners that they wanted to watch Penis Envy not because they themselves were envious, you understand, but because they wanted to get inside the minds of those who were. These things are important, darling.</p> <p>I used to be controller of BBC Three, where the pressures were very different. The BBC is more than just a broadcaster - it's a quasi-cultural institution populated, for the most part, with very well-meaning, intellectually curious, slightly left-leaning liberals. People often use the word 'nice' to describe the place and, four years after I left, I think that sums it up, in both a good and bad way. Kind, slightly wet, bumbling, pleasant, with moments - to be fair, great long periods - of complete genius.</p> <p>But the role that sex plays in the BBC is complicated. There's an acknowledgment that the BBC has to re-engage with younger audiences who generally don't see sex as anything to be ashamed of. On the other hand, however, it's also possible that sex in the BBC is not seen as something to be celebrated, and it's here where the approach of the BBC differs markedly from that of Five and Channel Four. </p> <p>Still, whenever we had to send an advance schedule out to newspapers and hadn't decided on a title for a show, instead of putting a holding title of TBC until we had decided, we laughed that we ought to just put Sex there, so that people would come to it but would possibly be too embarrassed to complain at a later date.</p> <p>For most people under 35, the majority of the media they consume treats sex in either a jokey or a relaxed way - there's less clenching, fewer judgmental overtones, and never a need to justify its presence somewhere with educational leaflets. Heat magazine will let us know when a couple have consummated a relationship in the Big Brother house and I think audiences increasingly take this for granted.</p> <p>Some in this audience see sex as a hobby - something to do on a night out. For some, it's a skill - something they want to know more about, be good at. And for others, it's great recreation as a non-participator - they love porn. To treat sex as something to be analysed, and to be revered, or something which is purely educational, can feel out of kilter with a modern sensibility. </p> <p>At the BBC there's a weekly meeting called programme review. Thirty or so of the most senior channel controllers and programme bosses in the TV bit of the corporation sit around a 20-foot table somewhere at Television Centre, and discuss that week's output, usually focusing on three shows in particular. I used to chair it towards the end of my time at the BBC with my boss, Jana Bennett, to my left. One week we were discussing Holiday and, in front of the bosses of that show, we had to all suggest why it wasn't working. </p> <p>There are probably a few reasons why it wasn't rating - the fact that people go on lots of different types of holidays now; it was formulaic; adventure shows such as Tribe were coming down the line. But there was certainly something about the presenters, or at least the way the presenters were produced. They were seemingly sexless, or saccharine or androgynous. The likes of Anthea Turner and Craig Doyle, while funny, spiky and sexy in real life, were being put forward as without attitude, fully rounded, effortlessly predictable, at a time when mainstream audiences on other channels were drawing in millions of viewers to watch people such as Chris Tarrant, Gordon Ramsay, Davina McCall and Phil and Kirstie, who were anything but. </p> <p>And we were asking why this was the case. What was it about the BBC wash that drained the colour and the sexiness out of people? Why was it that even when the BBC hired presenters who were sexy on other channels, did they feel somehow out of place on the corporation's output?</p> <p>There's a phrase I heard a lot at the BBC. Some people were said to come from 'Planet News'. People from Planet News were de-sexed and a bit weird (watching them dance in fishnets on Comic Relief is like watching your mum fellate your dad - I am sure it happens on bank holidays, I just never ever want to witness it). There have clearly been great leaps forward - the Fiona Bruce years have revived viewer libido after more than a century and a half of damage by Peter Sissons; and Jeremy Paxman has done his British best to keep discussion of his underpants top of the news agenda, leading to him apparently introducing the show as 'Newstight' on one occasion, though I missed it. I was watching Penis Envy on the other side.</p> <p>I think ITN has always had the slight edge in this area, which is why I was surprised to hear ITN's Mark Austin apparently complain about the rise of the 'autocutie'. From what I understand, he was not just complaining about people reading the news who haven't been out in the field, but also about them being good looking as well. Doesn't Mark realise the two things are connected? They are good looking because they haven't been out in the field. You wouldn't get Natasha Kaplinsky running around Chechnya, not unless Space NK had just opened a new branch and had a sale on.</p> <p>Surely it makes sense to have great-looking idiots - and I'm not referring to Natasha, who is very bright - reading the news. If you're going to have someone tell you about war, economic meltdown and political corruption, then it's better to be told by someone good looking. If I'm going to be told that I've got six months to live, I'd rather someone had made the effort to dress nicely or put on some make-up. Soften the blow a bit. </p> <p>It's such a British thing to think that we can't have intellectual gravitas and sexiness. And it's not just presenters. Mal Young, the TV genius behind many of the teams on the great powerhouses of British TV, including Brookside and EastEnders, said British sexiness was about hiring actors who were only slightly more attractive than your next-door neighbour. </p> <p>TV creates the television the nation wants. The States created unattainables such as Pamela Anderson and Beverly Hills 90210, while we create Claire Sweeney, Abi Titmuss, Shane Richie and - at the hotter end - the likes of James McAvoy and Sarah Parish. Still great looking but not quite Italian Vogue. They are, as Young would have it, seven and a half out of ten, sort of 'gettable'. In short, the better looking people in the pub. </p> <p>\u2022 Stuart Murphy is creative director of Twofour Broadcast. He was the youngest ever controller at the BBC, and launched BBC Three</p>",

Residents, tourists, businessmen and women passing through - anyone who fancies a bit of sex with 'NSA' (no-strings-attached) can announce it to the world and watch the offers roll in. On Craigslist, they don't have to pay anything or even go through the motions of registering a username and password. This is internet sex: as free and easy as it comes.</p> <p>The homepage of Craigslist, one of the world's most popular listings sites, offers flats and houses, holiday rentals, bikes, boats, books for sale, and jobs in just about every sector imaginable. Alongside this classic classifieds fare are personals, some romantic, some for one night only. Just a few mouse clicks away, it seems, the logical conclusion of a consumer age where time is short and convenience expected. Or as the title of Mark Ravenhill's play had it: Shopping and Fucking.</p> <p>'It's like ordering a pizza,' says Emily Dubberley, author of Brief Encounters: The Women's Guide to Casual Sex, and founder of the charity campaign Burlesque Against Breast Cancer. </p> <p>'In the past if someone suddenly felt horny they probably wouldn't bother going to a pub, or even joining a dating site to say, \"Do you fancy it?\" because that would be a bit weird, so they'd just sort themselves out. Now it's very available and convenient. But there's something a bit more sordid about it when you don't even have to make the remotest connection such as, \"Do you fancy a pint?\" At least then there would be a flirtation and catching of the eye. Now you can just go online and order genitalia. It's taken sex to its absolute base level.'</p> <p>Entire histories have been written about how the growth of the internet had nothing to do with knowledge and everything to do with pornography. But just as the net has transformed from a passive one-way street into an interactive 'Web 2.0' where users are creators, so the days of computers being little more than digital porn magazines are gone.</p> <p>The web has become a place through which to contact, meet and have sex with real people, to fulfil the wildest fantasy in the flesh. Cybersex is no longer about merely looking; it is about doing. What no one can yet understand is how this will change the social etiquettes of the past, or how fundamentally it is shifting the dynamics of sex and relationships.</p> <p>Some sites are quite explicit about their offerings. AdultFriendFinder claims to be the world's biggest adult social network and sex personals site. Its homepage proclaims, 'Meet real sex partners tonight!' beside a picture of a young woman taking off her bra and pouting at the camera. Below there are a series of photos and videos of women with names like 'sexygirl', 'freakychick', 'angelfirelady' and 'sugarbabe'. The site claims to have more than 2.5 million members registered in the UK, and that tens of thousands are logged in at this very moment. Just log in and you could meet your match.</p> <p>Other sites quite evidently do as they promise, such as Hookuparea.com and BeNaughty.com. And when a marriage is under strain, spouses no longer have to go very far out of their way to cheat. Illicit Encounters asks on its homepage: 'Married but Feeling neglected? In need of some excitement? A discreet and confidential extra-marital dating service for women and men... Whatever your reason, we can help. You may be locked in a loveless marriage, starved of attention and affection, partner away or too tired to pay you the attention you deserve, nonexistent love life? Or just looking for some excitement in your life? But you don't want to end your marriage either. Here you can meet people just like you, in absolute confidence.'</p> <p><strong>Peter Lines, 43, from West Yorkshire, met</strong><strong> </strong><strong>his</strong> current partner through the site when he decided that his marriage was loveless and beyond salvation. He did not want to ruin his children's lives so continues to live with his wife in an entirely platonic relationship. He says his current partner was in an identical predicament. 'Morally, we haven't got a leg to stand on, but what's a person to do?' he asks.</p> <p>Lines has since become a co-owner of Illicit Encounters, which launched in October 2003 and now has 245,000 members, mostly in the UK. Sixty-five per cent of them are male, and 35 per cent female, a smaller disparity than most dating sites. Women are on average 36\u00bd years old, men 38\u00bd. Applicants are required to answer up to 50 questions and fill in a profile. Of around 800 applications received every day, on average 550 are rejected for reasons such as age (people under 25 are discouraged) or personality (self-evident sex maniacs are not welcome).</p> <p>Lines says that the site is made up of very ordinary people like you and me. 'It's the man and woman in the street, the person in the Sainsbury's queue, the person in the office you would never expect. There are no raging tarts or slobbering lotharios. The membership are primarily people trapped in a marriage and they can't get out for all sorts of reasons. We did a survey and 71 per cent of people said that if they weren't having an affair they'd be getting a divorce.'</p> <p>The internet has made it possible in ways that would have been unthinkable 15 years ago. Lines adds: 'People in this situation are far more active online than they would be in real life. They wouldn't go to a bar or another public place to chat to people for many reasons, some of them obvious.'</p> <p>The site provides a guide on how to conduct an illicit affair, with advice tips including using a separate SIM card in their mobile phone, paying with cash instead of credit cards and never giving their surname, exact location or workplace. But he denies the site is providing an immoral cheats' charter. 'We say to everyone that we don't encourage them to have an affair. We make it very clear on every page that you've got to think hard about this; it's not a substitute for working on your marriage; only do it if your marriage cannot be saved and there's no way back.'</p> <p>Not for the first time, homosexuals have been at the cutting edge of sexual and social trends. Gaydar, the networking site for gay men - tagline 'What you want, when you want it' - has arguably done more than any other site to make casual sex an integral part of the web. Founded in 1999 by Gary Frisch and his partner Henry Badenhorst in a tiny office in south-west London, it soon became the online equivalent of the gay bar, a safe place to meet, talk and, of course, 'get laid'. Gaydar is now one of the biggest dating sites on the web with millions of members around the world. The 'A' countries alone with registered users are Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Angola, Argentina, Aruba, Australia, Austria and Azerbaijan.</p> <p>Gaydar is sex shopping writ large, with every specific taste catered for. A user's profile has a basic checklist: height, body type, ethnic origins, out (of the closet, that is), dick size, body hair, orientation (gay or bisexual), role (active, passive or versatile), safer sex (yes or no), smoke and drink. Anyone who fails to </p> <p>...#8592; post a photograph is less likely to be successful in finding an assignation. Those who do can turn up in a new city anywhere in the world, advertise their availability and be having sex an hour later.</p> <p>This is perhaps the most spectacular illustration of how the internet has changed everyday behaviour. Gays bars and clubs are said to have suffered a downturn because men are sitting at computers instead; an article in the Economist magazine attributed a slump at Manchester's Canal Street gay quarter directly to Gaydar. Cottaging in toilets or bushes, in places such as Hampstead Heath, has reportedly declined or even vanished because sex is so readily available via broadband. The author and Gaydar user Mark Simpson once observed: 'If Joe Orton had his time again his diaries would have been just printouts of thousands of Gaydar profiles and alarming digicam photos.'</p> <p>The process even formed the subject of a one-man show, Sex Addict, which caused controversy in 2004 when author Tim Fountain invited Edinburgh Festival audiences to watch him trawl Gaydar each night to arrange a sexual encounter, then report back the following day. Fountain has since admitted that the site can become addictive, a confusion of ends and means. 'I know so many gay men who will literally have Gaydar ticking away all the time, wherever they are, in the corner of the room while they are watching TV,' Fountain, the author of a new book about the sex lives of the British, Rude Britannia, told the Guardian last year.</p> <p>'That's the worst thing, it's a terrible time waster. You can very quickly think, \"Oh, I'll just log on and check my messages,\" and four hours later you find yourself weeing on someone's pillow in Willesden Green wondering, \"What the hell am I doing here?\" Sometimes you think, \"Christ, am I still online? I was meant to being doing something else.\" The whole web dating thing, gay or straight - on the one hand, it does link people up, but they are not socialising, they are not meeting in bars. They are just sitting talking down a line, ordering what they want, when they want it. That can be a very narrow thing.'</p> <p><strong>For all its popularity, Gaydar can be regarded</strong><strong> </strong><strong>as</strong><strong> </strong>a niche. Not so Craigslist or its rival, Gumtree, which published research last year showing that one in 10 British adults between the ages of 25 and 40 had gone online for casual sex. Nor, indeed, the darlings of the web, social networking sites such as Facebook. This runs the gamut, bringing together business contacts, old school and university friends and former lovers. At one end of the spectrum, a site which invites members to 'poke' each other and features countless photos of drunken revelry inevitably features casual sex too.</p> <p>Earlier this year it emerged that Laura Michaels, 23, had set up a group called 'I Need Sex' on the Facebook site and, she claimed, slept with 50 men. Within 10 minutes the group had 35 members and soon attracted 100 men, 50 of whom Michaels slept with after vetting their pictures. One of her Facebook conquests was called Simon from Swindon, whom she met for drinks in a bar in her hometown of Bristol before going back to his hotel room for sex. Facebook later removed the page.</p> <p>Michaels told the Sun about her experiences: 'We always met somewhere like a bar first and I would get dressed up and treat it like a date. I know that some people will really look down on me for it. They might even say that I may as well have been a prostitute because then I would at least have been paid for sleeping with so many different blokes, but I don't see it like that at all. I was satisfying my own desires by setting up the group. I feel like a free, liberated woman and I think it's fantastic that the internet gave me a chance to do this. I know that it was risky behaviour but that was part of the thrill. I always made sure to tell a friend I trusted where I was going.'</p> <p>Facebook, MySpace and Bebo's tens of millions of members can communicate with each other via Zoosk, which claims to be the biggest social dating network in the world. It offers the chance to 'choose a network and start mingling with thousands of cute singles in your area'. It could well appeal to people who would never dream of visiting an all-out casual sex site but don't see the harm of a simple mouse click which adds the Zoosk application to their profile page, the first step on a slippery slope. The web abounds with questions such as 'What would you do if you found your husband added the \"zoosk\" application on Facebook?' and 'Does Zoosk randomly flirt with people'?</p> <p>The online sex revolution is posing new questions for experts who have not seen anything quite like this before. Phillip Hodson, a psychotherapist and broadcaster, says: 'I do believe the internet is the world's largest sex aid, largely functioning to augment, magnify and super-speed the processes of dating. Therefore it does represent a \"step difference\", a difference of kind and not just one of degree over traditional mating behaviour. You could never flirt with so many people in your entire life in, say, the Fifties as you can today in one un-enchanted evening. The web - soon to be the instantaneous grid - allows people of high libido (and flexible morals) to find each other as never before.'</p> <p>But, according to Hodson, the web might be making sex too easy, so we end up having less rather than more. 'All new media have pros and cons, pluses and minuses,' she says. 'Undoubtedly adultery is easier to organise by email but there is a new risk of detection given the electronic trail and the dangers of interception or misdirection - for example \"Hello Lover!\" ending up in your boss's inbox. </p> <p>'I think that the internet, by providing pornography and promiscuity on a plate, does tend to lower the nation's overall libido. In order to feel sexy, we need a few more challenges than unlimitedporninanyposition.org or Hookersin30minutestoyourdoor.co.uk. Men in particular seem to me to be in danger of becoming \"sex lazy\" as well as more fickle.'</p> <p>Indeed the paradox of the throwaway, instant gratification subculture could be that, like a drug, gratification becomes less and less satisfying. No one can share the sentiment expressed in Oscar Wilde's play The Importance of Being Earnest: 'This suspense is terrible. I hope it will last!' It is not only romance that is dead but also the theatre of seduction, the hint of stocking replaced by a brazen sexuality that is about as erotic as a prostitute's calling card in a phone box. Cinema and restaurant dates are replaced by profiles and pokes. </p> <p>The era when you married the boy or girl next door, or your childhood sweetheart, in the same village church as your parents, has long been on the wane. But when love is cheap, the internet generation may be less inclined to get married at all.</p> <p>Dr Aric Sigman, a psychologist and biologist, says: 'I would be concerned that what we are seeing is unrealistic. Yes, you can have sex, but you are now having more people than ever living alone and never getting married. Even as the technology advances, men and women are less engaged than ever before. There is something about chemistry and nuance that is not conveyed by this IT.</p> <p>'This is doing something odd to the human condition that isn't clear yet. In luring people away from strong personal relationships, it could be that people are having less sex, not more. I'm not convinced that it's making us any happier.'</p> <h2>How to identify cheating spouses</h2> <p><strong>1 </strong>They touch their nose often.

  "<p>It came as no surprise to hear that 72 per cent of people in the UK, according to The Observer poll, have never slept with someone of a different colour; probably because I'm one of them. </p> <p>I've only had two sexual partners, which is rare for a 27-year-old, especially one working in the media industry. Like me, both guys, including my current boyfriend, are black Londoners.</p> <p>I've always had a preference for black men. Growing up in a house with my father and three older brothers probably did the trick. But while this inclination suits me, I never expect the same of other people.</p> <p>Two of my brothers are in mixed-race relationships. One has a white girlfriend, who is due to give birth to a boy next month, and the other has an Indian wife, who is expecting their first child next spring. </p> <p>Whenever I meet my siblings' new partners, the first things I study are their personalities and behaviour. Protecting my brothers from bunny-boilers is far more important than skin colour.</p> <p>It doesn't surprise me that many people, according to the poll, would consider having sex with someone of another shade. Desire often takes precedence over prejudice. Maybe the delay is down to the fact that they haven't met the right people yet.</p> <p>In my experience, most people who advocate same-race relationships would still sleep with someone from outside of their race. </p> <p>A close friend of mine - an attractive 35-year-old single, black woman - refuses to date outside her race. She's prepared to travel as far as the Caribbean or America to find her Mr Right, and she fears that European and Asian women are, as she puts it, 'taking our men away'. Nevertheless, she also admits to fantasising about having a one-night stand with the Swedish footballer Freddie Ljungberg. </p> <p>Our environment has a huge influence over who we become attracted to. Britain is one of the world's greatest cultural melting pots. With so many different races, colours, religions and ethnicities to choose from, it's inevitable that some of us will cross cultures and break family traditions when it comes to dating, sex or marriage. </p> <p>Another friend is the daughter of a former British National Party member. When we were at school she was too petrified to date black guys. However, she slept with 'a handful' after her father left the BNP some years later. She eventually settled down with a white partner, while her younger sister had a child with an African immigrant in 2003. </p> <p>An eccentric, but lovable, black girl I've known for 20 years has slept with a diverse range of partners, including a mixed-race hip-hop head, an African-American basketball player, an Albanian builder, and an English West Ham fan, who is the father of her four-year-old daughter. In contrast, the majority of the Muslim girls I went to school with are married to Muslim men. Most of my Bangladeshi, Pakistani and Indian peers were never allowed out after school. </p> <p>Looking back, if my parents had given me the same treatment as that received by my Muslim peers, I probably wouldn't have kissed three local white boys (not on the same day of course). </p> <p>My family lived on the Isle of Dogs in the heart of east London for over 30 years, until 2001. It's a close-knit community. Most of my white classmates' parents, grandparents, uncles, aunties, cousins, brothers and sisters all went to school together. Most people from the Isle of Dogs have families that have lived in the area for generations.</p> <p>It's rare for them to marry outside of their community. The majority of the people from my secondary school have had children with each other; and earlier this month, a girl from my science class announced on Facebook that she'd got engaged to James, a boy I used to sit next to in form registration. </p> <p>In the place where I grew up, blacks, Asians and whites are more likely to sleep with each other than with someone from outside the area. Crossing cultures is OK, but dating outside of the borough is a no-no. </p> <p>Generally, blacks, Asians and whites have had more than 50 years to get to know each other. As a result, attitudes towards interracial relationships have changed and having sexual encounters with someone from another race is less of a taboo.</p> <p>According to the results of the poll, men are more inclined to choose a partner from another race. I find this to be true of my male friends. The only guy I know who said he'd never sleep with a white girl, did. And while Muslim girls seemed more inclined to stick to family tradition, some of their male counterparts didn't. </p> <p>Even so, outside of their environment I don't believe there's any real reason why some people are attracted to mixed-race relationships. What is clear, however, is that it matters a lot less now than it did half a century ago.</p> <p>Sexual attraction simply boils down to who you fancy, which is sometimes not determined by colour. And if you prefer to have a partner of the same race, then who really cares? </p> <p>Ultimately, it's up to you to decide who to lie down with. But to those living in the stressful world of Britain, I'd advise you to check out that person's state of mind before worrying about their skin tone. </p> <p>\u2022 Akosua Annobil-Dodoo is the editor of <a href=\"http://www.overgroundonline.com/\">overgroundonline.com</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Sunday October 26 2008.

  "<p>Or perhaps we're more of a salad bowl? Melting pot is always the preferred metaphor for multi-cultural Britain, but just how much 'melting' is going on? How much intermingling? Are we rather a mixture of races, providing an interesting national flavour of separate communities tossed together? Rubbing along, but never really integrating.</p> <p>Historically, the United Kingdom has been tolerant of interracial relations compared with other nations. Not for us the rabid anti-miscegenation laws of Nazi Germany (brought in as part of the Nuremberg Laws in September 1935), South Africa under apartheid (the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act was introduced in 1949 and not repealed until 1985) or the United States. According to the 2001 UK Census, 2% of marriages in Britain today are interracial. Although a small proportion of all marriages, it is worth bearing in mind that the non-white population of the UK is a mere 9% of the total. Put into context, we have a similar percentage of interracial marriages to the US where non-whites account for a far larger proportion of the total population.</p> <p>This difference in trans-Atlantic attitudes is a legacy of centuries of US state laws prohibiting interracial marriages. The first such law was introduced in Virginia in 1691 among the newly wealthly plantation owners and spread to 30 of the then 48 US states between 1913-1948. It wasn't until 1967 that the Supreme Court finally ruled all anti-miscegenation laws unconstitutional in the famous Loving v. Virginia case and ever since the number of interracial marriages in the US has been growing.</p> <p>But underlying this stark difference between Britain and the States is a subtler distinction. The growing number of interracial marriages in the US are largely middle-class with prominent flag bearers Barack Obama and Tiger Woods (both children of interracial unions) at their helm. Over here, meanwhile, marriages between members of different ethnic communities tend towards the working classes: you date and marry within your community, regardless of race.</p> <p>There are also some interesting trends among the sexes. In the UK, according to the 2001 Census, Chinese women are almost twice as likely to marry outside their ethnic group than Chinese men. However, Black Caribbean men are almost 50% more likely to marry someone of a different race (typically white women) than their female counterparts - a fact that mirrors the US experience where commentators have noted a 'marriage squeeze' whereby more 'eligible' African American men marry outside their ethnic group.</p> <p>Although interracial marriage is rapidly losing any social, legal or class stigma, there remain important sticking points where love hasn't, as yet, conquered all.</p>",
  "<p>Many British savers with money tied up in overseas accounts that offer princely returns could be forgiven for casting a wary eye at the banks behind their accounts this weekend.</p> <p>Last week Dutch bank ING, which recently scooped up billions of pounds of savings belonging to those formerly with Icelandic bank Kaupthing Edge, revealed that it been given a staggering \u20ac10bn (\u00a37.9bn) injection from the Netherlands government.</p> <p>The money will be used to shore up its balance sheet and, as ING itself puts it, 'create a strong buffer to navigate the current market and economic environment'.The Dutch government also weighed in to stress that its reinforcement gave ING 'robust financial resilience'.</p> <p>Yet for the tens of thousands of UK savers with the failed Kaupthing Edge who saw their money swept into ING by the British government, there is gnawing uncertainty over how safe their bank is, and what will happen to their high interest rates.</p> <p>The financial crisis has sent ripples of fear through the savings community, and prompted many with money in an overseas bank to wonder if it might not be a better idea to bring it closer to home, despite financial guarantees that are just as robust - if not more generous - than the UK's. The choice for British savers - to choose another overseas bank for new savings, leave existing overseas cash where it is, or pull it out - will depend on their attitude to perceived risk. </p> <p>In an attempt to gauge whether a bank has enough financial muscle to ride out the turbulence, many are choosing to look at a bank's credit rating - the 'badge of health' given to it by a ratings agency such as Standard &amp; Poor's (S&amp;P), Moody's or Fitch. These ratings start with the safest of all - 'AAA' - and work down through varieties of Bs and Cs, to lower ratings that indicate a bank is much less healthy than it could be.</p> <p>'You can check credit ratings, but the average man in the street may not understand them. Obviously a triple-A is the best - but the thing is, they can change very quickly, as we saw with the Icelandic banks,' says Rachel Thrussell at financial analyst Moneyfacts. 'Unless you keep an eye on the credit rating, and do so regularly, it'll be very hard to know where it's at.' </p> <p>You normally have to pay for up-to-date data although research on financial websites can yield a crop of recent ratings. But Martin Lewis, who runs Moneysavingexpert.com, says any attempt to try to pick which bank will be next to fail is 'virtually impossible'. 'The best thing to do is to rely on the protection, not the rumour mill,' he says, and spread your cash around banks operating under separate banking licences. Far better, agrees Thrussell, to check that any overseas bank you save with is registered with its national regulator, and offers you enough protection in the event of collapse.</p> <p>Here we take a closer look at some of the popular overseas banks including their interest rates, stability and compensation schemes. </p> <h2>ING</h2> <p><strong>Rates:</strong><strong> </strong>In July, Kaupthing Edge revamped its offer to give a table-topping 7.15 per cent on a one-year fixed-term deposit account on sums from \u00a31,000, and a meaty 6.5 per cent on its instant access account; for its savers who are now with ING, the future is unlikely to be anywhere near as generous.</p> <p>While ING's easy-access direct savings rate is 6 per cent, it includes a 1.67 per cent bonus that runs out after 12 months, and its fixed-rate savings deal offers 5.5 per cent - but only if you hold a minimum of \u00a35,000. Savers who had less than this in a Kaupthing account face a very uncertain future, with neither reassurances of rates being kept high nor any promise of a swift decision given. 'All the situations are being looked at and are still under review, and ING will duly inform Kaupthing savers,' a spokesman says.</p> <p><strong>Credit rating: </strong>Last week Standard &amp; Poor's gave ING an 'AA' rating. S&amp;P says that rating shows the bank to have 'a very strong capacity to meet its financial commitments'.</p> <p><strong>Compensation:</strong><strong> </strong>Any ING savers concerned about compensation should take comfort from the Dutch deposit guarantee compensation scheme, which guarantees to pay out more than the UK's Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS); it will cover up to \u20ac100,000 (approximately \u00a379,000) - much more than the UK's \u00a350,000.</p> <h2>ICICI</h2> <p><strong>Rates:</strong> On Wednesday the rate on Indian bank ICICI UK's barnstorming 7.2 per cent one-year HiSave Fixed Rate account will be chopped by an as-yet-unspecified amount. Although accounts opened up to and including Wednesday, with at least a \u00a31,000 deposit, will still qualify for its stellar rate, the cut will dim the bank's lustre.</p> <p><strong>Credit rating:</strong><strong> </strong>Recently there was a small panic among ICICI customers after a service fault prevented its online banking service from working. Coming just days after the Icelandic banks' demise, it was enough to prompt a rush of worried calls to customer service lines and force the Indian banking giant to put up a sign on its website reassuring customers that it wasn't in financial trouble. Last week, its Standard &amp; Poor's rating stood at a 'BBB', which S&amp;P says indicates a bank with 'adequate capacity to meet its financial commitments'. But the rating does come with a proviso that 'adverse economic conditions... are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity... to meet its financial commitments'.</p> <p><strong>Compensation:</strong> The first \u00a350,000 is covered by the UK's FSCS; anything above this would depend on the severity of any crash. While the government guaranteed all IceSave savings held by UK savers, there's no guarantee the same would apply if another foreign bank collapsed. </p> <h2>FirstSave</h2> <p><strong>Rates: </strong>FirstSave, whose accounts are provided by FBN Bank (UK) - a wholly-owned subsidiary of First Bank of Nigeria - has now withdrawn its competitive 6.75 per cent deal for a one-year fixed-rate bond; interest paid out on its less competitive Easy Access account has also been pushed down.</p> <p>Peter Hinson, FBN (UK)'s managing director, says a flood of money into its accounts lay behind the decision temporarily to suspend the fixed-rate offer: 'We will accept new money again, but not until some time in November,' he says. The rate, although yet to be set, is unlikely to be as high as before as interest rates around the world ease down.</p> <p><strong>Credit rating: </strong>S&amp;P rates FBN as 'BB', which it says underlines 'ongoing uncertainties and exposure to adverse business, financial or economic conditions which could lead to... inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitments'.</p> <p><strong>Compensation: </strong>The first \u00a350,000 is covered by the FSCS.</p>",
  "<p>When there's a landslide, you can feel the earth shake beneath your feet. And - goodness! - are those Rupert Murdoch's knees I see knocking in the distance?</p> <p>Last week the trickle of American editorial columns revealing their election choice turned to a flood: 105 for Obama versus a paltry 33 for McCain (when Editor and Publisher magazine did its sums). That's already 10 million circulation copies versus 2.5 million. And it gets worse for the Republicans with every passing publication day. The press and the polls chime as one. Hail to commander-in-chief Barack.</p> <p>But what's this big vote - 702,000 copies' worth - going in the other direction? Why, that's Murdoch's New York Post. And don't dare forget Fox News, with its fawning Sarah Palin interviews, rabid comment panels and general curl of a non-liberal lip. The outward and visible Murdoch isn't turning Democrat this time around. Rather, it seems, he's sticking his chin out and putting the boot in to the last.</p> <p>Except that this is also where you hear those knees knocking - or, at least, the sound of an old Aussie thumb getting a terrible sucking. Of course, the mighty empire isn't monolithic to begin with. Murdoch's Post may have endorsed McCain weeks ago, but his Times of London has publicly gone down the Obama track (just as it took a different tack from its Sunday sister last British time around). Come to think of it, didn't Rupert himself go wooing Obama to do Fox interviews in the teeth of growls from the channel's charismatic supremo, Roger Ailes? Isn't 'fair and balanced' the somewhat risible Fox slogan anyway?</p> <p>For there is, looking closer, a sub-text here that instructs on the real nature of the relationship between Citizen Rupe and the political classes. Call it an uneasy stand-off. News Corporation, the mightiest and most opinionated media giant on Earth, couldn't keep its erstwhile hero, George W Bush, aloft in popularity polls. Neither - despite much nudging - could it make Hillary Clinton a nomination winner. The force was with Obama, and no amount of condemnation, questioning or simple propaganda could blow it away. </p> <p>One landslide, moreover, can lead to another. Suppose a walloping Obama victory is paralleled by a similar triumph in Senate and House races. Suppose a new Democratic President is master of all he surveys and, for a time, very popular. Fox will then appear defeated itself, neutered, no longer cock of the TV walk - and there's another grisly threat in waiting.</p> <p>The New York Post itself has one premonition of doom. It carries an opinion piece from a notable right-wing campaigner, Brian Anderson, raising the spectre of a new Fairness Doctrine and eponymous Act. From 1949 until the advent of Ronald Reagan, the old Fairness Act kept radio and TV stations roughly in check. It didn't enforce an impartiality that would have kept the BBC awake at night, but it did guarantee some kind of access and overall balance on the airwaves. Now - backed by favourable summer polls, with 47 per cent in favour and 39 per cent against - it could be on its way back.</p> <p>Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the House, would like mandatory fairness prescribed by law again. Others at her side fancy community boards charged with making sure that the large chain stations put down roots in the cities they dominate. Obama himself is said to favour renewing radio licences every two years, not letting them lie for eight at a time. Perhaps he doesn't favour the whole fairness package, but he surely wouldn't veto it if his Democrats on Capitol Hill went their own ways. Cue unimaginable horror.</p> <p>'A new Fairness Doctrine would drive political talk radio off the dial,' quavers Anderson. 'If a station ran a big-audience conservative programme... it would also have to run a left-leaning alternative'. But, since nobody listen to liberal radio, 'stations would probably have to trim back conservative shows to avoid airing unsuccessful liberal ones'.</p> <p>It may seem a baroque sort of censorship, but it's out there, waiting for an Obama administration - and there's nothing even Murdoch can do about it apart from smile nicely. The larger your corporation, the wider your spread of interests - and the more vulnerable you become. Fairness and balance tests for 'fair and balanced' Fox News? It could be a killer blow. 'We will fight to the end for our ability to put occasionally controversial, offensive and even tasteless content on air,' says Peter Chernin, News Corp's chief operating officer. </p> <p>But don't fight the inevitable, so expect rather more than 100 days of dulcet acquiescence. Expect a benign Wall Street Journal, a muzzled Post and Fox News for once actually doing what its slogan claims. Will that stave off doctrines of right-wing despair? Possibly, for the most part. The 105 Barack endorsees don't love Rush Limbaugh and friends, but they'll be anxious about Washington telling them what to do. There'll be a natural press and TV majority crying 'hands off'. </p> <p>But nobody - least of all Mr M - will be putting the knife in. Keep Roger Ailes in quarantine as balanced threat meets excruciatingly balanced response.</p> <h2>Wapping displays a lack of joined-up thinking over the internet</h2> <p>There are two key races in the newspaper world. One is traditional: that for print copy circulation. The other is rather more mystic: how many unique users drop in to your website? This second battle has two great leaders, the Guardian and the Telegraph</p> <p>In September, the Guardian topped 24 million and the Telegraph hit 22.9 million, record figures clearly boosted by mordant credit crunch checkers (which meant an extra million UK-based visitors - 9.8 million in all to the Guardian site and 7.2 million domestic users for the Telegraph</p> <p>But there's an issue here as well as simple statistics. The two front-runners have ploughed huge money into development and integration, bringing newsrooms and journalist teams together to mount a powerful, constantly updated service. But where's the Times in all this? It's number one for financial readers in print, comfortably beating the FT; yet, in crunch September, it could only finish a relatively distant third with 20.3 million unique users. </p> <p>That was a record, too, but still a pretty non-integrated one. As September ended, the online chief for both the Times and Sunday Times - the feisty Anne Spackman - found herself moved over to run Times comment, to be replaced by two editors, one for the daily, one for the Sunday. </p> <p>A pretty clear signal. The Sunday Times is too rich and grand to want its staff to work around the clock, and the Times also seems to like being alone. But can determined non-integration deliver the goods that working together appears to provide? It would be very odd to find Wapping standing on its dignity and shifting sands at such a crucial time.</p> <h2>Blogging and the Beast</h2> <p>So it's farewell lone blogger, the big battalions have got you. Or so Paul Boutin finds in the latest edition of Wired. 'Scroll down Technorati's list of the top 100 blogs and you'll find personal sites have been shoved side by professional ones. Most are essentially online magazines ... and a stand-alone commentator can't keep up with a team of pro writers cranking out up to 30 posts a day'.</p> <p>Enter, pat on cue, Tina Brown and <a href=\"http://www.Thedailybeast.com\">Thedailybeast.com</a>, which is so much like a magazine that it cost a reported $18m to launch. Can online possibly sustain an investment like that? Ah! hello again, lone blogger ... at least you're cheap.</p> <h2>A change in weather for public service</h2> <p>Huge tomes are constructed these days trying to define public-service journalism, but here's a two-minute test (courtesy of Mikhail Gorbachev's World Political Forum and a recent conference of editors and climate-change editors from all over the globe).</p> <p>'Because investigative reporting is time and resource consuming, news organisations should make an ethical and financial commitment to reporting climate change. We understand that making such a financial commitment is a challenge ... but we should make a fundamental change from the current situation, where too few news organisations have reporters who understand science and how it works.'</p> <p>Simple question for the editor, then? Who's covering global warming for you, and what credentials does he or she have? That's public service.</p> <h2>Playing dumb</h2> <p>What does a union general secretary do when he's got members on both sides of a dispute? He plays dumb, or 'slightly bemused'. That's Jeremy Dear of the National Union of Journalists, implicitly siding with his BBC members rather than his regional press membership in the row over local Beeb ultra-local internet sites. Can't see the problem, says Jeremy. The BBC doesn't take ads, does it?</p> <p>No, but it takes readers away from the local papers whose newsrooms supply much of BBC content. And when readers go, ads go. Surely Mr Dear can see the problem? If he can't, then his members on both sides have a problem, too.</p>",
  "<p>The Taliban called it the 'mouth of hell', the tiny British fort in southern <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/afghanistan\">Afghanistan</a> they relentlessly attacked throughout the summer. Today, the last paratroopers who defended its remote ramparts <a href=\"http://www.guardaian.co.uk/uk/military\">return home</a> but, as ever with war, the cost has been great. Of the 160 men who manned Forward Operating Base Gibraltar, almost one in three was killed or wounded, a higher casualty rate than that suffered by British soldiers during the Second World War.</p> <p>Indeed, Gibraltar was so treacherous that its occupants faced a similar likelihood of being killed or injured as those who fought on the bloody battlefields of the First World War.</p> <p>Now the men are back in Britain after a period of fighting during which their battle group - 2 Para - sustained the highest number of deaths on a single six-month tour in Afghanistan or Iraq. Those who survived told yesterday of chasing Taliban fighters through shoulder-high cornfields, shooting men from punching range and pulling the bodies of comrades through streams with banks ablaze from rocket-propelled grenades. </p> <p>Gibraltar was arguably the most vulnerable and dangerous British base in Helmand province. The men of C Company, who manned its fortifications, were on average 23 years old. Five of its occupants died in action, 14 were seriously injured and another 30 wounded.</p> <p>The stories told by the survivors are brutal. Theirs is not a tale of technological might against a primitive foe, rather an insight into war seemingly unchanged throughout the centuries, a gruelling campaign involving daily skirmishes against a redoubtable enemy.</p> <p>There are moments when men such as Corporal Matthew 'Des' Desmond, 31, pulled out his pistol and shot a Taliban gunman from two metres. 'There is no emotional attachment, you'd feel more anguish shooting a bunny rabbit,' he smiled ruefully, hours after arriving at his Colchester barracks. </p> <p>Stories from the men of C company provide a snapshot of Helmand's unique hazards. They tell how children ushered British soldiers into deadly ambushes, how troops were targeted the instant they crept out from Gibraltar's front gates and how the Taliban planted rings of hidden explosives around the base. In the space of four months Gibraltar was attacked 36 times. In addition, its defenders became embroiled in 29 firefights while on another 22 instances they were either targeted or stumbled across explosive booby traps laid out for them. </p> <p>'We never stood down,' said Desmond, a father-of-three. 'We would always push on to them, even chasing them through their own ambushes,' </p> <p>By the end, at least 150 Taliban were confirmed dead around their small base. Long before then, however, the Taliban had started referring to the paras' home as the 'mouth of hell' or 'devil's place'.</p> <p>For the first two months of the tour barely a shot was fired in anger. Then, on 8 June, news filtered up the Helmand valley that three men from 2 Para had been killed when a suicide bomber walked up to them and detonated his vest. The following day a suicide bomber mounted an attack on Gibraltar. The day after that a patrol came under fire. Another suicide mission was launched hours later.</p> <p>The morning of 12 June defines the moment C company would first experience the horrors of Helmand. Several platoons had spent the night under the stars beyond enemy lines and were heading back when they stopped at a village. As usual, they dished out sweets and wind-up radios to the children, but this time the youngsters seemed preoccupied with what lay beyond a track winding towards a stream. 'They were laughing and pointing. In hindsight, it's strange they would find it so amusing,' said Desmond.</p> <p>As the paras went to investigate, four Taliban sections opened up simultaneously. 'The weight of fire was incredible, their weapons were rocking and rolling without stopping. In 13 years in the army that was the best initiated ambush I've come across,' Desmond went on. </p> <p>The paras returned 9,000 machine gun and automatic rifle rounds plus 179 mortar shells. Then came the cry 'man down'. Amid the din, it came again. In the initial chaos, Private Jeff Doherty, 20, and James Bateman, 29, had been killed instantly. Another soldier collapsed, shot in the leg, while a machine gunner took a bullet in the face. Miraculously the projectile glanced off his chin; colleagues scraped the blood from his face and the gunner got back to work. </p> <p>The fight lasted 18 minutes. 'But time stops during such moments. Fighting is like a waltz, quick, quick, slow slow,' said Desmond. Back at Gibraltar, the mood was sombre but resolute. Five men from 2 Para had been killed in four days. </p> <p>At dawn next day C Company went on patrol. Through intercepted communications they heard the Taliban exclaim their disbelief at the paras' refusal to be cowed. Desmond said: 'From that point on, every time we saw them we would smash them. They would choose the ground and we would beat them. Every time.' </p> <p>Captain Josh Jones, 32, from London, who briefly left Helmand for the birth of his daughter Isabella, now eight weeks old, said: 'We never relied on air cover, we always fought them head on.'</p> <p>But one facet that could not be altered was Gibraltar's reputation as the most exposed of Helmand's bases. Easy to attack, it was hard to defend. Troops who ventured outside were often shot from snipers. As the conflict intensified, conditions deteriorated. On one occasion the ground temperature taken by a sniper read 78C.</p> <p>Desmond's desert boots melted. Forced to lug packs weighing 90lbs, many of C Coy cursed the clunky body armour designed to save their lives. As summer gave way to autumn, the enemy amended its tactics. Chechens, Uzbeks and trained Pakistani fighters began to lay siege to Gibraltar. Corporal Paul Knapp, 26, from Bristol said: 'You can tell immediately they are different, the way they move, the way they fight.'</p> <p>Knapp also travelled back from Afghanistan for the birth of his son, Colburn, seven weeks old yesterday. His wife, Chanelle, 24, said: 'It was really hard before the tour because you don't know what to expect. It's just good to have him back.'</p> <p>Now home with their families, the readjustment starts. Desmond admits to being a bit 'jumpy' in downtown Colchester. Knapp jokes about the cacophony of bonfire night jangling the nerves. 'When we started, we all knew we would not be coming back with all the guys,' said Jones. On Thursday the 13 men from the 2 Para battle group who died this summer will be remembered at a ceremony in Colchester. Yet a return to Helmand already looms C Company are pencilled in for southern Afghanistan in 2010.</p>",
  "<p>In one of the most extraordinary episodes in African legal history, a panel of judges from Senegal, Mali and Togo will tomorrow issue a verdict expected to give fresh hope to more than 40,000 people being held as slaves in rural Niger and across the region.</p> <p>The landmark case of Hadijatou Mani, a courageous young woman of 24, will be heard in a packed court in Niger's capital, Niamey, which will decide whether Niger's government has failed to protect Ms Mani and tens of thousands like her who have been enslaved, despite the practice being outlawed five years ago.</p> <p>If she wins her case, which is being heard by the justice arm of the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas), she is likely to be awarded compensation of up to \u00a340,000, in a humiliating reversal for the authorities she blames for her lost youth.</p> <p>Ms Mani was sold into slavery at the age of 12 and repeatedly raped by her master. Her appalling story is familiar in a country where the ownership of slaves, many from a hereditary slave caste, has been commonplace, particularly in remote rural areas.</p> <p>Speaking before the judgment, Ms Mani said: 'It was very difficult to challenge my former master and to speak out when people see you as nothing more than a slave. But I knew that this was the only way to protect my child from suffering the same fate. Nobody deserves to be enslaved.</p> <p>'We are all equal and deserve to be treated the same as anyone else. I hope that all those who are in slavery today can find their freedom. No woman should suffer the way I did.'</p> <p>Helen Duffy, a lawyer who has represented Ms Mani, said: 'I'm really optimistic. It is such a clear case. She has suffered so much. It is just the clearest violation.'</p> <p>The life of a sadaka - sexual slave - has been described in detail by Ms Mani in the court, in front of some of the country's most senior political figures. Speaking nervously at first, she told the court how she had been born a slave, been sold and transferred as a child against her mother's wishes to a man named El Hadj Souleymane Naroua. She testified that she had been raped at 13 and constantly forced to have sex with her 63-year-old master, who owned seven other slaves.</p> <p>Beatings were frequent and she and other slaves were forced to work unpaid and gruelling hours for Naroua and his four legitimate wives. When she tried to escape, she was punished.</p> <p>In 2005, two years after Niger enacted a law forbidding slavery, she was presented with a 'liberation certificate'. This proved to be worthless, as she was immediately forced into a 'wahiya marriage', with the status of a concubine. When she fled and married another man, her master had her arrested and charged with bigamy. She was subsequently imprisoned for two months on remand. It is believed that if tomorrow's verdict goes in her favour, the bigamy charges will be dropped.</p> <p>'You could see her grow in stature through her testimony,' said Duffy. 'When she was done we left the courtroom and, for the first time, I saw her smile; an enormous, satisfied smile. She was justifiably very proud of herself.'</p> <p>The issue has become a deeply embarrassing one for the government of Niger. Despite introducing the anti-slavery legislation, it has failed to act on evidence of its continuing and widespread existence in rural areas.</p> <p>One Nigerien official told the UN committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women in 2007 that he could prove that 'slavery does not exist in Niger'.</p> <p>As well as being banned under Nigerien law, slavery is outlawed under many of the international agreements Niger has signed up to, including the UN Slavery Convention of 1926 and the African Charter on Human and People's Rights.</p> <p>But international conventions and national laws count for little compared to the centuries old 'customary law' that holds sway in rural villages and towns. According to Anti-Slavery International, Niger's courts have frequently proved reluctant to enforce law over custom. In one case in 2006, both the sentence and fine against one slave owner, Seidimou Hiya, were massively reduced.</p> <p>The case of a 15-year-old girl who sought help from Timidria, a Nigerien anti-slavery group, after fleeing her slave master, was thrown out after the local prosecutor ruled that she was a 'disobedient girl'.</p> <p>Ms Mani's case against the government rests on witness testimony, including that relating to her sale to Naroua. The government's witnesses, tribal chiefs, have claimed not to understand the terms of enslavement, then changed their evidence twice.</p> <p>'We are hoping for a strong message on this,' said Romana Cacchioli, Africa programme officer of Anti-Slavery International, which worked with Timidria to bring the case. 'It would send out a clear message that the longstanding prohibition of slavery must be enforced.</p> <p>'Although it's all well and good that states ratify human rights conventions, we need them to ensure effective implementation. We hope the court will recommend the state trains its judicial staff and raises the issue of slavery through a national publicity campaign. It is not the state of Niger which is perpetrating slavery, it is individuals, but the state has a responsibility.</p> <p>'Hadijatou is really impressive. She comes across as very unassuming. She knows she has been wronged. She was in court with her baby strapped on her back. She says she does not want the same thing that happened to her to happen to her daughter. Her vision is in terms of others.'</p> <p>Campaigners hope a favourable ruling may herald a major cultural shift on the issue of descent-based slavery throughout the Sahel region. The court's judgment will be binding in Niger and will be applicable in other countries in the Ecowas community where descent-based slavery exists, including Mali.</p>",
  "<p>It is a familiar, agonising story. A star footballer is carried off the pitch on a stretcher after rupturing a knee. The diagnosis is a tear to the anterior cruciate ligament. The player is devastated: this injury can require a year or more of rehab, and leaves no guarantee that they will ever be as good again. </p> <p>It happened to Paul Gascoigne, playing for Tottenham in the 1991 FA Cup final. He didn't feature in another game for 16 months. Michael Owen was out for 10 months after he tore the ligament with England at the 2006 World Cup. Ruud van Nistelrooy, Lawrence Dallaglio and most recently Tiger Woods have all suffered the same injury. </p> <p>But it is not male stars that sports doctors are now most worried about. It is sportswomen. They are currently considered to be up to eight times more likely to suffer anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) damage than men, and in the United States so many women and girls have been affected that one expert has called it an epidemic. The problem has been highlighted from the morning news bulletin on ABC to the front page of the New York Times as thousands of women and girls in competitive sport undergo ACL operations each year, at a cost of millions of dollars. The higher the level of competition, the more they are at risk. One in 10 women playing college sports will suffer an ACL injury.</p> <p>Why the concern? Partly because we know so little about how men and women are susceptible to particular injuries, especially about the neuromuscular differences between the sexes. Research is still being carried out into rates of concussion, thought to be higher in women, joint injuries and even bone damage in endurance athletes leading to stress fractures of the femur, such as the one Paula Radcliffe suffered before the Beijing Olympics.</p> <p>'There are certain areas where you would say women appear to be at a greater risk,' says OSM columnist Dr Nicholas Peirce, a lead physician at the English Institute of Sport. 'We don't know how increased activity is affecting hips, backs and shoulders. We see a large number of women having shoulder operations in canoeing and rugby, and there are other injuries, stress fractures of the back or stress lumbars on the lower spine. We are challenged to really follow and observe the demands of elite sport because at the moment there is a lot we don't know.'</p> <p>The most evident problems just now are with the anterior cruciate ligament, because it is such a devastating injury. Ruled out of action for sometimes more than a year, athletes fall behind in their sporting careers, are 25 per cent more likely to suffer the same injury again and, worst of all, face debilitating permanent damage to their knees. Women in their twenties are being described as 'crippled', even after successful ACL surgery, as osteoarthritis of the knee takes hold.</p> <p>Football is the most common source of the injury, but every sport that involves landing from a jump or changing direction at speed puts women and girls at risk - which includes netball, basketball, volleyball, hockey, rugby, handball, skiing and snowboarding. In Norway, the reigning Olympic champions at women's handball, 12 out of 28 players from an elite club team suffered ACL injuries. When several members of the country's Olympic team tore their ACLs, the King of Norway donated funds to help research into the problem.</p> <p>In the US, downhill skiing has one of the highest injury rates for females. 'A few years back you could not get to World Cup level without having had an ACL tear by the peak of your career,' says Dr Cara Walther, a former skier turned orthopaedic surgeon. 'It was almost 100 per cent of the girls on the ski team. And I'm one of the statistics. Back in the 1980s I tore both my ACLs.'</p> <p>The International Olympic Committee (IOC) are so concerned by the statistics coming out of the United States, Sweden, Norway and Germany that this year they invited a panel of experts to report on ACL injuries. Their recommendations included building better injury-prevention techniques into training.</p> <p>In the UK, reactions have been muted. While we bask in the glory of this year's Olympic success, government and sports bodies are targeting girls and women, hoping to increase their sporting activity. But are they also risking women's health, by ignoring the injury issue? Britain has no comprehensive collection of sports-injury data, no researchers in the field, and no public messages about injury risk or prevention. 'I'm afraid we are a bit behind here,' Peirce admits. 'In this country, organisation of women's sport is really quite low-brow. In sports medicine we're aware of the issues but it's not made it hugely into the national arena or even the subculture of sport.'</p> <p>One of the biggest factors is the low profile of women's sport in the UK. While in the US, Scandinavia and Germany women's sport attracts decent crowds and TV audiences, in the UK we are still struggling to generate interest and encourage participation. While those remain the key goals, campaigners for gender equality in sport are unlikely to point out that women and girls may be more prone to injury than men and boys. </p> <p>In the US, where gender politics in sport has been a major force for more than 30 years, the injury debate has been fierce. American sportswriter Michael Sokolove's book, Warrior Girls: Protecting Our Daughters Against the Injury Epidemic in Women's Sports, sparked huge controversy this year. His claims were nothing new to sports scientists, but the emotive language terrified the 'soccer moms' and turned ACL tears into a political issue.</p> <p>Ever since the US introduced Title IX in 1972, a federal law that barred gender discrimination in public education, the number of women aged 14 and upwards taking part in sport in high schools has increased tenfold to three million, constituting one in three of the age group. But with Title IX remaining a source of dispute - some claim that it deprives men of sporting opportunities - those working in sports equality, such as the Women's Sports Foundation, found ACL injuries an issue easier to avoid. Sokolove criticised the foundation for refusing to acknowledge the problem. When OSM contacted the UK's own Women's Sports and Fitness Foundation, it too refused to comment. </p> <p>Dr Tim Hewett at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine has been researching the issue for nearly 20 years and is used to the opposition. Hewett, who specialises in biophysics, began researching the high numbers of ACL injuries in women and girls after his sister Jenny tore her ACL playing basketball in the 1960s; decades later she still suffers from a swollen, unstable and osteoarthritic knee. </p> <p>'When I started pushing this agenda in the late 1980s I got a lot of resistance. It puzzled me at first until I thought about the politics of it. The last thing people want to say is that women are unequal to men, or that we need to make women's bodies behave more like men's. We are telling girls to \"bend it like Beckham\" but their bodies are not built like Beckham's. I don't want to turn girls into boys, I just want to make them as prepared to play sport as they can be. The implications may not be politically correct. But they are a reality.'</p> <p>Invited to share his research all over the world, Hewett says one of the few countries he has not been asked to visit is Britain. He puts it down to the position of women's sports in this country and others like it. 'I was invited to speak at Athletic Bilbao in Spain, another country where men's sports dominate, and their immediate reaction was, \"Yeah, this is all fine, but what about the men?\"</p> <p>'How do you get this information across in a situation where women's sports are not as popular? It's a money and prestige thing, but this is a major health-disparity issue. We have to even up the playing field.'</p> <p>There are also differences between US and British sporting cultures to consider. Many agree that in the US over-competitiveness and over-playing contribute to injury.</p> <p>The problem of ACL tears is simple to address. Prevention programmes are easily incorporated into warm-up and cool-down sessions and can reduce injuries by up to 70 per cent, cutting the odds to the same level as those faced by boys and men. 'The biggest issue we face now,' Hewett says, 'is getting the information out to the public. We can do all the research in the world, but if we don't get the word out to coaches, parents and players, the interventions will be of no use.'</p> <p>It is generally believed that alignment of the knee is a major indicator of an at-risk athlete. If the knee falls inward when bending, running or jumping - as is often the case in female athletes - the ACL is more likely to rupture. Girls can be screened for these neuromuscular habits from a young age.</p> <p>The problem is educating coaches, who are often more geared to performance than injury prevention, to spot the trend. Former world triple jump record holder Ashia Hansen says her knee-alignment problems went undetected by coaches and physios throughout her career. It was only her last coach, Aston Moore, who identified the habit, but by then she had already suffered a ruptured patella, in 2004. She never fully recovered and had to retire through injury before Beijing, aged 36.</p> <p>Hewett says that Hansen is the kind of athlete who could have been immediately identified as being at risk. 'A triple-jumper puts significant stress on their knees. The muscles around the knee are not designed to absorb high forces when the knee is collapsing inwards. Quite likely if someone had worked on her biomechanics and taught her to control that knee joint, I'm near certain that could have made a difference. Not much research has been done on track-and-field injuries and gender differences, but certainly anterior knee pain is higher in female track athletes than male.'</p> <p>Despite her long career and keen interest, this is information that Hansen had never encountered. She has been told she has long ligaments, she has been told she has had bad luck. 'I have footage from years back where you could see I'd take off and my knee would go inward, so I found shortcuts to compensate. That's not good when you're jumping, there's 10 to 15 times your body weight going through your knee, and you want everything in a straight line otherwise the force is going through the weakest part of your knee.'</p> <p>At the elite level of English women's football, there is at least some understanding of the issue. The links and friendships between players here and in America have meant that news and commiserations on ACL injuries are frequently circulated via Facebook and email. </p> <p>England and Arsenal defender Faye White has had two ACL operations, one on each knee. Each took her out of action for a season at a time. She casually reels off a list of other victims. 'You've only got to look around the Arsenal team bus to spot them. Kelly Smith, Emma Byrne, Yvonne Tracy, Eartha Pond - it is common in the women's game. Over in America Shannon Boxx did hers the same time I did my second one, and Aly Wagner's done both.</p> <p>'I remember the physios telling me there are studies saying women are more susceptible. My biomechanics make me more at risk because I'm a bit bowlegged - we laugh that I look like I've been riding a horse my whole life. But with my knees going outwards laterally it's more likely to cause strain.'</p> <p>White believes that external factors are just as significant in increasing the risk of injury. 'Girls are putting themselves through a lot, trying to do the training but not being able to do the recovery time because we have to balance playing football with jobs. Where professional footballers have rest and recovery I used to leave my house at 6am and get home at 10pm most nights. I was on the go the whole time.' Non-specialist physios are also a problem in the women's game, with injuries that need scans often going unchecked for weeks.</p> <p>Strength and conditioning programmes have helped White, and the England team doctor, Pippa Bennett, believes increased preventative measures in the under-15s through to the senior side are bringing the casualties down. 'You've only got to look at the results of our agility tests to see the improvements,' Dr Bennett says. 'We did that test on the senior team five years ago and we were concerned by the movement patterns being at risk with quite a few of them, but with the strength and conditioning that's all changed. They are fitter for their sport, they learn about the alignment of knee joints and how to move safely.</p> <p>'It's all about learning movements early, and as girls go through puberty remembering to do decent warm-ups and cool-downs. Just keeping the knee over the second toe, keeping your knees in alignment and soft landings on your jumps. That could make all the difference.'</p> <p>And as Bennett points out, the injury risks are not all one way. 'The last Uefa study on injury suggested that women suffer fewer breaks than the guys - we don't do \"the Eduardo\", we just get a nasty bruise. In the bigger picture we just need to encourage girls to play sport: there's a big drop-off of girls exercising and playing sport and scaremongering about injuries does not help.'</p> <p>Ultimately, all the evidence shows us that sport and exercise is as beneficial for women as it is for men. Sport improves health and self-esteem, and helps tackle social problems. There is always a risk of injury, especially at the elite level, but good coaching that includes strength and conditioning, as well as injury work, brings the odds right down. With 2012 keeping sport on the public agenda for the next four years, and the government pushing increased participation for all, now is a good time to start spreading the whole message.</p> <p><strong>Joint injuries</strong></p> <p>After puberty, men's muscles gain power but women's become more flexible. Without sufficient muscle to stabilise them, joints can be at risk</p> <p><strong>Hips, back and shoulders</strong></p> <p>Little is known about the effects on these body areas, although shoulder injuries appear to be common in women playing rugby</p> <p><strong>Concussion</strong></p> <p>Research indicates concussion is caused more easily in girls and young women, perhaps because they have smaller heads and weaker necks</p> <p><strong>Femur fracture</strong></p> <p>As suffered by Paula Radcliffe before the Beijing Olympics. It is suspected that such injuries are more common in female endurance athletes<br><strong><br>Anterior cruciate ligament</strong></p> <p>Women have up to eight times greater risk of ACL damage than men and those affected are 25 per cent more likely to repeat the injury</p> <h2>There are several factors that put girls and women at more risk of non-contact ACL injuries:</h2> <p><strong>Adolescence </strong>After puberty, risk increases by between two and eight times. While men's muscles gain power, women's become more flexible - this is dangerous without sufficient muscle to keep joints stable. </p> <p><strong>Ligament dominance</strong> Without strong muscle development, women compensate using ligaments to absorb force on the knee.</p> <p><strong>Quadricep dominance</strong> Men tend to use hamstrings to stabilise the knee joint: the muscle pulls the tibia back and takes the stress off the ACL. But women rely on their quads, compressing the joint, pulling the tibia forward as the ACL attempts to hold it back, thereby causing stress. </p> <p><strong>Biomechanics</strong> Women's knees tend to fall inward on landing, bending, jumping and pivoting, so ground force is unevenly distributed.</p> <p><strong>Anatomical</strong> Women tend to land more straight-legged than men. </p> <p><strong>Asymmetry</strong> Everyone has a favourite leg, but women tend to be even more asymmetrical than men, with one leg stronger than the other leading to imbalance. </p> <p><strong>Hormonal</strong> Reports show an increased risk during the menstrual cycle, although scientists still don't know why. </p> <p><strong>Psychological</strong> Some say that women have a higher pain threshold than men, and also that they are reluctant to let the team down, playing on through injury and further endangering themselves.</p>",
  "<p>Football matches imprint themselves upon the memory for a variety of reasons. Contrary to what one may imagine, it is rarely for the quality of play. The connoisseur, drawn back to classics, is often disappointed by how play has moved on: great players of the past now look slow-witted.</p> <p>One match, however, when returned to, proves to be of an astonishing quality: the second semi-final of the 1982 World Cup, between West Germany and France. Michel Platini was the French captain that night and has said: 'That was my most beautiful game. What happened in those two hours encapsulated all the sentiments of life itself. No film or play could ever recapture so many contradictions and emotions. It was complete. So strong. It was fabulous.'</p> <p>West Germany's presence in the semis was not widely welcomed. In their opening group game, Algeria, 1,000-1 outsiders to win the competition, had beaten the European champions 2-1. After Algeria defeated Chile in their final group game, Austria and West Germany met a day later knowing that if the Germans won by either one or two goals they would both go through. </p> <p>The first 10 minutes were played at a furious pace until the deadlock was broken by a Horst Hrubesch goal for the Germans. Thereafter, for the remaining 80 minutes, both teams strolled around the pitch, passing the ball sideways and backwards. There was not a single meaningful shot on goal. The outraged, largely Spanish crowd yelled 'Fuera, fuera' ('Out, out'). Algerian supporters waved banknotes at the players. One West German fan burned his national flag in protest.</p> <p>The West German camp failed to appreciate what all the fuss was about. Coach Jupp Derwall said: 'We wanted to progress, not play football.' When fans gathered in front of the squad hotel, demanding the players justify themselves, members of the team threw water-filled balloons on their own supporters from the windows of their rooms. </p> <p>Their semi-final was at the Estadio Ram\u00f3n S\u00e1nchez Pizju\u00e1n, on 8 July 1982. Kick-off was 9pm but it was a muggy night in Seville, with the temperature in the high nineties. France had a day fewer to recover from their last group match, but this handicap had been balanced by nature, a stomach bug affecting their opponents. The F\u00f6rster brothers and striker Klaus Fischer were among those affected.</p> <p>Michel Platini and the bearded Manny Kaltz, standing in as captain for Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, who was on the bench with a damaged hamstring, shook hands with the officials: Dutch referee Charles Corver and his linesmen, Swiss Bruno Galler and Scot Robert Valentine. The captains tossed a coin, swapped pennants. There was a noisy, carnivalesque atmosphere. </p> <p>During the early stages Germany were in charge. Paul Breitner, the only survivor of West Germany's 1974 World Cup-winning side, had retired from the national team but been persuaded back by Derwall: playing now not at full-back but in central midfield, Breitner had become his team's marshal. He would set off on diagonal runs, driving into space in French territory, spearing passes for his colleagues to run on to. A sense of purpose coursed through German moves. </p> <p>In the 17th minute Breitner cadged the ball off midfield grafter Wolfgang Dremmler just inside the France half and, seeing space ahead of him, burst into it, brushing off Didier Six's feeble challenge. Breitner headed towards the middle then, faced by a wall of blue, veered off towards the left before stabbing the ball with the outside of his right foot perfectly into the path of Klaus Fischer. Jean-Luc Ettori rushed out from his goal and dived at Fischer's feet: he blocked the run but failed to gather the ball, which rolled slowly back out towards the edge of the penalty area. It was teed up nicely for young Pierre Littbarski, West Germany's find of the tournament, who drilled it through a litter of French bodies and into the net.</p> <p><strong>One-nil.</strong></p> <p>Where the West Germany players seemed to have settled to a similar tempo, the same speed of thought and movement, the French were more moody. Marius Tr\u00e9sor and Bernard Janvion in the middle of the defence and Maxime Bossis on the right all had their socks rolled down, Bossis with his shin-pads flapping out, as if to flaunt their insouciance. Up front the team were light and lop-sided. Dominique Rocheteau had made his name as a pacy right-winger at Saint-Etienne. He was dark and handsome, with the flowing ringlets of a musketeer; fans of Les Verts called Rocheteau 'The Green Angel', although his looks belied both his work-rate and, rare for a footballer, his political awareness: known for his left-wing views and association with the Revolutionary Communist League, today Rocheteau is head of the National Commission of Ethics of the French Football Association.</p> <p>Playing as a lone striker, however, was too great a burden, especially as he received little help from Six - a winger with corkscrew hair, an ornamental player out on the left who occasionally drifted inside to scant purpose.</p> <p>If the France forwards suffered in comparison with those behind them, it could be said that so would anyone. The midfield was led by Platini, described by one journalist as 'the lead violin in a sophisticated string quartet'. Patrolling the ground between centre circle and opposition penalty area, Platini was invariably in the right place to receive a pass and did so alone, when one might have expected an opponent to be beside him. He then became the still centre of a hurtling world, aware of all that could happen. For a moment it was as if the other players became satellites of his calm mind. He would make a pass into inexplicable space, which it would take a second or two for the game to catch up with: Bossis or Jean Tigana ran on to the ball, and only then could everyone see how exquisite the pass was.</p> <p>The rest of the quartet was not bad. Alain Giresse, just 5ft 4in, had a good engine and a lovely cushioned touch with his right boot. Tigana, a team-mate of Giresse at Bordeaux, had not become a professional until his early twenties, spotted as an amateur while working as a postman. Though slight, and elegant, Tigana was a powerful runner with the ball. He also had a markedly slow heartbeat and tremendous stamina.</p> <p>The fourth member was Bernard Genghini, a leggy left-footer as elegant as, if a little less effective than, his colleagues. 'Four artists,' as Brian Glanville puts it in The History of the World Cup, 'no real hard man, no tackler, among them.'</p> <p>Having scored their goal, there was no let-up in West Germany's attacking momentum. But France, too, began to string passes together. Tr\u00e9sor drove forward in a manner rarely seen from stoppers today. Full-back Manny Kaltz caught Genghini after the ball had gone. Genghini bit him back, but France had the free-kick, midway between centre circle and penalty area on the left-hand side. Giresse floated the ball with the outside of his right foot into the right-hand side of the area. Platini outjumped Dremmler to head the ball towards the six-yard line, where Berndt F\u00f6rster made his clearing volley easier by wrestling Rocheteau out of the way with an arm around his waist. Corver had no hesitation in blowing his whistle and pointing to the penalty spot.</p> <p>Platini kissed the ball before placing it on the spot, and walking backwards. On the goalline, chewing gum, gloved hands on hips, Harald Schumacher glared at the ball, at Platini, at the effrontery of a penalty awarded against West Germany. Platini kept walking back. For a moment it looked like he might forget to stop walking. He reached the edge of the penalty area, and still kept going. Was he intimidated by Schumacher's cold-eyed gaze? Still he kept retreating, right through the arc outside the penalty area. Finally Platini stopped, began walking, then jogging, back. Schumacher flung himself to his left. Platini struck the ball with the flat of his right foot, sending it just inside the opposite post. </p> <p><strong>One-all, after 27 minutes.</strong></p> <p>West Germany resumed possession. The game was rougher 25 years ago than it is today. The France left-back Manuel Amoros had got away with hacks at Littbarski; now Tigana, scuttling with the ball out of defence after a West German attack had been repelled, was brutally taken out by Dremmler in a way that now would earn an instant yellow card, at least.</p> <p>Tr\u00e9sor made another irruption into the West German half, passing the ball, continuing his run towards the left-hand corner flag, receiving the return pass, laying the ball back to Amoros, who crossed. Six flicked it on ineffectually, too far from Platini, too close to the goalkeeper. Schumacher contrived not only to gather the ball unimpeded but to keep moving and thump Platini's thigh with his shoulder. Platini, wincing, complained. It was an act of petty aggression for which Schumacher knew he would receive no punishment - he had the ball in his hands, no referee would have given a penalty - but it was a taste of what was to come.</p> <p>The second half was barely under way when Rocheteau received the ball in an unthreatening position out on the right, facing his own goal, whereupon Berndt F\u00f6rster, running up behind him, jumped and somehow kneed Rocheteau in the shoulder. It was an imbecilic assault, for which F\u00f6rster was fortunate to receive only a yellow card. </p> <p>Genghini had taken a knock and, unable to run it off, was replaced. As Patrick Battiston ran on to the pitch a West German cross from the right drifted all the way over to Bossis, who controlled the ball, dummied first to pass it back, then to hoof it upfield, only to waltz around Felix Magath and Fischer before releasing the ball to Tigana on the right. Tigana slipped it inside to Battiston, who played a one-two with Giresse then sped forward, fresh legs devouring ground, before blasting a left-footed shot narrowly wide.</p> <p>The most striking impression, watching the match at a distance of more than 25 years, is of a less disciplined yet more intelligent game than is played today. Every outfield player appears to have had greater autonomy. Both teams passed and moved with thoughtful fluidity; they bristled with intelligent purpose.</p> <p>West Germany continued their pressing game. Midfielder Magath was like a little eel, slipping into pockets of space. Breitner played his sharp passes, probing for a way through the ribs of the French defence. But the defence stood firm. </p> <p>France began to take the upper hand. A Platini free-kick 10 yards outside the West German area cannoned off the wall. Giresse floated a lovely pass from just inside his own half, out on the left. On the edge of the penalty area, Rocheteau seemed to judge the flight of the ball better than Berndt F\u00f6rster: it drifted beyond the German, bounced once, and Rocheteau scuffed it past the onrushing Schumacher. But the referee had blown, deciding Rocheteau had impeded F\u00f6rster.</p> <p>Then Platini cut in from the left, dribbling past Kaltz across the face of the area, feinting past Uli Stielike, but shooting wide. The ball was swallowed by the sea of French fans. Many waved tricolores, while close-ups showed others with cymbals, trumpets, hooters. They were having a good time. Schumacher stood glaring, waiting for the ball to come back, but it was held on to, less by an individual, it seemed, than by the crowd as a whole. When, eventually, a Fifa technician gave Schumacher a fresh ball, he mimicked hurling it at the French fans, before taking the goal-kick. Had we just seen a humorous gesture - 'Would you like this ball too?' - or was it mockingly aggressive? After some seconds of surprised silence, boos began to be heard.</p> <p>Barely a minute later came the incident that has acquired such notoriety. Bossis won the ball with a superb tackle on Dremmler, and passed to Tigana, who laid it inside to Platini. With a momentary glance Platini appraised the scene before him, saw Battiston charging forward and floated the ball into the air. </p> <p>The pass had just the height, pace and backspin to take it beyond Karl-Heinz F\u00f6rster, to a spot where Battiston would reach it before the sweeper Uli Stielike, coming from the left, or Harald Schumacher charging out. </p> <p>Battiston got to the ball first and kicked it over the oncoming keeper's head. Everyone's gaze followed the ball, which bounced narrowly wide of goal, so people only glimpsed that Schumacher had made contact with Battiston. Watching replays, it was clear what had happened. As the German journalist Ulrich Hesse-Lichtenberger puts it: 'Just prior to crashing into Battiston he [Schumacher] did a little jump and turned his upper body in order to ease the impact. Ease it for himself, that is, as the helpless Battiston was hit in the face by Schumacher's hipbone with full force, immediately going down unconscious.'</p> <p>France players - and the West Germany captain, Kaltz - surrounded the stricken man and began waving for help. The French physio and doctor ran on, and immediately called for a stretcher. By grim chance the Seville police had, for some unknown reason, barred Red Cross officials from the sidelines. It took three minutes for a stretcher to appear, lifted up from some basement store beneath the stands. Eventually uniformed men with Red Cross armbands trotted on.</p> <p>Schumacher, meanwhile stood, impassively at the edge of his six-yard box, ball under one arm, the other hand on his hip. According to Hesse-Lichtenberger: 'His body language said: \"Get the guy off the pitch so that I can take my goal-kick.\"'</p> <p>Giresse and Janvion came to the touchline to tell their manager, Michel Hidalgo, what had happened to Battiston, and to work out how to rearrange the team, only for a Fifa official to step between them, since coaches were forbidden from discussing tactics with their players during the match. Hidalgo, furious, grumbled back to the dug-out. </p> <p>One might have thought the captain would have been the one to confer with the manager. But not this one. Platini later said that he thought his team-mate was dead. 'He had no pulse. He looked so pale.' Finally Battiston was carried off, accompanied on one side by a medic, on the other by Platini, who walked along bent towards Battiston's ashen face. The unconscious player's right arm flopped over the side of the stretcher, and Platini took Battiston's hand. He spoke softly to him as he walked. As they neared the edge of the pitch, Platini raised Battiston's hand and kissed it. </p> <p>Battiston lost two teeth, had three cracked ribs and damaged vertebrae, and was unconscious for almost half an hour. But now that he was off the pitch, play restarted, with indeed a goal-kick for West Germany, and no word of reprimand for Schumacher. </p> <p>A new substitute, Christian Lopez, came on for France and play got going. It appeared that if anything West Germany had been chastened by the incident, while France were hunting the ball. A purposeful fury seemed to burn through the team. Once, when the ball ran loose out on the left, Tr\u00e9sor chased after it and took off for a tackle like a long-jumper, a murderous, studs-up lunge from which Kaltz wisely stepped aside. While the referee reproved Tr\u00e9sor, Platini walked behind and ruffled his hair in blatant approval.</p> <p>The atmosphere crackled, with a feeling less of a sporting occasion than of some \u00e9v\u00e9nement, as if the players and the crowd were not in a sporting arena but all out on the street, and anything could happen.</p> <p>France attacked with further swift interchanges. But they could not score and now West Germany, midway through the half, began to stir again. Hans-Peter Briegel galvanised his team with one of his powerful runs out of defence. Magath almost got through on the left. Dremmler shot from the right, Ettori getting down well to hold on to the ball.</p> <p>After 72 minutes little Magath was replaced by his Hamburg club-mate, blond giant Horst Hrubesch, known as Das Kopfball-Ungeheuer, the Heading Beast. Hrubesch was just about as big as Briegel, who was 'a human Panzer division in himself', according to Brian Glanville. Kaltz, Schumacher, the F\u00f6rster brothers, too, could easily be imagined playing starring roles in some war film. It was hard not to notice the marked contrast to the multiracial French. Tr\u00e9sor had been born in Guadeloupe, Janvion in Martinique, Tigana in Mali, Lopez in Algeria. Platini, Amoros, Genghini were the children or grandchildren of immigrants. At the 1998 World Cup, Platini would not be alone in his opinion that 'the people who talk about a black, white and beur [North African] France were 30 years late. France has been black, white and beur for a long time. I was shocked by this discussion in '98. These people do not look around themselves very much.'</p> <p>By now, all four full-backs were wonderfully adventurous - Kaltz whipping in his bananenflanken, Bossis roaming forward - and they ended up more often tackling each other, overlapping, than the putative attackers. Didier Six, well placed on the six-yard line, shot tamely straight at Schumacher. At the other end, Breitner fed Briegel, who evaded Bossis's tackle and shot against the spread-eagled Ettori. The game was once more open, swaying one way then another. West German attacks were direct, pragmatic, incisive. The French either counter-attacked at thrilling speed or else slowed the tempo, worked their way slyly forwards. The better France played, the easier they made it look, trading the ball between each other, the West Germans apparently unwilling to intercept.</p> <p>With less than five minutes left, Tigana picked the ball up in his own half and surged down the right past first Breitner, then Briegel, and sent a marvellous cross hanging perfectly to the far post, where in the absence of a defender Rocheteau managed to get in Six's way, depriving the winger of a clear heading opportunity. The last chance of the 90 minutes, surely. </p> <p>But no. France once more gained possession. Platini laid the ball into the path of Amoros with a 20-yard gap in front of him. Amoros drove forward and from 35 yards out let fly a missile of a shot. Schumacher dived in vain, the ball flew over him, dipping, and on 90 minutes and 02 seconds hit the underside of the bar... and bounced out.</p> <p>There was, necessarily, a good deal of injury time to be added, in the third minute of which Tigana lost possession to Breitner, outside the left of the France penalty area. Breitner shot towards the far post. Ettori dived to his left but fumbled the ball: it dribbled away from him and, as he scuttled after it, Klaus Fischer bore down like a bird of prey. Denied a chance all night by Janvion, he was suddenly presented with this morsel. It was a race between the tips of Ettori's gloves and the toe of Fischer's right boot, which the Frenchman just, bravely, won, poking the ball away for a corner.</p> <p><strong>One-all, at full-time.</strong></p> <p>Now the managers could talk to their players, who collapsed on the grass. Trainers, physios, subs came on to pass round water, massage the muscles of tired legs. </p> <p>Those of us watching then - as now, so many years later - knew that we were witnessing something extraordinary, but few could have imagined how much more these players were to give us. In the third minute of extra time, Briegel obstructed Platini out on the right, and now something inexplicable happened. The penalty area was packed. As Giresse shaped to dispatch the free-kick, France players began to move, to dart this way and that, their markers shadowed them, and at the moment Giresse's cross arrived the middle of the penalty area was suddenly empty. Except for the French sweeper, Marius Tr\u00e9sor, who stood all alone just in front of the penalty spot. With perfect, joyful technique, he walloped the volley into the net.</p> <p><strong>Two-one.</strong></p> <p>The French celebrated and when play resumed there was something hectic about their movement. They dashed helter-skelter. It appears, watching the match again, as if they were intoxicated with a sense of justice. A wrong had been done, and was being put right, and the more they attacked so the more justice would be served. They broke forward again, Tigana shooting wide. </p> <p>Jupp Derwall brought his injured but totemic captain, current European Footballer of the Year Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, off the bench in place of Briegel, and the substitution jolted the Germans: a shock of effort rippled through the team, sending them pulsing forward, without threatening the French goal. On the contrary. In his own half, Giresse tapped a simple free-kick up the right to Rocheteau, who advanced and squared the ball to Platini on the front edge of the penalty area. Faced with three defenders ahead of him, Platini sent the ball on across to Six on the left. Six controlled the ball and then, in his most positive contribution of the match, caressed the ball from one foot to another while others moved around him: Platini went forward then suddenly out to the right, dragging defenders with him as if magnetised. Into space in the middle came Alain Giresse, and now Six laid the ball off gently, invitingly, into his path. Giresse met the ball with the outside of his right foot, giving it a flight path that curved outside Schumacher's dive and then inside towards the goal, glancing in off the right-hand post.</p> <p><strong>Three-one, in extra-time.</strong></p> <p>France did not sit on their lead, by playing square passes simply to keep possession. They wanted to score a fourth, and surged forward. Six was fouled, another Platini free-kick. This one ripped through the wall and cannoned back off Schumacher's chest.</p> <p>'Germany are dissolving,' the commentator Martin Tyler said. 'I can't remember ever saying that about a German side.' Giresse, Rocheteau, the marauding Bossis, Tigana and Platini attacked all together down the right. Six was in the middle ahead of them. This was how these musketeers would protect their lead: attack in numbers. Giresse was fouled and lay in pain. Rocheteau stopped playing to attend to his comrade, but the French retained possession and the referee waved play on. A moment later Platini was bundled off the ball: no free-kick was given and suddenly the French had lost possession with half their team stranded high upfield. Rummenigge and Littbarski combined on the vacant left, Stielike joined in, the sweeper at last making an advanced contribution with a fine pass out to Littbarski, who floated the ball forward into space at the near post between the France defence and the goalkeeper. Janvion and Rummenigge ran forward, Ettori rushed out, all three lunged but the West German got there first, and with a deft, incisive flick sent the ball past Ettori and fractionally inside the near post.</p> <p><strong>Three-two after 103 minutes. </strong></p> <p>Into the second period of extra time and, if there was a lesson to be learnt, France showed no sign of having learnt it. They seemed incapable of common sense or caution: compelled to win with swashbuckling style, they recalled the writer Andr\u00e9 Breton's dictum that 'beauty shall be convulsive, or not at all'. But all this emotion was exhausting. Tigana would keep running all night and Rocheteau remained a courageous, willing target man. Tr\u00e9sor was a towering figure at the heart of the defence. But all around them, one by one, French players were coming to a standstill.</p> <p>West Germany advanced down the left, Littbarski crossed, Hrubesch headed back from the far post into the middle. Klaus Fischer had been dominated throughout by Bernard Janvion. But a top-class striker has to be obtuse, undismayed by all that has gone before, eternally alert to that one opportunity. There were two defenders plus the goalkeeper on the line, but Fischer met Hrubesch's lay-off with a brilliantly executed bicycle kick into the top corner. </p> <p><strong>Three-three after 108 minutes. </strong></p> <p>Janvion was limping. Platini was drained. But still the game remained open. Like two blind, exhausted fighters the teams kept going. From a West German corner Fischer knocked the ball back into the danger area. Tr\u00e9sor leapt to head clear and the ball was worked up to Six, who played it out to space on the right into which Tigana - clearly in pain still from an earlier collision - struggled: he reached the ball before Stielike and shot, well wide. It was the last significant action of the game. Moments later Corver blew his whistle.</p> <p>'So, abominably, irrationally and unforgivably,' as Brian Glanville wrote, 'a World Cup semi-final would be decided, for the first time, on penalties.'</p> <p>Giresse, Kaltz, Amoros, Breitner and Rocheteau all scored. Uli Stielike shot weakly, Ettori easily saved. Stielike collapsed, curled up on the ground. Eventually, as if his body had doubled in weight, he dragged himself up and stumbled back towards his colleagues in the centre, bent head in hands, weeping. Littbarski came to meet him, and escorted him back, arm around the older man's shoulders.</p> <p>But then Didier Six shot softly to Schumacher's right, for an easy save, and Littbarski evened things up at 3-3.</p> <p>Platini and Rummenigge scored. Next up came Maxime Bossis. An exact contemporary of Platini - the two born just five days apart in June 1955 - they had done their military service together in the Joinville battalion, and their 10-year international careers ran in tandem. If Platini embodied the art of this team, Bossis encapsulated its spirit, and was prime candidate for man of the match. He struck his penalty to Schumacher's right, and watched as the goalkeeper dived the same way: although the shot was a half-decent one, the save was easy enough. </p> <p>Horst Hrubesch now lumbered up, and shot low and hard for the winning penalty. West Germany were through to the final.</p> <p>As Jupp Derwall asserted afterwards: 'You must give my players the credit they deserve, they showed such strength of character.' And so they had. 'The taste, however,' according to Brian Glanville, 'was exceedingly sour. Michel Hidalgo, by nature quiet and moderate, condemned Corver's flaccid refereeing. \"We have been eliminated brutally,\" he insisted.' Even in a recent interview, the wound for Hidalgo was still fresh. 'People witnessed a great injustice. The match reignited the Franco-German antagonism that had faded.'</p> <p>When Schumacher was told after the match that Battiston had lost two teeth, he said: 'If that's all that's wrong, tell him I'll pay for the crowns.' In a post-World Cup poll in a newspaper for the least popular person among the French, Schumacher shaded Adolf Hitler into second place. </p> <p>In the final Italy, to universal approval, won 3-1. According to Ulrich Hesse-Lichtenberger: 'The [West Germany] side returned home expecting to be hailed as the second best team in the world. Instead, the squad was met with frosty silence, if not outright disgust.'</p> <p>Two years later, on home soil, in the 1984 European Championship, France would pursue the destiny of which they had been robbed. Genghini's place in midfield was taken by Luis Fernandez, who ate up the ground and won the ball for the three artists around him, in a quartet that was given the sobriquet Le Carr\u00e9 Magique, the Magic Square. </p> <p>Playing with both panache and conviction, France won the tournament; Platini was the outstanding star, scoring from midfield nine of his side's 15 goals. Yet such is his insight into the meaning of sport, that no memory equals that torrid night in Seville, when he was on the losing side, but in every significant way emerged a winner.</p> <h2>Where are they now?</h2> <p><strong>France</strong></p> <p><strong>Patrick Battiston</strong></p> <p>Despite losing two teeth and suffering vertebra damage in the Schumacher challenge, Battiston doesn't bear a grudge: 'I feel no hate,' he said in July. The defender retired in 1991 after a second spell at Bordeaux and is now coach of that club's reserves.</p> <p><strong>Didier Six</strong></p> <p>The winger became a French pioneer in English football when he joined Aston Villa in 1984. He now runs a summer soccer camp in Metz, but wants a pro coaching job - in 2007 he complained that getting into management in France was like joining the mafia. </p> <p><strong>Marius Tresor</strong></p> <p>The scorer of France's second extra-time goal, Platini's predecessor as captain was named one of the 125 greatest players of all time by Pel\u00e9 in 2004. He finished his playing career at Bordeaux in 1984, and is now a director and assistant coach at the club. </p> <p><strong>West Germany</strong></p> <p><strong>Harald Schumacher</strong></p> <p>Nicknamed Toni, his international career was ended by allegations of substance abuse he made in a 1987 book. Schumacher now owns and runs SportsFirst, a consultancy agency with Bundesliga club Schalke 04 and the German FA on its books.</p> <p><strong>Karl-Heinz Rummenigge</strong></p> <p>The striker retired in 1989 before returning to his first club, Bayern Munich, as an executive in 1991. He became the club's chairman in 2002 and has since also become chairman of the European Club Association, the larger successor to the G-14 lobby group.</p> <p><strong>Pierre Littbarski</strong></p> <p>Scorer of West Germany's glorious opener, Littbarski ended his playing career in Japan in 1997. He has since become a well travelled manager in the J-League, Germany, Australia and Iran. He left struggling Iranian Premier League team Saipa in October.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Pink<br>Funhouse (SonyBMG) \u00a312.99</strong></p> <p>Pink's fifth album was to be called 'Heartbreak is a Motherfucker' until commercial sense prevailed. The fun here is mostly of the clench-jawed, hellbent variety, prompted by Pink's recent divorce ('I lost a husband,' begins her recent chart-topping single. 'So what? Im still a rock star!'). Having shot to fame with 2001's soul-baring Missundaztood, Alecia Moore is no stranger to laundering her dirty linen for fun and profit. Now on the cusp of 30, her Funhouse is a timely update, studded with age-appropriate ballads. But it's also packed with sufficient changes of pace (country, RB, Scandi-pop) to offset the record's monomania. <br><strong>Kitty Empire</strong></p> <p><strong>John Legend<br>Evolver (Columbia) \u00a312.99</strong></p> <p>John Legend is not one to sit still. When he isn't parading his fine singing voice, he's tackling poverty in Africa, managing record labels and generally overachieving. At the start of his third album, the Grammy-winning 29-year-old appears to be giving his soulful style a complete makeover. 'Green Light', the new upbeat single with Andre 3000, leads into the snappy funk of 'It's Over'. Then the tempo drops, and so does the inspiration. Apart from 'Good Morning', the rest sounds watered down, verging on bland. An evolutionary step in the wrong direction. <br><strong>Killian Fox</strong></p> <p><strong>Ryan Adams the Cardinals<br>Cardinology (Lost Highway) \u00a312.99</strong></p> <p>With extreme prolificacy comes patchiness: a truth Ryan Adams seems doomed to prove in his post-Whiskeytown career. His sixth album in three years, a mix of soft country moments and rowdy rock pop, is once again lacking in quality control. Too often the genesis of a captivating idea - 'the static in the attic is making me confused' - is swamped by repetitive refrains and unremarkable melodies. Ever confessional, Adams is best mining his troubled life in hushed spare ballads closing track 'Stop', a song of support for substance abusers, offers a raw, tantalising glimmer of what this album could have been.<br><strong>Katie Toms</strong></p> <p><strong>Chairlift<br>Does You Inspire You (Kanine Records) \u00a310.99</strong></p> <p>Apple's ad execs are certainly adept at spotting a catchy tune. Chairlift's quirky, Eighties-inspired 'Bruises' has become the latest iPod-flogging jingle. But those looking to this Brooklyn trio's MGMT-endorsed debut album for more upbeat sounds will find a largely dark collection of soundscapes and David Lynch-inspired mini-dramas. From the creepy surveillance-society critique of 'Earwig Town' to the cringe-making synth-chimes of 'Planet Health', this is a slightly patchy debut which will likely leave curious Eighties music fans intrigued but not satisfied.<br><strong>Imogen Carter</strong></p> <p><strong>Empty Boat<br>Waitless (Poo Productions) \u00a313.99</strong></p> <p>What can a big band do about sanitation in the developing world? Quite a lot, apparently. This British-based collective have forged links with Mozambique, culminating in an album that takes water as its theme and a fusion of Brazilian and African elements for its modus operandi. Leader and keyboardist Dean Brodrick has an ear for an intriguing melody, while a classy line-up supplies exotic combinations of horns, tuba and female choruses, with an occasional touch of birdsong. Its shuffling sambas and aquatic references are organic and funky rather than worthy, and every album sold equals lifelong sanitation for one person.<br><strong>Neil Spencer</strong></p> <p><strong>Richard Galliano<br>Love Day (Milan) \u00a312.99</strong></p> <p>If the idea of an accordion in jazz still puts you off, then Galliano is the man to change your mind. And this is probably the CD to do it, because he plays here with three top-flight jazz names: pianist Gonzalo Rubalcaba, bassist Charlie Haden and drummer Mino Cinelu. The 12 impressionistic pieces chart a day, from 'Aurore' to 'Cr\u00e9puscule', with Galliano coaxing such tonal delicacy from the button accordion as to banish all association with wheezy old squeeze-boxes. Equally remarkable is the ever-versatile Haden, whose bass lines blend in magically. Look out for this quartet at next month's London Jazz Festival. <br><strong>Dave Gelly</strong></p>",
  "<p>More than a fifth of the money market funds available to retail investors, promoted as a safe alternative to cash, have lost money over the last three months - and experts warn there could be further pain to come.</p> <p>The worst performer is the Threadneedle UK Money Securities Fund, which has lost almost 5 per cent over the last three months, according to figures from Morningstar. Two funds offered by Prudential, a further two from F&amp;C and one from M&amp;G have also lost between 0.1 and 2 per cent.</p> <p>These are some of the new breed of 'cash plus funds', which aimed to offer a small premium above the rates from cash deposits by investing in areas such as asset-backed securities - credit cards, mortgages and other loans which are parcelled up and sold to investors - and certificates of deposit. Their value has plunged since the financial crisis took hold and there could be further falls.</p> <p>Threadneedle's fund, for example, has a third of its assets in asset-backed floating-rate notes. A spokesman said that these had started to recover after the various government bail-outs of banks, but 'the deteriorating economic background which has affected all markets has impacted the recovery, which in turn has affected the fund's recent performance'.</p> <p>F&amp;C's Sterling Enhanced Cash fund - which has lost 1 per cent in the last month alone - is almost 50 per cent invested in asset-backed securities. It changed its pricing basis in the summer, following a dramatic drop in its value, compensating some investors who had lost out, but its performance remains poor.</p> <p>Tony Andrews, manager of the Henderson Cash fund - which has made 1.13 per cent in the last month - said: 'The rational investor has to be confident with the portfolio they are buying. For certain types of asset, questions need to be asked.' His fund has never invested in asset-backed securities and other riskier instruments.</p>",
  "<p><strong>The following apology was printed in the Observer's For the record column, Sunday November 9 2008</strong></p> <p>We accept that shadow sports minister Hugh Robertson did not make the remarks we attributed to him in the article below. We should clarify that Mr Robertson's criticism of the composition of England's 2018 World Cup bid board encompasses two points: he maintains that three, not five, politicians should sit on the nine-member board and he believes that there is a consequent lack of expertise on the board from the Union of European Football Associations and the International Federation of Association Football. Apologies.</p> <p> </p> <p>What on earth is she doing there?' asked the shadow sports minister, Hugh Robertson, on the appointment of Baroness Amos to England's 2018 World Cup bid. With Amos being a former Secretary of State for International Development, a former Leader of the House of Lords and a passionate sports fan, what was the Conservative MP so upset about?</p> <p>Last week's revelation of a row between the English and Jamaican Football Associations, which threatened to derail the bid, underlined just how vital contacts in the Caribbean will be to win that block vote, an area - along with Africa and the Commonwealth generally - of expertise for Amos. </p> <p>Still, her appointment was reported with a great deal of scepticism. The Independent went so far as to say, 'If Lord Triesman [the FA chairman] wants a black/female presence to impress Fifa, surely the feisty Millwall chair Heather Rabbatts would be ideal', the implication being there is room for only one black woman on the board. </p> <p>All the reports described Amos as knowing very little about football, a fact she contests with a charitable laugh. 'The assumption is that because I'm a woman and I'm in politics I can't know anything about football. But nobody actually rang me up and asked me. I can see that people might jump to conclusions, but it would be nice to be asked.'</p> <p>Amos has been a Tottenham fan since she first arrived in England from Guyana, aged nine. 'We've always been a sports-mad family. I love cricket, football, tennis, athletics. My dad came over in 1961, a famous year for Spurs, and was living in north London. The rest of us came over in '63, but that love affair he started with Spurs seeped into the family. I go to White Hart Lane when I can, but I love any live sport. When I was at university in Birmingham I watched West Bromwich Albion for the 1976-77 season. It was the chance to watch live football.'</p> <p>She was thrilled to be asked by Triesman to join the board: 'It came completely out of the blue, it was wonderful. Having an opportunity to bring the World Cup here in 2018 is something I will work my socks off to achieve. I have strong international connections, my knowledge and expertise are the reasons I have been asked to go on the board. The added value is that I'm a football fan.'</p> <p>During the last World Cup Amos showed her football allegiances by painting the St George's Cross on her fingernails. 'Every match we won I did another fingernail. I thought it was important to support England, but at that time there were a lot of politicians jumping on the bandwagon and I didn't want to be associated with that. I wanted a demonstrable way of indicating my support, I happened to be getting my nails done at the time and so I hit on this idea.'</p> <p>As a former chief executive of the Equal Opportunities Commission, Baroness Amos is no stranger to the issue of under-representation of women in sports-leadership roles and would not have been surprised at how her appointment was greeted. In 2006, she addressed Parliament on the subject, saying: 'The most depressing thing I have read in relation to sport is that the FA's women's committee... has just two women members out of a total board of 10. If that does not point out the difficulties that we face in this arena, I do not know what does.'</p> <p>Two years later and the statistics remain grim. Only Karren Brady, managing director of Birmingham, and Delia Smith, joint majority shareholder at Norwich, occupy prominent positions in football's national consciousness. Only four of the leading 35 British national governing bodies (NGBs) of sport have a female chief executive, while women make up a quarter of all NGB board members. It is the same percentage among elite coaches. </p> <p>Contrast that to the United States - whose NFL teams, the New Orleans Saints and the San Diego Chargers, play at Wembley this afternoon - and the UK appears to be seriously lagging behind. Both visiting teams have senior women in the boardroom. Jeanne M Bonk is executive vice-president of the Chargers and Rita Benson LeBlanc is in the same role for the Saints, as well as being part-owner of the club. There are others: Denise DeBartolo York owns the San Francisco 49ers, Virginia Halas McCaskey owns the Chicago Bears, Amy Trask is chief executive of the Oakland Raiders... the list goes on.</p> <p>'Having all these women in powerful roles is to do with the family-like nature of our sport,' says LeBlanc, whose grandfather Tom Benson bought the New Orleans club in 1985. 'In the initial process of daughters being encouraged to get involved, it helped other women to get in. It is one of the great strengths of the NFL. </p> <p>'Women are still in a minority in the boardroom, but it's shifting. The league has an NFL managers' programme to cultivate talent and there are women and minorities included in that. There are small steps being taken.' LeBlanc may see them as small, but the equivalent over here - the Premier League encouraging recruitment of women and ethnic minorities into the management structure of their clubs - is unimaginable.</p> <p>While women at the top level of UK sport, such as Smith, Brady and Amos, have all climbed the ladder and then sidestepped over to sport, in the US it is common for women to progress through the ranks. 'I have street credit because I earned my stripes like everyone else,' says LeBlanc. 'I started out working summers at the club as a teenager, I spent time in the scouting department collecting statistics for the draft. Interestingly, I believe the Pittsburgh Steelers and Buffalo Bills both have women scouting for them.'</p> <p>LeBlanc's biggest achievement is the turnaround of the club's fortunes after the disaster of Hurricane Katrina. Organising the return to the Louisiana Superdome and slashing ticket prices to help the fans attend - not to mention an uplift in results - have helped her popularity. Aged 31 and the youngest woman to run an NFL team, she is already being tipped to take full control of the club from her grandfather. </p> <p>Does LeBlanc ever feel she is judged because she is a woman? 'I remember reading Condoleezza Rice's autobiography and people asked if she felt challenged as a woman or a black woman, and Rice [George W Bush's Secretary of State and former National Security Advisor] said she never let that into her consciousness. I'm the same. I won't suffer foolish behaviour from others. I have a look that says, \"Don't go there.\" And they don't.'</p> <p>Brady has a similar tough reputation. When she was first appointed, 15 years ago, jaws dropped. 'I couldn't understand what all the fuss was about,' she says. She quickly earned the respect of her colleagues, making Birmingham the sixth most profitable club in football, an achievement that went hand in hand with a legendary anecdote. A Birmingham player famously quipped: 'I can see your tits in that shirt' to which Brady replied: 'Well, don't worry, when I sell you to Crewe, you won't be able to see them from there.'</p> <p>'It's true, I did say that,' she says. 'He didn't get transferred to Crewe, but he did go a long way away. I won't tell you who it is because he'd die of embarrassment and his wife would probably kill him.'</p> <p>Brady has promoted women into managerial positions at Birmingham and wishes more clubs would follow suit. 'In my business, 75 per cent of my senior management are women. I think football was slow to grasp the idea that it was a place where women could and should work. But with the overseas investors coming into the game and lots of them employing women in their businesses, I think things are going to change very quickly.'</p> <p>Brady maintains that football is a challenge for a woman. 'It's a six-day a week job with inflexible hours, and with a family that's not always easy to manage. From the outside it can look like a very male dominated business.' </p> <p>Has anything changed during her 15-year tenure? 'When I joined, attitudes were unbelievable, women weren't allowed into boardrooms, they had \"ladies rooms\", whatever they were.' It is different now, but outdated attitudes are not entirely dead. 'When Norwich were last in the Premier League, Delia came to a meeting and said she would like to be more involved. So Doug Ellis [then owner of Aston Villa] said, \"Oh yes, Delia dear, we'll set you up a catering committee.\" Her ears were steaming, you can imagine.'</p> <p>She laughs uproariously at the story of Barnsley's 'strictly male personnel only' sign barring women from the tunnel, removed this year after complaints. 'There's probably a law against that! It's unbelievable isn't it? It's like saying \"no old people\".'</p> <p>Brady believes there are women making important contributions in football, but we are slow to recognise them. 'I guess I'm the one they always wheel out, when there are a lot of other women doing great things. I hope that if I were ever to move on, one of the women here would have the opportunity to take over my role. Football is playing catch-up, it's taken women a long time, but it's a wonderful industry to work in and I really believe we will get there.'</p> <p>Perhaps if England win the 2018 bid, Baroness Amos's role will be celebrated and another attitudinal shift will open the doors for more women to come through.</p> <p>\u2022 Karren Brady supports the launch of the new Treo Pro smartphone by Palm available now - <a href=\"http://www.palm.com\">palm.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The Batsheva Dance Company, based in Tel Aviv, was founded in 1964 by Martha Graham and Baroness Batsheva de Rothschild. Led by veteran choreographer Ohad Naharin, the ensemble is considered Israel's leading cultural ambassador. This puts it in the political line of fire and audiences at last Monday's first night were targeted by protesters suggesting Batsheva should be boycotted for endorsing 'Israel's apartheid policies'. Naharin describes the company's HQ as 'an oasis in all the madness'. Maybe, he says, he and his dancers 'can affect something much bigger than us'.</p> <p>Naharin's latest work, Three, is probably not that something. Divided into as many parts, it opens with a series of twitchy reflections set to Bach's Goldberg Variations. Since this is the Glenn Gould recording, we are already in idiosyncratic territory, and Naharin ramps up the whimsy with quirkily inventive duets, jarring direction changes and skilful pratfalls. The dancers, in bright leisure tops and cutoffs, are strong and assured beneath the flat overhead lighting, but where Naharin is taking us is anyone's guess.</p> <p>The second part, to a non-committal score by Brian Eno, is no more enlightening. For 20 minutes, the Batsheva women dance in unison, occasionally interestingly but mostly not. The third section sees the ensemble splintering into groups. Movements start small and morph into kinetic body waves or arching arabesques. Quixotic man-on-man duets are studded with ballroom and ballet motifs and interrupted by random-seeming blackouts. Craft levels are high, but Naharin strains for novelty and effect. A final parade sees the dancers exposing parts of themselves - palms, ribs, feet - as if inviting us to check for stigmata. The piece winds to a halt with abject displays of bum crack and pubic hair. If this is the oasis, give me the desert.</p>",
  "<p>Amid the bureaucratic prose of his dreadful book The Blair Revolution, Peter Mandelson managed to articulate one noble thought. Writing in 1996, when the old Soviet empire lay in ruins, he declared that the European Union must move into central and eastern Europe to 'strengthen security, entrench democracy and ensure economic and social progress spread across the whole continent'.</p> <p>He could plausibly believe then that Tony Blair would be at the forefront of a new Europe, free and at peace. Now, his optimism seems a dream from another age. Putin's autocratic regime of former KGB men and crony capitalist backers laments the loss of the empire of the tsars and commissars and gives every sign of wanting to take it back. After the war in Georgia, and with the recession bringing Ukraine close to collapse, the chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff had to fly to Lithuania last week to promise the former occupied territories that Nato would protect them.</p> <p>MI5 says there are as many Russian spies in Britain today as at the height of the Cold War. Putin's state security apparatus monitors Russian dissidents in London and displays no visible sign of regret when they are horribly murdered.</p> <p>Yet Mandelson and politicians like him, who once wanted to entrench democracy and progress across Europe, see nothing wrong with consorting with the oligarchy, although I suspect it has taken newspapers readers a while to understand the magnitude of their moral failure.</p> <p>The Deripaska affair is a puzzle to outsiders because the press can't quite say what it is about. When George Osborne briefed the press, the story was that Mandelson was spreading poison about Gordon Brown. His stay on Deripaska's yacht and dinners with the oligarch in Moscow's restaurants quickly superseded tales of back-stabbing, because journalists realised Mandelson's decisions as European Trade Commissioner affected the interests of one of the world's richest men.</p> <p>When Nathaniel Rothschild wrote that Osborne had talked about soliciting donations from Deripaska, we decided one Bullingdon Club member was punishing another for breaking the omert\u00e0 of upper-class house parties. Business journalists intervened to point out that a little more than gentlemanly pride was at stake for Rothschild. Deripaska's money helped him increase his fortune, but the Russian was not coping well with the financial crisis. Rothschild had to attack Osborne for drawing attention to a shadowy man who had contributed towards the cost of Rothschild's Klosters chalet, where, inevitably, Mandelson was a frequent guest.</p> <p>Those naive souls who worry about political - oh I don't know - decorum then watched open-mouthed as within weeks of allowing the super-rich to pass him around like a half-drunk bottle of Cristal, Mandelson returned to Whitehall and demanded restrictions on the employment rights of working mothers. Osborne could not beat that although he tried. After staying with the Rothschilds and visiting the Deripaskas in Corfu, he announced that the Tories were the only party truly committed to tackling poverty.</p> <p>For all the apparent ruthlessness, the media are dancing around the main point. It is not showing what should be at the heart of the affair: a proper sense of outrage at Mandelson, Osborne and Rothschild's belief that the tame oligarchs of a dangerous autocracy are no better or worse than other industrialists. </p> <p>My colleagues are not to blame for pulling punches. London not only offers crony capitalists Michelin-starred restaurants, security guards and discreet bankers. Our authoritarian libel laws also attract the rich. Editors think once, twice, 100 times before crossing them. They know they must contend with libel judges and Law Lords unfit to hold office in an open society because they won't stand up for freedom of speech.</p> <p>Reading between the lines, you may realise that when reporters talk about 'the aluminium wars' that turned Deripaska into a tycoon in Nineties' Siberia, we do not use 'war' figuratively. Notice, too, how often we say that the State Department revoked Deripaska's visa to enter the US in 2006 and how rarely we explain why.</p> <p>Judges graciously lift libel restrictions when journalists report their verdicts. I can therefore give you a taste of the company the political class is keeping by quoting a ruling by Mr Justice Christopher Clarke at the High Court on 3 July.</p> <p>He was hearing the claim of Michael Cherney. Like so many who try to do business in Russia, the exile alleges that the associates of the Kremlin cheated him. He feared arrest if he went home to demand $4.35bn from his former partner, one Oleg Deripaska, and asked London courts to hear his case instead. Deripaska denied he owed Cherney a rouble and insisted that any hearing should be in Russia.</p> <p>In his ruling on where the trial should take place, the judge described how he had heard the evidence of Bill Bowring, professor of law at Birkbeck College, and an authority on civil rights in Putin's Russia. It gave 'substantial support' to the conclusion that exiled enemies of the Kremlin and its backers would be arrested if they returned.</p> <p>'Deripaska is, by common account, a Kremlin-friendly oligarch, who heeded President Putin's warning to the oligarchs to stay out of politics,' the professor said. 'Others have found themselves in exile or in a Siberian labour camp. But Mr Deripaska emerged as the triumphant leader of the Kremlin-friendly oligarchs whose ability to continue to do business is dependent on obedience to the Kremlin and who can count, in turn, on support from the government and the judicial system. He has funded President Putin's pet projects. [His] Rusal group is one of the most important assets of the Russian state.'</p> <p>Without accusing Deripaska, the judge accepted that the trial could not take place in Russia because of 'the risk of a successful assassination'. Cherney had a 'well-founded fear for his safety'. Nor, continued the judge, could he expect a fair trial. 'It seems to me that there is a significant likelihood of Mr Cherney being prosecuted if he returns and a real possibility that Mr Deripaska might use his influence or his ability to orchestrate feeling against Mr Cherney.'</p> <p>In a sentence that resonated with all who know the history of communist show trials, the judge added that 'the use of criminal prosecutions [or the threat of them] as tools in a power struggle with rivals was a feature of Soviet Russia.

Perhaps I was harsh. In 1996, he wrote that voters believed they had 'a government that consists of business back-scratchers and a parliament made up of politicians on the make'. Ain't that the truth.</p>",
  "<p>James Bond is back, with his suits, stunts and slain enemies. But where is the sex? A friend who has seen a preview says there is a distinct lack of flirting and double entendres. 'What's happened to the battle of the sexes?' he moaned. 'There's no fun, just killing.'</p> <p>Well, I replied, all the flirting, sexiness, passion and tension that you could ever need - enough for 10 Bond movies - is on the telly these days, on the BBC's Strictly Come Dancing</p> <p>Like millions of others, I have fallen in love with this show and its subject matter. A few years ago, my parents became smitten with ballroom and Latin American dancing and were transformed. They started going to classes three times a week, talked about it with contagious enthusiasm and even practised in their living room, in full view of their neighbours. </p> <p>I couldn't help but join in. I used to think I had two left feet, but now I can waltz, quickstep, cha-cha, samba, salsa, tango, rumba and jive.</p> <p>Of course, here in Scotland, among the tougher religions of the north, it used to be said that dancing is the devil's work. And it's true that there should be a health warning.</p> <p>Dancing takes you places you don't expect. You have to let go of yourself, lose your inhibitions, surrender control, swivel your hips. Which for repressed, uptight people like me and, dare I say it, quite a lot of Brits and definitely swimmer Mark Foster, can be surprisingly difficult.</p> <p>You can see it in Strictly. It is not surprising that every series is accompanied by rumours about affairs, jealousy and relationship breakdowns. A few years ago, newsreader Natasha Kaplinsky was forced to issue a denial that she was doing more than just dancing with professional dancer Brendan Cole. Now gossip has it that his current girlfriend is so worried about the growing chemistry between him and George Clooney's ex Lisa Snowdon that she is attending their training sessions.</p> <p>Last year's series had similar drama. GMTV presenter Kate Garraway won damages following false claims she had a fling with her dance partner Anton du Beke. The series also resulted in the end of the decade-long partnership between professionals Flavia Cacace and Vincent Simone when she fell for EastEnders actor Matt di Angelo. He was clearly head over heels. As Flavia said at the time: 'Sexual chemistry and having fun is very important when you're dancing.'</p> <p>Indeed it is.</p> <p>In the right circumstances, it can be powerful medicine. Watching my parents dance after 37 years of marriage is inspiring. My father, a lovely man but one not inclined to let himself go or express too much emotion, unless Celtic won a European Cup, is a sight to see strutting his stuff on a dance floor.</p> <p>Yet the dangers are obvious. I fall in love with my teacher every time I dance with him. It doesn't matter that he's married and 70. He looks two decades younger and moves like a dream. Cares and worries fall away when I am led around the dance floor by him. Credit crunch, falling house prices, increasing unemployment? So what?</p> <p>So let Bond carry his troubles with him as he seeks revenge and eschews sexual intrigue. I'll be on the sofa on Saturday night. Give me John Sergeant. And Bond girls? I'd far rather Kristina Rihanoff. The devil's got all the best moves.</p>",
  "<p>The Springbok, traditional emblem of South African rugby, is under threat as a sporting row adds to the problems of the African National Congress party.</p> <p>At its congress in Polokwane in December last year, the ANC voted to have the springbok removed from rugby jerseys and replaced by the king protea flower which all other South African national teams play under. </p> <p>Now comments ascribed on a website to international loose forward Luke Watson have re-ignited the argument. He was alleged to have said he nearly wanted to 'vomit on the bok jersey', and that the sport remains racist and 'run by Dutchmen'. The white Western Province flanker, son of anti-apartheid activist Cheeky Watson, has now made himself unavailable for the Springboks' November tour, which includes Tests against Wales, England and Scotland, claiming he is the victim of a media 'witch-hunt' designed to discredit his views on changing South African sport. Watson now faces disciplinary action from the South African Rugby Union (Saru), which was due to announce its selections for the touring party this weekend. The controversy also comes just a week before the expected inaugural congress of a breakaway wing of the ANC.</p> <p>ANC sports portfolio committee chairman Butana Komphela had earlier said the emblem 'also makes me want to puke'. Pro-springbok campaigners responded by sending Valoid - an anti-nausea drug - to Watson and Komphela.</p> <p>The springbok has been the mascot of South African rugby since 1906 and became the sports emblem of the National Party during apartheid. After the first all-race elections in 1994, all other South African national teams - including football and cricket - adopted the protea as their logo.</p> <p>In 1995, in a move seen as crucial to the peaceful emergence of the 'Rainbow Nation', former President Nelson Mandela ruled that the national senior rugby team would be allowed to keep the springbok - despite its association with white supremacy. Since 2003, the rugby team's logo has featured both the protea and the springbok. </p> <p>Among the party's grassroots, however, the mood appears to have turned. 'The continued use of the springbok is akin to the German national team wearing the swastika,' said Asad Bhorat, president of the Soweto Rugby Club.</p> <p>The reaction from springbok-supporters has been rapid and impassioned. Saru president Oregan Hoskins said he was campaigning for the springbok's survival because 'it is now something every youngster aspires to'.</p> <p>At a conference called in Durban earlier this month to discuss integration in South African sport and the country's poor showing at the Olympics, sports minister Makhenkesi Stofile called for a compromise. He suggested the king protea could be displayed on the left side of players' jerseys, with the springbok moved to the right where it would replace an existing sponsor's logo.</p> <p>Saru will not want to lose sponsorship income, but may be forced to accept the suggestion in order to gain government endorsement for South Africa's bid to host the rugby world cup.</p> <p>As the row threatened to escalate, ANC spokeswoman Jessie Duarte said: 'The ANC would not like to see any change of the springbok emblem until sufficient debate has taken place.'</p> <p>But Komphela says attempts to save the springbok show 'the arrogance of white people'. On Tuesday he told parliament: 'It is not their springbok. It is ours. We own the trademark by law.'</p>",
  "<p>Perhaps it was the bondage trousers his mother was so famous for creating in the 1970s but photographer Ben Westwood has made a career of depicting what some might see as the more explicit end of soft pornography.</p> <p>Now he is moving onto the political frontline by spearheading a campaign against anti-pornography <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/law\">legislation</a> that is due to come into force some time next year. He believes it will make possession of his own <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/photography\">photography</a> and other art illegal.</p> <p>Westwood, 45, eldest son of fashion designer Vivienne and her first husband, Derek Westwood, has joined the campaign Caan - the Consenting Adults Action Network - which claims he is the first of several artists and celebrities planning to lend their names to the battle to overturn section 63 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008, which gained royal assent earlier this year. It was intended to target people who view illegal hardcore pornography websites. Under the new rules, criminal responsibility shifts from the producer - who is already responsible under the 1959 Obscene Publications Act - to the consumer. It makes it illegal to have pornographic material that depicts necrophilia, bestiality or violence that looks life-threatening or likely to result in serious injury to the breasts or genitals.</p> <p>Campaigners fear the new law will criminalise thousands of people who use violent pornographic images as part of consensual <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/relationships\">sexual relationships</a>. 'They say this is about violence but it's distinctly about sex,' said Westwood. 'I feel the stick is always pointed at pornography as this terrible corrupting influence, this idea that it makes people do things that they wouldn't have done otherwise. </p> <p>'My work has always been a campaign against that view. Now I find that someone is deciding to make owning my work a criminal offence. I don't think there should be laws, any laws, about sexuality. There are plenty of laws against physically damaging a person.'</p> <p>Westwood's book of fetish-themed photography, F**K Fashion, published in 2005, contains images of women bound and gagged. 'The women are all beautiful consenting models,' said Westwood. 'Effectively, anyone who has a copy of my book could soon find they are breaking the law.'</p> <p>The law means artists such as the Chapman brothers and Tracey Emin could find their work falling foul of the law. The Home Office insists the act is meant to target only internet porn.</p> <p>The outlawing of 'extreme pornography' was itself the result of a three-year campaign by Liz Longhurst and MP Martin Salter who collected 50,000 signatures on a petition and won backing from police and the Home Office. Longhurst's 31-year-old daughter, Jane, was brutally murdered in 2003 by Graham Coutts, who had been viewing extreme pornographic sites depicting scenes of strangulation and faked murder and rape before he killed. He was jailed for at least 26 years.</p> <p>Mrs Longhurst has said she is aware that many people see her as 'a horrible killjoy' but believes that if Coutts, who was referred to a psychiatrist as a teenager because of his murderous fantasies, had not had access to the porn sites her daughter would still be alive.</p> <p>Salter said the ban was not a moral crusade but just plugging a legal loophole. 'This is not widening the law on anything that isn't already illegal, these sites are illegal but we can't block them because they take place in cyberspace, outwith the UK,' he said. 'People like Westwood need to understand we are not being prudish, we are not ratcheting up any bans on porn, just extending the law to cover people using it and trying to reduce the market for this stuff. No one is trying to stop consenting adults doing whatever they want in the bedroom.'</p> <p>One of the sites used by Coutts is still available and another has simply changed its name after a campaign by the Mail of Sunday to close it down.</p>",
  "<p>If you want to track the zeitgeist, then Google Trends (<a href=\"http://www.google.com/trends\">google.com/trends</a>) is a good place to start. Type in a search phrase and you get a graph showing how its popularity with Google searchers has varied. 'Sarah Palin' first appears in February, but queries about her bump along the floor until mid-August, when there's a sudden spike, and she's been up and down ever since. </p> <p>An announcement from Amazon last week prompted your columnist to reach for Google Trends in a different context. The online retailer revealed that its 'cloud computing' service - which enables customers to have their IT services provided by Amazon on a pay-for-use basis, rather than buying all the hardware and software themselves - is ready for primetime. Among other things, Amazon Web Services now offer support for Microsoft's Windows and SQL Server, a 'service level agreement' that guarantees 99.95 per cent uptime, and four features designed to appeal to corporate IT managers: a virtual console for managing virtual servers; load balancing; automatic scaling; and intensive monitoring of the services for which one is paying.</p> <p>Google Trends reveals that 'cloud computing' first starts to figure in queries in 2007. Interest grew slowly until April this year, when <a href=\"http://www.Salesforce.com \">Salesforce.com </a>announced a deal with Google. There's another peak in July, when Yahoo, Intel and HP announced they were collaborating with several universities to set up cloud computing labs. This week's news from Amazon will doubtless produce an even bigger spike in Google searches by people wondering what's going on.</p> <p>If you believe the enthusiasts, it's nothing less than our old friend, the paradigm shift. We're moving, they say, from a world in which every organisation provided its own IT services - complete with data centres, hardware, software, network and support staff - to one in which companies outsource most of their IT requirements to operations such as Amazon Web Services and access them via the internet. This is what Nicholas Carr, a prominent commentator, calls 'The Big Switch' - the title of his recent book on the topic. His analogy is that of electricity generation: once, most companies had their own generators; now they buy electricity from big utilities. Computing, he says, is heading in the same direction, and for many of the same reasons.</p> <p>What reasons? Werner Vogels, Amazon's chief technology officer, says: 'These are times when many companies are focusing on their IT operations and asking themselves how they can operate more efficiently. This is not the first time we have gone through this cycle, but now there are tools available that help them to manage their IT budgets very differently. By using infrastructure as a service, basic IT costs are moved from a capital expense to a variable cost, building clearer relationships between expenditures and revenue-generating activities.' </p> <p>Well, he would say that, wouldn't he? But Vogels claims that Amazon is seeing a surge of interest - 'from young businesses to Fortune 500 enterprises, from research labs to television networks' - in moving to the cloud to get a better grip on costs. And he clearly thinks that an economic downturn will stimulate companies to ask awkward questions about the cost-effectiveness of maintaining their own IT services.</p> <p>Those questions are long overdue. I recently saw an interesting presentation by Irving Wladawsky-Berger, for many years an eminent figure in IBM. One slide showed how the costs of providing IT services have changed since 1996. Over that period, the proportion of cost attributable to hardware has fallen appreciably, as you'd expect. But the percentage taken by 'server management and administration' has risen from 20 per cent in 1996 to nearly 60 per cent today. And energy costs have gone from a negligible proportion in 1996 to about 16 per cent today.</p> <p>To corporate executives facing recession, these numbers will speak for themselves. As indeed does the title of Wladawsky-Berger's presentation: 'Cloud computing and the Coming IT Cambrian Explosion'. If you're wondering what that geological reference implies, check it out on Wikipedia (<a href=\"http://bit.ly/2I5iyI\">http://bit.ly/2I5iyI</a>): the Cambrian period triggered a staggering increase in the pace of evolutionary development, as measured by the rate at which species appeared and disappeared. For some of our most established IT companies, Vogels's cloud may have a darker lining than they expect.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:john.naughton@observer.co.uk\">john.naughton@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>She was America's sweetheart, whose rise to stardom seemed a Hollywood fairytale come true. But now the family of actress and singer Jennifer Hudson have been struck by a lethal tragedy that yesterday shocked many Americans. </p> <p>Both Hudson's mother, Darnell Hudson Donerson, and brother, Jason Hudson, have apparently been murdered, possibly in a domestic argument. Her seven-year-old nephew, Julian King, is missing and was the subject of a police manhunt across the state of Illinois. The youngster's whereabouts have police baffled and deeply concerned.</p> <p>Both victims were discovered shot dead inside Donerson's house on the South Side of Chicago. There was no sign of forced entry and police later arrested William Balfour, who was married to the actress's sister and who was also thought to live at the property. No charges have yet been filed.</p> <p>The horrific deaths have plunged Hudson into the depths of an all too common American shooting tragedy. Born and raised to working-class parents in the city, her father was a bus driver. She first came to national attention on the hit talent show American Idol. Though the show can often be a career graveyard for many of its reality TV contestants, Hudson broke the mould. Despite only finishing in seventh place out of twelve in the finals, she won a role in the Hollywood film Dreamgirls, as Effie White.</p> <p>The part was a path to success and Hudson was a huge hit winning her dozens of awards for the character, culminating in an Oscar in 2007 for best supporting actress. She then went on to star in the movie Sex and the City and the current release The Secret Life of Bees</p> <p>Despite her fame, Hudson stayed true to her roots. Her close family did not leave the South Side, despite its reputation for crime and urban poverty. 'That says a lot about the kind of family that Jennifer comes from. They're a family of faith,' local pastor Willie Davis said. </p> <p>Few details of the killings have emerged, but police in Chicago were portraying the murders as an apparent domestic dispute. Neighbours reported hearing shots from the house on Friday morning but it was not until 3pm that a relative searched the premises and discovered Hudson's mother in the living room. Police then searched the rest of the house and found the second victim upstairs. Both had been shot several times with one of the bodies - police did not reveal which one - showing signs of 'defensive wounds' indicating some sort of struggle before death.</p> <p>Potentially the most disturbing aspect of the case is the disappearance of King. Following fears the youngster may have been taken out of Illinois, the city authorities have called in the FBI. Police sources said they had hoped to find King when they arrested Balfour, but the boy had not been present.</p> <p>Balfour had been paroled from prison in 2006 after convictions for attempted murder and car hijacking. His mother, speaking outside the Chicago police station where he was being questioned, protested his innocence. 'My son had nothing to do with this,' she said.</p> <p>Hudson's large family were said to be in deep mourning following the deaths. The star herself, described as being in shock, travelled from Florida to be with her relatives. She identified both bodies at a local morgue. Said to be very close to her mother, she often cited her in interviews as a source of inspiration. </p> <p>A brief statement issued by Hudson's publicist said: 'The family has asked that their privacy be respected at this time.'</p> <p>However, some members of the family did talk to the media. John Buckner, a cousin of Hudson's mother, told the Chicago Sun-Times: 'She was a wonderful person. A very sweet person. She'd open up her door to anyone.'</p>",
  "<p>The trajectory of Michael Emmett's formative years never deviated from one inexorable conclusion: he was always going to end up in prison. Emmett's father was a career criminal who knew the Krays, and it was not long before junior followed senior into the family smuggling business, chiefly as a way of paying for his drugs and drink. </p> <p>It was a time of reckless living and hard partying. Emmett, by his own admission, went off the rails. 'There was nothing legal about me whatsoever,' he recounted years later. </p> <p>Then, in 1993, Emmett hit the big time, at least in terms of leaving a lasting imprint on the criminal justice system. After a couple of short spells inside for theft and dodgy deals involving antiques, he was caught with his father trying to smuggle \u00a39m of cannabis into the UK in what, at the time, was one of the biggest drug busts in history. </p> <p>Father and son were sentenced together and Emmett junior got 12 years. 'It's odd going to prison with your dad,' he would remark to friends, as if recalling a family trip to the zoo.</p> <p>But what was more odd was what happened to Emmett, now 50, after he was sentenced. Having played the hard man - the sort of person who gloried in their facial scars and nebulous connections to London's most notorious East End firms - in his first few months at Her Majesty's Prison Exeter, he started going to the prison chapel, chiefly because it entitled him to a free phone call. </p> <p>It was from there that Emmett began to develop an interest in religion. He came to see faith as a chance to turn his life around. After badgering the chaplain to introduce an evangelical Alpha course that he had read about, Emmett found Jesus in the unlikely confines of an austere Victorian jail more familiar with sapping souls than saving them. </p> <p>'I had a lot of ridicule about it all because of who I was,' he said. 'Other people in the prison thought I was just working my ticket to get parole.' But his beliefs helped him to kick drugs and start his life afresh. He ran several businesses once he got out of jail in 1998 and was able to help others, in his words, 'discover a relationship with God'.</p> <p>There are thousands of others like Emmett who 'have found the Lord in prison' and made spectacular breaks with their criminal pasts, the sort of brutal splintering that secular groups working with reoffenders rarely achieve. For the unspoken truth is that, in an increasingly irreligious society, Jesus continues to walk the wings of Britain's prisons, offering salvation to those who have no other chance of saving themselves. And if the government gets its way, Jesus is going to assume a greater role in the criminal justice system. </p> <p>A new consultation document, 'Working with the Third Sector to Reduce Reoffending', produced by the Ministry of Justice, outlines ways of expanding the work of faith groups with offenders. 'Faith organisations can help build trust and acceptance and support effective reintegration,' the ministry claims.</p> <p>The government's logic for encouraging the role of faith groups in prison is based on simple economics. At a time when the ministry is having to find about \u00a31bn of savings, faith-based organisations provide support networks on the cheap. Most have charitable status and can draw on funds dating back to handsome legacies gifted to them by Victorian patriarchs keen to emphasise their Christian values.</p> <p>But their biggest selling point is the impressive claims they make for curbing reoffending. Although about two-thirds of offenders go on to commit further offences, the group claims that Jesus can save not just fallen souls, but, crucially, taxpayers' cash.</p> <p>One notable example is the Kainos Community, which operates in three prisons - the Verne in Dorset, Swaleside on the Isle of Sheppey and Stocken in Rutland. Operated by committed Christians, the group, which has been running for more than a decade, makes some dramatic claims for turning around the lives of even the most hardened of criminals. According to Kainos - which claims that its statistics are independently verified by academics - only 13 per cent of the serious offenders who complete its courses go on to reoffend after two years, compared with 35 per cent across the prison service average.</p> <p>Kainos, which is keen to play a greater role in Britain's prison system, enjoys a powerful position in the prisons in which it operates. Each jail gives over an entire wing to the community, which runs them on strict lines. Inmates sleep in dormitories and are given intensive cognitive behaviour therapy through classes in relationships, interpersonal skills and citizenship. On the wing the men live together, discuss their problems together and solve them together. The emphasis is on finding a common solution through empathy and discussion. </p> <p>Those offenders who want to be involved have to sign up to a minimum six-month programme and those who complete it are often kept on as mentors. When it started at the Verne, few were convinced that it could have an impact. But things quickly changed. 'In nine months we went from running what was known as the Beirut wing to a quiet, compliant wing,' said Patricia Rogers, chief executive of Kainos.</p> <p>Imported from a Christian-based group in Brazil, where it had helped to transform entire prisons, the organisation's religious emphasis has been toned down in recent years. </p> <p>But Rogers admits that faith is the key driver behind Kainos's operation. 'You won't see the word God used, but as an organisation we believe people can change, and that comes from our faith,' she said. </p> <p>Rogers admits many of the men end up being drawn to Christianity as a result of the programme. The organisation's website bears testimony to its apparent success. 'You have made me so happy today, and God bless for that and for everything that you teach me at Kainos,' one offender writes on the website. 'Coming to this community was the best possible thing that happened in my life.'</p> <p>Myriad Christian organisations operating in the UK prison system recount similar success stories. The Salvation Army operates a network of prison chaplains and claims many prisoners have benefited from its activities. The Daylight Christian Trust, a conservative evangelical group, runs a prison visitor and letter writing programme and has distributed 170,000 copies of its Scripture diaries across the UK's jails. </p> <p>The Prison Fellowship has more than 120 local prison prayer groups and 900 volunteers from all Christian denominations. It claims to have achieved a 'significant improvement' in victim empathy for prisoners who took part in one of its specialist programmes.</p> <p>Meanwhile, more than 50,000 prisoners have attended Alpha, the popular Christian course that operates in 80 per cent of the UK's jails. The Attorney General, Baroness Scotland, has even praised Alpha's work, while its website carries scores of quotes from prisoners who claim their lives have been transformed by the course. </p> <p>'In being a part of the course I now have a new understanding of what God expects from us and how we should live as one of his children in Christ,' one inmate writes.</p> <p>Given current trends, some believe that the UK will follow the lead of the United States, where fundamental Christian groups pay hundreds of thousands of dollars to open centres in privately run prisons where they can promote their beliefs.</p> <p>'We are in crisis,' the US-based Christian Prison Ministries explains in response to questions about why it is spending huge sums of money going into the country's prisons. 'Our nation is hurting. We need anything and everything that will work.' </p> <p>The Prison Fellowship, set up by Chuck Colson - an adviser to US President Richard Nixon - who was jailed for obstruction of justice, makes startling claims for curbing reoffending rates and has become a powerful advocate of faith-based intervention programmes in the US. </p> <p>The organisation has flourished in states such as Florida, Texas and Georgia since President George W Bush outlined his 'faith-based agenda'- a plan to cure the United States's social ills through the expansion of religious ministries.</p> <p>'The role of government is limited because government cannot put hope in people's hearts or a sense of purpose in people's lives,' Bush said when asked about his enthusiasm for mixing religion and justice.</p> <p>But the increasing power of Christian prison ministries has attracted controversy in the US for blurring the lines between church and state. Their claims for curbing recidivism are also open to debate. Similarly a backlash is now brewing in the UK. The activities of some faith-based groups operating in prisons here are starting to alarm those who work with offenders. </p> <p>Napo, the probation officers' union, has written to MPs raising concerns about the work of a group called the Modern Jesus Army. The union says that it is worried that the organisation has been writing to a group of sex offenders in Hull prison offering them prayers and support in the final months of their sentences. Once out of jail, the offenders undergo a baptism and are born again. </p> <p>'In probation officers' experience, confronting offending behaviour becomes extremely difficult, if not impossible, after the individual has converted,' said Harry Fletcher, Napo's assistant general secretary.</p> <p>There are questions, too, about the way some groups target prisoners and preach a conservative interpretation of the Bible that claims homosexuality is a sin. </p> <p>'We are concerned at the promulgation of any extremism in prisons, regardless of religious persuasion,' said Frances Crook, director of the Howard League for Penal Reform. 'These groups are targeting what is literally a captive audience and exploiting very vulnerable people when they are at their lowest.'</p> <p>Crook believes the growing influence of faith groups in the criminal justice system is a result of unprecedented pressures now being placed on prisons. 'What you have to understand is the lamentable provision of official counselling and support offered by the prison service, which is only exacerbated by overcrowding,' she said. 'No one cares unless you are trying to place yourself on the end of a rope. It is small wonder faith groups are on the rise in our jails.'</p> <p>There are also concerns that some groups exploit their position by offering de facto incentives to potential converts. 'Participation in these groups can often mean extra time out of cells and attendance on their courses can be a favourable factor at parole hearings,' said Keith Porteous Wood, executive director of the National Secular Society. 'This means non-Christians and non-believers may have to pretend to be interested to get the privileges that these courses bring. I have yet to see any reliable evidence that they have any effect on recidivism.' </p> <p>He warned that the growing role of organised religion within jails was in danger of inflaming tensions within the prison system. </p> <p>'Whole wings of some prisons are controlled by religious organisations, providing a much more comfortable existence for those willing to submit to the evangelising process,' Porteous Wood said. 'This is painfully far from the concept of every citizen being treated equally under the law and resentment is sure to follow from other religious groups that are vying for control in jails.'</p> <p>Certainly other faiths are showing an increasing interest in building up a following among prisoners. Several jails in the UK have entire wings now dominated by Muslim gangs and most have a visiting imam. </p> <p>Nor is it just organised religion that is taking an active interest in saving the prison system's lost souls. Documents obtained by The Observer under Freedom of Information legislation reveal that the Church of Scientology has attempted to introduce its Criminon programme, which it claims can dramatically reduce reoffending rates, into Britain's jails, but so far to no avail. </p> <p>Recognising the increasing plurality of beliefs of offenders, the Prison Service is now promoting a more multi-faith agenda. The move has provoked controversy, with several Christian organisations closing down their activities, complaining that a culture of political correctness is stifling their work.</p> <p>But countless other Christian groups are ready to fill the gap. Given that the incarcerated population is at record levels and rehabilitation and education courses are being pared back, the church's role in Britain's jails can only become more powerful. No one else wants the job.</p> <h2>Around the world</h2> <p><strong>United States</strong></p> <p>The Supreme Court decrees that prison inmates retain a number of constitutional rights, including access to religion. About 38 per cent of inmates participate in religious programmes run weekly by more than 30 faith groups. </p> <p><strong>Brazil</strong></p> <p>Most prisoners are nominally Catholic and the Prison Ministry of the Catholic Church has local representatives who visit jails regularly. Protestant and African Brazilian denominations are also active in the prisons. A study of two prisons - one operated by a religious group, the other by a secular organisation - found that the religious prison had a 16 per cent recidivism rate compared with 36 per cent for the secular prison.</p> <p><strong>New Zealand</strong></p> <p>A prison near the capital, Wellington, uses prayer and spiritual transformation to reduce reoffending. The Faith-Based Unit at Rimutaka Prison is the first of its kind in Australasia and claims its approach has stopped many from going back to crime. </p> <p><strong>Singapore</strong></p> <p>A pilot project run by Prison Fellowship International has started in Changi Prison. The 24/7 regimes aim to reduce offending through character-focused, faith-based programming.</p> <p><strong>Uganda</strong></p> <p>A prisons outreach ministry has been credited with reducing reoffending rates in parts of the country.</p>",
  "<p>I thought John Prescott was bound to shout at me, if not throw punches. He has a history of bullying women journalists - he gave my colleague Rachel Cooke a hard time and once actually summoned the Times's Mary Ann Sieghart to his office so he could shout at her. Given that I recently reviewed his autobiography, Prezza, with something less than rapture, I fully expected to get the same treatment - he might conceivably have resented the description 'bog-standard illiterate bruiser'. But actually he had a great beaming smile stitched to his face almost the whole time I was with him; I found it disconcerting. Something else I found disconcerting was the habit first recorded by Rachel Cooke. When she met him, he hoiked one leg over the arm of his chair so that what she politely called his 'pelvis' was pointing at her like a gun. She said it was like a Desmond Morris seminar on mating. I assumed he did it because he fancied Rachel, but then he did exactly the same with me. He looked so uncomfortable, I wanted to say, 'There, there, you've shown us your impressive manhood - now sit up straight.'</p> <p>His office at the House of Commons is the sort of den any schoolboy would envy. One whole table is covered with model ships and planes, there is a line of model trains on the window ledge, and paintings of the cruise liners he worked on around the walls. There are also pictures of Ernest Bevin and Clem Attlee, a statuette of Nye Bevan, another of a miner - I think if you saw the room on Through the Keyhole you might guess it was Prescott's. He proudly shows me a tiny paper cup that was taken from the wreck of the Titanic - the water pressure reduced it to thimble size. He seems absolutely determined to be friendly.</p> <p>But, of course, he has something to plug, a new two-part BBC documentary called Prescott on Class. Despite the unenticing title, I loved it. What makes it great is not so much Prezza, who bangs on predictably about being working class, but Pauline, his wife, who is completely lovely and will have television producers beating a path to her door. (Prezza says a few have already tried, but she's not interested.) At one point she and Prezza go to meet a genuine toff, the Earl of Onslow, and Pauline giggles to the camera about whether it's all right to tell a Lord his flies are undone. At home in Hull, she shows us her famous downstairs loo that she was having installed just when the Tracey Temple scandal broke. Prezza got warning that the tabloids were about to run the story of his affair and dashed home to Hull to tell Pauline - she was hurt not only by his infidelity but also by the fact Tracey was someone she regarded as a friend. He said they must do a moonlight flit to Dorneywood, his ministerial retreat in Buckinghamshire, because the house would be surrounded by paparazzi in the morning. Oh no, she said, she'd got the builders coming to do her new loo, and no way would she abandon that; so she stayed at home with the builders and he went off to Dorneywood alone. Later she had a party to unveil the new loo - 'It was like Clochemerle,' says Prezza. Actually, says Pauline, it is not polite to call it a loo, or a toilet; the new posh word is 'lavatory'. Unlike Prezza, she seems to have no rancour about class, but regards it as a bit of a joke. And she reveals that actually, Prescott's family was quite posh by her standards, because they lived in a semi-detached whereas she lived in a terrace.</p> <p>Prezza's class chip is really weird - how can he keep whingeing on about being 'disadvantaged' when he was deputy prime minister for 10 years? What does he think he would have been if he'd been born into the middle class? Prime minister? King? He says it all started with him failing the 11 plus - his father promised him a bike if he passed, but then he didn't get it and it rankled. I think actually what he resents is his lack of education. He left school at 16 with no qualifications, but then became a ship's steward and organiser for the National Union of Seamen. They eventually sponsored him to go to Ruskin College, Oxford, then to Hull University. So he did get an education, but a late one. He says in his autobiography that his two years at Oxford were the happiest of his life - although he also says he worked so desperately hard he never even visited the other colleges. But perhaps Oxford gave him a vision of the sort of gilded student life he might have enjoyed if he had only passed the 11 plus. </p> <p>He hates it when people laugh about his appalling English. He was furious when Simon Hoggart compiled a whole book of Prescottisms, some of which he claims Hoggart made up, though he admits to uttering the immortal, 'The green belt is a Labour achievement and we intend to build on it.' His TV producer cunningly brought him face to face with Hoggart at the Hay Book Festival and Hoggart told him in a kindly spirit that his problem was he spoke too fast, so his words tumbled over each other. But, actually, I noticed another problem with Prescott and language. While I was with him, I thought that, though much of what he said was boring, I had no trouble understanding it. But when I came to transcribe the tape, there were whole paragraphs - nay, pages - I had to jettison as completely unintelligible. I'd understood him while he was talking, but his words made no sense on the page. So whereas I would never normally alter a quote, with Prescott I have had to carve a path through the thickets of verbiage to convey what I hope was his meaning.</p> <p>I started by saying that although I didn't like his book much, I loved his television programme. Typically, he ignored the compliment and picked up on the criticism. 'What didn't you like about the book?'</p> <p>'I thought it was pretty shallow. How long did you spend on it?' 'Well, not very long. But what did you want from the book? I'll tell you what I wanted from the book. [Typical again - he asks a question, doesn't wait for the answer.] I think I've done quite a few things in my time - not that the press have ever given me credit for it - and I wanted to put that on record, so that was quite useful. And I did have a life before politics which I wanted to put in. And it was to correct some of the image that's painted of me by the press. I assume I've confirmed some of the image, for instance, putting up two fingers outside Number 10 - people can say you shouldn't be deputy prime minister and do that kind of thing, and if you've got the view that perhaps I'm not an ordinary kind of guy, perhaps you might be offended by that.'</p> <p>Mmm. Anyway, I reminded him, I did enjoy the television programme. There is a hilarious scene when Prezza is taken to meet three chavs, and asks the producer en route what chav means. She defines it as meaning 'council house and violent' (news to me) but anyway, the girls he meets say they're not chavs, they're middle-class. 'You can't call me working class,' says one unanswerably, 'Cos I don't work.' Prezza is sweetly puzzled by these girls, who run rings round him intellectually, but what is impressive is his desire to understand them. He really wants to get to the bottom of their problems. One of them says she got kicked out of school for violence. 'Someone attacked you?' he asks. No, she explains patiently, she attacked the teacher.</p> <p>The only reason the girls knew who Prezza was is because they saw him on television punching a man who threw an egg at him which, of course, they admired. Prezza in his autobiography seems to regard the punch as his finest hour, though he had a good whinge to me about how this 40-second incident seemed to be the only thing anyone remembered out of his 40-year career. I tried to explain that perhaps it sets a bad example to the young for the deputy prime minister to go round throwing punches - it might for instance lead to 14-year-old girls thinking it was OK to hit teachers. 'Hang on, hang on. What am I supposed to do then - take the belt? Some of the sisters [Harriet Harman and co] took that view down here.'</p> <p>'I agree with them.'</p> <p>'Well I think you're probably one of the sisters then. What would you do if you got belted by a fella?'</p> <p>'Scream. Call the police. Certainly not hit him.'</p> <p>'Would you not defend yourself? You'd just stand there and take it like Jesus Christ or something? Well I don't. I do what I did. You can smile like Tony if you like and walk on by but that's not me, I'm sorry. I've lived my life where I have to defend myself. At sea, if you didn't defend yourself you were in real trouble. When six men came attacking me, am I supposed to say, \"I'm sorry, I don't believe in violence\"? </p> <p>I said to Blair, \"If an ordinary guy had done this, what would you have said?\" And he said, \"But you're not an ordinary guy, you're the deputy prime minister.\" To which I said, \"Can't an ordinary guy be DPM?\" I said: \"If that's the case, then take it off me. I don't want it.\" That's the way I am.'</p> <p>Cue violins - I'm surprised he doesn't break into a rendition of 'My Way'. A lot of what he blames on class - like the fact that Blair almost never invited him to dinner at Number 10 or Chequers - I think has a much simpler explanation. You wouldn't want to invite Prezza to dinner not because he might eat peas with his knife, but because he would bore the other guests to death. When he starts on one of his needy, self-pitying rants about class, there is absolutely no deflecting him. Moreover, his vision of class, where downtrodden salt-of-the-earth mill hands groan under the lash of wicked heartless mill owners, bears no relation to modern Britain. All his ideas seem to derive from three texts he read at Ruskin College in the Sixties - Karl Marx, of course, but also Richard Hoggart's The Uses of Literacy and Michael Young's The Rise of the Meritocracy, both of which date from the Fifties. He doesn't seem to have noticed that society has changed since then. He still imagines the working class saving up for their annual Wakes Week trip to Blackpool; it is left to the Earl of Onslow in the TV programme to break it to him that nowadays his gamekeeper takes holidays in South Africa.</p> <p>He says he enjoyed making the programme but he wouldn't want to do it again. 'I'm not a Michael Portillo. I don't want another career. But I was interested in the idea of doing something on class, and I think people might see me as a different personality to the perception that is put across by the media. Did you find that by watching it?'</p> <p>'Oh yes - you seemed more human.'</p> <p>'Well I think I am that. The press always knock me because I don't have a great deal of time for them. They know they're not going to get any stories out of me so that makes it easy for them to be abusive. I'll probably be a bit abusive as well.'</p> <p>Yes, I said, he was incredibly abusive to Mary Ann Sieghart. 'I'm glad you mentioned that, I felt quite strong about her. Here is a woman who believed that I should not be the deputy prime minister because I could not get my English right! She said that to me! She writes all this abusive stuff - she's never even met me. Can you be violent in words? Yes you can. Words can do as much damage as a punch can do, quite frankly. So I asked her to come and meet me and I said, \"Look, you might have a point that I don't get the language right, but perhaps you might credit that I've done some things that are good in my life. But because the language doesn't come right, you think the brain doesn't work or something. And I just think you're wrong.\" But she just maintained her position - she's a bloody snob.'</p> <p>The danger with having a class bias as pronounced as Prescott's is that it can skew your judgement of other people - you might automatically trust people who sound working class and distrust people who sound posh. Does he do that? </p> <p>'I hope not. I would say I tend to trust people until I find I have reason not to. I do think that people who speak with a certain accent and in that loud way - because what private education does is give you confidence above all else - I notice that I'm a bit more wary of them, because of the values I think come with that. But I still work with them. I don't say, \"Because you're from that background, I can't work with you.\"'</p> <p>This was always his strength as deputy prime minister - he was a brilliant negotiator who managed to keep the Old Labour unionists on board while Blair and Brown were pushing through their New Labour reforms. He also, he claims, played marriage guidance counsellor whenever Blair and Brown were on the brink of divorce. Nowadays he speaks very warmly of Brown and his handling of the financial crisis. He also speaks warmly of Blair, though he hasn't even seen him since he resigned. How does he feel about the return of Peter Mandelson? 'Next question.' Did he remonstrate with Gordon Brown? 'He's the prime minister; he makes his decisions; I won't be saying anything.'</p> <p>Prezza leaves parliament at the next election. 'I've done my bit. Not very successfully from your assessment, but I've done 10 years, I was very privileged to have it, and very, very privileged to work with two great guys, Blair and Brown, to play a part in the party's development. I think we've had 10 years of the most successful government for a long time. Where I will play a part, of course, as I am doing now, is to make sure that we can win a fourth term. I owe everything I have to the Labour party and the Labour movement - everything I have was given to me by them - so the least I can do is make sure I do whatever I can to assist in keeping them in government.'</p> <p>Will he go to the House of Lords? 'My wife would like me to. I'm scared to death of doing nothing. But I need to be convinced I can still do something inside the political system. And I like the Council of Europe work I do, there's a lot of environment things I'm doing over there, so I want to carry on with that. I just wonder if you cut yourself off from the Commons, are you finished? I'm not a guy for looking around for a place on a board, but I do want to continue being active.' I bet we'll end up with the spectacle of Lord Prescott in ermine banging on about how his working-class origins have held him back.</p> <p>Oh, his class chip is a bore! More than half the people I interview come from working-class or disadvantaged backgrounds and I have never, ever heard anyone whinge on about it the way Prescott does. Once he starts, he just won't stop, and the only way you can bring it to a conclusion is to say, 'There, there, Mr Prescott, despite your terrible class handicaps you were the longest-serving deputy prime minister in British history, which must prove something or other about social mobility.' (Actually, I think what it mainly proves is Tony Blair's extraordinary patience, but it would be unhelpful to say so.) The line 'longest-serving deputy prime minister' seems to act on Prescott like a dose of Calpol on a baby, and then he quietens down and says, as if the idea is occurring to him for the very first time, that it's true, he has come a very long way.</p> <p>'Tony always used to say to me, \"The trouble with you, John, is you don't recognise you're the prime minister.\" [Presumably he said deputy prime minister.] Well, if that's the trouble, I don't think I've changed. All my seamen guys from the old Britannic, who I meet every year, say I've not changed. I take some pride in that. I'm still the same JP. And I think that's an achievement, not to have been, I think, spoiled by the system.' It's true that the one virtue of Prescott's chippiness is that at least he isn't smug or pompous, like so many politicians. But given a choice between chippiness and pomposity I'd say it's a bit of a toss-up.</p> <p>'I was on the QE2 this week,' he muses. 'They asked me as an ex-Cunarder to take the pennant of the ship in Liverpool cathedral and pass it to the Lord Mayor. They're proud of me as a Cunarder. So I joined her at Liverpool and went up to Scotland. And I was sitting having breakfast as we were coming up the Clyde and remembering exactly 50 years ago when I was on a ship called the Franconia that used to call at Clyde, but in those days I was serving the meal, not sitting there being served. And it made me think of the point you've made about coming a long way and I think you're right. But on that same ship I couldn't go down to the restaurant and walk in on my own - I still can't do that. I can walk on a stage and talk to 1,000 people, but I can't walk into a restaurant and stand there looking for a seat, I get too embarrassed. I think it's an inferiority built in me which I have to admit to, which has led me to react so strongly to people I identify as public school twits. I wish I had their education! The journalist Julia Langdon many years ago gave me a book on English and said, \"Try and learn.\" But I never had time to do that. And I think that has given me a burn on my side that has led to some of the resentment, and then it gets connected to failing the 11 plus and right through. But I think it's a valid criticism that I should have had more confidence in where I'd arrived.'</p> <p>\u2022 Prescott: The Class System and Me is on BBC2 on October 27 at 9pm</p>",
  "<h2>NU wrote off my car. Then they decided they'd try to repair it ...</h2> <p>My Mazda MX-5 was stolen last November. It was found shortly before Christmas, after being involved in a high-speed police chase, and was severely damaged. Two days earlier I had been offered a settlement figure by Norwich Union (NU) but, because the insurance was in my wife's name and she was working abroad at the time, NU had to wait for her to agree the amount.</p> <p>Instead, as the car had now been found, NU undertook to have it repaired. Several months later, it was returned in an unsatisfactory condition and, after discussion with NU, was returned to the garage where more work was carried out. When it was again returned, it would not start and had to sit on the road. I paid for it to be towed to another garage and paid separately for a new alternator, battery and door locking system.</p> <p>At the end of May, NU agreed to further repairs as it was still unsafe to drive. Currently the car is in a Mazda garage which has been waiting four weeks to hear from NU. The complaints manager there no longer returns our calls. Approaching the anniversary of the theft, I still have no car and have been paying premiums for a car I have not been able to drive.<br><strong>JM, London</strong></p> <p><strong>Margaret:</strong> What a trail of incompetence. Complaints managers should have a fail-safe system and refer complaints higher up if they feel they can't cope. They can always send you a 'deadlock letter', which means they have investigated as far as they can go and allows you to take your problem to the Financial Ombudsman Service. They should never simply ignore you.</p> <p>Norwich Union has now shown your problem to its in-house engineer. He immediately concluded that no one should ever have authorised repairs to your car in the first place. It was clearly a write-off and you should have been paid for it immediately. The insurer says it understands how frustrating the past year has been for you - having to keep returning the car to the garage and provide yourself with another vehicle to drive. It has now come to an agreement. It is giving you \u00a39,500 for the car, which is the write-off value at the time it was stolen and which you have accepted. It is adding \u00a3160 for the road tax you've had to pay, \u00a3100 towards taxis and other out-of-pocket expenses and \u00a3500 compensation for making such a mess of your claim.</p> <h2>Apparently, my wife isn't good enough for my bank</h2> <p>My wife and I have spent half the year in Sandwich, Kent, for the past five years, always staying at the same rental unit. Our main residence is in the US and we are retired US citizens. I have had a Nationwide FlexAccount since 2003 and never been overdrawn. In August, we asked our local Nationwide branch to add my wife to my FlexAccount. She proved her identity using her US passport and her address with a letter from the landlord's agent. This satisfied the branch, which sent the paperwork to head office.</p> <p>But Nationwide has refused to add my wife to the account as she is not registered on the voters' roll in Sandwich. This is its final decision.<br><strong>RW, Sandwich</strong></p> <p><strong>Margaret:</strong> When you opened your accounts, Nationwide allowed non-UK nationals to become customers but it has since changed this rule, as have other banks. It has looked at your wife's application again and this time agreed that indeed she can become a joint account holder with you. That is the only logical decision it could reach.</p> <h2>Why can't National Grid just post my dividends to me? </h2> <p>Capita Tracing Solutions wrote to tell me I had \u00a3282 in unclaimed dividends from National Grid but that I must pay 15 per cent, \u00a342, before it will forward the difference to me. I fail to understand why National Grid has not sent me this amount in full since I have lived at my present address for 12 years.<br><strong>BMcD, Sunderland</strong></p> <p><strong>Margaret:</strong> National Grid has more than one million shareholders and says it cannot economically check that every dividend cheque has been cashed. So it employs Capita to find missing shareholders, something that few companies with large shareholder lists do. But you do not have to use Capita. You can contact National Grid directly for the money.</p> <p>The mystery is why you didn't receive the dividends in the first place. National Grid has found four outstanding dividend cheques and another five from its predecessor, BG plc. It reissues uncashed cheques worth under \u00a330 free but charges \u00a312 for cheques over \u00a330 and \u00a315 for any over \u00a3100, even though it takes no extra effort to rewrite a large cheque than a small one.</p> <p>All but two of your cheques are under \u00a330. One is over \u00a330 and the other over \u00a3100, which means you have to pay \u00a327 to get the dividends. National Grid has checked that it was writing to your correct address, so will not waive the fee, but at least it is cheaper than paying \u00a342 to Capita.</p> <h2>Barclays can't explain why I've paid out \u00a3141</h2> <p>I told Barclays Bank that there was a \u00a3141 standing order in my account for Eagle Securities, a firm with whom I had never had any contact. I asked to see the original form setting up the standing order but the bank has no such document in its files. Apparently 15 months is too long for the bank to keep the document.</p> <p>Barclays suggests I take this up with the Financial Ombudsman Service, but if my bank of 55 years cannot prove that it had proper authority to make payments totalling \u00a3705 from my account, it should refund the money and take it up with the beneficiary of this standing order.<br><strong>SA, Leicester</strong></p> <p><strong>Margaret:</strong> Barclays promptly cancelled the standing order and refunded \u00a3705. It keeps standing order instructions for only 13 months as it believes this is long enough for any queries to arise. Rather than fraud, the bank believes that either the person setting up the standing order gave your account number by mistake or someone in the bank wrote it down wrongly.</p> <p>\u2022 Email Margaret Dibben at <a href=\"mailto:money.writes@observer.co.uk\">money.writes@observer.co.uk</a> or write to Margaret Dibben, Money Writes, The Observer, 3-7 Herbal Hill, London EC1R 5EJ and include a telephone number.

  "<p>Nanni Moretti usually stars in angrily playful films, written and directed by himself, that look at the Italian political scene from a sceptical left-wing point of view. Seven years ago, however, he set aside the public aspect of his work and deservedly won the Palme d'Or at Cannes for The Son's Room, playing a psychoanalyst, head of a middle-class family in Ancona, trying to cope with the death of a beloved teenage son. </p> <p>Now in <strong>Quiet Chaos</strong>, under the direction of Antonello Grimaldi, he plays a similar character grieving for his wife in an adaptation of Sandro Veronesi's bestselling novel. Whereas the son dies halfway through the earlier film, in Quiet Chaos, the 43-year-old Pietro's wife is seen only after her death, having collapsed in the garden of the family's seaside villa. Her husband and his brother discover her body when returning from the beach where, with supreme irony, they've saved the lives of two drowning women, only to have their heroic deeds ignored. </p> <p>Pietro is left to care for a 10-year-old daughter, Claudia, and after taking her to her exclusive school for the first day of the autumn term, he decides to remain protectively in an adjoining park rather than return to his job as a senior executive with an international film company. He keeps up this absence for the rest of the year, as he attempts to understand his feelings and remain outside a bitter conflict within his firm about a merger. </p> <p>This being a neatly tailored study of what might be called designer-grief, his self-indulgent actions not merely go uncriticised but attract the respect of his troubled colleagues who one by one come to consult him in the park.</p> <p>Meanwhile, he becomes a fixture of the local scene. He waves daily to a cheerful Down's syndrome child and to a lovely young girl walking a St Bernard, becomes a respected habitue of the park's cafe, is asked in for lunch by a local widower, has an intimate conversation with his brother and meets other parents and his neurotic sister-in-law (Valeria Golino). </p> <p>The climactic visitors are the charismatic Jewish boss of a German company involved in the merger (this gets a gasp from the audience as it's a cameo by Roman Polanski) and the rich woman whose life he saved, an encounter that leads to some graphic sex.</p> <p>While these troubled folk come to consult Pietro as if he were a sage dispensing advice from a cave in the Himalayas, the 10-year-old Claudia, a preternaturally articulate and wise child, is being taught by an adoring teacher about palindromes and the difference between reversible and irreversible. At the end, she puts Dad on the road to acceptance and recovery. I enjoyed this movie, partly because of the lovely autumnal ambience and Moretti's easy charm. But during all the fancy emblematic talk about palindromes, the word 'glib' came to mind which, if read backwards, is almost 'bilge', which is what I ended up thinking about Quiet Chaos</p>",
  "<p>Tim Adams's seven-page outpouring on the grey squirrel 'menace' (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/oct/19/red-squirrels-protection\">'They shoot squirrels, don't they?'</a>, Magazine, last week) was a spectacular example of ignorance, bigotry and historical amnesia. Grey squirrels were introduced into Britain 130 years ago as an ornamental species. They flourished because they are sturdy and readily adapt to a rapidly changing, man-managed environment. Red numbers have dropped drastically because, like the grey today, they were killed over generations, after being accused of taking birds' eggs and damaging forestry.</p> <p>Now the grey is the villain and the red is eulogised. On the charge sheet against the grey is that he destroys red populations by passing on the deadly parapox virus. In fact, red numbers have periodically crashed because of other disease epidemics at a time when the grey wasn't present. As for parapox, news this month indicates that the red is developing immune resistance.<br><strong>Kate Fowler-Reeves</strong><br>Head of Campaigns, Animal Aid,<br>Tonbridge, Kent</p> <p>In outlining his efforts to eradicate grey squirrels, Lord Redesdale describes the Northumberland Wildlife Trust and the Save Our Squirrels project as sitting on the fence by not embracing the killing of grey squirrels. But the Northumberland Wildlife Trust and its partners have never shied away from this; we have been encouraging and carrying out control of greys for years. The difference between our approach and that of Lord Redesdale and his Red Squirrel Protection Partnership, which we supported in their original funding bid, is that we are strategic, aiming what little resource for this work we can muster at important areas where reds will survive longest. This will help their long-term survival, not killing greys throughout England.</p> <p>While it makes good press, Lord Redesdale's vigilante approach is counter to the best interests of the red. We no longer support his efforts as we disapprove of the way the Red Squirrel Protection Partnership is carrying out this work with public funds. They have, indeed, become, in his words, conservation 'cowboys'.<br><strong>Mike Pratt</strong><br>Chief Executive, Northumberland Wildlife Trust; <br>director, Save Our Squirrels Project<br>Newcastle upon Tyne</p> <p>The main threat to red squirrels is the destruction of their oak, hazel and Scots pine forest habitat by humans.

There is no species in Britain that hasn't 'invaded' from abroad at some point.

  "<p>Richard Phillips, co-owner of toiletries maker The Soap Kitchen, insists that business is holding up, despite Gordon Brown finally uttering the 'R' word - recession - last week. His company, in Torrington, Devon, employs six full-time staff and sells the raw ingredients used in toiletries, such as essential oils, to high-street health and beauty shops. Typically, October is his busiest month, as his customers stock up ahead of Christmas. Despite a couple of unseasonably quiet trading days this month, sales are on target, he says. </p> <p>What is really worrying him is his company's \u00a325,000 overdraft, which comes up for renewal in June. For a company turning over \u00a3300,000 a year, it's not a huge amount. But, like thousands of other small firms, he doesn't know if his bank will slash his overdraft allowance overnight - or charge him much more to keep it. </p> <p>'It's worrying if you keep moving the goalposts. We work within certain parameters and have already seen an increase in commodity prices,' he says. </p> <p>His fears are not unfounded. Steve Sharratt, vice-chairman of the SME (small and medium sized enterprise) council of the Confederation of British Industry, says: 'The really scary thing is that banks have shut up shop. SMEs are typically not run with a big wodge of cash on their balance sheet.'</p> <p>The plight of The Soap Kitchen seems a world away from the near-collapse of the banking sector and the City. In fact, Phillips's firm - and thousands like it - are already feeling the effects of the credit crunch. Even after the government's \u00a3400bn bail-out, banks continue to hoard cash in an effort to shore up their balance sheets. As a result, lending to businesses has been slashed, leaving firms with the smallest balance sheets most at risk of running out of cash.</p> <p>There are an estimated 4.5 million SMEs such as The Soap Kitchen, employing 250 people or fewer, in the UK. Together they account for 13.5 million workers - half the total UK workforce. The government seems finally to have woken up to the importance, and vulnerability, of such firms: on Thursday, Chancellor Alistair Darling and Business Secretary Peter Mandelson hauled the bosses of Britain's biggest banks into the Treasury. </p> <p>As part of this month's banking bail-out, the government is demanding that the banks make the same level of borrowing available to businesses as they did last year. What is not clear is whether, even if this happens, small firms will be able to afford the level of interest the banks are likely to charge.</p> <p>The government announced it was reviving the 'Small Business Forum', which was disbanded five years ago, to monitor bank lending levels. Chaired by Mandelson and comprised of the big banks and small business organisations, it meets for the first time in a fortnight. </p> <p>Stephen Alambritis, spokesman for the Federation of Small Businesses, said it would hold the banks to account at the forum meetings if - as has happened in the past - local managers do not follow head office rulings to loosen the purse strings at affordable rates. 'All the pledges on lending will amout to nothing if branch managers remain a law unto themselves,' he warned.</p> <p>Small firms are not just being squeezed by the banks, but by big business too. Research from the Credit Management Research Centre (CMRC) at Leeds University Business School shows that companies keen to hang on to their cash as long as possible, are taking longer to settle their bills - particularly if they owe money to small firms. In the second quarter of this year, SMEs were already suffering a longer wait for payment - about 20 days overdue - compared with larger companies, which on average had to wait an extra 10 days to get their money. Delays have since got worse. </p> <p>Corinne Frydman is the director of Webwide Translations, a translating service based in Harpenden, Hertfordshire, with a full-time staff of two. She is optimistic about her company's prospects, but concerned that many of her clients - large blue-chip companies - are not paying up. </p> <p>'Even if the client is a huge company, we try to get our money as quickly as possible, for example by negotiating short payment periods,' she says.</p> <p>Nick Wilson, professor of credit and finance at the CMRC, says that smaller firms often find it hard to force their larger customers to keep to the agreed payment terms. 'The suppliers rarely make a legal challenge to try to impose interest charges on late payments,' he says. And he points out that small firms' clients can dispute the terms set out with the supplier in the invoice, the quality of the goods or after-sales service. 'The suppliers would argue that the bigger companies use the threat of such challenges as a pretext to delay payment,' he says.</p> <p>In this way, simple cash-flow problems - caused by the double whammy of banks cutting lending and clients delaying payment - could cause thousands of small firms to go bankrupt, even if their businesses are otherwise healthy. </p> <p>It is not clear that government pressure alone on the banks to get them lending to small firms will be enough without regulation. Certainly, there is the risk that the 'small business forum' becomes little more than a talking shop if banks face no punishment for restricting lending levels.</p> <p>Banks certainly have form. In 2002, the government backed a report from the Competition Commission which accused the Big Four banks of making \u00a32.2bn excess profits by overcharging small businesses. The government has to make sure the banks don't shirk their responsibilities this time before small firms join the growing list of casualties of the crunch.</p>",

  "<p>A plant popular in garden ponds faces a sales ban in Britain amid fears that it could devastate wetlands, choke waterways and increase the risk of flooding.</p> <p>Water primrose - or Ludwigia - is out of control in rivers and canals in France, and Belgium and the Netherlands are also spending hundreds of thousands of pounds battling the alien invader, originally from South America.</p> <p>At least six sites of infestation have been identified in southern England and Wales, including at the Wildfowl and Wetland Trust's centre in London, according to the Environment Agency.</p> <p>Now the government is considering banning its sale, and gardeners are warned to be extremely vigilant about preventing further escape into the wild.</p> <p>Trevor Renals, invasive species adviser at the EA, said the plant's ability to double its biomass in 15-20 days, and the dense matting it forms above and below the water, made it 'a profound threat and potentially devastating for our wetlands, with all the implications for breeding birds and native species'.</p> <p>Environmentalists now hope that Defra will agree an amendment to the Wildlife and Countryside Act under which water primrose cannot be introduced to the wild without a licence.</p>",
  "<p>No\u00ebl Coward would, I'm sure, be horrified by many of the modern forms of communication. I can't imagine him being fluent in textspeak, for instance (No\u00ebl Coward, author of The 4tex and Hay Feva, doesn't look quite right). The immediacy of email would dilute such carefully thought-out witticisms as: 'I like long walks, especially when they are taken by people who annoy me.' On Facebook, however, he would be in his element, accepting 'friend' requests at the rate of several hundred a day. </p> <p>One of the most striking things about Barry Day's sensitively edited collection of Coward's letters is the realisation that the playwright made friends like other people make noise. He kept up these friendships over decades, shooting off epigrammatic letters with astonishing regularity, sometimes even writing to people he disliked in order to charm them into submission (Graham Greene, an early critic of Coward's plays, was sent a retaliatory letter in verse: 'I know a few/ Politer critics than yourself/ Who simply hate my lighter plays/ But do they state their sharp dispraise/ With such surprising, rising bile?/ Oh dear me no, they merely smile.')</p> <p>His correspondents included Laurence Olivier, Virginia Woolf, Ian Fleming, TE Lawrence and Lord Mountbatten and his letters gloss delightfully over some of the most important events of the 20th century. During the Second World War, he was recruited by spymaster Bill Stephenson: 'My disguise would be my own reputation as a bit of an idiot.' </p> <p>The correspondence drips with panache, but is occasionally stifled by Coward's penchant for deliberately not taking things seriously. There are more 'Darlingests' here than you can shake an orchestral baton at. When news of the Profumo affair broke, Coward wrote to Jack Profumo's wife, actress Valerie Hobson: 'I said that although I didn't know the ins and outs of the situation etc', and then added in brackets: 'Perhaps this could have been more happily put!'</p> <p>Yet for all this, Coward's letters remain peepholes into a gilded age. Each page is full of comedic vignettes that sparkle with shards of his lethal perception. And on top of that, he also makes you giggle.</p>",
  "<p>When Peter Mandelson was ennobled recently, one lord was reported to have described his new peer as 'a quintessential Jew'. It isn't clear whether or not that was meant as a compliment. Let's assume not. Mandelson is not Jewish in any way orthodox believers, or most other people, would recognise. He has a Jewish-sounding name because his father was Jewish. That's it. So if he is the 'quintessence', on what remote periphery of 'Jewishness' are the people who actually practise Judaism?</p> <p>That, of course, is beside the point, as anyone familiar with the intellectual contortions of anti-semitism knows. Anyone unfamiliar with that prejudice, or who thought it was a purely historical artefact, should read Denis MacShane's Globalising Hatred: The New Anti-Semitism. MacShane, a Labour MP and former minister, doesn't deal specifically with Mandelson-baiting, but he would recognise the warped thinking behind it. Mandelson's ostensible non-Jewishness is exactly what sets him up as the perfect stereotype: the furtive puppet-master; the Svengali; the 'Prince of Darkness'; slippery, a bit too clever, dishonest.</p> <p>There is a long tradition of Westminster old boys being snide about Jewish parvenus. Tory grandees in the early Eighties issued a collective harrumph at Margaret Thatcher's promotion of Leon Brittan, Nigel Lawson and Michael Howard ('More old Estonian than old Etonian' in Harold MacMillan's famous dig). MacShane treats that sort of chatter - 'dinosaur Tory anti-semitism' - briskly. He is more concerned about a resurgence of overt and vicious treatment of Jews, including a rise in violent crimes against them. This is no speculation. MacShane presents ample evidence of increased hostility in nearly every country with a large Jewish community - and in those without one, too. In Japan, for example, there is a brisk trade in pamphlets purporting to expose a plot by Jewish financiers to control the world.</p> <p>The sinister global conspiracy is one of the oldest and most pervasive tropes of anti-semitism. In the first half of the 20th century, that generally meant presenting the Jews as responsible for Bolshevism. In the 1950s, the Foreign Office suspected that the new state of Israel was a Soviet puppet. Meanwhile, the Kremlin was conducting a purge of 'rootless cosmopolitans' - code for Jews. Israel is now generally regarded as an American proxy. Or, rather, America is judged around the world to be controlled by Jews, through the 'Israel lobby'. </p> <p>MacShane devotes some time to deconstructing that particular idiom. American Jews, he points out, are entitled to call on their government to pursue a certain policy. There are two reasons why that might look pernicious: first, if it is assumed that the government in question exercises no critical judgment of its own - that the 'lobby' is not a supplicant to power but the hidden source of it; second, if it is assumed that the policy request is unquestionably repulsive. Both assumptions in the case of the US alliance with Israel are false. Both, when applied to the influence of Jews, reek of anti-semitism. </p> <p>There are lots of features of US policy that foreigners, and plenty of Americans, think are misguided. But only with Israel do critics seem to assume that the White House loses all rationality and takes dictation from some extraneous, parasitical force. If the 'Israel lobby' was all-powerful, MacShane notes, it might have done something by now about Washington's solid alliance with Saudi Arabia, which is the chief exporter of an ideology explicitly dedicated to the destruction of Israel and of the Jews. </p> <p>MacShane looks at the set texts of radical jihadi Islam and finds them full of abuse of Jews. He observes that the idea of an aggressive Jewish conspiracy is not a marginal strand in Islamist radicalism, but the essential premise. An ideological edifice of murderous hatred towards Jews is being erected in communities around the world and yet many people think anti-semitism is something that once happened in pre-war Europe. Worse, many left-leaning, liberal intellectuals seem to think that anti-Israel rhetoric is one of the more reasonable bits of the jihadi agenda - that on Zionism, at least, the terrorists have a point. Except that, by Zionists, al-Qaeda means Jews and its reason for hating them is that they are conspiring to control the world. Any complicity with that notion was anti-semitic in the Thirties and it still is. </p> <p>Globalising Hatred is a small klaxon of a book, more concerned with raising the alarm than building a thesis. The arguments sometimes reel around giddily but are steadied on their way by solid facts. And in case you wondered, no, Denis MacShane is not Jewish. Does that make a difference to his argument? </p>",
  "<p>It was hard to argue with the verdict of the North Queenslanders in the taxi rank outside this dusty out-of-town stadium, even if they may have taken the odd drink of XXXX Gold in forming it. 'If your blokes play like that next week, they'll get belted,' one said in reference to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/englandrugbyleagueteam\">England's</a> next <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/rugbyleagueworldcup2008\">World Cup</a> assignment, against <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/australiarugbyleague\">Australia</a> in Melbourne on Sunday, after they were given the fright of their lives by a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/papuanewguinearugbyleagueteam\">Papua New Guinea</a> team inspired by the Hull KR veteran Stanley Gene. </p> <p>The Kumuls led 16-12 at half-time and were a tight forward-pass decision away from stretching further ahead early in the second half, which on all the evidence up to that point would have condemned Tony Smith's misfiring team to a humiliating opening defeat. </p> <p>Instead England were able to pull level when the young Leeds wing Lee Smith scored the second try of a debut hat-trick that at least provided one positive from a mostly worrying night and for the next 20 minutes they finally began to tackle with more conviction, control the ball and impose themselves on opponents who contained several part-timers in their ranks. </p> <p>'We found out a whole lot about ourselves tonight,' said Smith, whose take on the game - in public at least - was much more optimistic than those of the queuing locals. 'To be able to not play great and still find a way to win and turn things around when things are going against you is a great thing to have.'</p> <p>England's problems began in the 15th minute when, with a simple opening try for Ade Gardner already in the bank, they squandered a glorious chance to pull 12 points clear as James Graham was unable to take James Roby's unnecessarily ambitious pass. The Kumuls had already shown the need to treat them with more respect, as Gene directed a collection of willing young runners superbly and also displayed a delicate left-footed kicking game that has mostly been kept under wraps during his 13 years in England with Huddersfield, Bradford and Hull, but mostly Hull KR. </p> <p>The cheerful stand-off from a village in the jungle near Goroka - which now has electricity thanks to the recent investment of some of Stanley's British earnings - had reinforced to his young team-mates before the match that his performances in the 1995 World Cup had changed his life by securing his move to the promised land of east Hull, and there will surely now be Super League scouts salivating over the ability of Australian-based Kumuls such as the loose-forward Rod Griffin and the wing David Moore. </p> <p>It was Griffin who scored the try that brought the wonderfully committed underdogs level in the 20th minute, surging between two static defenders - Graham and Gareth Ellis - and over the covering full-back Paul Wellens. England seemed to have recovered from that wobble when Smith scored his first from Wellens' floated pass, especially when Kevin Sinfield added his second touchline conversion. But again any complacency was shattered, as the Kumuls responded with two tries in four minutes to take that half-time lead. </p> <p>A sloppy forward pass deep inside their own territory put England under unnecessary pressure to allow Jason Chan to score the first from Gene's long pass, and then Smith made a dreadful hash of trying to catch a high kick by the inventive scrum-half Keith Peters, allowing George Kepa to cross in the corner. </p> <p>England looked stunned as they left the field for the break, and it would have been hard to see them hitting back to win had Australian referee Shayne Hayne not denied Moore a try, ruling correctly that the final pass from the second-row Jason Nightingale had drifted forward. </p> <p>Instead, an equalising second try for Smith, after quick hands from Rob Burrow and the substitute Jon Wilkin, brought them level in the 51st minute and soon they were ahead with another replacement, Danny McGuire, feeding the ball out wide and Burrow turning it back inside for Martin Gleeson to score. </p> <p>Sinfield's third goal gave England a six-point cushion, but it was only in the 70th minute that they established the necessary breathing space, Sinfield keeping the ball alive on the sixth tackle for Gleeson and Leon Pryce to create Gardner's second try. </p> <p>Smith then completed his hat-trick from Keith Senior's break, continuing a remarkable month for the 22-year-old who was a relative unknown until he switched to full-back and was named man of the match in Leeds's Grand Final victory over St Helens. </p> <p>But even then the Kumuls kept coming, with another defensive error by Smith leaving England sufficiently stretched for Paul Aiton to touch down Peters' kick. </p> <p>This may have been anything but convincing for England, but it was the perfect contest with which to launch the tournament. </p> <p><strong>Dairy Farmers Stadium 10,780</strong></p> <p><strong>Game rating </strong><strong>||||||||||</strong><strong> Referee </strong>S Hayne (Aus)</p> <p><strong>England</strong>Wellens; Gardner, Gleeson, Senior, Smith; Pryce, Burrow; Peacock, Roby, Graham, Hock, Ellis, Sinfield <strong>Interchange</strong> McGuire, Morley, Fa'asavalu, Wilkin</p> <p><strong>Tries</strong> Gardner 2, Smith 3, Gleeson <strong>Cons</strong> Sinfield 4</p> <p><strong>Papua New Guinea </strong>Wilshere; Kepa, Parker, Maori, Moore; Griffin, Peters; Aizue, Aiton, Exton, Costigan, Nightingale, Gene <strong>Interchange</strong> Pora, Moni, Chan, Wabo</p> <p><strong>Tries</strong> Griffin, Chan, Kepa, Aiton <strong>Goals</strong> Wilshere 3</p>",
  "<p>Sign of the times: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/everton\">Everton</a> failed to sell out this game, just as they narrowly failed to fill Goodison for last month's Merseyside derby. </p> <p>Unlike in the Liverpool game, however, Everton refused to lie down and die in this one, and the 4,000 absent fans missed out on one of the treats of the season. The home side fought back magnificently in a rousing second half and had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/manchesterunited\">Manchester United</a> rocking on their heels. Indeed Everton could have won the game had Yakubu shown more composure in front of goal when Rio Ferdinand's second lapse of the game presented him with a gift-wrapped opportunity to beat Edwin van der Sar. </p> <p>Ferdinand's first lapse had seen Everton draw level in a way few could have predicted after a one-sided first half. The defender came hurtling to his right touchline to intercept an Everton clearance upfield and missed, leaving Steven Pienaar to set up an attack that culminated in the lanky Marouane Fellaini rising highest to nod in Phil Neville's cross. It is possible that Everton paid \u00a315m for the 20-year-old on account of his height. Fellaini certainly puts himself about more now than when he arrived and realises he is expected to compete under high balls, though his and Leon Osman's limitations on the floor in the first half had been ruthlessly exposed by the combination of Ryan Giggs and Darren Fletcher playing centrally with Cristiano Ronaldo and Park Ji-Sung on the flanks. </p> <p>Somewhat surprisingly, given that Everton still await their first home win of the season, David Moyes declared his side had nothing to lose against a team no one would expect them to beat. He backed up his words by playing both Louis Saha and Yakubu up front, tearing up his previous policy of packing the midfield and playing for draws, a plan that had rarely worked. </p> <p>Unfortunately, the new gung-ho Everton just looked gummy in the first 45 minutes. Saha and Yakubu will never win awards for industry and had no platform on which to build, with United so dominant in midfield. Everton's chief failing was an inability to pick up Giggs and, as the travelling fans predicted, he duly tore them apart. His role in the opening goal was masterful, biding his time on the edge of the penalty area as Everton covered all obvious options, until picking out Fletcher's run forward. Fellaini should have followed him but did not, and after taking Giggs' pass in his stride Fletcher needed a single touch to take him past Joleon Lescott and the goal was at his mercy. </p> <p>United conjured any number of similar situations before the interval and managed to waste them all, with Wayne Rooney and Dimitar Berbatov threatening much but achieving little. Both missed chances in a casual manner, as if they knew more would soon come along, and rather too often they would dummy or step over the ball in misplaced anticipation of the other taking advantage, suggesting their allegedly telepathic relationship still needs a bit of work. </p> <p>'We were a little bit fortunate to turn round just one goal down,' Moyes said candidly. 'They had chances to score more, but at half-time we were still in the match and we knew we had to get tighter. That's all we did. We got closer and got after them, and I am really pleased with the way we finished.' </p> <p>Had Everton begun the game as they ended it they might even have won. United's attempts on goal all but dried up in the second half, while mistakes began to creep in from the previously impeccable Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidic and Wes Brown. All three points would have flattered Everton, though once back on terms it always looked possible, never more so than when Ferdinand underhit a back-pass and was relieved to see Van der Sar palm Yakubu's shot on to a post. The striker should have done better.</p> <p>The final 20 minutes were as end-to-end as an FA Cup tie, with United sending on all their attacking substitutes and Everton constantly threatening on the break. There were bookings for Phil Jagielka, Phil Neville, Brown, Rooney and Fellaini as the temperature rose, though Alan Wiley kept things sensible and when a disappointingly ordinary Rooney provoked the Park End by kissing his badge after collecting his caution he was swiftly substituted for his own good. </p> <p>'I don't know why he was booked,' Sir Alex Ferguson said, 'but I had fears about the way the referee was behaving, the crowd was reacting and I thought he might be sent off. I don't think the referee protected our players enough, but give Everton credit, they changed things and you can't deny them their point.'</p> <h2>THE FANS' PLAYER RATINGS AND VERDICT</h2> <p><strong>Sean Radcliff, <a href=\"http://Everton.VitalFootball.co.uk\">Everton.VitalFootball.co.uk</a></strong></p> <p>That was absolutely brilliant in the end. The first half was tame, but we were like the Everton of last season in the second half and we dominated it \u2013 we could've won it, but to be honest so could they. Still, whatever Moyes said at half-time worked \u2013 there was no change in formation, but he clearly gave them a kick up the arse. Neville was a brilliant leader after the break, everything was going through him. And the atmosphere in the second half was like the Fiorentina game last year \u2013 the best of the season. Hopefully we can turn things around on the back of this.

To start off with we were in a different class, passing and moving and interlinking up front. Berbatov was running things. And when we got our goal after 20 minutes we expected another and that would be the end of the game. Giggs, too, was tremendous early on. But in the second half they seemed more up for it, a mistake by Rio lifted their fans and team and gave them hope \u2013 they scored. Their fans, who had been quiet (they're probably not used to getting up early) were now in good voice, and their team just fought harder, passed it better, and we went off our game.

  "<p>With the markets crashing once more and the last rites being pronounced over Western capitalism, the consensus is that autumn 2008 is when global economic power will have been seen to pass to Asia in general and China in particular. This is the new economic powerhouse. Its growth may slow a little while the West flounders, but it will emerge from this recession as the world's centre of economic and financial gravity. Goodbye, USA. Hello, the Chinese Communist party.</p> <p>It is fashionable foolishness that ignores some brute realities. The first is that Asia, except Japan, remains in essence a subcontractor to the West. Two-thirds of China's exports, for example, are made by foreign companies who essentially reprocess imports of semi-manufactured goods that are then shipped to Europe and the US. It is an economy that does not innovate - it is the great copier and counterfeiter of Western technology. This may change over the next 200 years, but not during the lifetime of most of the people reading this column.</p> <p>It is true there are Asian hot spots. South Korea is following Japan's lead, while India, whose foreign trade is smaller than Spain's, has promising companies and dynamic cities. Then there are Hong Kong, Singapore and Bangkok. But poverty, illiteracy, sexism and caste still dominate. The notion that mainland Asia is about to supplant the US, EU and Japan in the near future is risible. </p> <p>Nor is Asia set to prop up the shattered Western economy. This is the other fashionable notion peddled until recently. Asia is now so strong and independent of the West, ran the argument, that it has 'decoupled'. It would carry on spending and producing, so partly underwriting the world economy and ameliorate the worst of the coming recession.</p> <p>Asia's terrified financial markets, coming to terms with their region's vulnerability, are now testimony to this profound misunderstanding. Asia is an exporter and saver, of which the best example is China. It consumes a smaller proportion of GDP than it saves, with total consumption lower than Italy's. If its exports stagnate, as they have with the rise of the renminbi against the dollar and the slowing of American spending, then its economy slows down. The rate of growth has dropped by a quarter over the last 12 months and there is every prospect of a further sizable drop over the next 12. </p> <p>Nor can investment rise to fill the gap. China is saturated with ports, highways, steel mills, cement and petrochemical plants that operate at a fraction of capacity. As the realisation has grown that capacity has run far ahead of now falling demand, China's bubble economy has burst rather like our own. Its stock market has crashed and property prices are collapsing. The manufacturing heart in the Pearl River area near Hong Kong is being destroyed. Half the 2,200 factories in the shoe industry have shut, as have a third of the 3,600 toy factories. </p> <p>China's ever-growing demand for raw materials is easing. Although the Chinese government says its sheltered banking system is insulated from problems in the West, last week top Chinese investment firm CITIC reported a $2bn loss from taking 'unauthorised' positions in the derivatives markets. China's banking system is a house of cards, with billions of dollars of toxic loans made at the party's request to loss-making enterprises set against tiny amounts of core capital. Some unexpected losses and the results could make the West's financial crisis look tame.</p> <p>The party is acutely aware of the risk, lowering interest rates and considering a big boost in infrastructure spending. Outsiders seem perplexed at the alarm that growth may subside to 7 per cent next year; would that Britain and the West will be so lucky.</p> <p>But bear in mind two key facts. China managed to grow throughout the Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution at nearly 5 per cent per annum. The bulk of the adult population still farms tiny plots of hopelessly unproductive land in grinding poverty. All it takes is a tiny fraction of its workers moving from doing nothing in the countryside to doing something in the towns deploying modern technology to produce growth. In these conditions, only 5 per cent growth is a crisis. </p> <p>If 7 to 8 per cent growth is better, it will still not stave off a sharp increase in unemployment. Already there is an explosion of what the Chinese call 'incidents' - social unrest. As the Ministry of Labour has warned, China needs to create jobs with sky-high growth rates if it is to retain social stability. </p> <p>In which case it must change. It has to consume more and become more innovative and productive. But communism stands as a roadblock. </p> <p>The party is considering an amazing concession - allowing peasants to be able to buy and sell long leases on their land. This would be the biggest step towards granting property rights to 730 million rural peasants since the Revolution. The reason? The party needs them to use their land as collateral to save less and spend more. It is political dynamite, removing one of the key props of the party's support - its control of villages and land rights. But it must be considered. China is beginning the perilous path to becoming freer because the economy demands it.</p> <p>Then there is innovation, where its track record is abominable. China accounts for only 0.1 per cent of the world's patents that apply in Japan, the EU and the US. Economists believe the invention of general-purpose technologies, like the internal combustion engine, internet or aeroplane, that have massive general application, holds the key to growth and will accelerate in the decades ahead. Not one of this century's general-purpose technologies will be made outside the West and Japan, which have held a monopoly for 300 years. Their lead will widen rather than narrow. </p> <p>The Chinese government knows it must unblock control of universities, laboratories and business if China is to change this dismal prediction and create the subtle combination of freedom to experiment and incentives in which innovation flourishes. Meanwhile, the West's financial travails are not for ever. Once they are solved, the West will be back, exploiting its capacity to innovate.</p> <p>Authoritarian Asian capitalism is not about to triumph over the Western liberal variant. China needs to change profoundly if it is to join the first rank of nations as their equal. Meanwhile, don't look to it - or the rest of Asia - to soften recession. The West made this mess. It must clear it up itself.</p>",
  "<p>There was an irritating story in the newspaper last week about a scaffolder in Merseyside who is being fined by the council for not declaring the clingfilm in which he wraps his daily sandwich as industrial waste. And when I say irritating, I mean irritating in so many different ways - a cluster bomb of irritation going off in my brain.</p> <p>First, and most obviously, it's irritating because that does sound unreasonable: his sandwich wrapper isn't industrial waste - the guy even offered to take it home with him every day - why should he get fined? But then my irritation is intensified by the realisation that this is all grist to the mill of articles like that. Inducing impotent fury is their stock in trade and I hate giving them the satisfaction. It's the first step towards surrendering to a world view that a certain type of journalism seems bent on inducing in its readers in which a supposed majority of upstanding citizens have their good-heartedness and common sense perpetually betrayed by feckless and liberal low functionaries. 'Society is everyone else's fault but yours,' they tell anyone who'll listen, 'and that angry feeling we've just made happen in your head is proof of it.'</p> <p>But most irritating of all is that it's an example of more moaning about councils. People moan about councils in the same way they moan about the weather - as if there's nothing they can do to affect it and as if it's not their fault. But it is our fault: we don't bother to turn up for local elections very often; when we do we vote on national issues; hardly any of us could name our local councillor; and yet we give these people a vast amount of our money.</p> <p>Essentially, we get exactly the idiots, jobsworths and crooks we deserve. The wonder is not what councils get wrong but that they achieve any level of competence at all. We've collectively put a pile of cash in an unlocked garage and have the gall to moan when it doesn't get spent in the public interest. We're too bored by local politics to scrutinise it and so when councils screw things up, we should see that as the inevitable consequence of all that extra TV-watching time we've bought ourselves.</p> <p>The contrast with our attitude to national politicians could hardly be greater. While it's liberty hall for councillors to lose all our money in Iceland and give building contracts to their brothers in law, MPs just can't catch a break. We've always paid them poorly (and when I next hear someone say: 'Well, they earn a lot more than me!' I swear I will reply: 'Well, I want them to be a damned sight cleverer than you!') but now they can't even eat a few free meals or give an admin job to a relative.</p> <p>We are chipping away at their perks: expenses claims are quoted in humiliating detail, right down to the junior minister's last pair of rubber underpants; they can't take so much as an olive on a stick from an oligarch without declaring it. And only last week, they were being criticised for Parliament taking a 24-day Christmas break, as if, out of respect for the credit crunch, they should be spending the entire period passing uplifting festive laws.</p> <p>I fail to see why we expect anyone normal with any prospects to do this job. We've made it so unpalatable that only the truly power-crazed, those who will forsake comfort, privacy and the respect of their peers for the thrill of authority, would consider it. (And I suppose, to be fair, those with a genuine sense of public duty, but that's hardly to be relied upon.) Of course, many of our leading politicians hardly seem deserving of more cash and freebies but, had more cash and freebies been on offer, more capable people may have jostled them out of power.</p> <p>But why are we so resistant to the idea that senior politicians should be paid to the point where they could be considered rich when this happens to people at the top of almost every other profession? We're happy enough for local councils to piss away billions of pounds of public money unscrutinised but a few tens of millions making MP a job worth having is, for some reason, beyond the pale.</p> <p>As a result, we have the unedifying spectacle of a Tory frontbencher and a Labour cabinet minister exchanging insults about who behaved most grubbily on a Russian billionaire's yacht. In the case of poor old George Osborne, all he's even accused of doing is trying to find a legal way for Oleg Deripaska to give \u00a350,000 to the Tory party. Only \u00a350,000 - he'd probably have found that down the back of one of the yacht's sofas. It wouldn't pay for a spin doctor - it would barely pay for a spin nurse.</p> <p>We've made our politicians people who are too easily wowed by a free holiday in Corfu. I say, let's splash out nationally and give MPs enough money for their own relatively lavish holidays so they won't end up in the thrall of the likes of Nat Rothschild, a man whose prominence has little to do with merit and everything to do with money. And yet he is in a position to play our elected representatives off against each other, to call them rude, to humiliate them.</p> <p>People capable enough to become our national leaders, in any functional system, shouldn't have to take that shit from a playboy. They should be sufficiently well rewarded that their heads aren't so easily turned and, if we need to give them a yacht each to ensure that, it's money well spent in my book and a tiny percentage of what we allow councils to waste every year simply because the leaflets that come through the door are too boring to read.</p> <p>But the way things are heading, soon the Rothschilds and Deripaskas will be able to buy a cabinet minister's good opinion with a steak dinner and a go on a full-sized snooker table.</p>",

  "<p><strong>The place</strong> Cardiff's Noughties regeneration has given the compact city centre a real buzz; in <strong>the Millennium Stadium</strong> it has one of the UK's best sporting arenas. It's a perfect venue for spectacle and the high-octane racing of stage 15 will be preceded by entertainment from acrobats, dancers, stunt riders and pyrotechnics - great value considering that tickets cost from \u00a313 for an adult, and \u00a31 for a child.</p> <p><strong>The event</strong> Dramatic, dangerous and very, very dirty, Britain's first major rally was established in 1932. This year, the former Rally of Great Britain is the final round of the world championship, with 120 cars competing in 19 stages across south and mid-Wales, over four days. Cardiff hosts the ceremonial start and finish, plus a frenetic short-stage race at the Millennium Stadium on the Saturday evening. By then, S\u00e9bastien Loeb may have wrapped up a fifth world title, but Mikko Hirvonen, who won here last year, could run him close.</p> <p><strong>The locals</strong> Motor sport fans tend to be a family-friendly bunch and, although the Cardiff Massive have a reputation for being somewhat boisterous on a night out, they're also sports mad. Just join in the singing and you'll soon be on friendly terms.</p> <p><strong>Where to stay</strong> Cathedral Road, a short walk from the stadium, is lined with B&amp;Bs with very reasonable tariffs, including the Church Hotel run by Charlotte's parents - but they book up early. For a spot of luxury, check in to St David's Hotel and Spa on the swankified waterfront at Cardiff Bay.</p> <p><strong>Where to eat and drink</strong> St Mary's Street, the main strip, is where most of the city will be hanging out before and after the stage, with any number of places to find a cheap pint of Brains.

  "<p>The most important building in European football is a stylish labyrinth of steel and glass in Nyon, a town tucked away on the banks of Lake Geneva on the edges of French-speaking Switzerland. This is the headquarters of Uefa, where every big decision about football, from the size of the balls for youth teams to the rules of their international competitions, is made. Appropriately enough for an organisation often demonised by English fans as the enemy of the game, the place has something of the look and atmosphere of the lair of a James Bond baddie. Uefa foot soldiers scurry busily about the sleek and gleaming corridors; if the place ever caught fire, or came under assault from English fans, you can just imagine them making good their escape in the underground tunnels, heading for the boats and then the tranquil lake beyond.</p> <p>Not that the officials of Uefa have anything to worry about right now. This place has a supremely confident atmosphere, as befits an organisation that has been running European football since 1955 and is now home to the Champions League, and all other European competitions at every level. This confidence is also exuded by Michel Platini, Uefa's president, as we shake hands in the boardroom and sit down to discuss the future of football in Europe, including the Premier League. Platini is slightly chubbier than in his mid-1980s prime when, with Juventus and France, he was probably the best midfielder in the world, but he has lost none of his impish charm. His eyes have a roguish, humorous glint and he is quick to take off his jacket, serve coffee and joke about the grandeur of his position, which he took up in 2007.</p> <p>But he is deadly serious about his new role as the most important man in the European game. Unlike his predecessor, Lennart Johansson, Platini is unafraid of controversy. Traditionally the role is one of soft diplomacy, negotiating around the big and powerful clubs. One of the accusations made against Uefa in the past has been that they have run scared of those clubs, intimidated by their financial and political clout. But this is not how Platini sees his organisation.</p> <p>'Uefa has a big role as the guardian of European football,' he says. 'It is not about money but values. And that is why I am here.' This is not, however, the way many people in England see it. Most notably, Platini's scathing comments on the Premier League, arguing mainly that it has distorted the balance of power in European football, tipping the odds permanently in favour of the richest English clubs, have made him many enemies at the top level of the game. </p> <p>The black propaganda about Platini is that he is simply anti-English; the complaints are down at grassroots level, in blogs and on the terraces. The case against him is based on his refusal to back England's bid to host the 2018 World Cup and his comment in June that, on their current form, the England team would not be missed from Euro 2008: 'England's absence means nothing to me,' he famously remarked. This is when the blogs went ballistic, accusing Platini of every Gallic crime under the sun, from cowardice to outright Brit-bashing.</p> <p>But none of this is as simple as it seems; Platini would say he has the greatest respect for England as the home of football. This is why he wants to save us from ourselves, by which he means the over-arching power and sheer tedium of the Premier League. One of his most provocative steps was his 2007 proposal that major European countries allocate a Champions League place to the winners of their national cup. This, in England's case, would mean replacing the fourth team in the league with the FA Cup winners.</p> <p>Predictably, this was given short shrift by the G-14 - a group of the most powerful clubs in Europe, since superseded by the larger European Club Association. The Premier League clubs, with Liverpool and Manchester United leading the way, have been particularly angry that a hard-fought-for Champions League place, with its massive financial rewards, could go to, say, Stoke or Aston Villa - teams who in any given year could pull off a good cup run and might then become rich without the benefit of multimillionaire backers. </p> <p>So far Uefa and Platini have backed off in the face of the opposition, but are still seeking to introduce less cash-rich countries into the footballing elite of Spain, Italy, Germany and England. For example Platini's latest plans, announced this summer, include investigating the high levels of debt at the top clubs. He calls this 'cheating' and wants to establish 'a level playing field'. Manchester United and Chelsea in particular have taken umbrage at this, although you cannot help feeling that is because at some level they know Platini is right. He also wants to introduce a ban on international transfers on players under the age of 18, which he says will stop clubs poaching players from poorer and more vulnerable countries.</p> <p>Ordinary English fans are also suspicious of Platini's perceived attacks on the Premier League, guessing that what he really wants to do is prevent the kind of English superiority that led to Liverpool, Chelsea and Manchester United battling it out in the final four places in last season's Champions League. The more rabid fans see him as a demented French racist who hates the English and wants to undo the 'golden age' of the Premier League. So is he a hero, villain or madman?</p> <p>Platini laughs at the question. But he is also quick to make two penetrating points: first, that there is no such thing as the 'golden age' of the Premier League, merely a permanent stand-off between the richest teams, all of whom are supported by unfeasible levels of debt. 'All fans of football in England know in their hearts that this is the case,' he tells me. 'Soon in England you will have no English players, no English managers, just foreign speculators.' Most damagingly, Platini also asserts that so-called 'English superiority' is a myth when nearly all of the players in the top English teams are foreigners. 'You have to ask yourself what that means for football at a national level. England is the traditional home of football, but do you think that England will ever win the World Cup again? When you look at the statistics right now - when hardly any English players are in the final stages of the Champions League - it is a good question, and the answer is probably no. At least it will not happen under the present structures.' Although his critics could point out that there were 10 England players in the starting line-ups when Manchester United played Chelsea in May's final.</p> <p>Platini's most powerful enemy at the highest level is Richard Scudamore, the chief executive of the Premier League, who, in a response to Platini's suggestion in 2007 that the power of the Premier League had to be curtailed, described his views as not much more than you would hear in 'the corner of a pub'. Platini smiles again. 'I am a football man, not a businessman or a politician, and so I would rather be closer to the fans in the pub than, say, Richard Scudamore. You have to remember that football is a game - a beautiful game, yes, and one that makes millions, but it is a game, a spectacle made for the fans and not the money-men.' The most recent manager to face Platini's barbs is Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, who was accused by Platini in the pages of the Bordeaux newspaper Sud-Ouest of poaching youngsters of 13 for the Arsenal academy. 'Ars\u00e8ne is TMPG - Tout pour ma gueule [Everything for my own gob],' he said. Platini recanted a week later in the pages of Le Parisien. 'I was too hard on Ars\u00e8ne,' he said in a rather meagre apology. But still the point was made.</p> <p>Throughout his playing career, Michel Platini was a crowd-pleaser. The defining features of his style were an elegant mastery of long, dribbling runs, often at top speed, and an indomitable bravado that endeared him to players and fans alike. His early career was often marred by injury - he was a carefree player in the tough French league of the 1970s and early 1980s, a far more physical environment than it is now. He never walked away from even the toughest defenders, preferring to dazzle them into submission.</p> <p>He began his professional career with AS Nancy in 1972, winning the French second division in 1975 and the French Cup three years later, but hit the heights with Saint-Etienne. When Platini joined in 1979, Saint-Etienne were ambitious and hungry for a European trophy. But they were also a team in a long, slow decline and, despite success in the French league in 1981, the great nights of European glory that they had known in the 1970s - most notably losing narrowly in the final of the European Cup in 1976 - were a fading memory. </p> <p>Platini stamped his authority on European football as the midfield general of Juventus in the mid-1980s. He joined the Italians in 1982 and was the top scorer in Serie A three times running. But it was not always straightforward: he had a shaky start in Turin and at first thought of leaving Italy under pressure from its media cauldron. Forging a world-class partnership with the Pole Zbigniew Boniek, however, he led Juventus to the 1984 European Cup-Winners' Cup and the European Super Cup. </p> <p>In 1985, he scored the winning goal - a controversial penalty - against Liverpool in the European Cup final at the Heysel Stadium in Brussels. This was the terrible night when 39 fans were killed during riots that brought down a stadium wall. Platini has gone down in Scouse folklore as the man who celebrated the disputed penalty with far too much enthusiasm. I have to say that as a Liverpool fan watching that night with the same sick feeling as everyone else, I too remember the clenched fist to the Juve crowd, baying for a dark revenge on Liverpool. I feel it my duty to ask Platini how he felt that night. It is the only moment when he looks uncomfortable. 'Those are bad memories,' he says. 'They were bad times for football. But I did not know what was happening in the stadium. My parents were in the crowd and they didn't know either. But the match had to be played, and I did my duty.'</p> <p>Footage of the match bears out Platini's testimony; he does indeed wave his fist at the crowd in celebration, but then straightaway he is grim-faced, resolute, back on task. The dreadful atmosphere had evidently got to him too, whether or not he knew what was happening. </p> <p>According to Platini himself, the greatest match he played in was the classic encounter between France and West Germany in the 1982 World Cup semi-finals, in Seville. This match had everything - full-on drama, twists of fate and two opponents equally matched in skill and desire. Most significantly, it was a clash between two footballing philosophies - the hard-core machine-like efficiency of West Germany and the lightning-quick brilliance of the elegant French, who could fairly make claim to be the 'European Brazil'. There was also an obvious villain in German goalkeeper Harald Schumacher, who battered the French defender Patrick Battiston to the ground, knocking him unconscious. Schumacher briefly made himself the most hated man in football, as he preened in front of goal, taunting the French fans, and eventually saving the penalty that took the Germans through to the final. 'It should have been our World Cup,' Platini says now, without the least sense of nostalgia, 'but that's what football is about. It's tragedy and heartbreak as well as winning. It is also about values - it's about good and evil.'</p> <p>With this, Platini returns to the theme of football values and the Premier League. 'It's also clear that money does not make a team,' he says. 'The example of Manchester City will be very interesting, but whatever happens it won't be about football but about politics and economics. And it's also debt. What happens when the money moves on? This is what happens in capitalist economic systems and it will happen.' I put it to him that what he is describing is essentially a conflict between Anglo-Saxon neo-liberalism and the European model of corporatist socialism. 'I prefer to say democratic socialism,' he says. 'But, yes. That is the situation.'</p> <p>In a weak defence of the Premier League, I cite the examples of Silvio Berlusconi and Gianni Agnelli bankrolling AC Milan and Juventus, respectively. But I am quickly wrong-footed by the wily Frenchman. 'Ah, but Agnelli was from Turin and Berlusconi from Milan. They were football men. I have nothing against millionaires but they must have football values and some link with the club. American and Arabian owners can never properly be part of the fans.'</p> <p>But did this mean that the French League, for example, had some moral authority over the Premier League? 'It is a different case,' he says. 'The French League exports players, which means that it can have success at a national level. Although my own opinion is that French football has become too technical, and that is why they are not too successful at the moment. They work hard at Clairefontaine [the most famous of France's nine elite training academies] but football is not just about work. Also' - and suddenly we're back to the iniquities of the Premier League! - ' I think many young French players are too interested in money in England than football in France.' </p> <p>Platini comes to life when we discuss French football culture. Not least of his achievements was to be part of a generation of French footballers who garnered the interest of French intellectuals, both for their elegant style of play and as part of the growing importance of mass culture in stuffy old highbrow France. 'Until the 1980s, football in France was a game for beaufs [chavs],' he says. 'I was even ashamed to tell my wife I was a footballer. [President] Mitterrand was a fan of football but he kept it quiet because the intellectuals would have sneered at him.' All of this changed with the Platini generation of the France team, which with Alain Giresse and Jean Tigana in the midfield was both flamboyant and elegant. Arguably, the Zinedine Zidane generation, which won the 1998 World Cup, would never have happened without these three: certainly the French love affair with football, which was pretty much universal throughout the 1990s, was born with this team. </p> <p>Platini is still very keen to present himself as a man of the people, an ordinary bloke, the voice of footballing common sense. But beneath this carefully constructed surface, there is a fierce and cunning intelligence. This is a man unafraid to use the word 'hegemony' in public (just imagine even Alan Hansen deploying this word correctly and with ease) and his ruffled charm has even made him an icon of France's gay community.</p> <p>Most famously, and perhaps most strangely, in 1987 Platini gave a long interview in the pages of the radical newspaper Lib\u00e9ration to the writer Marguerite Duras. To find an equivalent these days, this would be like Wayne Rooney in dialogue with AC Grayling. To make matters more confused, Duras - then the feminist icon of the French literary establishment - was a disciple of Georges Bataille, the notoriously convoluted philosopher of an erotic form of existentialism. Duras asked Platini questions such as: 'To be a footballer of genius is to be a martyr. You play in a dream, beyond any law - is this angelic or demonic?'</p> <p>'Quite frankly I have no idea what she was on about,' Platini says now. 'But it was extremely good fun. And it got me known with intellectuals. And that's OK. But I am a football man.'</p> <p>And with this, we're back to the present day. Platini's big message is that he is here 'to protect football'. He has a tough job on his hands - as he acknowledges, his mission at Uefa is at least as big as any of the footballing challenges he has faced. He is adamant that his presidency is not just an honorary position and that, just because he has been rebuffed by the big guns in the early stages, it does not mean the game is over. 'I believe in football,' he says. 'I am not here for any other purpose than to make sure it survives in the form that we all came to love it - as a simple game that gives pleasure and excitement and beauty to everyone. And that includes the English fans.'</p> <p>Certainly, Platini does look like he is taking Uefa to some interesting places. He is a sly political operator, suited for the feints and counter-feints of the game's administration. Most significantly, he has a clear agenda for change, which he intends to implement across the board. He argues that change must come from the bottom up and that the youth academies, which are in fact 'football factories where young players are force-fed a diet of over-training and financial cynicism', are killing the game: 'Football has a social role,' he insists, 'which is not just about taking young lads from third-world countries and making them into superstars.' Under Platini, Uefa aim to restore the balance between local and amateur clubs and what he calls 'le grand football' of big business. All of this will need to be regulated by Uefa.</p> <p>It is no less than a battle for the soul of soccer. Platini is not anti-English. He speaks with authority and love of the English game. But like many of us in England, he is nostalgic for a time when English football was a real game rather than an exercise in financial one-upmanship.</p> <p>He is also passionate about the game. More to the point, outside the boardrooms of the richest clubs, every fan who wants to be a real supporter rather than a consumer knows he is right. If he gets his way, it may just be that the crafty Frenchman with an eye for the main chance will be the unlikely saviour of English football.</p>",
  "<p>There it was. Seventy-one inches of raw political rage, a bitter trail of scratched white paint stretching from just over the rear driver's-side window and looping down and across my trunk in an effort to mess up as many parts of my car as possible. In the centre of the scrawl, just to the left of the petrol cap, was a crudely hewn \"O\" with the universal circle-and-slash. Three feet behind it on the bumper, completely unmolested, was my bright blue Obama '08 sticker.</p> <p>\"Dude, I can't believe someone keyed your car!\" my friend said, shocked at seeing the audacious act of vandalism. \"That's the height of douchebaggery!\"</p> <p>I shrugged. \"It means they're scared. They're reacting. They're losing, and they can't handle it. They don't have any good answers, and so they're lashing out like this.\"</p> <p>\"Doesn't that just make you crazy with rage?\" he asked, confused about my apparent lack of concern. \"That's <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2008/01/06/it_may_be_nasty_but_is_it_illegal/?rss_id=Boston.com+--+Massachusetts+news\">a criminal act</a>, keying a car.\"</p> <p>\"I try to keep it in perspective,\" I answered, glancing around the carpark at the gym. An hour earlier, the hideous mark hadn't been there. \"I feel like I'm really 'in the club' now.\"</p> <p>He laughed at that. The anecdotal reports from our fellow Obamanauts have documented a string of petty <a href=\"http://www2.journalnow.com/content/2008/oct/23/shame-on-them/\">vandalism across New Carolina</a>, with cars bearing Obama stickers getting <a href=\"http://www.newsobserver.com/1565/story/1261675.html\">viciously hacked</a> like this every day. It was an erratic and not particularly successful attempt at voter intimidation. At least I didn't feel intimidated. And I tried to keep things in perspective.<br> A century ago there would have been lynchings and homes afire, doors being busted down at 4am, the kind of cruel guerrilla warfare one tends to associate with banana republics and Asian despots. Even a few decades ago there would have been angry meetings, axe-handle wielding thugs, vicious dogs and fire hoses. If the sum total of politically oriented violence in North Carolina was reduced to a few angry words, a scuffle or two and poorly worded public attacks, well, I had to count that as progress.</p> <p>It's not like it's a new car. A 1998 Chrysler Concorde, its sleek lines bathed in the ubiquitous southern dust and adorned with incidental scratches honestly earned from its 120,000-mile history. It used to be my mother-in-law's car. I borrowed it five months after she bought it to take her daughter on a no-frills honeymoon in the mountains of Virginia. This was the car that carried my oldest boy home from the hospital two years later when she picked us up (my decrepit Isuzu Trooper was deemed too much of a death-trap for a newborn).</p> <p>Five years after that the lease ran out, my mother-in-law sold it to us at a bargain, and for the last four years it has been the Daddy Bus, ferrying my kids to and from school, scouts and endless trips to the grocery store. The once-luxurious charcoal grey interior has been covered with a protective coating of fast-food bags, children's artwork, sticky fingerprints and roughly 100 empty sugar-free Red Bull cans. This was a working car, now, hardly a cherished symbol of affluence. I honestly wouldn't have noticed the scratch if my friend hadn't pointed it out to me.</p> <p>\"You don't seem very intimidated,\" he said, surprised. He was from California and he had been watching the circus that is southern politics with a mixture of amusement and anxiety. Clearly he had been expecting dogs and fire hoses and race riots by this point.<br> \"I'm not,\" I shrugged. \"Like I said: they're scared. And I'm not. I'm not even particularly angry. If my cherished ideas of political philosophy were getting flushed down the toilet every day, I'd probably be scared to. I guess it's because I'm a parent. When I see stuff like this, it reminds me of my kids drawing on the walls. You can get upset about it, but they're just kids.\"</p> <p>\"So these are 'just Republicans'?\" he countered.</p> <p>\"Maybe not for much longer,\" I mused. The Republican party was imploding, already crafting the perfect circular firing squad of blame for the anticipated losses in the election. With the defection of some of the party's more popular, moderate leaders to the Obama camp, the far-right core of the party faced a more and more dismal future every day. Without some strong, central, Reaganesque figure to hold them together and give them a philosophical direction, they were writhing around in a reactionary seizure. I seriously wondered at what the Republican party would look like this time next year.</p> <p>\"Besides, they can't intimidate me,\" I added. \"I voted before I came to the gym. One-stop early voting. There were 24 little booths for filling out ballots. I figured I'd get there Friday afternoon and avoid the crowds. I had to wait a half-hour to vote anyway. The place was busier than any polling place I've seen on election day.\" With that I peeled the \"I Voted!\" sticker they hand out at the polls off of my jacket and carefully placed it on my Obama bumper sticker.</p> <p>\"You know what the best thing about this is?\" I asked my friend. \"Now some McCain supporter just bought me a new paint job. And my mother-in-law the McCain supporter is my insurance agent. So she'll get to fill out all the paperwork on this and reflect about the politics of the moment.\" That had him laughing all the way back to his car.</p> <p>As I drove away, thinking about the experience, I realised that I didn't feel like a victim. This was a struggle, a political struggle between an uncertain but hopeful future and a comfortably corrupt past. People were bound to get scared, lash out, cross some lines. This had been standard procedure for the Republican party for years, and the <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/now/politics/dixiecrats.html\">Dixiecrats</a> before them \u2013 but I knew of some militant Obama people who gave as good as they got. In the meantime, I wore my scratches like a defiant badge of pride. The time to be afraid was long over.</p>",
  "<p>Three people, including one Briton, were killed today in a shooting in front of the offices of an international courier company in Kabul.</p> <p>The killings took place in front of the DHL headquarters in the upmarket Sher Pur area of Kabul, where many foreigners live. The Foreign Office named the British victim as David Giles. The other two killed were a South African and an Afghan.</p> <p>A spokesman for DHL said: \"At this difficult time our thoughts are with the families, friends and colleagues of those who have lost their lives under such tragic circumstances. DHL is fully co-operating with authorities investigating the incident. In order not to hinder the investigation no further information can be released at this time.\"</p> <p>Zemeri Bashary, an Afghan interior ministry spokesman, said the employees were the director and deputy director for DHL in Afghanistan. </p> <p>The men were shot in their car as they were apparently pulling into the DHL office. Police at the scene covered the silver sports utility vehicle with plastic sheeting. There was blood on the ground and two bullet holes in the window of the DHL office.</p> <p>The latest attack, the killing of a British aid worker, Gayle Williams, on Monday, and a number of high profile kidnappings in the Afghan capital come after the country's president, Hamid Karzai, appointed a new interior minister responsible for policing.</p> <p>In the latest kidnapping, two Turkish engineers were seized in south-eastern Afghanistan, Afghan and Turkish officials said. </p> <p>Today's incidents underline the deteriorating security situation in Kabul and beyond in recent months as the Taliban has grown in strength in the surrounding provinces.</p> <p>In related developments, Pakistan said it had captured a militant stronghold near the Afghan border, a breakthrough in an offensive against the Taliban and al-Qaida that has sent nearly 200,000 civilians fleeing for safety.</p> <p>Major General Tariq Khan said government forces captured Loi Sam, a strategic town in the Bajur tribal region, earlier this week \"and killed the militants who were hiding there\".</p> <p>Bajur is part of Pakistan's tribal belt, which has become a haven for the Taliban and al-Qaida fighters on both sides of the frontier.</p> <p>Pakistan's army launched an offensive in Bajur in early August, saying the region had become a \"mega-sanctuary\" for militants who had set up a virtual mini-state.</p> <p>Commanders had reported stiff resistance near Loi Sam, which sits on a strategic road, from local Taliban militants reinforced by foreign fighters including some from Afghanistan.</p> <p>Khan said a total of 1,500 suspected militants and 73 troops have died in the operation so far. The army has acknowledged that residential areas have been badly damaged from fighting and its use of artillery and air strikes, but it has provided no figure for civilian casualties.</p>",
  "<p>\"Keep the change mate, I'm Icelandic, I owe you a lot more than that,\" I say jokingly in the local shops. Making bad jokes is my way of dealing with the embarrassment of being Icelandic in these turbulent times. </p> <p>Eirikur Bergmann's articles for Cif last week (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/13/iceland-banking\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/14/iceland-creditcrunch\">here</a>) didn't help. Like Eirikur, I too am angry. But unlike his misguided anger, mine is firmly focused on the Icelandic ruling elite and its millionaire cronies.<br></p> <p>I am angry that Icelandic banks were sold for a pittance to ill-suited individuals whose primary qualification was to belong to the correct political brotherhood. I am also angry that, despite a multitude of warnings from as early as 2005, no action was taken to protect the Icelandic taxpayer from becoming a victim of the present economic catastrophe.</p> <p>The fundamental issue was the size of the banking sector. The Icelandic government and its financial services authority allowed the banking sector to reach a size, proportional to GDP, that was irresponsible if not completely reckless. This worried a lot of people, both in Iceland and abroad. It became the focus of many reports and news items. </p> <p>The Icelandic government seems not to have realised that if market fortunes changed, a banking sector 10 times GDP, heavily geared, and without a credible lender of last resort might struggle to refinance itself. It gambled on sentiment. Not used to foreign investigative journalism or independent institutions, the Icelandic government was caught out, leaving its banking sector open to criticism. Foreign banks are under no obligation to lend to Icelandic banks and when they decided that the latter were not worth the risk, funding dried up. The Icelandic government, showing remarkable naivety, seems to think that foreigners are to blame for the banking failure by \"unfairly\" reporting its shortcomings.</p> <p>After two of the three major Icelandic banks went under David Oddsson, a former prime minister and now governor of the Icelandic central bank, announced that the government was not bankrupt \u2013 it was simply not going to pay the foreign debts incurred by the banks. The following morning, the Icelandic chancellor (a qualified vet) spoke to Alistair Darling, apparently explaining that, possibly there was no money to pay Iceland's legal commitments regarding <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7657630.stm\">Icesave</a>. This prompted Darling and Brown to invoke the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 to protect UK taxpayers. Whether it was appropriate to use this legislation is perhaps debatable, but that, surely, is the least of Iceland's worries. </p> <p>In an unbelievable twist that is stranger than fiction, the Icelandic government then explained to its citizens that Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling were to blame for the fall of Kaupthing (the third of the three big banks). Not their own mishandling of the whole situation, nor their careless statements to the media, nor the fact that Kaupthing followed the same risky business model as the two banks that had already gone under.</p> <p>The government's distraction tactics have been hugely successful. The Icelandic public have now rallied behind their leaders, signing a <a href=\"http://www.indefence.is/\">petition</a> to protest against being called terrorists. More than 42,000 people (last time I looked) are offended that one of the institutions that have practically bankrupted their nation appeared on a UK list of criminal/terrorist organisations and its assets have been frozen. Perhaps Iceland should create its own dangerous organisations list and put all three banks on it. To date I have found no reference to the Icelandic public being called terrorists.</p> <p>The Icelandic financial services authority \"stress tested\" all three of the Icelandic banks only a few months ago and passed them with flying colours, and, until just days before their collapse, acted more like their agents than regulators. In addition, Geir Haarde and his ministers have travelled the world trying to persuade people of the strength of the Icelandic economy and are now so profoundly embroiled in this mess it is hard to see how anyone can take Iceland seriously at any level \u2013 until this whole line-up of ministers, and their leader, have been shown the door.</p> <p>Amazingly, at the time this is written not a single head has rolled. The lack of accountability in Icelandic politics is staggering.</p>",

  "<p>I have a cure for the financial hangover we're about to suffer. My cure will make us better, it will cost us nothing and it is based on solid, historical precedent.</p> <p>In 1742, Britain was involved in the Austrian war of succession, our principle enemy being France. Our navy was very powerful but if we failed to participate in the land war on the continent, our allies threatened to make peace without us. We urgently needed money to finance a force of Hanoverian troops, to be based in Flanders. Lord Carteret, secretary of state under George II, proposed a \"sinking\" fund of \u00a31.8m to pay for the troops and for various other expenses, to be borrowed at 3% per year \u2013 and he also had a suggestion as to how to pay for it.</p> <p>In the 1740s, gin consumption in Britain had reached the proportions of a plague. Originally encouraged as a replacement for French brandy, it resulted in large sections of the poorest in the land becoming addicted. There were an estimated 10,000 gin sellers in London alone. Destitution, crime and premature death walked in that addiction's wake. Various attempts had been made to crack down. In 1736, exorbitant licensing charges had amounted to prohibition. The result was riots, and an increase in consumption to an estimated 8m gallons a year by 1743. Too many people had become dependent, either as drinkers or sellers, or both. Gin went underground. </p> <p>Now Carteret proposed a revolutionary reform. He suggested a cut in retail licensing charges from \u00a350 a year to \u00a31, a level affordable for small-time dealers. This, together with moderate duties from distillers and allowing for costs and for a small measure of supervision, would result in sufficient revenue to pay for the Hanoverian troops, and it might also bring about a reduction in the evils associated with the gin trade. The naysayers were horrified. In the parliamentary debate that followed, they insisted that gin was evil and must be outlawed permanently. It was abhorrent to make money from it. The debate was long and heated.</p> <p>Carteret won the day, and the naysayers were comprehensively proved wrong. His 1743 Gin Act was a triumphant success. It raised \u00a390,000 within a year \u2013 more than enough to pay the interest on his \"sinking\" fund. Indeed, gin substantially financed British efforts in the Austrian war of succession. But equally important, gin consumption was brought within the control of the law and mortality rates began to fall, as did alcoholism and crime. Further licensing during the following years tightened the screw (but not too much), and gin gradually ceased to be a matter of public concern.</p> <p>Today, as we are learning to our cost, the government is once more obliged to raise vast sums of money, this time to counter weaknesses in the banking system. And the sums are much more vast than they were in 1743. Gordon Brown's \"sinking\" fund to part-nationalise the banks amounts to many billions of pounds. </p> <p>It is perhaps tasteless to say so, but we are fortunate that we face a social plague very similar to that of gin \u2013 the illegal drug trade. And as in the mid-18th century, we see the failure of abolitionist policies to control the menace. The total value of this trade amounts to between \u00a32bn and \u00a36.5bn a year \u2013 all untaxed.</p> <p>Our financial hangover will be caused by the payment of interest on Brown's bank rescue package. He should take a leaf from Lord Carteret's book. He should license and tax the sale of all currently illegal recreational drugs at a level that would allow a substantial number of those involved in the trade to come in from the cold, thus incidentally reducing crime \u2013 combining this, of course, with oversight and control. </p> <p>He should ignore the naysayers, just as Lord Carteret did, and for the many medical and social arguments in favour of abolition he might care to look at the website of the <a href=\"http://www.idmu.co.uk/taxukdm.htm\">Independent Drug Monitoring Unit</a>. The total benefit of such legalisation to the Exchequer is likely to be between \u00a33.5bn and \u00a36.3bn a year, including excise duty, VAT and income tax from the dealers and allowing for additional costs. This is more than enough to pay the interest on the bank rescue package at the sort of rates a government can command. You're a world leader, Gordon, and it's a world problem. With luck, others will follow you \u2013 again.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>2:30pm:</strong> It's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/organgrinder+thexfactor\">X Factor </a>live finals Week 3, and it's Big Band Week! Unfortunately this does not mean songs by bands with lots of members, such as Earth Wind &amp; Fire or Blazin' Squad, although that would clearly be brilliant. Instead we're in for a bit of swing, a couple of big jazzy showtunes, and something that lends itself to a bit of Spanish interpretation, I'll wager. Maybe Shirley Bassey's Goldfinger - Dedo Dorado definitely has a ring to it.</p> <p>I'll be here from 7.45pm to liveblog every second of the live show, then back at 10.10 for the sing-off and results. Feel free to join in and add your comments below, and click refresh every now and then for updates and new comments.</p> <p>So I spent most of this morning with a hangover parked on the M4 Westbound near Slough (which I do not recommend), trying to remember what last year's contestants sang on Big Band Week. Or indeed who last year's contestants were - I could only remember Leon, Niki and Same Difference (who I still think were robbed). </p> <p>But I am now back in the West Country, and by the power of t'internet I can remind you as follows:</p> <p>Andy - This Guy's in Love <br>Alisha \u2013 Valerie <br>Beverly - Feeling Good <br>Futureproof - Can't Take my Eyes off You <br>Hope - Hanky Panky <br>Leon - Fly me to the Moon <br>Niki - All that Jazz <br>Rhydian - Get the Party Started <br>Same Difference \u2013 Reach </p> <p>From which, as my memory serves me, there were two performances I loved (Niki and SD), two that were total car crashes (Hope and Rhydian) and the rest were deeply unmemorable. And who the hell were Andy and Alisha? Anyone?</p> <p>So for tonight I'm predicting as follows: Scott and Austin will do nifty little rat pack numbers, Laura will mumble/scat her way through Amy Winehouse or Duffy, someone else will do a big showtune, there'll be a couple of highly dodgy big band interpretations of mainstream pop that will make our ears bleed, and we'll all get a bit drunk in the process. Hurrah.</p> <p>Oh, I've just found the list of tonight's songs on the X Factor website - do you want to know? If so, click <a href=\"http://xfactor.itv.com/stories/story-detail/item_100295.htm\">here.</a> </p> <p>In the meantime I'm off to take the 9-year-old daughter to see High School Musical 3, as soon as I've found my cheerleader's outfit and pompoms. Back at 7.45!!!</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>7:45pm:</strong> It's started! I'm high on Disney cheese, and can't wait for the excitement to begin. Wa-hoo!</p> <p>We are reminded that poor old Louis has only got one act, JLS, remaining in the competition. Surely the public wouldn't be that cruel, would they?</p> <p>Ooh, it's Dermot. I love him. Even when he's camping it up about how big the big band is. </p> <p>On come the judges. This week it's Cheryl's turn to wear one of Barbie's frocks. It's truly horrible, but my Other Half's jaw has just dropped open so I'm guessing I'm not the target audience. Top beehive though.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>7:51pm:</strong> Scott is up first, and is missing his mum and dad. He is a bit nervous about this week, bless him. He is singing Frank Sinatra's That's Life, and has a nice voice. Cracking job, from where I'm sitting.</p> <p>Louis thought it was a big safe, Danni's put her make up on with a trowel, Cheryl liked it and Simon is sniping at Louis about who picked Westlife's hits. I'm going to apologise in advance if I don't give you a blow-by-blow account of everything the judges say, because most of the time it's a giant ego-fest and not worth reporting.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>7:58pm:</strong> Next up is Daniel, who is living his dream. He cries a bit, and says he doesn't want his mum to see him crying on telly. Probably best to do it with the camera off then, no?</p> <p>Simon and Louis say he can't win, and they don't know what he's still doing in the competition. He's singing Lady Is A Tramp, and I don't know either, because it's decidedly average and his vocal is a bit weak. But he looks like he's having the time of his life, so let's leave him to it.</p> <p>The judges agree. Nice guy, bit cabaret. Danni loved it, of course. She stands up, and I am transfixed by her boobs.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>8:10pm:</strong> It's time for Laura, who is singing the Billie Holiday classic God Bless The Child. It has a big note at the end, and she is worried about it. She should be amazing.</p> <p>She is lying on a rug, and has been trussed up in a tight frock that she looks very uncomfortable in. But she plays an absolute blinder on the big note, although she can't enunciate for shit. Oh, what do I know. Top job Laura, the judges all loved it.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>8:16pm:</strong> It's child-teen Eoghan, who I find deeply bothersome. Can't really say why, I just do. He creeps me out, what can I say. Tonight he has to dance, and he's not a dancer. </p> <p>On he trots, singing L.O.V.E. It starts well, and then he moves into the duff note zone. Key change! Alas, wrong key. The judges are all on their feet. Either they loved it and my ears need syringing, or they're leaving. Nope, they loved it. The world has gone mad, because it was dreadful.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>8:27pm:</strong> Next up, it's El Ruth. She is singing Summertime. We can but hope that it is the Gershwin/Ella Fitzgerald version, rather than DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince. Or Mungo Jerry.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>8:30pm:</strong> Phew, it's Ella. And my goodness, hasn't Ruth scrubbed up to look like a total fox? She is wearing a fabulous red dress, and Simon looks vaguely aroused.</p> <p>My goodness this woman has some lungs. Her backing singers are men in berets who look like gay marines. Top performance from Ruth, and if she's not back in this competition my name's not H Factor. The judges also thought she kicked Euro ass.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>8:34pm:</strong> Alexandra is next, and this is the one I've been looking forward to most. She's going to sing Candyman by Christina Aguilera, which is a top tune and should do a good job of livening this show up a bit. Let's hope she can do it justice.</p> <p>Ooh, more gay marines.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>8:37pm:</strong> Has she forgotten the words? This is a bit of a mess. Sigh. Look, is it just me, or is Danni on something? She is making squeaky noises and being deeply annoying. The judges all thought Alexandra was amazing, but I was a tad underwhelmed. Perhaps I expected too much. Meh.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>8:47pm:</strong> Next up is Austin, who is doing Mack The Knife. Well, someone has to. It's Cowell's First Law of Big Band Week. Let us hope he keeps it true to Bobby Darin and/or Robbie Williams, rather than giving it the interpretive Billie Jean treatment, because that was well dodgy.</p> <p>He was never good at school, his parents tell us, looking very proud.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>8:49pm:</strong> Is he wearing a leather suit, or is it just very shiny? I can't tell. He looks very cute, and is doing a pretty decent job of a deeply overperformed song. Key change! Key change! Key change!</p> <p>Phew. I rather enjoyed that. Splendid job, Austin. The judges agree with me, so they have clearly recovered from their brief mental over Eoghan.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>8:54pm:</strong> JLS are up next, aka Louis's Last Hope. Can R&amp;B boys do swing? Well of course they can. And nothing is going to be a bigger kick in the head for Louis than them getting voted off. Cue....song!</p> <p>They have scrubbed up splendidly, and I am a tiny bit in love.</p> <p>Simon thought their vocals were weak, Cheryl didn't like the bit with the cloaks but is now in their fan club. Generally good comments, but now Dermot is asking them why they are wearing certain colours, in possibly the most pointless conversation of all time. I think someone in the gallery has told him to fill some time, and he doesn't have Brucie's tap dancing ability. But hey, let's not forget the awfulness of Kate Thornton.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>9:06pm:</strong> It's Diana Vickers, and she's singing Smile. What, Lily Allen? Can you sing a big band version of a song about struggling with bags from Tesco? Oh, could be Nat King Cole.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>9:08pm:</strong> She is sitting on a swing, with some shredded wheat on her head.</p> <p>I'm sorry, and I know this will be deeply unpopular, but I hate Diana's voice. I find it really affected, and she reminds me of Katie Melua. Shudder.</p> <p>The judges all think she is brilliant. Well, each to their own.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>9:13pm:</strong> Finally, it's Rachel. Who is singing Feeling Good, which Beverley sang last year. We hear that Rachel and Danni have found it hard to 'find a middle ground', which translates as 'we hate each other's guts'. We are reminded that she is trying to make a better life for her kids. Hmm.</p> <p>She looks AMAZING. And oh my god she's doing a fantastic job of this song. Performance of the night. Go Rachel.</p> <p>I am ignoring the final note, because she still kicked ass. The judges agree.</p> <p>So that's it for now, so get voting! Stand out performances of the night for me were Ruth, Austin, JLS and Rachel. I'd quite like to see Eoghan and Danny in the bottom two. Surely Danny has to go home now? Please?</p> <p>I'll be back at 10.10 for the results show, when we will be hearing all 12 acts in a 'very special charity performance'. Oh, that doesn't bode well, does it?</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>10:12pm:</strong> Ooh, we're back. Who will go? It's a tough call this week. Scott, Eoghan, Danny, JLS, Ruth - any of them could be in the bottom two. The only ones who I think are safe are Cheryl's girls.</p> <p>And we get to see all 12 act singing 'Hero', which is for charidee. Ghastly song, about to be murdered.</p> <p>It's all gone a bit American Idol, hasn't it? Cringe.</p> <p>And they're miming, which is a bit rubbish. Where are Daniel and Ruth? Weren't they allowed to sing? Did they fail the miming masterclass?</p> <p>Cheryl is crying. Danni would be too, but her tear ducts are now an integral part of her forehead.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>10:30pm:</strong> It's time for the results. The final showdown is between Daniel and Scott, which is no great surprise. </p> <p>Daniel is going to sing a song for his dead wife. Who is DEAD, in case the judges didn't know that, and they might want to think on that VERY carefully while he is singing this beautiful song that meant so much to his (dead) wife. </p> <p>Before they vote him off.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>10:40pm:</strong> Scott is singing 'I Can't Make You Love Me' - officially the dullest song in George Michael's back catalogue, and unlikely to make the judges love him. But I hold firm that he has a nice voice, despite his lack of deceased relatives, and should stay.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>10:45pm:</strong> Daniel is singing some dreadful ballad, and my stone cold heart is unmoved.</p> <p>Simon saves Scott (obv), Cheryl saves Daniel (what? WHAT?), Danni also saves Daniel as expected, and then SO DOES LOUIS. He starts crying. I am also crying, but only because we are now going to have to hear Daniel doing disco week, and I LIKED Scott.</p> <p>Bollocks.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>10:53pm:</strong> Scott looks gutted, in a slightly sinister way. He cannot hold his head up, I fear he is seeing the red mist. We see his best bit (not a typo), and his transition from spotty Pontins boy to half decent looking lad. Well, I liked you, anyway. </p> <p>And that's it for Big Band Week, people. Thanks for all your fab comments, I've had a splendid time. Next week Carrie will be at the liveblog helm for Disco Week, and having seen Carrie shake her thang on a dancefloor, we're in for a VERY special treat.</p> <p>Have a fab weekend, and goodnight!</p>",
  "<p>A legal battle being fought in Spain's national court is a sign of just how deep crusading magistrate <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltasar_Garz%C3%B3n\">Baltasar Garz\u00f3n</a> has struck into the national psyche by accusing the Franco dictatorship of crimes against humanity.</p> <p>State prosecutors at the court are determined to stop Garz\u00f3n. He is a modern-day <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom%C3%A1s_de_Torquemada\">Torquemada</a>, they claim, intent on creating a fresh Spanish inquisition. </p> <p>Why is there such an unprecedented fuss? It is, after all, hardly novel that Garz\u00f3n should investigate human rights abuses. Previously he has even chased abusers from other countries. That is why Chile's General Augusto Pinochet was arrested in London a decade ago. That is why Adolfo Scilingo, an Argentine Navy captain who tossed political opponents out of airplanes, was sent to a Spanish jail. Garz\u00f3n likes to push the law to new limits. He wins some \u2013 like Scilingo \u2013 and loses others \u2013 like Pinochet. </p> <p>Many observers, however, have looked on in wonder at his willingness to tackle abusers from Latin America and elsewhere while ignoring Spain itself. In the last couple of years Spanish police have helped in the global search for Aribert Heim, a Nazi concentration camp doctor sought by Austria. That only made the general unwillingness to study Spain's own track record from the same period seem stranger. </p> <p>Now the human rights chickens are coming home to roost. In a complex \u2013 critics would say fantastical \u2013 document, Judge Garz\u00f3n has argued that Franco and his people are responsible for the systematic killing or disappearance of 114,000 people. While their opponents in the Spanish civil war were guilty of similar crimes (and let us not forget the 6,832 priests, nuns and monks they murdered), justice for their attrocities had already been meted by General Franco himself during a 36-year dictatorship. Franco's own crimes, however, have never been investigated.</p> <p>\"Those who lost the war never sent a single bill to the dictator,\" argues I\u00f1aki Gabilondo, one of Spain's best-known left-leaning journalists. \"National reconcilation (after his death) was, above all, a gigantic act of pardon by the losers (of the civil war).\"</p> <p>An amnesty law approved after Franco's 1975 death, Garz\u00f3n says, does not count. If Hitler's Nazi henchmen could be tried using international law at Nuremberg, he adds, then the same rules can be applied to events of a few years earlier (the Spanish civil war ran from 1936 to 1939, the year that the second world war broke out).</p> <p>Already he has appointed a team of investigators who \u2013 unlike historians who complain archives are difficult to get to \u2013 can now simply flash a police warrant every time they want to get to the paperwork.</p> <p>Garz\u00f3n has named 35 suspected human rights criminals, including Franco. They are all former generals or ministers. All, conveniently, are dead. That means he can launch his enquiry without putting anyone on trial. That, perhaps, could have been too traumatic for Spaniards. Had he started this just five years ago he might have arrested Franco's brother-in-law and former right-hand man, Ram\u00f3n Serrano Su\u00f1er, who was still alive. </p> <p>Garzon's move tackles several sacred cows. First of all, it shatters a post-Franco political consensus that can best be summed up as: \"Don't mention the war.\" Secondly, it challenges those on the right who still claim that Francoism was not that bad. It is not uncommon, in certain circles in Madrid, to hear it argued that his was not a \"dictadura\" but a \"dictablanda\" \u2013 a \"soft\", or benign, sort of dictatorship.</p> <p>Finally, the judge's investigation obliges Spaniards to ask uncomfortable questions about who Franco's helpers and supporters really were. Were they just the ministers and generals? Were they also the judges, prosecutors and policemen who enforced his laws? Were they the civil servants, soldiers and others who worked directly for the regime? What about the teachers, university professors, writers or journalists who made their own compromises with the regime, even if they did not like it? Who were the people who used to pack into the Plaza de Oriente in Madrid to listen to Franco's speeches? Who, in fact, remained completely untarred by the Francoist brush? What, some might ask, did their own parents or grandparents do \u2013 and why? History, people may discover, is never created in just black and white.</p> <p>It is difficult to predict where it will all go from here. Garz\u00f3n may still be stopped in his tracks. Should he be? Or is it time the dirty laundry of Francoism was finally hung out to dry, so no-one can argue that both he, and those who ran his regime, were not that bad really?</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Good afternoon middle of the table fans</strong> and welcome to Ewood Park, Blackburn, for the twee little Saturday tea-time fixture. Rovers host Middlesbrough in a match that has \"Sky quota*\" written all over it, but these kind of games have sometimes provided some excitement. Sometimes.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p>Blackburn were pushed down into 10th place this afternoon thanks to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/oct/25/sunderland-newcastle-united-premier-league\">Sunderland's victory over Newcastle United</a>, while Boro are 13th. But a victory for the hosts will put them into seventh, and the visitors could go ninth, positions fans of either club would probably take come the end of the season.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p>The Blackburn manager <strong>Paul Ince is entertaining another of his former clubs</strong>, having lost to Manchester United when they visited a few weeks back. And it's been a mixed bag other than that this season, having beaten Everton, Fulham and Newcastle, but capitulating to West Ham and Arsenal.</p> <p>Capitulation was the name of the game when Middlesbrough took on Chelsea last week: they were utterly drubbed by the league leaders at the Riverside. And the road has hardly been much kinder to Gareth Southgate's travelling band: they have lost to Portsmouth, Sunderland and West Brom, although pinched a win at Wigan.</p> <p>Both managers have made large-scale changes to their inconsistent line-ups, full details of which are comin atcha.</p> <p>*or even Setanta.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>Teams:</strong></p> <p><strong>Blackburn:</strong> Robinson, Simpson, Ooijer, Nelsen, Olsson, Emerton, Grella, Warnock, Villanueva, Roque Santa Cruz, Derbyshire. Subs: Brown, Kerimoglu, McCarthy, Khizanishvili, Andrews, Treacy,<br>Roberts.</p> <p>Middlesbrough: Turnbull, Wheater, Riggott, Pogatetz, Taylor, Aliadiere, O'Neil, Digard, Downing, Alves, Sanli. Subs: Jones, Emnes, Shawky, Adam Johnson, John Johnson, Grounds.</p> <p>Referee: Mike Dean (Wirral)</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p>From the good people at PA Sport: </p> <p>Blackburn welcomed back striker Roque Santa Cruz from a hamstring injury to lead the line against Middlesbrough in their Barclays Premier League clash at Ewood Park.</p> <p>The Paraguay international missed last week's goalless draw at Bolton having sustained the problem before the international break.</p> <p>Three other changes saw forward Matt Derbyshire restored to the starting line-up along with Vince Grella and Martin Olsson with Christopher Samba, Robbie Fowler, Tugay and Jason Roberts making way.</p> <p>Middlesbrough boss Gareth Southgate also made four changes from the side hammered 5-0 at home to Chelsea.</p> <p>Captain Emanuel Pogatetz returned after suspension along with Didier Digard, Afonso Alves and Tuncay Sanli.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>Excuses in early dept: </strong> We have reached a new low with regard to technology. I can barely see the screen. I can make out even fewer people on it. This might not be the best MBM you've ever read.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>1 mins:</strong> Early promise from Middlesbrough, for whom a blurry figure identified as Aliadiere goes down the right and is bundled over by another blurry figure for a free kick. A blur in red puts a cross into a box full of blurs and the ball goes behind.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>2 mins:</strong> Roque Santa Cruz, who has returned from injury, marks his comeback with a speculative shy from 30 yards that rises high into the stand. This looks and sounds like watching an England international from eastern Europe in the mid 1980s.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>5 mins:</strong> I'm reliably informed that it's chucking it down at Ewood Park, although the picture is <em>that</em> grainy that it might be blazing sunshine for all I know. Very sorry about this, but we're moving desks this weekend and they took our telly. Boo.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>7 mins:</strong> Aliadiere clatters into Ryan Nelsen and gives Blackburn a chance to hurl it forward. It's easily cut out. The game is yet to settle, with little to report. Which is fortunate.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>9 mins:</strong> Aliadiere has a marvellous chance to put Boro 1-0 up when a long ball comes over the top and he has absolutely acres of space. Someone - maybe Alves - is about a mile off side, which is why everyone except Aliadiere stops and stares. But the offside player doesn't go to the ball and instead leaves it for the former Arsenal man, but his casual volley hits the bar. Bonkers.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>11 mins:</strong> And now a decent chance for Blackburn at the other end. Another long ball this time has Brett Emerton scampering after it. His low, first time shot is blocked at Ross Turnbull's near post.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>12 mins:</strong> Another cross/shot from Andre Oijer gives Turnbull a nervy moment. It bends and drops just beneath the bar at the last minute and the Boro keeper just manages to keep it out.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>14 mins:</strong> Blackburn have had the better of the past five minutes, with Santa Cruz bursting clear from a static defence and laying off to Matt Derbyshire, only for him to slash it over.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>15 mins: </strong>Roque Santa Cruz hits the post. Boro have continued this afternoon as they did last week against Chelsea, that is leaving far too much room between full-back and centre-back in the channels. Santa Cruz scampers into the space inside the left back, cuts in, but fires onto the far post across Turnbull's goal.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>19 mins:</strong> Gary Naylor has some kind of sympathy. I think. \"MBMers lament GU Towers' technology as regularly as Tottenham ship goals, so why don't you guys do this from home? It shouldn't be too difficult with this all-new information superhighway that everyone is talking about.\" I'm seriously thinking about just jacking this in and going home whether or not to continue this shower. Boro have a corner that is headed by someone into the hands of Paul Robinson.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>22 mins:</strong> What's happened here is that we're all moving desks this weekend, with us temporarily occupying the media desk's desks. They have their tellies in the air, bracketed to the ceiling, beneath which they do a lot of talking about monkeys and the goings on at rival publications. That meant that John Ashdown, who did the earlier MBM, has gone home with a cricked neck, but I'm totally shafted since none of the tellies have Setanta. The only one is about a mile away and isn't getting the best reception either. Anyway, rant over: a terrific Tuncay overhead kick just nestled in the net past Paul Robinson. But he was (incorrectly) given offside.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>25 mins:</strong> OK, back to the match. That was a shocking decision moments ago to deny Tuncay his Crouch moment: he was clearly onside when the ball was headed over the back-line, from which he swivelled back to goal to score. Other than that, though, Blackburn are looking better going forward in what is, however, a fairly scrappy encounter.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>28 mins:</strong> Pogatetz concedes a corner when he beats Santa Cruz to a long ball. But Santa Cruz rises highest when it's fizzed into the middle and Turnbull makes a solid save. Boro clear.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>30 mins:</strong> Olsson and Alves, I think, challenge for a high ball with the young Blackburn player clattering his rival to the turf. Mike Dean is itching around his top pocket but keeps his meddling card fingers out of it for the time being.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>32 mins:</strong> Nothing much happening here, except for Santa Cruz still showing his strength up front although he still can't find a way through. No one's emailing which hopefully means no one is reading, which is very much for the best.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>35 mins:</strong> Warnock now has a pot-shot from 30 yards. And the result is precisely what you might expect from Warnock having a pot-shot from 30 yards.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>37 mins:</strong> Decent cross from the left from Blackburn and Taylor beats Derbyshire in the air. No dice. Villanueva is pulling the strings in the middle for Rovers here, but to no tangible effect as yet.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>39 mins:</strong> No doubt that Blackburn have bossed this half, yet Boro could be two up. Tuncay had the ball in the net and was ruled offside when he wasn't; Aliadiere hit the bar when he thought he was offside and also wasn't. Ooijer and Aliadiere tangle in midfield, with the Boro man coming off worse giving a few minutes for us all to catch breath.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>41 mins:</strong> Aliadiere hobbles off for more treatment, as replays show that Taylor's clearance from Derbyshire (see 37 mins) was actually assisted by his hand. Should have been a penalty. Shoulda woulda coulda. Wasn't. Anyway, Aliadiere is back.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>44 mins:</strong> Tuncay juggles the ball on the edge of the Blackburn box, but uses a hand to control it, which the referee actually sees. Boro continue to press, though, until Grella gets a foot in and Blackburn can shepherd it back to Robinson.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>45 mins+1:</strong> A couple of minutes injury time, largely the result of the Aliadiere knock. He's back on but treading a little gingerly. Ryan Nelsen feeds Villanueva who in turn sends an excellent ball through the horribly square back four, but Santa Cruz <em>just</em> can't beat Turnbull.</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>Half time.</strong> Much needed.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>Half-time:</strong> Things seem unlikely to improve vis-a-vis getting a picture on the TV that doesn't seem to be viewed through gauze. But these are desperate times and we'll muddle through. An improvement on the pitch wouldn't go amiss: a lot of bluster without much genuine excitement in rain-soaked Lancashire. Much like a night out in Blackpool.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>46 mins:</strong> No changes at half-time and away we go again. Villanueva, who was perhaps the best player of the first half, starts the second with a wending run, cutting in from the right, and getting a shot away. Wide.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>47 mins:</strong> Downing has a free kick in a dangerous-ish place, although the \"England man\" attempts to put in a regular cross from deep and instead pings it so far over the bar that it's not even funny.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>49 mins:</strong> Villanueva is bundled over wide on the left and sends a much better cross into the mixer that has everyone leaping but none connecting. Santa Cruz clatters into his own player and seems to crick his neck on the way down. It looks potentially bleak for a moment as he's flat out, but then he sits up and grins like a kid playing dead and tricking his parents.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>52 mins:</strong> Santa Cruz survived the incident earlier, jogging off but soon returning. Boro can't seem to get the ball out of their own half, with their only attempt - a long ball from defence - skidding away from the chasing Aliadiere and onto the boot of Robinson.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>54 mins:</strong> Blackburn press again with Simpson laying off to Villanueva in midfield, where the Chilean is fouled. Emerton's free-kick grazes off the head of Wheater and <em>that</em> far behind the onrushing Ryan Nelsen.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>56 mins: </strong>It's still all Blackburn, as they attack down the left, only let down by Olsson's poor control. At the other end, Blackburn almost get themselves in knots when Robinson comes to the edge of his box to collect a long ball over the top and Nelsen, perhaps the owner of a video featuring Robinson's Tottenham and England career highlights, doesn't trust him and opts to thwack clear himself. There's no Boro man anywhere near and they survive.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>59 mins:</strong> I can't lie, this is not much to look at, even if it was on the latest HD offering rather than viewed through a rain-lashed frame of frosted glass, which is how my screen currently appears.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>61 mins:</strong> Very, very close from Afonso Alves, who shakes off his cloak of anonymity to fire one from 18 yards at Robinson's goal. It goes wide right, but not by much.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>64 mins:</strong> Another bad offside decision as Emerton sprints into space down the left but the linesman hauls him back with his big yellow flag. This is still a drab match, getting drabber, as Benni McCarthy replaces Matt Derbyshire and I hope for a moment of magic to liven it all up.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>66 mins:</strong> Blackburn have now reverted to 4-4-2 and McCarthy will play up front alongside Santa Cruz, whereas previously Derbyshire had been forced to play wide left.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>68 mins:</strong> The gamblers in the office today were talking about taking the overs on this one - three or more goals, as I understand it. I don't think anyone put their money where their mouth was and it's just as well because this is going to be nil-nil. McCarthy breaks down the right, but stumbles and the \"danger\" is cleared.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>70 mins:</strong> Sizzling cross from the left from Villanueva, who I'm declaring man of the match here. He lands it plum on the bonce of McCarthy, who remains massively off the boil and heads wastefully wide.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>74 mins - GOAL! Blackburn 0-1 Middlesbrough</strong><br>Moments after Roque Santa Cruz stumbles over the ball on the edge of the Boro box, the ball finds its way to Afonso Alves in the same position at the other end. Alves's control is impeccable and he takes it down, holds off the challenge of the defender (who has also played him onside) before lashing it past Robinson. That's a good goal, far too good for this shoddy match.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>78 mins:</strong> Olsson goes into the book for chopping down a Middlesbrough player, I know not which. Alves then wriggles forward and tempts McCarthy into scything him down, but the free kick is wasted by a horrible cross. Blackburn have just more than 10 minutes to rescue something here, and don't look like doing so.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>80 mins:</strong> Substitution: Olsson off. Errr, Keith Treacy, a winger I think, on.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>83 mins:</strong> Treacy is indeed a winger and he goes twinkle-toeing down the left, but can't get away from the attentions of David Wheater. Blackburn win a corner, which is squandered in the most profligate of manners, when it's curled out of play direct from the spot.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>85 mins:</strong> Free-kick to Boro is whipped into the box from close to the half-way line and Alves is eyebrows from getting on the end of it. Marvin Emnes replaces Tuncay, whose first-half bicycle kick was spectacular, accurate, incorrectly ruled out for offside, and the only thing he's done all match.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>86 mins:</strong> Treacy wins another corner when Wheater is pulled across to the left and is forced to clear behind. The ball is cleared up the other end where the really quite dreadful Downing has all the time in the world to pick out a pass and picks out the first and only Blackburn defender.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong> 89 mins: </strong>Blur, blur, fuzzy picture, tin-can commentary, boring match. Sorry for the cynicism folks but this hasn't been the most stimulating of 90 minutes for me or you. Three and a half minutes of injury time before we can all forget this ever happened.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>90 mins+1: </strong>Blackburn waste their last-gasp chance when they pull a corner back to the edge of the box and Villanueva shanks it nowhere near the goal. Treacy again tries to work something on the left, but it comes to nowt.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>90 mins+3: GOAL! Blackburn 1-1 Middlesbrough</strong><br>Ha! That'll show me. Blackburn have one more chance when they win a corner on the right. Up trundles Paul Robinson and he powers towards the ball lifted into the near post. Robbo might well have buried it had Benni McCarthy not got there first and angled his header across Turnbull, past gorping defenders and into the net. That's McCarthy's first goal in 512 years and it's good for a point.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>Full-time:</strong> A late flourish earns a point for Paul Ince and Blackburn at home, but the home fans still boo anyway at the final whistle. Boro scrapped and scraped and looked like getting three points for their troubles until the late McCarthy header. And that's that. Thanks for anyone who read this. Don't tell your friends.</p>",
  "<p>Any continental European reading the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/oct/24/sexeducation-education \">new sex education guidelines</a> for British pupils aged 5 to 16 would be struck by the uninspiring and matter-of-fact approach to what remains the most extraordinary experience in human life. Of course, having not been brought up in Britain, my point of view is not that of a former teenager who had to resort to binge-drinking and sarcasm in order to deal with the complexities of love.</p> <p>Teaching kids aged seven about \"how animals reproduce\" will not necessarily help them deal with their own attraction to the opposite sex. Teaching pre-teens about sexual harassment or, as the guideline puts it, helping them \"judge what kind of physical contact is acceptable or unacceptable\" is only going to, at best, inspire careers in law. Finally, telling teenagers about \"the importance of marriage and stable relationships\" and feeding them information about civil partnerships' legal and fiscal rights may not actually help them fall in love.</p> <p>Of course, British teenagers should be taught about contraception, pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases: this is sex education at its most useful. The rest, though \u2013 love, in its many complexities and pleasures \u2013 should be left to literature and cinema. Make it compulsory if you have to. This kind of education will inspire lifelong habits and behaviour which will, naturally, lead to a fall in teenager pregnancies and sexually transmitted disease.</p> <p>For British kids between five and seven, I advise <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betty_Boop\">Betty Boop</a>'s films: the first cartoon character to fully represent a woman. And I mean the pre-censored Boop, where the curvaceous Betty <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFX5-g0tCpI\">fights off suitors</a> with charm and authority or even <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFPVCfQ7uxM\">campaigns to be president</a>.</p> <p>For the seven- to 11-year-olds, there should be obligatory screenings of Singing in the Rain, An American in Paris and The Bandwagon. British kids will discover in those three films a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFPVCfQ7uxM\">world of elegance</a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlvzGT1Ta2w\">climactic sensuality</a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YWBOfsXsDA\">pure joy</a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li9XGprAZtA\">restrained passion</a> and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVGBHqsFR-k\">romantic love</a>. Then, from 11 to 13, make them read Flaubert's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentimental_Education \">L'education sentimentale</a> with whole extracts learnt by heart.</p> <p>Now, the hardcore of love's complexities should best be reserved for the 13- to 16- year-olds. Instead of being told of the merits of marriage and stable relationships, they might find it more useful and certainly more fascinating to know about life through Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T59_wcVJ34w\">Jules et Jim</a>, and about same sex relationships through Claude Chabrol's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vz-S7EyKy_Y\">Les Biches</a>. In the latter, they'll even learn useful chat up lines such as: \"If I can have a bath at your place, then I'll accept your invitation for coffee\" (sounds much better in French: \"Si je peux prendre un bain, je veux bien prendre un caf\u00e9.\") And if, after all this, British kids still have questions about the nature of love, Jean-Luc Godard may provide the final <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHikpdf8ktM\">answer</a>.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Preamble:</strong> How Newcastle fans must love Tottenham. Such is the train-wreck at White Hart Lane, United's own shortcomings have paled by comparison, so much so that draws against struggling Everton and oh-so-inconsistent Manchester City are seen as reason for renewed optimism. They may represent the first green shoots of recovery, but it's worth pointing out that only Spurs - who, remember, have made one of the worst starts in Premiership history - keep Newcastle off the foot of the table. They've won once in the league this season, they've got Joe Kinnear in charge, and today they've got that lovable rogue Joey Barton returning to the squad and no Michael Owen. It ain't rosy.</p> <p>On the plus side, it's 28 years since Sunderland last beat Newcastle at home and the Black Cats have won one of their last six games in the league. \"I am amazed that we could be favourites,\" said Roy Keane yesterday. \"We haven't won in 28 years against them, but we are favourites? Who came up with that?\" I don't know, Roy? Bookmakers? As with all derby games, my money is on the draw at a rather pleasing <a href=\"http://guardian.oddschecker.com/football/english\">12-5</a>.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>And here are those teams:</strong> </p> <p><strong>Sunderland:</strong> Fulop, Chimbonda, Ferdinand, Collins, McCartney,<br>Malbranque, Whitehead, Yorke, Richardson, Cisse, Diouf. Subs: Colgan, Bardsley, Tainio, Chopra, Jones, Leadbitter, Reid.<br><strong>Newcastle:</strong> Given, Beye, Taylor, Coloccini, Bassong, Geremi, Guthrie, Butt, Duff, Ameobi, Martins. Subs: Harper, Jose Enrique, Cacapa, Barton, N'Zogbia, Gutierrez, Xisco.<br><strong>Referee:</strong> Mike Riley (Yorkshire) </p> <p>No Craig Gordon for Sunderland, then, with Hungarian keeper Marton Fulop deputising. Barton makes the bench for the visitors.</p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>Sky's pre-match gubbins:</strong> A quick chat with Niall Quinn, looking (as ever) like the happiest man in the world, a word with Jokin' Joe, who manages not to swear (though he does say 'Christ!' at one point, which could be offensive to devout churchgoes), and plenty of shots of fans, some looking nervy, some chanting and some using hand signals to tell the opposition terraces exactly what they think of them.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>Teams in the tunnel,</strong> stirring strings over the Tannoy</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>To set the scene here on the office,</strong> the sports desk is taking a day trip to the media desk, so I'm surrounded by books entitled \"How the Power of the Crowd is Driving the Future of Business\", various in-trays and post-it notes, and also a Gizmo the Mogwai toy. It's a new experience ...</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>Peep!</strong> And we're off.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>1 min:</strong> Dean Whitehead almost gets on the end of a nicely threaded pass, Newcastle clear for a throw-in which Coloccini heads clear</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>3 min:</strong> Also among the features on the media desk, a mouse in the shape of a pen. Don't judge them, it's just the way they are. All Sunderland early doors ...</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>5 min:</strong> Guthrie - the player who booted Craig Fagan up on the air a few weeks ago - gets an early booking as he arrives late to challenge Dean Whitehead. Mike Riley stamping his authority (that's not the right word, is it?) on the game from the off.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>6 min:</strong> The first scare for Sunderland as Yorke slips and Martins nearly gets his head onto a dinked pass.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>7 min:</strong> Anton Ferdinand comes ploughing through the back of Shola Ameobi to win a header, but gives away a free-kick. It's fully 40 yards from goal, but Geremi still fancies a crack at goal. See if you can rearrange these words to discover what happens: bar, by, miles, the, over, bloody.</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>10 min:</strong> Steven Taylor idiotically/confidently (delete as appropriate) allows the ball to run across the face of goal, but there's no Sunderland player ready to take advantage. On the break, Martins wins another free-kick ...</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>12 min:</strong> ... It's Geremi again, so rearrange this: wall, into, the, shanked.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>14 min:</strong> George McCartney does well to cut a ball back from the byline, but it's straight into Given's breadbasket.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>15 min:</strong> Whitehead again makes a swashbuckling break into the box, but this time Taylor stands firm as Cisse's cross comes in. It was like the Sunderland skipper ran into a brick wall.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>17 min:</strong> Cisse optimistically wangs one at goal, but it's always swinging wide. \"So Joey Barton wants to be a role model. The way this lad Guthrie conducts himself, it seems he already is,\" opines Gary Naylor. Gurthrie and Barton could well be the Newcastle midfield pairing for the bulk of the season, which should be interesting to watch.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Sunderland 1-0 (Cisse 20min):</strong> Malbranque scurries (doesn't he always?) in from the right and shoots across goal. It's such a dire shot that it's heading out for a throw-in, but oh-so-fortuitously Djinkin Djibril is loitering at the back stick to poke home. Certainly lucky, but the Frenchman did well to control his prod - the ball was travelling at some speed.</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>22 min:</strong> The noise when that goal went in was incredible, and Sunderland are back on the attack once more, and again it's Chimbonda and Malbranque causing problems down the right. Duff and Bassong are struggling to cope.</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>23 min:</strong> Geremi finally takes a decent set piece, this time from the corner flag. Whitehead can only flick it on, but Coloccini can't quite get on the end of it.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>25 min:</strong> With Sunderland playing a 4-1-4-1 both full-backs are pushing on and causing problems. It'll be interesting to see if Kinnear has the tactical acumen to combat it. Ameobi tumbles on the edge of the box, Riley isn't interested. Though he probably should have been.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>27 min:</strong> Martins gets free down the right, but Ferdinand stretches out to prevent his cross reaching Ameobi.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>28 min:</strong> Frenetic, frantic stuff in the Sunderland box as Bassong's cross causes panic. Duff is denied but now they've got a free-kick ...</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Sunderland 1-1 Newcastle (Ameobi 30min):</strong> ... which Geremi flights to the far post and Ameobi, free, free as the wind blows, rises to power a header past Fulop at the far post. Ferdinand appeared the culpable defender. Tired cliches about buses all coming along at once spring to mind - that's Ameobi's second goal in two games after a two-year drought.</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>33 min:</strong> Nicky Butt disappears down the tunnel for a pain-killing injection. Seems Barton could be making an appearance rather shortly. Kinnear has made his tactical tweak, shifting Martins wide right and going like-for-like.</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>35 min:</strong> Bassong, whose seems the defensive degradation disease that has been hanging around Newcastle for the best part of a decade, gets caught under a long ball and allows Chimbonda to get in behind. Bassong recovers, Chimbonda goes down, but it's only a corner.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>37 min:</strong> At the other end Geremi whips in a corner and Fulop punches unconvincingly. Newcastle force another corner, which again Fulop punches. Kinnear's reconfiguration of his side seems to have done the trick.</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>40 min:</strong> It's all got a little scrappy, with Newcastle almost visibly growing in confidence. But Cisse wins a free-kick out wide ...</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>41 min:</strong> ... Whitehead floats it in. Coliins heads it up in the air. Given catches comfortably. Ho, and indeed, hum.</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>43 min:</strong> Duff has a pop at goal on the volley, but Fulop grabs it gratefully in his midriff.</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>45 min:</strong> Free-kick. Header. Free-kick. Pass. Pass. Pass. Lump it. Header. Free-kick. Pass. Throw-in ... the blood and thunder of the opening 30 minutes has ebbed away, leaving a fairly stodgy, unattractive affair in its wake.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>Half-time:</strong> Riley calls time on the first half. \"I see your picture is of the new Antony Gormley sculpture,\" writes Ian Copestake, \"which I believe is called 'clock of the North'.\" I just like the fact that the ducks seem to be checking the time.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>Some sad news:</strong> Somebody has stolen my mug. MY mug. Whoever it was, I have a message for you ...</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>I WILL FIND OUT WHO YOU ARE. I WILL HUNT YOU DOWN. AND I WILL HAVE MY VENGEANCE.</strong> (Then I might enjoy a cup of tea.)</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>It strikes me that the mug may have been taken hostage</strong> and that I may start receiving little chips of porcelain in the post unless I pay some sort of ransom. I'm with Mel Gibson on this one. What? You've never seen the film Ransom? Gibson? Russo? Sinise? Lindo? Schreiber? Rent it now. You won't regret it. And, whoever, has my mug, pay particular attention to the fate of the hostage takers. Crime doesn't pay.</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>\"Are you allowed to talk about the 'other' match</strong> on at the moment,\" wonders Ian Copestake, \"or are you emulating the good old days when the BBC refused to acknowledge the existence of any game covered by ITV?\" I'm working under the assumption that everyone reading this is trying to avoid the score at Goodison, Likely Lads-style. If not, you can just click <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/matches\">here</a>.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>Peep!</strong> We're back once more.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>46 min:</strong> Taylor misjudges a long ball in the wind. Hand-ball. Dangerous free-kick. 25 yards out ...</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>47 min:</strong> ... Richardson, who took a couple of crackers at Fulham last week without reward, touches it to Cisse, who proceeds to lace it wide.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>49 min:</strong> I haven't made enough of a point about this - it is very, very breezy up at the Stadium of Light. Litter is rolling across the pitch like it used to in an 80s arcade beat-'em-up. Diouf, who's had a quiet game thus far, curls a cross/shot wide.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>51 min:</strong> Cisse attempts an acrobatic overhead kick (which is something of a tautology), but can only hook the ball over the bar. Down at the other end, Martins shows superb technique to hammer a shot on the turn, but it's also nowhere near the target.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>53 min:</strong> Pascal Chimbonda feathers Obafemi Martins undercarriage with his boot. Martins reacts like someones shot him in the nether regions with a cannon. Free-kick, cleared.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>55 min:</strong> \"Just use one of the Media Desk mugs - you know, the ones in the shape of the Olympic 2012 mascots - and stop your whinging,\" suggest Sean Boiling, a man who has clearly never felt the pain of mug theft, despite the tea-making connotations of his name. Malbranque tries to wriggle some space on the edge of the box, but the much-maligned Coloccini, who has played pretty well today, nips in to clear.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>56 min:</strong> Another high ball is misjudged by a defender, this time it's Ferdinand, but he recovers to snuff out the chance. Malbranque then breaks and his cross just evades Richardson. This is much more like it.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>57 min:</strong> Yorke trudges off, and Kenwyne Jones, making his first appearance of the season, comes on. Attacking switch from Keane. Your move, Joe.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>59 min:</strong> Big chance for Newcastle! Butt picks Richardson's pocket in the midfield, feeds Martins who in turn slips it to Ameobi. The big striker does everything right, checks inside, but then puts his shot high and wide, with Fulop at his mercy.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>61 min:</strong> Cisse nearly wraps his foot around a cross, but his shot bobbles wide.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>62 min:</strong> Joey Barton isn't on the pitch yet, but he's already making trouble. Sunderland fans start baiting him as he warms up, so much so that the police try to step in. Barton is told to warm up somewhere else, but rather than walk away he tries to shake hands with the fans, further fanning the flames. Berk.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>63 min:</strong> Malbranque again finds space to stretch his legs, and a few passes later, Richardson has a half-chance that he volleys wide. It's been a belting second-half so far.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>65 min:</strong> Butt's dinked pass into the box almost finds Martins, but Fulop claims. At the other end, the ball drops to Malbranque who wildly shoots over as the ball drops on the edge of the box. Some of the shooting this afternoon has been decidedly average.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>66 min:</strong> Nothing to see here.</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>67 min:</strong> Or here.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>68 min:</strong> Yes, bit of a quiet patch this.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>70 min:</strong> Martins shows dazzlingly quick-feet to get the ball to Ameobi, but he can't match his strike partner's deftness. Gutierrez is set to make an appearance for Newcastle.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>72 min:</strong> Lovely first time one-two between Jones and Diouf forces Butt to deliver the sort of cynical trip on the Senegalese forward that I thought they outlawed in the 80s. Free-kick to Sunderland, right on the edge of the area, within the D ...</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>GOAL! Sunderland 2-1 Newcastle (Richardson 74 min):</strong> ... it's a howitzer from Richardson! A glorious strike, swerving one way, then the other, and still rising as it bulges in the top corner. After his disappointment at Craven Cottage last week, that was an emphatic response.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>76 min:</strong> Jones <em>almost</em> puts the game out of reach with a towering header. The visitors are rocking now ...</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>77 min:</strong> Martins' heavy touch wastes an excellent position for Newcaslte, with Gutierrez and Ameobi both well forward and well placed. Down the other end it's a corner. Breathless stuff again ...</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>78 min:</strong> ... until Whitehead humps the corner straight out of play, that is.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>80 min:</strong> Has everyone at the Stadium of Light brought a carrier bag with them? There seems to have been hundreds tumbleweeding across the pitch. Gutierrez again slinks forward menacingly, but Ameobi uses his hand to control the pass.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>82 min:</strong> Cisse rips in a shot from the angle which zips over the bar with Given pawing at thin air.</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>83 min:</strong> POST! Brilliant effort from Cisse, Given's beaten, but in pings off the inside of the post and out for a goal kick.</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>85 min:</strong> Here comes Barton, on for Butt. \"Boooo!\" say 50,000-odd Sunderland fans. His myriad off-field misdemeanors have utterly obstructed the fact that he used to be a ruddy good player. Not much time to influence things here, though.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>86 min:</strong> It's pretty much been all Sunderland since the goal, but Duff wins an attacking throw. Tainio comes on to reinforce the midfield, his former Tottenham team-mate Malbranque makes way.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>87 min:</strong> Ameobi attempts a cross - never his strong point - but it floats hopelessly out of play.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>88 min:</strong> Gutierrez wins a corner ...</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>89 min:</strong> ... Barton whips it in, headed away. Sunderland fans breathe a sigh of relief. Tick, tick, tick ...</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>90 min:</strong> Three minutes added time to play.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>90+1 min:</strong> Duff lets the ball bobble away for a goal kick. Tick, tick, tick ...</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>90+2 min:</strong> Collins hammers the ball away. Tick, tick, tick ...</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>Peep! Peep! Peeeeep!</strong> It's all over! Sunderland end their 28 years of hurt and what a goal it was to win it. The Black Cats go sixth, Newcastle remain propped up by Tottenham. There's a bit of a scuffle down near the away end as opposition fans square up to one another and stewards pile in, but such is Sky's desire to skim over these things and preserve the Premier League's gleaming facade, we quickly go back to Richard Keys in the studio. \"It's such a shame - it's been such a long time since we've seen trouble in a football ground,\" opines Keys, head buried firmly in the sand.</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>Be sure to head over to the Sport Blog</strong> where Louise Taylor will be offering her view of proceedings.

  "<p>When people look back over Labour's years in government, they will rightly ask how they could spend so much on the NHS without managing to make significant improvements to the care patients receive. The most damning indictment of this failure has been <a href=\"http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.com/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080910/text/80910w0023.htm\">the rise of deaths due to hospital superbugs</a>. Under Blair and Brown deaths from C-diff have increased eight fold, while deaths from MRSA have gone up by 400%. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.hpa.org.uk/web/HPAwebFile/HPAweb_C/1194947311070\">The cause of the problem is clear</a>; three-quarters of hospitals do not have sufficient facilities to isolate patients with infections, they lack the single rooms which are so essential to tackling the problem. </p> <p>Most of the hospitals opened in recent years don't even have the 50% of single rooms the government said they should. The situation is made worse by the fact that, because of Labour's bed cuts in recent years, <a href=\"http://www.performance.doh.gov.uk/hospitalactivity/data_requests/download/beds_open_overnight/bed_08_detail.xls\">hospital wards are now overcrowded</a>. New figures show that patients who are treated on hospital wards with an unacceptably high level of overcrowding are around 20% more likely to contract a hospital acquired infection. </p> <p>But the government's response to this crisis has been exactly the one we have come to expect: following failure and its exposure comes dithering, denial and a moving of the goalposts.</p> <p>In September, <a href=\"http://www.hpa.org.uk/webw/HPAweb&amp;HPAwebStandard/HPAweb_C/1221722380000?p=1204186170287\">the government claimed it had hit its target of halving the number of MRSA infections in England</a>, when actually all it had achieved was a statistical sleight of hand. By picking the three month period with the lowest number of infections and using that as an \"average\" for the whole year, it claimed victory, which conveniently came in a time of political difficulty, just before Labour's party conference. </p> <p>Rather than tackle this pressing and substantial problem, the government has instead resorted to spin and obfuscation. But it doesn't need to be this way. While deaths from hospital acquired infections have rocketed in England, other European countries such as Sweden, Finland, the Netherlands and Denmark have managed to keep MRSA levels at rock bottom.</p> <p>The government's legacy on infection control was written when, in the first year of Labour rule, nearly a quarter of NHS trusts saw a decrease in the number of isolation side-rooms \u2013 often because <a href=\"http://www.nao.org.uk/publications/nao_reports/9900230.pdf\">more office space was needed for the burgeoning numbers of bureaucrats</a>. </p> <p>Time and again over the last decade, the government's own advisors have called on the government to urgently increase the number of single rooms. Yet, with record amounts of taxpayer's money being poured into our health service, the best that the government could come up with to tackle this massive problem was gimmicks like Gordon Brown's one-off deep cleaning programme. Little wonder then, that the latest <a href=\"http://www.healthcarecommission.org.uk/_db/_documents/0708_annual_health_check_overview_document.pdf\">Healthcare Commission report</a> revealed that three in 10 hospitals still fail basic hygiene standards. </p> <p>I am determined that the NHS will be equipped to deliver the fundamental healthcare standards of dignity and safety. Within five years, under a Conservative government, single rooms will be available for all patients who need one on the grounds of medical safety or to maintain personal dignity.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.com/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080910/text/80910w0023.htm\">Nearly 37 000 people have lost their lives to hospital superbugs under Labour.</a> We are determined to make sure that no more NHS patients die needlessly.</p> <p>This will mean a significant increase in single rooms across the NHS specifically reserved so that patients who have, or are suspected of having, a hospital infection can be immediately isolated.</p> <p>Patients are not interested in hearing politicians talk about politically-manipulated top-down targets. They know that all too often the figures are fiddled and the facts massaged. What they want to know is that the quality of their care will be dictated by the evidence, clinical judgment and their own priorities. Their priority is to be certain that in their hour of need the health service will provide those most basic rights of all patients \u2013 safety and protection from infection.</p> <p>It is generally accepted that the quality of the life of a nation can be measured by the way it treats those who are most dependent upon the care of others. Where Labour has failed to honour repeated promises to patients, we will ensure that patients can be certain they are protected against cross-infection. It represents a major step forward in combating infections like MRSA and Clostridium-difficile. It also means that we care about the care we give to the people of this country.</p>",
  "<p>The current financial crisis has been manufactured in company boardrooms. Its authors include the best executive directors, non-executive directors, accountants, lawyers and sundry business advisers. Most directors received profit-related remuneration. Innocent stakeholders lost savings, investments, jobs, homes and pensions. </p> <p>Among many reckless acts, bank executives used depositors' and investors' monies to place clever bets on the movement of interest rates, exchange rates, commodity prices and virtually everything else. They borrowed heavily. At some banks, for every \u00a31 of shareholder investment, directors borrowed \u00a333 \u2013 inother words, they had a leverage ratio of 33:1, meaning that just over 3% of the company was financed by long-term funds. This meant that if the value of the bank's assets declined by just over 3%, the bank would technically be bankrupt. Many banks had even higher leverage ratios. With the full approval of auditors, most of them reported toxic assets as good. They also moved more than $5tn of assets and liabilities off balance sheet. All this helped to improve earnings and maximise the profit related remuneration of bank directors. There is a clear conflict of interests between the interests of directors and wellbeing of business stakeholders. It is difficult to see how the directors exercised reasonable care, skill and diligence in devising their policies.</p> <p>Successive governments have been too keen to shield their friends from public scrutiny. No independent inspectors were appointed to investigate failures at <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3077718.stm\">Polly Peck</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2003/may/31/uknews\">The Accident Group</a>, Bank of Credit and Commerce International (<a href=\"http://visar.csustan.edu/aaba/BCCICOVERUP.pdf\">BCCI</a>), or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/may/26/business.politics\">Versailles Group Plc</a>. Such is the hold of deregulationist philosophies that the Department of Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (BERR) does not even have an in-house unit to investigate major corporate abuses. It outsources that function to major <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/07/creditcrunch.banking\">auditing firms</a>, the very firms which have given a clean bill of health to the accounts of distressed banks. </p> <p>Abuses by big names in the City have been flagged before. For example, a 1997 government report on <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/34910.stm\">Guinness plc</a> found \"firstly, the cynical disregard of laws and regulations; secondly the cavalier misuse of company monies; thirdly, a contempt for truth and common honesty. All these in a part of the City which was thought respectable\". Yet little has been done to enhance people's rights against executive abuses.</p> <p>Section 171 of the <a href=\"http://www.opsi.gov.uk/ACTS/acts2006/pdf/ukpga_20060046_en.pdf\">Companies Act</a> 2006 states that a director must act in good faith, promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members [shareholders] as a whole and in doing so have regard (among other matters) to \"(a) the likely consequences of any decision in the long term, (b) the interests of the company's employees, (c) the need to foster the company's business relationships with suppliers, customers and others, (d) the impact of the company's operations on the community and the environment, (e) the desirability of the company maintaining a reputation for high standards of business conduct, and (f) the need to act fairly as between members of the company\".</p> <p>Lawyers could use this law to argue that directors have been negligent and harmed the interests of stakeholders. However, directors do not owe a 'duty of care' to any individual shareholder, employee, depositor or any other stakeholder. The interests of stakeholders, such as employees, pension schemes members, suppliers, customers and local communities have been subordinated to the interests of the company. Though the shareholders may bring class actions to sue directors for negligence, the law does not empower employees, pension scheme members or depositors to do the same. Neither an individual shareholder nor any other stakeholder can sue <a href=\"http://oxcheps.new.ox.ac.uk/casebook/Resources/CAPARO_1.pdf\">auditors</a> as they only owe a 'duty of care' to the company, as a legal person. Auditors enjoy too many <a href=\"http://visar.csustan.edu/aaba/RacetotheBottom.pdf\">liability shields</a> and can escape liability even after admitting negligence.</p> <p>The UK is ill-equipped to investigate the current financial crisis, or prosecute its architects. Individual stakeholders have lost property, but are not in a position to sue negligent directors and auditors. Thus the UK state is failing in its duty to protect the property rights of its citizens. There is an urgent need to abandon deregulationist policies and revise corporate laws.</p>",
  "<p>Two people, reported to be the mother and brother of Oscar-winning actor Jennifer Hudson, were found dead in a house in Chicago last night, police said.</p> <p>Officers investigating the deaths were seeking a missing child, who it is also believed might be related to the American Idol finalist.</p> <p>Hudson's publicist Lisa Kasteler said police were investigating deaths of her mother Darnell Donerson and brother Jason Hudson. Police said the deaths appeared to be the result of a domestic incident. </p> <p>The medical examiner's office confirmed one of the victims was a woman in her 50s who was shot in the head and the other was a 29-year-old man who was shot in the chest. At least one of the victims had defensive wounds, according to police.</p> <p>A family member entered the home around 3pm on Friday, found a woman shot on the living room floor and left to notify authorities, police said. Responding officers found a man shot in the bedroom. There was no sign of forced entry.</p> <p>Public records show the address listed to Jennifer Hudson and Darnell Donerson. Police tape blocked access to the large, white house in Chicago's South Side last night, where a crowd gathered outside.</p> <p>Authorities issued a missing child alert for seven-year-old Julian King, and were seeking a 1994 white Chevrolet Suburban. The child is the grandson of the female victim, police said, adding the boy could also be a relative of Hudson.</p> <p>The alert said the child was possibly abducted, and accompanied by a man considered armed and dangerous who was a suspect in the double homicide investigation.</p> <p>Police named the suspect as William Balfour. Public records list one of Balfour's previous addresses as Donnerson's home.</p> <p>The tragedy comes as Hudson, who grew up in Chicago, continues to reach new heights in her career. Her song Spotlight is No 1 on Billboard's Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop charts and her recently released self-titled debut album has been a top seller. </p> <p>She featured in this year's blockbuster Sex and the City and is also starring in hit movie The Secret Life of Bees.</p> <p>She won an Academy Award for best supporting actress in 2007 for her role in Dreamgirls. In an interview last year with Vogue, Hudson credited her mother with encouraging her to audition for American Idol, which launched her career.</p>"
