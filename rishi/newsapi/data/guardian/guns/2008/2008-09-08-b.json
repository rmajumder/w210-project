To this day, all Medevac helicopters and units, regardless of official designation, are referred to as such.</p> <p>When I was shot in May 2007, it was Dust Off that came and rescued me and the other 11 wounded men. It was these guys, who will fly into a firefight when everyone else says it's too dangerous, who picked me up and delivered me to a field hospital (nowadays called a \"casualty surgical hospital\" or CSH, but think M*A*S*H). Shot through the chest, with an exit wound in my back and various internal injuries, I would most certainly have died if it were not for Dust Off. So when I was back on my feet and in Afghanistan six months later, I was keen to meet and thank the crew that had saved my life.</p> <p>I also wanted to tell their story. My understanding of medical evacuation by helicopter came from grainy old black and white photos from Vietnam, in magazines and history books I pored over as a child. When I arrived with the team in Afghanistan, I was greeted with was their reality in full Technicolor. I went on several missions with them, but it was December and things were mercifully quiet. During the lulls, I sat and interviewed some of them. I met Sergeant Schacht, a 24-year-old crew chief. His job was maintenance, to keep his helicopter in the air, but once on the ground during a mission, he becomes responsible for the security of the medic. He told me some harrowing tales, described horrific scenes and talked about some of the people he had helped. He had also watched people, including children, die. He didn't look into the camera much, but instead in the distance seemed to see again the scenes he described so vividly. At one stage, he told me about a horribly injured little girl. He mentioned his own child, and then mistakenly referred to the dying Afghan girl as his daughter. In his mind, it seemed, they had become one.</p> <p>Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is another phrase that first came to the fore in the Vietnam war. It is something I am familiar with, and have purposefully studied. In this young sergeant I saw many of the tell tale signs of early PTSD. But I also saw a strong man who loved his job and was determined to keep doing it. He told me of his twin brother, an infantryman and said that every time he went out to help someone he imagined it was his twin.</p> <p>In July, I was embedded with a Dust Off crew, this time from the 101st Airborne Division. This time it was not so quiet. Over the course a week, I flew several missions a day with them in Paktika province in eastern Afghanistan. These missions were frenetic from start to finish, coming hard and fast, one after another.</p> <p>A mission starts with a \"nine-line\" call. A radio crackles and then a voice bursts into the calm: \"Dust Off 27, we have a nine-line in progress.\" Then a sequence of nine pieces of information giving the crew vital information such as location, number of casualties, types of injury, whether or not the firefight is still in progress. </p> <p>At this point everything else stops. One day we were playing cards and chatting, and in the blink of an eye I found myself sprinting after the crew towards their Blackhawk helicopter. Another day we'd just finished eating in the canteen. The Dust Off crew had been joined by the \"chase bird\" crew, who follow them on all missions. The chase helicopter is primarily there as a backup, to pick up their colleagues if they are shot down. They also carry the dead bodies home, while the Dust Off helicopter serves only the living. A group of young soldiers were laughing and joking, when suddenly the radio interrupted: \"Dust Off 27, nine-line.\" </p> <p>Reacting as one, the two crews leapt up, the scraping of their chairs on the floor and the clatter of the table silencing the kids in uniform at the next table. In fact, the entire room came to a halt. </p> <p>The radio crackled again and delivered more news, the worst these guys can hear. \"It's US, at a POI.\" A POI, or point of injury operation, means that the wounded soldier is to be picked up from the battlefield. These are by far the most dangerous missions, as after a firefight or ambush, the enemy may still be in the area. </p> <p>This was the first time I'd been on board for a US pick-up. Over 80% of Dust Off missions are to pick up Afghans, be they civilians, soldiers or even militants, all of whom receive the same care and attention US casualties. On my first day with Dust Off 27, they picked up two EPWs - enemy prisoners of war - who had been captured after an exchange of fire with an Apache helicopter gunship.</p> <p>On my last day, there was another wounded US soldier, another POI. This time the mission was during daylight, so the risk was even greater. As the helicopter swooped in to land, I saw the crew chief slam a magazine into his gun and pull back the bolt, putting a round in the chamber. As they landed on the arid Afghan soil, the origin of the term Dust Off became apparent. The turbulence caused by the rotors created a \"brown out\" as everything not nailed down was blown into the air.</p> <p>As the dust cloud receded, but with the engines still roaring and the rotors still turning, I saw the wounded soldier. He was standing amongst a group of other soldiers, recognisable by a bloodied bandage around his head and an intravenous drip in his arm. He was lead to the helicopter by his lieutenant, who shook his hand before turning back to the fight, and within moments we were in the air again. The soldier's vehicle had been blown up when his vehicle struck an IED, or improvised explosive device. </p> <p>The pride that these men take in their work is obvious. The effect it has on their mental health is not so clear. As Sergeant Schacht said to me: \"The problem with the Medevac is that ... a ground unit may get into a firefight three, six, maybe 10 times out of that year. But with the Medevac you see the ugly side of war every single day.\"</p>",
  "<p>An Iranian judicial committee has vetoed a law that would have allowed men to take additional wives without the consent of their first wife, state TV has reported. Ali Shahrokhi, head of the parliamentary committee, said it had restored a clause to stipulate that taking additional wives will be conditional on gaining the consent of the first wife. The bill is due to be put to the vote in the parliament next week. Outcry over the original bill forced parliament last week to postpone a vote pending further debate; justice officials said that it would undermine women's rights. </p> <p><strong>AP Tehran</strong></p>",
  "<h2>1. Perception: Do you consider yourself to be a progressive? </h2> <p>\"Oh Gosh \u2026 [long pause] In some ways yes but in others no. We always need to move forward as a society. If you look at education policies we need to be in the forefront, we have got to be progressive. People should be able to live their own lives whichever way they want but families are vital to the cohesion of society.\"</p> <h2>2. Tax: Should David Cameron offer more tax cuts than he has outlined already? </h2> <p>\"We want to raise the threshold of inheritance tax because we think this is an iniquitous tax on families that have already been taxed. I agree with the stamp duty cut.\"</p> <h2>3. Tax: If yes to the above, do you think they should be funded by <br>(a) cuts in public spending, or<br>(b) increases in other taxes</h2> <p>\"No, I don't think public spending should be cut, but it should be addressed, as I think lots of money is going to waste on bureaucracy, specifically in the health service where I know it's a cliche but there are more managers than beds. We want an NHS to do what it was designed to do. It's too early to make assumptions about cuts elsewhere. If you look at this government they have presided over a disaster, the cupboard is bare. We should be developing policies where we have something to fall back on.\" </p> <h2>4. Tax: Should so-called \"green\" taxes increase? </h2> <p>\"No. People in my constituency need four-wheel-drive vehicles and SUVs. They are a necessity not a luxury.</p> <p>\"Nobody should be punished for not recycling their rubbish. We need more policies for developing sustainability and we need to get started on nuclear new build very quickly.\"</p> <h2>5. Tax: As a share of GDP tax is currently around 37%. After four years of a Conservative government would you expect it to be:<br>(a) substantially lower \u2013 at least 2 percentage points<br>(b) slightly lower<br>(c) much the same as it is now<br>(d) higher</h2> <p>\"I would like to think that we would be able to produce tax cuts but it's far to too early to say what level they would be. We don't need higher taxes; people work hard and they know how to spend their money properly.\"</p> <h2>6. Europe: On balance has Britain lost out or gained from its membership of the EU? If it has lost out, should it withdraw? </h2> <p>\"The consolidation of power of the EU has gone too far. It has done some good things, for example for eastern Europe, but we need to start redressing the balance. We are paying in large sums without getting much back. We need to stand up for the UK. That is what this government hasn't done.\"</p> <h2>7. Family: Which of the following statements most reflects your view:<br>(a) The tax system should be reformed to recognise and promote marriage<br>(b) The tax system should help parents regardless of their marital status </h2> <p>\"Yes, I think that statistics show that couples that are married are more likely to stay together and children that are brought up with two parents are more likely to do better. David Cameron has made his views clear on supporting and promoting marriage and I agree.\"</p> <h2>8. Abortion: The House of Commons recently voted to maintain the upper limit of 24 weeks on abortion. Do you believe it should be reduced? If yes, by how many weeks? </h2> <p>\"I am totally opposed to abortion as a matter of principle. I am a Christian but I am opposed. Life starts at the moment of conception and that life should enjoy protection under the law. I am glad there is a free vote on this topic.\"</p> <p><strong>Interview by Mark Gould</strong></p>",
  "<p>Twelve years, 11 months and five days after he was acquitted of the murder of his former wife and her friend, OJ Simpson's freedom is hanging in the judicial balance again at the start of his trial for robbery and kidnapping.</p> <p>Simpson, who appeared at Clark County court yesterday, faces possible life imprisonment if convicted of kidnapping, one of 12 charges that arose from events last September when he challenged two dealers of sports collectors' items in a hotel in Las Vegas. He is alleged to have organised a gang of five other men and used guns to rob the dealers.</p> <p>Simpson has pleaded not guilty to all charges, which also include burglary, coercion and assault with a deadly weapon, and his defence will argue he was simply trying to regain possession of goods that had been stolen from him.</p> <p>As with the hugely publicised murder trial in 1995 in which he was found not guilty of the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman, despite DNA evidence that linked him to the crime, the composition of the jury will be the first important stage of the trial.</p> <p>Selection in the current case began in a courtroom in Nevada from a pool of 250 potential jurors. </p> <p>The pool had already been reduced from 500 using a 26-page questionnaire to filter out anyone holding any bias towards the defendant.</p> <p>In an earlier hearing last November, Simpson told the court: \"As always, I rely on the jury system.\"</p> <p>In the 1995 hearings, dubbed the trial of the century, the defence team used an elaborate process, including an 80-page questionnaire and psychological background searches to produce a jury that included only one white member.</p> <p>A year after Simpson's acquittal, Fred Goldman, Ronald's father, took out civil proceedings against Simpson in which he was found liable for the deaths and ordered to pay $33.5m (\u00a315m). </p> <p>Legal wrangles have continued to haunt Simpson, who now lives in Miami, including a furore in 2006 over a book he wrote, If I Did It, which was billed as a hypothetical account of what would have happened had he committed the murders.</p> <p>Once the latest trial gets fully under way, the selected panel of 12 jurors and four reserves will hear the prosecution case that on September 13 last year Simpson, together with five others, burst into the hotel room and robbed the sports dealers at gunpoint. </p> <p>Four of the five men will be giving evidence against Simpson, having struck plea bargains with prosecutors in return for a lesser sentence.</p> <p>The fifth, Clarence Stewart, is also awaiting trial.</p> <p>Simpson's main defence lawyer, Yale Galanter, will argue that the witnesses against him are nefarious characters prepared to sell their testimony to the highest bidder. Galanter told the Associated Press that the items Simpson recovered from the hotel room were his own.</p> <p>\"The truth is, these items were not memorabilia. The law has always provided a right, dating back to our founding fathers, to recover personal property.\"</p> <p>The process of selecting a jury could take up to a week. The prosecution will then set out its evidence in a case expected to last at least five weeks.</p>",
  "<h2>1. Perception: Do you consider yourself to be a progressive? </h2> <p>Progressive.</p> <p>\"It's a new generation who believe in opportunity for all and respect. I'm not your stereotypical Conservative in the sense that I grew up on a tough council estate in Banbury, with my mother putting up an election poster of Jim Callaghan in 79 \u2014 a fact I'm extremely embarrassed about!\"</p> <h2>2. Tax: Should David Cameron offer more tax cuts than he has outlined already? </h2> <p>\"We're open to much more scrutiny in that when Cameron announced two cuts, lo and behold, they suddenly reappear in the [current government's] agenda. That's the good thing about Cameron \u2013 he's shown himself to be a strong leader. Do I think people should choose how they spend their own money? Yes I do.\" </p> <h2>3. Tax: If yes to the above, do you think they should be funded by <br>(a) cuts in public spending, or <br>(b) increases in other taxes</h2> <p>\"In the end, I'd like to see cuts in public spending. There's a lot of waste that could be freed up without hitting front line services. But has the pendulum swung too far? Look at John Prescott \u2013 who's office had five press officers who released three press releases a year. We have a girl who produces three releases a day. This is a great example of that waste for me. There are 3,000 press officers in government \u2013 let's lose 2,500 of them and put 1,500 nurses into hospital for that money.\"</p> <h2>4. Tax: Should so-called \"green\" taxes increase? </h2> <p>\"I want my child, who isn't a year old yet, to grow up on a world that is safe and clean. I want the pregnant mother-of-one down the road to give her child the best food, organic, if that's the best. Let's just raise the basic threshold at which basic tax starts. We should keep the revenue from oil prices and divert that back into green energy \u2013 wind, wave etc. To me, in solving our energy crisis, tough decisions need to be made. Would a new wind farm spoil a beauty spot in Derbyshire \u2013 yes, but it's a necessary evil.\"</p> <h2>5. Tax: As a share of GDP tax is currently around 37%. After four years of a Conservative government would you expect it to be:<br>(a) substantially lower \u2013 at least 2 percentage points<br>(b) slightly lower<br>(c) much the same as it is now<br>(d) higher</h2> <p>\"I have never really sat down and thought about percentages. But working for a US software company, and very closely monitoring the dollar, we have to keep an eye on our global competition. Its not just about tax \u2013 we need to put money into research and development.\"</p> <h2>6. Europe: On balance has Britain lost out or gained from its membership of the EU? If it has lost out, should it withdraw? </h2> <p>\"I also keep an eye on the European operation. At my US-based company, I notice their desire to invest in each of the different countries in the EU. They find it very difficult to invest in France first and Germany, second, and that's because of employment legislation. Out of 14 guys, they'd put 12 in Britain, one in France and one in Germany. The truth is, we need to gain a connection with the electorate. But global trade helps ease the tension, helps us to hold each other to account.\"</p> <p>\"We shouldn't reform the CAP, we should scrap it. My view is that we signed up to a common market, not political union.\"</p> <h2>7. Family: Which of the following statements most reflects your view:<br>(a) The tax system should be reformed to recognise and promote marriage<br>(b) The tax system should help parents regardless of their marital status </h2> <p> \"The average child sees their father for 18 minutes a day and we have a system that rewards and therefore encourages two people to live apart. That's crazy. Married couples shouldn't be penalised. Should same sex marriage be able to adopt, should they have the same tax (reforms)? Sure. The quality of parenting is the key here.\"<br> <br></p> <h2>8. Abortion: The House of Commons recently voted to maintain the upper limit of 24 weeks on abortion. Do you believe it should be reduced? If yes, by how many weeks? </h2> <p>\"Coming from a poor estate, I've seen many girls get pregnant. I absolutely believe in a woman's right to choose. But is the current limit too high? Yes \u2013 I'd go between 20-22 weeks.\"</p> <p><strong>Interview by Johnny McDevitt</strong></p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling will today try to mollify an angry and disillusioned TUC, which wants Labour to act to help millions of low-paid workers facing massive rises in fuel and food prices.</p> <p>The chancellor is due to address the annual congress this afternoon and will face a barrage of hostile questions on the government's policy to hold down public sector pay, and its failure to introduce a windfall tax on energy companies or extra taxes on the super-rich. </p> <p>Darling is expected to promise to do \"everything we can to help families struggling with rising household bills\", but warn that, while he is prepared to accept some increase in borrowing, he cannot put the economy at risk - thus hinting he is unlikely to agree to higher public pay.</p> <p>TUC officials were yesterday filtering a rush of questions to Darling, removing the offensively worded, but trying to make sure they covered the issues raised.</p> <p>Later, in private, Brown is addressing tonight's TUC dinner, and is expected to face blunt words from Brendan Barber, the general secretary, and Dave Prentis, this year's TUC president and leader of Unison, on the government's failure to connect with the needs of ordinary people.</p> <p>The anger among delegates was reflected yesterday in strong support for a motion calling for one million workers to take industrial action, and pledging the TUC to a national demonstration over the 2% pay policy for public-sector workers.</p> <p>Keith Sonnet, deputy general secretary of Unison, accused the government of \"shabby treatment\" of nurses, teachers, civil servants, cleaners, and other workers, and said ministers listened more to their \"fairweather friends\" in business. </p> <p>Brian Caton, of the Prison Officers Association, accused ministers of lying on pay, after they intervened to stage a recommended award to members: \"Let us hurt them - that's the only way we'll get fair pay.\"</p> <p>In a debate on energy today Tony Woodley, joint general secretary of the largest union, Unite, will press the government to impose a \u00a31bn windfall tax on energy companies. Yesterday his union released what it called a dossier of disgrace, \"exposing the greed and excess of energy companies\" which had announced big price rises in gas and electricity. Woodley said: \"Our case for a windfall tax is compelling. It is morally right. I say to the government, it's time to do the right thing and protect the most vulnerable in society.\"</p> <p>Publicly and privately, delegates seem resigned to the fact that ministers have only two years to turn the economy around, as a Tory victory in 2010 is seen as inevitable. The leadership is concentrating on changes that could be won in the budget, rather than needing lengthy legislation.</p> <p>At a leftwing Labour fringe event, John McDonnell, MP for Hayes and Harlington, told delegates the party's performance could be \"as bad as the Labour betrayal of 1931\", when the party under Ramsay MacDonald was almost obliterated in the polls. A GMB delegate from Lancashire was applauded at a private meeting of the union's executive when he described gains for workers it won at Labour's policy forum in July as about as \"relevant as the dining list for the return trip of the Titanic\".</p> <p>Other delegates privately say the \"game is up\" for Labour, and there is little likelihood under any leader winning of the next election. Many cannot believe how the atmosphere has changed since the last TUC a year ago, when Brown was riding high in the polls and the Conservative leader, David Cameron, was under threat from his party. They are also determined not to be blamed for a Tory victory. </p> <p>Mark Serwotka, general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services union, not affiliated to Labour, told delegates while moving the motion calling for industrial action over pay: \"No doubt we will be blamed for letting in the Tories, but the fault lies with Gordon Brown and the Labour government. If the Tories win the election, the government only have themselves to blame.\"</p> <p><a href=\" http://image.theguardian.com/sys-files/Politics/documents/2008/09/09/Osborneletter.pdf\">In an open letter (pdf) </a>, George Osborne, the shadow chancellor, yesterday tried to capitalise on this disillusionment by urging trade unionists to join the Conservatives: \"If you care about better jobs and better incomes, forget about the Labour party. It has forgotten about you ... social justice is at the very heart of the modern Conservative message.\"</p>",

Tax: Should David Cameron offer more tax cuts than he has outlined already? </h2> <p>\"George Osborne doesn't know what the balance sheet is going to look like, so we can't say there should be tax cuts at this stage.

Tax: If yes to the above, do you think they should be funded by <br>(a) cuts in public spending, or <br>(b) increases in other taxes</h2> <p>\"If we see tax cuts they will be funded by increases in other areas; we can't afford to be cutting spending in public services. But there has been a huge amount of money poured into public services and the troops on the ground are saying that money has not been spent effectively; what we need to do is look at how that money is spent and managed.\" </p> <p>\"I think if people see that their money is being used to make improvements, if it is being spent wisely, then they are happy to pay their tax.\" </p> <h2>4. Tax: Should so-called \"green\" taxes increase? </h2> <p>\"It's a tricky one. I think the investment we have had in budget air travel, for example, has brought the working man far greater opportunities to travel the world and the EU.

Europe: On balance has Britain lost out or gained from its membership of the EU? If it has lost out, should it withdraw? </h2> <p>\"I am against giving further powers to the EU, but in terms of having a common market it is a very good thing. What worries me is that the Lisbon treaty pushes us that bit further and creates another layer of bureaucracy. It dilutes the power that we should have to run our own country. The fact that Europe is increasingly meddling in our own legal system and with our own legislation does worry me. </p> <p>\"Retreat? That's the million-dollar question.

  "<p>Everybody remembers a favourite school trip - but the reasons are always different. Sometimes it's because the visit brought significant events in history to life in a powerful way. Sometimes a trip was a first taste of independence or the introduction to an activity which has become a lifelong passion. Here pupils, parents and teachers recall the trip which has meant the most to them. </p> <p><strong>Nick Abbott, 11, pupil, Chalgrove primary school, Chalgrove, Oxfordshire</strong></p> <p>\"I recently went on an activity week to Surrey with my school. It was really brilliant. We did rifle-shooting, quad-biking and climbing. There were giant swings and ladders. We all had to work together and help each other through the tasks. We all slept in cabins and because of some of the activities, I managed to conquer my fear of heights. It's a trip I'll never, ever forget. It has changed my life because it was such fun and I learned so much, particularly about myself. It was great to be away with my friends and to not worry about tidying my room.\"</p> <p><strong>Sally Broad, 37, teacher, Heather primary school, Coalville, Leicestershire</strong></p> <p>\"I went on a week-long trip to France when I was 13 and a pupil at Toothill comprehensive school in Nottinghamshire. I don't remember all the places we visited but we had some time in Rouen and a day trip to Paris, where we went up the Eiffel Tower and to Notre Dame. The whole experience left a huge impression on me. It was my first time abroad, and we didn't have a care in the world. I suppose it really shaped my future life because I went on to study French at university and I am now married to a Frenchman.\"</p> <p><strong>Siobhan Halligan, 16, pupil, Archbishop Ilsley school, Birmingham, West Midlands</strong></p> <p>\"My most memorable trip was last year to Germany. It was part of our GCSE history course and we went to Berlin and visited a concentration camp. It really brought the subject to life. It allowed us to draw our own conclusions about what happened rather than learning it from a text book and put everything we had learned into perspective. Also we had a really good group of people on the trip, and the teachers knew exactly where to take us.\"</p> <p><strong>Chris Liles, 35, assistant head, Treviglas business college, Newquay, Cornwall</strong></p> <p>\"I was 14 and a pupil at Stockport grammar school when I went on a two-week lacrosse tour to Baltimore, in the United States, in 1987. I'll never forget the sheer scale of everything - the Twin Towers, the Empire State Building ... Compared with Stockport, where I was brought up, everything seemed huge and it made me realise I wasn't quite as cosmopolitan as I thought I was. It was interesting living with a family for a couple of weeks, who were normal people and not like what we were used to seeing on TV. I think the whole experience really opened my eyes.\"</p> <p><strong>Marjah Ryan, 13, pupil, Newstead Wood school for girls, Bromley, Kent</strong></p> <p>\"My favourite school trip was a three-day residential activity trip to Osmington Bay, in Dorset. We did activities such as archery, rock-climbing and quad-biking. </p> <p>It was great because it was an opportunity to do things we hadn't done before, and learn about teamwork. I wasn't very confident before about things like rock-climbing but now I know I can do it and I really enjoyed the challenge.\"</p> <p><strong>Sue Santoro, 43, former pupil, Sacred Hart high school, Crosby, Leicestershire</strong></p> <p>\"When I was 12, we went on a school trip to Thursaston Country Park, on the Wirral, which is on the coast and the river Dee. It was the most beautiful day. We were doing a project on the fawna and flora of the area. It was only 40 minutes drive from our school but it was so exciting because we didn't have to wear uniform and my friends and I wore our Charlie's Angels T-shirts. I remember the long wooden benches where we sat to have our lunch, which I discovered were still there when I took my own children to the park a few years ago. I live a mile from there now and it hasn't changed a bit.\"</p>",
  "<p>The increasing number and variety of school trips can put an unwanted burden on teachers' shoulders, prompting many schools to appoint an educational visits co-ordinator (EVC). Often a senior member of staff, the EVC takes charge of risk assessment and health and safety issues and can be responsible for training and organising the vetting of adult volunteers accompanying the children. While many of the roles may appear bureaucratic, the job brings huge professional satisfaction including the chance to see pupils in a new light. </p> <p>Ann Provan, deputy head at the all girls' comprehensive Copthall school in Barnet, North London, explains what being an educational visits co-ordinator means to her: \"I took the role of educational visits coordinator on when one of my colleagues left - it has to be someone from the school leadership team.There is a tradition here: our aim is to get every girl, whatever her family's social or financial circumstances, to go away on a residential trip at least once during her time at the school.</p> <p>\"All the visits are planned out and a risk assessment is carried out. It's quite lengthy. Somebody's got to visit the location - that can be delegated - then we have to cost the trip, with the accommodation, food, insurance and staff cover. I ask for staff volunteers and look at that with the headteacher. We look to balance the staff with a mix of ages and experience, maybe someone who has been there before. And we are always looking to train up newly-qualified teachers and teaching assistants.</p> <p>\"We send out information to the parents and ask about the girls' diet and medical conditions. About a month before the trip, we have a parents' meeting, to discuss the trip, our policies and expectations about behaviour - and the commitment we make as staff, emphasising health and safety. And we have a meeting for the girls - we talk about not bringing huge suitcases and their wardrobe.</p> <p>\"If it's a foreign trip, we have to check all the girls' paperwork and passports well in advance - a number have problems with their passports and some need visas. We always do an evaluation: what went well, what could work better.</p> <p>\"I go on a fair few trips, we've got so many. We have a five-day trip to Scarborough for year 7s - they visit Pickering Castle, a farm, Riveaux Abbey, York Minster and a folk museum. There are evening activities, they swim, walk on the beach and generally chill out. They get fun and culture. They stay in a hotel with a proper dining room, with a sit-down dinner - so many children don't get to eat together as families in the evening.</p> <p>\"I love going away with the girls. You come back knackered but you never feel the same about that group of girls again. You see them again in school - and it's a special relationship.</p> <p>\"It's also wonderful to meet the coaches when they come back. The girls are tired and happy, they come bouncing off the coaches, they're smiling. It's a big ask for the staff, being away from their families for five days, but it's very good for staff morale and well-being, and for creating a good ethos. Education is about more than being in a classroom.</p> <p>\"Teachers need to be brave about school visits. There has been a lot of bad press and we've become a society where people are reluctant to take a calculated risk. But you do a risk assessment and think through every angle of what could go wrong - and then go for it.\"</p>",

  "<h2>All the charms of a new school uniform</h2> <p>Have high street school uniforms gone too \"bling bling\" this year? Brigette Bright, a parent from south London, thinks so. She's unhappy that Marks &amp; Spencer - yes, you heard - has introduced girls' school trousers with a - gasp! - diamante charm. And let's not even get started on the hooded tops.</p> <p>\"It's far too bling and yobbish, not smart at all,\" says Bright. The children \"are dressing for school, not as extras in music videos\". No doubt she'd level the same accusations at Asda, which has introduced girls' boot-cut trousers with a butterfly charm into its designs this September. Those shopping for girls' tunics might spot a flower on the zip of one of John Lewis's numbers, too.</p> <p>Brian Lightman, head of St Cyres school in Penarth and a past president of the Association of School and College Leaders, says: \"If the uniform starts turning into a fashion item, it will not meet school requirements and will undermine the whole process. Uniform is precisely that - it means everyone wears the same.\"</p> <p>M&amp;S can't understand the fuss. \"The 'hoodie' is a navy blue, cotton, zip-through cardigan and the 'bling' trousers are a standard pair of trousers with a 1cm charm on a discreet belt loop,\" a spokeswoman says.</p> <p>Asda says charms on its uniform are nothing new, and John Lewis says the \"flower zip\" on its gingham summer dress last year was a hit with customers.</p> <p>For parents worried that bling could turn their little darlings into \"gangstas\", there's always a blazer, shirt and skirt from Woolworths. Woolies has withdrawn its pinafores with diamante from last year because, its spokeswoman says, customers \"were telling us they don't really want this for school\". But, like the others, it has caved in to teen insistence on fashion in the classroom, opting for \"puffball-sleeve shirts\" and tank tops.<br><strong>Jessica Shepherd</strong></p> <h2>Will Jedi mind tricks attract male students?</h2> <p>There's one minority universities have neglected in their attempts to diversify their mix of students: the Jedi knights.</p> <p>Until now, that is. Followers of Star Wars are being targeted as part of a widening participation programme at Queen's University, Belfast.</p> <p>The university is running a one-day course, Feel the Force: How to Train in the Jedi Way, on November 15. Course tutor Dr Allen Baird hopes to entice Star Wars fanatics on to campus with the promise of classes in the psychological techniques behind Jedi mind-tricks.</p> <p>Students won't be provided with light sabres, but they can expect discussions on the \"philosophical issues\" behind the Star Wars universe: fatherhood, fascism, balance, destiny, dualism and bureaucracy.</p> <p>Baird, whose day job is to teach bosses and employees time management and \"emotional intelligence\", says the workshop is intended to get people interested in studying who might otherwise find it \"scary\".</p> <p>His other one-day workshops at the university - on body language and creativity - tend to attract female students over 40: \"I'm looking to encourage men in their 30s to learn too.\"</p> <p>Baird says they don't really have to be Jedi followers. But there are things to be learned from the way Jedis fight negative emotions, such as anger, and confront their dark sides, he says. \"I'll be looking at how psychology can help us to control these feelings and even turn them to our advantage.\" </p> <p>In the Star Wars universe, the concepts of \"flow\" and \"mindfulness\", which Baird translates as \"focus\" and \"concentration\", are very important. \"They are subjects of serious research in real life,\" he says.</p> <p>While \"Jedi academies\" exist in the US, the Queen's course is thought to be the only one of its kind in the UK.<br><strong>JS</strong></p> <h2>What we learned this week</h2> <p>The exam board AQA made a fool of itself by banning a Carol Ann Duffy poem about a potential knife attacker.

As Shelley said, poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world.\"</p> <p>They can't be banned, but private universities and colleges certainly seemed to be on Universities UK's list of undesirables. It warned vice-chancellors that they were facing increased competition from for-profit US firms.

  "<p>In the reception of the Qualifications and Curriculum Agency, a video is playing, called What Will I Remember About School? It shows groups of pupils addressing an audience that includes the man I have come to London to see, the agency's director of curriculum, Mick Waters. It seems appropriate, somehow, that this omnipresent man should be both upstairs in his office and down here in the reception. </p> <p>My interest in him was sparked by the remarks of several people working in education in Manchester. More than once, a question about an unusual project brought the response: \"Ah, well we used to have this really inspirational chief education officer. Mick Waters. He used to come down here a lot.\" And then, wistfully: \"He's gone to the QCA now...\"</p> <p>Such adulation is rare in the world of education, but it is particularly unusual to find it accorded to someone in a bureaucratic role. It is three years since Waters left Manchester. So what is it about him that keeps people talking so long after his departure? </p> <p>On first impressions, Waters seems less of a whirlwind than his reputation suggests. Relaxed and in shirt sleeves, he cheerfully allows our conversation to overrun our one-hour time slot. Yet his list of responsibilities tells a different story.</p> <p>His first major task, he explains, has been to drive through a reform of the secondary curriculum, giving schools more freedom in the earlier years and introducing vocationally-based diplomas for 14-19-year-olds. During this autumn term, he will oversee the national introduction of those diplomas. Meanwhile, he has also been engaged, with Sir Jim Rose, in a full-scale review of the primary curriculum. </p> <p>So, perhaps less time these days to spend in schools? Not at all, he says. Last Tuesday, he visited Morecambe Bay primary school in the morning and dropped in to Manchester in the afternoon. On Friday, he is due to visit East Sussex. Later he sends me an email exchange with a teacher at Parkwood high school in Sheffield, which ends with an enthusiastic offer from him to entertain year 7s next Tuesday: \"Tickety-boo, Derryth. How many for assembly, do you have PowerPoint ... and can they sing?\"</p> <p>\"At one level, it's about listening to teachers and heads and working out how we can make the whole thing more effective for them,\" he explains. \"But also, when you go to a school, there's a message that goes round other schools: that you're bothered about them, and this isn't simply a bureaucratic organisation that sends things out.\"</p> <p>Waters leaves the impression he is on a mission to empower teachers and give them the confidence to do their own thing: \"The national curriculum lays down the bare minimum we expect children to do, and the real challenge is to put it together in ways that are exciting for them. Sometimes you can teach through a special event or a field study or sports tournament or international visit.\"</p> <p>All this sounded reminiscent of the child-centred, cross-curricular learning that successive governments have tried to drive out with standards, league tables and Ofsted inspections. Was Waters, who trained as a teacher in the late 1960s and who was a head by the age of 28, an early fan of the national curriculum?</p> <p>\"At the time I thought it was hilarious,\" he says, \"that the great and good of every subject went to separate places and decided what should be in and what should be out. The focus has often been on things that can be measured in terms of percentages and numbers, and not on what the child will become in later life.\"</p> <p><strong>Kindred spirit</strong></p> <p>After teaching in Nottingham and two headships in Cumbria, a spell in teacher training at Lancaster led Waters to national school improvement work. During a visit to Birmingham, he came across its then chief education officer, Tim Brighouse, and recognised a kindred spirit.</p> <p>\"I knew of his work in Cumbria, and I knew he was damn good,\" Brighouse told me when I phoned him before meeting Waters. \"When we lost our chief inspector in Birmingham, I was very keen that Mick Waters should apply. I had an intuitive feeling about him when I met him.\"</p> <p>Brighouse, himself famous for his frequent visits to schools, confirmed Waters had done much the same in Birmingham as he does now, calling in before lessons or meeting teachers for a meal in the evening. \"I reckon it must appear he's on the road most of the time, but the reason is he works every hour God sends. </p> <p>\"He's also very good at pulling people up when they haven't got the energy to take things on. They'll say 'you know how it is', but he won't know. He's a very positive person.\"</p> <p>Brighouse said he was disappointed that, when his deputy left Birmingham, Waters did not apply for the job, and line himself up to become chief education officer there. But when I mention this to Waters, he seems surprised: \"Did he say that? Maybe we should have talked about ourselves, rather than sitting there into the night talking about schools, and teachers, and amazing Birmingham. I thought it would create a hiccup in the system if I moved, so I didn't apply.\"</p> <p>Instead he became chief education officer for Manchester in 2002. Innovative projects popped up all over the city, from Manchester Mondays - on which council staff taught in schools - to school attendance lotteries in which pupils stood to win a cash prize if they were present when their name was drawn. </p> <p><strong>Curry house</strong></p> <p>In 2004, using money he had earned from speaking engagements, he invited pupils from local secondary schools to GCSE revision sessions in a curry house. \"The first week we had 19 and we were delighted,\" he said. \"By the fourth week, we had 64. Many of them had never even been in a restaurant before.\"</p> <p>In 2005, he moved to the QCA. I wonder if he is again considering whether to apply for a promotion. The QCA's chief executive, Ken Boston, has been under pressure over the school tests fiasco and in any case is on a fixed-term contract. Would Waters apply for his job? </p> <p>The question is followed by a long pause, then an even longer exposition on what a wonderful educationist Boston is. Finally he manages: \"My enjoyment is in the curriculum and qualification end of it, and I think the board of the QCA would be looking for somebody who brought the broadest of remits. That was particularly evasive, wasn't it? I think it was a no.\"</p> <p>As we talk, Waters is scribbling a long list of people I might like to talk to about him. It includes Rudi Rischer, who was in the first class he ever taught, and now works as an education advisor in Sheffield.</p> <p> \"When I think about my childhood,\" Rischer tells me, \"I think about Mick Waters. He made me feel special. I was an ordinary boy from an ordinary background at an ordinary school - with an extraordinary teacher. He made me love learning and he made me feel everything was possible. He was inspirational.\"</p>",

The film is based on a true story from the 1960s: the real Hanna and McCauley met and had coffee after the former was taking his dry-cleaning into the shop and saw the latter. The scene was shown in this way in Michael Mann's earlier filmed version of the story, LA Takedown.<br><strong>Chris Rogers</strong><br>Edgware, Middlesex</p>",
  "<p>Stock markets were in jubilant mood yesterday after the US treasury announced it was putting the two big beasts of the American mortgage market into \"conservatorship\". Don't be misled by this ugly piece of economics jargon: it's just another way of saying nationalisation - and it was somewhat bizarre to find the equity markets of Tokyo, London and New York, where dealers profess to exalt the free market, whooping for joy at the state taking a grip.</p> <p>The reason for the rise in share prices was pure relief. Just as they were at the time of the run on Northern Rock a year ago this week, just as they were when Bear Stearns went under in March - and just as they were at the end of last week - stock markets have been in a complete funk at the mounting losses from the credit crisis. Hank Paulson, secretary of the US treasury, did not take Fannie May and Freddie Mac into public ownership because he has become a born-again socialist: he acted because he feared a systemic global financial crisis that would prompt the biggest depression since the 1930s.</p> <p>There are five points to note. The first is the sheer scale of the action. Fannie and Freddie together underwrite half the home loans in the world's biggest economy, and the sum involved is of the order of \u00a33 trillion - about double the entire annual output of the British economy. This is the biggest rescue operation since the credit crunch began - but it probably won't be the last.</p> <p>The second point is the duration of the crisis. When markets seized up in August 2007, few market practitioners would have anticipated that central banks and finance ministries around the world would still be firefighting 13 months later. Central banks have cut interest rates; they have pumped money into the banking system; they have agreed to swap worthless mortgage-backed securities for rock-solid government bonds; they have taken failing banks into public ownership. Each time, the markets have rallied in the hope that the latest crisis will prove to be a catharsis - and each time they have been proved wrong. Some analysts do not buy the argument that Paulson's rescue marks the beginning of the end for the credit crunch; some say it was an act of desperation necessitated by the horrendous state of the global financial system.</p> <p>Whatever the motivation, the third point to make is that the government-backed rescue of Fannie and Freddie was right. The length and depth of the credit crunch has validated the views of the International Monetary Fund, George Soros and Alistair Darling that this is the most serious financial crisis the global economy has faced since the 30s. Fannie Mae was set up in that decade as part of the New Deal reforms to help the US economy recover from the depression. With almost perfect symmetry, the decision to take it into public ownership highlights the bankruptcy of the freewheeling model that replaced the much more heavily regulated financial system of the decades after the second world war. Let's be clear: the world is in the mess it is today not because state regulation of the banks was too stringent, but because the state was too timid in the face of demands for deregulation, liberalisation and privatisation. The upshot was excessive speculation, and economies in which the financial sector wields far too much influence and reward structures invite foolishness.</p> <p>As such, the question is what happens now. The fourth conclusion to be drawn is that the free market has no answers to the problem other than to let banks go to the wall. But no policymaker, even those with the most impeccable laissez-faire background, is prepared to let Bear Stearns, Northern Rock or Freddie and Fannie go bust. Some smaller institutions may be allowed to go to the wall, if only to show the US treasury is aware that the bailouts are being financed by taxpayers, but the global financial community now has institutions that are simply too big to fail.</p> <p>But if the big financial institutions cannot - unlike, say, a car company or an airline - be allowed to founder, they also cannot be allowed to conduct themselves in the same way as companies where there really is a risk of failure. Congress will undoubtedly demand tougher regulations for the activities of US banks in exchange for bailing them out, and rightly so. If ever there was a time to bring in controls on the ability of banks to create unlimited amounts of credit, to restrict the more toxic forms of derivatives, to rein in the activities of hedge funds, to insist that remuneration structures are not biased in favour of reckless speculation, and to use anti-trust law to break up the power of the big institutions then this, surely, is it.</p> <p>This leads on to the final point. The credit crunch should be a crisis for parties of the right. They were, after all, behind the campaign to demolish controls on financial markets in the final quarter of the 2oth century. Yet there is scant evidence that either the Republicans in the US or the Tories in Britain will pay a price for the policy errors of the past. In part, that is because in the US the whiff of a return to the soup-kitchen days of the depression brings out the interventionist streak in any administration. In part, though, it is because neither Barack Obama nor Gordon Brown seem willing to seize the social democratic moment. That's dumb politics. It means that what should be a crisis for the right has become a crisis for the left.</p> <p>Larry Elliott is economics editor of the Guardian. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:larry.elliott@theguardian.com\">larry.elliott@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>When it comes to upheaval on and off the field some will always benefit and some will always suffer. Brett Pitman falls into the former category. Signed by Bournemouth from St Paul's in Jersey, his place of birth, at the age of 16, he has always had undoubted talent. But it has taken him time to settle and understand that it is not just ability you need to become a professional footballer.</p> <p>Pitman looked an unlikely first-team regular until financial trouble hit the club. However, players began to leave once Bournemouth received a 17-point deduction in the summer for failing to fulfil the league's terms for exiting administration, and he has stepped up as a result.</p> <p>As I watched him against Bristol Rovers last week, I thought he was carrying an injury as he has a very ungainly running style, but I am assured that is just the way he moves. However, this certainly does not put him off having a nice first touch, particularly as the opening two balls he received were neck-height, and dealt with very neatly. Pitman plays mainly as a second striker, working off the big man, but he certainly holds his own in the air, where his flick-ons for his partner were thoughtful and precise. He also worked hard off the ball to get close to his fellow centre-forward and worked across the line well when the Rovers defenders stepped up, often bending his run and looking for little channels between full-back and centre-half, to be played in. </p> <p>Once he got into these positions, his delivery into the box was very good with either foot, often putting the ball into an area of uncertainty, where the keeper does not know whether to come and get it and the defender, facing his own goal, is uncertain about clearing it, fearing putting the ball into his own net. </p> <p>Pitman showed up well for his team-mate when the ball was played forward in straight lines which can be easy to read for a defender but he rarely let his marker get in front of him, showing good anticipation.</p> <p>Allied to this, his all-round game was safe and secure, rarely giving the ball away needlessly. I would like to see him be more active when not involved in build-up play, particularly around the edge of the box where players need an option rather than being forced to cross the ball into the area under pressure.</p> <p>He was clearly carrying out instructions to close defenders down as he did not let them play across the back but forced the man on the ball to play forward, keeping his options limited to one side. He can make the game look easy at this level and, like most players of his kind, you always wonder if there is something being kept back for a rainy day.</p> <p>Having said that, there is nothing wrong with his work-rate and he threatened to finish off a brilliant move with a rasping drive from the edge of the box. It was an attack which he helped to initiate and then stayed up with as play developed, allowing him his chance of a goal. </p> <p>Brett Pitman may be one of the few to emerge from the ashes of administration. Now it is up to him to make the most of the opportunity.</p> <p><strong>Age </strong>20</p> <p><strong>Born</strong> Jersey</p> <p><strong>Position </strong>Forward</p> <p><strong>Height </strong>6ft </p> <p><strong>Weight</strong> 11st</p> <p><strong>From </strong>Trainee</p> <p><strong>Pace </strong>8/10</p> <p><strong>Shooting </strong>8/10</p> <p><strong>Crossing </strong>8/10</p> <p><strong>Heading </strong>8/10</p> <p><strong>Team responsibility</strong> 9/10</p> <p><strong>Valuation</strong> \u00a3250,000</p>",
  "<p>In a sport that is often suspected of having a microprocessor in place of a heart, it was a minute of marvellous chaos. As Lewis Hamilton and Kimi Raikkonen passed and repassed each other in the dramatic setting of the Ardennes woods, the mind flashed back to great moments from the history of motor racing: Juan Manuel Fangio chasing down Mike Hawthorn and Peter Collins at the old N\u00fcrburgring in 1957, or Gilles Villeneuve and Ren\u00e9 Arnoux banging wheels all the way around Dijon-Prenois in 1979. It was very nearly that good. And then they took it away from us.</p> <p>The stewards' decision that deprived Hamilton of victory in Sunday's Belgian grand prix was an offence against just about everything that makes sport worthwhile. What we had seen, for once, was motor racing in hot blood, the physical expression of the emotions at play in the cockpit of a formula one car. Thanks to a shower of rain, all the usual polished precision was abandoned in favour of gloves-off combat. It was enough to get television spectators leaping to their feet.</p> <p>But no, the men in blazers decided that it had all meant nothing. Applying the strictest possible interpretation and totally ignoring the human dimension of a race that had no need of their interference, they ripped out the joy of the moment and threw it on the scrapheap.</p> <p>When rain started to sweep the circuit with three laps left, Hamilton took immediate advantage. Lying second behind Kimi Raikkonen, he mounted a challenge as the two cars slithered towards the final chicane. Raikkonen braked early and Hamilton drew level. But since the Finn was not ready to concede, the Englishman took the only safe option and cut the corner. Since that gave him an advantage, he knew he would have to back off and drop behind Raikkonen or face punishment. That was exactly what he did. </p> <p>There is nothing in the rules to say how far behind a driver has to drop in such circumstances, or how soon he can make another attempt to pass. So, since he was clearly much the faster of the two, Hamilton ducked out of the Ferrari's slipstream and overtook as they approached the next corner. Raikkonen repassed while they were both avoiding a spinning car, but then the world champion lost control, hit the barrier and opened the way for Hamilton to complete an exhilarating victory.</p> <p>Raikkonen had no complaint. Nor, it is said, did his team lodge an objection, but the three stewards did their job for them by deciding that Hamilton had infringed the regulations. They added 25 seconds to his overall time, enough to push him down to third place, to give Felipe Massa the win and to ensure that the gap between them at the top of the championship table is reduced from six points to two, rather than expanded to eight. </p> <p>The cynical view - and formula one seldom invites any other kind - would be to point out that there are five races left in this season's championship and that a battle to the wire is of greater value to those who hold the sport's commercial rights. Since the closing of the gap will boost interest in Ferrari's home grand prix at Monza this coming Sunday, the decision will also do nothing to dispel the widespread belief that the sport's rulebook is written not just in Italian but in the Modenese dialect. </p> <p>Examples of judgments favouring Ferrari are now too numerous to be dismissed. Most recently, why was a fine against the team the only punishment for Massa's dangerous exit from the pits during the grand prix in Valencia, allowing him to keep his victory, when Bruno Senna, doing exactly the same thing in the GP2 race at Spa, was given a drive-through penalty that cost him a win? It is impossible to avoid the conclusion that if the roles of Hamilton and Raikkonen had been reversed on Sunday, no action would have been taken against the Ferrari driver.</p> <p>It is not necessary to be a fan of Hamilton or the McLaren team, or to harbour a dislike of Ferrari, to see that here is a miscarriage of justice entirely consistent with formula one's current code of practice, in which the rules mean whatever the men in charge want them to mean. </p> <p>It is no coincidence the sport is gradually moving towards wide-eyed new audiences in Russia, China, India and the Arab countries, where formula one means Ferrari and governments are willing to spend their people's money on it, and away from its traditional base in Europe, where - as this weekend's outcry demonstrated - the fans know what they are looking at and can tell when they are being treated like idiots. </p> <p><strong>Dregs rise to the top in an upside-down world</strong></p> <p>The forthcoming film of David Peace's novel The Damned Utd, of which there will be more to say at a later date, includes flashbacks to Brian Clough's days at the Baseball Ground, and to his rows with the Derby County chairman, Sam Longson. In one scene the actor playing Longson delivers a speech which, loosely paraphrased, goes something like this: \"What you've got to recognise, Clough, is that every bloody football club is the same. At the top there's the bloody chairman. Then there's the bloody board. Then there are the bloody supporters. Then there's the bloody team. And at the bottom, right at the bloody bottom, is the bloody manager. Got it?\" </p> <p>Back in 1973, Longson was dead wrong. Thirty-five years later, however, as the dregs rise to the top of English football, his words appear to have come true. Managers now come some way below the assortment of \"technical directors\", \"directors of football\", \"superagents\" and a variety of chancers and conmen whose principal qualification is the knowledge of how, in a virtually unregulated game, to divert a few million quid into their personal accounts from the pockets of potential investors.</p> <p><strong>Any port in a storm for Bernard the bad loser</strong></p> <p>The initials BL stand for Bad Loser, and also for Bernard Laporte. Hardly renowned for his generosity of spirit during his eight years in charge of the France rugby XV, Laporte is staying true to form in his new incarnation as Nicolas Sarkozy's secretary of state for sport, youth and associations. Last week he repeated his claim that France would not resort to what he clearly sees as Perfidious Albion's underhand tactic of focusing their resources on specific sports.</p> <p>\"The strength of our sport is to have been present in Beijing in 22 of the 28 sports on the schedule and to have won medals in 16,\" he said. \"We'll be working to get even stronger, without leaving anyone behind. We'll help the trinquet [an indoor version of pelota] in Saint-Jean-de-Luz or the rugby in Boucau [a town in Aquitaine]. That's our culture.\" And that's his excuse, too.</p> <p><strong>After the gold rush it's back to earth at the airport</strong></p> <p>It's not all open-top bus parades and gold Jimmy Choos. Standing unnoticed in a cattle-class queue at a British Airways check-in desk at Heathrow last Thursday morning was Jason Kenny, unencumbered by the gold and silver medals he won for the team and individual sprint events in the Laoshan velodrome barely a fortnight earlier. He was on his way, he said, to a race meeting in Germany, and wasn't even sure if he was at the right terminal. Life goes on, even for 20-year-old national heroes.</p>",
  "<p>During her period of stardom in the West End and on Broadway, Jennifer Hilary, who has died of cancer aged 65, adorned the acting profession, in more than one sense. Blonde, with pale blue eyes, an equally pale complexion, and a mouth that could subtly move from a knowing smile to conveying hurt, she displayed an emotional range while still young. But what those who knew her will miss most is her gift for lasting friendship and sense of personal style; the actor Barbara Leigh-Hunt remarked that she could tell from the way a room and its flowers were arranged that Hilary had been there.</p> <p>She was born in Frimley, Surrey, but her early years were spent in Cairo, where her father worked for the British Overseas Airways Corporation, supervising flying boats. Hilary then attended the Elmhurst ballet school in Camberley, and, although her height ruled out any hopes of her becoming a ballerina, she retained a love of dance.</p> <p>After training at Rada, where she won the Bancroft gold medal, she made her professional debut in 1961 at the Liverpool Playhouse, moving on to Birmingham Rep the following year. An assistant stage manager at the latter was Tom Rand, later an Oscar-nominated production designer; he and Hilary became friends, and remained so for 46 years.</p> <p>She celebrated her 21st birthday on Broadway, while in Jean Anouilh's The Rehearsal (1963) at the Royale theatre, with Coral Browne and Keith Michell. Her West End debut was in The Wings of the Dove, at the Haymarket in 1964. Later that year, she appeared with Ian McKellen, in his West End debut, in A Scent of Flowers at the Duke of York's, then supported Ingrid Bergman in Michael Redgrave's production of A Month in the Country, opening Guildford's Yvonne Arnaud theatre, in 1965.</p> <p>Returning to New York in 1966, she appeared at the Shubert theatre in John Gielgud's production of Ivanov, starring Gielgud himself and Vivien Leigh. In Britain, she played a 1960s swinger in Alan Ayckbourn's Relatively Speaking, his seventh play but his first in the West End. Michael Hordern, Celia Johnson, Richard Briers and Hilary received outstanding reviews when it premiered at the Duke of York's in September 1967.</p> <p>It was directed by the actor Nigel Patrick, as was her next Broadway venture, Samuel Taylor's comedy Avanti! at the Booth theatre in 1968. She had top billing in this, but missed out on the subsequent Billy Wilder film version. Occasional feature films included Becket (1964) and The Heroes of Telemark (1965) and, in her largest role, in One Brief Summer (1969).</p> <p>Her television work often drew on her facility for intuitive responses to fellow actors. The Woman in White (1966) was a BBC classic serial. In a unique casting device, she played both the dispossessed Laura Fairlie and the title character. Pig in a Poke (1969) was a typically acerbic single play from Simon Gray.</p> <p>In Double First (1988), a low-key sitcom, she starred opposite Michael Williams. Television guest roles included Z Cars (1977), Tales of the Unexpected (1980), Midsomer Murders (1999) and Doctors (2007).</p> <p>Dennis Potter's only play written directly for the theatre, Sufficient Carbohydrate, at the Hampstead in 1983, gave her some good scenes as a sardonic wife. Nevertheless, in Leigh-Hunt's words, \"the theatre was not faithful to her\". She therefore introduced Hilary to the director Philip Prowse, who used her three times, beginning with the sharp Mrs Allonby in his RSC production of A Woman of No Importance (1992), at the Theatre Royal, Haymarket.</p> <p>Again for Prowse, she was the Duchess of Berwick in Lady Windermere's Fan, at the Albery in 1994, before a central role in a revival of No\u00ebl Coward's Cavalcade at the Glasgow Citizens' theatre in 1999. Despite fine reviews for her and Prowse, its large cast made a West End transfer impractical.</p> <p>Hilary was always fond of cats; she adopted her last, from the Celia Hammond Animal Trust, just two weeks before she died. One earlier pet, named Humphrey, accompanied her everywhere during years of touring - together they managed to charm the most hard-bitten of landladies.</p> <p>She is survived by a younger brother, sister-in-law, two nephews and a niece.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Jennifer Mary Hilary, actor, born December 14 1942; died August 6 2008</p>",
  "<h2>1. Perception: Do you consider yourself to be a progressive? </h2> <p>\"Yes, I believe in compassionate Conservatism. I think we should reform the tax and benefits system so that it is fairer and more efficient. For example, I think we should look at tax breaks for working people who look after a sick, disabled, or elderly relative. We should also look at increasing the carer's allowance in order to make it more like a living wage. If people could afford to leave work in order to absorb such family responsibilities then that would in turn have a significant impact on the number of people in nursing care and along with it, government spending. I have long held the view that this makes both moral and economic sense.\"</p> <h2>2. Tax: Should David Cameron offer more tax cuts than he has outlined already? </h2> <p>\"I don't think any of us truly knows what state the public finances will be in until we get there, so Cameron is wise not to be making any promises that he cannot be sure of keeping. I am confident that Cameron will take whatever fiscal measures are necessary in order to stimulate the economy when he becomes prime minister.\"</p> <h2>3.

Tax: Should so-called \"green\" taxes increase? </h2> <p>\"Only if such increases can be offset by decreases in other areas of taxation, particularly taxes on families who are feeling the pinch as the UK economy contracts.\"</p> <h2>5. Tax: As a share of GDP tax is currently around 37%. After four years of a Conservative government would you expect it to be:<br>(a) substantially lower \u2013 at least 2 percentage points<br>(b) slightly lower<br>(c) much the same as it is now<br>(d) higher</h2> <p>\"I do not have a crystal ball, but I am aware that we have significant commitments which will have to be met, particularly to our armed forces, and Liam Fox [the shadow defence secretary] has been right to stick his neck out and say kitting out our servicemen and women should come before any tax cuts. I think it is a historical fact that Conservative governments deliver lower taxes and more efficient public services than Labour and the Liberals, and I see no reason why that would not be the case under a government led by David Cameron.\"</p> <h2>6. Europe: On balance has Britain lost out or gained from its membership of the EU? If it has lost out, should it withdraw? </h2> <p>\"It is well-known that I am not comfortable with our membership of the EU in its current form. We should renegotiate our terms of membership, reclaim powers over fisheries, agriculture, legislation, fiscal policy, self-government, and reassert our status as a sovereign, self-governing nation state.\"</p> <h2>7. Family: Which of the following statements most reflects your view:<br>(a) The tax system should be reformed to recognise and promote marriage<br>(b) The tax system should help parents regardless of their marital status </h2> <p>\"Although I come from a single-parent family I believe the tax system should be reformed to better recognise and promote marriage, as we must accept that a stable married family generally offers the best environment in which to bring up children. If you are serious about tackling family breakdown, then you must shore up marriage. This also offers the benefit of more freedom in society, as a fully functioning family is less dependant on the state, which in turn frees resources to be used for the long-term sick, disabled, and the elderly, who are now facing a cold winter with prohibitive fuel costs.\"</p> <h2>8. Abortion: The House of Commons recently voted to maintain the upper limit of 24 weeks on abortion. Do you believe it should be reduced? If yes, by how many weeks? </h2> <p>\"Naturally, this is a matter of individual conscience. In principle, I support halving the upper limit, from 24 weeks to 12 weeks, particularly as premature babies born at 24 weeks can survive. However, any reduction from where we are now would be progress. I am also not comfortable that abortion can be seen as a method of contraception, although, of course, there are always exceptional cases.\"</p> <p><strong>Interview by Mark Gould</strong></p>",
  "<p>They are supposed to be happy and carefree times, providing experiences and memories to last a lifetime. Which is why when it all goes wrong, questions are asked. What happened? Why did it go wrong? Could it have been avoided?</p> <p>The answer to that final question is almost certainly \"no\", according to school trip providers. These days, when a child tragically dies on a school outing, it is nearly always because of an unpredictable event.</p> <p>It was not always so. When four teenagers drowned in a kayaking accident in Lyme Bay, Dorset, in 1993, the subsequent trial led to the prosecution of the parent company and centre manager, and a conviction for corporate manslaughter.</p> <p>The incident mobilised the government to pass new laws in 1995, creating an independent licensing authority and toughening up guidelines on the organisation and administering of school trips.</p> <p><strong>Careful planning</strong></p> <p>According to figures from the Outdoor Education Advisers Panel and the Adventure Activities Licensing Authority, two or three children on average die every year on school outings against the hundreds of thousands who participate in complete safety. Pupils are actually most at risk from illness, inappropriate attention from strangers and petty crime - either as the victims or perpetrators.</p> <p>So how should schools go about planning interesting, fun, beneficial - but incident-free - outings for their pupils?</p> <p>Every school should have a designated, school visits coordinator, though most now seek the help of one of the many licensed companies set up to run adventure and educational tours.</p> <p>The School Travel Forum (STF) represents 21 companies offering tailor-made educational trips for about 400,000 children a year. They support learning in subjects such as history, art and geography in the UK and overseas, in countries as diverse as France, Iceland and China, costing an average of \u00a3300 per child.</p> <p>Ian Pearson, the STF's development officer, says any risk assessment is the responsibility of the company providing the service. \"They check the hotels, make the travel arrangements, ensure that guides have been vetted and generally ensure the smooth, safe running of the outing,\" he says. \"What they expect the teacher to do is to manage the pupils, and make sure they know who they are taking and that the pupils know how to behave.\"</p> <p>While schools should make a record of any measures they are taking to ensure pupil awareness of safety, these should not be over-complicated.</p> <p>\"Sometimes form-filling gets in the way of common sense. It is the competence of those leading the trip which is paramount,\" Pearson says. \"Generally school trips are safe because teachers are competent at managing children.\"</p> <p>Marcus Bailie is head of inspections at the Adventure Activities Licensing Authority, created following the Lyme Bay tragedy and now part of the Health and Safety Executive. He is responsible for a team of seven inspectors who assess facilities at more than 1,000 activity centres.</p> <p>He agrees that staff competence is the most important safety feature. \"We make sure that activities are relevant and that the correct procedures are in place. Any risk on the visit should not exceed the risk they might experience in real life and must be in proportion to the benefit derived from the activity. We provide that extra reassurance to parents and schools that safety management practice is in place and that, when taking part in exciting and stimulating activities, young people are not put at unnecessary risk.\"</p> <p>All companies that are licensed, or officially endorsed, offer comprehensive insurance cover and are covered to \u00a35m in public liability, including water and winter sports. Extreme activities, such as ski diving, are unlikely to be included, however.</p> <p>Some teachers prefer to organise their own activities, particularly if they involve low-risk visits to local places of interest. Schools wanting to go it alone can get advice and guidance from their local Outdoor Education Advisers Panel (OEAP).</p> <p>Martin Tomlinson, who works for the OEAP in West Sussex, says risk assessment is mostly \"just common sense ... For example, it might be advisable to remind children to bring a bottle of water with them, or to remember their Wellington boots. That is part of the risk assessment process because the teacher is considering the conditions that might be encountered during the visit, and giving pupils a check-list of what they need to do. </p> <p>Teachers shouldn't be fearful but confident about organising such activities. We are here to advise on issues such as adult to pupil ratios and suitable activities.\"</p> <p>The British Activity Holiday Association (BAHA), which runs 200 activity centres in the UK, is supporting a quality-badge scheme due to be introduced by the government in October. It says the scheme will reassure schools that the company has been subject to inspections and is licensed.</p> <p><strong>Integral to learning</strong></p> <p>For most schools, visits will always remain an integral part of the learning process. As Liz Allen, head of Newstead Wood school for girls in Bromley, says, there is no reason why trips should not go smoothly if everyone knows what is expected of them.</p> <p>\"Problems might arise where outings are a bolt-on, for example, an end-of-term visit to a theme park as a reward for hard work,\" she says. \"These trips are more unpredictable and it might be harder to enforce a school's behaviour ethos where pupils are over-excited.</p> <p>\"However, where they are embedded in the education programme of the school, everyone feels more secure and there is a much decreased risk.\"</p> <p><strong>AALA</strong>: <a href=\"http://www.aala.org.uk\">aala.org.uk</a> <br><strong>BAHA</strong>: <a href=\"http://www.baha.org.uk\">baha.org.uk</a> <br><strong>OEAP</strong>: <a href=\"http://www.oeap.info\">oeap.info </a><br><strong>School travel forum</strong>: <a href=\"http://www.schooltravelforum.com\">schooltravelforum.com</a></p>",
  "<h2>1. Perception: Do you consider yourself to be a progressive? </h2> <p>\"Yes. The whole party has moved on. That was recognised when David Cameron became leader.

People didn't want to listen then, but they do now.</p> <p>\"He talks about things that we never dared talk about before, such as environmental issues \u2013 Gordon Brown never spoke about the environment until David Cameron spoke.

Tax: If yes to the above, do you think they should be funded by <br>(a) cuts in public spending, or <br>(b) increases in other taxes</h2> <p>\"What we need to do is safeguard expenditure on schools, hospitals and fighting crime before we offer too much in the way of tax cuts. We need to ensure public services are properly safeguarded before we go down that route. Too often people have equated [Tory] tax cuts with cuts in public expenditure. We have never been successful in convincing people that you <em>can</em> have tax cuts without sacrificing schools, hospitals and law and order.\"</p> <h2>4. Tax: Should so-called \"green\" taxes increase? </h2> <p>\"George Osborne has made it clear that green taxes should not be a substitute for stealth taxes. There need to be positive benefits from any green taxes. The vehicle excise duty increase was nothing to do with the environment and everything to do with taxation by stealth. Any increased green taxes need to be offset by benefits elsewhere.\"</p> <h2>5. Tax: As a share of GDP tax is currently around 37%.

All we can say is that it's important to have a strong economy and good quality public services with lower taxation. I can't see six years into a future; we just don't know what the books are gong to be like when we get in.\"</p> <h2>6. Europe: On balance has Britain lost out or gained from its membership of the EU? If it has lost out, should it withdraw? </h2> <p>\"We have gained but only just because with Nato it has helped secure peace in Europe and that is the biggest benefit. On balance it's in Britain's interest to remain in. Of course if it really ceased to be in our interest we might have to think again.\"</p> <h2>7. Family: Which of the following statements most reflects your view:<br>(a) The tax system should be reformed to recognise and promote marriage<br>(b) The tax system should help parents regardless of their marital status </h2> <p>\"I would like to see marriage recognised in the taxation system. All evidence suggests that children who are brought up in a family unit are healthier and happier and have less exclusion from schools.\"</p> <h2>8. Abortion: The House of Commons recently voted to maintain the upper limit of 24 weeks on abortion. Do you believe it should be reduced? If yes, by how many weeks? </h2> <p>\"I think there should be some more restriction on the legal limit. I think it should be a bit lower than 24 weeks.\"</p> <p><strong>Interview by Mark Gould</strong></p>",
  "<h2>1. Perception: Do you consider yourself to be a progressive? </h2> <p>\"Absolutely. I come from the St Anne's estate in Nottingham, the scene of a lot of this terrible gun crime, and a lot of the Labour polices are so driven by ideology that they have kept people down. We want to create equal opportunity in terms of jobs and education; that's what progressive means. For example in education why should it be done in the same old way? It's all about what works best. </p> <p>\"We think Blair was too moderate. He did what he could get away with; it was a mild version of what he wanted to do. We will go a lot further, not having this nonsense where the unions want to run everything. I am a Nottinghamshire county councillor and we have some of the lowest performing schools. </p> <p>\"We regularly hear councillors at meetings blaming us [the Tories] for the problems. If it wasn't for the Conservatives, I am sure they would blame the Romans next.\"</p> <h2>2. Tax: Should David Cameron offer more tax cuts than he has outlined already? </h2> <p>\"I think we all have a responsibility to pay taxes - that's why we are Tories - but I don't know what we will be taking over when we take over so we can't say too much now about what taxes should be cut. It will be about looking at what the taxes are and who they affect the most. The people on the borderline and the most vulnerable should be helped first. We also need to reform the tax system to make it simpler and more easy to use; there are so many pages it's like the Encyclopedia Britannica. No wonder so many companies are suffering. Where there are tax cuts it's got to be morally right and economically effective.\"</p> <h2>3.

Europe: On balance has Britain lost out or gained from its membership of the EU? If it has lost out, should it withdraw? </h2> <p>\"You look at the amount of money that has been spent in Europe, it's difficult to say we haven't benefited in one shape or form but I think it must refocus on broader issues such as global warming, tackling pollution, rather than telling us our bananas are the wrong shape or having Tony Blair as president \u2013 that's ridiculous.

They are given more incentive to stay apart than live together.\"</p> <h2>8. Abortion: The House of Commons recently voted to maintain the upper limit of 24 weeks on abortion. Do you believe it should be reduced?

  "<h2>1. Perception: Do you consider yourself to be a progressive?</h2> <p>\"Yes, I am progressive. 'Progressive' is about supporting new ideas and social change. I will always listen to new ideas as we often have to look for new solutions to issues as society changes over time. We do, though, have to learn from the past and use history and experience to help make decisions for the future. </p> <p>\"Two of the most progressive ideals are social justice and equal opportunities. I believe in social justice. It is wrong to turn a blind eye to a society which is broken by the injustices of family breakdown, drug and alcohol addiction, failed education and serious personal debt. </p> <p>\"These are the new 'five giants' of our age. I am a progressive because I will work to harness the power of the state, voluntary organisations and social enterprises to work with the people to fight this multiple deprivation which is plaguing our country. Labour believes society's problems can only be solved by the state. That has failed. Society's problems can only be solved by people in local communities. </p> <p>\"I have also campaigned for many years for the Conservative party to get more women in parliament but strongly believe it should be done so based on merit. I believe in creating opportunities for all - no matter who they are or where they come from. I believe in rehabilitation of offenders and working with them to change their behaviour and supporting them on their release so that they do not reoffend. I want to see additional help for those from more disadvantaged backgrounds to get the best education possible, so that they can aspire and achieve their dreams.\"</p> <h2>2. Tax: Should David Cameron offer more tax cuts than he has outlined already? </h2> <p>\"The Conservative party has always been a party of low tax and always will be. I want people to keep more of the money their hard work has earned them. However, with an extremely tough economy ahead of us for the next year, I do not think David Cameron can promise any unfunded tax cuts right now. No-one knows, not even the MPC, how bad the economy will get in the months ahead and therefore it would not be right for David to promise something he cannot deliver. We need to set an example of living within our means. Stability has to be the key right now. The aim will be to cut taxes when the time is right.\"</p> <h2>3. Tax: If yes to the above, do you think they should be funded by <br>(a) cuts in public spending, or <br>(b) increases in other taxes</h2> <p>\"I will always believe in low taxation! We will find money when the time is right to do so, by tackling the current waste of public spending that takes place in government.\"</p> <h2>4. Tax: Should so-called \"green\" taxes increase? </h2> <p>\"As a party we will try and rebalance taxation - shift the burden of taxation away from 'good' things like families and on to 'bad' things like pollution and carbon emissions, so that overall taxes do not increase. Also, I want to live in a community with a good quality of life. In my constituency that means fighting to stop the expansion of Heathrow, and the pollution, noise and congestion that goes along with it.\"</p> <h2>5. Tax: As a share of GDP tax is currently around 37%. After four years of a Conservative government would you expect it to be:<br>(a) substantially lower \u2013 at least 2 percentage points<br>(b) slightly lower<br>(c) much the same as it is now<br>(d) higher</h2> <p>\"It is difficult to say right now as the economic outlook is uncertain. It is uncertain because of the global impact and the credit crunch but also due to the mess that Gordon Brown has made of the public finances. Looking forward, we cannot write the 2014 budget now. What I am concerned about is how to ease the tax burden on hard-working families who are feeling the pinch now. We have already announced some policies which help hard-pressed families, eg cutting stamp duty for first-time buyers on purchases up to \u00a3250k, raising the inheritance tax threshold to \u00a31m and ending the couple penalty in the tax credits system. This is a real difference to what Labour have done. Some of their tax rises have been extremely regressive, eg abolition of the 10p tax band and the increases to road tax.\"</p> <h2>6. Europe: On balance has Britain lost out or gained from its membership of the EU? If it has lost out, should it withdraw? </h2> <p>\"The EU has succeeded in bringing the countries of Europe together to ensure peace and prosperity in a once-troubled continent. The single market and the enlargement of the EU were promoted by Margaret Thatcher. We now have free movement of services, people, workers and goods. But the EU should not have pretensions to intervene in every part of our lives. It should concentrate on doing less, but doing it better. I would want to repatriate some powers back to the UK so that we are more in control of what we do. I would like the EU to do more on free trade with the third world so that we can support countries like Mozambique to be economically self-sufficient. The EU should concentrate on making a difference where they can: global warming, global competitiveness and global poverty.\" </p> <h2>7. Family: Which of the following statements most reflects your view:<br>(a) The tax system should be reformed to recognise and promote marriage<br>(b) The tax system should help parents regardless of their marital status </h2> <p>\"We will aim to help all parents - but we need to address any current issues, eg it is not right that in our benefits system couples receive more money if they live apart. In this way, we will be recognising and promoting marriage.\"</p> <h2>8. Abortion: The House of Commons recently voted to maintain the upper limit of 24 weeks on abortion. Do you believe it should be reduced? If yes, by how many weeks? </h2> <p>\"Yes, it should be reduced to 18 weeks. A baby can be born and survive from about 20 weeks.\"</p> <p><strong>Interview by Alexandra Topping</strong></p>",
  "<h2>1 Perception: Do you consider yourself to be a progressive? </h2> <p>Progressive.</p> <p>\"[David] Cameron's views on social reform resonate with me particularly. I've spent 22 years in education and part of cancer research and therefore probably represent a minority of Tories in that I'm not a banker or work in finance or in the City. I'd consider myself a social reformer and a liberal Conservative, come from a working-class background, I was the first of my family to go to university etc, so in that sense, Cameron's ideas resonate strongly with me.\"</p> <h2>2. Tax: Should David Cameron offer more tax cuts than he has outlined already? </h2> <p>\"It is wise and measured for Cameron to manage tax expectations. It would be foolhardy, like the taking on of a struggling business, to make promises about money. However, I thought George Osborne's announcement on inheritance tax a few months ago is, for me, a flavour of the kind of stances on tax our government will have.\"</p> <h2>3. Tax: If yes to the above, do you think they should be funded by <br>(a) cuts in public spending, or <br>(b) increases in other taxes</h2> <p>\"A lot of public services can be delivered in different ways. There is a waste in the civil services, so we need to start by delayering those services. We need government money, not tax money being fed into the frontline.\" </p> <h2>4. Tax: Should so-called \"green\" taxes increase? </h2> <p>\"The problem is that as soon as you provide a more environmentally efficient product, like a tungsten lightbulb, it costs more. I'm of the opinion that we need to encourage people by offering them incentives \u2013 by using the tax system to make these green issues more equitable.\"</p> <h2>5. Tax: As a share of GDP tax is currently around 37%. After four years of a Conservative government would you expect it to be:<br>(a) substantially lower \u2013 at least 2 percentage points<br>(b) slightly lower<br>(c) much the same as it is now<br>(d) higher</h2> <p>Interview ended before question asked.</p> <h2>6 Europe: On balance has Britain lost out or gained from its membership of the EU? If it has lost out, should it withdraw? </h2> <p>\"Like many post-war, postmodern treaties, like the settlement at the Treaty of Rome, there is a real need to refresh. The movement in the EU for reform is a good and necessary thing. The idea is simple, to do less in Europe, but to manage what we do better. This antiquated club mentality of the present is stopping us from competing with burgeoning economies like Brazil and China, especially when we are looking at things like the CAP [common agricultural policy]. CAP belongs within national governments.</p> <p>\"And we need to let the people have their say. Trust is the issue here \u2013 this government promised people a say on Europe and never delivered \u2013 we have promised them a say and we need a referendum, just like Ireland with the Lisbon treaty.\" </p> <h2>7. Family: Which of the following statements most reflects your view:<br>(a) The tax system should be reformed to recognise and promote marriage<br>(b) The tax system should help parents regardless of their marital status </h2> <p>\"Well, we need to look at how people are managing their commitments, so that we can find a way of both helping families and making sure couples are not penalised for doing what they think is the right thing. At the moment, couples are being penalised for wanting to bring up children. We're offering a system where that choice will be supported by equity \u2013 in other words, tax that enables choice.\" </p> <h2>8. Abortion: The House of Commons recently voted to maintain the upper limit of 24 weeks on abortion. Do you believe it should be reduced? If yes, by how many weeks? </h2> <p>\"I'm involved in a medical charity and favour a reduction in abortion laws. The evidence that I have seen is compelling to reduce 24 weeks. How far I would pull that back \u2013 it's between 19-22 weeks \u2013 would probably be measured by the weight of the argument that's presented.\" </p> <p><strong>Interview by Johnny McDevitt</strong></p>",

Finally I was someone in my own right, who could hold her head up in the company of minor soap stars and other nonentities whose careers had hit the skids. </p> <p>Later, as I was treating myself to a glass of bubbly at the three-star luxury Queensland resort, my mobile rang. It was Mummy.

  "<p>I suspect that John Howard, whose name the Howard League takes, would have had something cautionary to say about the proposal to hand over local jails to local authorities, or rather to hand them back (Report, September 5). The effect of the 1877 Prisons Act was to bring all penal establishments under central control and to close a number of small town jails, so that there was some degree of uniformity of practice.</p> <p>The desire to address both retributive attitudes and the rush to titan prisons is wholly to be welcomed, but the interim report of the Commission on English Prisons Today may well have the opposite effect. Whatever performance standards are set by central government, local authorities will find their own ways of interpreting and implementing them. Contracting out to private operators would be one way of placating the \"lock 'em up and throw away the key\" correspondents in populist local newspapers under the guise of local accountability.</p> <p>Even so-called local prisons are not always very local. Some serve as many as six local government areas, making equitable financial arrangements complex and potentially contentious. The problem is magnified several times with regard to training prisons and to women's prisons. </p> <p>So, far from offering an \"exciting opportunity\", the proposal as reported offers a predictable and depressing prospect of small-town attitudes, further reduced budgets and the further commercialisation of imprisonment. To quote one initiative from the US is to ignore the reality of many town jails and state penitentiaries. My own (admittedly limited) experience was that conditions were best in those establishments run by the US Federal Bureau of Prisons.</p> <p>There is certainly a need for local rehabilitation units and groups who will support ex-prisoners in practical ways. There is far more to be done in raising the public profile of community sentences and in extending restorative justice initiatives.<br><strong>Peter Phillips</strong><br>Bristol</p>",
  "<p>In the sparse Yorkshire office of Stuart Andrew there is a poster above his desk announcing Friday is Casual Sex Day. Andrew, the Conservative candidate for Pudsey, once defected to Labour on account of Conservative homophobia but has since felt able to return. He's the son of a single mother, raised on a council estate, and the successful head of fundraising for a children's hospice. Andrew wants any tax cuts to be targeted at the poor first.</p> <p>It may only be slightly at odds with his mother's battles - a tricky divorce leaving her alone to bring up four boys - but Andrew thinks marriage should be recognised in the tax system and believes men should not adopt children. \"I always think of how the kid will be bullied at school.\"</p> <p>As for abortion, he would like to see a change because he has experience of the high quality of life severely ill children have, \"and working with children who have life-limiting illnesses also means I'd like to see a reduction in the upper limit of abortion\". Andrew calls himself a progressive and would cite his concern for the poorest in society, but is back to the future on family life - he's a progressive Conservative. </p> <p>Andrew was one of 66 Conservative candidates in winnable seats to take part in a survey conducted by the Guardian. His views are much in tune with many other candidates. All those polled regard themselves as \"progressive\", though many recast the term in thoroughly conservative language, as if still wrestling with David Cameron's depiction of the Tories as the \"true champions for progressive ideals\" in Britain.</p> <p>Those questioned favoured a reduction on the upper limit on abortion - 83% back any reduction, 61% a reduction to at least 22 weeks - with a handful wanting it banned. </p> <p>Of those who could be drawn on tax cuts, 44% think low tax is desirable but not until the end of the first parliament. Ten took the opportunity to say that the first tax cuts should be for the poorest in society. And despite being a Conservative and in principle wanting lower taxes, 68% of the progressive Conservative cohort supports its party's ambition to increase green taxes. The last surprise: a majority - 80% - think the UK has gained from being in Europe. They are Tory but they are new Tories too. </p> <p>The Guardian's team contacted candidates selected for the 200 most winnable seats to try and tease out the views of the likely new intake. </p> <p>While not all of them will make it to Westminster, many of them will. Nobody expects the Tories to have fewer seats after the next election than the 198 they won at the 2005 general election. But they will need to gain 126 seats to secure the 324 seats needed for a workable majority. Four candidates refused to take part in the survey: one because he said he had been told not to by Conservative Campaign Headquarters (CCHQ) and one because he did not want to speak to the Guardian. A briefing note was sent by CCHQ to some candidates reminding them of party policy in the areas covered by the survey. One respondent acknowledged that. Others said they had had no contact with CCHQ at all. In all, 66 candidates participated, interviewed by phone, email or face to face. Their replies are published in full online at theguardian.com/newtories.</p> <p>On tax breaks for marriage, a key Cameron policy, the candidates line up behind their leader, 84% of respondents saying the statement \"the tax system needs to be reformed to recognise and promote marriage\" was closer to their view than \"the tax system should help parents regardless of their marital status\".</p> <p>In Bolton North West Deborah Dunleavy, who is unmarried and raising children with her partner, underlined that she regarded the move to be fiscal rebalancing rather than cultural conservatism. \"It's not about giving married couples extra benefits,\" she said. \"But at the moment they are being penalised under the current government. Civil partnerships should be treated equally too.\" </p> <p>Shaun Bailey in Hammersmith said that right now \"to be married is almost a stigma\". Another PPC, Richard Graham (Gloucester), directly framed his answer in terms of being a progressive or not. </p> <p>\"I am with David Cameron on this,\" he said. \"My wife has three sisters who are divorced ... my wife and I have been happy together and we think marriage is the right thing. It doesn't sound progressive but by God it is.\" He did not explain how \u00a320 a week would have saved the marriages of his sisters-in-law.</p> <p>A majority of the candidates supported Cameron on tax breaks for married couples. But while some regarded the policy as a tax tidy-up, with an important social message, some candidates gave answers with a whiff of cultural conservativism.</p> <p>\"Would you prefer to be a single mum with a series of failed relationships with males, in preference to having a stable settled relationship with one man for the rest of your life? We seem to be championing the fact that it's all right to be accepting the second best route at the moment,\" said Philip Milton, Devon North.</p> <p>Jeremy Moulton, candidate for Southampton Test, also raised the spectre of the term \"single mothers\", a group the Conservatives have been at pains not to alienate since their past image as the \"nasty party\" was in no small part down to an apparent belief that single mothers were feckless. </p> <p>Moulton said: \"There are huge problems coming from single-parent families. Promoting marriage, which offers an extra \u00a31,000 per household, per year: a lot of people would go in for that in my constituency.\" </p> <p>But the other strain that was interesting might be a liberalising influence on Cameron when he implements this policy.</p> <p>A third of respondents took the opportunity, unprompted, to say that they would like those in any stable relationship, but not necessarily married, to also be recognised. George Osborne, the shadow chancellor, told the Guardian yesterday that a Tory government would aim to help all parents. He supported tax breaks for married couples and denied reports that he had fallen out with Cameron on the issue.</p> <p>\"I do think that parents raising children should be treated equally alongside those that are married,\" said Guto Bebb, candidate for Aberconwy. \"I don't think being married should be the only option. Clearly we have moved on since the 1950s.\" </p> <p>Ken Andrew, candidate for Carshalton and Wallington, made the point that those who had lost their spouse should not be penalised. Stuart Penketh (Ellesmere Port and Neston) said: \"It shouldn't be the government's responsibility to dictate to people how they live their lives, so long as it is legal ... I was brought up by my mother. She and my father divorced but he was always there.\"</p> <p>Another striking facet of the survey was the degree to which respondents lined up in support of green taxes. Cameron's enthusiasm for the environment is not shared universally by a party often allergic to tax increases. Sixty-six per cent of the candidates told the Guardian they supported the party on green taxes as long as Osborne stands by his commitment that they will not increase the overall tax burden. But 32% were unconvinced by the taxes, which are designed to curb pollution, and some candidates said they would hit the poor.</p> <p>There was confusion about what other tax cuts these green taxes might allow. Osborne has said that green taxes will pay for a \"family fund\" that will finance tax breaks for families. Guto Bebb called for green taxes instead of \"work tax\"; Trevor Ivory (North Norfolk) wanted to \"shift the tax burden away from jobs\". Other green ideas were raised instead of tax. Keith Girling in Bassetlaw thought that constituents who were environmentally friendly should be reimbursed. But then there were those with reservations. </p> <p>In Colne Valley, candidate Jason McCartney - in favour of the principle - admitted to the Guardian in a separate interview that at his selection meeting the issue he found most demanding was local hostility to a tax on so-called Chelsea tractors or 4x4s. \"The association were saying to me, 'Yes, they may be unnecessary for people down in the south but we want recognition that we need them up here'.\"</p> <p>Gordon Henderson, attempting to become MP for the Kent seat of Sittingbourne and Sheppey, made the local evening news recently by suggesting street rubbish could be cleared by the area's unoccupied elderly: \"I like to think of it as an environmental Grandad's Army.\" But he was opposed to the location in his area of the substation for the largest British wind farm. </p> <p>Suzy Davies, candidate for Brecon and Radnorshire, put wind farms, or what she called \"wind factories\", as the issue over which she would be prepared to defy prime minister Cameron. </p> <p>All respondents still held low tax to be a Conservative principle, but all kept to the party line that they could wait. </p> <p>\"Everybody has got their knickers in a twist about tax cuts,\" said Anna Sourby, candidate for Broxtowe. Mark Formosa, candidate for Taunton Deane, offered that \"kitting out our servicemen and women should come before any tax cuts\". Some were a little too transparently loyal - \"you couldn't get a cigarette paper between me and the party line on tax\" (Amber Rudd in Hastings and Rye), or principled: \"10 years ago I wouldn't have voted Tory myself, that is what is so progressive about this party - letting people on low incomes keep more of their earnings\" (Chris Philp in Hampstead and Kilburn). </p> <p>Flick Drummond (Portsmouth South) said he thought rightwinger John Redwood's policy review had been very good. In Birmingham Edgbaston, Birmingham city councillor Deirdre Alden said: \"We need to help hard-working families and couples without children\" and refused to go any further. Outside Alden's window was her husband's car, a silver Jaguar with the registration B17 TAX.</p> <p>If the party was once very publicly divided on the question of the European Union, this new generation is politeness itself, with a majority saying they believe the country has gained from membership.</p> <p>But should certain PPCs get to parliament, there will be moves to renegotiate our relationship with the EU, and those may be led by Jeremy Brier. On paper he's a Tory boy from central casting - one-time president of the Cambridge Union, now a 28-year-old barrister aiming to represent Luton. He is also the son of two social workers. A pet hobby of his is European law. \"When I tell my students that you can get member states voting no, for entirely different reasons - socialists in France and free marketeers in Holland, they laugh - it's madness.\" </p> <p>Most of Brier's colleagues had a two-part answer: on matters such as the environment, health and free trade, Britain had gained from being in the EU, but on the bureaucracy and fisheries policy, the EU left something to be desired. </p> <p>Mark Spencer, candidate for Sherwood, said: \"As a farmer, Europe is one of those areas where your working life and politics are hard to reconcile. As a farmer I'm protected by CAP, it's a source of our livelihood.\" Very few broached the idea of withdrawal from the EU, or as Chris Walker, candidate for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirkshire, put it, \"retreat ... the million-dollar question\". </p> <p>The language used by the candidates is occasionally antiquated: public finances are a \"shambles\"; we should \"salute\" civil partnerships, but on policy there has been movement. Their leadership calls it \"progressive goals through Conservative means\" but this survey of the likely next group of Tory MPs shows it may be more like a conjoining of cultural conservatism on private life with strong backing for the leadership on tax, with the hope that cuts will be targeted at the poor.</p> <p>You wouldn't get George Osborne driving a Jaguar with a car registration plate ending in TAX, you wouldn't get policy chief Oliver Letwin with a poster about casual sex above his desk and you wouldn't get shadow work and pensions secretary Chris Grayling suggesting pensioners clean the streets. But with the new intake of MPs the signs are that they'll mix things up a bit.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/series/newtories\">Read all the candidates' answers</a></p>",
  "<p>A woman convinced that she emits an unpleasant smell is persuaded to travel around on public transport with a portion of fish and chips to monitor how people react to her. This will allow her to assess the \"evidence\": she will realise that there is a difference between times when she is the bearer of a strong smell and when she is not, and this will help her to \"correct\" her beliefs.</p> <p>Welcome to the world of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), which has enjoyed a massive expansion over the past 10 years, not only in Britain but in much of the west. Where once a diversity of therapies flourished, today CBT is progressively replacing the older treatments. It's cheap, it shows results on paper and it chimes with a commonsense, problem-solving view of the world. </p> <p>Developed by the American psychiatrist Aaron Beck in the 1960s, CBT was based on the idea that our emotions and moods were influenced by our patterns of thinking. The aim of therapy was to \"correct\" these processes, \"to think and act more realistically\". It would allow the patient to avoid the misconstruction of reality that had led to their problems.</p> <p>Rather than focus on the patient's history - say their childhood and early experiences - like most other psychotherapies, CBT is mostly directed to the here and now. Patient and therapist agree on targets and formulate ways to achieve these in each session. Patterns of negative thinking are pinpointed and alternatives discussed. Homework is set at the end of each session, which might include self-monitoring, record-keeping and other tools of self-inspection. </p> <p>After her strange sojourn on the tube, the woman with the fish and chips would meet her therapist and discuss the events of the day. If she realised that people in fact reacted to her less when she didn't have the malodorous meal, then she might be able to change her thought pattern, to see her life in a more positive way. She would learn that her symptom was an incorrect interpretation of reality and hopefully come to see the world as everyone else does.</p> <p>But why did she suffer from this olfactory symptom in the first place? What function did it have in her life? If she was certain about it, what role did certainty play for her? Could it have been a solution to some other, less obvious problem? And if so, what would be the consequences of trying to remove it? </p> <p>Most therapies aim to hear what is being expressed in a symptom: not to stifle it, but to give it a voice and to see what function it has for the individual. CBT, by contrast, aims to remove symptoms. </p> <p>The popularity of CBT with government agencies is no surprise. This year has seen the launch of Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT), an initiative to train a \"workforce\" of mostly cognitive therapists to cure the nation's anxious and depressed inhabitants. Lord Layard, the so-called happiness tsar and one of the architects of this new project, is delighted. At last, everyone will have access to proven treatments that have the right scientific credentials. And we will save a lot of money into the bargain. Depression and anxiety cost the economy around \u00a312bn a year - 1% of the total national income - yet the new therapies will be able to cure people for only \u00a3750 a head. The saving on drugs bills and incapacity benefits is staggering. </p> <p>But what might the real costs of this initiative be? And what does the rise of CBT tell us about the world we live in today? The government also plans to regulate mediums and spiritualists. It will no longer be up to us to believe in them or not, but a higher power will tell us who is legitimate and who is not. Just as a new rhetoric of \"science\" tells us that CBT is the best treatment, so it will arbitrate the \"other side\" - and all government has to do is back up science with legislation.</p> <p>These are extraordinary developments in our times. And they highlight a strange paradox of the modern self. We are told that we are responsible for our own lives, that we have the power to transform ourselves. Yet at the same time we are treated as minors who lack the faculty of critical judgment and must be protected against unscrupulous and dangerous predators. </p> <p>Today it is plasticity and change that govern our self-image. Personality itself is represented as a set of skills that we can learn and modify. Just as we can alter our bodies through cosmetic surgery, so we can change our behaviour through \"work\" on ourselves. Reality TV displays princes who become paupers, children who swap parents and geeks who become Don Juans. The possibilities of transformation seem endless. Thatcher's dream of social mobility has become not just nightly entertainment, but also individual imperative. </p> <p>CBT promises change just as swiftly. Unwanted character traits or symptoms are no longer seen as a clue to some inner truth, but simply as disturbances to our ideal image that can be excised. Instead of seeing a bout of depression or an anxiety attack as a sign of unconscious processes that need to be carefully elicited and voiced, they become aspects of behaviour to be removed. </p> <p>The market has triumphed here, as our inner worlds become a space for buying and selling. We pay experts such as life coaches to teach us how to change in the desired way. Aspects of ourselves, such as shyness or confidence, become commodities that we can pay to lose or amplify. Depression or anxiety are seen as isolated problems that can be locally targeted without calling into question the rest of one's existence, in the same way that a missile attack on a terrorist installation is supposed to get rid of the problem posed by terrorism. </p> <p>This is a modern self for which depth has become surface. In soaps and reality shows characters share their innermost feelings and emotions, as if there were a perfect continuity between interior and exterior life. If there's any ambiguity, a panel of experts is there, as on Big Brother, to explain people's motivations. The self is no longer a dark cave; everything is laid bare. In effect, we have been robbed of our interior lives. </p> <p>Many social theorists have seen this atomisation as a consequence of market-led economies. As the market governs all, it was only a matter of time before basic human attributes would come to be taken as commodities and relationships as transactions. Students became clients of educational services, children clients of their parents. And it was no surprise that the view of human beings as subjects competing in the marketplace for goods and services would need a psychology to underpin it. </p> <p>This new psychology broke radically from traditional ideas. The self had once been understood as a place of conflict: between reason and passion, between the will and understanding, between repressed desires and their inhibition. But, as Nikolas Rose observed in his study Governing the Soul, the self is now no longer intrinsically fractured, it just needs to \"actualise\" itself. </p> <p>The divided self dear to the 60s has vanished, along with the recognition that grief, despair and frustration strike at the heart of our image of self-possession and fulfilment. The psyche has become like a muscle that needs to be developed and trained. There is no place for complexity and contradiction here: the modern subject is represented as one-dimensional, searching for fulfilment. The possibility that human life is aimed at both success and failure and never simply at wealth, power or happiness no longer makes sense. Suddenly the world of human relations described by novelists, poets and playwrights for the past few centuries can just be written off. Self-sabotage, masochism and despair are now faults to be corrected, rather than forming the very core of the self.</p> <p>The new psychology is thus in the service of the market. Symptoms become understood as deviations, pieces of learned conduct that can be undone by short courses in re-education. This is the soil in which CBT came to flourish. Its textbooks refer unashamedly to \"belief modification\" and to \"selling the treatment\" to the patient. It follows a market-led vision of the psyche in which a symptom, for example depression or insomnia, is not seen as a general problem in a person's existence - which, if unravelled, might lead to the unravelling of the self - but as a local disturbance that can be managed and put right. </p> <p>This commodification of the psyche is reflected in the change in mental health diagnoses. In the early 20th century, there were between a dozen and two dozen discrete diagnostic categories - breaking down different aspects of mental health. By the early 90s there were more than 360. Easily observable surface symptoms, such as shyness, have been taken to define disorders. Many of these have been developed and advertised by drug companies in order to carve out market niches for new drugs. Social phobia, for example, was sold as a diagnosis by the makers of a drug - moclobemide - that claimed to cure it. </p> <p>The new focus on surface behaviour makes cognitive-style therapies seem more scientific. As Ian Parker, professor of psychology at Manchester Metropolitan University, observes, if a disorder is defined by symptoms, get rid of the symptoms and you've got rid of the disorder. The therapist carries out a more or less mechanical procedure, a series of protocols formulated in advance, which have been approved by management and checked by inspectorate. On paper it looks good: symptoms appear reduced. But there is no tracking of so-called \"alternative symptoms\", the problems that will emerge in mind or body when the original symptom is removed. A woman troubled by a dog phobia may be able to overcome this with a behavioural treatment, but what of her relationship with her father, a concentration camp survivor who became terrified of German shepherds after the war? If her symptom articulated a certain identification with his anxiety, how would this find expression once she was deprived of the phobia?</p> <p>These important complexities have little place in a society where depth has become surface. What matters are quick-fix cosmetic solutions, rubber-stamped by so-called experts. Where articles and books once used to develop concepts and ideas, today the expression \"Research shows ...\" encourages us to stop thinking. Not long ago the media excitedly carried the \"news\" that research had shown that depressed fathers had an effect on the wellbeing of their children. Well, who would seriously have thought otherwise? Was it really necessary to have a government grant to show this? And in fact, the methodology in most of these studies is deeply flawed.</p> <p>This is a world in which nothing counts as knowledge unless it is sanctioned by experts. Advice on baby-rearing or nutrition may seem sensible, but can there really be a correct way to conduct a relationship, to fall in love or to maintain beliefs? Knowledge has become almost synonymous with a product: any new idea or discovery has to demonstrate how it can be practically put to use - which means sold. Researchers have to specify the \"outcomes\" they seek and how these will be beneficial. Even a public sculpture project has to explain what use each detail will have.</p> <p>In today's outcome-obsessed society, people must become countable, quantifiable, transparent. And this leads to a grotesque new misunderstanding of psychotherapy. Therapy is now conceived as a set of techniques that can be applied to a human being. This makes sense if we see it as a business transaction with a buyer, a seller and a product. But it totally ignores the most basic fact: that therapy is not like a plaster that can be applied to a wound, but is a property of a human relationship. Therapy is about the encounter of two people, and the real work is done not by the therapist but by the patient. As the psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott observed, the therapist provides a space in which the patient can construct and create something. The therapist encourages and facilitates, but whether a therapy takes place or not depends entirely on the patient.</p> <p>Unlike CBT, traditional therapies do not aim to give access to a common, scientific reality but to take the patient's own reality seriously: to explore it, to define it, to elaborate it and to see where it will go. No outcome can be predicted in advance: the patient may go back to work but equally they may give up a well-paid job to pursue another path. </p> <p>Therapies such as CBT, which claim to deliver a product, can certainly be helpful for some people. But it is crucial to distinguish the question of whether a therapy works and how it works. For any therapy to get started, unconscious belief systems need to be mobilised. Human belief is a very powerful thing and no external authority can tell us what to believe in, although the persecution of religion groups shows that this is hardly self-evident.</p> <p>Lord Layard stunned therapists earlier this year with the following vignette: \"The most striking experience I've had in the last few years was when the chief executive of a mental health trust ... said his life had been saved by CBT ... He said he is a fully fledged bipolar case but he has not had a day off work for the last 15 years. He has a little book, which he carries around and whenever he has funny thoughts coming into his mind, he turns to the relevant page, according to what kind of thought it is or if he has a mood attack, and he does exactly what it says on the page. Now, you could say that's mechanical. I say that it's brilliant and not so different, you know, from what Jesus or any other great healer did for people.\"</p> <p>Mao would perhaps have liked this story, and hoped that the little book was his own. And indeed, cognitive therapy was perhaps used most widely in the Cultural Revolution in China, where people were taught that depression was just wrong thinking. Separated from their families, unable to contact loved ones, subject to cruel punishments and witness to the murder or \"vanishing\" of those closest to them, millions of people were \"taught\" to devalue their reactions. The world should be thought about in a different way, and happiness and enthusiasm replace despair and despondency. Positive thinking should banish unhelpful negative attitudes. </p> <p>This denial of the legitimacy of people's symptoms may have dangerous consequences. Diverting psychological processes from proper working through can result in both new symptoms and acts of violence. CBT's effort to ignore the effects of an individual's history in favour of a shallow analysis of the here and now sets a bleak example to those who believe that if the 20th century had any lesson, it was precisely not to deny the significance of human history and memory.</p> <p><strong> \u00b7 </strong>Darian Leader's latest book <strong>The New Black: Mourning, Melancholia and Depression</strong>, is published by Hamish Hamilton</p>",
  "<h2>Teaching faux pas</h2> <p>I'm really disappointed at the almost uncritical push for Michel Thomas's language teaching methods. I've listened to several of the CDs - in French, German and Spanish - and I found that after a considerable investment of time, I had no understanding of the structure of the language. The nature of the method means that, even after many hours of application, one has not seen or written a single word - it is based on sounds only: difficult when one is trying to grasp verbs and nouns. Thomas sounded quite irritable with some of the students when they made mistakes and for me that was off-putting to the extent I could not carry on. Some objective assessment of the long-term benefits of this method would be interesting.<br><strong>Norma Laming</strong>, London W11 </p> <h2>Database dangers</h2> <p>We welcome the government's decision to postpone ContactPoint, the child protection database, until it is robust (Why the delay in launching database? September 2). But we fear that no amount of tinkering will make it secure. The government's own review, commissioned from Deloitte last year, identified security failings, pointed to significant risks to the database caused by lack of expertise and resource, noted the limits on the ContactPoint team's ability to monitor breaches or control breakdowns, and hinted that the true cost of fixing these bugs could be excessive.</p> <p>But is a cost-benefit analysis the right approach when it relates to the security of information about every child in England? The reality is that all databases are liable to security lapses. The only effective way to safeguard our children's data is to scrap the ContactPoint system.<br><strong>Matthew Burgess </strong>, Independent Schools Council, London WC2</p> <p>Your investigation into ContactPoint is a reminder that, at \u00a3224m, it is a colossal overreaction to the mistakes in the Victoria Climbie case and will probably make another child death more, not less, likely. Recent evidence demonstrates how permeable government computer systems and data storage are. The fact that MPs voted to have their own children excluded from the database tells us something about its perceived security. </p> <p>Child protection will always require better communication between agencies, but it will not be delivered by artificial means. It happens when staff from different agencies train and work together using common procedures. Relying on a computer to identify risk or improve communication is dangerous, and is no substitute for professional judgment.<br><strong>Steven Walker</strong>, Anglia Ruskin University, Chelmsford, Essex </p> <h2>No contract</h2> <p>Peter Mortimore wrongly claims that the Specialist Schools and Academies Trust has been subcontracted to support schools that do not meet the government's 30% benchmark for five good GCSEs (Closure plans reveal low-grade thinking, September 2). SSAT has over 90% of English secondary schools in membership, and this includes the fifth of schools in the National Challenge.

Compare that with the experience of my son in a state school. On applying to Cambridge, he had to sit the exam paper in the back of a normal noisy class at school.

  "<p>There weren't many things to feel cheerful about, arriving back in England after a month abroad. The sunless skies matched by the same old political arguments. One small light on the horizon was Accord, the new coalition campaigning to end the restrictive admissions and employment practices allowed in faith schools. The timing is perfect, in the middle of proposed changes to the admissions code that could be a backwards step in the slow march towards eradicating social selection in schools.</p> <p>It is mind-boggling that so little attention has been paid to this until now. Discrimination on the grounds of faith, race, gender, sexual orientation and disability is outlawed under UK and European human rights law. </p> <p>There would be an outcry if any school overtly refused entry to a black child, or turned down an Asian teacher on the grounds of race, yet schools can routinely refuse entry to children on the grounds of their religious adherence, or lack of it, because faith schools are exempt from the equalities legislation.</p> <p>In a recent radio debate on this subject, the Catholic writer Cristina Odone, now championing the cause of faith schools, suggested that this form of discrimination remains vital to allow faith schools to continue their role as protectors of minority groups.</p> <p>Presumably she includes middle-class parents in this category, since it is only two years since she made a rather different and much less altruistic argument in a newspaper article, headlined \"Labour's dirty little educational secret\", which urged the government to \"stop punishing the middle-class parents' guilty ambition to leave the dross behind\" and ensure their children could be educated with \"people like us\", even if for some it meant \"rigging the system\" by claiming religious observance.</p> <p>Scratch below the surface of so many people's high ideals about faith schools and you often find the same old low motives. Not all faith schools practice social selection, but research presented to the Children, Schools and Families select committee early this year showed that many start out with higher-ability children and fewer children on free school meals than their surrounding communities. </p> <p>In some areas, the number of children on free school meals is up to 50% higher than it is in the local faith school, and that can be partly attributed to the ingenious ways they choose their pupils, often using convoluted banding and criteria that would test the mettle of even the most determined parent. </p> <p>The suspicion that some faith schools abuse their freedoms tars the entire sector, as some religious leaders now recognise. It could easily be dispelled if admissions criteria based on faith were prohibited, giving all parents and pupils, regardless of their social, cultural or religious heritage, the right to choose schools rather than schools choosing them.</p> <p>However, the government, which has taken significant steps towards making the system fairer by outlawing the use of interviews, subjective questionnaires and primary headteacher references, now appears to be having a collective attack of the vapours following the response to its condemnation of religious schools that ask for financial contributions as conditions of entry. The new draft admissions code (consultation ends on October 2: <a href=\"http://www.dcsf.gov.uk/sacode\">dcsf.gov.uk/sacode</a>) proposes that even though the same schools should be banned from asking for money, they should be allowed to prioritise parents who support their statement of ethos.</p> <p>Given that most parents who want a place at a school would presumably be happy to tick the ethos box whatever they believe, schools would then be left to their own devices to decide which families would support that ethos most effectively. </p> <p>How would they do that? We can but guess, but postcodes can tell a story, and the chances are that if this survives the consultation it will only provide more opportunities to pick the \"people like us\" and leave the rest behind.</p>",
  "<p>Going on a school trip can be a life-changing event, bringing memories that stay forever. For many children it might be the first time they have slept away from home overnight. Even just a day trip to a museum can sew the seeds of a life-long love affair with culture. </p> <p>For headteacher Brian Thomas, accompanying his brother-in-law on a school trip to Dorset was the catalyst which triggered a 34-year career in teaching. He remembers: \"I was a senior manager for Godfrey Davies and it was 1969. The children were living out and had to make their own shelter. I realised what children gained from the experience, from the residential aspect and the environmental studies - it was what made me want to be a teacher.\"</p> <p>Thomas' enthusiasm for school trips has stayed with him ever since. His 418-pupil Milton Mount primary school in Crawley, West Sussex was one of the first, 18 months ago, to sign up to the government's Learning Outside the Classroom manifesto which acknowledges that children's education can be enriched the other side of the school gates. So far around 1,000 schools and education organisations have pledged their support. The government's next step comes in October when it launches a \"quality badge\" or kite-mark system for popular UK school trip destinations in a bid to take some of the bureaucracy out of the organisation, making it easier for schools while, at the same time, reassuring parents that the venues have an educational value and have met safety guidelines.</p> <p><strong>Safety issues</strong></p> <p>Children's safety underpins any school trip, be it a visit to the local museum or a trek through the South American rainforest. When things go wrong the tragedies dominate news headlines, making every parent think \"what if\" and teachers re-check their risk assessment. While any accidental death on a school trip will always be one too many, the official statistics are reassuring, showing that a child is more likely to die following an accident at home or on the road in the UK than they are on a school trip. </p> <p>According to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA), in the last 22 years 60 children and 10 adults from the UK have died on a school trip at home or abroad, the most common causes being drowning or a road accident. This compares with the 121 children last year in Great Britain, who died following a road accident and 93, the previous year, who suffered a fatal accident at home.</p> <p>Peter Cornall, head of leisure safety at RoSPA, says: \"If you consider there are around 7m school trips every year we are talking about a very small number that go wrong. What a school trip can do is give children an opportunity to start thinking about dangers and risk assessment. It gives them the opportunity to trust adults other than their parents, in the real world.\" </p> <p>Margaret Morrissey from the National Confederation of Parent Teacher Associations recognises parents' concerns about safety but says the benefits far outweigh the risks: \"The value of these trips is tremendous. It builds children's confidence and does something parents can't do which is to take them away from their parents and teach them to be more independent.\" </p> <p>Personal memories from school trips can stay forever. Brian Thomas, who retired from teaching at the end of the summer term, recalls meeting a former pupil, now in her 40s, at a recent reunion party: \"She told me that the residential visits we went on 26 years ago had had an impact on her for the rest of her life.\" </p> <p>Marcus Bailie is head of inspections at the Adventure Activities Licensing Authority - the organisation which endorses the way that centres are managed - set up in the wake of the Lyme Regis canoeing disaster in 1993 which claimed the lives of four teenage pupils. He attributes a two-week school out-door activities trip to France after A-levels as an event which changed his life, developing an interest in kayaking which has stayed with him ever since.</p> <p>Tina Corri, head of education at English Heritage, is responsible for the learning experiences on offer at its 415 sites. They range from castles and stately homes to stone circles and Stonehenge, which are visited by more than 400,000 children and adults on educational trips each year. She says: \"Just being in a different learning environment, out in the fresh air, standing on a castle wall - learning about the real things in the place, in their true context - can be a real experience. I remember when I was 12 or 13 going on a school trip to the National Gallery, it was a really formative time.

  "<p>There's a message on the answering machine from Daughter's hairdresser. Which of her appointments does she wish to keep? Hairdresser is so important to Daughter that she often books multiple appointments to make dead sure of getting one, and this time, while she's considering her options, she can't help but notice my hair. It isn't good enough. It's me she's thinking of. She's taking over my mother's role. She just wants me to make the best of myself, and I'm not doing so. </p> <p>\"You should go to my hairdresser,\" says Daughter, bossily. \"Mine is the best. She's better than yours and she's cheaper. And why does yours bleach your highlights first? She's not meant to do that. She should be doing lowlights. Highlights for fair hair, lowlights for dark. Shall I book you in to mine?'</p> <p>No thank you. I explain why. Because I love my hairdresser. She is the only hairdresser who can make me look like a normal adult with a proper hairstyle. I owe her. Until Elaine arrived, I had had a bad-hair life, because I have a tiny skull with thin and clinging hair on top of a big, tall body with a long nose. And hair is pivotal - it holds the reins. One fleeting chance reflection in a shop window, showing the hair from the side, and your confidence is shot, your day ruined.</p> <p>No wonder it upset my mother. My girl cousins all had hairstyles and married successfully. I did not. I blame the hair. It caused my stoop and gave out the wrong message. You cannot throw your chest out boldly if your head looks silly. Then Elaine came along and made me look like Sharon Osbourne (before she went blonde), which is how I wanted to look. And sometimes the look lasted for up to three whole days. </p> <p>But Daughter isn't listening. She's got through to her hairdresser and is describing my hair. \"It's grey and rather stringy,\" says she pitilessly, \"and sort of flat and ratty at the ends.\" Then, with tremendous scorn: \"She wants to look like Sharon Osbourne.\" She and her hairdresser share a disdainful little laugh. But they know something must be done. \"I'll try and drag her along,\" says Daughter wearily, aware of the burdensome but vital task ahead of her, like getting an addict into rehab. </p> <p>But I won't go. No, no, no. Because, for me, the hairdresser's salon is purgatory: the waiting, the grisly background music, the boredom, the pin-headed, moonfaced creature in the mirror, the humiliation, while all around, other women swan about looking fabulous, even with their hair soaked and scraped back. Daughter is one of those. So I don't go to hairdressers, ever. Elaine kindly comes here, so I can go through the ordeal in secret. </p> <p>Luckily I have a temporary reprieve. From the hair. Because I have more things that Daughter thinks desperately in need an upgrade or removal: my sofa, car, decor, shelving, wardrobe, brassieres, whiskers ... Is it sons as well? Or is it just daughters? </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Dr Quatermass's experiment is really happening. Who remembers that from 1953 and saw it on telly? Did you think it was make-believe? Did you think no real scientist would be dozy enough to risk anything quite so dangerous - a sort of rapidly growing, all-enveloping plant-like alien organism that threatened to swallow up life as we knew it? No. You thought it was science fiction - a mad scientist sends the first human into space and back comes a pulsating giant plant with killer spores. That's the risk you take when you go barging into the unknown.</p> <p>Tomorrow, the mad scientists of the Cern (European Organisation for Nuclear Research) project are doing it for real, blundering into the unknown, same as Quatermass, only down instead of up, in a tunnel hundreds of feet below Geneva to \"fire up the Large Hadron Collider\", to bash sub-atomic particles together in an effort to find out why galaxies don't fly apart. And if it all goes wrong, we may get \"matter goo\", consuming the world from the inside and blotting us all out, or a mini-black hole sucking us all in. </p> <p>Why? I want to know why. Have they nothing better to do, nothing more practical to diddle about with - such as malaria cures or flood defences or nuclear waste disposal or how to make sunshine out of cucumbers or turn shit into gold? Why dig a whacking great hole underground and recreate what they think was the big bang? Why risk making more black holes, even if they are only teeny-weeny ones? Why play with the planet? And they're not the only ones. There's another lot at it in Fermilab near Chicago, and another in Cleveland UK at the Zeplin III project. This \u00a32m dark-matter underground laboratory has an \"outside chance\" of spotting \"occasional weakly interactive massive particle (Wimp) interactions\". </p> <p>You can almost hear the clashing of antlers. Ours is bigger than yours. Ours will be first. Size doesn't matter. Rival blokes doing extreme science. And while they've been messing about getting ready to possibly suck us all to hell, nobody has taken much notice, because science has its own rather odd vocabulary that is difficult to decipher. Hardly anyone can be arsed to sweat through it, rather like the national curriculum. It's such obscure gibberish that you tend to glaze over, forget all about it, and then, while you weren't looking, something deeply horrible has crept up and happened. </p> <p>So I forced Rosemary to sit down and read about Cern properly. \"We needn't worry yet,\" said she. \"We've got four years. Then \"a pinprick of light [may] come out of the Indian Ocean, and a spinning quasar will destroy the world from within\".</p> <p>That's a relief.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>This week Michele read How (Not) To Murder Your Mother, by Stephanie Calman. \"Very funny and poignant in a rather ghastly way, as it often is with one's mother - but, best of all, her mother was more enraging than mine, and she was ruder to hers than I was. Which is quite something.\"</p>",
  "<p>America is a land that feels familiar, but often turns out to be very foreign: so much of what happens there is beyond European imagining. The spectacular rescue on Sunday of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is a case in point. These two strange, gargantuan financial bodies could not have been born in Britain and they could not have been saved in Britain. They carried in their DNA both the old idealism of FDR's New Deal (established in 1938, Fannie Mae was a government agency for its first 30 years) and a much more modern and toxic capacity to bring the world financial system to its knees. </p> <p>Without the US government's decision to take control - nationalisation in all but name - and to inject up to $100bn into each, the downturn could have slumped into depression. This rescue had to happen. But an American fix will not solve Britain's problems, and nor does it provide any longer-term solutions to the obvious and painful failings of capitalism. At great cost, American taxpayers have defused a bomb whose imminent detonation might have caused intercontinental financial ruin. But all that has been gained is time. The world still needs to work out what should happen next.</p> <p>Small, short-term rallies on stock markets yesterday (limited in London by a computer breakdown that suspended trading) cannot hide the fact that the last year has seen market failure on an extraordinary scale. Nor will the latest rescue prevent this failure continuing. Other American financial institutions with famous names are threatened, so big that they too would have to be rescued. Each Megabank that wobbles threatens to cause a mega-crash. But at least, for all its claim to love capitalism red in tooth and claw, America has a tradition of muscular financial interventionism on the part of the federal government, even if some of it has been unwound over the past decade. The rescue of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is simply much the biggest example. Britain has no such tradition, and this government has shown itself strangely reluctant to begin one. The Bank of England did not make vigorous use of the special liquidity scheme introduced at the start of the year; indeed it will be closed next month. </p> <p>Gordon Brown's lame claim yesterday that Britain can \"do well indeed ... [out] of a new world of new change\" is evidence of a prime minister who still chooses to think that economic woes have been imported and so, presumably, must be solved abroad. It would be more use if he, or someone else in government, began to address the reality of Britain's position. Arguably, it is worse than America's. The housing bubble was bigger, and the decline in prices is less well advanced. The British economy shows no sign of the recovery predicted for America - and which, if it happens, might leave taxpayers in pocket over time with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Employment figures here are still robust, but if they falter, and house prices fall, pressure on mortgage lenders will grow. That is what did for the two US giants - neither directly exposed to sub-prime. Their rescue may help make conditions more comfortable in America. In Britain, the pain is still to come. </p> <p>So many questions have been raised by the credit crunch that answering them all will take decades. The most obvious lesson is that the state still has a central role in protecting the vulnerable from risk. The biggest banks can only be bailed out by government. But there is no reason why public protection should enhance private profit: as true of Northern Rock here as it is of the striking $23m payoff for the bosses of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. Corporate excess needs to be regulated in all its forms - risk and reward - and that is another job for the state. In the meantime, though, the global financial system has been caught staggering, close to collapse. Propping it up is the right thing to do, if only to save citizens from the consequences of a failure that is not of their making, and to provide space for recovery and reform.</p>",
  "<p>Andy Murray insisted all along that New York was his kind of town and, even in defeat, who would have the nerve to doubt him now? The kid from Dunblane lost his first grand slam final last night within the pulsating confines of the Arthur Ashe stadium, succumbing to Roger Federer in three straight sets. That was the headline news, the sum total of an odyssey that has gripped a nation back home, but like any great narrative it was not as straightforward as that.</p> <p>Murray was beaten in a tennis match, sure, but over the past two weeks he won other battles: with himself and with those who have long dismissed him as a sullen, uncooperative man-child, unworthy of a nation's respect and support.</p> <p>Last night marked the end of his grand slam hopes for the year but it was also the death knell for the ridiculous caricatures and lazy cliches that have followed him thus far into his career. He is not \"Kevin the teenager\" or some ignorant, Scottish oik consumed with anti-English hatred. He is Andy Murray, brilliant tennis player and sportsman supreme.</p> <p>It was hardly his fault that Federer chose this moment to rediscover the form that made him all but unbeatable over 4\u00bd years. As every armchair amateur sports psychologist knows, you cannot control what your opponent does, only what you do yourself, and although Murray may have found fault with his tactics and his ground strokes, he could not find fault with the person he has become.</p> <p>In the face of the partisan hordes who crammed into the stadium hoping to see Federer win his fifth consecutive US Open, he was implacable. In the face of three outrageously bad line calls in the crucial second set, one of which cost him a service break, he was restrained. In the face of defeat, he was dignity itself.</p> <p>Wealth and success brings its own kind of tranquillity but no one who has followed Murray's career thus far, through its various and occasionally embarrassing manifestations of teenage angst, ever thought it would come to this, at least not this soon. Likewise, no one who has followed his rise through the world rankings expected to find him this close to the summit, this soon. The Scot, we now know, was working to a timetable of his own. That he reached yesterday's final was both a joyous surprise and the entirely predictable outcome of the personal transformation he himself has wrought.</p> <p>What carried him within one victory of a grand slam? The answer is as conclusive as his victory over Rafael Nadal had been the previous day or, to put it another way, as uplifting as spending a few minutes in the company of the world No1. \"He played better than me and he beat me,\" said the Spaniard, declining numerous invitations to blame a gruelling schedule for his defeat. \"He beat me because he was better than me.\"</p> <p>Nadal learned long ago that excuses are for losers, that energy is best expended in the cause of crushing opponents rather than raging against circumstance. Murray, it is now apparent, has graduated summa cum laude from the same school of maturity, as he himself acknowledged.</p> <p>\"I think when you go on the court and you haven't put in the work off it, you can find excuses for why you're not playing well or why you're getting tired and stuff,\" he said. \"I go on the court now without feeling like I have anything to worry about, because I've worked hard and practised hard and given myself the best opportunity to play well. All I've got to do is play tennis, which is one of the few things that I'm good at.\"</p> <p>If the Scot has found peace within himself, then it appears he has also come to an accommodation with those for whom he has reserved most contempt in the past, his tormentors in the media. \"When I first came on the scene at Wimbledon in 2005 I had done very few press conferences. Then all of a sudden I was the centre of attention at the biggest tennis tournament in the world. I'm not someone who liked sort of celebrity life. I like to just relax with my friends and family. So I had a few problems early on in my career, but I think I'm dealing with it much better now. I think you get used to it.\"</p> <p>He had better get used to it, for he has unleashed a storm with his glorious performances at Flushing Meadows. Henceforth his every move will be monitored, his every utterance dissected in the search for a greater headline.</p> <p>Such is the nature of the beast in these multimedia days, but as we prepare to gorge ourselves on all things Murray it is not too late to point that out that if he has come to understand the world confronting him, then the world must come to understand this complicated but compelling man.</p>",
  "<h2>1. Perception: Do you consider yourself to be a progressive?</h2> <p>\"I think that to a large extent the Conservative party has always been the progressive party back to Benjamin Disraeli who legalised trade unions and empowered local government. We are the progressive party now \u2014 you only have to look at 10 years of Labour to see that the inequality gap is growing. There are almost 4 million pupils who have left school without four good GCSEs including Maths and English. When you look at figures like that you wouldn't believe we have had 11 years of a Labour government. We are progressive in that we are the party of opportunity of social mobility and that increases social esteem. </p> <p>\"I work as a barrister in criminal law and the number of young people I see with absolutely zero self esteem, involved in the criminal justice system, drug addicts. David Cameron said Margaret Thatcher had to deal with a broken economy he has to deal with a broken society \u2013 I don't want to quibble with Boris Johnson or David but I am sure that it is right that there are some things that are broken in this society. Inequalities are the widest they have ever been and getting wider nobody would have believed that listening to New Labour in 1997. The poorest fifth of the population are paying the highest proportion of tax of any group.\"</p> <h2>2. Tax: Should David Cameron offer more tax cuts than he has outlined already? </h2> <p>\"We have already said we would abolish stamp duty for first time buyers and raise the inheritance tax threshold because it is unfair. We believe in lower taxes, doing this is economically more efficient but we can't make any uncosted promises at the moment.\"</p> <h2>3. Tax: If yes to the above, do you think they should be funded by <br>(a) cuts in public spending, or<br>(b) increases in other taxes</h2> <p>\"We really can't say what will happen in two years' time but we know that we can make savings from bureaucracy. A doctor told me there is one manager for every hospital bed. We will of course save billions by scrapping ID cards.\"</p> <h2>4. Tax: Should so-called \"green\" taxes increase? </h2> <p>\"We have said that we would increase the percentage of taxation raised through green taxes that means redirected taxation away from certain things like jobs and entrepreneurialism and into carbon emissions. George Osborne has said revenue raised through green taxes would be added to an independently monitored family fund aimed at tax cuts for families.\" </p> <h2>5. Tax: As a share of GDP tax is currently around 37%. After four years of a Conservative government would you expect it to be:<br>(a) substantially lower \u2013 at least 2 percentage points<br>(b) slightly lower<br>(c) much the same as it is now<br>(d) higher</h2> <p>\"You couldn't possibly expect anyone to make any predictions six years hence; even those far more enlightened than me are not doing that. We haven't seen the books yet.\"</p> <h2>6. Europe: On balance has Britain lost out or gained from its membership of the EU? If it has lost out, should it withdraw? </h2> <p>\"On balance we have gained and we should stay in so long as it is good for us and where it isn't we should start saying so. It's been extremely beneficial in terms of things like a say in global warming and global health but as Barack Obama said last night (August 28) you make progress from the bottom up not the top down and Europe is too full of messages and rules from the top.\"</p> <h2>7. Family: Which of the following statements most reflects your view:<br>(a) The tax system should be reformed to recognise and promote marriage<br>(b) The tax system should help parents regardless of their marital status </h2> <p>\"I am an A. The tax and benefit system should encourage families to stay together. I have been in criminal law for 15 years and all the time this issue rears its head. Why should the system subsidise single parents or couples to live apart when all the evidence shows families and children are better when couples are together.\"</p> <h2>8. Abortion: The House of Commons recently voted to maintain the upper limit of 24 weeks on abortion. Do you believe it should be reduced? If yes, by how many weeks? </h2> <p>\"I believe the limit should be lowered perhaps to 22 weeks because medical evidence shows that new advances mean that babies can be kept alive much earlier.\"</p> <p><strong>Interview by Mark Gould</strong></p>",
  "<h2>1. Perception: Do you consider yourself to be a progressive? </h2> <p>\"I think the party is progressive and I count myself among a new breed of Conservative candidates. I work in a state school, I'm young \u2013 perhaps not what you wouldn't typically expect.</p> <p>\"The problem with the party is that it is still trying to apply 80s solutions to modern-day problems, and that doesn't work. But I think there is a new group of Conservatives, and I think I am among them, that are coming up with new solutions, and things are changing. In the first year after [David] Cameron was elected as leader I think it was about changing the mood music, the colours, the language. It was very important to convince people that we understood what the issues are today. </p> <p>\"I think now we are seeing that permeate into policy, we are laying the foundations and building on them. There are one or two things where I would prefer if we were going further. I'd like us to be more explicit on education and the environment for example. We are spending a lot of time of the economy, and understandably so, but I want to see us be just as radical in social policy. I can understand why he might want to keep things under wraps though, because every time we come up with a cracker the Labour party nicks it. Some of those policies will be controversial, but we have to go out there and fight for them. Green taxes, for example, are a sore point for a lot of people, but we have to put the ideas out there, we have to debate and sort out what we think before there is an election.</p> <p>\"I also think we need to keep in mind, for every decision that we take, what does this approach mean for the bottom 25% of the electorate? I think if we are going to have tax cuts they need to be aimed at the lowest paid workers.\" </p> <h2>2. Tax: Should David Cameron offer more tax cuts than he has outlined already? </h2> <p>\"I think we need to be careful to remember what the Labour party does to us when we announce tax cuts and how they manipulate that. What we need is grassroots reform, not simply to hurl money at social problems. We believe in lower taxation, but the current economic situation is very poor so we are going to sort that out, protect public services. If there is any money left then we push for tax cuts.</p> <p>\"I think the party is going to have to walk a tightrope if elected, but I think we do need to be clear about a specific order of tax cuts that we will offer if possible in order to have more credibility.\" </p> <h2>3. Tax: If yes to the above, do you think they should be funded by <br>(a) cuts in public spending, or <br>(b) increases in other taxes</h2> <p>\"What will happen is that the growth in government spending will be less than the growth in the economy, but at the moment that growth in the economy is a big if at the moment. For the first few years I think a Conservative government would be very strapped for cash; our job is to turn the economy round so that we can afford tax cuts. At this stage the last thing that people need is more tax increases; families in my constituency are literally suffering. They are telling me that they are having to cut down on food at the moment so they can buy school uniforms, and that is atrocious. </p> <p>\"I don't think people now equate tax cuts with cuts in public services; five years ago if you talked about tax cuts people thought it meant that schools would be closing. But people no longer believe that pouring money into public services is going to get the right results; it is about what we do with that money. </p> <p>\"We have to convince the British people that we can get the same or better results for less money. I think they want to be convinced; tax cuts are back in fashion.\" </p> <h2>4. Tax: Should so-called \"green\" taxes increase? </h2> <p>\"I fundamentally believe that it is right to influence people's choices through the tax system and green taxes are a part of that. We need to see a lot more encouragement. I think this would see an initial rise in tax revenue while people change their behaviour and with that money we can cut taxes on good things, like families, so overall people are not paying any more. </p> <p>\"My only concern is if we are successful in changing people's attitudes then the amount of tax we raise from that will fall. How we bridge that gap we are not quite sure yet, but by the time it happens we will have the economy in a better shape and the growth will fill the gap. </p> <p>\"I also think with green taxes, like everything we do, we have to really consider how they will impact the lowest paid in society.\"</p> <h2>5. Tax: As a share of GDP tax is currently around 37%. After four years of a Conservative government would you expect it to be:<br>(a) substantially lower \u2013 at least 2 percentage points<br>(b) slightly lower<br>(c) much the same as it is now<br>(d) higher</h2> <p>\"In an ideal world we would want it to be substantially lower, but being realistic with the current situation I would just say it needs to be lower. We need to protect public services and kick-start the economy \u2013 that is our main concern. </p> <p>\"If we are reelected in 2014 then I would want it to be substantially lower than that.\" </p> <h2>6. Europe: On balance has Britain lost out or gained from its membership of the EU? If it has lost out, should it withdraw? </h2> <p>\"I'm not sure it is as simple as that. Some things have been very, very good, such as the work done on the environment and legislation around clean beaches etc. All that is very positive. But the areas in which we have suffered are in things like agriculture and fisheries. The EU is mired in corruption and suffers from a large democratic deficit; it needs changing and it needs sorting out. </p> <p>\"But you can't say, 'In that case, let's leave.' If it is not working then let's put it right. For years we have ground on about Europe but I think we have realised that people are more concerned about their standard of living. While we were just banging on about Europe we looked like we didn't care about their priorities. I think it will only play a small role in the next general election. I think people now know our views, they know we are Eurosceptic. I'm not sure what else we need.\"</p> <h2>7. Family: Which of the following statements most reflects your view:<br>(a) The tax system should be reformed to recognise and promote marriage<br>(b) The tax system should help parents regardless of their marital status </h2> <p>\"I think it is the commitment that marriage represents. I think we need to keep a broad definition of marriage. Gay parents, for example, should be rewarded for making a commitment to each other by having a civil partnership \u2013 I don't want it to be a narrow definition. </p> <p>\"It is more likely that parents will stay together if married and I think that if that creates more stability than that relationship should be encouraged.\"</p> <h2>8. Abortion: The House of Commons recently voted to maintain the upper limit of 24 weeks on abortion. Do you believe it should be reduced? If yes, by how many weeks? </h2> <p>\"I think it should be reduced. I would drastically reduce the number of weeks to between 12-16. Of course, there has to be some room for exceptions, but I think a foetus is a human at 12 weeks, just waiting to be born. For a child at 24 weeks to be terminated is heartbreaking. I think we need to give the unborn child more respect.\"</p> <p><strong>Interview by Alexandra Topping</strong></p>",
  "<h2>1. Perception: Do you consider yourself to be a progressive?</h2> <p>\"Progressives tend to be associated with democracy, reining in the political influence of big business, social justice, environmentalism. I'd like to see more of all these things, and in that sense am a progressive. But essentially I am a conservative who believes in decentralisation, the human scale, light government and trust. I believe a move towards direct democracy would bridge the gap between people and politics, and would result in a much more receptive decision-making process. \"</p> <h2>2. Tax: Should David Cameron offer more tax cuts than he has outlined already? </h2> <p>\"Yes. There's a mantra that cutting tax means cutting services. I think people are less inclined to believe that after 10 years of Labour. Without knowing what the state of our finances will be at the time of the next election, it's impossible to make detailed promises. But by cutting government waste, and dramatically, we could be sure of enormous savings.\"</p> <h2>3 Tax: If yes to the above, do you think they should be funded by <br>(a) cuts in public spending, or <br>(b) increases in other taxes?</h2> <p>\"There is a startling lack of delivery on government promises, not because of political dishonesty, but because the machinery of government itself is broken. There are too many people doing the same thing, and too little accountability. Hundreds of quangos occupy the same policy spaces, and the effect is a kind of paralysis. Good ideas are important for a government-in-waiting, but without brave structural reform, they will come to nothing. By streamlining government, making it work, I believe we'd see better results and huge savings for the taxpayer. That is the first priority.\"<br> <br></p> <h2>4. Tax: Should so-called \"green\" taxes increase? </h2> <p>\"Yes, but green taxes need to be totally transparent and honest, and they should never be retrospective. There's no point introducing punishments for choices already made. And where green taxes are raised, for example on the dirtiest new cars, the proceeds need to be used to reduce the cost of the cleanest cars. Green taxes must never become an excuse to raise revenue for the Treasury.\" </p> <h2>5. Tax: As a share of GDP tax is currently around 37%. After four years of a Conservative government would you expect it to be:<br>(a) substantially lower \u2013 at least 2 percentage points<br>(b) slightly lower<br>(c) much the same as it is now<br>(d) higher</h2> <p>\"I would hope the tax system would be simpler, and that the share of GDP tax would decline, but that very much depends on the state of the country's finances after 10 years of Labour.\"</p> <h2>6. Europe: On balance has Britain lost out or gained from its membership of the EU? If it has lost out, should it withdraw? </h2> <p>\"The EU provides a useful mechanism for working together on issues of common importance, not least the environment. But the organisation is structurally flawed and needs dramatic reform without which it's hard to see it either contributing usefully, or even surviving. The EU is far too bureaucratic, too grasping, and too wasteful. But the biggest problem with the EU is its lack of accountability. When the distance between people and power is too great, the former have little if any control over the latter. In the case of the EU, decision-makers are almost entirely insulated from any real democratic pressure, and that's always profoundly unhealthy. I would favour a lighter, more decentralised EU that learns the difference between national and genuinely international issues.\"</p> <h2>7. Family: Which of the following statements most reflects your view?<br>(a) The tax system should be reformed to recognise and promote marriage<br>(b) The tax system should help parents regardless of their marital status </h2> <p>\"It's wrong that the current benefits system gives couples with children more money if they live apart. That's perverse, and needs to be changed. But it's often single parents who need most support, and they mustn't be left stranded.\"</p> <h2>8. Abortion: The House of Commons recently voted to maintain the upper limit of 24 weeks on abortion. Do you believe it should be reduced? If yes, by how many weeks? </h2> <p>\"20 weeks is more than enough time for people to make a decision in favour of abortion. However, if after that time, serious medical problems are detected, that option should remain open throughout.\"</p> <p><strong>Interview by Alexandra Topping</strong></p>",
  "<p>A frenetic day on global financial markets saw stocks rally but shares in Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae plunge, as investors digested the full implications of the latest American plan to end the year-long credit crunch.</p> <p>Fears that the public ownership, or \"conservatorship\", of the two US mortgage giants might provide only a temporary boost for the US housing market, and the world's financial system more generally, meant that an initial 300-point gain on Wall Street's main share index was pared back later in the day.</p> <p>Dealers in London were frustrated as the London Stock Exchange's computerised trading system froze barely an hour into the day. It had put on 200 points, or almost 4%. Angry traders said the shutdown was an embarrassment for London and the exchange, which is under huge pressure from rivals for the lucrative earnings in the world's third-largest stock market.</p> <p>By lunchtime in New York the Dow Jones industrial average was up 180 points, or 1.6%, at around 11,400. The dollar strengthened against the pound to around $1.748 as it rose to its highest level in nearly a year. </p> <p>The US treasury secretary, Hank Paulson, said that the quasi-nationalisation of the two US mortgage giants, announced on Sunday, was needed because the companies were running a \"flawed business model\" that should never have been allowed.</p> <p>The mortgage giants had to be bailed out because of their importance to the mortgage market and the financial system, Paulson said, adding that the government's plan made sure that taxpayers were protected, but that shareholders would not be insulated from losses. As he spoke shares in Freddie and Fannie shed more than 80% of their value on Friday to trade at just over $1 a share.</p> <p>Analysts said the Freddie and Fannie bailout - the largest in US history - was unlikely to mark the beginning of the end of the global credit crunch.</p> <p>\"Our view is that, rather than marking the turning point that assures an economic recovery, the support that has had to be provided to the two US mortgage giants over the weekend simply underlines the severity of the ongoing credit crisis,\" said Julian Jessop at Capital Economics in London. \"The bailout will help to avoid the worst case scenario of a complete financial meltdown, but the outlook for the housing market and the wider economy remains grim.\"</p> <p>News emerged yesterday that the departing chief executives of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, Richard Syron and Daniel Mudd, will take combined severance pay of $23m. George Bush said he did not view the nationalisation of the troubled lenders as a \"bailout\", but a \"stabilisation\" to calm markets after the sell-off in shares seen last week.</p> <p>A White House spokeswoman added that Bush had been warning Congress for years about the danger posed by the two mortgage institutions and had been calling for a strong independent regulator. </p> <p>Analysts also said figures from the Mortgage Bankers Association on Friday had shown that the embattled US housing market was in much worse shape than thought, giving added urgency to the need for action. The largest US savings and loan business, Washington Mutual, was put under special regulatory supervision and ousted its chief executive, Kerry Killinger, following rising losses related to the US sub-prime mortgage market. Washington Mutual lost $6.3bn in the last three quarters and has said losses in its mortgage portfolio could approach $19bn by 2011.</p> <p>Some analysts speculated that Fannie and Freddie were likely to be under state control for at least two years.</p> <p>Barack Obama and John McCain grudgingly welcomed the treasury takeover of the mortgage companies as a necessary short-term intervention. But Republicans favour handing their portion of the mortgage market to privatised companies. The Democrats want to retain a public role, arguing that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac provide mortgages for people who would not otherwise be able to afford them.</p>",
  "<p>In 1962, at the height of the cold war, a young GI called James Joseph Dresnok picked up his gun and crossed the most heavily fortified border in the world to defect to the communist state of North Korea. He has been there ever since, living in the capital Pyongyang, although at one time both the North Koreans and the Americans denied he even existed.</p> <p>\"Comrade Joe\", as he is also known, is still regarded as a traitor in the United States and by the American soldiers who had to listen to his disembodied Tannoy broadcasts across the demilitarised zone promising better rations and women to those who cared to join him across the border. </p> <p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, Dresnok is wary of western journalists, but agreed to an interview following a request from the Labour MEP Glyn Ford, who has been engaged in diplomacy between North and South Korea and Japan for more than a decade. We meet in a wood-panelled room, underneath pictures of Great Leader Kim Il-sung and Dear Leader Kim Jong-il in Pyongyang's futuristic Koryo Hotel. Physically, Dresnok is a big man. His teeth are framed by a gold brace, and he sports a Great Leader badge, as do all North Koreans. At 67 he still smokes three packs a day despite a serious heart condition and warnings from his doctor at Pyongyang's Friendship Hospital. </p> <p>He has never seen himself as a traitor, he says, but was simply escaping to something he believed would give him purpose. His brief army career had been chequered and undistinguished. Having escaped an unhappy childhood of foster homes in Virginia, he enlisted in 1958, the day after his 17th birthday. He served first in Germany. After what he calls \"one minor offence\", he was treated harshly. \"I was forced to clean an armoured truck with a toothbrush and bucket of water. It was 42 below zero. That's when I first thought of crossing to a communist country. But if you went to the DDR (East Germany) they interrogated you and sent you back.\" </p> <p>He got his opportunity later, when serving with his unit along the demilitarised zone between North and South Korea in 1960. His wife had decided to leave him for another man after his two-year posting in Germany, which \"made me not care about my life,\" he says. \"I wanted to go to the most dangerous place in the world.\" </p> <p>There was nothing to keep him in the army, or in America. \"I didn't have any relatives back home, my wife had left me, I didn't have anything to live for in the US,\" Dresnok says. On the day he defected he faced a possible court martial for having absconded from his base. He had gone off limits having forged his officer's signature to go and meet a Korean woman he had become attached to. \"He [the officer] said, 'I want to see you at 3pm'. I said, 'We'll see'. That's when I made my decision to cross. I'm going for a new life. I grabbed a shotgun and headed for the DMZ [the demilitarised zone]. Sure, I knew about the personnel mines, maybe I could lose a foot or a leg - but I just went, straight.</p> <p>\"A cry went up, 'Hey Dresnok, stop!' So I just fired off a round to scare them. I have no regrets.\"</p> <p>When Dresnok crossed the border he was captured by a soldier from the Korean People's Army, who later volunteered, \"I wanted to kill the American bastard!\" He was taken to Pyongyang, where he was introduced to another defector, Private Larry Abshier. Over the next 18 months they were joined by two others, Army Sergeant Robert Jenkins and Specialist Jerry Parrish, presenting a remarkable propaganda victory for the hard-line regime of Kim Il-sung.</p> <p>\"Why should I regret crossing? I don't regret nothing,\" says Dresnok. Throughout the interview, his long-time North Korean minder sits beside him, noting down his answers. Dresnok appears loyal: \"The Great Leader Kim Il-sung told us, 'I am going to take you along with us to communism.' I didn't know then that the Great Leader would take good care of us like he did.\" But those early years were tough, he says. \"When I first came here, I didn't feel so good. People would say, 'There's that American bastard!'\" The Korean war, one of the most brutal conflicts of the last century, left an estimated four million dead, and a country shattered and divided to this day. \"People here, see, were educated to hate American imperialism. All that bombing! How many did they slaughter? They killed Koreans like savages. Of course people are going to hate Americans.\" </p> <p>In a mesmerising 2007 documentary, Crossing the Line, it was revealed that in 1966 Dresnok and fellow defectors Abshier, Parrish and Jenkins became so desperate to leave the North, they managed to get to the Soviet embassy and demand asylum. The Russians promptly handed them back. While Dresnok talks of the months and years of living quietly, learning the language, reading the works of the Great Leader, it was perhaps no accident that all four defectors managed around this time to find female companions. It seems entirely plausible that the women were found for them by the state, although none of the defectors ever admitted to any such arrangements. Dresnok has been married twice in North Korea; his first wife, a mysterious Romanian who always refused to talk of her past to Dresnok, died. He has since married the daughter of a former Togolese diplomat and a Korean. One of his three sons from his two Korean marriages looks American, although he doesn't sound it; a child of the revolution, James hopes to become a North Korean diplomat.</p> <p>\"I don't consider myself a traitor,\" Dresnok explains, referring to the country he turned his back on nearly half a century ago. \"I love my country. I love my town. In his teachings, Kim Il-sung wrote; 'Those who really love their country and their home can become communists.' I'm not a communist, but I would like to be one.\" </p> <p>Dresnok describes himself as a citizen of Pyongyang. \"I call it my country because I have been here for 46 years. My life is here. Enough? The government will take care of me until my dying breath.\" So would he like to return to the US? \"I tell you, yes; I must be honest to you. I would like to see the place. But how can I go there and dance in front of the American government, when they are arming South Korea?\" Dresnok knows that he would be arrested on arrival, as was Jenkins, when he returned to the west in 2004. There is no love lost between Dresnok and Jenkins, who recanted on his return just over three years ago, denounced Dresnok and was granted clemency after only 30 days in the clink. Were he ever to leave North Korea, Dresnok is unlikely to get off so lightly, having been painted as the ringleader by Jenkins. Abshier and Parrish both died in North Korea, where their families remain.</p> <p>But it is Dresnok's extraordinary career swap, from lowly US army private to star of the North Korean silver screen that provides the most surreal twist to his story. For three years from 1978, in a 20-part series called Nameless Heroes, directed by Kim Jong-il, Dresnok played the evil American. Ironically, these roles finally established the defectors' revolutionary credentials, and they were forgiven earlier misdemeanours. \"Comrade Kim Jong-il was then in the film industry. He was making movies,\" Dresnok recalls. \"He gave a teaching for us to take part in a film.\" (Dresnok is the first to admit that he is not an educated man, and that his grammar is sometimes mangled. </p> <p>\"I want my children to be more than an illiterate old man,\" he says disarmingly.) \"To be honest I was quaking in my shoes. I never thought I could be an actor.\" What critics would make of Comrade Joe Dresnok the actor is anyone's guess. But he made an impression on Kim Jong-il, now the ruler of North Korea. \"The Dear Leader takes care of me. Great man. Did you know hospitalisation is free in the DPRK?\"</p> <p>Despite the minder, at no point during the interview does Dresnok appear under duress. He smiles frequently, only becoming emotional when speaking bitterly of that \"cunning son of a bitch, Jenkins\". </p> <p>North Korea came into being 60 years ago today and since then predictions of its demise have been as frequent as they have been premature. Now history is once again threatening to repeat itself as the North prepares to rebuild its partially dismantled nuclear programme, in protest at the refusal of the US to remove it from the list of \"state sponsors of terror\". I ask Dresnok if he can explain why the US and Vietnam have long ago made up, but relations between the US and North Korea remain in deep freeze. \"It's long-time history,\" the unrepentant defector begins. \"The US planned to use North Korea as a stepping stone to China and Russia.\" And, he continues, \"The US is afraid right now. You know why? Now we have the nuclear bomb here. They don't want 'I blow you if you blow me'. But that is what will happen if they pull the trigger.\"</p> <p>And with that Comrade Joe prepares to return to his apartment, where his wife and children are waiting. It is illegal to listen to foreign broadcasts, but as he gets up Dresnok offers his opinion on the US election: \"I'm told McCain will get it.\" Dresnok, the last American defector, relic of a cold war that never came to an end on the Korean peninsula, a man whose impulsive decision either cost him 46 years of freedom, or gave him a better life than he had before, walks out and lights a cigarette.</p> <p><strong> \u00b7 </strong>Joe Dresnok, the Last American Defector, will be on Al Jazeera English today.</p>",
  "<h2>1. Perception: Do you consider yourself to be a progressive?</h2> <p>\"Yes. If you consider the most fundamental progressive ideals of all \u2013 equal opportunity and social mobility - it is clear that this Labour government has failed. </p> <p>\"Our plans for radical school reform - bringing the best education to the poorest children by opening up the state system to new providers - show we are not prepared to let ideology, dogma or vested interests stop children gaining the best start in life. We want to create genuine opportunities for people from any background to get on in life. </p> <p>\"And to address the growing gap in opportunity between children from rich and poor backgrounds, we have explicitly committed to the creation of a premium to be added to the per-pupil funding children from disadvantaged backgrounds receive. </p> <p>\"We want to ensure educational resources are targeted more effectively on those in need, to give incentives to schools to take children from more challenging backgrounds and to give incentives to new providers to locate in areas of greater disadvantage.\" </p> <h2>2. Tax: Should David Cameron offer more tax cuts than he has outlined already? </h2> <p>\"David Cameron and George Osborne have been very clear that a Conservative government will not promise up-front, unfunded tax cuts at the next election. We will always put the stability of the national economy before promises of tax cuts - and we don't yet know just how much of a mess Gordon Brown will leave the country's finances in.</p> <p>\"However, we do believe in low taxes - because we believe low taxes are both morally right and economically efficient. But we are the party of low taxes for the long term, not tax cut promises for the short term. </p> <p>\"That is why David Cameron has said that a Conservative government will live within its means, by tackling the three cause of a bigger state and rising public spending. First, by tackling the costs of social failure, such as family breakdown, unemployment, and drug and alcohol addiction. </p> <p>\"Second, by tackling the cost of unreformed public services, improving the way they run through more choice, competition and non-state collective provision. And third, by tackling the cost of bureaucracy, halting the wasteful spending and inefficiency we've seen under Labour.\"</p> <h2>3.

The number of people in deep poverty has risen by 900,000 under Labour, the poorest now pay more of their income in tax than the richest, the gap between poorer and better off students is growing, and rising public borrowing and economic incompetence are placing unfair burdens on future generations. </p> <p>\"It's clear that fair and progressive goals can only be delivered by<br>Conservative means, and our emphasis on opportunity and responsibility will succeed where Labour's top-down state control has failed.\"</p> <h2>6. Europe: On balance has Britain lost out or gained from its membership of the EU? If it has lost out, should it withdraw? </h2> <p>\"Britain has gained from being in the EU it does much that is worthwhile: allowing people, services, workers and goods to move freely across Europe in a market of 500 million. The EU also provides a unique means for us to work together with our European partners on shared challenges which Europe's nation states by themselves cannot deal with; and with enlargement, the goal of EU membership has persuaded not just governments but whole societies to raise their standards across the board.</p> <p>\"We want Britain to be a positive participant in the EU, championing liberal values. </p> <p>\"However, there is certainly a great deal that is wrong \u2013 the persistent attempts to take ever more powers from nation states, the mismanaged budget, the failures of the common fisheries policy and, sadly, more - which is why we have campaigned for reform and modernisation in the EU. We believe in an open, flexible Europe fit for the 21st century.</p> <p>\"If the EU has as its priorities the areas where it can make the most positive difference for its members and in the world - on global warming, global competitiveness and global poverty - and if it stops navel-gazing about institutions and doesn't try to impose unwanted top-down centralisation on its peoples then it can be an even stronger force for good in its second half-century. \"</p> <h2>7.

  "<p>Controversial surgery for treating obesity that involves reducing the patient's stomach to the size of a thumb should be more widely available on the NHS, according to researchers. They say a lack of resources and prejudice from some doctors is preventing many morbidly obese patients from receiving life-saving surgery.</p> <p>Dr Carel Le Roux at Imperial College London and his colleague Dr Rachel Batterham are calling for 10 times the number of operations currently performed. At present around 6,000 people receive the surgery each year but guidelines from the National Institute of Clinical Excellence say the number should be 60,000. </p> <p>Currently only patients with a BMI of 35 or over are eligible, but the scientists say more research is needed to work out whether this criterion should be extended. A BMI of 25 or higher is considered overweight. Thirty or more is obese. </p> <p>\"We are shooting way low at the moment,\" said Le Roux. \"We actually don't have the infrastructure to look after these patients.\"</p> <p>Around two-thirds of the UK population is overweight or obese. \"What we need to know is which patients would benefit from this operation and I think that evidence is lacking,\" Le Roux told the British Association festival. </p> <p>Gastric bypass surgery involves closing off part of the stomach and replumbing the new smaller stomach into a point further down the small intestine. Traditionally, this was seen as a crude way to reduce the ability of the gut to absorb energy from food. \"Physicians had thought this was bad news for a long time,\" said Le Roux. Some doctors have also been critical of what has been seen as \"lifestyle surgery\".</p> <p>But Le Roux said more recent research has found the surgery leads to subtle changes in hormone levels that determine how hungry the patient feels. In many cases it also cures type two diabetes.</p> <p>In the long term Le Roux and Batterham hope to recreate these changes using drugs, but in the meantime they say the \u00a39,000 operation can make a huge difference to patients. \"The holy grail of understanding how this works is that it will potentially lead to a cure for obesity and type two diabetes,\" said Batterham, who works at the centre for diabetes and endocrinology at University College London.</p>",
  "<p>Thailand's beleaguered prime minister appeared in court yesterday to defend his popular cooking show against accusations that his extra-curricular activities violated the constitution. Samak Sundaravej, the irascible rightwinger and gourmet, spent an hour in the witness box defending the television programme, Tasting, Grumbling, a mix of tips on traditional Thai cooking and rants on subjects of his choosing that could see him forced to resign.</p> <p>He gave up the show in April, more than two months after becoming prime minister. However, if the constitutional court, which is due to deliver its decision today, finds that he did work for a private company while in office, the 73-year-old could be forced to stand down, just seven months after he took office at the head of a six-party coalition.</p> <p>Samak's mounting woes come after he declared a state of emergency in Bangkok when clashes between government supporters and opponents left one man dead and dozens injured.</p> <p>More than 5,000 anti-government demonstrators from the People's Alliance for Democracy have been camped in the grounds of his offices for nearly two weeks, accusing him of corruption and demanding his resignation. The protesters' constant diet of music and political speeches has prevented Samak and his ministers from entering their offices. </p> <p>Samak hosted Tasting, Grumbling for a number of years before he became prime minister, though it was off air for some months after the government appointed by the leaders of the 2006 coup closed down the state broadcaster. The channel was resurrected when Samak took office and he made about half a dozen appearances on the show before stepping down. Senators accused him of breaching the constitution by working for a private company while in office and filed a petition.</p> <p>In court, Samak defended his actions, saying he was not employed by the television company, but had received a small fee and the cost of his transportation to the studio. \"I was hired to appear on the programme and got paid from time to time,\" he said. \"I was not an employee of the company, so I did not violate the law. I presented the cooking show and got paid for my acting.\"</p> <p>The managing director of the company that produced the programmes, Sakchai Khaewwaneesakul, testified that Samak was paid 80,000 baht (\u00a31,250) for four shows. \"The presenters of our show are not our employees,\" he said. \"But we pay them honorariums.\"</p> <p>Samak was indicted by an independent watchdog, the National Counter Corruption Commission, which forwarded the allegation to the constitutional court.</p> <p>In the event that the court decides to disqualify Samak, it could defuse much of the political tension that has beset Thailand for months. \"By making a quick decision, the court will help a lot in resolving the political crisis,\" said Suwat Apaiakdi, a lawyer for the senators who lodged the petition. \"If the court rules that prime minister Samak is disqualified from holding office, then the political crisis could automatically cease.\"</p> <p>The election commission ruled last week that Samak's People Power party had committed electoral fraud and should be disbanded, a case that is also expected to end up before the constitutional court.</p> <p>Apart from the cooking show charge, Samak also has been accused of defamation by Bangkok's deputy governor, Samart Rajpholasit. A lower court sentenced Samak to three years in jail, and an appeals court is expected to rule on September 25 whether to uphold the sentence.</p>",
  "<p>British American Tobacco has become the latest UK company to be targeted in Russia with threats of legal action by the country's consumer rights agency, Rospotrebnadzor. </p> <p>Gennady Onishchenko, director of Rospotrebnadzor, said yesterday that he had signed a lawsuit against BAT for \"misleading\" consumers and infringing their rights, although he would not give details.</p> <p>A few weeks ago he attacked the wider global tobacco companies, threatening them with legal action for \"nicotine genocide\", allegedly for making huge profits at the expense of Russians' health. </p> <p>Yesterday Onishchenko repeated those claims, saying the tobacco producers viewed Russia as \"an uncivilised market where they can sell dangerous and poisonous products\". </p> <p>BAT said last night that it had received no claims from the regulator, but stressed it always acted inside the law. The London-based group has been a keen purchaser of local tobacco companies and has also found Russia a growing market for its top brands, such as Dunhill and Kent.</p> <p>Western companies in the oil and mining sectors have faced similar attacks by environmental and financial watchdogs, which have usually been interpreted as attempts by the Kremlin to crack down on foreign firms.</p> <p>Last week BP agreed to make wholesale changes to the management structure of its TNK-BP joint venture - including the removal of its chief executive, Robert Dudley, a former BP man. Shell handed over a large share of its Sakhalin gas field business to the state-owned Gazprom after destabilising criticism from regulators.</p> <p>The relationship between Russia and western investors has been soured by military intervention in Georgia. UK-Russian relations are poor since the killing in London of Alexander Litvinenko.</p> <p>BAT said no claim from the consumer body would be justified. \"We have yet to receive an official claim from Mr Onishchenko on this subject, so are not aware of any details.\" Market watchers said the suit was likely to focus on \"light\" and \"superlight\" labelling on cigarette packs.</p> <p>The Kremlin has acknowledged that the country must do more to combat smoking. Russia recently ratified the World Health Organisation's framework convention on tobacco control, which mandates a series of measures within five years, including higher prices for cigarettes.</p>",
  "<p>The idea of going on school trips, let alone organising them, fills most teachers with dread. Trips can be fraught with potential disaster but almost all enrich children's learning, enliven classroom discussion and should pose no problem with a bit of careful planning.</p> <p>The government is keen that schools take more children on journeys. Ministers launched the Learning Outside the Classroom manifesto in 2006 and \u00a32.7m has gone towards trips, up to 10m of which take place each year.</p> <p>Research is the key. Keep an eye on events going on at local museums, theatres and galleries that might tie in with the curriculum.</p> <p>The website www.24hourmuseum.org.uk lists activities at over 3,000 sites around the country and pow.reonline.org.uk offers a choice of religious venues. Growing Schools is a governmental programme to encourage school trips about food farming and the countryside, which has a teacher-support website, while the Adventure Activities Licensing Authority (AALA) lists vetted providers.</p> <p>What do you want pupils to get out of the trip? The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) insists that visits should have clear educational objectives.</p> <p>Taking art students on a trip to a gallery is obvious but the British Horseracing Education and Standards Trust suggests a trip to the racecourse to learn about maths. The National Centre for Excellence in the Teaching of Mathematics (NCETM) lists other trips with a numerical bent.</p> <p>Your school's educational visits coordinator (EVC) should be able to help but a myriad of private companies will do the job for you, if you can persuade the headteacher to pay for their services.</p> <p><strong>Good communication</strong></p> <p>The Association of School and College Leaders endorses schooltrip.com, an agency set up by a school in Reading and run by a former pupil, and World Challenge for overseas trips.</p> <p>The National Association of Headteachers recommends www.schooltripsplus.co.uk, which provides a searchable database of over 7,000 possible destinations, free of charge for schools to use, and a low-cost comprehensive communications tool (including wristbands for children, messaging service and daily bulletins) enabling schools, parents and children to remain in contact during a school trip. </p> <p>Carrying out a risk assessment is a legal requirement when planning any outing. It should include how many members of staff or adults you need to run a visit safely, identify possible hazards and take into account the age and experience of pupils and the appropriateness of any activities. If the intention is to go abroad, the National Union of Teachers advises contacting embassies or tourist offices early to check how laws differ.</p> <p>Guidance from the Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL) cites the example of the danger of road traffic accidents involved in travel - advising teachers to ensure they have a qualified driver and a well-maintained bus fitted with seatbelts that children wear mitigates the risk. Incidentally, tube travel is free for school groups in London (see Transport for London website).</p> <p>Students' medical and behavioural needs should be considered as well as weather conditions. Make sure you keep thorough records and check everything with your school's EVC or the local authority's (LA) outdoor education adviser.</p> <p>Do not forget to plan for emergencies. The Heath and Safety Executive recommends that you consider how the party might respond to a serious incident and identify procedures for getting help. </p> <p>And risk assessment does not stop when the trip starts. Trip leaders should also not allow pressure from children or helpers to cloud their judgment. If any warnings are given or participants are reluctant to do a planned activity on safety grounds, the risks should be reassessed.</p> <p><strong>Parental consent</strong></p> <p>Getting informed parental consent is essential before any trip. The ATL says letters should include information on the following points: the date and purpose of the visit; departure and return times; collection points; travel arrangements; number of students and supervision arrangements; accommodation; provision for special educational or medical needs; procedures for unwell students; the names of the group leader and other staff and adults; activities, risks and how they will be managed; insurance arrangements (check with the school); what clothing, equipment and money should be taken by each student, and what the total cost of the visit will be.</p> <p>Parents should provide teachers with all relevant information, such as allergies or dietary requirements, travel sickness or sleeping difficulties.</p> <p>In terms of supervision, there are no legal requirements. However, the Department for Children, Schools and Families does recommend one adult per six pupils under age seven, or per 20 pupils age under 18. ATL advises at least two adults (one female, one male for mixed sex groups and with first aid) per group of 20 pupils.</p> <p>Schools have a legal duty to give children the same sort of care as \"good parents\". On residential trips this means teachers are, in practice, constantly on duty. But it is accepted that even the best parent cannot be blamed if a child trips or slips doing the kind of things a child of that age would normally do, especially after appropriate precautions.</p> <p>Take comfort from Voice, the teaching union: you can only commit a health and safety offence by willfully doing something you know is wrong, ignoring HSE policy or failing to take reasonable care.

  "<p>School is something that cuts to the heart of us all. It was when we experienced life as social beings for the first time and when, in most cases, we were the most scared in our lives - a fact to which we devote, in adult life, a great deal of subconscious energy to suppressing and forgetting. It is most intense when the pupils are in their late teens: old enough to be almost-adults (old enough in this country, in fact, to serve in the armed forces), old enough to feel the pain of humiliation, despair, a broken heart, and also rapture and love, but without yet having grown the vital thick skin of cynicism and experience that allows adults to manage and contain these feelings.</p> <p>No wonder that for many people school was the most vivid period, perhaps the only real period of their lives. And it is strange to think that some of the teachers we knew, and to whom we were closest at this late stage in our school careers, were maybe just five years older than we were then. How extraordinary to realise that some of the gruffest teachers who terrified you the most were younger than you are now.</p> <p>Looking through the proposed list of Forty Great School Movies, on which teachers will be voting with a view to creating a \"best of\" compilation programme, I experienced precisely the same feeling I had when compiling a similar list for Education Guardian a few years ago.</p> <p>Scanning these great titles ... Kes, Zero de conduite, Election, If... made me think: wait, why aren't there more films about school and schooldays? Why, in fact, aren't all films about school? After all, the genre is such a rich seam: it's got such potential for heartbreak, for passion, for violence - of both the metaphorical and literal sort. And it also has such an enormous capacity for idealism.</p> <p>It is intriguing because it offers two social worlds: the world of child-pupils and the world of adult-teachers, which I mentally label \"playground\" and \"staffroom\" - which overlap as in a kind of Venn diagram in the classroom itself. The private emotional lives of the children may be a mystery to the teachers, and those of the teachers are certainly opaque to the pupils. Most of the time. But it is when this private business encroaches onto the formal world of the classroom, that ritual arena of disinterested learning which is in fact so easily encroached upon, that the classic drama begins.</p> <p>There's always a nerdish pleasure in pointing out omissions to a list, but I can't help but regret that the organisers of this poll have not included Henri-Georges Clouzot's Les Diaboliques, a French suspense thriller from 1955. A horrible, disciplinarian headmaster - and corporal punishment enthusiast, naturally - is beastly to pupils and staff alike. He beats his wife and has just dumped his mistress, who is one of the teachers. So the spurned mistress makes a sensational proposal to the beaten wife, no longer her rival but a sister in oppression.</p> <p>They will murder the headmaster and dump his body in the school swimming pool, making it look like suicide or an accident.</p> <p><strong>Violent fantasy</strong></p> <p>School is an exquisitely appropriate context for this scheme: as it is a place where violence lingers heavily in the air. Children were beaten routinely, at school and home, and male violence towards women was urbanely tolerated. Ingeniously, Clouzot yokes the two together and invents a revenge drama. Children everywhere must have fantasised about revenge on a horrible schoolmaster: it is a wish-fulfilment fantasy for grown-ups and children alike.</p> <p>Violence at school was so commonplace until relatively recently. (You may remember an arch reality TV show recently called That'll Teach 'Em, in which modern schoolkids supposedly endured the rigours of a 1950s-style grammar-school education. It was of course meaningless, because no one got beaten. Corporal punishment was not mentioned, still less practised. On this programme, the nasty little secret of traditional educational values remained a secret.)</p> <p>This was generally a subject of jollity in 50s school film: think of Jimmy Edwards in his chalk-dusted mortarboard and gown, thwacking away. But there is a startling exception to this: Carry On Teacher has a remarkable scene in the staffroom in which the masters debate the matter in all seriousness, and Kenneth Williams plays a teacher who says that though he will sometimes beat a boy if there is no alternative, he does so with an awful feeling of failure. I rather admire the Carry Ons for including this moment, and not going along with the dishonest pose that it was something that could be taken lightly.</p> <p>I went to a liberal independent school in the 1970s, Haberdashers' Aske's in Borehamwood in Hertfordshire. It had an excellent no-corporal-punishment rule, but some of the masters certainly felt entitled to hand out the odd informal clump. I never received any such punishments and witnessed only one. Two boys were talking in a corridor just before going into a lesson (against the rules) and I saw a teacher literally bang their heads together. It was a petty, yet completely disgusting act of violence: an assault, in fact, by the stronger upon the weaker. Even today I wince when I read journalists casually using that image. I remember that the event was made even more contemptible by the master visibly realising in the next fraction of a second what an unforgivable thing he had done, and in a breezy, cowardly way, trying to laugh it off.</p> <p>There are two great films about violence in school: Lindsay Anderson's If... and Gus Van Sant's Elephant. A key moment in the first film comes when Malcolm McDowell's rebel is required to submit to a beating not from a master, but from one of the prefects, and he is in a kind of anguished rage about whether or not he should take it - a parable, though a brutal one, for the anguish suffered by many bright high-schoolers suddenly confronted by adult rules which they realise for the first time in their lives are wrong, and being practised by people who are stupid and culpable. They realise that they do have a choice, of sorts, about whether to submit to these rules.</p> <p>When McDowell finally opens up with a gun on the school, however, it is a bizarre moment of satire, with an edge of un-seriousness, fantasy and even flippancy, which for my money rather undermines the impact of the picture.</p> <p>In Gus Van Sant's Elephant, the violence is all too serious, inspired by the Columbine massacre - which was also the starting point of Michael Moore's anti-gun docu-polemic Bowling For Columbine.</p> <p>(Interestingly, his title is a reference to Alan Clarke's Elephant, a stark cine-prose-poem about violence in Northern Ireland.) The violence is all the more disturbing for being filmed in such an affectless, un-dramatic way. It is, of course, an unrepresentative film in that most schools, thankfully - even in the US, and certainly the UK - are not subject to apocalyptic gun violence.</p> <p>Yet in its horror, its very extremity, Elephant speaks to a sizable proportion of people for whom school was an endurance test and a grim ritual of humiliation and mortification, in which revenge fantasies might well have found fertile ground.</p> <p>So much for violence. Sex is a rather more taboo subject. Powerful films such as M\u00e4dchen In Uniform and especially Children's Hour raised the subject of gay sexual identity, and Children's Hour is especially interesting in that it is about the power that pupils do sometimes have over their adult rulers in the self-enclosed city state of school. </p> <p>But my favourite school film on this theme, and the film that would come top of my poll, is Alexander Payne's Election of 1999, a film of inspired incorrectness, which I can only describe as the Animal Farm of sexual politics and a brilliant parable for 90s America in the Monica Lewinsky era.</p> <p>A decent, hard-working yet stressed high-school teacher (played by Matthew Broderick) is feeling a vague sense of mid-life dissatisfaction. His marriage is in difficulties, due to a failure to produce children, and although entirely convinced of the value of his work, he is increasingly aware that he is going through the same things, year after year. It is at this delicate time of his life that he conceives an unwholesome obsession with a bright, irritatingly conceited, over-achieving student, Tracy Flick, played by Reese Witherspoon - the greatest performance of her career. He is sexually fascinated by her, and also irritated by the fact that her flirtatious manner (which he suspects is far more adult and knowing than she lets on) has ruined the career of a friend of his.</p> <p><strong>Envy of the young</strong></p> <p>Most importantly, and most abysmally, he is actually envious of her: envious that she will probably grow up to get a more prestigious and better-paid job than his. This is the envy and hatred that the old feel for the young, and which, as Germaine Greer wrote, threatened men feel for women in general. So he plans to wreck her chances at the upcoming election for school president.</p> <p>The idea of teachers not merely lusting after but actually nailing the pupils is the unmentionable of unmentionables, but Election fearlessly tackles it.</p> <p>Broderick tentatively runs through her qualities, concluding: \"There's something else you should know about Tracy...\" and we cut to her debauched teacher-lover whispering gleefully direct to camera: \"Her pussy gets so wet...!\" It's a gloriously offensive moment, smashing the Ming vase of appropriate thought and politically correct language - a veritable Hendrix power chord of crass honesty about the degraded pedagogic ego.</p> <p>These are examples, mostly, of cynicism and irony and alienation. But there are in fact, great school films composed in a cinematic language quite different from this. Ken Loach's Kes, for all its great moments of comedy, is a serious film about the shortcomings of school. An old warhorse like Goodbye Mr Chips takes the idea of an inspirational, self-sacrificing teacher very seriously.</p> <p>For my money, one of the best films to emerge this year (and the winner of the 2008 Cannes Golden Palm) is a school film in precisely this non-ironic vein: this is Laurent Cantet's Entre les murs, or Within The Walls - that is, the walls of the classroom. (Perhaps In Class would be the best translation, or just Class.) It is based on a novel by Fran\u00e7ois B\u00e9gaudeau, which was in turn based on his own experiences teaching in a tough Paris school. Remarkably, B\u00e9gaudeau plays himself in the film, whose plot turns on the fact that some of the pupils are entitled to attend teacher conferences as pupil \"reps\", and start indiscreetly feeding back the teachers' remarks to the errant pupils in question, which starts a monumental confrontation in class.</p> <p>The fascination of the film is often simply in the non-controversial business of teaching: a longish sequence in which Fran\u00e7ois talks about grammar, without any great dramatic subtext, is absolutely gripping: I could watch it all day. </p> <p>But to return to the three Venn diagram fields I proposed earlier - \"schoolyard\" \"classroom\" and \"staffroom\" - the meat of Entre les murs is in the transgression, or the leaking from one to the other. Children are allowed out of the classroom into the staffroom to eavesdrop on the discussion of their elders. Then, in the film's final dramatic scene, Fran\u00e7ois leaves the castle keep of the classroom - the stronghold of his authority - and goes down into the schoolyard to explain and justify his behaviour in front of a boisterous jury of pupils, whom he has come to respect.</p> <p>A great film, in a great school-film tradition. Voting for the best ones is always fiendishly difficult, but if pushed, I would go for Election or Entre les murs.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Watch clips of the top 40 films: <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/sep/09/schools.movies.clips.ag\">A-G</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/sep/09/schools.movies.clips.hz\">H-Z</a></strong></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Everyone has a favourite movie set in a school.

  "<p>England is spending more on schools than ever - and this will no doubt be reflected today when the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) publishes its chunky annual tome comparing member countries' educational performance. </p> <p>At more than 400 pages, Education at a Glance feels more like a glazed stare at a mass of tables and statistics gathered from around the developed world. And, of course, ministers will find some figures in there that show their policies are delivering. </p> <p>But is the English formula of more money and more testing really working?</p> <p>The government can point to more pupils reaching the required levels in Sats tests at the ages of seven, 11 and 14, as well as rising results for 16-year-olds at GCSE and 18-year-olds at A-level. And even if some of the Sats scores appear to have stalled, they are still better than when Labour took over in 1997. </p> <p><strong>Less flattering</strong></p> <p>But international comparisons are less flattering to the government. The OECD international rankings place the UK 13th in reading this year - down from seventh in 2000 - and 18th in maths. Despite increased spending, the UK hovers around the OECD average for both reading and maths. And this primarily reflects performance in England. </p> <p>It would appear that the \u00a340m being currently spent on Sats tests is a complete farce. </p> <p>They are not only failing to improve education in England, but may be driving down standards as schools reduce their curriculums and teach to the tests. </p> <p>In Melbourne, Australia, 84% of pupils stay at school until the end of secondary education, compared with only 41% in England. This may be because Melbourne offers a more meaningful, relevant and flexible curriculum that caters for individual career paths. The English model seems plagued by anomalies. Having failed to adopt the Tomlinson model that was proposed in 2003 and offered a more integrated programme, the government is now attempting to retain pupils through statutory regulation. </p> <p>How can England compete internationally when its educational model is outdated, and its institutions are slow to respond to change? </p> <p>Gordon Wells, an education professor at the University of California, has argued that we think and learn best through dialogue with our peers. He suggests pupils learn best from one another, with the support of teachers and parents. </p> <p>This approach is favoured by countries such as Sweden and Finland, where learning is guided by \"formative assessment\" that informs teaching throughout the academic year. </p> <p>The OECD data shows that the most successful countries operate liberal curriculum models that recognise the needs of the individual over blanket national testing. Is this merely a coincidence? </p> <p><strong>Competitive culture</strong></p> <p>It is a fallacy to think that testing exists only at key stage levels in England. The competitive culture established by national testing permeates every year, from primary to secondary. How can pupils contemplate having dialogue with their peers to develop as independent, resourceful learners while their local culture is compromised by central government testing?</p> <p>Persuasive terms such as \"rigorous testing\", intended to reassure communities that standards are being upheld, actually refer to a convenient data-collection method, which serves to empower government through greater control over an electorally sensitive area of public policy. This raises serious questions about the validity of tests that function as indicators of success for both pupils and schools, resulting in a distortion of teaching and learning. </p> <p>There is an emerging body of evidence to suggest that national tests are not educationally valid and should no longer determine learning and curriculum content. The social connections between learners are far more complex and valuable than the Department for Children, Schools and Families would have us believe.</p>",
  "<p>The first edition of the Joy of Sex considered sex on moving motorbikes. \"If you have access to a private road, the hazards are yours,\" counselled the book's ironically surnamed author Dr Alex Comfort. Thirty-six years and 8m copies in 22 languages later, that passage has been excised from the New Joy of Sex. Funless if sensible safety legislation has since made sex on moving motorbikes illegal. Doing it on horseback (as mentioned in the 1972 edition) is also outlawed. So stop that too. </p> <p>More importantly, The New Joy of Sex offers a woman's perspective for the first time. Psychologist Susan Quilliam has updated the original manual with 43 new sections. While acknowledging that Comfort was \"fully committed to women's pleasure\", Quilliam argues that we have since learned more about how to achieve it. So, for instance, there's much more on the clitoris (the old edition had only four sentences). Hurrah! But the book's still only targeted at straight couples. Boo!</p> <p>Quilliam's updated version aims to reflect four decades of socio-sexual change. Out goes the prostitution section (\"We didn't think it had anything to do with loving relationships\"). In come hormones, sex shops, striptease, sex during pregnancy, and a harrowing section on penis injuries caused by vacuum cleaners (\"very hard to repair satisfactorily\").</p> <p>There's also lots about cybersex. \"Text, email, webcams, teledildonics can all be used to wind each other up to fever pitch during the working day prior to extended evening action,\" she writes. Quilliam, though, might have mentioned that some bosses frown on virtual foreplay during office hours. </p> <p>Some things remain. The big toe, for instance. \"The pad of the male big toe applied to the clitoris or the vulva generally is a magnificent erotic instrument,\" wrote Comfort, words that appear unchanged in the new edition. Quilliam reckons to have cut only 9% of the original. </p> <p>And there is also a section about horses, though not about lovemaking while astride moving ones. Equine roleplay has been practised since Aristotle was ridden horse-style by his lover. Those with bigger budgets than his might consider using a bit and saddle, or even pulling a small trap during S&amp;M sessions, Quilliam suggests. \"Either sex can be the steed,\" she adds, in a remark typifying The New Joy of Sex's egalitarian spirit. Happy days!</p>",

I am not one of the usual candidates; I have been selected against the odds; I'm a truly local candidate \u2014 so yes I am part of the Cameroonian 'progressivism', which I think means we are connected to the ordinary people of the country and we need to prove that.</p> <p>\"I think that endorsement of marriage as a successful institution is one that should be promoted within society and society should recognise and reward.</p> <p>\"We also need to promote other relationships horizontal and vertical \u2013 grandparents for instance. I think that eastern European migrants and Muslims have got a lot to teach about better relationships with grandparents and respect for elders. We are dealing with so many people that have been thrown on the scrapheap and all they are being offered at present is sticky tape. \"</p> <h2>2. Tax: Should David Cameron offer more tax cuts than he has outlined already? </h2> <p>\"Yes, but as a financial investment adviser the rules of economics prove that if you make an investment you expect return. If you make tax breaks carefully you will get a return on your investment such as leaving more money in the hands of the general entrepreneur.\"</p> <h2>3. Tax: If yes to the above, do you think they should be funded by <br>(a) cuts in public spending, or <br>(b) increases in other taxes</h2> <p>[Did not choose a or b] \"Tax breaks leave more money in the hands of genuine entrepreneurs.\"</p> <h2>4. Tax: Should so-called \"green\" taxes increase? </h2> <p>\"People tend to feel that it's another tax that does not generate genuine green savings. We all need more substantial incentives to be energy saving. Such as subsidised ground heat pumps or solar panels. The more people that can buy them the more prices come down and the more energy we save. Brown hasn't reduced energy taxes in response to fuel price rises when he could do that.\"</p> <h2>5. Tax: As a share of GDP tax is currently around 37%. After four years of a Conservative government would you expect it to be:<br>(a) substantially lower \u2013 at least 2 percentage points<br>(b) slightly lower<br>(c) much the same as it is now<br>(d) higher</h2> <p>\"The politicians answer is that you want preserve and grow the quality and expanse of public services. At the same time you want to leave people with most of their own money, because you trust them to spend it wisely. That's the traditional Tory ethic.\"</p> <h2>6. Europe: On balance has Britain lost out or gained from its membership of the EU? If it has lost out, should it withdraw? </h2> <p>\"We are a long way from Europe in North Devon. I want to be in Europe but not ruled by Europe. We are on the receiving end of a raft of oppressive legislation from Europe and its time to say no to certain things. We don't need the Euro \u2013 its bad for Spain, France and Germany as well. It's not a sensible thing to have a common currency.\"</p> <h2>7. Family: Which of the following statements most reflects your view:<br>(a) The tax system should be reformed to recognise and promote marriage<br>(b) The tax system should help parents regardless of their marital status </h2> <p>\"I am an a) and I'll tell you why. Would you prefer to be a single mum with a series of failed relationships with males, in preference to having a stable settled relationship with one man for the rest of your life. We seem to be championing the fact that its all right to be accepting the second best route at the moment when committed relationships are probably the best route and there is evidence of less social problems, alcoholism, crime etc when people are in stable relationships.\"</p> <h2>8. Abortion: The House of Commons recently voted to maintain the upper limit of 24 weeks on abortion. Do you believe it should be reduced? If yes, by how many weeks? </h2> <p>\"Yes, it should be reduced but I don't take a totalitarian view. I think that if medical science can save child then that child should be saved. I think Nadine Dorries view (to reduce the upper limit to 20 weeks) was the most appropriate. I think I come down on the side of the unborn child on this one. At the moment there are too many abortions, too many morning after pills, they give them out without parental knowledge at my daughter's school. Women seem to think that they can take morning after pills as easily as headache pills. But it all comes down to the commodification of sex at the expense of real relationships.\"</p> <p><strong>Interview by Mark Gould</strong></p>",
  "<p>Scotland should get its own digital television channel and more money to address a significant imbalance in its share of national broadcasting, an independent inquiry has decided. </p> <p>The Scottish Broadcasting Commission says today that UK broadcasters are failing to properly serve their audiences in Scotland or spend a fair proportion of their budgets on Scottish programmes - a deficit the industry's regulators and successive governments have also failed to correct. </p> <p>The commission, set up 13 months ago by Alex Salmond, the first minister, said Scotland needed a publicly-funded digital channel with its own news bulletins and a budget big enough to commission current affairs, drama and entertainment.</p> <p>Eventually, the commission believes, this channel would generate major series for a UK audience such as the crime series Rebus, children's programmes such as Balamory or the comedy Still Game. It would also be shown UK-wide on satellite, Freeview or cable.</p> <p>Blair Jenkins, the commission's chairman, said: \"It will meet the clear demand from people in Scotland for a greater volume and range of Scottish programmes and it will help to fulfil the economic, cultural and democratic imperatives of Scottish broadcasting.\"</p> <p>The commission also urged the BBC's director general, Mark Thompson, to substantially improve his pledge to spend 8.6% of its programming budget in Scotland, based on its population share, by delivering it by 2012, four years earlier than planned. Channel 4 was also urged to increase its spending to that level if it wanted to continue receiving public subsidy.</p> <p>But the commission failed to support Salmond's demand for a Scottish-made evening news programme to replace the BBC's evening bulletin in its 22 recommendations. </p> <p>The commission, which included the former Tory and Labour ministers Lord Fraser and Henry McLeish, also distanced itself from another Scottish National party demand, that control over broadcasting in Scotland be entirely devolved to the Holyrood parliament. It said the Scottish parliament should just have greater oversight of broadcasting in Scotland rather than legal control. Even so, Salmond welcomed the report. \"It represents nothing less than a blueprint for a revolution in Scottish broadcasting,\" he said.</p> <p>Jenkins, who reputedly resigned as BBC Scotland's head of news and current affairs in protest at spending cuts in 2006, suggested the \"Scottish Network\" would need between \u00a350m and \u00a375m in public funding - close to the \u00a395m spent on the Welsh language channel S4C. The BBC said: \"We would ... want to look at the proposed channel's structure, content and funding in the first instance to ensure it meets audience needs and demands as well as delivering value for money.\"</p>",
  "<p>A three-year-old girl sucked into a hidden storm drain as she played in a park was forced for 70 metres through an underground concrete pipe before her father leapt into a swollen river to save her.</p> <p>The storm drain was so narrow that Leona Baxter's face, arms and legs were scraped raw. Squashed and drowning, she smashed into a rock in the tunnel, and was then spat into the river Wear, at Chester-le-Street, County Durham, along with her pet mastiff Brophy.</p> <p>Emergency services last night praised the girl's father Mark Baxter, a 34-year-old RAF sergeant, for \"incredibly quick thinking\" which saved her life on Sunday evening. After scrabbling vainly at the drain's displaced metal cover, he ran to the river and grabbed the child just as currents were about to carry her away. The dog did not survive.</p> <p>\"The kids had their wellies on and were really enjoying splashing around,\" he said yesterday, as fire crews warned of more rain tomorrow across most of the country. </p> <p>He and his wife Beverley, a hotel receptionist at Scotch Corner on the A1, had offered Leona, her six-year-old sister Kia and Brophy a run-around after visiting the children's great-grandparents at Chester-le-Street.</p> <p>\"I threw a stick for the dog and then I heard Bev shout \"Leona.\" I looked around for her and saw Leona wasn't there. There was nothing,\" he said. \"That's when I noticed there was a swirling whirlpool effect. </p> <p>\"I stuck my arm in but I couldn't feel anything. Then I heard Bev cry out and looked up to see the dog being sucked down the same hole.\"</p> <p>While a passerby dialed 999, Baxter thought: it's a storm drain of some kind and if it's going to spill out somewhere it would be in the river. He ran to the Wear and saw what looked like the child's coat being dragged away.</p> <p>\"I realised she was in it. She was floating face down in the river,\" he said. \"I leapt over the side and grabbed her. The water was about up to my shoulder height. She was completely still and wasn't breathing.\" </p> <p>He managed to hand the child to his wife who started first aid and Leona coughed, cried and was violently sick, spewing out water. Exhausted and with his boots waterlogged, Baxter clung on to the riverbank for the three minutes it took for a fire crew, paramedics and police to arrive.</p> <p>Firefighter Steve Hagar, who was one of the first on the scene, said: \"If there'd been a grate on the other end of the pipe or the girl had been a bit bigger she would have been stuck underground. Both she and her dad are lucky to be alive.\"</p> <p>Safety officers immediately checked other drains in Riverside Park. </p> <p>Baxter said that Leona, who is recovering in the University Hospital of North Durham, remembered most of her ordeal. He said: \"She was trying to do a star float but couldn't because she was 'squashed'. She said, 'I couldn't do them daddy because I was stuck in a tunnel'.</p> <p>\"She banged her head on a rock in the tunnel. There was no space and the force of the water knocked any swimming out. I don't know if the dog barrelled through and helped her. At the time, I didn't want to think about my daughter going through that. I just thought, 'Where will it go? It can only go to the river - it isn't designed for anything else.'\"</p> <p>Beverley said: \"I really am proud of him. We feel like the luckiest parents alive. We've still got our family.\" She said that Leona was on antibiotics and would be in hospital for a few more days, but was clearly improving. She had asked for ice-cream and chocolate.</p> <p>Rainfall of up to 30mm was predicted for today and tomorrow by the Met Office, with the worst weather likely in western areas. \"That's clearly not going to be very helpful given the large amount of rain we have already seen this month,\" said a spokesman. </p> <p>\"It's an early prediction but arguably it's angling to be one of the wettest Septembers ever.\"</p> <p>Last night 23 flood warnings were shared by the north-east and the Severn valley between Shrewsbury and Gloucester. The historic Abbey in Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, which came to symbolise last year's floods, was once again surrounded by water. </p> <p>The inquiry into Friday's devastating floods in Morpeth, where repairs are estimated at over \u00a31m, continued with claims that new defence \"pillows\", designed to absorb water and become like a sandbag, had floated uselessly away. </p> <p>The floods minister John Healey toured the town, where 1,000 properties were evacuated at the height of the floods, and said that the government was determined to help Morpeth \"get on its feet as soon as possible\".</p> <p>South Wales police promised a crackdown on thieves who have targeted elderly people following the floods. Several cases have been reported in Tonypandy and Hirwan of intruders stealing cash after gaining entry to pensioners' homes by saying that they needed to check equipment after the heavy rainfall.</p>",

  "<p>After my piece last week about Accord, the campaign against faith schools, the gentle Jesus lovers struck back. Here's an email from the US: \"I love to read the Guardian for its sneering, Christ-hating elitist attitudes. We believers kick ass for Jesus Christ, that's for sure! White hetero America-loving MALE!!!\" </p> <p>You might not expect the Catholic Herald to be ass-kicking for Jesus too - though Conrad Black is still a director. Far be it from me to define Christian values, but their latest editorial is hardly of the turn the other cheek tendency: \"Imagine the deadliest dinner party north London has to offer - Polly Toynbee, AC Grayling, Bernard Crick, Fiona Millar - all showing off like crazy as they attempt to outdo each other in moral righteousness over an organic aubergine souffle served by an underpaid Polish nanny.\" </p> <p>Let's leave God out of this. Instead, let's look at this virulent vein of personal abuse that slips like a stiletto between the ribs of ideological argument. It is class, which has become a weapon used mainly by the right against anyone on the liberal left who is middle class in order to stifle the salient issues. </p> <p>The Jesus ass-kicker calls me \"elitist\" and the Catholic Herald uses \"dinner party\" \"north London\" \"aubergine souffle\" and \"underpaid Polish nanny\" as class machine-gunfire. Never mind that I live in Lambeth and my most constant hate-swipes on Comment is Free and in rightwing political blogs is for being middle class. Indeed, I do come from a middle-class background. </p> <p>This line of attack is turned mainly on women of a similar background. Look at the loathing reserved for Harriet Harman, Shirley Williams, Margaret Hodge, Tessa Jowell, Tessa Blackstone, Fiona Mactaggart and others. They attract a rightwing spleen that middle-class male politicians escape. Neither Hilary Benn, with a millionaire mother, nor his father get it in the neck like Margaret Jay: class and misogyny fuse together in the rightwing hater.</p> <p>Rightwingers have long used class against any middle-class leftist, a bullying that sidesteps the real political argument. It implies anyone middle class is a traitor to their own by supporting fairer shares. The abuser never explains what's hypocritical about those born privileged arguing on the side of those who are not.</p> <p>It lays bare the rightwing mind set - everyone should root for themselves, and devil take the hindmost. The only authentic politics is class self-interest. Only those on low incomes are entitled to speak up for themselves - which is convenient, since almost by definition, fewer low earners have access to political platforms. If they did, they'd earn political or journalistic salaries and get the same contempt for \"hypocrisy\" - unless they were Mahatma Gandhis who gave everything away, and publicly. Exceptional saintliness seems to be the only acceptably pure position from which well-paid professionals on the left can argue that people like them should pay higher taxes. </p> <p>Labour suffered for its toff attack at the Crewe byelection, raising much discussion about whether we are still a class-ridden society. Conservatives like to protest that class in Britain is a dead duck: they would, wouldn't they, with a frontbench of Old Etonians? But if those same Old Etonians were sitting on the Labour benches, the Tories would be first to shout class abuse. This cleverly stops Labour exposing the gross self-interest of the trustafarians on the Tory benches who would, if in power, raise the inheritance tax threshold to \u00a32m. The remarkably close synergy between people who earn a lot and those who vote Tory to keep their taxes down is something pollsters can pinpoint, street by street. \"The politics of envy\" was such a cunning phrase to stop Labour attacking selfishness in the well-off. </p> <p>How adeptly the right took class out of politics to disguise the unaltering distribution of power and money. Oxford's John Goldthorpe chronicles, over decades, how little has changed. Commanding most of the media, the right constructed a \"classless Britain\" myth. New Labour colluded - Cool Britannia was a classless trope to shed its cloth-cap image. But there was nothing cool about Sunday's picture of Prince Harry's girlfriend Chelsy holding a \"chav\" fancy dress party, where royal hangers-on dressed in (very expensive) shell suits, hoop earrings and gold necklaces. What's hip about hoorays mocking their idea of the working class? The new classlessness is just the yob rich shedding all class embarrassment.</p> <p>The idea that we are all classless now drains any political identity from the 50% of all employees who earn less than \u00a323,000. Half the population has almost ceased to exist in the mirrors in which the nation sees itself, airbrushed from magazines, celeb gossip and lifestyle TV. People no longer know what others earn; even the low-paid imagine they are nearer the middle-income range than they are. Indignation at the distribution of wealth is stifled by this camouflaging of class reality. </p> <p>Scratchily angry cynicism about politics springs partly from no one honestly representing what's happening to people with middle and low incomes. Half the population has seen very little real growth in recent years, and the bottom third has suffered an absolute fall in income for five years. People feel it, yet no one says it. As Labour blathered on about high GDP growth, whose growth was that? Official figures show it was among the top 20%, and mostly the top 5%.</p> <p>By sleight of hand, Britain abandoned class politics in a still deeply class-bound society. The illusion that anyone can make it is created by fixating on a few who do - or an older generation who did in the 50s and 60s. Alan Sugar and the Beckhams are useful fig leaves - as if a room full of lottery winners were typical of lottery players. Yet class rancour breaks out frequently. Gut resentment rankles, but since Labour is silent on obscenely ostentatious wealth, there is no coherent political channel for it.</p> <p>Centrica's chief executive has just had a \u00a31m pay increase, up to \u00a34.8m, despite - or because of - this winter's 35% gas bill rise. Chelsy's chav party is a reflection of the same sod them all attitude that sees the Cable &amp; Wireless boss about to snatch a \u00a320m windfall. The right spits venom at talk of class, except to sneer at middle-class leftists, but avoids hard facts: a working-class child is 15 times less likely to move upwards than a middle-class child is to stay put. This is no classless society, but a society whose politics conspire to deny it.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:polly.toynbee@guardian\">polly.toynbee@guardian</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Wednesday September 10 2008 to correct a misspelling of Mahatma Gandhi's name.</p>",
  "<p>The current panic about Russia is a curious phenomenon. By any objective standard Russians are freer in the authoritarian state established by Putin than at any time in the Soviet Union. Many are also materially better off. Russia has abandoned global expansionism, and is now a diminished version of what it has been throughout most of its history - a Eurasian empire whose chief concern is protection from external threats. Yet western attitudes are more hostile than they were during much of the cold war, when many on the left viewed the Soviet Union, which was responsible for tens of millions of deaths, as an essentially benign regime.</p> <p>To see how this state of affairs has come about one must understand the progressive narrative - embraced nowadays as much on the right as the left - that shapes western perceptions. The Soviet collapse was a defeat for communism, a prototypical progressive ideology. There was never any prospect of post-communist Russia embracing neoliberalism, another western model. Something like Putin's Russia was always on the cards, but the return of history isn't part of the progressive script. Most of our leaders are disciples of Woodrow Wilson, with a religious faith in what Francis Fukuyama only the other day described as \"the march of history towards global democracy\". Prosperity brings bourgeoisification and liberal values, or so they believe. Russia - rich, nationalist and authoritarian - doesn't fit this progressive fairytale, and the west's reaction is a mix of threatening bluster and mounting panic.</p> <p>Nothing is more misguided than talk of a new cold war. What we are seeing is the end of the post cold war era, and a renewal of geopolitical conflicts of the sort that occurred during the late 19th century. Their minds befogged by fashionable nonsense about globalisation, western leaders believe liberal democracy is spreading unstoppably. The reality is continuing political diversity. Republics, empires, liberal and illiberal democracies, and a wide variety of authoritarian regimes will be with us for the foreseeable future. Globalisation is nothing more than the industrialisation of the planet, and increasing resource nationalism is an integral part of the process. (So is accelerating climate change, but that's another story.) As industrialisation spreads, countries that control natural resources use these resources to advance their strategic objectives. In deploying energy as a weapon Russia is not resisting globalisation but exploiting its contradictions.</p> <p>We are back to great-power politics, shifting alliances and spheres of influence. The difference is that the west is no longer in charge. With their different histories and sometimes sharply conflicting interests, Russia, China, India and the Gulf states are not going to form any kind of bloc. But it is these countries that are shaping world development at the start of the 21st century. The US - its bankrupt mortgage institutions nationalised and its gigantic war machine effectively funded by foreign borrowing - is in steep decline. With its financial system in the worst mess since the 1930s, the west's ability to shape events is dwindling by the day. Sermonising about \"law-based international relations\" is laughable after Iraq, and at bottom not much more than nostalgia for a vanished hegemony. </p> <p>Deluded about its true place in the world, the west underestimates the risks of intervening in Russia's near abroad. Russia's weaknesses - demographic decline, cronyism in the economy and a seething sense of national humiliation - are well known, but western vulnerabilities are no less real. Our leaders bore on about Russia needing us as much as we need Russia. In fact, despite a recent blip, investment in Russia is a byproduct of the global market that will continue for as long as it continues to be profitable, whereas Russian energy supplies can be curtailed at will by the Russian government. Economists will tell you the country is too reliant on oil. But the world's oil reserves are peaking while globalisation continues to advance, and Russia stands to gain from any international conflict in which supplies are disrupted. Again, the west needs Russia if the Iranian nuclear crisis is ever to be defused peacefully, and without Russian logistical cooperation Nato forces will find it even harder to bring the aimless, unwinnable war in Afghanistan to any kind of conclusion.</p> <p>Right-thinking bien-pensants in all parties believe Russia would be more amenable to western interests if only it were more truly democratic. But Putin is wildly popular precisely because he is asserting Russian power against the west; if he were more accountable to public opinion he might be harder to deal with. Democracy has numerous advantages, but it is no guarantee of a reasonable foreign policy. The current Georgian imbroglio is itself a spin-off from democratic politics. Mikheil Saakashvili's reckless incursion into South Ossetia, where Russian forces had been stationed under international agreements for 16 years, was most likely encouraged by elements in the Bush administration in the hope of damaging Obama in the run-up to the presidential election. The gambit may have worked, but the result has been a conflict that increases Russia's leverage over the flow of oil in the region and strengthens Iran in central Asia. If Dick Cheney's pledge of support for Georgia during his travels last week was a move in the Great Game it was spectacularly ill judged.</p> <p>Clearly, with the exception of some in \"old Europe\", our leaders do not know what they are doing. The grandstanding of David Miliband and David Cameron in Ukraine illustrates the point. Blathering about national self-determination and territorial integrity, they seem not to have noticed that the two principles are normally incompatible. Self-determination means secession and the break-up of states. In the Caucasus, a region of multi-sided national enmities, it means a wider war and worsening ethnic cleansing. The stakes are even higher in Ukraine. Deeply divided and with a major Russian naval base in the Crimean port of Sevastopol, the new state will surely be torn apart if an attempt is made to wrench it from Russia's sphere of influence. The country would become a battlefield, with the great powers irresistibly drawn in. Playing with Wilsonian notions of self-determination in these conditions is courting disaster.</p> <p>Let there be no mistake: Russia is, in some respects, a dangerous state. With their background in the security services, its leaders are ruthless pragmatists who will use any means to achieve their objectives. Their goal may be to roll back western influence in Russia's near abroad, but their strategy is to take whatever they can. Perceiving the west to be in decline, they are testing whether it has any coherent strategy to protect its interests. From what we have heard from our leaders, it does not.</p> <p>A start would be to shelve plans for further Nato expansion, while making it unequivocally clear that existing commitments in eastern Europe and the Baltic states will be honoured. At the same time every effort must be made to reduce Europe's dependency on Russian energy. Western leaders need to acquire a capacity for realistic thinking, or else they will be woken from their dream of progress by the force of events.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> John Gray is emeritus professor of European thought at the LSE.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>A group running TV adverts linking Barack Obama to embattled former Detroit mayor Kwame Kilpatrick has had Jerome Corsi - author of a controversial book attacking Obama - on its payroll for the past year.</p> <p>The political action committee Freedom's Defense Fund (FDF) is spending $25,000 this week to air <a href=\" http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNyZ-cbPdoM\">a TV commercial</a> in Michigan that blasts Obama for praising Kilpatrick, who resigned and headed to prison on Thursday following months of ethical scandal.</p> <p>\"Do you know who Barack Obama's friends are?\" the FDF advert asks after listing Kilpatrick's offences and playing footage of Obama calling him a \"great mayor\".</p> <p>FDF has allied itself with Corsi since last year, paying him $17,500, according to federal election records. Corsi is known for co-writing a book in 2004 that savaged the war record of John Kerry, then the Democratic presidential nominee, and penning a similar attack this year called The Obama Nation.</p> <p>FDF executive director Todd Zirkle said the group paid Corsi for writing direct-mail fundraising appeals on its behalf. FDF also gives copies of The Obama Nation to contributors who donate $44 or more.</p> <p>A litany of Corsi's anti-Obama claims have been debunked since his book was published last month, from smaller assertions about Obama's memoir to more explosive charges about the authenticity of the candidate's birth certificate.</p> <p>Obama offered the public praise for Kilpatrick featured in FDF's ad in May 2007, three months before the Detroit mayor's ethics troubles began to emerge in earnest. By September 2007, a jury had found that Kilpatrick improperly sacked two policemen who discovered that he was conducting an extramarital affair with his chief of staff. </p> <p>John McCain told Michigan TV station WXYZ yesterday that he has no knowledge of the ad linking Kilpatrick to Obama, but said he would criticise future character-based attacks on his Democratic rival \"if it's called for\". McCain has remained largely silent on the Corsi book.</p> <p>FDF is closely tied to direct-mail fundraising firm BMW Direct, which uses the same operating office in downtown Washington. Zirkle said BMW is a contractor for FDF, though the Boston Globe reported in June that BMW established FDF <a href=\" http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2008/06/29/firm_gets_big_cut_of_campaign_donations/?page=3\">\"to fund conservative campaigns and causes\"</a>.</p> <p>Corsi, who also writes for the conservative website WorldNetDaily, <a href=\" http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=56306\">reported earlier this year</a> that BMW Direct had turned down an offer to conduct direct-mail fundraising for the McCain campaign. </p> <p>As conservative groups gear up for the final two months of the campaign season, TV spots such as FDF's may be judged more on the buzz they create than on their price tag, according to political media expert Evan Tracey.</p> <p>\"Twenty-five thousand dollars in one cable system in a county is not enough for voters to see it, process it, absorb it,\" Tracey said. </p> <p>\"But if the ad gets written about, blogged about, amplified in the media - then people decide to get their chequebooks out and give the group money so they can run the ad where people will actually see it.\"</p> <p>Indeed, Zirkle said FDF plans to run future TV spots in battleground counties spotlighting Obama's relationship with former pastor reverend Jeremiah Wright, onetime anti-war activist Bill Ayers, and Kenyan opposition leader Raila Odinga.</p> <p>\"If the general public understands his background includes not more or less some of these people,\" Zirkle said, but \"everybody he's associated with who's been of this ilk - well, not everybody, but a lot of his associates in college and afterwards are of questionable character.\"</p>",
  "<p>For more than five decades I've been hiding an embarrassing family secret. But it resurfaced with a jolt as I watched the most extraordinary pair of US presidential conventions in my adult lifetime, an experience that brought home the toughest obstacle facing Barack Obama's challenge for the White House.</p> <p>It is not his youth, not inexperience, not even his race. It is the ghost of another presidential candidate from Obama's home state of Illinois \u2013 and not the national hero whom he and his campaign staff would clearly prefer to emulate, Abraham Lincoln.</p> <p>I was born in Washington DC, minutes after election day 1952, the son of parents who embodied the American dream. The children of Russian Jewish immigrants who had arrived at <a href=\"http://www.ellisisland.org/\">Ellis Island</a> with next to nothing, they had made their way through state secondaries, university, then through law school. Young, by then comfortably settled in the nation's capital, they had become deeply caught up in the 1952 election race between a respected Republican party war hero and a Democratic governor from Illinois who combined intellect, eloquence, a self-deprecating wit, and a stirring promise to \"talk sense to the American people\".</p> <p>My late mother (who would go on to work as a civil rights lawyer in the Kennedy administration) was especially transfixed by the energy and idealism of the Democratic challenger. It was she who, years later, let me in on the family secret. Had he won, she said, my parents had decided to name me \u2013 as an election-day child \u2013 in his honour: Adlai.</p> <p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adlai_Stevenson\">Adlai Ewing Stevenson II</a>'s landslide defeat in 1952, and by an only slightly narrower margin to the incumbent Eisenhower four years later, did have the virtue of having spared me hours of likely schoolyard ridicule as a boy. Yet his memory has lived on, not just in the Temko family but in the pattern of American presidential battles ever since.</p> <p>One thing, above all, sealed Stevenson's sorry electoral fate. It was the image that he was somehow too smart, too eloquent, out of touch with \"ordinary\" Americans. In different contests at different times ever since, that same rap has helped defeat a train of other Democratic candidates: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/dec/12/guardianobituaries.usa\">Eugene McCarthy</a>'s anti-war crusade in 1968, <a href=\"http://www.mcgoverncenter.com/george.htm\">George McGovern</a> in 1972, and most recently <a href\"http: www.johnkerry.com pages about \">John Kerry</a> last time around.</p> <p>America has changed profoundly since Stevenson's day (even in crashing down to defeat, he carried the then \"solidly Democratic\", and solidly segregationist, south). But many of those changes \u2013 the electoral divide between a now solidly Democratic eastern seaboard and much of the rest of the country, and the rise of evangelical politics and the profound culture clash between Democrat and Republican \u2013 has made what a leading newspaper columnist called the \"Adlai egghead\" problem more, not less, of a challenge for Barack Obama.</p> <p>Obama can still win the White House in the end. Indeed, he could win by a much more comfortable margin than the pollsters and pundits are suggesting. But only if he can find a way to exorcise the political ghost of my almost-namesake from Illinois.</p> <p>The parallels between the two democratic candidates 55 years apart are striking, and go well beyond the fact that they are both Harvard Law School graduates with political roots in the same midwestern state. Both Obama and Stevenson built their reputations on a gift for using words not only with power but beauty. Both draw their political strength, and their appeal, from conveying a sense that the presidency is about ideas and ideals as much as policies \u2013 and by calling on voters, in a time of national uncertainty and drift, to join in what Stevenson called the creation of a \"new America\".</p> <p>And both share an engaging tendency to confront electoral assaults not by striking back, but by turning the tonic of humour on themselves. When the internet bloggers began spreading the suggestion that Barack Hussein Obama was a closet Muslim, he quipped that he was a thin guy with a funny name trying to make it into the White House. When Stevenson was branded an egghead, he famously retorted: \"Eggheads of the world unite, you have nothing to lose but your yolks!\"</p> <p>Still, Obama can by now have little doubt that his \"Adlai problem\" is no laughing matter. It first surfaced months back when private remarks to supporters in San Francisco \u2013 the embodiment, for Obamasceptics, of Stevensonian elitism \u2013 were unfairly spun as condescension towards religious believers and gun owners.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/sarahpalin\">Sarah Palin</a>'s selection as the Republican vice-presidential nominee could yet prove damaging to John McCain's reputation for good judgment and his campaign's ability to knock Obama for inexperience. But in both her personal story and political credo, she embodies the modern-day image divide between Adlai and Ike. And her barnstorming acceptance speech this week, whether by instinct or design, brought that divide into ever sharper focus.</p> <p>In Stevenson's own acceptance speech at the 1952 convention, he declared:</p> <blockquote> <p>When the tumult and the shouting die, when the bands are gone and the lights are dimmed, there is the stark reality of responsibility in an hour of history haunted with those gaunt, grim spectres of strife, dissension and materialism at home; and ruthless, inscrutable and hostile power abroad \u2026 Sacrifice, patience, understanding and implacable purpose may be our lot for years to come. Let's face it. Let's talk sense to the American people. Let's tell them the truth, that there are no gains without pains, that we are now on the eve of great decisions.</p> </blockquote> <p>As Sarah Palin neared the end of her speech, with the crowd in her hands in a way it is hard to imagine any of the other mooted vice-presidential picks could have hoped for, she said: </p> <blockquote> <p>When the cloud of rhetoric has passed, when the roar of the crowd fades away, when the stadium lights go out, and those styrofoam Greek columns are hauled back to some studio lot \u2013 what exactly is our opponent's plan?</p> </blockquote> <p>\"Among politicians,\" she said, \"there is the idealism of high-flown speechmaking, in which crowds are stirringly summoned to support great things \u2026 And then there is the idealism of those leaders \u2026 who actually do great things.\"</p> <p>The nominating conventions, of course, are not the end of the campaign, but of the phoney war. Now comes the real battle \u2013 punctuated no doubt by further unexpected turns, and likely to be defined by the most important series of presidential and vice-presidential debates in memory. But for Obama, the decisive issue may not be Iraq, or universal healthcare, or energy policy. This time around, it's not even likely to be the economy, stupid. It will be all about Adlai.</p>",
  "<p>As the saying goes, all good things must come to an end. And so it must be, as tonight at 9pm I'll be liveblogging the last episode of this series of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/dragonsden/\">Dragons' Den</a>, on BBC2. Boo.</p> <p>I've quite enjoyed it, I have to say. The liveblogging most of all, obviously, but also the show - clearly it can't hold a candle to The Apprentice, but it's a decent example of the Laugh at Deluded People genre (see also X Factor and its many evil cousins).</p> <p>So join me for the final leg, as the last few contestants climb the stairs of flame-grilled doom. Don't forget to add your musings in the comment box below, and click refresh now and then for updates and new comments. Go on, you know you want to.</p> <p>So what exactly HAVE the Dragons spent their childrens' inheritance on this series? Well I'll tell you:</p> <p>light up plastic drinks glasses (novelty tat), a misfuelling prevention device (for morons), a baby buggy shopping-carrying attachment (which is probably better than I've made it sound), a fashion label called Neurotica (unmemorable), a band called Hamfatter (Indie boys from Cambridge, currently not topping the charts), a magic whiteboard (clingfilm), some toaster bags (for toasting things in your toaster), some posh cable ties (whatever), paper blinds in a box (made of paper, in a box), and some recycled jewellery boxes (courtesy of the Rehab Twins).</p> <p>Which, along with a couple of others from episode 6 that I missed, amounts to \u00a31m of Dragons' investment. Hmm. Now you look at it like that, it's not a list that's likely to set the world on fire any time soon, is it? I mean, it's not the wheel. Or the internal combustion engine. Or Sky+.</p> <p>But hey, we've had fun, have we not? And even if the final episode doesn't throw up any moments of entrepreneurial genius, at least I've been able to perv at Peter Jones for an hour. And we all know that's what really matters.</p> <p>Back at 9!</p> <p><strong>21:00:</strong> We're off! Here are the dragons. They are on the way to the den. Hello, scary dragons.</p> <p>Tonight, because it is the last episode, we have some new ideas and also an update on some from earlier in the series. The future's bright, the future's Hamfatter, says Peter Jones, kind of. I can only assume he has been at the cider.</p> <p>First up is Naomi Timperley from Manchester and her business partner Andy, who is from Pennsylvania. They want \u00a3100k for 10% of Baby Loves Disco, which is an opportunity for parents to take their kids clubbing. Because that's what's definitely missing from my nightclub experience - having my children look on as as I flail my limbs like a demented monkey on a dancefloor.</p> <p>Basically it's an organised kids' party, with organic snacks (sigh) and a DJ playing classic disco. It is already happening in 30 cities across the US, and they want to bring it to the UK. It is, without doubt, my idea of hell.</p> <p>Andy has a weak jaw and a pube beard, and his idea doesn't seem to make any money. Theo thinks it is little more than a coffee morning, but Andy has a vision for records, merchandise, sponsorship and for the 'baby loves' brand to take over the world. He says something about 'the official shoe brand of baby loves disco', and I quietly lose the will to live.</p> <p>None of the dragons can see it as a commercial opportunity. Only Deborah Meaden remains, but she never invests alone, does she? Bloody hell, she does. She's offered them the full \u00a3100k for 40% of their business. Andy respectfully declines without consulting Naomi (control freak alert) - she's clearly not happy, but Andy walks away. But he does take time to tell Peter he likes his socks. What a dick.</p> <p><strong>21:20:</strong> Next up is Simon Boyle with Beyond Boyle, a hospitality business/corporate team building affair that gets companies cooking. He also wants to get homeless people working in his restaurant, which has a definite Jamie-Oliver type feel to it. And as I recall, the project nearly broke Jamie, who's worth about a gazillion pounds. It's hard to see how it's an investable opportunity for those with tendency towards capitalist greed (naming no names here). The dragons think it's a brilliant idea, but don't invest.</p> <p>Natalie Ellis has a product called Road Refresher, which is an award-winning splash proof dog bowl. Which sounds like a brilliant idea to me, but then my kitchen floor is permanently awash with water sploshed about by Henry the chocolate lab. But hey, I love him anyway.</p> <p>She wants \u00a3120k for 15%, and does an excellent presentation - she has sold 22,000 of her doggy bowls in the last five months. She wants to expand her business into a smaller bowl and take it all to America. The technology is patented, and all is looking good.</p> <p>Hmm, it turns out she has a murky financial past, with a potentially outstanding VAT bill and a liquidated company. Deborah is concerned about her rush to take the product to the States, and thinks she's asking for too much. Peter doesn't think much of the idea either, and it turns out it's got a patent pending, rather than an actual patent. She is crashing and burning.</p> <p>Theo probes her past a bit more, and it turns out she had a mini-stroke and lost her memory. She starts to cry, and everyone squirms. How bad are Debs and Peter feeling now, huh?</p> <p>But despite this, all the dragons are out. It's been emotional.</p> <p><strong>21:34:</strong> Next up is a man with an innovative spout for a fuel can, which is terribly dull. I mean, HE thinks it's exciting, clearly, but I am uninspired. Perhaps because I do not own a petrol mower. I had not considered this to be a void in my life, but I may have to reconsider. Of course, I'll need a lawn.</p> <p>Ringtone people, rubbish idea. Bye.</p> <p>Next up is Paul Tinton, who looks like an overgrown schoolboy and warms my heart from the off by starting his presentation with 'Hello dragons!'. Bless. His company is called Prowaste Management Services, which provides a waste recycling service to the construction industry. He has wheelie bins in many different colours, which is all very worthy and useful, but I fear has limited scope for Theo to jump about in a comedic fashion. Sigh. I am bored.</p> <p>Duncan has made an offer, I'm not sure what for because I've been discussing the whereabouts of various items of PE kit with the Teenage Son. If someone has PE kit finding machine, I'd definitely buy one.</p> <p>Deborah also likes Paul's business - and is prepared to offer 20% for \u00a3100k, same as Duncan. Paul only wants to offer 33%, but after a brief and pointless wander to the back of the room, he goes for it anyway. Well done Paul.</p> <p><strong>21:50:</strong> It's time for the best bits of series 6 - the comedy, the fighting, the dragons fingering their cash. Hamfatter are making an album, but it's not really my thing. Too much drum and not enough bass.</p> <p>Ooh, I'd forgotten about the human tree! They are doing something VIP for Madonna, apparently. We're also revisting the man with the posh cable tie, which has orders for millions 'imminent'. Hmm, my torrid affair with Colin Firth is 'imminent', he just doesn't know it yet.</p> <p>Ah, the lay-line people - the sheet with the line stitched down the middle to stop couples hogging the bed. Possibly my favourite pitch of this series. Ooh, they have sold 3, apparently. Really? That many?</p> <p>Finally, a man with some kind of sculpture idea which I didn't see, so I've know idea what it's about. Anyone?</p> <p>And that's all, folks. Series 6 is over, and the final episode was a bit of a damp squib, if you ask me. A poorly-designed damp squib, with limited investment potential. But there you go - if we're looking for the silver lining, we're a week closer to the new series of The Apprentice. Cheers for joining in, the liveblog has been by far the best idea of the series, I think.</p> <p><em>Thank you all, and good night.</em></p>",
  "<p>A few spectres are haunting Brighton. Just hours ago, in a debate about whether to call the first <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1926_United_Kingdom_general_strike\">general strike</a> since 1926, the leader of the Communication Workers Union admiringly quoted Lenin. A few minutes earlier, fleshing out his vision of a mass stoppage in support of the final repeal of the Thatcher government's trade-union legislation, that reliable ultra-leftist desperado, Bob Crow, evoked the image of his members being locked up en masse in the new Wembley stadium, at the behest of an alliance of Boris Johnson and the boss class. Much to the delight of those TUC veterans whose bookshelves presumably creak under the weight of The State and Revolution, The German Ideology and the collected works of Rosa Luxemburg, old-school leftie rhetoric is more in evidence here than it has been for some time; if the ghosts of Marx and Engels made an appearance among the Brighton Centre's exhibition stands, they would surely scent the right stuff.</p> <p>And you know what? The outbreak of old-school hostilities is understandable, as this morning's debate about public-sector pay proved. Here were two intertwined stories: the last traces of many trade unionists' goodwill towards the Labour government being trodden into the dust; and proof that for all New Labour's early insistence that they could somehow erase some of society's most fundamental conflicts, the class war is alive and well \u2013 and, on the part of those waging it from the bottom end, pretty much justified (at which point, I put on my Cif flakjacket, and hope for the best).</p> <p>Before we get to the speeches about betrayal, lies and the excesses of the wealthy, some brief backstory. Despite hiked-up food and energy costs and the official rate of inflation hovering at just over 4%, the government is sticking to its 2% ceiling for public-sector pay rises, and the resultant cut in the standard of living of millions is now about to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/08/tradeunions.policy\">come and bite them</a>. Three unions \u2013 the Public and Commercial Services Union, the National Union of Teachers and the University and College Union \u2013 are set to ballot their members on strike action; 300,000 members of Unison are already pledged to walk out this winter. Two things are only enflaming the situation: the government's insistence that any increases in public-sector pay will fuel inflation, despite plenty of <a href=\"http://news.scotsman.com/letters?articleid=4388569\">evidence</a> to the contrary; and their longstanding refusal to say \u2013 let alone do - anything at all about pay restraint at the very top.</p> <p>On <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/08/tradeunions1\">Monday's </a>evidence, it's this latter factor that is decisively turning the issue toxic. In private, the odd Labour minister mulls over the idea of \"getting through the recession in a Labour way\", and demanding belt-tightening at the top as well as at the bottom, but such talk seems to amount to absolutely nothing. And so the ranks of the unions go understandably barmy. </p> <p>Delegates here talk about fretful public-sector workers on \u00a315,000 a year in the same breath as inflated executive pay and \u00a325bn's worth of tax avoidance; even the soft-spoken man from the <a href=\"http://www.csp.org.uk/\">Chartered Society of Physiotherapists</a> takes the rostrum to point up the contrast between his members' meagre wage increases and bulging \"City bonuses and shareholder dividends\". The government, meanwhile, is accused of nothing less than \"bankruptcy\" and \"betrayal\".</p> <p>To the relief of the TUC's general council, an amendment converting their promise of a big campaign into one of mass strike action was roundly defeated. The motion passed promises days of action and at least one national demonstration, though individual unions may yet join those already pledged to walkouts. </p> <p>On the back of all that, two thoughts spring to mind. First, presuming that prices remain on their current upward trajectory, isn't all this going to make the experience of any incoming Conservative government far more torrid than a lot of people have assumed (as George Osborne <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/08/georgeosborne.economy\">implicitly acknowledges</a>)? And second, though plenty of people gathered here are using the type of incendiary class rhetoric thought to have become unfashionable in around 1985, you can kind of see their point, can't you?</p>",
  "<p>Faithful to the last in their loony logic of US, President Bush and vice-president Cheney were on the warpath again last week. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2008/sep/03/bush.mccain.republican.convention\">Endorsing the presidential candidature</a> of Senator John McCain Bush declared: \"We need a president who understands the lessons of September 11, 2001: that to protect America, we must stay on the offensive, stop attacks before they happen, and not wait to be hit again.\"</p> <p>A bit of a head-scratcher that one about stopping attacks before they happen. Does it also mean we hit our enemies before they know they are our enemies?</p> <p>Vice-president Cheney, meanwhile, was touring the Caucasus and offering the kitchen sink to President Mikheil Saakashvili of Georgia as he gears up for another punch-up with Russia. But in his eagerness to go bear hunting on the edge of the Great Steppe, he seems to have forgotten the safety catch. As in his recreational <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/nolpda/ifs_news/hi/newsid_4707000/4707354.stm?\">shooting mishap</a> a few years back, it's the friends rather than the quarry that seem most at risk. Cheney appeared to be offering the Georgians a fast track to membership of Nato. Had Nato, its partner governments, and deliberative council been consulted? No \u2013 and by now a fair few of those do not think Nato is much help in lowering the tensions in eastern Europe, anyway.</p> <p>We may only have four months of the Cheshire cat grin of the 43rd president of the United States, and the Halloween pumpkin scowl of his vice president, but we are going to have live for a long time with what they have done to their country and the world. The next president will likely spend most of his term trying to clear away the debris. He will have to re-examine the strategy built from the 9/11 attacks, the operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, nuclear proliferation and Iran, China, Korea and the Caucasus. </p> <p>He can continue along the lines of the Cheney-Rumsfeld playbook of muscle-bound military might and isolationism. Or he could follow in the legacy of the great internationalist policy-makers of recent US history, Harry Truman and Acheson, Nixon and Kissinger closing Vietnam and opening to China, and George H W Bush, Brent Scowcroft and James Baker, who ensured with Gorbachev that the cold war didn't end in violence. </p> <p>From here the McCain-Palin, Obama-Biden teams did not appear particularly well placed or equipped to clear up the mess after the geopolitical Hurricanes W and Dick. It is widely believed that my former colleague Prof Samantha Power was fired from the Obama team not for being rude about Hillary, but for warning publicly that the US wouldn't get out of Iraq as quickly and easily as Barack imagined. </p> <p>If W is right, and McCain is going to follow him in using 9/11 as a licence for anything, particularly gross bad behaviour like Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo, then we are all in trouble \u2013 particularly the US allies, and not least the UK. The slavish attachment of London to Washington under Tony Blair is a continuing problem, the \"shoulder to shoulder\" and \"hug 'em close\" baloney and the folly of endorsing such a weird notion as the \"global war on terror\" included. This is the elephant in the front room of Britain's position today, a creature about whom Gordon Brown and David Miliband, his foreign secretary, seem to be in complete denial. </p> <p>The fundamental error of the fatal friendship of the Bush-Blair era was that they believed their own propaganda about US military might and the doctrine of \"full spectrum dominance\". The US has fantastic gizmos for surveillance and reconnaissance, but they are not all-powerful. A retired US colonel in charge of artillery and rocket systems procurement for the US Army told me with pride of the 'unbeatable superiority' of US forces in Iraq. He was mesmerised by a bit of kit called FBCB2 \u2013 which is rather like a souped-up Tom Tom GPS guidance navigation system in cars. \"It can tell you where every friendly vehicle is positioned,\" he marvelled. That's the problem \u2013 and why the Brits went cool on a similar system called Blue Force Tracker. As the US forces in Fallujah discovered, it tell you where the friendly forces are, almost in unnecessary detail, but it couldn't tell you where the enemy's snipers and booby traps are \u2013 and it cannot look into men's minds.</p> <p>US forces in Afghanistan seem to be facing similar problems. Despite the satellites, the Reaper and Global Hawk pilotless spy planes, the controllers \u2013 often back in the United States \u2013 cannot tell the difference between an Afghan wedding party and a shooting party. We are now getting reports every other day from Pakistan and Afghanistan of accusations of Nato \u2013 US commanded \u2013 strikes by planes and <a href=\"http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gT8vt-omKBx6L67n0qn8q00d27lw\">drones killing civilians</a>.</p> <p>In Afghanistan, as in Iraq, the UK seems to be operating more to an American operation and plan \u2013 cooked up primarily for US domestic consumption. The US is about to \"surge\" another brigade, somewhere between 5,000 and 8,000 extra troops, into Afghanistan for a renewed offensive in the borderlands with Pakistan. British and Australian special forces, as in Iraq, will be expected to help in the fray to an American plan and to American standards of behaviour. </p> <p>Before they commit to new American operations in Afghanistan, the British should reflect on the audit of all their efforts in Iraq at US behest. Already British forces are heavily committed in Helmand and Kandahar. The recent operation to get a huge new turbine to the hydro-electric station at Kijaki, involving nearly 5,000 Nato soldiers, over half British, was superbly executed \u2013 with no coalition casualties \u2013 and the new generator will bring great benefit to the people of northern Helmand.</p> <p>But for the US critics this isn't enough \u2013 the Brits and the other Europeans, say the Americans, should be trashing the poppy fields, cowing the population, beating up the Taliban and doing the often murky business of Hamid Karzai's family and pals. </p> <p>Britain will leave Iraq next year with little sense of accomplishment \u2013 some 176 dead, thousands injured and a military expenditure approaching \u00a310bn \u2013 and with very little credit and gratitude from the government in Baghdad and the principal ally, the US. \"Without adequate troops to protect the population, security in Basra deteriorated, the British withdrew and Shiite militias took control,\" was the pithy summation by John Nagl, brightest of American military thinkers, only last Friday. It took the US military and Iraqi army to get control of the city, he correctly states.</p> <p>In security at home and abroad George W Bush, Dick Cheney, Rumsfeld, Gonzales, Rove et al invoked a doctrine of exceptionalism, and executive dominance. If things continue in the same manner \u2013 and I think they will, whoever becomes the 44th president of the United States, we the allies must invoke our own exceptionalism to America's loonier foreign adventures and military demands. </p> <p>Bill Clinton's advice to Tony Blair that the best way to handle the newly elected George W Bush to \"hug him close\", must have been among the worst ever given to a British prime minister. Even an old shrewdy like William Jefferson Clinton could not have known that our Tony would take him literally and unswervingly at his word. </p> <p>If only he had taken to heart that other of the WJ Clinton bonnes pens\u00e9es, his rueful reflection, reference Monica Lewinsky, on the folly of inappropriate relationships.</p>",
  "<p>If recent displays are any guide, some might consider it a blessing. But England's crucial World Cup qualifying clash with Croatia is now highly unlikely to be shown on free to air television after a bitter row over the provision of highlights deepened today and an MP called on the government to intervene. </p> <p>The Labour MP John Grogan said the culture secretary, Andy Burnham, should bring forward a planned review of the list of protected events and, as an interim measure, make highlights of all qualifying matches involving the home nations available free to air.</p> <p>A-listed events such as the Olympics, Wimbledon, the World Cup and the FA Cup final must be shown live on free to air television while a second tier, including the Ryder Cup, home Test matches and the Commonwealth Games, are guaranteed highlights.</p> <p>Grogan accused Setanta, the Irish broadcaster that has exclusive rights to all of England's away qualifiers, of \"hoarding\" the rights to highlights. </p> <p>\"I call upon Lord Triesman, chairman of the Football Association, to make his views known. I also ask Andy Burnham to immediately put all football World Cup qualifiers in the category of listed events which, pending the review, would at least guarantee highlights coverage for football fans,\" he said. </p> <p>Setanta, which paid around \u00a35m for the exclusive live rights to the match in Zagreb, accused the BBC and ITV of refusing to pay a fair price. It has accused them of \"emotional blackmail\" in attempting to whip up a public storm to bounce it into selling the rights on the cheap. </p> <p>\"They are just being totally unfair,\" said Setanta's director of sport, Trevor East. \"We are willing to do a deal but only at a fair market value. The BBC should be bidding for England matches. But instead they go and spend \u00a350m to win Formula One from ITV and are picking off Champions League qualifiers that they should have no interest in,\" he said, a reference to the BBC's recent decision to screen Arsenal's match against FC Twente. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the free to air broadcasters accuse Setanta of placing an unrealistic value on the rights and claim it is refusing to negotiate to protect its exclusivity. </p> <p>It is looking for around \u00a31m but none of the existing bids are anywhere near half of that. In addition to the BBC and ITV, Channel 4 is also believed to have tabled a bid and been rebuffed.</p> <p>The row marks a tricky start for the FA to its new four-year broadcasting deal, won by a joint \u00a3425m bid from two of the broadcasters now engaged in a public spat. Under the deal, ITV will show competitive home matches and Setanta will air friendlies from Wembley. If one broadcaster has live rights, the other shows extended highlights. </p> <p>An FA spokesman said: \"It's very clear - none of this is within our gift. We've ensured through the contract we've negotiated that there is free to air viewing in some shape or form for all football fans. But it's not something we have control over for away matches.\" </p> <p>The rights to England's away games are negotiated on a match by match basis with the relevant football authorities. Setanta has hoovered up the rights to all of England's other away matches in its World Cup qualifying group. Saturday's clash with Andorra, also covered exclusively by Setanta, was watched by an average of 922,000 viewers. </p> <p>That was around half the number that watched Russia beat England on Sky Sports, which has a larger subscriber base, in the corresponding fixture last year, although that kicked off at 4pm on a Wednesday. Setanta will argue that the Saturday night kick off will have meant a large pub audience.</p> <p>Chants of \"We hate Setanta\" and in favour of the BBC could clearly be heard from the stands during quieter passages of play during the laboured 2-0 victory over Andorra. </p> <p>But some observers at the match believed anti-Irish sentiment among a hardcore of England fans could be as big a factor as support for the BBC, which lost the rights to England internationals in acrimonious fashion last year. </p> <p>The department of culture, media and sport said there was no chance of the review of listed events being brought forward. Burnham wants to wait for the outcome of Ofcom's public service broadcasting review, due to deliver its conclusions next spring. </p> <p>A DCMS spokeswoman said: \"Any decision on a review of listed events will be made following the outcome of Ofcom's current review of Public Service Broadcasting and work to consider broader communications issues.\"</p>",
  "<p>Republicans have always been hugely critical of affirmative action policies, believing that giving preferential treatment to women and minorities leads to the promotion of underqualified people over more qualified or experienced individuals. To them, affirmative action goes against the meritocratic nature of America. This explains why, in July, John McCain <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/election2008/2008-07-27-mccain_N.htm\">voted in support of a ban</a> led by Republican Ward Connerly that would end race- and gender-based affirmative action policies in his home state of Arizona.</p> <p>Outspoken conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh, along with other critics of Barack Obama, has repeatedly denounced Obama as an \"affirmative action candidate\", suggesting that his success is not a result of his merits but because he is African-American. In fact, only a couple of weeks ago on his radio show, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lovF-f8bkTU&amp;feature=user\">Limbaugh declared</a>: \"I think this is a classic illustration here where affirmative action has reared its ugly head. ... [The Democrats] ended up nominating and placing at the top of their ticket somebody who's not qualified, who has not earned it.\"</p> <p>It's interesting - and somewhat hypocritical - then, that the same could be said about Republican vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin. If an affirmative action policy existed for presidential and vice-presidential candidates and Obama and Palin were the beneficiaries, their respective cases would be living examples of the best and worst aspects of affirmative action.</p> <p>Sarah Palin appears to be an example of the worst kind of affirmative action, the type that Republicans typically argue against and attribute to liberal political correctness. Their promotion of this particular female candidate is more of a cynical, tokenistic gesture than evidence of any real desire to promote merit in cases where it may have gone unnoticed, or to advance the cause of underrepresented women in politics. If that was the case, there are a number of other female Republican politicians \u2013 including <a href=\"http://snowe.senate.gov/public/\">Olympia Snowe</a> and <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/~hutchison/\">Kay Bailey Hutchinson</a> - who could have been selected, and may have been better equipped for the role. It would be interesting to hear how those women feel - incorrectly used affirmative action policies often cause resentment among those feel that that they have been overlooked in favour of someone else who is clearly less able but seems to have benefited from special treatment.</p> <p>Critics of affirmative action tend to claim that engagement in the practice forces institutions or companies to lower their standards. Before McCain selected Palin, his <a href=\"http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/election/s_576734.html\">key requirements for a vice-president</a> were someone \"who can best take [his] place and carry on the agenda and the vision that [he has] outlined and will continue to outline during this campaign.\"</p> <p>Palin's convention speech last week \u2013 described by some as \"electrifying\" \u2013 did nothing to demonstrate her actual merits as a vice-presidential candidate, going by the standards set out by McCain himself. While competent and well delivered, there was little substance: no talk of her plans or proposals, her take on the economy, healthcare, national security or other issues of importance, and no agenda for getting the country out of some of its current troubling issues. There was certainly little sense that she'd be able to run America should McCain not be able to. In fact, in a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ys4HGbiONY\">CNBC interview</a> given only a month ago, when asked if she'd consider being McCain's running mate, Palin responded: \"As for that VP talk all the time, I'll tell you, I still can't answer that question until somebody answers for me what is it exactly that the VP does every day?\" </p> <p>Even some Republicans believe that Palin's political background is not up to scratch. Advisers Peggy Noonan and Mike Murphy were <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CrG8w4bb3kg\">caught off-camera </a>last week expressing their true thoughts about her. When Noonan was asked whether Palin was the most qualified woman for the job, her blunt answer was: \"No.\"</p> <p>Writing in the City Journal, conservative writer Heather McDonald provided a <a href=\"http://www.city-journal.org/printable.php?id=2763\">great analysis</a>: \"True, Palin brings traditional political strengths - such as gun enthusiasm and a pro-life record - to the ticket. Her fight against self-dealing in Alaskan politics counters the inside-the-Beltway corruption that damaged the Republicans in the 2006 elections. And her stance on drilling for Alaskan oil admirably bolsters the Republican party platform on energy issues. But admit it, fellow conservatives: none of these attributes pushed her over the top.\" I'd have to agree.</p> <p>Last week at the Democratic convention on the other hand, not only did Obama demonstrate excellent oratory skills \u2013 which some have rightly said is not in itself evidence that he could be president \u2013 but he clearly laid out policies, plans and courses of actions and displayed a firm grasp of the issues that he would have to deal with should he become president. His pick of Joe Biden as his vice-presidential running mate also displayed good judgement and discernment. </p> <p>Throughout the course of this election season, Obama has not been content to be the African-American candidate alone, but has sought to demonstrate his merits for the job. He has put in the hard graft: visiting virtually every state this year alone and meeting with foreign leaders in the Middle East, Afghanistan and Europe in order to shore up his foreign policy credentials. If he was, as Limbaugh called him, an \"affirmative action candidate\", he'd be one that demonstrates how the system should indeed work: giving positions to underrepresented people who actually work hard and prove that they qualify for it. </p> <p>The nomination of Sarah Palin is nothing more than a poor use of affirmative action in a way that the Republicans have always decried. Between now and November 4 we'll see how well this tokenism plays out.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/britishamericantobacco\">British American Tobacco</a> has become the latest UK company to face the threat of legal action in Russia, after being targeted by the country's consumer rights agency, Rospotrebnadzor.</p> <p>Gennady Onishchenko, director of Rospotrebnadzor, said this afternoon that he had signed a lawsuit against BAT for \"misleading consumers\" and infringing their rights, although he would not give any more details about the nature of the claim.</p> <p>Back in July Onishchenko launched a ferocious attack on global tobacco companies, threatening them with legal action for \"nicotine genocide\" for allegedly making huge profits at the expense of Russians' health. Today he reitereated those claims, saying the tobacco producers viewed Russia as \"an uncivilized market where they can sell dangerous and poisonous products\". </p> <p>He also accused the companies of lobbying \"barbaric norms for the amount of tar and nicotine in tobacco products\".</p> <p>BAT in London declined to comment on the attacks from Rospotrebnadzor but Alexander Lyuty, corporate and regulatory affairs director at BAT Russia, said the company have not received any official claim and, therefore, was \"not aware of its grounds in detail\". Lyuty said his company was acting \"in full accordance with Russian legislation\".</p> <p>The details of the claim remain unclear, but market watchers say the suit will likely focus on \"light\" and \"superlight\" labeling on cigarette packs.</p> <p>Rospotrebnadzor considers them misleading as consumers get the impression that light cigarettes are \"better for your health, which they are not\", Dmitry Yanin, chairman of the Consumer Societies Confederation, a non-profit group in Moscow, said after Onishchenko's July attack on the global companies.</p> <p><strong>Warnings get bigger</strong></p> <p>The Kremlin has also acknowledged that the country must do more to combat smoking. Russian has recently ratified the World Health Organization's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, which mandates a series of measures against smoking within five years, including higher prices for cigarettes.</p> <p>Russian health authorities have been pushing for curbs on tobacco producers. Health warnings on cigarette packs in Russia have been growing bigger in the past few years.</p> <p>Maxim Kulkov, head of commercial practice at Moscow-based law firm, Pepeliaev, Goltsblat and Partners, said he does not see any wrongdoing on the companies' part that could substantiate Rospotrebnadzor's claim of misleading information.</p> <p>\"The amount of nicotine is indicated on each pack,\" he said. \"The only thing they say is that the cigarettes contain less nicotine and taste lighter.\"</p> <p>Kulkov said it was unlikely the case would lead to a slew of claims, similar to the recent tobacco trials in the United States. \"Unlike in the US, in Russia it is impossible to commence a class action, a lawsuit filed on behalf of a large group of people, such as smokers,\" he said.</p> <p>The US stipulation of treble damage does not apply in Russia, which means that claimants cannot seek millions in damages, as is the case in the US.</p> <p>\"Neither BAT nor any other company on the market has broken any laws,\" said Vadim Zhelnin, director general at Tabakprom, a Russian association of tobacco producers. \"The 'light' labeling is not banned in this country.\"</p> <p>BAT has been a keen purchaser of local tobacco companies but the UK group has also found Russia a growing market for its top brands such as Dunhill.</p> <p>The regulatory broadside follows similar attacks on other Western companies in the oil and mining sectors by environmental and financial watchdogs which have usually been interpreted by analysts as attempts by the Kremlin to crackdown on the activities of foreign firms.</p> <p>Last week <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/05/bp.oilandgascompanies\">BP agreed to make wholesale changes to the management structure of its TNK-BP joint venture</a> - including the removal of its chief executive, Robert Dudley, a former BP man. Shell handed over a large share of its Sakhalin gas field business to state-owned Gazprom after being faced with destabalising criticism from a number of Russian regulators.</p> <p>The relationship between the Russian state and Western investors has also been soured by Kremlin support for military intervention in Georgia. British-Russian relations are also going through a particularly rocky period following the assassination in London of former KGB officer, Alexander Litvinenko.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Wednesday September 10 2008.

  "<p>Twelve years, eleven months and five days after he was acquitted for the double murder of his former wife and her friend, OJ Simpson's freedom hang in the judicial balance again today at the start of his trial for robbery and kidnapping.</p> <p>Simpson faces possible life imprisonment on 12 charges that arose from events last September when he challenged two dealers of sports collectors' items in a hotel in Las Vegas. He is alleged to have organised a gang of five other men and used guns to rob the dealers.</p> <p>A kidnapping conviction could carry a sentence of life in prison.</p> <p>Simpson has pleaded not guilty to all charges, and his defence will argue he was simply trying to regain possession of goods that had been stolen from him.</p> <p>As with the hugely publicised murder trial in 1995 in which he was found not guilty of the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman, despite DNA evidence that linked him to the crime, the composition of the jury will be the first important stage of the trial.</p> <p>Selection in the current case began today in a courtroom in Nevada from a pool of 250 potential members. The pool had already been reduced from 500 using a 26-page questionnaire to filter out anyone holding any biases towards the defendant.</p> <p>In an earlier hearing last November Simpson told the court: \"As always, I rely on the jury system.\"</p> <p>In the 1995 hearings, dubbed the \"trial of the century\", the defence team used an elaborate process, including an 80-page questionnaire and psychological background searches to produce a jury that largely consisted of black and only one white member.</p> <p>A year after his acquittal, Goldman took out civil proceedings against Simpson in which he was found liable for the deaths and ordered to pay $33.5m. Legal wrangles have continued to follow Simpson, who now lives in Miami, including a furore in 2006 over a book he wrote, If I Did It, which was billed as a hypothetical account of what would have happened had he committed the murders.</p> <p>Once the latest trial gets fully underway, the selected panel of 12 jurors and four reserves will hear the prosecution case that on and Ronald September 13 last year Simpson, together with five others, burst into the hotel room and robbed the sports dealers at gunpoint. Four of the five men will be giving evidence against Simpson, having struck plea bargains with prosecutors in return for a lesser sentence.</p> <p>The fifth, Clarence Stewart, is also awaiting trial.</p> <p>Simpson's main defence lawyer, Yale Galanter, will argue that the witnesses presenting against him are nefarious characters prepared to sell their testimony to the highest bidder. Galanter told Associated Press that the items Simpson recovered from the hotel room were his own.</p> <p>\"The truth is, these items were not memorabilia. The law has always provided a right, dating back to our founding fathers, to recover personal property.\"</p> <p>The process of selecting a jury could take up to a week. The prosecution will then set out its evidence in a case expected to last at least five weeks.</p>",

  "<p>Labour MP Frank Field's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/08/immigrationpolicy.eu\">new proposal</a> for \"balanced migration\" is many things, but it certainly isn't balanced. A \"one-in/one-out\" immigration policy is unfair, unnecessary and unworkable \u2013 and would deal yet another blow to Britain's faltering economy. </p> <p>Field frets that Britain's \"open door\" policy will lead to a large increase in the settled UK population, which he believes is not unsustainable. He proposes instead what amounts to a temporary-worker scheme, policed by employers. Foreigners could work here for up to four years, but would then be sent packing. Businesses that failed to produce evidence that their foreign workers had left the country would be denied future work visas. There would be a strict quota \u2013 perhaps 20,000, including dependants \u2013 on the number of non-EU workers able to gain permanent residency, selected on the basis of their skills as reflected in their salary.</p> <p>Field's proposal, cobbled together with Tory MP Nicholas Soames and the swivel-eyed xenophobes at <a href=\"http://www.migrationwatchuk.com/\">MigrationWatch</a>, is utterly misconceived. For a start, Britain does not have an \"open-door\" immigration policy: while people from within the EU can come and work here freely, those from outside the EU, which the Field-Soames proposal would target, cannot. The door is already slammed shut for all but the most highly skilled non-Europeans. </p> <p>Second, as I <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/apr/05/thecrowdedhousefallacy\">have written previously</a>, it is a fallacy that Britain's population is destined to rise inexorably. The recent increase in immigration is largely temporary, and is already reversing itself: as the pound plummets and the economy teeters on the brink of recession, Britain is far less attractive to foreign workers. But, in any case, since when are other people such a bad thing? If having more people around is so terrible, why isn't Frank Field suggesting that densely populated cities such as London, Birmingham and Glasgow prevent people from the rest of the country from settling there?<br> Even if one accepts that stabilising the population is desirable, Field's proposal would not necessarily do so. Preventing most temporary non-EU workers from settling permanently would not limit entry from the EU, or keep out asylum-seekers, clandestine migrants, visa overstayers, and those entering on family reunification visas; nor, indeed, would it prevent Britons from having more babies and living longer. Indeed, if large numbers of Britons stopped emigrating, stabilising the population would require expelling existing migrants. </p> <p>While the suggestion that employers should be able to hire the foreign employees they need has some merit, forcing most of those still here after four years to leave does not. After all, if their employers would rather they remained, these migrants are clearly contributing to the economy and society as a whole. Throwing them out would deprive Britain not only of the skills with which they arrived, but also of those they have acquired while living and working here. As an Arsenal fan, I don't want Kolo Tour\u00e9 chucked out, and I'm sure Portsmouth fans would be loath to see Kanu go, too. </p> <p>What's more, making it much harder for skilled workers to stay on is Britain is hardly conducive to attracting them in the first place. Talented people increasingly have a choice about where to work; and with Australia, Canada and other countries wooing them assiduously, making them feel unwelcome here is tantamount to shooting our hobbling economy in the foot. </p> <p>Common sense also suggests, and international experience in the US and elsewhere confirms, that businesses are hardly equipped to enforce immigration policy. At the same time, if workers would only allowed to stay in the country on their employers' say so, they would be far more vulnerable to exploitation.</p> <p>But perhaps the worst thing about the proposal is that the select few who would be allowed to settle in Britain would be the rich and the highly educated. Most likely, they would be American investment bankers and Russian billionaires rather than Asian acupuncturists or African nurses. That is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/08/immigrationpolicy.immigration\">hardly fair or progressive</a>. Frank Field should think again.<br></p>",

  "<p>The first presidential debate comes at the end of the month. From that point on, it'll be hard for either campaign to introduce much new information or frame-setting about the other.

There's no doubt that McCain's ads have been better since early July. Obama's are fine, and maybe they're reaching people in ways that we inside the Beltway can't see. But they're not very memorable, and they're not driving the media narrative the way McCain's ads have.</p> <p>The Obama people keep saying they're not going to let themselves be swift-boated, they're going to asnwer attacks, etc. That's nice, and they haven't really been swift-boated yet, but saying isn't doing.

  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> Brooklyn, NY.<br> <strong>The lineup:</strong> Chad Curlow. <br> <strong>The background:</strong> According to something we found online called The Urban Dictionary (<a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com\">www.urbandictionary.com</a>), a \"kotchy\" is \"a secret term used by middle-class, white, preppy college students who pull a lot of ass to describe a middle-class black male who is also preppy and tags a lot of white chicks \u2013 aka 'a hot white chick stealer' and 'a confused black guy'.\" So now we know. Oh, and the term originated at Kent State University in the summer of 2004 when someone was heard commenting, possibly disparagingly, \"That kotchy is wearing the same Abercrombie jeans as I am \u2026\" <br> We don't know how much ass, black or white, Chad Curlow alias Kotchy gets, or which retail outlet supplies his jeans, but we do know he's a highly-touted singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, producer and remixer from Brooklyn (via Indianapolis, Boston, Chicago, upstate NY and Pittsburgh) who is something of a buzz artist on the blogosphere. He added his trademark semi-whispered falsetto and itchy, glitchy beats to Tricky's single Council Estate, he's working with Shunda K of Domino's beastie-girl posse Yo Majesty, he's remixed Wiley, toured with acts as diverse as the Walkmen, Lady Sovereign, Spank Rock and Girl Talk (see New Band of the Day No 377) and performed with revered NY bands the Epochs and Violet alongside members of Fischerspooner, Joan as Police Woman and the Polyphonic Spree.</p> <p>With his beard and trilby he looks a bit like Scissor Sisters' studio whiz kid Babydaddy. He describes what he does on his MySpace as \"experimental hip-hop pop\" and although he doesn't particularly sound like avant-disco doyen Arthur Russell, his music will appeal to fans of same. He's a would-be R&amp;B auteur like Pharrell with the playful approach of a Prince or Beck, using a blend of electronic and acoustic instruments to bring an intelligent, deconstructive, dub-conscious focus to dance music. He reminds us that Andre 3000 of OutKast is a big fan of Squarepusher and his songs have the sticky, murky feel of current NY disco faves Hercules and Love Affair. <br> She Made It Easy is the first single from his forthcoming debut album 89 on the London-based Civil Music label. It's a fast-paced 4/4 hybrid of NYC disco and shimmery guitar that makes us think for some reason of that city's post-punk funk legends Liquid Liquid. Falling in Love is much slower and woozier but no less detailed, with what sound like oriental tones and textures and strange snippets of something filmic and orchestral that appear so briefly in the mix they serve as glitchy interference. The other track on the single is a bizarre mash-up of Bruce Springsteen and Fleetwood Mac called Bruce Fleetwood. Actually, \"mash-up\" suggests something jarring whereas this seamlessly blends the Boss at his most gritty and blue-collar authentic circa Nebraska (we can't place the track), while the Mac sample (which we can't identify either) features the transatlantic MOR gods at their most silky and synthetic. Somehow it works, not just for us but for early supporters on the net: \"It's got the kind of bassline,\" wrote one blogger, \"that feels like the soft skin of a loved one's shoulder during a long embrace.\" It should tag Kotchy a lot of ass.</p> <p><strong>The buzz:</strong> \"A sexy dancefloor number with hints of the dark side of disco.\"<br> <strong>The truth:</strong> If Tricky circa Maxinquaye had brought that stoned, sticky, murky ambience to bear on disco, it would have sounded like this.<br> <strong>Most likely to:</strong> Appeal to Lindsay Buckingham, Fleetwood Mac's secret weird-MOR weapon. <br> <strong>Least likely to:</strong> Appeal to Lindsay Lohan.<br> <strong>What to buy:</strong> She Made It Easy is released by Civil Music on October 20, followed by debut album 89 on November 24. <br> File next to: Prince, Pharrell, Beck, Hercules &amp; Love Affair.  <strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.kotchy.com\">www.kotchy.com</a> <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/kotchy89\">www.myspace.com/kotchy89</a></p> <p><strong>Tomorrow's new band:</strong> All the Saints.</p>",
  "<p>Controversial surgery for treating obesity that involves reducing the patient's stomach to the size of a thumb should be made more widely available on the NHS, according to obesity researchers. They say a lack of resources and prejudice from some doctors is preventing many morbidly obese patients from receiving life-saving surgery.</p> <p>Dr Carel Le Roux at Imperial College London and his colleague Dr Rachel Batterham are calling for 10 times the number of operations currently performed. At present around 6,000 people receive the surgery each year but guidelines from the <a href=\"http://www.nice.org.uk/CG43\">National Institute of Clinical Excellence</a> say the number should be 60,000.<br> Currently, only patients with a <a href=\"http://www.nhlbisupport.com/bmi/\">body mass index</a> of 35 or over are eligible, but the scientists say more research is needed to work out whether this criterion should be extended. A BMI of 25 or higher is considered overweight. Thirty or more is considered obese. \"We are shooting way low at the moment,\" Le Roux said. \"We actually don't have the infrastructure to look after these patients.\"</p> <p>\"What we need to know is which patients would benefit from this operation and I think that evidence is lacking,\" Le Roux told the British Association's Festival of Science in Liverpool. Around two-thirds of the UK population is overweight or obese and the World Health Organisation predicts that by 2015 2.3 billion adults worldwide will be overweight and 700 million will be obese.</p> <p>Gastric bypass surgery involves closing off part of the stomach to dramatically reduce its size and replumbing the new smaller stomach into a point further down the small intestine. Traditionally, this was seen as a crude way to reduce the ability of the patient's gut to absorb energy from food. \"Physicians had thought this was bad news for a long time,\" Le Roux said.</p> <p>But he said more recent research has found that the surgery leads to subtle long-term changes in the levels of hormones that determine how hungry and full the patient feels. \"Until that point, people actually thought these operations worked through mechanical means \u2026 and that's what patients have been told,\" Le Roux said. In many cases the surgery also cures type 2 diabetes.<br> In the long term Le Roux and Batterham hope to recreate these changes using drugs without surgery, but in the meantime they say the \u00a39,000 operation can make a huge difference to patients. It typically leads to a 25% weight reduction in the long term.<br>\"The holy grail of understanding how this works is that it will potentially lead to a cure for obesity and type 2 diabetes,\" said Batterham, who works at the centre for diabetes and endocrinology at University College London. </p> <p>She said that there is a great deal of prejudice against obese people, and solving their condition is not as simple as merely eating less and exercising more.</p> <p>\"The systems that control our weight evolved in a totally different environment,\" Batterham said. \"In the past, being able to store excess calories and being able to use that energy was actually a survival advantage.\"</p> <p>She said some people are genetically predisposed to becoming obese and once they become overweight, changes in their hormone levels mean it becomes almost impossible for them to lose weight. \"As soon as you start to diet the body thinks you are starving even though you have got lots of fat stored. What it does in response to that is it changes these gut hormones to make you feel even more hungry,\" she said.</p>",
  "<p>It's hard to reconcile Conservative party claims that the Labour government is still too cuddly with the trade unions when you step into the auditorium of the TUC congress.</p> <p>Today is day one of the four-day conference in Brighton and this afternoon unions have been debating the perennial motions about better employment and trade union rights. Gordon Brown and his fellow ministers have already said, more than once, that Labour is not prepared to go back to the 1970s, in a clear nod to the famous winter of discontent that brought the Callaghan government down and paved the way for 18 years of Tory rule.</p> <p>But talk to the unions and they will point out that they remain the most restricted and regulated organisations in the UK, which is why they are ignoring Brown's refusal to put things right and pushing through a repeat list of demands. A composite motion on employment rights outlines the unions' dismay at the government's failure to return trade union freedoms.</p> <p>The trade union freedom bill, tabled by Labour MP John McDonnell, sought to introduce better protection for workers taking industrial action from victimisation and dismissal. It also attempted to cut the red tape that sees unions hampered from taking industrial action for failing to cross every of the many \"t\"s when running ballots. The claim is that the number of technicalities that companies can cite to block industrial action skewers the democratic process. Finally, the bill also tried to introduce the right of unions to take supportive action - otherwise known as secondary action - as outsourcing becomes an increasingly popular feature of the modern workplace. </p> <p>Under current laws, if some of your colleagues are the subjects of an outsourcing exercise and see their terms and conditions drop as a result, there is nothing fellow trade unionists in the company can do about it. All the bill sought to do was maintain the workplace unity by allowing them to do so. You can see how the current state of affairs could encourage a company with strong union tendencies to outsource more and thereby weaken the workers' voice. While many in the union movement criticise the bill as mouselike in its demands, it is still too much for a 21st century Labour government to stomach.</p> <p>Brown's refusal to back the bill isn't the only gripe aired by unions today. They are also seriously concerned by a series of recent decisions made in the European court of justice that put market freedom above social and employment rights. For example, decisions have been made that have in effect outlawed the right to strike where unions are trying to win equal pay for migrant workers, and banned public bodies from requiring foreign contractors to pay such workers local rates. The ECJ's rulings mean that, while EC law protects the fundamental right to strike, action needs to be justified since it conflicts with the economic freedom of employers. </p> <p>The UK's trade unions fear employers could now exploit the uncertainty around EU law to threaten litigation in British courts, making collection action risky.</p> <p>This state of affairs has offset unions' obvious relief that the government has finally come round - at least to a large extent - on equal rights for agency and temporary workers, following a tripartite meeting with the Confederation of British Industry earlier this year. </p> <p>Unions hope that the EU agency workers' directive will finally be passed later this year under the French presidency. </p> <p>With near to 7 million members, the union movement is at just over half its heyday strength of the 1970s, and in the fevered atmosphere of a Labour leadership in trouble, union leaders are starting to warn that if Brown doesn't start to make more concessions, and soon, members might be tempted to vote Conservative. Of course, many already do, but not as many as David Cameron would like. </p> <p>His trade union envoy, Richard Balfe, will be mixing with union delegates this week, as he seeks to forge a rapprochement between trade unionists and the modern Conservative party.<br> It's unlikely that Balfe, a former Labour MEP who switched to the blue corner, will be reporting back to the Tory leader that there was much canoodling going on between trade union leaders and the prime minister when they meet up for the congress dinner tomorrow night. </p>",
  "<p>Niki Lauda has described the decision to strip Lewis Hamilton of his Belgian grand prix victory as \"the worst judgment in the history of formula one\".</p> <p>The three-times world champion criticised the sport's governing body after race stewards penalised Hamilton for gaining an advantage when he cut a corner while battling with Kimi Raikkonen. Hamilton immediately let Raikkonen back past and then re-took the lead at the next corner, but two hours after the race was hit with a 25-second penalty. This dropped him to third overall, giving Felipe Massa, Hamilton's main title rival, the victory and moving the Ferrari driver just two points behind him in the drivers' title race.</p> <p>\"This is the worst judgment in the history of F1, the most perverted judgment I have ever seen,\" said Lauda, now a grand prix commentator. \"It's absolutely unacceptable when three functionaries [stewards] influence the championship like this. Hamilton did nothing wrong. He was on the outside, he then let him [Raikkonen] by, which is the rule, and afterwards he passed him. Hamilton did the right thing in letting him by before again passing him.\"</p> <p>Lauda praised Hamilton's performance in the grand prix and criticised that of his rival Raikkonen. \"He [Hamilton] executed perfect car control when it was wet,\" said Lauda. \"He did a perfect job, won the race, and you can only take your cap off to him and congratulate him. Kimi has not done a good job this season. In this race he did a perfect job, until the end when he threw it away.\"</p> <p>Hamilton's McLaren team have until tomorrow afternoon to confirm whether they will carry out their intention to appeal the decision. There will be some debate over the matter, however, as the sport's rules say that a drive-through penalty - which in this case was converted into a 25-second penalty as it was applied after the race - is not susceptible to appeal.</p>",
  "<h2>Uganda</h2> <p>The death toll from an outbreak of <strong><a ref=\"http://www.afrol.com/articles/30649\">hepatitis E in northern Uganda</a></strong> has reached 123, following the deaths of nine more people over the past two weeks.</p> <p>According to the director for clinical services in the Ministry of Health, Kenya Mugisha, the number of people now infected is 7,757.</p> <p>The spread of the disease has been fuelled by poor sanitation at refugee camps, still home to many people in the north displaced by the Lords Resistance Army.</p> <p>The outbreak began in Kitgum district in October last year, but has spread to Gulu, Pader and Yumbe.</p> <p>The disease is spread through the consumption of food and drink contaminated with faeces.</p> <p>The government has launched a hygiene awareness campaign around internally displaced person's camps and has pledged to construct boreholes and pit latrines to help counter the problem.</p> <p>According to a report in The Monitor newspaper, 76% of diseases in Uganda are caused by poor hygiene and sanitation.</p> <p>Mugisha said if everyone disposed on human waste properly, they would not suffer from diseases like hepatitis E, cholera and dysentery.</p> <p>Some 70% of the deaths from hepatitis E have been pregnant women, according to the World Health Organisation, which is supporting the government to reduce the infection rate.</p> <p>* The country's cotton fields may be saved from pestilence thanks to a <strong><a href=\"http://allafrica.com/stories/200809040426.html\"><br>trap invented by a Ugandan scientist</a></strong>, the New Vision reports. </p> <p>Dr Ben Ssekamatte's anti-bollworm trap is made up of yellow cans opened at the sides and fixed 30mm above the crop.</p> <p>The bright cans attract the worms, which are then caught in a sticky substance made of molasses and water. </p> <p>Because the worms are attracted to the colour yellow, some farmers plant sunflowers next to cotton to direct them away from the crop. However, Ssekamatte, the director of Bio-Consult Uganda, said this method is ineffective in the long-term, as sunflowers dry up quite quickly and soon leave the cotton unprotected.</p> <p>The trap has already been tested in Zambia. </p> <p>Uganda's cotton production has fallen from one of the highest in Africa at 476,000 bales in 1969 to just 60,000 bales last year. </p> <p>* Kalangala district government, in central Uganda, has been given <strong><a href=\"http://allafrica.com/stories/200809040248.html\">12 motorbikes</a></strong> to enable healthcare workers to conduct door-to-door HIV counselling and testing in the fishing communities around Lake Victoria.</p> <p>The home-based HIV voluntary counselling and testing team will also hand our antiretrovirals in a bid to reduce the district's 30% infection rate.</p> <p>District health officer, Hillary Bitakalamire, told New Vision: \"Our work of sensitising communities about HIV/ Aids has always been limited by the lack of transportation to the various fishing communities in Kalangala and the neighbouring villages. And as a result, a number of people have contracted HIV because of ignorance.\"</p> <p>Money for the bikes, worth 35m Ugandan shillings (\u00a312,192), came from the US. </p> <h2>Improving aid</h2> <p>Developed and developing countries last week signed up to a series of reforms aimed at improving the way aid is given and spent.</p> <p>Concluding a <strong><a href=\"http://www.accrahlf.net/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/ACCRAEXT/0,,menuPK:64861886~pagePK:4705384~piPK:4705403~theSitePK:4700791,00.html\">three-day conference</a></strong> on aid effectiveness, held in Ghana, delegates from donor and recipient countries, aid agencies and financial institutions endorsed the Accra Agenda for Action. </p> <p>Under the agreement developing countries will have more control over what they do with the aid they receive, while donor countries will provide three to five-year plans of when they will be giving aid to recipients. How and when money is spent will be up to the recipient countries, which will also be free to buy goods and use services from wherever they can get the best quality at the lowest price.</p> <p>More than 800 people gathered in Accra for the 3rd High Level Forum last week to review the commitments made in the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness signed in 2005. In Paris it was agreed, in principle, to give developing countries <strong><a href=\"http://allafrica.com/stories/200809040244.html\">more control</a></strong> over the aid they receive. </p> <p>Critics have said that the <strong><a href=\"http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=80134\">unreliability of aid</a></strong> has made it hard for developing countries to take control of money or to plan ahead. More than half the money promised in donations in the last three years never materialised, the conference heard.<br> In addition to the action plan, <strong><a href=\"http://www.afrol.com/articles/30652\">the British government</a></strong> formally signed a 10-year development partnership agreement with Ghana, which will see the African nation receiving \u00a3250m in grants over the next three years. The agreement, which sees the British government increasing its aid commitment to Ghana by 20% over the next three years, was first announced in February. The Ghanaian minister of finance and economic planning, Kwadwo Baah Wiredu, said the agreement was good news for the country as it meant that 95% of the money would be untied and could be used where needed. </p> <h2>Empowering women</h2> <p> <br>Strengthening women's physical and mental health will help development efforts throughout Africa, the director of WHO Africa told the continent's health ministers.</p> <p>At a conference in Cameroon, Luis Sambo called on governments to implement action plans to <strong><a href=\"http://www.afrol.com/articles/30641\">empower women</a></strong> in their numerous roles, providing them with better education and health facilities, reported Afrol News last week.</p> <p>Sambo added that governments should fight against discrimination and practices that violate women's human rights. A \"huge majority\" of African women are still unaware of their rights to health, education and life, he added in a report, which means they continue to be \"victims\" of genital mutilation, forced marriages and early, unwanted pregnancies. These problems, along with \"weak\" healthcare systems, all contribute to sub-Saharan Africa's high rates of death in childbirth - one woman in 26 is at risk of dying during childbirth.<br> \"Women constitute a key link in the chain of development,\" he said, adding that enhancing their overall well-being would advance Africa's progress.</p>",

Photograph: RSPB</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: RSPB</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You may have noticed that oven-ready partridges have appeared in some shops just this weekend.</p> <p>The legal game seasons for England, Scotland and Wales allow the shooting of pheasant from October 1 to February 1, and partridge from September 1 to February 1. So you may have wondered how, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2008/sep/02/foodanddrink\">as reported by Jay Rayner</a>, Grosvenor House managed to serve roast partridge with wild mushrooms to the hundreds of people at the London Restaurant Awards on September 1 (not to me, guv, I wasn't invited).</p> <p>Our own supper on September 1 made me particularly alert to this mighty feat of logistics. It was my wife's formidable game pie, made from a brace each of partridge and pheasant, as we were \u2013 erm \u2013 clearing out the freezer to get ready for this year's game birds. She took advantage of a phone call from Raymond Blanc to ask him what sort of pastry to use. He said short crust, and gave her a terrific tip: cool down the filling in the freezer before putting on the pastry lid, as otherwise steam from the hot filling will make the pastry soggy. He was right on both counts.</p> <p>We live near several big shoots, which means the local shops are full of pheasant and partridge in season, and they're cheaper than chicken. Indeed, the bags are so big that sometimes they can't sell the birds and \u2013 shamefully \u2013 bury them.</p> <p>Personally, I prefer game birds to most other protein. First, because they are generally (and don't bother to write in with the exceptions, I know them all) reared naturally, with minimal chemical and pharmaceutical inputs; and second, they have a decent life before being shot - yes, I know they're nearly tame, that's one of the reasons why beaters have to be employed (I'm not bothered that they're shot for the amusement of human beings, so please don't trouble yourself to write about that, either.)</p> <p>But most important of all, they taste good. I'm not fond of game that has hung to the point of decay, though Grosvenor House-style same-day consumption is only palatable for grouse. I've twice had same-day grouse, once in Scotland, and then the other day \u2013 I think \u2013 at Quo Vadis in London. Both times the bird, though served a little too rare, actually tasted of heather.</p> <p>Grouse, however, is wildly expensive. Even this year when there are said to be good supplies, the cheapest I've heard of is \u00a39 a bird. I've just bought half a dozen wood pigeons from our butcher, and they were not cheap at \u00a31.99 each.</p> <p>At the peak of their seasons last year, though, partridges were about \u00a32 and pheasants about \u00a32.50 each, whereas a virtuously reared chicken cost a good deal more per serving.</p> <p>So why eat anything else? Do you agree? And how do you feel about hanging? Game, not people \u2013 though in American vice-presidential mooseburger-land I believe they favour both.</p>",
  "<p>You can tell quite a lot about people from their heroes. George Osborne was on Radio 4's <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/greatlives/index.shtml\">Great Lives</a> last week and, to my surprise, he chose Henry VII.</p> <p>I didn't know much about Henry VII and I had always assumed that, if the Tories had a Tudor hero, it was Elizabeth I, the prototype Thatcherite war leader, or at a pinch Henry VIII, a villain but also the first great English Eurosceptic. </p> <p>On the programme Osborne explained that he admired Henry VII because was a competent administrator. Reading Osborne's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/08/georgeosborne.conservatives\">interview in the Guardian today</a>, you can see why the shadow chancellor seems to find fiscal rectitude so admirable.</p> <p>This is how Osborne explained his choice:</p> <blockquote> <p>1485 is the date when, at the battle of Bosworth Field, Henry Tudor, who is basically an outsider, picks up the crown from the proverbial thorn bush and puts it on his head, having killed Richard III, and no one would have given him a chance of surviving as king after a long period of civil war. And yet, at the end of his reign, he becomes the first English monarch for almost 100 years to pass the monarchy on to his son, Henry VIII \u2026 I think you can say the foundations of the early English modern state are laid by this man, who probably knew less about England than any other monarch since William I of Normandy \u2026 So he's not, probably, a very likeable man, but he's the man who sorts out the finances of the crown, ends the debilitating civil war that has brought England to its knees and lays the groundwork for the magnificent Tudor dynasty of his son, Henry VIII, and then his granddaughter, Elizabeth I.</p> </blockquote> <p>Intriguingly, though, it turned out that Osborne's hero was a monumental tax raiser. The historian Steven Gunn told the programme that when Henry came to power, the crown was raising around \u00a330,000 a year. But by the time he died in 1509, annual crown revenues were well over \u00a3100,000 a year.</p> <p>Gunn explained that revenue went up partly because there was an increase in the amount of money received through custom duties; Henry did not put the actual tax rates up, but he collected more money because there was a massive increase in trade. In other words, instead of sharing the proceeds of growth, he pocketed them.</p> <p>But revenue also rose because he expanded the area of land under the king's control. Or, to put it in modern terms, he was a nationaliser \u2013 a 15th century version of Clement Attlee.</p> <p>Tories often choose Thatcher as their hero, a woman famous for rolling back the frontiers of the state. Osborne has chosen someone who rolled them forward.</p>",
  "<p>After a week when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/commentisfree+world/sarahpalin\">Sarah Palin</a> was mercilessly mocked and pilloried in sections of the American media, a more pragmatic, less dismissive assessment of her impact on the presidential race is underway. For the Democrats and Barack Obama's cheerleaders in the east coast newspapers, the initial auguries are not terribly encouraging. In short, what they see is not what middle America sees.</p> <p>The insults thrown at John McCain's Republican running mate may not be soon forgotten by white middle class people like her, in places such as southern Ohio, who could decide a tight race. \"Cosmetics saleswoman in Macy's\", \"Veep in go-go boots\", \"Shrill moose-hunting Mom\" and many similar comments revealed a surprising degree of gender and class prejudice lurking under liberal carpets. And they reinforced the \"elitist\" charge levelled at the Obama camp.</p> <p>The extraordinary depth of instant media intrusion into Palin's personal life recalled the calumnies suffered by Bill Clinton before and after his 1992 election, which Democrats then angrily condemned. Likewise much of what has been alleged so far about Palin turns out to be untrue.</p> <p>\"There were erroneous reports that Palin had supported [maverick rightwinger] Pat Buchanan's presidential bid (she supported Steve Forbes), that she had been a member of the Alaska Independence party (she hadn't), and that she had 'slashed' funding for Alaska's special needs children (she increased it),\" wrote Stephen Hayes in the <a href=\"http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/015/527qgvzw.asp\">Weekly Standard</a>.</p> <p>Following a rumour that Palin's last child, Trig, was actually her daughter's, a major US newspaper went so far as to \"demand the McCain campaign share medical records relating to Palin's amniotic fluid,\" Hayes reported. One BBC radio reporter was reduced to asking whether a parent of five children could fulfil a vice-president's duties, a question that would hardly be asked of a man.</p> <p>\"For her first five days as McCain's running mate, Palin took a shelling from the usual suspects \u2013 and some unlikely detractors \u2013 that would have disorientated the toughest veterans,\" wrote columnist Kevin Rennie in the <a href=\"http://www.courant.com/news/opinion/columnists/hc-rennie0907.artsep07,0,3493275.column\">Hartford Courant</a>. \"Her critics finally found something they wanted to drill for. Sweet crude vitriol gushed.\"</p> <p>The fact that Palin not only survived this baptism of fire but came out punching, smiling joyously, is worrying for the Democrats. Her evident toughness, her ability to work a crowd, and her unusual line (among American politicians) in sarky, sardonic put-downs are skills likely to impress in the small towns of the battleground states where the McCain campaign plans to send her.</p> <p>Palin's convention speech was watched by 37 million Americans, very nearly as many as watched Obama the week before after a six months' build-up. Her nomination has brought immediate poll dividends, with USA Today-Gallup showing <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/uselection2008/johnmccain/2704621/John-McCain-moves-ahead-of-Barack-Obama-in-latest-US-presidential-election-polls.html\">McCain-Palin ahead</a> by four points after trailing by eight. Virginia and other conservative states Obama hopes to win over report an Iraq-like surge in Republican activism.</p> <p>Recovering from their initial surprise, Democrats and their supporters are now deploying counter-arguments going beyond outright abuse. Historically vice-presidents do not decide elections, it is argued. The inexperienced Palin is afraid to debate the issues, says vice-presidential rival Joe Biden. Palin is a five-day wonder, soon to be forgotten.</p> <p>But Newsweek's <a href=\"http://blog.newsweek.com/blogs/stumper/archive/2008/09/03/fineman-palin-goes-prime-time.aspx\">Howard Fineman</a> has some cautionary words for wishful thinkers. \"Democrats dare not issue Palin a pass \u2013 she's too dangerous a foe. Normally vice-presidential candidates fade into the background. Nobody is expecting that with Palin. Indeed, her new-found celebrity has made even Obama look dull.\"</p> <p>With three Washington senators in the Democrat-Republican line-up, Palin's very ordinariness may be her biggest strength. She was ridiculed, for example, for not having a passport before visiting US troops in the Gulf last year. But the mockers forget most Americans don't have passports; that's normal. Conversely, some of Palin's wackier minority views, such as teaching creationism, hardly signify while she is bound to McCain's policy platform.<br>If the contest remains close, some Democratic strategists predict \"Wal-Mart moms\" \u2013 white, working, non-college educated women with children living in outlying suburbs and in rural parts of battleground states \u2013 may decide the outcome. Guess what? Palin is a fully paid-up Wal-Mart mom. Not only that. According to columnist William Kristol, as mayor of Wasilla, Alaska, in 1999 she presided over a wedding of two Wal-Mart associates at the local Wal-Mart. \"It was so sweet,\" Palin said. \"It was so Wasilla.\"</p> <p>To a degree not readily recognised or accepted beyond its shores or along the Atlantic seaboard, Palin is \"so middle America\". Her arrival signals a final-stretch shift in the overt focus of the election back to traditional themes \u2013 economic opportunity, security, social provision, faith, identity, character \u2013 in the traditional battlegrounds.</p> <p>For all the talk of a new mould-breaking, inclusive, post-racial politics, the cultural divide never went away. It merely fell to the shamelessly exuberant Palin to apply some northern exposure.</p>",
  "<p>Scotland should get its own digital television channel and a greater level of spending to address a significant imbalance in its share of national broadcasting, an independent inquiry has concluded.</p> <p>The Scottish Broadcasting Commission said today that the UK's broadcasters were failing to properly serve their audiences in Scotland or to spend a fair share of their money on Scottish programmes \u2013 a deficit that the industry's regulators and successive governments had also failed to address. </p> <p>Set up 13 months ago by the Scottish first minister, Alex Salmond, the commission said Scotland needed a publicly funded digital channel with its own news and current affairs programmes, and budgets large enough to commission its own drama and entertainment series, on the same lines as the Welsh-language channel S4C. </p> <p>The BBC should also substantially speed up its pledge to spend 8.6% of its programming budget in Scotland, in line with its population, by delivering on this target by 2012. The corporation should also base one of its four television channels, such as BBC3 or BBC4, in Scotland, the SBC recommended.</p> <p>But in a blow to Salmond, the commission failed to support his long-held demands for a Scotland-only evening news programme to replace BBC1's main evening TV bulletin \u2013 an \"opt out\" programme known as the \"Scottish Six\" \u2013 among its 22 recommendations.</p> <p>Blair Jenkins, the commission's chairman and a former head of news and current affairs with BBC Scotland, said the proposed digital channel would have its own evening news bulletin and insisted it was up to the corporation to decide how best to serve its audience across the UK.</p> <p>The commission, which includes the former Tory and Labour ministers Lord Fraser and Henry McLeish as its members, deliberately distanced itself from demands for a \"Scottish Six\" \u2013 something that Scottish nationalists and some industry figures have championed for more than 10 years \u2013 and from Salmond's support for independence.</p> <p>They said the Scottish parliament should have greater oversight of broadcasting in Scotland, but rejected calls for control to be devolved entirely to Holyrood. The commission also said broadcasting needed to be studied \"with fresh eyes, in an open-minded and non-partisan way. Broadcasting should not serve as a surrogate for the constitutional debate in Scotland.\"</p> <p>Even so, Salmond welcomed the commission's report, stating: \"It represents nothing less than a blueprint for a revolution in Scottish broadcasting, containing a range of very positive and exciting proposals.</p> <p>\"The report is a major challenge to the Westminster government and the broadcasters themselves to step up to the plate \u2013 there can no longer be any possible excuse for inaction.\"</p> <p>Jenkins, who resigned from BBC Scotland in 2006, reputedly in protest at the director general Mark Thompson's spending cuts, suggested the new \"Scottish Network\" would need between \u00a350m and \u00a375m in direct public funding \u2013 S4C receives \u00a395m. He said the channel would revitalise the Scottish independent sector and rejuvenate programme-making. That would spin off into better programmes for the major networks and would enrich the cultural life of Scotland and the UK.</p> <p>\"It will meet the clear demand from people in Scotland for a greater volume and range of Scottish programmes; and it will help to fulfil the economic, cultural and democratic imperatives of Scottish broadcasting. The Scottish Network is the missing piece in the UK's jigsaw of public service broadcasting,\" Jenkins added.</p> <p>\"We believe the new network should have a clear and distinctive public service remit \u2013 to be entertaining and informative, obviously: but also to be ambitious, challenging, risk-taking, contemporary, outward-looking, bold, original and intelligent.\"</p> <p>With speculation growing that the industry regulator, Ofcom, will allow ITV to either entirely drop or heavily reduce its news and current affairs output by relaxing or scrapping its public service obligations, Jenkins said there were concerns that the Scottish channel 3 broadcaster STV would also cut its local news coverage. </p> <p>If this happened, a Scottish digital channel would be crucial to ensure the BBC had competition and that Scotland's needs as a country were properly met. \"It's the missing piece in British public services broadcasting,\" he added.</p> <p>The proposed new channel was welcomed by STV's chief executive, Rob Woodward, who has campaigned for a dedicated Scottish digital channel run by his company with BBC involvement and had briefed the commission on its proposals. </p> <p>But Woodward's estimates suggest the channel could run for about \u00a320m, with \u00a315m from public funds and a further \u00a35m from advertising. \"The quantum of public funding being mooted by the commission is rather ambitious, particularly in the current climate, but we're supportive of finding ways to make it happen,\" he said. </p> <p>Under STV's proposals to run the channel as part of its stable, it could be cross-promoted and have a stronger link to the main network broadcasters. </p> <p>\"It's important that the channel isn't an orphan channel and is associated with an existing channel, which is one of the reasons why we're keen to be involved,\" Woodward added. </p> <p>A spokesman for BBC Scotland rebuffed the commission's demands for Thompson's 8.6% spending target to be introduced four years early, arguing that the corporation's finances were too uncertain. </p> <p>The BBC said it was already making significant strides to address its non-London output, particularly at its new digital production centre at Pacific Quay in Glasgow. </p> <p>\"The BBC is already embarking on an ambitious structural change but there is also a licence fee settlement planned for 2012 so the details of funding arrangements after that date remain unclear. </p> <p>\"Care has to be taken so that, as far as possible, centres such as Pacific Quay become significant and sustainable production hubs - not just for the BBC but for the associated creative industries. This is not about quick fixes or hitting quotas for the sake of it. </p> <p>\"It's important the BBC plays its part in developing mature markets for the creative industries outwith London. We look forward to working with all interested parties in ensure network production from Scotland is increased on a sustainable basis.\"</p> <p>The new Gaelic digital channel, BBC Alba, which will be launched by Thompson next week, is running with funding of just under \u00a315m, including \u00a310m from the BBC. </p> <p>Many observers believe the commission's inquiry, which has lead to three interim reports and involved dozens of evidence sessions with senior broadcasters, has already forced the BBC to better address its relationship with the UK's \"nations and regions\" and increase spending in Scotland. </p> <p>Late last year, Thompson pledged that the corporation would spend at least \u00a350m a year more on programme-making in Scotland within a decade.<br> The commission's recommendations include: <br><strong>\u00b7</strong> A new digital channel, publicly funded from any new public service broadcasting obligation, including a strong online element with special content<br><strong>\u00b7</strong> Ofcom should require STV to maintain its news and current affairs, and non-new Scottish content, in a new public service settlement<br><strong>\u00b7</strong> The BBC Trust should ensure all the corporation's news and current affairs better reflects the UK's nations and regions<br><strong>\u00b7</strong> All the main TV networks should improve their coverage and commissioning in a way \"relevant\" to them<br><strong>\u00b7</strong> Channel 4 should be forced to increase its spending in Scotland to 8.6% as a condition of its public funding and also base one of its commissioning departments in Scotland<br><strong>\u00b7</strong> The remit and funding of BBC Radio Scotland should be improved \"in light of its unique national status\"<br><strong>\u00b7</strong> Scottish ministers and the Scottish parliament should have greater oversight and responsibility for broadcasting, \"within a UK framework\"<br><strong>\u00b7</strong> Ofcom should have a Scottish board member</p> <p><em><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857.

  "<p>After eight years of inaction, carbon emissions policy may finally take a reality-based turn. Both Republican senator John McCain and Democratic senator Barack Obama have proposed \"cap-and-trade\" (CAT) plans. While McCain's running mate, Alaska governor Sarah Palin, recently declared she <a href=\"http://www.newsmax.com/headlines/sarah_palin_vp/2008/08/29/126139.html\">doesn't believe climate change is \"man-made\"</a>, I'll assume that McCain continues to support his plan.</p> <p>There are two key differences between the candidates' plans. First, by 2050, Obama would <a href=\"http://my.barackobama.com/page/content/newenergy\">reduce emissions by 80%</a> of 1990 levels. McCain <a href=\"http://www.johnmccain.com/informing/issues/65bd0fbe-737b-4851-a7e7-d9a37cb278db.htm\">stops at 60%</a>. Second, Obama would use a market-based auction to allocate permits that power CAT policy, while McCain would simply give them to polluters, providing huge annual handouts to a favoured few at everyone else's expense. Let's see why.</p> <p>When you burn fossil fuels, emitted carbon harms the environment for everyone around you. Because you don't bear the costs you impose on others, they're \"external\", and this is known as a negative externality. Economists have known for eons that with negative externalities, leaving a market alone - \"free-market\" policy - causes inefficiency in the form of too much pollution. The only way to avoid this outcome is some sort of government intervention. Period.</p> <p>Under old-style \"command-and-control\" regulations, the government told polluters how much to emit, and that was that. Pollution stays below the desired level, but this policy is inefficient, since some companies can reduce their carbon footprints more cheaply than others, and all that matters is the total amount emitted. An alternative policy doesn't restrict emissions, but imposes a per-pound tax on emitted carbon. Producers that can reduce emissions for less than the tax will do so, while others will produce carbon and pay the tax. In principle, the tax can be set to achieve any desired level of emissions reduction. </p> <p>But the government might screw up. Too high a tax brings unnecessarily high reductions in economic production. Given today's tax-phobic political climate, it's more likely that the government would set the tax too low, with disastrous climatic results.</p> <p>Enter cap-and-trade. Government chooses the total quantity of carbon emissions (cap) and issues permits that companies can buy and sell (trade). Once permits are allocated, supply and demand determine the price of a permit, which acts just like a carbon tax: companies that can reduce emissions cheaply will sell permits and reduce emissions, while companies on the opposite side of the ledger will buy permits and keep emitting carbon. The lower the cap, the higher the price. CAT provides the benefits of both command-and-control and taxes: emissions won't top the cap, and the \"right\" companies will do the reduction.</p> <p>Research suggests those permits will be worth real money - perhaps as much as $<a href=\"http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/money_co/2008/08/obama-energy-pl.html\">50-$300bn per year by 2020</a>. That's enough money to pay for an awful lot of campaign promises.</p> <p>Obama would <a href=\"http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/05/the_case_for_auctions.php\">auction off the permits</a>, using the proceeds for taxpayer rebates and investments in green energy sources to help offset CAT-induced increases in production costs, which themselves will lead to reduced employment and higher prices. Basic fairness and common sense suggest that whatever pain CAT causes should be salved with shared benefits.</p> <p>By contrast, McCain's plan fails this fairness test. While average taxpayers adjust to higher prices due to higher production costs, McCain would shower <a href=\"http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2008_05/013715.php\">windfall profits on polluters' shareholders</a>. As noted above, CAT is just like imposing a tax, together with a clever mechanism to ensure the chosen reduction in total emissions. Refusing to auction off the permits, though, is just like letting polluters keep the revenue from a carbon tax. Would anyone support that?</p> <p>Now, it's true that CAT will increase polluters' costs, reducing shareholder value. But we could compensate shareholders with just 15% of the permits' value - a far cry from McCain's 100% gift.</p> <p>Let's leave aside the fact that McCain would reduce emissions by considerably less than Obama. The simple fact is that McCain's plan would provide the mother of all handouts, for no good reason. An annual giveaway of hundreds of billions of dollars to polluters - just because they are polluters - is most certainly not the change anyone should believe in.</p> <p><em>[Note: due to an editing error, the second sentence of the second paragraph previously read \"...reduce emissions to 80% of 1990 levels\". It should have read: \"...reduce emissions <strong>by</strong> 80% of 1990 levels\". Apologies.]</em></p>",

  "<p><br>'The logical conclusion of soundbite culture' ... Jeremy Kyle on the set of his show. Photograph: Christopher Thomond</p> <p>Carole Cadwalladr's foray <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/sep/07/itv.television\">behind the scenes of The Jeremy Kyle Show</a> left her shocked and it's not hard to see why. She reports how unmedicated borderline schizophrenic Jamie was placed before the baying Kyle audience as his disastrous private life was laid out before them. \"I was totally stitched up\" he tells her. Suffering from bipolar disorder and exhibiting schizophrenic symptoms, it's not surprising Jamie thought his girlfriend was cheating on him. But the show is not interested in such complexities. It is the logical conclusion of soundbite culture - if you can't reduce a problem down to a platitude, nobody is interested.</p> <p>But Kyle has always played by his own rules. Philosopher <a href=\"http://www.michel-foucault.com/concepts/index.html\">Michel Foucault</a> wrote how techniques perfected in the penal system are implemented in wider society forming what he called a \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carceral_state\">carceral archipelago</a>\". Something similar happens on The Jeremy Kyle Show where techniques perfected in law enforcement (lie-detector tests, DNA tests, interrogation) are brought to bear on the feckless and sexually incontinent. For in his fiefdom, Jeremy Kyle is the law. \"It's my name on the stage, not yours\" he tells his congregation. This is <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyw0RpiJWoE&amp;feature=related\">his own personal Jonestown</a>.</p> <p>You can watch the Jeremy Kyle show, roll your eyes, be appalled or choke on your cornflakes but it's a very strong will that can switch off when there's a lie-detector revelation right after the break. It's compelling penny-dreadful theatre with a simple but effective problem-condemnation-resolution narrative.</p> <p>Kyle brilliantly exploits the subtle divisions between the British working class - the decent, hard-working salt-of-the-earths versus the sponging criminal underclass. It's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikfkcBgaUzA\">Jim Royle</a> versus <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-O9Bhukq7U\">Frank Gallagher</a>. That's a war that's been going on long before Kyle came on the scene.</p> <p>And this is what we need to take on board: Jeremy Kyle did not amble down from the hills one day, club in hand like a fairytale troll, looking to debase our culture. He fulfilled a need. Just like drug-dealers, pornographers and journalists he gave us what we wanted. We are totally complicit - he's a monster of our own creation.</p> <p>But that doesn't mean that we should be subject to him. It's been a fun ride but placing the mentally ill before the braying masses is not how we do things anymore. We created him, now we can destroy him. Between 9.25 and 10:30am, ITV should be a no-go zone. Sorry Jeremy, that's all we've got time for.</p>",

  "<p>The French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, arrived in Moscow today as part of a European Union delegation hoping to persuade Russia to honour its pledge to withdraw troops from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/georgia\">Georgia</a>.</p> <p>As Sarkozy arrived in the capital, a Russian foreign ministry spokesman set a tough tone for the talks, saying that Moscow opposed an independent EU monitoring mission in Georgia.</p> <p>Andrei Nesterenko said the deployment of an EU monitoring force would lead to unnecessary \"fragmentation\" of international monitoring efforts by the UN and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe.</p> <p>Sarkozy's primary mission will be to persuade the Russian president, Dmitry Medvedev, to pull his forces out of Georgia.</p> <p>The EU delegation, which includes the European Commission president, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, and the EU foreign policy chief, Javier Solana, will also push for a quick deployment of several hundred EU monitors to Georgia.</p> <p>However, there was little sign that Russia intends to comply with the EU's demands. Nearly a month after a truce negotiated by Sarkozy ended a five-day war, Russian troops remain entrenched deep inside Georgian territory.</p> <p>Earlier today, Russian soldiers turned back a UN convoy from a tense zone around the breakaway province of South Ossetia in a blunt demonstration of who is in charge.</p> <p>The convoy of four vehicles from UN agencies waited for about an hour at the checkpoint in Karaleti, but was turned away after a brief discussion with a Russian general.</p> <p>David Carden, who is leading the interagency mission by the World Food Programme, Unicef and the UN refugee agency, said the teams were attempting to do a preliminary humanitarian assessment and would try again.</p> <p>After talks in Moscow, Sarkozy and the EU delegation will travel to the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, to meet the president, Mikheil Saakashvili.</p> <p>Sarkozy has been criticised for giving the Russians too much room for interpretation in the peace deal, which was signed on August 12. His diplomatic blitz to Moscow and Tbilisi is seen by some as a last chance to save it - as well as his own credibility as a peacemaker.</p> <p>Georgia and the west have accused Russia of failing to honour its pledge to withdraw troops to positions held before the fighting broke out. Russia says those troops are peacekeepers and are therefore allowed under the accord to help maintain security around Georgia's breakaway provinces, South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Moscow has recognised the two regions as independent states.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Georgia has opened a new legal front in its battle with Russia for control of the regions, going to the International Court of Justice in The Hague over claims of Russian human rights abuses in the two provinces. It wants the court to impose emergency measures to halt killings and forced expulsions.</p> <p>Tina Burjaliani, Georgia's first deputy minister of justice, told the court today that Russian forces, local militias and mercenaries were conducting a campaign of murder, forced displacement and attacks on towns and villages that started in the early 1990s and culminated in last month's brief war.</p> <p>The court is the UN's highest judicial body. Its rulings are binding, but it has no enforcement powers.</p>",
  "<p>I first met Omar, a final year student at <a href=\"http://www.birzeit.edu/\">Birzeit University</a> near Ramallah, in the summer of 2007. I was taking part in their Palestinian and Arabic studies programme for international students. Omar was their chief volunteer. He was particularly helpful to me when, in his own time and without payment, he helped me by arranging and translating interviews with young Palestinians. Without his kindness, I could not have completed my research.</p> <p>In the early hours of March 27 2008 Omar was arrested at his family home by the Israel Defence Forces. Since being taken into custody he has been transported across territorial borders from the West Bank to Mascobia detention centre in West Jerusalem (contravening the <a href=\"http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/385ec082b509e76c41256739003e636d/6756482d86146898c125641e004aa3c5\">fourth Geneva convention</a>), and was denied access to his family or legal counsel. Omar's detention was then extended several times and access to legal counsel was systematically impeded. On May 1, Omar was formally placed under administrative detention and charged with throwing stones on an unspecified date between 2001 and 2002. The charges do not make reference to any specific incident making it impossible to defend against them. They also refer to Omar as an adult, even though he would have only been 16 at the time.</p> <p>Omar managed eventually to contact the right to education campaign at Birzeit. His <a href=\"http://right2edu.birzeit.edu/news/article546\">full statement</a> is available on their website. With the campaign's permission I include a short extract here:</p> <blockquote> <p>I saw soldiers beating other inmates and fear that I could be next. I'm also very disoriented, I hear sounds of dogs barking and people screaming at night. I think these are recordings but they affect me ... I have no idea how long I will be in prison. I have no idea what they are doing or claiming. All I know is that I'm not a threat to security but I was still being questioned about all sorts of things, so anything and everything is going through their heads. I basically just want to know when I can see my family again.</p> </blockquote> <p>Omar has since been moved to a prison in the Negev, inside Israel. His family have again been denied visitation rights. His case has not been to trial and neither he nor his lawyer has been shown evidence.</p> <p>Omar's case is nothing unusual. Over 80 other students from Birzeit University are similarly incarcerated, 35 have not faced trial. In the last 5 years, nearly 350 students studying there have served time in prison. Widespread arrest and detention is only one example of the occupation forces' systematic attack on education in the occupied territories, and Birzeit is only one hundreds of schools, colleges and universities under occupation. The use of checkpoints, the separation barrier, arbitrary curfews, rigidly controlled resources and even extra-judicial killings are all measures which cause extensive and critical damage to academia at all levels.</p> <p>A book by the Defence for Children International's Palestine section in 2004, <a href=\"http://www.dci-pal.org/english/publ/Display.cfm?DocId=190&amp;CategoryId=8\">Stolen Youth</a>, documents the route for detainees though the distinct system of law operating in the West Bank which governs matters between Israeli settlers, the military and secret services, and Palestinians. Prisoners are subjected to poor conditions, malnourishment and torture. Access to family, medical attention and legal counsel are restricted arbitrarily. Furthermore legal procedures in military courts are so biased that many Palestinian lawyers can only really supply psychological counsel for their clients rather than any effective defence. </p> <p>Omar's incarceration is based on secret evidence from the Israeli general security services which was shown to a military judge. The law provides that he may be held for up to six months, on a renewable basis (in violation of the international covenant on civil and political rights). </p> <p>Omar's health is suffering because of poor conditions, ill-treatment, psychological stress and solitary confinement, but his case is not the worst nor the most emotive story of Palestinian prisoners under the Israeli occupation. However, it highlights the absurdity of the occupation particularly in relation to the peace process. It is too easy simply to regurgitate the old leftwing argument that if Israel treated Palestinians a little better this would eliminate all threats to the state. The situation is vastly more complex than that. But, unquestionably, a viable, independent and prosperous future for any prospective \"state of Palestine\" is the key to a lasting peace. </p> <p>The Omar I knew before his detention was an extremely intelligent, charismatic, and generous young man. He bore scars of the occupation, like all Palestinians, but held no specific ill-will against Israelis, Jews or Judaism. Omar speaks fluent English (with an infectious Californian accent) and was not driven by any religious sectarianism. He was profoundly committed to his family, his education and working towards a better standard of living and greater access to justice for his peers. Despite the oppression of Israel's occupation, he had retained the ambition to contribute to the wellbeing and stability of any future Palestinian state.</p> <p>It is impossible to fully appreciate Omar's experiences inside Israel's prisons. And I don't know if, or how much, they will have changed him. My profound hope is that he is strong enough to remain someone still with everything to live for, no matter what the future holds for the Palestinian national project. However, Omar's treatment has opened my eyes to the pressures undergone by a new generation of Palestinians which, regrettably, gives them yet another reason to fight Israel. It also provides another reason for peoples all across the region to believe that the celebrated doctrine of human rights is reserved for the west and its allies and for no one else.</p>",

  "<p>A trade association representing the biggest advertisers in the US has sent a letter to anti-trust regulators opposing the online search advertising deal between Google and Yahoo.</p> <p>The letter, from the Association of National Advertisers, argues that the alliance will see Google/Yahoo control 90% of search advertising inventory in the US.</p> <p>Bob Liodice, the president and chief executive of the ANA, said <a href=\"http://www.ana.net/news/content/1388\">the letter</a> \"states ANA's concerns that the partnership will likely diminish competition, increase concentration of market power, limit choices currently available and potentially raise prices to advertisers for high quality, affordable search advertising\".</p> <p>The ANA, which represents advertising heavyweights such as Procter &amp; Gamble and General Motors, added that it had sent the letter after conducting a \"comprehensive independent analysis which included input from the board's members and face-to-face discussions with Google and Yahoo\".</p> <p>The letter was sent to Thomas Barnett, the assistant attorney general of the US Department of Justice, and will feed into a wider competition investigation into the Google/Yahoo deal.</p> <p>The Google/Yahoo deal gives the search engine giant the right to sell search and other text ads on the internet content company's sites in a revenue share deal.

  "<h2>What is happening?</h2> <p>Britain's biggest building society, Nationwide, is to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/sep/08/banks.mergersandacquisitions\">take over the Derbyshire and Cheshire building societies</a>, the UK's 9th and 11th largest societies respectively. The deal for the Derbyshire will be concluded on December 1, and around a month later for the Cheshire. </p> <h2>Why are these societies being absorbed?</h2> <p>The official line is that these are \"prudent and pre-emptive actions\". In plain English this means Nationwide has stepped in to prop up the smaller societies. They have been hit hard both by the credit crunch, which has restricted their access to money market funds, and arrears on sub-prime lending, buy-to-let and other lower quality lending.</p> <p>Derbyshire bought in poor quality loans, causing the same problems that almost derailed Bradford &amp; Bingley, while Cheshire made a \u00a310m loan to a property developer, which is unlikely to be repaid in full. </p> <h2>What will the Derbyshire and Cheshire customers get?</h2> <p>Absolutely nothing - other than the comfort factor of having the Nationwide with \u00a3179bn in assets give financial backing to the Derbyshire, with \u00a37.1bn, and the Cheshire with \u00a34.9bn.</p> <p>There will be no bonus payments for savers or borrowers or any other form of cash handout to members - unlike <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2007/aug/28/business.currentaccounts\">last year's takeover of the Portman</a> by Nationwide, which produced payments of up to \u00a31,000 for qualifying borrowers and savers.</p> <h2>Will the Cheshire and Derbyshire disappear?</h2> <p>No. Unlike the Portman merger, where Portman branches shut down overnight or converted to Nationwide branding, both the Derbyshire and Cheshire will retain their names and branch networks - Nationwide says this will continue indefinitely as there are no plans to integrate the two smaller organisations. It will be business as usual with the same staff at the same locations. </p> <h2>What happens to my savings account?</h2> <p>If you have an account with the Derbyshire or Cheshire, existing passbooks and other arrangements will remain. But over time it is likely that rates on offer will become more aligned to those available from Nationwide. </p> <p>If you have savings worth more than \u00a335,000 with the combined societies, you may want to switch some of your money to a different savings provider, as only the first \u00a335,000 will be covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.</p> <h2>What happens to my mortgage?</h2> <p>You will continue to repay your mortgage as agreed under your existing deal. Over time the Nationwide intends to align rates at the two societies with its own - good news for borrowers as the Nationwide offers cheaper loans. </p> <p>Those people with loans in arrears and other problem mortgages could see changes, as Nationwide will take over key areas such as debt management and repossession policy. The Derbyshire has 2.7% of its loan book more than three months in arrears - Nationwide is only looking at 0.36% of its lending in trouble.</p> <h2>Will Nationwide customers notice the change?</h2> <p>No. There are no current plans to merge computer systems so customers will not be able to use Derbyshire or Cheshire branches. The merger only increases the overall assets of Nationwide by some 7%.</p> <h2>Do members have a say in this?</h2> <p>No. This is a done deal with no scope for discussion. There will be no member vote or member meeting as there is no potential member bonus. Derbyshire and Cheshire members will receive a merger notification statement outlining the details, but this is a legal formality, which will merely set out that while ultimate control will move to Nationwide in Swindon, nothing else will change in practice. Members (and other interested parties) have the legal right to raise concerns with the Financial Services Authority (FSA), although in practice this is nothing more than a formality.</p> <h2>Will there be job losses?</h2> <p>Both Derbyshire and Cheshire will retain their present head offices, which will become operational centres. But there may be some job losses in the headquarters of the two societies as some roles will be absorbed by Nationwide headquarters in Swindon.</p> <h2>Was this expected?</h2> <p>Yes and no. While the two deals were kept firmly under wraps until now, it has been widely rumoured that watchdog the FSA has been acting behind the scenes to ensure the smaller societies could continue in business - the regulator does not want another Northern Rock style run with queues of savers in the street. </p> <p>There was a run on the Derbyshire in the early 1970s when local major employer Rolls-Royce hit financial trouble, which ended when other societies moved in to bolster its balance sheet.</p>",
  "<p>It's a funny old business when a Republican administration espousing small government and unfettered capital markets has to nationalise the country's two biggest mortgage companies to the tune of at least $200bn (\u00a3113bn). The US treasury secretary preferred the more legalese term of \"conservatorship\".</p> <p>Even the red-in-tooth-and-claw Wall Street Journal <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122083060663308415.html?mod=hpp_us_whats_news\">had to concede</a> that with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac it had no choice. But you can hear the grinding of teeth when it reports the US mortgage crisis entering a <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122079276849707821.html?mod=hpp_us_whats_news\">new and uncharted phase</a>, potentially saddling American taxpayers with billions of dollars in losses from home loans made by the private sector.</p> <p>You could hear the pain in John McCain's voice as he spoke at a rally in Albuquerque: \"We need to keep people in their homes, but we can't allow this to turn into a bailout of Wall Street speculators.\" Barak Obama, who received $1.6m in contributions from the two companies in the current election cycle, according to the Centre for Responsive Politics, took a similar line. As the Journal <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2008/09/06/fannie-and-freddie-enter-the-presidential-race/\">blogged</a>: </p> <blockquote> <p>Neither wants to appear to be supporting a bailout for corporate interests at a time when job losses and foreclosures are mounting across the country</p> </blockquote> <p>In the UK where, post-Northern Rock, bank bailouts are not such a surprising thing, the Fannie and Freddie rescue is still reported as \"dramatic\" news with the Financial Times and the Telegraph agreeing that it was the \"<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?MLC=/money/city_news/article&amp;xml=/money/2008/09/07/cnfreddie207.xml\">world's biggest financial bailout</a>\".</p> <p>The FT spelt out the <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3a4cb13a-7d04-11dd-8d59-000077b07658.html\">uncomfortable truth</a> that the two Fs had been taken under state control.</p> <p>\"British mortgage specialists welcomed the move, saying it should inject some confidence into the housing market, which is suffering its steepest price fall since the 1930s,\" the Telegraph reported, specifically pointing out that this was a nationalistion. A mortgage broker is quoted: \"This is effectively the US doing a Northern Rock - nationalising part of its mortgage market. If the US government is guaranteeing the bonds, it should allow companies, including UK investors, to feel more confident.\"</p> <p>The Times <a href=\"http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/banking_and_finance/article4697785.ece\">agrees</a>: \"The US government's decision \u2026 is good news for British banks and, in turn, British homeowners.\" It quotes McCain telling CBS that Fannie and Freddie had become \"sprawling, massive bureaucracies, rife with corruption and cronyism\".</p> <p>But it takes <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/07/business/07bailout.html?ref=business\">Nelson D Schwartz</a> in the New York Times to put all this into perspective:</p> <blockquote> <p>Despite decades of free-market rhetoric from Republican and Democratic lawmakers, Washington has a long history of providing financial help to the private sector when the economic or political risk of a corporate collapse appeared too high. The effort to save Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is only the latest in a series of financial manoeuvres by the government that stretch back to the rescue of the military contractor Lockheed Aircraft Corporation and the Penn Central Railroad under President Richard M Nixon, the shoring up of Chrysler in the waning days of the Carter administration and the salvage of the savings and loan system in the late 1980s.</p> </blockquote>",
  "<p>American politicians love rock'n'roll anthems for their election campaigns \u2013 they just never seem to ask permission before using them. The rock band Heart have lashed out against the Republican party after their song Barracuda was used twice to introduce vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin. \"I think it's completely unfair to be so misrepresented,\" singer Nancy Wilson told Entertainment Weekly. \"I feel completely fucked over.\"</p> <p>While Republican presidential candidate John McCain doesn't exactly strike the same poses as Tony Blair did, his campaign has continued the trend of using pop music to bolster its image. While at one time rock music was a symbol of hedonism and protest, today it communicates energy, youthfulness and cool. And that is something that 72-year-old McCain's party, in particular, can use.</p> <p>They just didn't bother asking first.</p> <p>The problem started last Thursday, when Alaskan governor Sarah Palin took the stage at the Republican National Convention. Heart's 70s hit Barracuda rang out from the speakers \u2013 a nod to Palin's feisty reputation and to her high-school basketball-team nickname. </p> <p>Republican officials had not asked Heart, Universal Music Publishing or Sony BMG whether they could use the song \u2013 and, in a statement, Heart insisted that even if asked, they would never have offered permission. McCain campaign officials were unapologetic. \"Prior to using Barracuda at any events, we paid for and obtained all necessary licences,\" spokesman Brian Rogers told Reuters. Under US copyright law, public performance of the song is licensed under a blanket fee paid by the Minneapolis venue.</p> <p>But Heart weren't having any of it. \"We have asked the Republican campaign publicly not to use our music,\" sister singers Ann and Nancy Wilson said in their statement. \"We hope our wishes will be honoured.\"</p> <p>They weren't. Later that evening the song was used again, as Governor Palin joined John McCain on the arena stage. The Wilsons were incensed. \"Sarah Palin's views and values in NO WAY represent us as American women,\" they wrote in an email to Entertainment Weekly. \"We ask that our song Barracuda no longer be used to promote her image.\"</p> <p>\"[Barracuda] was written in the late 70s as a scathing rant against the soulless, corporate nature of the music business, particularly for women ... There's irony in Republican strategists' choice to make use of it there.\"</p> <p>They then sent a cease-and-desist order to Palin, insisting that she stop using their song. </p> <p>The Wilsons are not alone in their frustration with the McCain/Palin soundtrack. Artists John Mellencamp, Boston and Jackson Browne have all complained about the Republicans' use of their songs over the course of this year's campaign. Browne even took legal action last month, suing the McCain campaign for their use of his 1977 hit Running on Empty in an ad attacking Democratic candidate Barack Obama.</p> <p>There's at least one man, however, who is singing a different tune. Another of Barracuda's songwriters, former Heart guitarist Roger Fisher, said that although he supports Obama, he was \"thrilled\" with Palin's use of the tune, calling it an \"ingenious placement of a kick-ass song\". </p> <p>Something tells us that Fisher won't be soon joining the Heart reunion tour. </p>",
  "<p>If Gordon Brown were not Heathcliff, but an attractive woman (hard to imagine, I know) he'd be called a tease. He looks at us coquettishly with come-hitherish \"there's-going-to-be-an-election\" eyes. Politicians, journalists, the country perk up and get ready for an election. \"Oh, no, actually, there's not,\" says Brown at the last minute, when our hopes have been roused. </p> <p>Now he puckers up on winter fuel payments and a windfall tax for large companies \u2013 everybody gears up to oppose or rejoice and fix their budgets - before Brown dances about and retracts. \"Only teasing,\" he winks. </p> <p>No one likes to be led up the garden path, to the top of the hill and down again \u2013 that puts everybody's back up, whether they are friend or foe. What does Brown think he's doing? Actually, I don't think Brown's really got it in him to tease. It looks painfully like he's simply desperately out of control.</p> <p><strong>Small schools rule, ok? </strong></p> <p>This week, thousands of children went back to school. For many, this week will be one of the most challenging weeks of their life so far, as they make the huge leap from the nest of primary school to the jungle of secondary \"big\" school. </p> <p>Where once all the teachers knew their name, and they knew all the children in their year, they will be met by staff who don't know them from Adam, and a year group perhaps three times the size of the one they are used to. </p> <p>The results of the social challenge of getting to grips with \"big school\" can be seen in the classroom. Alarmingly, <a href=\"http://www.conservatives.com/tile.do?def=campaigns.display.page&amp;obj_id=136162\">research has shown that eleven-year-olds who take the same key stage two maths test a year later do 10% worse</a>.</p> <p>It can also be seen in behaviour problems. 47% of pupils play truant for the first time after entering secondary school. Headteacher after headteacher will tell you how invaluable it is to preside over a school small enough that they can know every child's name. A sense of anonymity fuels a sense of license to misbehave. If the teacher doesn't know your name as you run away across the playground, you can't get into trouble. That's not theory. That's fact. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2008/jan/03/schools.uk\">In schools of over 1000 pupils, exclusion rates triple</a>. </p> <p>(And worryingly, the number of schools with over 2,000 pupils has also tripled since Labour came to power.)</p> <p>So you would think that the case for small schools, as advocated by groups like <a href=\"http://www.hse.org.uk/\">Human Scale</a>, was a no-brainer, and that councils up and down the country would be seizing on this to reform their beleaguered community schools. You would think. But my local council in Bristol, which has one of the lowest rates of educational achievement in the country, and (bar London boroughs) boasts the highest rate in the country of children leaving the local authority to go to schools outside the council's control (at over a staggering 20%), has decided that the answer to school reform is to make schools bigger. </p> <p>The city's \"primary strategy\" is looking at amalgamating several primary schools, creating bigger primaries. It also looking to close down some primaries (some popular and not undersubscribed) in order to improve the rate of surplus places which is costing the city dear. </p> <p>\"That's all very well,\" you might say. \"The council must save money.\" That much is true. But it will leave bigger schools, which are unlikely to be much better than the ones it replaced, which local parents chose to shun. It is a short-term structural fix that risks making the core problem worse \u2013 the schools have empty places because parents don't want their children to go there. </p> <p>Bristol city council has one thing right in all this, though - in the furore of the debates about secondary schools, the vital importance of primary schools often gets lost. A child's brain is at its most absorbent in the first few years up to the age of around eight. GCSEs and A-levels may direct a child's life chances, but those chances are often forged or lost much earlier \u2013 at primary school, learning to read, write, reason and use numbers. </p> <p>Alleviating the transition from small school to big school should not mean making the small schools bigger. Making the big schools smaller, and improving primary schools by concentrating on teacher quality, freedom and sufficient finance in a structure of strong accountability \u2013 as measures such as creating academies aim to do for secondary schools \u2013 provide the long-term answers, both for local authorities aiming to improve their place on the education league tables, and for children at the most important stage in their life.</p>",

He announced emergency funding for the councils worst affected by the floods.</p> <p>He is due to meet leaders of the insurance industry later this week to discuss how it will deal with the many claims. </p> <p>The Association of British Insurers said initial estimates suggested damage claims would run into the \"low tens of millions\".</p> <p>The flood damage was compounded in South Wales by thieves who talked their way into older peoples' homes after posing as water company officials.</p> <p>Cash was stolen from the home of an 85-year-old man in Tonypandy after he let in a man who said he needed to check the taps. A similar incident involving a 92-year-old woman took place in nearby Hirwaun.</p> <p>Forecasters predicted further rain tonight and tomorrow. The number of official flood warnings has been cut from 100 yesterday to 40 today. Most of the flood warnings are in the north-east, although there are no longer any severe warnings there.</p> <p>There are eight floods warnings in the Midlands relating to the rivers Wye, Trent, Leam and Severn. The Environment Agency has issued one flood warning for the Anglia region, relating to the rivers Ouse and Ouzel at Newport Pagnell.</p> <p>The agency said a prolonged drenching from slow-moving storm clouds gave the north-east a month's rain - up to 140mm - in a few hours on Saturday.</p> <p>Computer models gave several hours' warning to the stricken area, as new rain gauges sent electronic signals to the Environment Agency's regional headquarters.</p> <p>Asghar Akhoudi, an agency forecaster, said that buckets in the gauges were tipping and refilling in quick succession as the downpour approached, transmitting data each time. Rain levels were such that traditional fill-and-check gauges would probably have been overwhelmed.</p> <p>The leader of Castle Morpeth council, Peter Jackson, said: \"The last major flooding in Morpeth happened in 1963 and we have extended our defences since then.\"</p> <p>The Environment Agency consulted with the Morpeth area when flood fears were voiced last summer. An agency statement in December warned that the town's defences \"need to be improved and extended to cope with today's level of flood risk and our changing climate\".</p>",
  "<p>Empowerment is a difficult word to define. It is used widely and probably too easily by donor agencies, governments and NGOs to describe a number of different approaches and strategies towards development.</p> <p>Yet at the heart of all empowerment strategies lies the basic concept of giving people or communities the power to control their lives and claim their rights.</p> <p>In Uganda empowering all citizens to play an active role in the country's economic and social recovery is a pillar of its <strong><a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/NP/prsp/2000/Uga/01\">Poverty Eradication Action Plan</a></strong> and is at the heart of the country's wider decentralisation agenda.</p> <p>After decades of centralised single-party and military dictatorships left the country's productive capacity destroyed and its economy in tatters, Uganda has now developed a democratic multi-tier system of local government, which has seen power and administrative control of some state functions such as education and local governance decentralised from the centre out to the regions.</p> <p>The participation of local communities in the rebuilding and reshaping of their own public services such as education, sanitation and health is seen to be essential to the success of this strategy. Local democracy means that communities now vote-in their own local leaders and government officials, who are then theoretically accountable to the people who put them in power (instead of to central government agendas).</p> <p>But while Uganda is starting to enjoy a blossoming international reputation as a country where a new governance framework has the potential to enable and encourage universal participation at every level of society, success in translating empowerment from the page to the ground has been patchy.</p> <p>This is particularly true in northern Uganda, which was wracked by conflict throughout the violent rule of Idi Amin and his successor Milton Obote. By the time the Lord's Resistance Army reached Katine in 2003 and inflicted terror on the entire sub-region, northern Uganda had weathered over three decades of political and military instability.</p> <p>Poverty, illiteracy and a lack of the most basic services are just some of the legacies left behind. While the Ugandan economy sees a steady economic growth rate of around 6% a year, nearly 70% of people living in rural northern Uganda survive on less than one US dollar a day.</p> <p>The people of Katine continue to be among the poorest in the country, and some of the least likely to benefit from development budgets and initiatives. Despite the government's progress in rebuilding the economy, many villages in Katine lack the most basic services and facilities.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-337348232\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/online/2008/02/19/Katine-farmers-groups-vote.jpg\" alt=\"Katine farmers groups vote\" width=\"220\" height=\"280\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Locals voting at a meeting of the Emorikikinosi farmers group. Photograph: Richard M Kavuma</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard M Kavuma/guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Involving people in local government and decision-making processes continues to be undermined by the fact that elections at all levels in Uganda are usually characterised by contestants paying their way into power. And although the governance structure for universal participation is now in place, development budgets are still largely controlled at the top of the power chain.</p> <p>The dissemination of information, key to any real participation in local decision-making processes, is also being curtailed by mass illiteracy. Over 30% of all adults and over 50% of Ugandan women still can't read or write. Contact with the news media is also limited, with most Ugandan women having no access to a radio. The government providing access to information is one thing, if people can't reach or understand it then what's the point?</p> <p>But perhaps the biggest challenge the empowerment agenda faces is the sense of powerlessness still felt in the dusty villages of rural Uganda.</p> <p>For people who for decades have been relentlessly driven off their land, had their cattle stolen and lost family members to successive insurgent groups, the idea that they have any power at all must require a leap of the imagination.</p> <p>According to Amref, the recognition by local people that they have basic rights to healthcare, education, shelter and food \u2013 and the fact that the government has an obligation to deliver on these rights \u2013 is key to real and transformational empowerment from the ground up.</p> <p>Communities who understand that they have a basic right to health can start questioning why it is undermined by a lack of food, medicine or healthcare services. A village which believes its children have a right to universal education can start asking why schools aren't being built, girls continue to be excluded or promised teachers and textbooks fail to materialise.</p> <p>The causes of poverty \u2013 such as exclusion, unfair allocation of resources and marginalisation \u2013 can begin to be questioned, symptoms recognised and local state players and officials held truly accountable.</p> <p>In Katine, groups such as Amref and Farm-Africa are trying to break down these barriers by drawing on the resources of the community to mobilise and participate from the ground up.</p> <p>The Katine Community Partnerships Project has formed village health teams (VHTs) and Water/Sanitation committees that meet every week to discuss the needs of their villages.</p> <p>Committees like the VHTs are made up of volunteers from villages across Katine sub-county, who work with Amref to disseminate information and mobilise and organise locals to identify gaps in provision in their own community as well as across the region.</p> <p>Training recently given to all 132 members of VHTs across Katine's six sub-counties helped develop capacity for local people to gather accurate sanitation and hygiene data from across the region and then feed this into wider regional strategies for sanitation services.</p> <p>In this way it is hoped that empowerment initiatives like VHTs will grow to become fully integrated into the communities they serve and that the status and respect accorded to volunteers who run them will encourage others to take part.</p> <p>Real community empowerment has the potential to bring transformational change to a country that is doing its best to recover from years of instability and bloodshed. But at the end of the day it will only work if every single Ugandan gets the chance to play a part in shaping the future of what is still a fragile state.</p>",
  "<p>Just when Thailand's beleaguered prime minister thought things could not get any worse, he found himself in court today defending his popular cooking show.</p> <p>Samak Sundaravej, the irascible rightwinger and passionate foodie, spent an hour in the witness box dismissing accusations that his extra-curricular activities violate the constitution.</p> <p>The constitutional court is due to make its ruling tomorrow, and if it finds Samak guilty the 73-year-old who took office at the head of a six-party coalition seven months ago could be forced to resign.</p> <p>Samak has declared a state of emergency in Bangkok where clashes between government supporters and opponents left one man dead and dozens injured.</p> <p>More than 5,000 anti-government demonstrators from the People's Alliance for Democracy have been camped in the grounds of Samak's offices for nearly two weeks, accusing him of corruption and demanding he quit.</p> <p>The protesters have turned the elegant grounds of the heart of the Thai government into a scene that resembles a carnival, with a constant diet of music and political speeches. Samak and his ministers have been barred from entering their offices.</p> <p>The cooking show, Tasting, Grumbling, a mix of tips on traditional Thai cooking and rants on subjects of his choosing, represents the most immediate threat to his power.</p> <p>Samak had hosted the show for several years before he became prime minister, though it went off the air after the government appointed by the leaders of the 2006 coup closed down the state broadcaster.</p> <p>On taking office Samak hosted several of the shows after the channel was resurrected, finally stepping down two months into the job.</p> <p>Senators accused Samak of breaching the constitution by working for a private company while he is prime minister and filed a petition.</p> <p>In court today, Samak said he was not employed by the television company but received a small fee and the cost of his transportation to the studio.</p> <p>\"I was hired to appear on the programme and got paid from time to time,\" he said. \"I was not an employee of the company, so I did not violate the law. I presented the cooking show and got paid for my acting.\"</p> <p>The managing director of the company that produced the programmes, Sakchai Khaewwaneesakul, testified that Samak was paid 80,000 baht (\u00a31,250) for four shows.</p> <p>\"The presenters of our show are not our employees,\" he said. \"But we pay them honorariums.\"</p> <p>Samak was indicted by an independent watchdog, the national counter-corrupt commission, which forwarded the allegation to the constitutional court.</p> <p>If the court disqualifies Samak from office, it could defuse much of the political tension that has beset Thailand for months. \"By making a quick decision, the court will help a lot in resolving the political crisis,\" said Suwat Apaipakdi, a lawyer for the senators who lodged the petition. </p> <p>\"If the court rules that prime minister Samak is disqualified from holding office, then he political crisis could automatically cease.\"</p> <p>The election commission ruled last week that Samak's People's Power party had committed electoral fraud and should be disbanded, a case also expected to end up before the constitutional court.</p>",
  "<p>The new research by the Poppy Project, <a href=\"http://www.eaves4women.co.uk/News/News.php\">Big Brothel</a>, a survey of the off-street sex industry in Lodon, has generated shock and <a href=\"http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/UK-News/Prostitutes-In-London-Sex-Being-Sold-For-As-Little-As-15-Ponds-According-To-Eaves-Poppy-Project/Article/200809115093265?f=rss\">headlines</a> that sex can be purchased in London for as little as \u00a315 and highlighted the fact that sex without condoms is available. </p> <p>However, closer inspection of the data reveals that only 2% of brothels contacted by phone by researchers offer sex without condoms. This leaves a very impressive 98% of establishments insisting on condom use. Many brothels charge for the amount of time a customer spends with a sex worker and the \u00a315 fee quoted does not specify whether or not this is for a 10- or 15-minute appointment. Certainly, according to the research, the average fee is more than \u00a360, with some charging up to \u00a3250 for sex. The survey found no concrete evidence of girls under 18 working in brothels \u2013 the average age was 21.</p> <p>The research states that there is an absolute minimum of 1,933 women working in London brothels. This figure is likely to be inaccurate. The researchers have not allowed for the fact that many women work in different flats on different days of the week, so many of the same women may have been double, triple or even quadruple counted. It is also common for one woman to advertise using several different names, with several different phone numbers, so again Poppy may well have over-counted the subjects of their research.</p> <p>The government-funded Poppy Project has views on prostitution that chime with those of key government figures such as Harriet Harman, Denis MacShane and Fiona Mactaggart. They oppose prostitution in general, not just trafficking. The Poppy report was released at the same time as a government poll on prostitution, that found that 58% of men and women would support making it illegal to pay for sex if it helped reduce the number of women and children trafficked into the UK for prostitution.</p> <p>The government and the Poppy Project conflate the horrors of trafficking with prostitution in general. Yet the scenario of a woman being forced into prostitution, treated abysmally and denied access to her earnings is very different from that of a woman who works in one of the establishments surveyed by Poppy of her own free will, chooses her clients and working hours, insists on condom use and earns \u00a31,000-\u00a31,500 per week. Many women in the latter situation would prefer not to be selling sex but cannot find other \"unskilled\", flexible work which pays at the same rate.</p> <p>Those who are ideologically opposed to prostitution in all its manifestations may not like the fact that tens of thousands of women working in the industry have made a choice to take up sex work because of the money they can earn. Nonetheless this is the reality. These women who work in flats and saunas are not addicted to Class A drugs \u2013 indoor establishments do not generally tolerate such addictions.</p> <p>The government poll asks if people are prepared to criminalise the buyers of sex (from all sex workers, not just those who are trafficked) in order to protect the most exploited. But evidence from the recent police and Home Office joint operation \u2013 Pentameter Two \u2013 a comprehensive and intelligence-led sweep of brothels across the land, netted only double figures of suspected trafficking victims. Denis MacShane has quoted a figure of 25,000 trafficked women and children in this country. Where are the others? Either the police are doing a lousy job at flushing them out or more likely, they're not here in the numbers quoted.</p> <p>The government is conducting a review and is considering <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/sep/04/harrietharman.labour\">criminalising men who pay for sex</a>. It is vital that before any decision is made, there is an honest debate about the entire spectrum of prostitution in which facts are presented, stripped of the ideological spin that has obscured them in recent years. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/03/humantrafficking.childprotection\">Victims of trafficking</a> need all available help to get out of prostitution. On the basis of the evidence provided by operations like Pentameter 2 they are a minority of those involved in prostitution rather than the norm.</p> <p>Before the government implements a ban, they should consider carefully that whatever laws they pass, women who have made a choice to sell sex to earn a living rather than to support a drug habit, or because they have been coerced into it, are likely to continue to do so. If men are criminalised for buying sex, the women selling it will be driven underground, making them more vulnerable to violence, with less control over what they do. For a government that has pledged to protect women in prostitution from exploitation, this could be a spectacular own goal.</p>",
  "<p>Hong Kong's pro-democracy politicians have confounded predictions by holding on to their veto power on major laws, despite losing three seats in yesterday's legislative elections.</p> <p>Many people had expected the democratic parties to suffer badly at the four-yearly polls, with surveys indicating growing Chinese patriotism and a growing focus on economic concerns rather than political freedoms.</p> <p>Instead, democrats claimed 23 of 60 seats on the legislative council, making gains in the 30 directly-elected seats. The other half are chosen by special interest groups such as business people, who tend to vote for pro-Beijing candidates.</p> <p>Only around 45% of registered voters took part - the second-lowest turnout since the former British colony returned to Chinese hands in 1997.</p> <p>Hong Kong's \"one country, two systems\" agreement offers greater political and economic freedoms and describes universal suffrage as its \"ultimate aim\". Beijing last year took heat out of the democracy debate by saying that the territory could elect its own leader from 2017 and all of its legislators from 2020, at the earliest. At present the chief executive is elected by a committee dominated by pro-Beijing figures.</p> <p>Pro-democracy candidates said last night's results sent an important message to the mainland.</p> <p>\"Hong Kong people still have the aspiration for full democracy,\" said Alan Leong, a member of the opposition Civic party who was re-elected. \"Those in power can't afford to ignore it.\"</p> <p>Tsang Yok-sing of the pro-Beijing Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong acknowledged: \"It is short of our expectation. We'll seriously review what we did wrong.\"</p> <p>The 2004 vote coincided with widespread anger at the territory's Beijing-picked chief executive - subsequently ousted - and proposed national security legislation.</p> <p>Professor David Zweig of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology said people had continued to vote for the pan-democratic camp at a much higher level than anticipated this time.</p> <p>\"Overall, people want both democracy and a good relationship with the mainland. The Civic party did better than the Democratic party because they aren't seen as opponents [of Beijing],\" he said.</p> <p>\"People feel more positive about the mainland. You have the Olympics and surveys showing people see themselves as Chinese as much as Hong Kong.\"<br>Political analyst Ma Ngok of Chinese University said the democrats' performance in directly elected seats might boost their bargaining power with the government.</p> <p>About 1.52 million people, or about 45% of registered voters, cast ballots yesterday, compared to 56% in 2004.</p> <p>Dr Lam Wai-man of the University of Hong Kong, an expert on political participation in the territory, blamed depressed turnout on the lack of pressing political issues and voters' boredom with wrangling within and between parties.</p> <p>She added: \"Some people don't think their political platforms are so different apart from on the pace of democratisation. Their social and economic policies are very similar.\"</p>",
  "<p>No \"short-term gimmicks\", <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/sep/05/gordonbrown.economy\">Gordon Brown promised last week</a>. So, Ed Stourton asked on the Today programme this morning, what on earth was he doing hauling ministers up to Birmingham for what Downing Street is billing as the first meeting of the cabinet outside London (or Chequers) since 1921?</p> <p>As Adam Boulton pointed out on Sky this morning, perhaps the decision has something to do with the fact that the West Midlands is chock-full of marginal seats, that David Cameron brought the shadow cabinet here, and that the Tories are coming back to the city later this month for their annual conference.</p> <p>\"This is Gordon Brown trying to say that Labour cares,\" said Boulton, in a live report from Birmingham.</p> <p>A few minutes later Ed Miliband was on the Today programme to say that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/sep/08/labour.edmiliband\">it wasn't a gimmick</a>, and that he didn't even expect it to win Labour any new votes. He just said it was good practice for cabinet ministers to find out what's going on outside London.</p> <p>Miliband has a point; this does seem to be a genuine fact-finding trip. Before the formal cabinet meeting, ministers are taking part in at least nine separate visits. There will also be a series of roundtable discussions, involving more than 200 members of the public.</p> <p>The cabinet meets at 1.30pm, at the international convention centre. And afterwards there will be a \"civic cabinet meeting\" (whatever that is), at 3.30pm, at which a regional economic statement will be launched.</p> <p>I'll be updated this blog throughout the day as we learn more. I'm afraid I'm in London. But Mike White's in Birmingham, and he'll filling me in as the day unfolds.</p> <p><strong>11am</strong> </p> <p>Geoff Hoon has just been interviewed arriving for the event at the ICC. He seems to be in a jolly mood. He says that he's had a relaxed morning because he didn't have to get up early for the trip to London (his constituency is in the region) - so that explains it.</p> <p>He is also asked about Gordon Brown's decision to make a reference to the personal adversities he has suffered in his statement to the Labour party ahead of the annual conference. \"I think it is quite right that Gordon should talk about the challenges that he has faced in his own life,\" says Hoon. </p> <p>Reading <a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/article1660429.ece\">some of the reports in today's papers</a>, you could be forgiven for thinking that Brown had spoken explicitly about the tragedies he has suffered in his life. But, if he read <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/sep/08/labour.gordonbrown\">the actual text</a>, you will see that in fact there is only one oblique reference to the \"great challenges\" he has faced in his life. If any of Brown's advisers are hoping to persuade him to \"open up\" more, they clearly have a long way to go.</p> <p><strong>12.15pm</strong> </p> <p>I've just been on the phone to Mike, who spent the morning with David Miliband at the Right Start Foundation in Small Heath. It's an organisation that promotes inter-faith understanding. Apparently it was a good meeting, with a productive exchange of views, although it does sounds as if the logistics of ferrying 20-odd cabinet ministers around Birmingham with security etc will have made this quite a pricey outing.</p> <p>But they did not splash out on first-class rail fares, it seems. Nick Robinson was travelling on the train up to Birmingham with David Cameron (for a Panorama programme - Robinson doesn't explain why they were off to Brum) and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/nickrobinson/\">on his blog</a> Robinson describes a cabinet minister brushing past them on his way to slum it in second class.</p> <p>A Twitter feed from Downing Street tells me that Brown has launched the government's manufacturing strategy. You can read more about it <a href=\"http://www.berr.gov.uk/sectors/manufacturing/strategyreview2008/page45271.html\">here</a>.</p> <p><strong>1.15pm</strong> </p> <p>I've been reading some of the things ministers have been saying in Birmingham on the news agency wires. James Purnell, the work and pensions secretary, said his visit to a children's centre had been an \"incredibly enthusing\" experience. \"You design policies in Whitehall and you don't actually know they work unless you talk to people affected by them,\" he told the Press Association. You know what he meant, but he could have expressed it more delicately.</p> <p>But I think the significant comments may turn out to be the expressions of loyalty. Asked about the prime minister's position, David Miliband said: \"I think Gordon is leading us with more vigour and determination and will prove people wrong ... I am absolutely convinced that Gordon can lead us to victory. He has enormous values, drive and vision.\" </p> <p>This doesn't sound like someone who's about to launch a coup. Media commentators like <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/sep/08/pressandpublishing.rupertmurdoch?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=politics\">Peter Wilby</a> and <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/media/2008/08/johnson-codes-david\">Brian Cathcart</a> have been having a go at lobby correspondents recently for over-interpreting comments made by politicians. But, at the risk of winding them up, I wonder - is there something significant about that \"more\" in \"more vigour and determination\"? Has Miliband persuaded himself that he was all set to launch a leadership bid but that, now Brown has raised his game, he doesn't need to?</p> <p><strong>3pm</strong></p> <p>Downing Street has just put <a href=\"http://www.number10.gov.uk/Page16764\">this up on its website</a> under the headline \"Top image - Birmingham ICC\" .</p> <p>Is this really the best picture they can get? It makes Brown look like an undertaker.</p> <p>I've just seen him looking much more animated on TV doing a quick clip about Andy Murray. There's obviously something about the prospect of a Scotsman defying expectations that cheers him up.</p> <p><strong>4.15pm</strong></p> <p>The Tories have emailed me a \"background briefing note on how Birmingham has been failed by the Labour government\". It's full of highly selective statistics about all the bad things going on the city (ie \"in one part of Sparkbrook over 80% of people are income deprived\" etc etc). I sometimes wonder why parties bother with this stuff, because it never makes the papers. But what it does do is convey the impression to journalists (who don't even need to read the document in full) that the party producing it is ferociously well-organised. Labour used to do exactly the same before 1997.</p> <p>I haven't had the email Brown has sent to Labour party members. But Iain Dale has, and you can read it <a href=\"http://www.iaindale.blogspot.com/\">on his blog</a>. He points out that Brown specifically eschews rhetoric, only to conclude with the line: \"Fairness is my purpose, my pride, my principle.\"</p> <p>I haven't seen much from Birmingham on Sky or News 24 recently. They were both interviewing \"locals\" earlier and the coverage gave the impression that the inhabitants of Birmingham were underwhelmed to find their city making constitutional history. Mike will be writing about the event in the paper tomorrow. I suspect some of the newspaper coverage will be pretty hostile (even now there is probably some unfortunate tabloid reporter under orders to put a price tag on the whole shindig) but Brown has managed to contrive a show of loyalty, and talking to voters looks better than not talking to them, so my guess is that ministers will be reasonably content with the way it's worked out.</p> <p>That's it. Thanks.</p>",
  "<p>On Thursday the London mayor <a href=\"http://www.london.gov.uk/view_press_release.jsp?releaseid=18677\">announced</a> a package of fare rises and the same day the old mayor and his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2004/may/31/london.elections2004\">ex-chief of staff</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/04/london.transport\">Simon Fletcher</a>, were out in the media berating Johnson for doing what they would have done if they had been re-elected. It has been widely reported that fare increases were due to be RPI + 1% until Livingstone went into election mode. Transport for London (TfL) was gobsmacked when Livingstone came up with his \"freeze\" (which in reality was an RPI rise of 5%). So the new mayor has reinstated the 1%. <br> It is typically curmudgeonly of Fletcher to ignore that this package includes the mainstreaming of the half-price concession for those on income support and the introduction of a 24-hour freedom pass, not to mention the veterans' concession.  Johnson's critics really have no idea. They talk about details, which are largely hypothetical, and ignore the fundamentals.  They talk about lost income from the CO2 charging scheme. TfL's previous income forecasts for the congestion charge have proved so unreliable that the estimates quoted by Livingstone, Fletcher, et al came with the rider \"TfL had not assumed any revenues from CO2 charging in the business plan\". Their estimates also assumed that only 30% of large car owners would stop coming into the zone to avoid the \u00a325 charge and no one would trade down to small cars for free. D'oh! I don't think so.  They also talk about the Routemaster scheme as if it was here already. I am sure that the mayor is serious about this idea. But, I am also sure that if it proves as expensive as some fear, then it will either not happen or be re-engineered to cost.  What about the fundamentals? As Fletcher mentioned buses, so shall I. If you go to TfL's <a href=\"http://www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/6-Statement-of-Acounts-2008.pdf\">draft annual report and accounts (pdf)</a>, you will note that total bus revenue expenditure by TfL last year was \u00a31,739m or 80p per journey. Fares collected were \u00a31,080m or 50p per journey. Last year, TfL only needed to collect the current Oyster 90p fare from every passenger it claims to carry to make a profit. Instead it only collected 50p on average and so lost \u00a3659m a year. You might say that TfL gives concessions to young people \u2013 yes but these are only about \u00a355m or one-tenth of the deficit. The freedom pass for the over-60s and disabled is paid for by the boroughs \u2013 \u00a3211m. <br> If TfL is not exaggerating its passenger numbers it should be straightforward to make substantial surpluses. Either collect more fares or cut costs. Maybe do both! Cost comparisons with out-of-London operators are truly frightening. Department for Transport <a href=\"http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/statistics/datatablespublications/tsgb/2007edition/\">figures</a> show that London's bus costs in 2005/6 were \u00a32.38 per vehicle kilometer, whereas the average outside London was \u00a31.05. <br> Another illustration of TfL's inability to control costs is the number of people that TfL employ who are paid over \u00a350K per annum (numbers taken again from TfL's <a href=\"http://www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/6-Statement-of-Acounts-2008.pdf\">draft annual report and accounts(pdf)</a>). This last year has seen the total who earn more than \u00a350K leap from 1,411 to 1,954, a jump for 543 people or 38%. To be fair, some part of this jump must be down to TfL's takeover of Metronet. It is still pretty eye-watering that TfL employs the best part of 2,000 people who earn over \u00a350K. <br> The upper echelon of \u00a3100K-plus earners has increased at a good rate too. Last year's number of 112 has jumped 10% to 123. With 123 geniuses working for them, you might think they could stop the bus strikes.  It is straightforward to demonstrate Livingstone's wishful thinking and dissimulation. In February last year <a href=\"http://philtaylor.org.uk/?p=730\">Livingstone wrote to me</a> to say that bus subsidies would be \u00a3463m in 2006/7 and \u00a3528m in 2007/8. The outcome, as reported in TfL's draft annual report and accounts, was \u00a3617m in 2006/7 and \u00a3659m in 2007/8. That's a \u00a3285m deterioration in just 18 months on the buses alone. <br> No wonder Johnson is having to take tough action now.</p>",

  "<p>The damage caused by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/creditcrunch\">credit crunch</a> means that members of the Derbyshire and Cheshire building societies will not receive a windfall payment when the pair are swallowed by Nationwide.</p> <p>Nationwide, the UK's largest building society, is stepping in to take control of the Derbyshire and the Cheshire after both ran up losses in the recent financial turmoil. The rescue deal could also cost hundreds of jobs.</p> <p>In an announcement this morning, Nationwide chief executive Graham Beale said that it was not prepared to risk its financial stability by paying a windfall to members of the two smaller societies, as is usually the case.</p> <p>This is a blow to members of both societies, who might have expected to profit from the deal. Two years ago, when Nationwide merged with Portman, there were payouts of between \u00a3200 and \u00a31,000.</p> <p>Beale explained today that both societies have run up significant losses this year, thanks to the credit crunch and the falling UK housing market. The Derbyshire, which has assets of \u00a37.1bn, expects to post an unaudited pre-tax loss of \u00a317m for the half year to June 30. Most of this loss is due to a decline in the value of its near-prime, sub-prime and commercial loan portfolios, Nationwide said.</p> <p>The Cheshire, which has assets of \u00a34.9bn, expects to incur an unaudited pre-tax loss of \u00a310.5m for the same period.</p> <p>Nationwide said today that it plans to maintain both branch networks, which should mean no job losses there. However there are expected to be cuts at the back offices of both societies.</p> <p>\"Inevitably in the head office environment, where we have overlapping functions, we will look to rationalise. The expectation is that job losses will be relatively modest and contained, but we're reluctant to give a number at this stage,\" said Beale.</p> <p>The Derbyshire has 470 head office employees, while the Cheshire employs 356.</p> <p>Analysts believe that today's deal will put pressure on other building societies to merge as the crisis in the mortgage market deepens. With sales down by half since last year and prices set to halve in real terms from their peak, smaller societies are under pressure to join forces to provide greater security for customers.</p> <p>Many smaller societies lack the capital needed to lend at a time when rises in arrears and house price falls increase the risk of them losing money on their mortgage deals.</p> <p>This year the FSA, the City watchdog led by Hector Sants, warned building societies to consider how they would survive a prolonged credit squeeze. It said they were accumulating too much risk in buy-to-let mortgages and not preparing for \"extreme stress scenarios\".</p>",
  "<p> Amref's Joshua Kyallo, with a Katine family in the background</p> <p>There are now plenty of posts across our blogs that make some sharp criticisms of the <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/katine\">Katine Community Partnerships Project</a></strong>. Katine is akin to 'a plan to grow bananas on Ben Nevis', one development expert put it in a meeting. His point was that you can do anything anywhere providing you put enough money into it.</p> <p>Amref has fiercely defended the project from this charge, arguing that the money it is putting into the Katine area is comparable to the Ugandan government's own expenditure targets. It is simply showing what you can do when the money actually gets through to such remote rural areas.</p> <p>Another complaint is that this is area-based development. One village at a time, argued <strong><a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/katine/2008/07/can_development_happen_one_vil.html\">Duncan Green</a></strong>. The history of such development is long and inglorious: it was tried in colonial and post colonial times, it was popular in the seventies but was discredited as not cost effective.</p> <p>Now, it has been taken up by Jeff Sachs in his <strong><a href=\"http://www.unmillenniumproject.org\">millennium villages</a></strong> in Kenya and Uganda, and has been controversial. But Amref insists this is a misunderstanding of the project, and that Katine does not fit conventional models of area-based development. Katine is not designed to end up a model village. It is a model of the mechanisms essential to how good aid can and should be delivered, Amref argues. It's a big difference.</p> <p>Finally, as one shrewd old hand put it in Kampala to me, 'I'm not interested in pilot projects, all I want to know is, can Katine be scaled up? Is it replicable?'</p> <p>Such is the sense of urgency in African rural development that everyone is hunting for a magic solution - what is the single biggest factor which makes change across vast parts of the continent happen?</p> <p>Some argue that it is women's education, others argue that it is <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/katine/2008/jun/11/health.projectgoals\">mosquito nets</a></strong> which halve the disease burden, thus releasing family income and restoring strength for increased agricultural productivity. Yet others argue that income generation is the key to everything - staying at school, better health.</p> <p>Amref is tackling all these issues in an integrated approach that builds on the interconnections between <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/katine/health\">health</a></strong>, <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/katine/education\">education</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/katine/livelihoods\">livelihoods</a></strong>.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/katine/2008/sep/08/empowerment.katineamref\">I put many of these points to Joshua Kyallo</a></strong>, Amref's Uganda director, to get a better sense of how he and his colleagues designed the project and what is their 'theory of change' as the experts put it. What does he think makes things happen in a village like Katine in Uganda?</p>",
  "<p>Battleship Potemkin (1925) commemorates the mutiny of 1905. The mutiny was brutally suppressed by military force. Twenty years later, the events were reclaimed as a chapter in the heroic pre-revolutionary struggle of the Russian people. The film established Sergei Eisenstein as a director of international standing. The Odessa Steps sequence, with the screaming nurse and the falling perambulator, is amongst the most famous of cinema history.</p> <p>The Russian revolutionary leaders embraced film as a propaganda tool. The technological apparatus of cinema, its systems of production and the collective experience of film, made it perfect for the promotion of revolutionary ideals. Furthermore, the relative newness of cinema exempted it from the corrupted values of longer established art forms. The industrial production of films, and their distribution by train, allowed news of the revolution to be circulated to the vast Russian interior.</p> <p>First attempts at revolutionary struggle in Russia failed. The assumption that revolution would most likely stem from Russia's extensive agricultural population proved mistaken. In fact the agricultural workforce was, however oppressed, too uneducated, superstitious and dispersed to provide a &lt;h2revolutionary force. It was the concentration of industrial labour, and the military hiatus of WW1, that allowed the Russian underclass to achieve critical mass. It was natural, in terms of this political geography, for the cinema to provide a powerful focal point for revolutionary participation.</p> <h2>Eisenstein</h2> <p>Eisenstein's Potemkin uses the story of naval mutiny as a backdrop against which to play out the class struggle of revolutionary politics. The corrupt officer-class is presented as part of a highly developed and oppressive military-industrial complex that supports the exploitation of workers and maintains the brutal power of the Tsar. The comfortable gentility of bourgeois Odessa is, in consequence, an illusion maintained by force.</p> <p>The poster for Potemkin designed by the Stenberg brothers, arranges these class elements into a powerful design of revolutionary upheaval. The poster comprises three pictorial elements: the battleship, the officer and the able seaman. Each of these signs is placed in relation to the others. The fragile balance of bourgeois society is revealed at its very tipping-point.</p> <h2>The military industrial complex</h2> <p>The six large guns of Potemkin dominate the poster. The arrangement of big guns in armoured turrets was a characteristic of the new Dreadnought style of battleship. The rotation and elevation of guns, made possible by hydraulic controls, was a development of naval architecture made possible by industrialisation.</p> <p>The Dreadnought battleship was an armour plated and floating gun platform. In contrast to the traditional broadside fire pattern of naval battle; the new ships could direct their guns, any which way, at a much wider field of engagement. The ships were the sum of technological advances in shipbuilding, armaments and hydraulics. At the end of the 19C, the capability to develop these destructive machines was limited to only the largest and most developed industrial economies.</p> <p>For idealistic Russians, these powerful weapons were symbolic of imperial hubris and of military futility. In political terms, the ships were a symbol of miss-allocated resources and the administrative corruption of Tsarist control.</p> <h2>Officers and men</h2> <p>The control and function of Potemkin depended on the disciplines of naval efficiency. These were enforced through the strict hierarchy of military organisation. The ruling elite gave management of these mechanisms to an officer-cadre. The officer figure is understood as a representative symbol of undemocratic control. The naval officer is shown wearing blazer and flannels.</p> <p>The Stenbergs positioned the protagonists of Eisenstein's class struggle on the barrels of Potemkin's big guns. This arrangement was immediately recognisable from the fairground entertainments of trials of strength. The officer is shown being thrown overboard whist the able-bodied seaman balances, with victorious elegance, at the very tip of a gun. The relative position of the protagonists, and their visual relationship to the oppressive machinery of Potemkin, speak of revolutionary vortex.</p> <h2>The Stenberg brothers and Russian constructivism</h2> <p>Georgii and Vladimir Stenberg were film poster designers. The brothers were part of a group who continued the radical experimentation of Russian Constructivism. Their poster designs were able to communicate the dynamic reality of cinema through the graphic language of montage and close-up. These elements were arranged using exaggerated perspectives, as in the Potemkin poster, to reveal the new geometry of political power.</p>",
  "<p>On magazine covers in France last week I kept noticing photos of a chic woman I didn't recognise but who was clearly pregnant and possibly 42. \"Some Cannes actress up the duff,\" I muttered and thought no more. </p> <p>Only on returning to Britain did I realise the mystery thespian was actually <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachida_Dati \">Rachida Dati</a>, Nicholas Sarkozy's high-flying justice minister, the Gallic Jack Straw. As the child of North African Muslim immigrants, the unmarried and decidedly secular Dati ticks a lot of prurient boxes for the media, even in France where discretion usually prevails.</p> <p>Contrasting French tolerance towards public sexual permissiveness (at least in Paris) with American uptightness - as usual Britain is caught somewhere in between - some Fleet St papers wondered \"how long the French can get away with it?\" Since the father of Dati's child is publicly unknown \"who's the dad?\" - VIP or one-night stand? - is part of the fun, if you like that sort of thing.</p> <p>In the corner of rural France where we hang out folk don't gossip much to strangers. But in the week when the TUC meets in Brighton to fight for the living standards of its members my holiday prompted another question about the way the French live: \"How long can they all get away with it?''</p> <p>The question was lodged in my mind when we stayed overnight in Orleans, 80 miles south west of Paris. It's a handsome, historic city of 110,000 or so, quietly prosperous like so many less well-known places in France. </p> <p>What startled me was to be reminded just how much such places simply shut down for the annual fortnight's holiday - or longer - in August. </p> <p>Orleans may be a tourist town but if the local customers are heading to the Med or Atlantic coasts, the lakes or mountains, so does most of the retail trade, even major department stories like Galleries Lafayette in Orleans. Row upon row of shops had \"back on August 25\" - or September 1 - signs Sellotaped to the window. </p> <p>I know Paris is quiet in August. So is London, though it doesn't suspend parking charges for the month, as the French capital does. </p> <p>Its retail sector and restaurants certainly don't shut down. Perhaps they should. But as we have moved towards a 24/7 consumer culture since Margaret Thatcher's controversial repeal of Sunday trading the French have moved the other way, reducing the working week to 35 hours a week in 1998. </p> <p>It is a law subsequently modified, but still making for complicated opening hours, often different every day. Sunday closing is de rigueur.</p> <p>\"They're not acquisitive in the way we are. If they can pay the bills and the car starts in the morning, they're more concerned with family and food, with enjoying life,\" a long-time English resident later explained over a coffee at the market in Villefranche. \"The shopkeepers say, 'we're entitled to a holiday too.'\"</p> <p>I wouldn't quite express their anti-materialism quite that way, since they charge a lot for services (I think the meaning translates differently) and are keen to be paid in cash. That is why French banks have to restrict the amount their customers can withdraw from ATM machines in a given period, to curb the black economy. </p> <p>In Italy, friends tell me, Berlusconi's new regime has relaxed such restrictions: a bad sign. Sarko is trying to reform bad habits - and has an electoral mandate to do so. But yesterday's papers quote a French teacher complaining that they don't want him copying British suburbs. \"They're all slaves to the free market over there (Britain), it's just like America.\" Sarkozy has an uphill struggle.</p> <p>All the same, you can see their point of view. France is a beautiful, diverse and largely uncrowded country with some wonderful habits. It's corny, I know, but every time I marvel at the butchers, the bread, the country markets, the cheese. </p> <p>The downside is the difficulty of getting a coffee in downtown Orleans before 10am. or of knowing exactly when the shops will be open for basics - or unexpectedly closed. I've been trying to get it right for years and still fail.</p> <p> Sometimes, I swear, they shut when they think some looming customers might disrupt their day. Heading south this year we found ourselves off the motorway (much less stressful) near <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issoudun\">Issoudun</a>, which boasts an excellent restaurant in La Coquille. Did they have a table for lunch? Had we booked? No. In that case, sorry but no. After a pizza and pastry round the corner I peeped through La Coquille's window: it didn't look too full to me.</p> <p>This may be a standards thing (the chef can only supervise so many excellent meals), but in Paris on our last night a kind woman hesitated, then fitted us in. But I think it's deeper attitude at work. </p> <p>I tried to buy a few bottles of Tariquet, a striking Chardonnay/Sauvignon blend from Gascony which I like, at what passes for the village wine merchant.</p> <p>In week one the charming patron told me her supplier was on holiday. I was busy in week two. In week three I found her closed on Tuesday and Wednesday as well as the (usual) Monday. </p> <p>Heading for home on Friday and spotting she was open, I stopped and found some Tariquet on the shelf at last. \"I'll take a case of that,\" I said. \"Sorry, they're my last four bottles and he's told me there won't be any more this year. Come back next year,'' she said - but nicely.</p> <p>Do you laugh or cry? I laughed and took the four bottles, plus two more she recommended so she gave me a bottle for free. Trying to buy her favourite pain au raisin across the street my wife had the same experience: sorry, we've sold out (this was mid-morning).</p> <p>It all infuriates me, even more so a close friend who has to juggle French labour laws and meet a payroll. Yet at one level I admire its deep-seated, producer-orientated bloody-mindedness and the majority's quality of life.</p> <p>Alas, back in the car we started listening again to The Age of Uncertainly, the 9-CD abridgement of Alan Greenspan's memoirs, a gift from my son. Yes, <em>that</em> Greenspan, the ex-chairman of the US Federal Reserve. You listen to Arctic Monkeys or Catherine Cookson if you want to. I prefer US monetary policy.</p> <p>Chairman Al is a clever chap, as he would admit without the threat of torture. And he tells a good, if discreetly-worded, tale of serving five presidents, not including Nixon, whose private personality disturbed him. </p> <p>Nixon and Bill Clinton were the cleverest, but he greatly admired Gerry Ford for decency, quiet self-confidence and straight-dealing: a moderate Republican like himself. </p> <p>You can tell Greenspan must have been quietly appalled to discover that Ford veterans like Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld had become born-again ideologues by the time they joined George W Bush's White House team in 2001.</p> <p>That's not my point. Nor is his relief that \"my good friend Gordon Brown\" and Tony Blair had dropped the damaging economic nostrums of Fabian socialism by the time they took power in 1997.</p> <p>Central economic planning doesn't work; what has worked to extend global prosperity to untold millions is the rule of law, entrenched property rights and capitalism, plus accountable democratic governments, Greenspan believes. </p> <p>His hero is Brown's fellow-Kirkcaldy-ite, Adam Smith, author of The Wealth of Nations (1776) and champion of the \"hidden hand\" of the market. He's not a hero in France.</p> <p>Greenspan's memoirs strike me as a bit disingenuous, sometimes plain na\u00efve, about politics, a craft which he has seen close up, albeit from a ringside seat. </p> <p>He condemns the damaging economic impact of authoritarian regimes and Latino economic populism, of Fabian socialism and communism, all of which end up making poor people poorer than they need to be. </p> <p>He is acutely aware - as the TUC will be in Brighton this week - of widening inequality of incomes in many countries (China's gap is wider than the US's own, he claims) and how it may lead to false remedies. Latin America needs more market capitalism, not less, to break the distortions of oligarchical power, says the chairman. </p> <p>As for the US, it will correct its own failures, he believes - a touch complacently, I thought. American financial capitalism recklessly privatises profit and socialises the risk and a lot of it happened towards the end of Greenspan's long (1987-2006) tenure at the Fed. The emergency rescue of Fanny Mae and Freddy Mac this weekend underlines just how serious things have become.</p> <p>Where is this ramble leading me? Back to France, of course. Not to Ms Dati's baby - the jazz-loving intellectual Greenspan is a bit of a prude - but to the country's way of life. </p> <p>Most French voters would rather work for the government; only 35% believe market capitalism is the best way (half the US proportion); France has slipped to 45th on the economic freedom scale, he notes; its unemployment remains stubbornly high.</p> <p>Despite boasting some very successful global firms, \"it is difficult not to be gloomy\" about France in the new age of globalisation, concludes Greenspan, quoting Jacques Chirac to the effect that \"ultra-liberalism is as big a danger as communism was\" and his ex-premier \u00c9douard Balladur calling markets \"the law of the jungle\". </p> <p>The EU has \"culture-driven structural problems\" which have slowed growth and pushed up unemployment, he insists. Italy's plight is worse than France's and Japan's protracted slump arose because the system there refused to lose face by liquidating failed banks and their worthless debts. </p> <p>People do vote to defer pain, they sometimes vote for folly, he suggests. Ex-British colonies are among the most prosperous, thanks to that rule of law habit, though Singapore is better on law than democracy and Zimbabwe has made every mistake in the book. </p> <p>But there is no escaping hard choices, no hiding place, not even Burma. If Greenspan is more right than wrong - I fear he is - then it means my village wine merchant and her fellow-countrymen may have to raise their game. </p> <p>Come to think of it, some of her bottles have acquired distinctly-Australian-looking labels lately, though she denies it. Some of the contents taste a bit foreign too. Has globalisation crept into rural France? Will it save or ruin them?</p>",
  "<p>I yield to nobody in my admiration of the enterprise culture. When a friend visiting the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/gallery/2008/aug/26/nottinghillcarnival.london?picture=336967712\">Notting Hill Carnival</a> recently lamented the explanation of being charged \u00a33 to use a lavatory in a block of flats to escape the 50-strong queues for the free Portaloos, my response was: \"Good for them.\" </p> <p>When ticket touts charge vast sums for those struggling to attend some prestigious event, my response is that the organisers botched it by failing to charge a market price to start with and thus the corrective in the secondary market is a natural and useful development. </p> <p>For all this, I have doubts as to whether entrepreneurship can be taught in schools. It might make sense to release children from school early - say at 14 years of age - to go on some sort of apprenticeship. Perhaps with the proviso that they must first pass some basic standard of literacy and numeracy. </p> <p>Sending teenagers off to earn money would be conducive to an enterprise culture. But what of the alternative idea that keeping them in school can teach them how to succeed in business? The <a href=\"http://www.enterprise-education.org.uk/home.php\">Enterprise Education Trust</a> is a charity which uses \"business volunteers as role models to inspire young people\". Businessmen are trained to go and teach sixth formers about human resources, market research, design and development, and finance. A programme run by the trust books cinemas around the country for school children to listen to young, local entrepreneurs. The key message is that running a business is realisable. The businessmen might be running a pizza parlour or a coffee bar - it doesn't matter. </p> <p>More relevant is that they went to the same schools and lived in the same streets and have succeeded. EET's chairman, Sir Paul Judge, is <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/education/article4595840.ece\">indignant</a> that money promised by Gordon Brown to be earmarked for such purposes is instead going into general funding. </p> <p>The government announced \u00a350 million would be spent on enterprise education following a review by Sir Howard Davies. \"All secondary schools were sent their \u00a315,000 cheques, but with no formal requirement or way of checking that it was spent on enterprise education,\" says Sir Paul. He adds: \"Not surprisingly, schools under the most acute financial pressure have been the ones where the money has been most likely to have been spent on other things. Often, these are also the schools in the poorest areas \u2013 exactly those areas where Brown wanted to foster and revive the enterprise culture.\" </p> <p>As an example of the government announcing something and it not actually happening in real life it is depressingly familiar. A different point is what good it would have done had the promise been honoured. The trust declares that: \"Many businesses complain that young people are leaving education without the necessary skills.\" </p> <p>True enough but isn't the key complaint the ignorance of the basics? Extraneous subject matter on the curriculum - whether concerning how to have sex or how to set up a business - eats into time which could be spent teaching children to read and write. EET's chief executive, David Millar, feels this misses the point. The business dimension, he contends, enhances learning the basis. Essentially in a maths lesson a group of children whose eyes would be glazing over with boredom suddenly pay attention when it is related to making money. </p> <p>Millar calls the process \"to contextualise the learning\". \"It is particularly the case with disaffected, disadvantaged kids,\" he tells me. Thus an understanding of cash flow projections and balance sheets is inculcated. Critical if they will persuade a bank to give them a start-up loan. Millar says research has shown a shift in attitudes. Research undertaken on behalf of businessdynamics by NOP shows that the number of young people who believe they would eventually like to run their own business has risen from 35% in 2000 to 45% in 2004. </p> <p>There has also been a closing of the gender gap, with more girls keen to become entrepreneurs when they leave school. \"It is now cool to be running your own business with The Apprentice, Dragon's Den and so on,\" says Millar. \"It's not seen as just about making money. Although making money is a good thing. It is also a perception that being self-employed gives your more control over your life than being an employee. So attitudes have moved on from the 1980s Gordon Gekko 'Greed is Good'.\" </p> <p>The National Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurship is part of the trust's umbrella and assists children to set up \"real sustainable businesses\". They are able to keep the profits and sometimes continue running the businesses when they leave school. I remain a sceptic as to whether a school environment with simulated business scenarios can substitute for the exhilarating reality \u2013 the chaotic, cut and thrust of attempting to make money out of the fulfilment of an idea. But in the age of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Nudge-Improving-Decisions-Health-Happiness/dp/0300122233\">the nudge</a>, perhaps the Education Enterprise Trust are doing something worthwhile.</p>"
