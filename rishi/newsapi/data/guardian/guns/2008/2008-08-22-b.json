Why? Do you really need to ask? Because there is one, and only one, leather-jacket style icon as far as I am concerned, and that is Mr Arthur Fonzarelli. </p> <p>Fonzie's jacket is now on display in the Smithsonian Institute in Washington, as befits a piece of fashion history. But this autumn the look will be everywhere, mark my words. For the first time in two decades, leather jackets aren't embarrassing. </p> <p>Much as it pains me to say it, Fonzie probably had something to do with how the leather jacket lost its edge. Having once been the calling card of fellows of uncompromising hard-nut attitude (see James Dean and Sid Vicious), the leather jacket became a symbol of a hammier school of masculinity. Somewhere between Happy Days, Top Gun and Sly Stallone (circa Brigitte Nielsen), the leather jacket became a joke. </p> <p>But not any more. Kate Moss has been wearing a little shrunken black biker jacket for a while now. And Albert Hammond Jr of the Strokes, who had New York cool pretty much sewn up even before he started dating Agyness Deyn, recently inspired a post on a New York music blog with the completely excellent title of \"Albert Hammond Jr and His Amazing Black Leather Jacket\".</p> <p>For fashion followers on the dark side of 30, the important thing when adopting a trend like this is not to look as if you've been wearing the same jacket for two decades and come back into fashion by accident. So if you are going to wear a biker jacket with jeans, they should be skinny, not baggy. And please, not bootcut. And black or dirty grey, not blue. Or you can go crazy and wear the jacket with a skirt. Happy days, or what?</p>",
  "<p>Ten years ago Alaa Al Aswany was about to give up writing and emigrate to New Zealand. A practising dentist in Cairo, he had toiled at fiction for a decade but had been rejected on three occasions by the General Egyptian Book Organisation (Gebo), the powerful state-run publishers, the last time on his 41st birthday. \"This man told me: 'I will never publish you', and hung up the phone,\" he says. \"I had the most miserable birthday, feeling I'd never make it in literature. I'd given it everything.\"</p> <p>He made one last push. A novel was accepted by a small, independent publishers in Cairo. The first edition of The Yacoubian Building (2002) sold out within four weeks, and the novel became the Arab world's No 1 bestseller for five successive years, selling more than 250,000 copies in a region where print-runs seldom exceed 3,000. It was made into a hit film in Arabic in 2006, directed by Marwan Hamed, and an Egyptian television serial last year. The book's success spread to 21 other languages; last year's UK edition sold 60,000 copies. </p> <p>Inspired by a real art-deco block in downtown Cairo where the author had his first dental clinic, The Yacoubian Building is set at the time of the 1990 Gulf war. What were once luxury apartments in the colonial quarter have seen the flight of the rich since the 70s, and an influx of rooftop squatters from the countryside. The building unites residents from disparate milieux: from Zaki Bey, an ageing playboy and property owner, and Hatim Rasheed, a gay, aristocratic journalist, to Taha, a janitor's pious son who turns suicide bomber, and Busayna, a sexually harassed shop assistant. Al Aswany creates a microcosm of Egyptian society and the forces that plague it - ruthless profiteering, political corruption and prejudice, police torture, Islamic extremism.</p> <p>The Egyptian novelist Gamal al-Ghitani praised the book as having \"enriched the art of the Egyptian novel\", while, for the Lebanese writer and journalist Elias Khoury, it \"reinvented the popular Egyptian novel, which had died\". According to its English translator, Humphrey Davies, who lives in Cairo, the novel \"met a critical need for books to address sensitive issues in Egyptian society - political corruption and social oppression - head on. There was a sigh of relief in the Arab world: at last, a book that calls a spade a spade.\" Davies feels that, until now, acclaim for the 1988 Nobel literature laureate Naguib Mahfouz, who died in 2006, may have overshadowed other Egyptian writers.</p> <p>Al Aswany, now 51, lives in Garden City, just south of downtown Cairo, with his wife, Iman Taymur, and their two daughters, May, 12, and Nada, 11. Speaking in a hotel beside the Nile, and later in London, he says he is unwilling to give up his clinic, despite being a rarity among Arabic novelists in being able to live from his writing (Mahfouz was a government bureaucrat). \"Dentistry is my window on Egyptian society,\" he says. \"Success can be dangerous - you get isolated. But if you block your contact with the street, you're in trouble. More than 60% of Egyptians are below the poverty line. I must keep loyal to them, or I'll lose everything.\"</p> <p>For 15 years, Al Aswany has written newspaper columns critical of President Hosni Mubarak, who has been in power since 1981. He is a member of Writers and Artists for Change, and Doctors for Change, within the opposition movement known as Kifaya (Enough). Barred from the premiere of Hamed's film of his book at the insistence of the government, whose high-ups were there, he says: \"I felt I had so much power. They were obliged to hear my ideas, but they couldn't tolerate my presence.\" Literature, he believes, \"does not change the situation - for democracy you must engage in direct political action - but it changes the reader, teaches us to be less judgmental\".</p> <p>His latest novel, Chicago (2007), has sold more than 120,000 copies in Arabic, and an English translation is published on September 1. Set around a Chicago campus in the present, it draws on two years the author spent at the University of Illinois in the mid-1980s, on a scholarship to study dentistry. The focus is on Arab expatriates, including the poet and medical student Nagi, who is involved in a movement for democracy. Through characters such as Salah, an Egyptian intellectual in love with a Jewish-American woman, and Shaymaa, a veiled woman who questions the sexual constraints of her upbringing, the novel tackles issues such as extra-marital sex, abortion and antisemitism. It exposes a pervasive system of patronage in which mediocrity rises and rebellion has grave costs. Some readers have been disappointed by a failure of nerve on the part of one of the rebels. \"When Salah was supposed to make a stand, I was hoping he'd make it,\" Al Aswany says. \"But he lost his courage. This is happening every day. Giving a picture of people who are not very courageous is a way to push you to do something yourself.\"</p> <p>One student in the novel is a spy for the Egyptian secret police in a post 9/11 world of collaboration between US and Arab security services. An exiled dissident is seized by the FBI on charges fabricated by Egyptian intelligence. \"I love America but hate American foreign policy, coming from a part of the world damaged for years by it,\" Al Aswany says. \"The cooperation between the FBI, CIA and Arab dictators is documented, even in Congress. American detainees are exported to be tortured in Arab dictatorships, and they come back with confessions. Why do dirty work in my house if I can do it elsewhere?\" While a shadowy political heavyweight named the \"Big Man\" is off-stage in The Yacoubian Building, in Chicago an unnamed Egyptian leader shows up. His demeanour is haughty, \"as if he were a crowned king\", and \"his hair, dyed jet black, was rumoured to be one of the best hairpieces available in the world\".</p> <p>Al Aswany concedes that his success may have given him greater freedom as a writer. \"A young blogger could be arrested easily.\" He cites Kareem Amer, serving four years in jail for a blog deemed insulting to religion and the president, and his own friend Ibrahim Issa, editor-in-chief of the oppositional daily Al-Dustour, who is facing a six-month prison sentence for speculating on the health of the elderly president. \"It's a pretext - they wanted him in prison by any means.\"</p> <p>Chicago was first a hit serial in Al-Dustour. \"Some fanatics sent insults. One said he'd never accept that a veiled woman would have a relationship outside marriage. I said: 'It's a fiction; Shaymaa doesn't represent all veiled women. And if you don't like my novel, why do you read it every week?'\"</p> <p>Al Aswany was born in Cairo in 1957, an only child. His mother Zeinab, from Alexandria, was a \"real fighter\" and worked at the youth ministry. Her uncle was minister of education before the 1952 revolution that overthrew the monarchy and brought Gamal Abdel Nasser to power. Al Aswany's father, Abbas, was a \"self-made man from the south\", a novelist and lawyer who won the state award for literature in 1972, and died when Alaa was 19. \"My father gave me space to evolve. He said, 'you must keep writing. The day it's not your first priority, you must quit.'\"</p> <p>He attended the French lyc\u00e9e before studying dentistry at Cairo university. \"I had a liberal education. I was a child when Egypt was tolerant. At the lyc\u00e9e there were Jews, Copts, Catholics; we'd celebrate three or four religious feasts. This is the secret of Egyptian civilisation: we've been absorbing cultures for 60 centuries.\" That open, cosmopolitan society changed, in his view, only after Nasser's rule ended in 1970, in the late-70s and 80s - partly, he believes, thanks to the growing influence of Wahhabism, \"the desert interpretation of Islam\". Al Aswany considers Nasser a \"great leader, who guaranteed free education for social mobility, but made one big mistake: he left the machinery of dictatorship. He was the No 1 enemy in the western media in the 50s and 60s, and was afraid of establishing political parties that could be used against him. But without democratic rule, even if you're not corrupt, you lose your vision.\"</p> <p>As a dentist for 6,000 cement factory workers in southern Cairo, Al Aswany grasped at the \"opportunity to keep contact with a world I'd never see elsewhere\". His first wife, also a dentist, \"didn't understand me, though she's still my friend. I could have stayed in America or worked in the Gulf and made a fortune, but I refused. I was learning how to write.\" He also declined to churn out screenplays for Egypt's Bollywood (\"for me, it's a cerebral haemorrhage\"). When Al Aswany remarried in 1993, into a family of Greek-speaking Egyptians from Alexandria, he told his wife his only dream was to be a novelist.</p> <p>He reads four languages, including French and Spanish, but decided against emulating the nouveau roman, and was pushed towards realism by an encounter with Mahfouz in Alexandria. \"For 20 years Arab novelists have thought that the way westerners write is best, so if you tell stories you're old-fashioned. I was strongly against this. I keep my own voice. The novel is like a love affair: if you plan everything you spoil the most beautiful part.\" He found a \"language that's literary but not complicated - easy to read, but very difficult to write\".</p> <p>An early novella, The Papers of Essam Abdel Aaty (1990), and two short story collections were \"printed not published\". With friends, he paid for and distributed 500 copies himself. \"I got good reviews, but I called myself a successful writer without readers.\" \"Every time you have trouble with the corrupt system in Egypt,\" one mentor told him, \"you must respond by writing more.\" In the novella, he says, \"a young Egyptian hears government propaganda that we Egyptians taught the world how to write, and says: 'Where are the pharoahs? I don't see any.' I was accused of insulting my country - which is very dangerous.\" </p> <p>But rather than be published abroad, in Lebanon, Al Aswany held out, since imported books are easier to ban. A daring press called Merit - founded in 1998 and run by the writer and activist Mohamed Hashem - published The Yacoubian Building, before it was taken up by the largest commercial publishers in Egypt, Dar al-Shorouk. Merit also published Friendly Fire (2004), a selection of his earlier work, to be published in the UK next year. Yet even now, Al Aswany says: \"I'm making money only because I'm a bestseller in the west.\"</p> <p>In a new introduction to Friendly Fire, he takes his rejection by Gebo as a sign of the control exerted by state publishing. \"The government doesn't want writers to survive from their writing, because, in any country without democracy, an independent writer or journalist is a threat,\" he says. \"They want to keep any intellectual under pressure. You don't have the time or concentration to rebel.\" He encouraged Gebo to republish his father's work, but believes that he was punished for his own political outspokenness in the pittance they paid. He is suing Gebo to force disclosure of how it allocates public funds. \"It's not the money, it's the principle,\" he says. \"I said: 'It's the Egyptian people's money, not yours'. If I compromise, I'll betray my father.\"</p> <p>There are, he believes, \"two related struggles in Egypt: the one for democracy and justice; and the one between a tolerant culture and Wahhabism\". The strength of the Muslim Brotherhood, which has a fifth of seats in the people's assembly, allows the government to pose as a bulwark against Islamism. \"The fanatics are not real opponents of the regime, but a complication of it. If you're young and don't have hope, you're pushed to be a criminal or a fanatic.\"</p> <p>For 10 years, Al Aswany has run weekly seminars for young writers and students in downtown caf\u00e9s. \"Last year the government threatened the owner of a caf\u00e9, but we continue to meet. I'm proud that we've had young fanatics there; some have become my friends. I feel a commitment towards these young people, who don't really have an education. To be fanatic is to categorise people, not to see the human being. Literature is the opposite, it's a very individual vision of life.\" At the seminar he met the model for Taha in The Yacoubian Building. The man on whom the character was based \"was a very good student, but was passed over as a policeman because he was from the wrong class\", says Al Aswany. \"He said, 'I hate this country; this government is full of thieves', and he had a point. I felt that, faced with a certain injustice, anyone could become dangerous, a terrorist, because he had lost the dream of his life.\"</p> <p>Yet Al Aswany remains optimistic. \"Any ruler in history with strategic plans, from Alexander the Great to George Bush, has had to control Egypt. We've had terrible rulers, and been occupied many times. We're professors of compromise. But the moment Egyptians believe compromise is no longer working, they revolt. I believe we're at such a moment.\" Earlier this year, as rising food prices sparked riots, security forces were sent to break strikes that were spreading from the country's biggest textile factory, in Mahalla. Meanwhile, a crackdown on the country's media independence began last autumn. \"You can't be an unelected regime and be liberal at the same time,\" Al Aswany says. \"What we have is not freedom of expression as a tool of democracy, but freedom of talk as a decoration of the regime. For more than 10 years, you can say what you want, but the regime does what it wants. If you attack a minister, they might even be promoted.\"</p> <p>Though there has been persecution of homosexuals, \"there's a big difference between the culture and the regime\", he says. \"Arab culture was very tolerant. There's a category of Arabic poetry about homosexual feelings.\" He adds: \"You can't defend the human rights of a group in society while everybody else is deprived of them. There are 60,000 Egyptians detained without charge - many are in prison for more than 10 years - and torture is a daily practice. What's happening to homosexuals is happening to all Egyptians.\"</p> <p>Apart from lawsuits brought against Al Aswany by former residents of the Yacoubian building who claim he used them in his novel, fame has had other downsides. According to Davies, \"The stink of sour grapes is all over the Arab world about Alaa's success.\" Yet in the view of Cairo novelist Ahmed Alaidy, The Yacoubian Building boosted independent publishing and began a \"new era which can't be ignored, either by those who loved the novel or by those who hated it, as it disproved claims that Arabs aren't great readers\".</p> <p>For Al Aswany, who \"waited 20 years to be read\", his sales are a \"reward from readers. They mean Egypt is still more tolerant than it appears.\"</p> <h2>Aaal Al Aswany on Aaal Al Aswany</h2> <p><em>\"After all this time he still remembered Zeinab Radwan. In fact, he had never stopped thinking about her for a single day. The old pictures were appearing in his mind with amazing clarity. The foodgates of memory opened, came over and swept him away, as if the past were a gigantic genie let out of the bottle. There she was, standing before him, with her petite figure, her beautiful face, and her long black hair that she gathered in a ponytail. Her eyes were gleaming with enthusiasm as she talked to him in that dreamy voice of hers as if she were reciting a love poem. 'Our country is great, Salah, but it has been oppressed for a long time. Our people have tremendous abilities. If we have democracy, Egypt will become a strong, advanced country in less than 10 years.'\" </em></p> <p><strong>From Chicago, translated by Farouk Abdel Wahab (Fourth Estate)</strong></p> <p>I see the novel as life on the page that is similar to our daily life, but more profound and more beautiful. What is essential in fiction is the writer's ability to draw vivid and true characters. Through them, readers will see everything in their own lives, including social, political and religious topics, but through the art. I try to create characters who, at a given moment, become independent and decide things for themselves. Sometimes I agree with their decisions and opinions, sometimes I disagree. But I do not have control over them.</p>",
  "<p>Shopping centre owner <strong>Liberty International</strong>, the company behind the Covent Garden Estate and Lakeside in Thurrock, jumped 70p to 945p - an 8% increase - on news of stakebuilding by an American rival.</p> <p>Simon Property Group, which claims to be the largest US-listed real estate group and specialises in shopping malls, yesterday declared a 3.45% shareholding in South African-controlled Liberty.

The Dow Jones industrial average was around 150 points higher by the time London closed, lifted by comments from US Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke suggesting that inflation may come under control if the recent falls in commodity prices continued.

  "<p>The BBC recently celebrated its success in drawing 10 million viewers to the final episode of the latest series of Doctor Who, but it was still a long way short of the figures achieved by Doordarshan, the Indian state television company, which in the late 1980s drew more than 100 million viewers to its mythological epic, the Ramayana.</p> <p>This 78-part series was at the time the world's most viewed religious serial, and between January 1987 and July 1988 it more or less brought India to a standstill for an hour each week. Everyone stopped what they were doing to sit in front of whatever television was available. In villages across south Asia, hundreds of people would gather around a single set to watch the gods and demons play out their destinies. In the noisiest and most bustling cities, trains, buses and cars came to a sudden halt, and a strange hush fell over the bazaars. In Delhi, government meetings had to be rescheduled after the entire cabinet failed to turn up for an urgent briefing. </p> <p>The Ramayana, on which the series was closely based, is the first great work of Sanskrit poetry and, along with the Mahabharata, one of the two great Sanskrit epics of Indian literature. Dating in its current form from around the middle of the first millennium BC, it is traditionally credited to the sage Valmiki, who is said to have invented the sloka form (stanzas of two lines, each with 16 syllables) while writing it.</p> <p>The epic follows the life of its hero, Prince Rama, whose magical powers and divine destiny were first revealed when he broke the bow of Shiva and won the hand of the beautiful Sita. Disaster falls when, thanks to the plotting of a wicked stepmother, the couple are exiled to the forest along with Rama's faithful brother Lakshman, and Sita is then abducted by the demon Ravana. The story follows Rama's quest to rescue his beloved from the clutches of Ravana with the help of an army of monkeys led by the simian god Hanuman and the monkey king Sugriva. The story reaches its climax with a full-scale assault on Ravana's island fortress of Lanka by the forces of Rama and Hanuman, after which the separated couple are reunited and return in triumph to their capital of Ayodhya, so initiating the golden age of Ram Raja. </p> <p>It is a fabulous tale of exile, struggle, loss and redemption, and over time it grew from a local oral saga about the heroic doings of the kings of Kosala in north India to a 24,000-sloka Sanskrit epic whose action spans the entire subcontinent. For over two millennia, it has moved and inspired a diverse range of Indian writers and artists, and as the success of the television series dramatically demonstrated, it is still treasured as the common property of every Hindu - as well as that of many Muslims, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains and Christians - from the highly educated Brahmin rocket scientist to the most impoverished roadside shoeblack.</p> <p>The British Library has brought the Ramayana to London, mounting a remarkable exhibition that showcases 120 breathtaking miniatures from what is probably the most beautiful version of the story ever painted: the 17th-century Ramayana commissioned by Rana Jagat Singh of Mewar (1628-52). This found a home in Britain thanks to the Scottish scholar Colonel James Tod (1782-1835), author of the Annals and Antiquities of Rajasthan, whose almost complete absorption into Rajasthani culture led one rival to complain that he was \"too much of a Rajpoot himself to deal with Rajpoots\".</p> <p>The Mewar Ramayana - a seven-volume work that was produced by at least three different scriptoria and once included more than 400 paintings - is arguably the masterpiece of Rajasthani painting, and is certainly one of the supreme monuments of 17th-century Indian art. This great manuscript, one of the most spectacular of the many unseen treasures in the British Library's Indian collections, forms the core of the exhibition; yet the lavish show includes a huge range of other representations of the epic, demonstrating the way that the Ramayana has spread not only across India, but through the whole of south-east Asia, where it has worked its way into Buddhist and Chinese scripture and adapted itself to almost every known form of traditional media, from miniature and scroll painting to dance, drama, opera, shadow puppetry and, most recently, film and television.</p> <p>As the exhibition shows through sound archive recordings and looped videos of the TV series, film posters and contemporary live performances of the epic in towns, villages and forest clearings across the subcontinent, the Ramayana - unlike the ancient epics of Europe, such as the Iliad, the Odyssey, Beowulf and the Ring saga, which are now the province mostly of academics and of literature classes - is very much a living epic. Bards still tour villages telling the story with the help of painted scrolls, while singers sing devotional hymns recalling the valour of Lord Rama or the faithfulness of his Sita. Even more remarkably, some castes of wandering storytellers still know the 24,000-verse epic in its entirety.</p> <p>An anthropologist friend of mine once met one such storyteller in a little village in the south Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. Despite being illiterate, this particular bard knew the Mahabharata which, with its 100,000 slokas, is longer even than the seven-book Ramayana; it is said to be roughly eight times the length of the Iliad and Odyssey put together, and four times the length of the Bible. My friend asked the bard how he could remember so huge a poem. The minstrel replied that, in his mind, each stanza was written on a pebble. The pile of pebbles lay before him always; all he had to do was remember the order in which they were arranged and \"read\" from one pebble after another. Astonishingly, he said this was not the only epic he knew.</p> <p>India's population may not be particularly literate (the literacy rate is just over 60%), but it is culturally erudite. As Anthony Lane noted in the New Yorker, in the aftermath of the attacks on the US, the people of New York again and again compared what had happened to them on 9/11 to films or TV: \"It was like Independence Day\"; \"It was like Die Hard\"; \"No, Die Hard 2.\" In contrast, when the tsunami struck south Asia at the end of 2004, Indians were able to reach for a more sustaining narrative than disaster movies: the apocalyptic calamities that fill ancient Indian literature. As the Sanskritist Wendy Doniger puts it, \"Myths pick up the pieces where philosophy throws up its hands. The great myths may help survivors to think through this unthinkable catastrophe, to make sense by analogy.\"</p> <p>It is no accident that the Mewar Ramayana was composed in response to a catastrophe. In the late 16th century, as the Mughal emperors extended their control over Rajasthan, only the Ranas of Mewar managed to resist submitting to the authority of the Muslim rulers of Delhi. In the course of this resistance, their ancestral library, kept in the great fort of Chittor, was burned at the fall of that last redoubt to the Mughal war machine. Years later, when the Ranas re-established their capital at Udaipur, the Mewar Ramayana was commissioned by Rana Jagat Singh as part of the effort to rebuild his family's library, and it may have been under his influence that the manuscript came to link the Mewar dynasty with Rama (from whom it claimed descent), while connecting the demon Ravana with the Mughals. So it is that we see Ravana taking a ceremonial bath in a Mughal imperial tent, and appearing at his palace window to give darshan of himself as Jahangir and Shah Jahan did from the balcony of their apartments in the Red Fort; below the massed demons of Lanka give a salute to their king just as Mughal courtiers do in Mughal manuscripts.</p> <p>The boldly coloured, wonderfully lively miniatures of the Mewar Ramayana are the principal glory of this exhibition. Most have never before been illustrated or shown in public, and up to now have been known only to a handful of art historians. While they vary in quality, and few achieve the fineness of detail of high imperial Mughal art, the best of them - especially those by master miniaturist Sahib Din - are some of the most swirlingly energetic images ever produced by Indian artists. </p> <p>Often the more urban or palace images are compartmentalised into two or three separate areas by architectural frames and blocks of primary colour. In contrast, the rural scenes tend to be whole-frame, with the artists showing a marked and very Indian love of the natural world: dark-skinned elephants charge, trunks and tails curling with pleasure, over forested Rajasthani mountains; peacocks, white ibis and red-crowned hoopoes flit between mango orchards and banana plantations; deer nuzzle each other in the forest, as wild boar root around for nuts and berries. All Indian life is here: haggling shopkeepers decorate their stalls for a festival; groups of meditating sages and wizened ascetics with their hair woven into beehive topknots and dreadlocks sit on the ghats of a sacred river performing their austerities; palace ladies lounge amid the fountains of their zenanas and sit gossiping in their quarters; boatmen row villagers over rivers swollen in full Monsoon-spate; dancers dance, drummers drum and lovers love.</p> <p>Especially effective are the fabulous scenes of the advance of the monkey army on Lanka: against a vivid red ground, the monkeys move forward in great waves like a succession of breakers on a Goan beach. A blue-skinned Rama, with garlands of jasmine around his shoulders sits, bow at the ready, on the back of Hanuman; Lakshman follows, sitting astride a saddle of mango leaves, a quiver of arrows at the ready, and sword and dagger flashing from his waistband. Yet the Mewar artists can do pathos and beauty as well as energy and movement: Sita is invariably shown large-eyed and melancholic, as she sits mournful and pensive in her red Rajasthani gagra choli amid Ravana's pleasure gardens, awaiting her lost lover. </p> <p>The finest image of all, however, is the wonderfully comic image of the demon army trying to wake Ravana's brother, the giant Kumbhakarna: as the portly, moustachioed figure of the colossus lies horizontally across the length of the miniature in his red underpants, mouth open to emit loud snores, Lilliputian demons swarm around him, poking him with tridents and knocking him with hammers and clubs. A band of singing women is brought forward to try to rouse him; another demon brings a braying ass; two elephants are manoeuvred to trumpet into one ear, while a dog-headed demon barks into the other. To one side lie the great pitchers of wine and heaps of meat - dead humans and monkeys - intended for the giant's breakfast when he awakes. The composition is set against a yellow ochre ground that highlights the brown bulk of the giant. </p> <p>Around the central exhibit of the Mewar Ramayana is an array of supporting material that shows the spread of the epic from oral narrative to painted text, as well as from local dynastic history to pan-Asian epic: stone images of Hanuman from Vijayanagara, papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 masks of Sita from the Bengali Durga Puja, dance costumes and Kathakali headdresses from Kerala, Thanjavur ivories, Company prints, Malay shadow puppets, Kalighat woodcuts, Nayaka bronzes, Andhra textiles, Javanese paintings and Burmese embroidery. </p> <p>Although Rama was clearly identified as both the perfect man and an avatar of Vishnu by the end of the first millennium BC, there is little indication of a cult that explicitly worshiped Rama as a god until many centuries later, and there are surprisingly few images of Lord Rama extant compared to the voluminous iconography in painting, sculpture and metalwork associated with another Vishnu avatar, Lord Krishna. This began to change in the 17th century, when Tulsidas equated Rama with Brahman, the supreme deity of Vedanta philosophy, but as late as the mid-19th century there was no notion that the epic was exclusively the preserve of Hindus.</p> <p>Even before the Mewar Ramayana was painted, Hamida Banu Begum, the mother of the Mughal emperor Akbar, is known to have commissioned her own illustrated copy of the epic and asked for it to be brought to her on her deathbed. Sahib Din, the artist who seems to have coordinated the project of the Mewar Ramayana and who painted many of the most spectacular miniatures in the exhibition, was also a Muslim. As late as the 1830s, one of the first orders issued by the Mughal emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar II on ascending the throne of Delhi was to change the route of the annual Ram Lila procession - the highlight of the annual Dussehra festivities, marking the return of Rama and Sita to their city of Ayodhya and the victory of light over darkness - so that the Mughal court could enjoy the spectacle from the parapets of the Red Fort. Likewise the finest textiles illustrating the Ramayana in the show were commissioned not by Hindu rulers, but by the Muslim sultanates of Indonesia. Even today in Delhi, as in the other great Indian Muslim cities (Lucknow, Hyderabad, Agra), Muslims join their Hindu neighbours to enjoy the same festivities. It is therefore especially sad that in the late 1980s the cult of Lord Rama was hijacked by India's resurgent Hindu fundamentalists to become the major source of division and communal violence in contemporary Indian politics.</p> <p>The argument revolved around the question of whether Mir Baqi, a general of the Mughal emperor Babur (1483-1530), had built his mosque at Ayodhya over a temple commemorating the birthplace of Lord Rama. Although there was no clear archaeological evidence to confirm either the existence of the temple or even the identification of the modern town of Ayodhya with its legendary predecessor, rightwing Hindu organisations began holding rallies at the site, campaigning for the rebuilding of the temple and the destruction of the mosque. </p> <p>Finally, during the 1992 rally, a crowd of 200,000 militants, whipped into a frenzy by the political leaders of the rightwing Bharatiya Janata party, stormed the barricades. Shouting \"Death to the Muslims!\" the militants attacked the mosque with sledgehammers. One after another, like symbols of India's fragile traditions of tolerance, democracy and secularism, the three domes were smashed to rubble. Over the next month, violent unrest swept India: mobs went on the rampage and Muslims were burned alive in their homes, scalded by acid bombs or knifed in the streets. By the time the army was brought in, at least 1,400 people had been slaughtered in Mumbai alone. </p> <p>The British Library Ramayana goes some way to recovering the great epic from the hands of the fundamentalists. For this great masterpiece of Hindu art, much of it devoutly painted by Muslim artists, recalls a time when relations between Hindus and Muslims were less fraught and polarised, and when the great story of Lord Rama brought communities together, rather than violently separating them. </p> <p>It also reveals the quality of material in the library's Indian collections. Certainly, this is one of the most imaginatively mounted and vivid shows of Indian art seen in the capital for many years. It is also a wonderful farewell flourish by its curator, Jerry Losty, the legendary keeper of the library's Indian art who retired last year after 34 years, and whose final curtain call this show represents.</p>",
  "<p>A grubby billboard stands propped up against the kerb. </p> <p>\"La Casona de las Brujas\", it reads, which loosely translates as the House of Witches. </p> <p>It seems appropriate for a dark side street in Panama City's ramshackle Casco Viejo neighbourhood. I have no idea where Xili, my Panamanian friend, is taking me, but I'm pretty sure she doesn't have a secret penchant for black magic.</p> <p>Five minutes later, it becomes clear. Some sort of magic has been worked here, but it's far from sinister. What was once a Catholic girls' school has been transformed into one of the funkiest live music venues in the city. A shabby corridor leads to an open-air courtyard decked in fairy lights: the school's old wooden desks have been brightly painted, barrels have been upturned to make seats, and there's a giant portrait of the Virgin Mary keeping watch over the dancefloor. </p> <p>Panama does not spring to mind as a place to find decent alternative music, but it's fast gaining that reputation. Places such as La Casona - hosting a diverse bill of artists, national and international, signed and unsigned - are gaining huge fan bases and confounding preconceptions.</p> <p>Until recently, the Panamanian capital was a place where travellers stopped only long enough to take a photo of the canal and do a bit of shopping, before moving on to the San Blas islands or the country's other famous archipelago, Bocas del Toro, near the Costa Rican border. </p> <p>But more and more people are now using the capital as a base. As well as its nightlife and booming restaurant scene, you've also got a wealth of attractions within easy reach, including two coastlines and the breathtaking rainforest with toucans, hummingbirds, harpy eagles, howler monkeys, even the occasional jaguar if you're very lucky.</p> <p>The place that has really got people talking is Casco Viejo (also known as Casco Antiguo). Until very recently it was a slum, but now this edgy district in the west of the city is the place to be seen. A low-rise maze of winding streets filled with colonial architecture, it is at that intriguing stage where a Wifi-enabled cafe with immaculately groomed window boxes sits next to an abandoned shell of a building with no windows. </p> <p>It is also where the best nightlife is found. Bypass Calle Uruguay, a neon-lit central avenue lined with mainstream bars, restaurants and clubs, and head for <strong>La Casona de las Brujas</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.enlacasona.com\">enlacasona.com</a>).</p> <p>At the forefront of the area's artistic renaissance, the nomadic La Casona makes its home in rundown colonial properties before the developers move in. After a successful stint in the school, it's about to unveil its latest location: an art deco bank with a high ceiling and the look of a hip loft apartment, just across the road from the school at Plaza Herrera. </p> <p>\"Everyone's talking about the property boom here, but the country's music is equally explosive,\" says Fred Maduro, lead singer of the Vox, a metal and prog rock band that I see play at La Casona. \"There's huge diversity here - bands are fusing native music with rock, creating a really fresh sound.\"</p> <p>It seems the region at large is finally taking note of the country's talent too. Last November, a homegrown band, Los Rabanes, won a best album award at the Latin Grammys with their mix of ska, punk, reggae and rock. </p> <p>The jazz scene is also attracting attention. If you miss the huge January festival, try <strong>Platea</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.scenaplatea.com\">scenaplatea.com</a>) in Casco Viejo, a cosy joint with bare-brick walls that alternates live jazz nights with salsa. \"James Bond was here recently,\" the barman tells me proudly. Daniel Craig was in town shooting the latest 007 film, Quantum of Solace, with Panama standing in for Bolivia and Haiti. </p> <p>For something grittier, Fridays and Saturdays bring heavy rock to <strong>Ba\u00f1os P\u00fablicos</strong> (Plaza Herrera), which, as the name suggests, was once a public toilet. Behind sliding grill doors is a venue little bigger than a garage, painted black and decorated with glinting CDs hanging from the ceiling. The lack of frills makes you feel as if you've gatecrashed a squat party. \"Make sure you pay for your beers. They sometimes forget to charge,\" is the advice from the receptionist at my hostel, <strong>Luna's Castle</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.hosteltrail.com/lunascastle\">hosteltrail.com/lunascastle</a>, $10pp pn).</p> <p>Panama City's nightlife is enough to make a person nocturnal. But sleep through the day and you miss Panama's other big draw: the beaches. </p> <p>Here not only are you faced with the usual dilemma of which bathing suit to pack to the beach, you also have to pick a coast, Pacific or Caribbean. I consider tossing a coin, but I decide to opt for the one that's been recommended by a local. \"Well, it's a Caribbean island . . .\" she begins, and I am sold. </p> <p>I board a diablo rojo, or \"red devil\", as these ubiquitous converted American school buses are known in Panama. Resembling drive-by art shows, each one is covered roof-to-bumper in graffiti. (Think macho caricatures of Tupac and Beanie Man mixed, oddly, with cartoon characters and fairytale castles.) I make a brief stop at Portobelo - once a major hub for trading gold, now a likeable town, with a Unesco-listed ruined fortress and a forthcoming role in the Bond flick. Then, it's just a short hop to the shores of Isla Grande.</p> <p>Despite the name, Isla Grande isn't that big - just 5km by 1.5km, with a population of around 200 people of African descent, most of whom live in colourful, low-rise buildings on the strip surrounding the main landing dock. Homely restaurants, bars and posadas dot the coast, while a winding path through a forest filled with coconut palms, banana trees and fist-sized butterflies brings you to the more isolated northern shore and the small, luxurious <strong>Bananas Village Resort </strong>(<a href=\"http://www.bananasresort.com\">bananasresort.com</a>, from $109pp pn).</p> <p>I arrive on a weekday, so there are no crowds of daytripping urbanites. A two-minute walk from the dock takes me to a peninsula of empty sand, with shallow waters that are a tie-dye spectrum of blues. </p> <p>Isla Grande may not have the remote isolation or indigenous tribes of the San Blas archipelago, a 50-minute flight (or three-hour jeep and boat ride) to the northeast of Panama City. But it has got the clear-watered beaches, and a laidback vibe. \"Check out: 2pm,\" reads the sign outside the waterside posada Caba\u00f1as Cholita, home to colourful mosaic-covered walls and quirky lobster decorations. </p> <p>Activities on the island include snorkelling (keeping an eye out for Francis Drake's lost coffin, rumoured to be lying somewhere in these waters), rambling to the central lighthouse, or taking a boat trip round the mangroves. </p> <p>But, in keeping with the spirit of the island, I do none of the above. Just lying on the sand and splashing about a bit suits me fine. Besides, there's lots of eating to do: cerviche, chichemie (a corn drink that resembles cold rice pudding) and cheesecake at a thatched cafe called <strong>El Nido del Postre </strong>(overpriced and not very Panamanian, but irresistible nonetheless).</p> <p>One thing I can't miss, however, is the famed Black Christ statue, revered by islanders and displayed just off shore. On October 21, the Black Christ festival sees Portobelo and its environs inundated with thousands of pilgrims. Some walk the entire 58 miles from the capital, crawling the last mile on their hands and knees. Although, being Latin America, the reverence is combined with a carnival atmosphere and lots of dancing. </p> <p>It's hard to picture this low-key idyll swarming with people. My stay on Isla Grande is peaceful and brief. But as tempted as I am to stick around, the pull of the city is just as strong. Besides, another trip may already be on the agenda. Rumour has it the Mexican reggae roots singer I saw at La Casona has a gig at the weekend. Not on a Caribbean island or the Pacific coast, and not in the hip capital city, but in the middle of the rainforest. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> STA Travel (0871 230 8512, <a href=\"http://www.statravel.co.uk\">statravel.co.uk</a>) has flights from Heathrow to Panama City for \u00a3598 rtn, inc tax.

  "<p>I'll do workshops on Shakespeare with children as young as three. None of the plays is out of bounds. You can ask six- or seven-year-olds, what does it mean to be a man? What are the consequences of our actions? Hamlet means something to them. It's all there: love, hate, fear, joy, and using the mask of theatre it becomes a safe forum to look at happiness and sadness, what it means to be alive.</p> <p>You see Shakespeare and think about the different roles you play in your own life. Prospero is father to Miranda, master to Ariel, tormentor to Caliban. We relate to these figures and question our own roles in life. My family moved around quite a lot. I'm rooted in my family, but moving from school to school, town to town, meant I sought out community. Theatre was a ready-made community, a place to find happiness. I don't have children at home but I have plenty at work. I've learned to relinquish a little control, not to be afraid of a little chaos. I'm passing something living on to them and younger children accept it because they haven't yet developed social masks. </p> <p>It's wonderful when you see an eight-year-old playing Macbeth with passion and integrity. They claim the stage. Sometimes I'll hear a teenager say, 'That Shakespeare's sick' as they leave. In Southwark, that's a real compliment. That makes me happy. <strong>Craig Taylor</strong></p>",
  "<p>As I approached Zakynthos on the ferry, the sea had the supple smoothness of shark skin and the late haze of morning was rising up the green flanks of the island, leaving the houses of Zakynthos town bathed in sunlight. Further along the coast, bright daubs of red pantiles could be glimpsed through palm trees and sprays of pink bougainvillea. As we entered the harbour, the passengers crowded to the rails, most of them locals on the way home - priests and widows in black, the rest more colourful. </p> <p>All the familiar ingredients of a perfect Greek morning. Now here are a few extra elements: death threats, beatings, illegal building, rampant corruption and shocking environmental degradation that threatens one of Europe's most endangered species, the loggerhead turtle, in its prime Mediterranean nesting area. None of this is readily visible on arrival, particularly if you are a first-time visitor like myself. I stepped off the ferry and looked around with an approving eye. After a five-day odyssey by train through Europe, I was looking forward to diving into that wine-dark sea, tasting some fish, drinking a few glasses of ouzo.</p> <p>We usually accept places for what they are on first contact. Only when we return years later do we start to grumble, \"It's ruined!\" That morning, Zakynthos looked great. An hour later </p> <p>I was standing on a hillside with Yannis Vardakastanis and I was seeing things differently.</p> <p>Born on the island in 1964, Yannis has packed several incarnations into one life: teenage sailor on freighters to the far east, centre forward for Lincoln City Football Club, and beach-bar proprietor serving up drinks and good humour to the tourists on Zakynthos's Gerakas beach, one of the favourite egg-laying sites of the loggerhead turtle. Then, in 1990, standing at his bar on the sands, looking out over his uncle's loungers to his brother's pedalo operation, across the hundreds of tourists, he had an epiphany.</p> <p>\"That day there were 1,800 people coming to the beach and I realised I was completely wrong,\" he says. \"Such a crowd of people in a turtle nesting area was doing a lot of damage. I decided everyone had to get out, get off the beach.\"</p> <p>Turtle protection is certainly one of environmentalism's toughest assignments, not only because of the conflict with tourist development. In winter the Zakynthos loggerheads migrate to the north African coast, Malta and Sardinia, further complicating the story. By the time a turtle has dodged the many hazards - fishermen's nets, plastic bags, seagulls, tourists' sunloungers - only one in a thousand will make it back to the beach of its birth and breed.</p> <p>The realisation that turtle numbers were falling led Yannis to do the unthinkable: he dismantled his beach bar and moved it on to land above the beach. His family thought he was crazy, but in fact he had become what at the time was another of the island's rare species: an environmental activist. </p> <p>\"When I was a kid,\" he says, \"I'd be alone on the beach and go out swimming with the turtles and dolphins. In summer the beach at Gerakas would be black with hatchlings. I didn't appreciate it at the time, but I was living in God's pocket.\"</p> <p>For the past 18 years Yannis has been working to restore a little bit of that lost paradise. His small group of cottages at Gerakas offers a very different experience to the island's resorts: quiet, simple accommodation in the gardens and olive groves behind the beach. The nightlife, apart from the cicadas, consists of the local builder and his sons, who do a mean set of classic folk songs at the taverna. The main beach at Gerakas is never crowded, but for real seclusion there are a couple of rocky coves where there is room to stretch out a towel or two. I went snorkelling in one of them with my son, Conor, and we found ourselves watching squid moving among shoals of tiny colourful fish. The turtles, however, did not put in an appearance. </p> <p>\"It's the turtles that highlight the problems on the island,\" Yannis says. \"Their nesting sites are the main tourist beaches, and their nesting time is exactly the same as the European holiday season. We have to find a way that humans and animals can co-exist.\"</p> <p>At Gerakas beach, it seems they are finding a way. It has not been easy - Yannis has had to deal with everything from death threats to the anger of members of his own family - but now Gerakas is the best beach on the island. The pedalos have gone, as have the beach bars and food sellers, and only about 120 sunbeds remain. At sunset the beach closes to all except turtle protection workers. Yannis has his own conservation group, Earth Sea and Sky, which works with Archelon, a Greek NGO. Volunteers from the two organisations patrol the island's beaches, counting and marking nests and keeping night-time vigils as the turtles come in to lay their eggs. Those I spoke to were full of enthusiasm and many had been coming for several summers. \"I love the night-time beach patrols, watching the turtles climb up the beach in the moonlight,\" a British volunteer with Archelon told me. He was in his third summer and already planning a fourth. </p> <p>To this first-timer, standing on a hillside looking over the southern side of the island, things seem pretty good. The hillsides look fresh and green, the sea deliciously cool, but then Yannis starts to point out a few things. \"See the tower over there? That's the airport. They built it on top of our only lake, which was a major migration point for thousands of birds, including flamingoes.\" I give myself a pat on the back for not arriving by air. </p> <p>Then he stands up and his accusing finger moves to the left, to the crust of development at the end of the bay. \"That is Laganas, the main tourist town for Zakynthos, very popular with the British. I want to show you Laganas.\" We drive down. The green of the hills gives way to an ugly mess of scrubland and concrete ribbon development, and then we are into Laganas: bars, strip joints, cheap drinks. A pair of shirtless youths roll across the street guffawing drunkenly. The majority of the island's visitors are British - more than 600,000 of them every year. Laganas is where this summer nine British female tourists found themselves charged with prostitution after taking part in an \"oral sex competition\" in one of the bars. Yannis doesn't get out of the car; he cannot bear Laganas. </p> <p>I wander along the packed beach. The sea is full of swimmers and boats. There are glass-bottomed boats huddled together, circling a turtle while everyone gets the essential photo. Most turtle injuries on the island are caused by boat propellers. A girl assails me with an offer of a turtle-watching trip. Her sign says, \"We care for the turtles!\"</p> <p>\"How do you care?\" I ask.</p> <p>She smiles. \"We don't kill them by driving the boat over them.\"</p> <p>\"Until the 1980s Laganas, with the airport just behind it, was a big freshwater ecosystem as well as the main nesting site for loggerhead turtles,\" Yannis says. \"Now the sand is packed so hard that no turtle could ever make a nest, even if it wanted to. All the building here on the beach is illegal. It is just a big club for 18 to 30s, and with all the drunkenness it has become a very dangerous place.</p> <p>\"Gerakas has been a success, but now I want to extend that success - I'm taking the message to the heart of the problem.\" He is building a turtle rescue centre in Laganas to raise awareness of the issue. It is a courageous move, and one that will bring him into possible conflict with powerful vested interests. \"Every year there are injured animals and I think they should be treated here - and then released back into the bay,\" he says.</p> <p>From Laganas we head up to the Archelon camp. Chris Dean, a British biologist, the project's co-ordinator, says: \"We have had local hostility in the past seven years. Some of our people were beaten up and the camp has been targeted.\" He grins. \"But things are getting better now. I reckon our message is getting through.\"</p> <p>Yannis is more cautious. \"Loggerheads take at least 25 years to reach sexual maturity, so we haven't yet felt the full effects of the beach development.\" Those turtles circling off Laganas are not posing for photographs, but are simply disoriented, having returned to their native beach to find it destroyed.</p> <p>Yannis takes me over the hill to see two beaches that are supposed to have full protection, being part of a marine park that was established in 1999. The first shock is to see a landfill tip inside the park boundaries. The guard refuses to allow us close enough to take photographs. \"Apart from pollution problems, the tip attracts seagulls, the main predator of baby turtles, and it is right above Dafni beach, a major nesting area,\" Yannis says. What is most surprising about this rubbish dump, as announced on a noticeboard outside, is that it was 75% funded by a \u20ac1m grant from the EU. </p> <p>Further down the track are more unpleasant surprises. Dafni beach has several illegal buildings, including two tavernas. The Greek government has been committed to clearing the buildings since 1984, but it seems the authorities are big on legislation, but short on action. The road barrier at Dafni, intended to keep cars out, is up and clearly unused. An Archelon volunteer tells me that the beach here is not patrolled by the turtle-watchers because the locals are too hostile.</p> <p>Sekania, the adjoining beach and the most important nesting site on the island, has been made out of bounds to visitors. This, says Dean, is proof that the marine park is starting to fulfil its purpose. \"We've got 185 nests there this season,\" he says.</p> <p>Yannis and the Archelon workers represent a future for Zakynthos in which tourists and turtles each have a place. Back at Gerakas, watching Yannis's father's donkey graze contentedly under the olive trees, it seems to me that it is the cheap glitz of Laganas whose days are numbered.</p> <h2>How you can help</h2> <p><strong>Earth Sea and Sky</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.earthseasky.org\">earthseasky.org</a>), set up by Yannis Vardakastanis, runs volunteer projects and activities throughout the summer.

  "<p>A little before dawn on a recent summer morning, a convoy of three large blue lorries, a handful of police cars and a bus rumbled along the dual carriageway heading north out of the Bulgarian capital, Sofia. Even if it had not been so early, the motorcade would probably not have drawn much attention. The lorries were unmarked, the bus carrying a few sleepy policemen was old and scruffy, while the lumbering shipment was big and slow enough to explain the escort and its flashing blue lights.</p> <p>But for Bulgaria, and indirectly for the rest of us, the convoy's progress marked an important transition - the departure of the country's last remaining stockpile of High Enriched Uranium (HEU), the stuff of which nuclear bombs are made. It took two years of talks and preparatory work before the highly radioactive material - just over 6kg of spent fuel from a defunct research reactor - was fished out of the storage pools in which it had lain unused and largely forgotten for nearly 20 years. It was sealed in steel casks - custom-made by ...koda, the Czech car manufacturer - and lowered into the three anonymous blue trucks.</p> <p>Over the course of the morning of July 5, the convoy made its way over the mountains and down to the banks of the river Danube, where the containers were winched into a long, black barge bound for Ukraine. Ten days and a rail journey later, the HEU arrived in Russia, whence it had come nearly half a century earlier as a gift. In Chelyabinsk, just east of the Urals, it is to be reprocessed or blended down. I was permitted to witness its secret journey on condition that nothing was printed until the shipment reached its destination, and this small but massively lethal fragment of the cold war was made safe.</p> <p>The operation was the latest in a series - part of an accelerating scramble to clean up the scattered legacy of nuclear profligacy. In the 50s and 60s, the US and Soviet Union exported HEU-powered nuclear reactors to their allies for power generation and experimentation. When the cold war finally came to an end, deals were done on dismantling the redundant weapons in the former Soviet republics. Under a programme called Megatons To Megawatts, one tenth of America's electricity is generated from uranium from thousands of former Soviet warheads. The Russians blend down HEU in the warheads to Low Enriched Uranium (LEU), which cannot be used in bombs; the Americans transport it to nuclear power stations back home.</p> <p>However, that still left thousands of kilograms of weapons-grade material, mostly HEU, in civilian reactors at power stations and universities around the world, some with no more security than a watchman and a padlock.</p> <p>As the logic of deterrence and mutually assured destruction recedes from the collective memory to be supplanted by the fears evoked by the September 11 attacks, nuclear terrorism has emerged as the number one threat to western security. The suicidal extremist driving a crude nuclear device into the centre of a major city is now the ultimate nightmare. George Bush and Tony Blair went to war in Iraq with the ostensible aim of preventing Saddam's assumed nuclear stockpile falling into the hands of al-Qaida jihadists. Barack Obama has called nuclear terrorism \"the greatest danger we face\".</p> <p>The gap between rhetoric and effective action, however, is startling. The US has so far spent $648bn on the war in Iraq to eliminate a threat that never existed. The amount spent on removing fissile material from countries that actually do have the ingredients for a nuclear device has been paltry by comparison. The Global Threat Reduction Initiative (GTRI), launched in 2004 after previous efforts at eliminating the world's civilian stocks of fissile material had proved ineffectual, has an annual US budget of about $150m, or roughly what the US military spends in eight hours in Iraq. Britain allocates a respectable \u00a336.5m a year to the programme, most of it on helping to secure nuclear sites in the former Soviet Union, but that still pales in comparison to the \u00a31.7bn cost last year of keeping troops in Iraq.</p> <p>There is no question that the threat of nuclear terrorism is real. As long ago as 1998, Osama bin Laden declared it was a religious duty to acquire nuclear weapons \"to terrorise the enemies of God\". Just days before the September 11 attacks in 2001, the al-Qaida leader met a Pakistani delegation, including two retired nuclear scientists, in Kandahar. According to accounts of that meeting, Bin Laden expressed keen interest in how to build a bomb and was told it was technically quite simple - acquiring the fissile material was the main obstacle.</p> <p>Al-Qaida has spent years trying to overcome that problem. Western intelligence officials believe the organisation was cheated several times by middlemen claiming to have weapons-grade material for sale. An al-Qaida defector, Jamal Ahmed al-Fadl, has described helping Bin Laden clinch a deal in Sudan, his home country: Bin Laden paid $1.5m for a 30-inch cylinder supposedly containing South African uranium. The cylinder is widely believed to have been a fake.</p> <p>Ivan Ivanov, a Bulgarian businessman working for a Dubai-based building contractor, claims to have met Bin Laden in Pakistan in April 2001, and to have been approached the day after the meeting by an al-Qaida scientist who proposed a scheme for buying Bulgarian nuclear material. Ivanov says he turned down the deal, but Bulgaria has remained a source of concern for anyone worried about proliferation. The country's post-Soviet nuclear industry has been hit by one safety scandal after another, and the EU has taken the unusual step of cutting off funds because of the hold that corruption and organised crime have on the country's economy.</p> <p>The removal of Bulgaria's HEU last month was therefore more than a technicality. It represented the elimination of a significant threat. Officials at Sofia's Institute for Nuclear Research and Nuclear Energy, where the spent fuel had been stored since its reactor was shut down in 1989, claimed security had been beefed up in recent years, but the Institute was clearly suffering from years of neglect. Feral dogs chased each other through the bushes in the grounds around the reactor.</p> <p>The removal operation was overseen by a two-man American team, who represent the business end of the Global Threat Reduction Initiative. Their job is to fly around the world trying to persuade governments that it is in their long-term interests to part with their stocks of fissile material.</p> <p>The US duo are both immigrants. Andrew Bieniawski, a 41-year-old from South Africa, is in charge of the programme at the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), the part of the US department of energy that is responsible for looking after the US nuclear arsenal, making sure the bombs still work and do not blow up unexpectedly. His deputy, Igor Bolshinsky, a former mine technician from the Ukrainian coal city of Donetsk, has responsibility for repatriating the Soviet-origin material and does most of the travelling and persuading - \"Schmoozing for world peace,\" as Bolshinsky put it.</p> <p>\"This is what keeps us on the road 70% of the time,\" he said. \"We see different reactors in different conditions, and we know this removal has to be done very fast. We don't want to give more time to people who are preparing to steal this material.\"</p> <p>In Sofia, Bolshinsky had been in fine form, cajoling, joking and flattering Bulgarian officials in a mix of Russian and English. He was consequently stunned on the designated day of the uranium's departure when Bulgarian security - somewhat prickly over the arrival of this ebullient American employee in the nation's inner nuclear sanctum - ordered the uranium convoy to leave the institute an hour earlier than agreed, without bothering to tell Bolshinsky. </p> <p>In the past few years, Bolshinsky has overseen uranium removals from Libya to Vietnam, and has been tailed in the course of his duties by some of the world's most persistent secret policemen, but this stunt stretched his sense of humour to breaking point. \"Not good, not good at all,\" he said emphatically when he turned up at the reactor at dawn to find the car park empty. He jumped into a car for a high-speed chase along a Bulgarian motorway, in pursuit of the missing uranium casks.</p> <p>He finally caught up with the convoy about 32km north of Sofia, parked on the hard shoulder of the motorway. Ivan Gorinov, the head of \"physical protection\" at Bulgaria's Nuclear Regulatory Agency who appeared to have taken the decision to leave early, was unapologetic. \"I don't care about the American taxpayer,\" Gorinov said defiantly, and a touch sulkily, when he was reminded that the exercise had been US-funded. Nor did he hide his lack of enthusiasm for the presence of journalists, suggesting that we might prefer to see a wet T-shirt competition underway in the nearby town of Kozloduy than observe the casks being loaded on to the giant barge.</p> <p>Gorinov said later he would have been less nervous if the HEU shipment had gone by rail, but the necessary transit agreements would have taken too long to negotiate. It had been decided to take the quicker but riskier option of moving the uranium casks about 180km to the Danube by road, where it was theoretically vulnerable to ambush or protests.</p> <p>\"That was a big challenge, from the security point of view, and from the point of view of keeping it secret,\" Gorinov said, \"but we had a constant exchange of information with the Bulgarian security services.\" A chain-smoker, he began to relax only when technicians in white coats and caps lowered the blue containers into the belly of the 86m barge and slid its long lid over them. \"It looks just like any other barge - business as usual on the Danube,\" he declared triumphantly.</p> <p>As the barge moved off downstream, heading towards Ukraine and a rendezvous with a Russian train, Bulgaria became officially free of HEU.</p> <p>There are two kinds of nuclear bomb. Modern warheads involve an implosion device, in which the fissile material, normally plutonium, is violently compressed by shaped charges until it reaches critical mass, and the process of nuclear fission becomes self-sustaining. This is an extremely hard trick to pull off reliably, and is the province of sophisticated state programmes. However, there is a much cruder form of bomb, which achieves critical mass by firing one chunk of HEU at another. A \"gun-type\" bomb such as this, Little Boy, was dropped on Hiroshima. As the apartheid government in South Africa discovered, it can be developed by a relatively small team with some basic engineering skills. It is the sort of bomb a terrorist organisation would build. Plutonium is useless for such a device. It requires HEU, which happens to be far more plentiful and much less well guarded.</p> <p>Under the GTRI, a total of 610kg of HEU fuel (both spent and fresh) has now been returned to Russia from countries including Serbia, Romania, Libya, Uzbekistan, Poland, Germany, the Czech Republic, Latvia and Vietnam. More than a third of those shipments took place in 2007, as the urgency underlying the programme has increased. US-made HEU has meanwhile been repatriated from Latin America, Europe and south-east Asia. In fact, at about the same time the uranium convoy was leaving Sofia, secret shipments of HEU and plutonium were on the way to the US from Japan, Sweden, Germany and Denmark. More than 50 HEU reactors around the world have been converted to use LEU. Four reactors have been closed down altogether.</p> <p>Hungary and Kazakhstan are next on Bieniawski and Bolshinsky's visiting list, after which virtually all the fresh HEU fuel being stored at civilian sites around the world will have been dealt with. And almost all the Soviet-origin spent HEU, which can still contain high concentrations of weapons-grade material, is due to be removed from civilian sites around the world by 2010. Bieniawski said every day counts. \"We are very concerned about this material. We take this threat to be very real. The information that we have lets us know we have to act as aggressively as possible to remove this material,\" he said.</p> <p>The programme does not include military stockpiles, which are usually better guarded and are part of a different scheme, nor does it cover \"gap\" HEU fuel, made in neither the US nor the Soviet Union, but in countries such as South Africa that ran their own nuclear programmes. Ukraine and Belarus are also reluctant to give up all their HEU.</p> <p>There is another, even more troubling, question hanging over Bieniawski and Bolshinsky's work: could their efforts already be too late? They are, in effect, running a race blindfold. They do not know if their adversaries - the terrorist groups, smugglers and bent officials with whom they work - are behind them, breathing down their necks, or ahead of them, or even whether they have already crossed the finishing line. What is beyond doubt is that they are in the race - and their footprints are all around.</p> <p>Since the end of the cold war, the UN's nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), has logged more than 800 incidents in which radioactive material has gone missing or been seized from smugglers. Eighteen of those cases involved weapons-grade material, HEU or plutonium, mostly of Soviet origin. Another seven cases of weapons-grade theft or contraband have yet to be confirmed by the IAEA, but are considered well-founded.</p> <p>In a recent example, a Russian fish trader and occasional smuggler named Oleg Khinsagov was arrested in Georgia in early 2006. He had about 100g of weapons-grade HEU in his leather jacket, wrapped in a plastic bag, and was under the impression he was about to sell his sample to a Muslim from a \"serious organisation\" on the market for fissile material. Khinsagov told his customer there were two more kilograms available. The would-be buyer turned out to be a Georgian government agent, and Khinsagov is now sitting in prison in Tbilisi, apparently too terrified of his Russian contacts to name them.</p> <p>At a time when long-standing Russian-Georgian tensions have exploded into conflict, Moscow has been unhelpful in the extreme, implausibly claiming that it is impossible to tell where Khinsagov's HEU came from. Coincidentally or not, an estimated 2kg of HEU went missing when a top-secret former Soviet nuclear laboratory in the Georgian region of Abkhazia fell to Russian-backed separatists in 1993. It simply disappeared into the chaotic underworld of the Caucasus where organised crime thrives on national rivalries, and has not been seen since.</p> <p>Last November, on the other side of the world, two groups of armed men broke into the emergency control centre at South Africa's supposedly high-security Pelindaba nuclear facility, where hundreds of kilograms of HEU are stored - they stumbled on a senior security official who was not supposed to have been there but was keeping his girlfriend company. The intruders shot him and fled. </p> <p>In formal testimony to the IAEA, the South African government admitted the attackers were \"technically sophisticated\" and had \"prior knowledge of the electronic security systems\". On the other hand, they insisted the site's fissile material had not been in danger and that only a computer had been taken. There have been no arrests so far.</p> <p>Most of the nuclear thefts located by the IAEA to date have involved small quantities of HEU, far short of the 55kg necessary to build a gun-type bomb, but no one knows how much more has disappeared unnoticed. Matthew Bunn, a proliferation expert at Harvard, has estimated the risk of a nuclear attack on the US in the next decade to be 29%. He was once asked by an investment bank to carry out a similar exercise for London. He will not say what he told the bank, revealing only that he estimated a smaller risk than his US estimate, but still \"a real number\".</p> <p>James Acton, a nuclear proliferation expert at King's College London, said, \"Even if you think that there is a one per cent, or half per cent, chance of there being such a catastrophic event, it's probably worth taking a lot more precautions than we are at the moment.\"</p> <p>A terrorist group could make do with much less than the 55kg of HEU necessary to achieve critical mass and detonate whatever it had managed to steal or buy on the black market in the form of a \"dirty bomb\". Acton said radioactive material could also be sprayed like an aerosol across a wide urban expanse, in a stealth attack that could pass unnoticed until it was too late.</p> <p>\"If people insist on the same standards [for radioactivity] we have now, we would have to give up large areas of the city. People would ultimately have to get used to the risk of going back to a slightly contaminated part of London,\" Acton said. It would be so easy to perform and so devastating in its effects, he added: \"I really don't know why an attack hasn't happened already.\" </p> <p>Dhiren Barot, a north London al-Qaida member arrested in 2004 on terrorism charges, had been planning a dirty bomb attack using tiny radioactive particles found in home smoke alarms, which he intended to buy by the thousand. Jacqui Smith, the home secretary, has said the government is taking the threat seriously and a computer simulation of a radiological attack on London was carried out by the Home Office last year. Senior officials in the Bush administration took part in a similar exercise last year, involving three simultaneous dirty bomb blasts, and Spain, another recent terrorist target, carried out a drill earlier this year.</p> <p>Meanwhile, radiation detectors are being installed in ports around the world, as a last line of defence against a smuggled nuclear device. So far they have produced literally millions of false alarms (a particular potassium isotope in bananas, for example, can set off the sirens). The White House has its own nuclear bomb squad, which it scrambled in 2005 to intercept US-bound ships suspected of carrying a weapon. It turned out they were carrying scrap metal contaminated by illegally dumped radioactive material.</p> <p>This is the emerging battlefield of the 21st century. Western governments have little idea whether they are being overly paranoid or recklessly negligent in their preparations. The potential is so horrifying, there seems little choice but to prepare for the worst.</p>",
  "<p>The alleged killers of the British honeymooners Benjamin and Catherine Mullany are under investigation for similar murders in Antigua.</p> <p>Detectives are studying at least two other unsolved killings almost a month after the Welsh couple were shot during an overnight raid on their holiday cottage and five days after two men aged 20 and 17 appeared in court charged with the crime.</p> <p>Like the British tourists, the victims, both local men in their 20s, were shot at close range during robberies that went wrong, according to Gary Nelson, the commissioner of the Royal Antigua and Barbuda police force.</p> <p>\"We've now had four people shot in the back of the head this year. That's a rare thing,\" he said. \"For me, that's a modus operandi. It tells me that it could be the same guy or the same group.\"</p> <p>With the help of detectives from Scotland Yard and South Wales police, the cash-strapped Antigua force has been looking into the background and associates of Kaniel Martin, 20, and Avie Howell, 17. The two unemployed locals are accused of attacking the Mullanys at the Cocos resort in the early hours of July 27, the last day of their honeymoon.</p> <p>Catherine Mullany, 31, a newly qualified doctor from Pontardawe, south Wales, was killed instantly and her husband of two weeks, a trainee physiotherapist also aged 31, died on August 4 at Morriston hospital, Swansea, after being flown home in a coma.</p> <p>Three women remain in custody in connection with the murders - Howell's girlfriend, Jeorgette Aaron, 31, who is alleged to have shielded the killers, and two Hispanic women aged 32 and 22 said to have handled mobile phones and a camera stolen from the Britons.</p> <p>Three British detectives stayed behind in Antigua from an original team of eight to study evidence in the other cases.</p> <p>Nelson said their expertise helped restore confidence in a chronically under-equipped police force faced with 19 murders in 2007, another 12 this year and a matching surge in armed robberies and assaults. With a population of only 83,000, the country's murder rate has climbed to three times that of New York.</p> <p>Nelson, a former senior officer with the Royal Canadian Mounted police, accepted a two-year commission in February to reform the troubled force.</p> <p>On his first day, he arrived at police headquarters to find there had been no running water for 18 months and buckets left in the bathrooms for flushing toilets.</p> <p>\"The conditions for the officers are worse than appalling,\" he said. \"The police stations have no back-up power, so when the electricity goes out, everything goes out. The roofs leak and all our buildings have rooms that are unusable.</p> <p>\"My deputy commissioner went out on an overnight traffic patrol and found the officers weren't even equipped with torches. He ended up buying some from his own pocket. Eighteen of our [45] patrol cars are not serviceable and we need bullet-proof vests and guns.\"</p> <p>Despite the hardships, Nelson sees hope in almost 100 recommendations made after a review last year. The report favours pay rises for all officers but proposals to improve working conditions have yet to be implemented.</p> <p>Chris Ryan, an American law enforcement consultant, says he was so disgusted with the shortages he saw during a month spent training Antiguan officers in June that he set up a private website encouraging citizens to buy crime-fighting items.</p> <p>The items include metal handcuffs for $29 (\u00a316), 100 nylon wrist restraints for $170 and bigger items such as bulletproof vests, electronic stun guns and 9mm pistols. He said: \"It's insane to expect to reform a police department when you don't give them what they need.\"</p> <p>Nelson admits there has been some political backlash since the website went live last month, but said that donors had responded. Two local companies have bought 10 computers and six bulletproof vests at $800 each, and another has pledged to fund another 100 vests.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Mullany murder case has hastened a government review of security procedures and guest safety. </p> <p>The tourism minister, Harold Lovell, said the former crown colony wanted to retain the confidence of the estimated 100,000 annual holidaymakers from Britain. He pointed out that the last time a foreign national was killed in Antigua was in 1995. \"We have a great deal of affection for our British visitors,\" he said. \"We want to tell them this was an isolated incident and that they can still come and have a good time without being fearful.\"</p> <p>The government also intends to introduce hanging for those convicted of serious gun crimes, the justice minister, Colin Derrick, has announced.</p> <p>Public revulsion at the murders was reflected in a large anti-crime march and rally in St John's organised by the country's hotels and tourism association and addressed by Sir Vivian Richards, the cricket legend and respected island elder.</p> <p>\"We must come together as a nation to fight crime,\" said the former West Indies captain. \"These are hard times and we have to move with these times.\"</p> <p>Ted Isaac, chairman of the hotels association, said the effects of the murders stretched beyond the country's tourism-fuelled economy.</p> <p>\"This incident is not Antigua, it's not who we are. We respect life, we can have fun and we are a serious people. We feel horrible this happened,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>The fictional Jeeves of PG Wodehouse's stories liked to relax with the complete works of Spinoza or Dostoyevsky. He knew how to overhaul a car, play a mean hand of poker and could rustle up a hangover cure in no time.</p> <p>Bertie Wooster's valet was and remains the quintessential manservant clich\u00e9. But if you thought butlers had died out with the setting of the sun over the British Empire, you'd be wrong - they are alive, well and discretely tending to the needs of an elite, modern clientele. And nowhere are their services more in demand than in London's top-end hotels.</p> <p>So how much of Jeeves' renaissance man image remains in the modern-age butler? The Connaught, in Mayfair, is one of those luxury piles which simply oozes old money. From the pressed and polished doormen to the marble flooring, it's about as far from a futuristic techno-boutique as you can get.</p> <p>But don't let that fool you into thinking that its service techniques are as old as its glorious 19th-century surroundings. Gone are the days of buttling just being about silver-service and excessive politeness. These days, a butler needs to be switched on to the demands of the modern traveller.</p> <p>And this is why two of them are sitting in the \u00a31,000-a-night Grosvenor Suite with a beauty demonstrator finding out about peptides. Various jars and tubes are passed around and we smear an anti-ageing cream on our faces and learn about its clinically active ingredients. Emmet McDonagh leans over and says, with just a teeny trace of sarcasm, \"Well you've only got one skin, haven't you ...\"</p> <p>McDonagh and his colleague, Martin Binks, are among the Connaught's 15-strong butler corps. That number is expected to rise to 25 by next spring and each new recruit is being trained in a very modern buttling style.</p> <p>Aged 33, and originally from Galway, McDonagh is the hotel's head butler and has been working here since January. His background is in food and beverage and he attended hotel school in Ireland before travelling round Australia and then coming to London and working for the Four Seasons and now the Connaught.</p> <p>Binks, from Leeds, has been working in the hotel industry since the 1980s after completing an economics degree. He managed a gentleman's club in London in 1990 and then worked in the States as a private butler before becoming head butler at the Lanesborough Hotel in Knightsbridge. </p> <p>Both are amiable gents. McDonagh has a dry aloofness and Binks has a fondness for a witty comment or a self-deprecating remark. But both are the very model of discretion and if you're expecting tales of JLo-Mariah divas and unreasonable demands, you'll be sorely mistaken. They will venture, however, that Will Smith is a very nice chap and that somebody once asked one of them to pick out the broken cornflakes from their breakfast.</p> <p>Earlier we took a short taxi ride to high-end shoe shop John Lobb on Jermyn Street. Connaught butlers spend five days in the John Lobb factory in Northampton learning about leather, shoe assessment, brand history and treatment. Until you have encountered the passion of Andres Hernandez, you haven't worn shoes. \"I am an obsessive,\" grins the dapper product development manager as he deftly shines up a pair of black John Lobbs.</p> <p>It might seem a particularly old-fashioned career option to be satisfied with serving someone else but, says, Binks with a wry smile, \"The old saying is true, 'No man is a hero to his butler.' There is a big difference between serving and being servile too and I, personally, get a lot of satisfaction from making someone's life easier.\"</p> <p>Raise the subject of peers thinking you've sold out by \"just\" being a butler and it's a complete anathema to the men sitting before me. \"Why would they?\" says McDonagh incredulously, \"We earn good money, we have job satisfaction and we get to do a whole range of interesting jobs.\" Binks adds, \"I can't really see myself wanting to do anything else. I am on all the floors all the time. I don't want to be stuck behind a desk or in an office. I would be so bored.\"</p> <p>And the money's not bad either. Hotel butlers, says McDonagh, can earn upwards of \u00a330,000, with private butlers raking in anything up to about \u00a355,000.</p> <p>Butler training at the Connaught takes about three weeks but, depending on the person, this could be quicker. There are a few butler training schools around the world, including the Butler-Valet School in Oxford, which offers a six-week training course including the serving of wines, care of silverware and china and preparing a dining room.</p> <p>Back at the Connaught, shoe-shining and skincare aren't the only skills butlers are being trained in. As a response to 21st-century guests' demands they are trained by BlackBerry on key troubleshooting skills including basic rebooting, most-commonly used (and least-known) shortcuts and time-saving techniques, as well as diagnostics. The hotel also plans to have a skilled BlackBerry technician available for butler usage, basic iPod training and instruction on Vertu phones.</p> <p>Connaught butlers will in the future be required to undertake training with Roja Dove, the master perfumer, in order to advise guests on the best scent to suit them. The course will include learning about base notes, top notes and key scents. Says McDonagh, \"We definitely have moved on from the traditional butler role. Our guests know about luxury and they know what's out there. Our job is to go that extra mile for them.\"</p> <p>Part of the role, he explains, is reading the guests. \"We know the guest's name and what their requirements are before they arrive. We go through arrivals the day before and make sure everybody knows. We also have a tracker for each floor and each room.\" </p> <p>Binks adds that it's also about knowing how much of this special treatment is actually desired by the guest: \"On meeting the guest we have three basic questions: 'Had a good journey? First time to London? Any plans while you're here?'. If we get a no, no and a maybe, then we know that we should get out sharpish. Some people are a lot more forthcoming and might want everything explaining.\"</p> <p>On arrival at the hotel, a guest is shown to their room by the receptionist, who introduces them to the butler. The butler then goes through the room orientation, or \"rooming\" as it's more commonly known.</p> <p>The technology is in evidence from the word go. A large telephone with a touch-screen is the first port of call. Then the butlers might set up printers and faxes or assist with computing issues. Says Binks, \"I certainly know my way around most basic IT problems and if not, I know where to look.\" He also reveals he usually knows the forthcoming weather, how to navigate his way to most parts of London and what's on at West End theatres.</p> <p>Colin Gaunt teaches at the Butler-Valet School in Oxfordshire. He has worked in Buckingham Palace, Blenheim Palace, Woburn Abbey and the US Embassy. He agrees that - quite apart from the technological advancement - the role of the butler has become more multi-tasking: \"You have to have a can-do attitude and if you don't know how to do most things you have to know where to find out. Years ago you had the house manager, butler, cook, chauffeur. Now the butler is all those things and the dog walker too.\"</p>",

  "<p>Seventy years ago, Europe was plunged into the deepest crisis experienced since the end of the first world war, paving the way for the rapid descent into a new, even more terrible, world conflict. Few historical developments have been more extensively researched and reassessed than the critical events of 1938, and there have been fierce debates, in particular, about Hitler's aims. Did he have a clear ideological programme, a blueprint consistently followed? Or was he a brutal, unprincipled opportunist, with a gift for propaganda and lust for power, together with a sharp eye for exploiting the weakness of the western democracies? Could German aggression be attributed simply to Hitler's megalomania, or did it represent more deep-seated forces in society, particularly the strength of the military and of big business? Did Hitler, in other words, follow or break with traditional aims in German foreign policy?</p> <p>Historians have wrestled with these questions over the years. But they have gradually arrived at some clear answers. We are currently enjoying a rush of major books about the Third Reich by British historians, and these books are noteworthy not least because they reflect the fact that there are now generally - if not universally - accepted conclusions about Hitler and the run-up to war.</p> <p>An obvious starting point in the debate is the publication in 1961 of AJP Taylor's Origins of the Second World War, which set out to be controversial. For Taylor, Hitler was no more than an opportunist, operating without any plan or programme other than vague notions of expansion. Taylor's real villains were the appeasers in Britain and France whose political ineptitude opened the door. It was a maverick interpretation, which was heatedly contested. Hugh Trevor-Roper convincingly argued that Hitler was a man of ideas, however repulsive. Tim Mason, emphasising the economic pressures arising from German expansionism that made a drive to war inevitable, came close to claiming Taylor did not know what he was talking about. In Germany, Taylor's interpretation was scarcely taken seriously, but the antithesis of his approach was at its most forthright in a work that still forms the most fundamental assessment of prewar German foreign policy, Gerhard L Weinberg's masterly The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany, in which Hitler's goal of domination is absolutely central.</p> <p>Recently, Adam Tooze's acclaimed study The Wages of Destruction (Penguin, 2006) has offered a novel approach - looking at Germany's long-term economic weakness in relation to the US as the key to German aggression. As a determinant of prewar foreign policy Tooze perhaps overemphasises Hitler's preoccupation with the threat from America. But he successfully adds increasing economic pressures on the Nazi regime to the ideological thrust that produced those pressures. And he is also one of the few historians to link the radicalisation of antisemitism to the growing proximity of war, as increased international tension underpinned notions of a \"world Jewish conspiracy\" behind US policy.</p> <p>Jonathan Wright has produced the incisive Germany and the Origins of the Second World War (Palgrave, 2007), while German foreign policy is also explored, as part of the structure of the Nazi regime, in Richard J Evans's The Third Reich in Power (Penguin, 2005) and, with particular focus on Hitler's role, in my own biography of the German leader.</p> <p>So what are the generally accepted conclusions? Hitler had no plainly defined programme. But to dismiss him as merely an opportunist would be wrong. He did have a limited but inflexible framework of ideas that gave consistent direction to his leadership. Its twin tracks, embedded in a sense of race as the key determinant in history, were \"removal\" of the Jews and expansion to the east to obtain land to secure Germany's future. Both imprecise, distant goals served, once Hitler had taken power in January 1933, as guidelines for action for every facet of the regime, without ever having to be spelt out in overt policy terms. Much was adapted to rapidly changing circumstances - but within the parameters embodied by Hitler's ideological \"vision\". </p> <p>Before 1938 there was no incompatibility between Hitler's long-term goals and the interests of the military (and other sections of the power elite) in the build-up of German armed force, renewed national strength and standing, and the profits to be made from an expanding armaments industry. But, as would become ever more apparent from 1938 onwards, Hitler was not just following traditional lines of German policy. Taylor's characteristic throwaway line that \"in international affairs there was nothing wrong with Hitler except that he was a German\" (leaving aside the fact that he was actually Austrian) is misleading. Hitler could indeed build on expansionist traditions in the German power elite. But his increasingly unassailable leadership position and his racial obsessions distorted those traditions, then took policy into uncharted territory as the war progressed - producing ultimately the moral and physical ruination of his country.</p> <p>If even in retrospect it hasn't been easy to arrive at a clear assessment of Hitler's aims, it is little wonder that contemporaries inside and outside Germany were unsure how to deal with him. The year 1938 marked the high-tide of the attempts of the western democracies to appease Hitler. \"Munich\" is still a byword for the ignominy that attaches to Chamberlain's attempts to buy off Hitler at the expense of Czechoslovakia. Chamberlain's reputation cannot be rescued. But recognition of the grave errors of judgment of policy-making in the 1930s has come to be seen in the perspective of the realistic options open to the British government at the time.</p> <p>The first crisis of 1938, over Austria, arose so suddenly that the Nazi leadership was itself caught unawares. It was triggered by the announcement on March 9 by the Austrian chancellor, Kurt von Schuschnigg, that there would be a plebiscite three days later to determine whether Austria would remain an independent country. The result would have been a foregone conclusion, but the plebiscite never took place. Incensed by Schuschnigg's move, Hitler reacted swiftly. On March 11 the Austrians were bullied into submission, Schuschnigg and the president, Wilhelm Miklas, forced to resign. Lord Halifax, the British foreign secretary, had told Schuschnigg that \"his majesty's government are unable to guarantee protection\".</p> <p>Hitler's axis partner, Italy, offered support for the annexation, prompting effusive expressions of Hitler's gratitude. Hitler's man, Arthur Seyss-Inquart, was installed as the new chancellor. But even with Austria under Nazi control, Hitler ordered the Wehrmacht to cross the Austrian border. He himself followed later that day, March 12, making slow progress through the jubilant crowds of Austrians before reaching his home town of Linz. Under the emotional impact of his tumultuous reception, Hitler decided that mere satellite status for Austria was not enough. It had to be full incorporation. Legislation for this was hurriedly devised on March 13. Before the evening was out, Austria was merely a German province. A month later, on April 12, in the perfect result for a plebiscite staged by a dictatorial regime, 99% approved the Anschluss.</p> <p>Though the Anschluss crisis had erupted rapidly and the Nazis had largely made brutal policy on the hoof, it would be mistaken to share Taylor's view that the way in which Austria had fallen under German control had been for Hitler \"a tiresome accident, an interruption of his long-term policy\". It was in fact a direct outcome of the interlinked ideological, military-strategic and economic strands of Nazi policy that had developed over the previous five years. The ideological imperative of expansion, necessitating rapid rearmament, which ensured Hitler's backing in the military leadership and big business, made Austria a strategic target - even apart from Hitler's wish to unite his homeland with the Reich and the growing clamour for union among Austrian Nazi supporters (about a third of the population). The speed of rearmament had led to severe economic bottlenecks. Austria offered much-needed iron-ore deposits, other raw materials and supplies of labour. </p> <p>It was little wonder that there was growing pressure for political union between Germany and Austria, which was already heavily dependent economically on the Reich. In the second half of 1937, Hitler spoke menacingly about moving soon against Austria. And when, on February 12 1938, Hitler met Schuschnigg, he browbeat him into major concessions on German influence there. The plans for a gradual absorption of Austria by Germany were then thrown overboard by Schuschnigg's peremptory announcement of the plebiscite. The crisis followed. But it was a crisis waiting to happen. It was indeed directly provoked by Schuschnigg, rather than Hitler, as Taylor stated, but only in the sense that an unlocked car might provoke someone to steal it. Hitler's furious reaction at Schuschnigg's move should not be taken as evidence that the crisis was unwelcome to the German dictator. On the contrary: it was an opportunity he was avid to grasp with both hands.</p> <p>Hitler knew his action would be swallowed by the western powers. Halifax had implied as much when he had met Hitler the previous November. Chamberlain certainly did not like the brutal methods used. But, speaking to the cabinet's foreign policy committee two days after the Anschluss, he said \"he did not think anything that had happened should cause the government to alter their present policy\" of seeking a general settlement of Europe's problems through the appeasement of Germany. He was, in fact, even more sure that this policy was correct. Appeasement was about to be subjected to a much sterner test in the Czech crisis that was widely expected to follow Hitler's triumph in Austria.</p> <p>The German takeover in Austria left Czechoslovakia completely exposed. And it was even more important than Austria as far as German expansionist aims were concerned. But German aggression was fraught with danger. Since France was treaty-bound to back Czechoslovakia in the event of aggression, and Britain was allied with France, a German attack ran the high risk of European war. The Soviet Union, too, had treaty obligations with the Czechs and had indicated its willingness to help the French. </p> <p>For Hitler, however, there could be no holding back. Precisely because of the alliances between Germany's enemies east and west there was no time to lose in destroying Czechoslovakia if his expansionist intentions were to be realised. Economically, too, the country was a tempting prospect, with its strong industrial base, big armaments factories and important sources of raw materials. The 3 million-strong ethnic German minority in the Sudetenland, abutting Germany, offered the pretext for an allegedly nationalist policy publicly targeted at bringing them \"home to the Reich\". Across the summer of 1938 Hitler ratcheted up pressure on the Czechs. War appeared increasingly likely. But most Germans were horrified at the prospect of another conflict only 20 years after the end of the first world war. Internal reports spoke of a \"war psychosis\" in the German population. The army was divided. The chief of the general staff, Ludwig Beck, advocated a collective stand by the military leadership, but was left isolated and he resigned in August. Whatever their apprehensions, most generals remained loyal. However, for the first time, there were stirrings of resistance among some individuals in high places, and plans began to take shape to have Hitler deposed in the event of a strike against Czechoslovakia.</p> <p>Probably nothing would have materialised. There were inevitable weaknesses in the clandestine planning, the most obvious being a dependence on the willingness of the army's commander-in-chief, Walter von Brauchitsch, a weak reed if ever there was one, to support a coup. But in any case the hopes of the plotters were destroyed by Chamberlain. Wedded to his policy of buying off Hitler, and determined to save Europe's peace, Chamberlain had desperately embarked on shuttle-diplomacy, flying on September 15 to visit Hitler at Berchtesgaden, then a week later at Bad Godesberg. The German dictator simply increased his demands. Even now, Chamberlain was persuaded that Hitler was speaking the truth in wanting no more than \"racial unity\" with the Sudeten Germans. But his personal appeal to Hitler fell on deaf ears. War seemed inevitable. </p> <p>Then the near impossible happened: Hitler backed down. Britain, supported by France, had pressed the Czechs into cession of the Sudetenland to Germany. Mussolini had then intervened, appealing to Hitler for a postponement of troop mobilisation and acceptance of a negotiated settlement along the lines of the British proposal. Being effectively given what he had claimed he wanted, Hitler conceded with bad grace. The result was the infamous carve-up of Czechoslovakia in the Munich agreement on September 30, decided at a four-power conference of the Germans, French, Italians and British. The Czechs themselves were not present at the mutilation of their own country. </p> <p>Hitler had wanted war to destroy Czechoslovakia completely, not a negotiated settlement for a part of the country. His plans went way beyond the \"homecoming\" of the Sudeten Germans. But when Britain and France agreed to give him what he purportedly wanted without war, he had no pretext to fight. \"You can't carry out a world war on account of modalities,\" his propaganda minister, Joseph Goebbels, remarked.</p> <p>Born out of weakness, with resources and military commitments (in different parts of the world) stretched to their utmost, and rearmament programmes (opposed until late in the day by Labour and the Liberals) still in their early stages, Chamberlain's drive for appeasement was a logical outcome of the years of drift, hesitancy and hope for the best in British foreign policy, coupled with the deep fears of a repeat of 1914-18. His military chiefs advised against going to war. The Dominions did not want to fight over Czechoslovakia. Despite their large army, the French, too, had no appetite for a fight: Verdun was too recent a memory. The League of Nations was by this time scarcely even a paper tiger, devoid of credibility since its divisions and pusillanimity had been so clearly laid bare following Mussolini's invasion of Abyssinia in the autumn of 1935. </p> <p>And across the Atlantic, the militarily weak US was only just emerging from the comforting illusion of isolationism and starting to show concern about developments in Europe. On hearing that Chamberlain was on his way to Munich, where a sellout to the German bully was the only outcome in sight, Roosevelt cabled \"Good Man!\" to the British prime minister. </p> <p>All in all, Chamberlain was dealt a terribly bad hand, which, however, he then proceeded to play badly through his mistaken assessment of Hitler's aims and his over-eagerness to placate the dictator with territorial concessions. The only hope resided, as Churchill advocated, in creating a \"grand alliance\" with the Soviet Union to deter and put pressure on Hitler. Chamberlain opposed this. Antipathy to communism undoubtedly played its part. But his stated reasoning was that an alliance of Britain, France and the Soviet Union, evoking the alignment before 1914, would ensure that Hitler went to war rather than pull back from conflict. He was probably right that this would have acted as a provocation to Hitler rather than a deterrent. </p> <p>In any case, the \"grand alliance\" had, in practice, little to offer. Though Stalin claimed his troops were ready to march if Hitler invaded Czechoslovakia, the Red Army - devastated by recent purges - would have had its passage through Poland and Romania blocked. In the west, France was looking for a way out of honouring its commitment to Czechoslovakia, and Britain did not want to be tied through its alliance with France to fighting for a people in a \"faraway country\" of whom \"we know nothing\". So Chamberlain, having laid his poor hand of cards on the table at Berchtesgaden and Bad Godesberg, was forced to surrender them - and with them the fate of Czechoslovakia - at Munich. </p> <p>The elation at having preserved \"peace for our time\", which Chamberlain reported to delirious crowds on his return from Munich (he received 40,000 letters of congratulation), evaporated almost instantly. Shame and national humiliation at what had been done in Britain's name replaced it. Yet many who came to heap opprobrium on Chamberlain after the event had earlier supported the policy of appeasement. Tumultuous cheering came from all sides of the House of Commons when Chamberlain announced he was going to Munich. Members of all parties were eager to shake the prime minister's hand, though it was obvious to everyone what the trip to Munich must mean: that peace could only be saved through sacrificing the Czechs.</p> <p>Was Chamberlain merely buying time, as he still claimed in 1940, when he remained adamant he had done the right thing? What would have happened had Britain gone to war over Czechoslovakia in the autumn of 1938? No military aid from Britain or France would have been forthcoming for Czechoslovakia. Probably Hitler's forces would have quickly vanquished the Czechs (as war games predicted). Internal opposition in Germany would have come to nothing. A phoney war somewhat similar to 1938-39 would have set in a year earlier. True, German forces and defences in autumn 1938 were nowhere near as strong as they were by spring 1940. But Britain's forces were at that time proportionally still weaker. Given the pressure to act, the weakness of his adversaries, and his own temperament, Hitler would probably have invaded France in 1939, which would have necessitated some (temporary) deal in the east with the Poles or the Russians. The French may well have caved in as they did in 1940. </p> <p>Whether Churchill would have assumed the premiership in Britain and succeeded in bolstering morale and defiance had war commenced a year earlier cannot, like much else, be known. But without his leadership, Britain might have been tempted to look for a settlement that would have left Germany in the ascendancy in Europe. Who knows? What did not happen is open only to the realms of fantasy, not the methods of historical research. But it is at least feasible that Chamberlain's capitulation at Munich proved ultimately beneficial to Britain - if at the expense of the Czechs and lasting national ignominy.</p> <p>Each of the crises over Austria and Czechoslovakia had a crucial effect on Nazi anti-Jewish policy and paved the way for the third major crisis of 1938: \"Crystal Night\". Though foreign policy and the persecution of the Jews are usually treated separately in the literature - Hermann Graml's Antisemitism in the Third Reich (1992) and Saul Friedl\u00e4nder's Nazi Germany and the Jews: The Years of Persecution (Phoenix, 1997) have to stand proxy for a vast literature on the latter - it is important to recognise the connections. These emerge plainly in the events surrounding the nationwide pogrom of the night of November 9-10 1938.</p> <p>The pogrom was not planned. However, it was also no accidental development. The occasion was the shooting by a young Jew of a German embassy official in Paris, Ernst vom Rath, on November 7, and his death two days later. Goebbels, with Hitler's express approval, seized the opportunity to spur on party radicals throughout Germany to give vent to the \"anger of the people\" and unleashed the orgy of violence that destroyed synagogues and other property, led to the brutal beatings and often death of hundreds of Jews, and ended with 30,000 male Jews being rounded up and sent to concentration camps as blackmail to dredge up the money to pay for their emigration. Hurried legislation was passed to force Jews out of the economy altogether, and to levy a huge, cynical \"fine\" on them - effectively for having provoked the destruction of their own property.</p> <p>Anti-Jewish violence had been escalating for months before the pogrom. Hitler had given the green light to a new wave of attacks on Jews in a tirade at the party rally in September 1937. Soon afterwards the drive to \"Aryanise\" the economy took hold and accelerated throughout 1938 as German big business, keen to maximise profits from the booming armaments industry, eagerly colluded in pressure to force Jewish concerns to sell out for knock-down prices. The economic assault on Jews was accompanied by a raft of discriminatory legislation turning Jews increasingly into pariahs on the fringes of society. And as the year progressed, the violent attacks on Jews, their property, businesses, synagogues and cemeteries drastically intensified. The growing assertiveness of the regime played its part. So did the radicalisation of anti-Jewish policy that followed the Anschluss.</p> <p>The savagery towards Jews on the streets of Vienna immediately following the Anschluss, as the pent-up aggression of Nazi hordes was let loose, surpassed even what had happened in Germany itself since 1933. The uncontrolled violence soon gave way to the more orchestrated violence of organised expulsion in the hands of the man whose ability to force out Austrian Jews established the reputation that would take him to the role of manager of the \"final solution\": Adolf Eichmann. In Germany, attacks on Jews provided a useful distraction for Nazi gangs in a summer of mounting tension. Then the Munich agreement gave a great boost to the regime's self-confidence. By the autumn, the antisemitic climate was extraordinarily menacing for Jews. The powder keg was ready to explode. It needed only a spark. Vom Rath was shot. Crystal Night followed.</p> <p>There was now a stampede to get out of the country, producing a refugee crisis. Around 120,000 escaped over the next few months. But the door to emigration was only partially pushed open. The barriers against acceptance of Jewish refugees, recently reinforced at the international conference at Evian in France in July 1938, prevented many from getting away. Chamberlain agreed to some easing of admission to Britain of Jewish refugees fleeing Germany. But appeasement was only temporarily suspended, not abandoned. He expressed hope that the \"moderates\" in Germany might even now restrain Hitler.</p> <p>In Germany itself, the unpopularity, which went deep into Nazi circles, of the violence of the pogrom (though not of the aim of removing Jews) meant that such an open outrage was not again tried within the Reich. Something even more sinister happened. In January 1939, responsibility for finding a solution to the \"Jewish Question\" (still through forced emigration) was handed over to the security police - clearing a path that would end in the gas chambers. There was no thought of gas chambers at the end of 1938. But in the fetid anti-Jewish atmosphere before and after the pogrom, notions that war would bring a showdown with the Jews - seen as responsible for Germany's defeat in the first world war and now viewed as pernicious agents in agitating for a new war - were voiced by leading Nazis. These marks of a genocidal mentality found their most outright expression in Hitler's baleful \"prophecy\" made in his big speech to the Reichstag on January 30 1939 that \"if the international Jewish financiers in and outside Europe should succeed in plunging the nations once more into a world war, then the result will not be the Bolshevising of the earth, and thus the victory of Jewry, but the annihilation of the Jewish race in Europe\".</p> <p>At the end of 1938, then, the twin Nazi aims - expansion to gain domination in Europe, and \"removal\" of the Jews - had blended into the vision of a war soon to be fought and the destruction of the Jews as an outcome of that war. The appeasers, by means of their sellout of Czechoslovakia at Munich, had bought a respite. They had not, even now, given up. Only when, in March 1939, Hitler tore up the Munich agreement and occupied what was left of the Czech lands did the scales finally fall from their eyes. Another crisis, now over Poland, was inevitable, with Britain and France finally committed to action in the event of German aggression. Hitler thought the western democracies would give in over Danzig as they had done over the Sudetenland. This time he was wrong. This time there was war.</p> <p>Looking back at 1938, we see \"old Europe\" approaching its end, before war enveloped it and before the entry on to the scene of the superpowers that would determine the ruined continent's postwar destiny. It is not a pretty sight - a Europe of bitterly competing nations, riven by the age-old clashes for dominance, now taking place in an era of hyper-nationalism with its attendant imperialist ambitions, buttressed by the technologies of total war and mass death. </p> <p>Seventy years on, our present Europe, for all its flaws and faultlines, provides such an attractive contrast that it is hard not to see the European project that arose from the lessons of the second world war and out of the far-sightedness of, especially, postwar German and French statesmen as a huge success story. The main objective of these postwar visionaries was to prevent circumstances ever again arising in which European nations could go to war with each other. The former Yugoslavia gives an example of what, not long ago, was still possible outside the framework of what became the European Union. Though \"1938\" will not be repeated, the crisis spots have moved elsewhere. The dangers to world peace are different, but still present. Having come this far, logic suggests that we need to look to a future in which, without any loss of national identity, a European voice can speak more strongly and urgently for the interests of a united continent than can the current prevailing and persistent dissonance. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Ian Kershaw's Hitler is published by Allen Lane.</p>",
  "<p>A relaxing, scenic journey, a fraction of the carbon footprint and easy connections that mean door-to-door journey times compete with flying. It is no surprise train travel to Europe is enjoying a surge in popularity. And with air fares set to rise again, as troubled airlines plan to axe millions of seats, demand for rail travel ought to be boosted further. </p> <p>But passengers booking tickets online should beware, a Guardian Money investigation has revealed. By relying on the internet, you could pay far more than you need to. </p> <p>The problem lies with the website of the largest provider of tickets to the continent, Rail Europe. The company, owned by French Railways (SNCF), has seen overall sales increase 26% in the past year. Half its tickets are now sold on the web and the proportion is rising. </p> <p>Going online is a popular way to book travel, with the ability to buy tickets at any time. Relaunched two months ago, Rail Europe's website is simple to use. Indeed, its homepage states you can \"book online and save \u00a36\" - it waives the \u00a36 fee charged to passengers who buy tickets by phone. However, for destinations in France, Switzerland, Italy and Germany, our investigation found instances of the cheapest online fares costing up to double those offered by its call centre. </p> <p>For a Saturday-to-Saturday return trip to Menton, in France, a couple of weeks in advance, the website gave the best price as a hefty \u00a3472. But when Money rang the call centre straight after, posing as a customer and asking to make the same journey for the cheapest fare on the same date, the agent offered return tickets for \u00a3239, plus \u00a36 booking fee. The difference to the journey was one extra change of train on the return leg, adding 20 minutes - not much hassle for a saving of \u00a3227. </p> <p>Even when you book exactly the same trains for both legs of a journey, prices online can be higher. A return from London to Milan brought up \u00a3389 as the cheapest fare. Over the phone, a Rail Europe agent found tickets for \u00a3311 (plus \u00a36 booking fee). So what accounts for such large differences? </p> <p>Travelling to most destinations in Europe, you take a Eurostar to Paris, Brussels or Lille, and onward connections from there. For any given destination, tickets can be priced in two ways. Take the journey from London to Milan, changing in Paris. The first type of ticket, a through fare, prices the trip in one lump. The second type, a combined fare, separates the two parts, pricing the Eurostar fare from London to Paris, then adding Paris to Milan. The cheaper tickets depend on availability so as seats get booked, prices rise. As with air fares, the basic tenet is that the less flexible the ticket, the cheaper it is. Rail Europe's website offers three bands: non-flexible, semi-flexible and most flexible.</p> <p>There is no suggestion Rail Europe is intentionally raising the price of tickets online. The discrepancy rests with the way the web booking engine works. Unless the same flexibility level is available on the outward and return legs, the web engine cannot offer it and indicates the less flexible are unavailable.</p> <p>\"Rail Europe's website doesn't let you have a non-flexible ticket for part of the way and a flexible ticket for the other part,\" says Ashwin Kumar, director of UK rail watchdog Passenger Focus. Rail Europe says that, prior to the relaunch of the website, it knew of this issue. \"The web development team was aware not all combinations of tickets would be available if a through fare was selected,\" a spokeswoman said. </p> <p>\"In the interest of offering the simplest booking experience, we had to limit the combinations of fare types available online. If all combinations were offered, the choices would be baffling to customers and the likelihood of them successfully completing a booking would be slim.\"</p> <p>That isn't good enough, Kumar says. \"The ticket engine, whether it is being used by call centre staff, ticket office staff or you on the web, should be sophisticated enough to give you those options. Rail Europe says it would be too messy on the website to offer that choice. Our view is that the website has to be able to offer the cheapest tickets, and they have got to find a way of calculating what the cheapest journey is and then presenting it in a clear way.</p> <p>\"The industry needs to develop the software to enable this, but it doesn't sound to us like an impossible task.\"</p> <p>There is nothing illegal in customers being charged more online than they need pay, however. \"Generally, it's up to a business to decide how it sets prices,\" said a spokeswoman for the Office of Fair Trading. \"We would expect costs to be clearly set out and transparent so that consumers can make an informed choice.\"</p> <p>Rail Europe argues the ease with which Money found cases of web-to-phone price difference was because we picked Saturdays two or three weeks in advance for our journey enquiries. </p> <p>\"In most cases, the cheaper non- and semi-flexible fares would not have been available on Eurostar,\" a spokeswoman said. \"That means the fare type for the onward part of the journey, whether that be to Cologne, Basel or Milan, would have to have used a flexible ticket regardless of whether a cheaper non-flexible option was available.\"</p> <p>In a statement, Rail Europe offered the following advice. When booking online, it is always worth breaking down journeys which involve more than one train. This can produce better results as it negates the necessity to match ticket flexibilities on each train. It is a slightly more time-consuming process and requires the customer to ensure they leave enough time for connections, but looking at the comparison can help reduce the fares. </p> <p>This advice - effectively asking passengers to do what call centre staff do - is not on the website. However, in response to Money's investigation, Rail Europe has put a guide to booking the cheapest online fares on its homepage.</p> <p>Still, the website often matches fares quoted by the call centre, and sometimes beats them. \"It is worth looking online first to see what is available rather than relying on the operator to find the cheapest for you,\" says Mark Smith, founder of rail travel advice website Seat61.com. </p> <p>If you want the cheapest fare, you must tell the agent. \"Sometimes you need to prompt or coerce the agent to rummage around a bit to find the best fare. There are all sorts of quirks when you book tickets for European rail travel. Getting the best deal is an art, not a science,\" Smith adds.</p> <h2>Get on the right track</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Thomas Cook Rail Map of Europe (available for \u00a38.99 plus \u00a31.50 postage and packing from <a href=\"http://www.thomascookpublishing.com\">thomascookpublishing.com</a>) will give you a clearer idea of the route you are taking and the alternatives that are available.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> For timetable enquiries, use the excellent Swiss site <a href=\"http://www.rail.ch\">www.rail.ch.</a> Trust the Swiss ...</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Check out <a href=\"http://www.seat61.com\">www.seat61.com</a> for plenty of useful advice on booking trains to and within Europe.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Don't rely only on the web or the phone.

The antivirus software group Sophos says responding will infect your computer with the Zlob trojan. </p> <p>Sophos says: \"The purpose of Zlob is to make its authors easy money. Once victims' machines are infected with Zlob, they will be inundated with fake error messages informing them of a \"problem\" on the machine. </p> <p>The user is then encouraged to \"pay for clean-up\" costing between \u00a330 and \u00a350.</p> <p>Zlob pushers used to target porn sites, where customers were encouraged to find \"hotter material\" which ended up with a trojan attack. So how did this website feature on Reed in the first place? The recruitment firm explains: \"During the last week of July, a number of suspicious job postings appeared on the site, containing details of external websites which encouraged users to download malicious codes. These postings were identified by our internal quality team and removed as soon as possible. In addition, we contacted every jobseeker who we were aware had made an online application for one of these jobs, informing them of the situation.\" </p> <p>Reed acknowledges there is no 100% secure method of ensuring on-site safety. It's back to common sense - if a job comes from someone you have never heard of and offers a fantastic salary, it is almost certainly too good to be true.</p> <h2>Our gas bill came to \u00a33,145 for nine days</h2> <p>Scottish Gas has been chasing us for a \u00a33,145 gas bill covering nine days last August on a property we left. Each time we query this, they accept it is a mistake and say they will look into it further. We have been told the amount has been written off, but statements are invariably followed by final demands. Last week, we were sent a solicitor's letter threatening us with court action if we don't pay in 14 days. Please help.<br><strong>JM,</strong> Glasgow</p> <p>Using some \u00a3350 of gas a day in August is almost impossible, even if you are in a large house and take current prices into account. So obviously there was a billing error of a ludicrous proportion.</p> <p>Whether this was your fault in misreading the meter as you moved or the responsibility of Scottish Gas (part of Centrica) is immaterial - someone should have realised there was a major mistake and organised a new meter reading and a fresh bill. Instead, the \u00a33,145 demand is in legal hands.</p> <p>After Capital Letters intervened, Scottish Gas moved to quash the bill. It will write off the amount, ignore the last nine days in the old property and send you \u00a350 as a goodwill gesture.</p> <h2>Car insurer performed U-turn on premium</h2> <p>This month, I found a \u00a3287 motor insurance quote on confused.com for my Mazda 323 with Swinton. This was better value than the \u00a3400 I had been quoted elsewhere. When I received the policy I noticed it had my car as dating from 1991, not 2003. Swinton claims this is my fault, insisting on \u00a3114 to rectify this, but my printout is clear - I had entered 2003. What is going on?<br><strong>AW,</strong> Yorkshire</p> <p>Swinton wanted \u00a3401, so there would have been no point in making the switch - Esure would have been preferable at \u00a3330. Despite producing a printout of your confused.com application, Swinton claimed it was your mistake. Any rudimentary check could have found your number plate would have been impossible in 1991 - it should have used its database for this.</p> <p>Swinton is apologetic when Capital Letters calls. It now accepts blame for the error and the inconvenience you have suffered. As a result, it will waive the extra \u00a3114, which it is pinning on an isolated systems incident - and says this will not happen again.</p> <h2>Don't share your time with these wasters</h2> <p>In 2001 we made the mistake of joining holiday club Cybertravel, paying \u00a32,000. Before too long we realised our error and tried to cancel our membership, but Cybertravel went out of business and we gave up any thoughts of getting our money back, writing it off as a bad experience.</p> <p>Last month, I was contacted out of the blue by a company called TV Travel which said it had taken over Cybertravel and was seeking to pay off its debts, including ours. The snag is that we will have to travel to the Canaries and pay a consultancy fee of \u00a3169.75 to collect the money we are owed, though our accommodation will be paid for.</p> <p>Is it possible that this can work?<br><strong>JF,</strong> London</p> <p>You received nothing for the \u00a32,000 with Cybertravel so you should get your money back. But why should any company pay off money for one that has gone bust? TV Travel says that in return for the fee - don't forget to add your fares to Tenerife - it will put you up for a week in a timeshare resort and \"during your stay you will be met by a qualified consultant who will help you claim back any lost funds due to your purchase of a holiday membership package and register your reclaim certificate\". More likely, you will be sold another holiday club package as expensive and of as little use as Cybertravel. </p> <p>TV Travel claims \"we can guarantee 90% of your monies back that you lost purchasing a holiday package\". Just how can it do this? Why should it? And how strong are its own finances? </p> <p>Cybertravel was owned by an offshore entity called Thornton Ridge, which went bust as well. It is impossible to recover money in this situation, so anyone listening to TV Travel (whose ownership is unclear) would simply throw good money after bad. </p> <h2>Accountants address mistaken identity</h2> <p>We are pensioners and have lived at our address for more than 20 years. Over the past year, we have received several letters addressed to \"Offshore Connections LLC\" at our home. We have returned these to the sender unopened. However, we opened the latest - a demand for \u00a3663 from Baker Tilly. We are concerned either this is a scam or we will have debt collectors at our front door. Can you stop this?<br><strong>JH, Yorkshire</strong></p> <p>The bill from accountants Baker Tilly relates to transactions in March and September 2006 on behalf of Offshore Connections LLC, a limited liability company whose only links with your address is that it is also in Yorkshire.</p> <p>Offshore Connections LLC was set up for Ian Clough, 44, and James Cochrane, 41, in April 2006 by Baker Tilly, which gave advice on its corporate structure. It is not clear what its business was to be but it would appear never to have traded. There is no explanation of how your address came to be associated with it but Baker Tilly contacted you to say there will be no debt collectors and it will write off the company's outstanding invoices.</p>",
  "<p>No apologies, you absolute bastards, for this column returning once again to the horror of crass religious makeover show Make Me A Christian (Sun, 7pm, C4), which draws to a close this week having prompted much wailing and gnashing of teeth - 98% of it in my living room, where each episode has been accompanied by a storm of cries, squawks, and outraged splutters. The bellows came so regularly and automatically (as an instinctive physiological response to what I was seeing and hearing) that after a while I actually forgot it was me making them. They'd become part of my flat's natural ambient soundtrack, like the ticking of the clock or the sound of mould growing in the fridge. Yell, yell, yell. It was like living on top of a yell mine.</p> <p>If you were to measure the volume of my shouts and plot them on a graph, you'd discover that the number of sonic peaks corresponded precisely to the number of close-ups of head Christian mentor Reverend George Hargreaves' simpering tortoisey face. A few weeks ago, after watching episode one, I was so incensed by his self-satisfied air of stubborn intolerance I Googled him as soon as the credits ran. Before long I'd uncovered his astonishing backstory: that in the distant past he'd been a DJ and songwriter (responsible for Sinitta's So Macho and Cruising) before becoming the head of the insanely right-wing Christian Party, which wants to denounce homosexuality, teach creationism in schools, reintroduce the death penalty, ban abortions, remove the \"satanic\" red dragon from the Welsh flag, and basically make a bollocks of everything.(Fortunately, they're not very successful, what with the general populace being aware it isn't AD1500 any more. In the recent Haltemprice and Howden by-election, George received 76 votes. But, hey, perhaps this TV exposure will build his profile.)</p> <p>Anyway, George's background is so juicy and mad, I fully expected the show to make the most of it. You know: wait till he's admonishing Laura (one of the show's volunteers; a lesbian) for her sinful gayness, then have the voiceover say, \"But George hasn't always been so opposed to homosexuality...\" and BAM! - cut to Sinitta performing So Macho on Top Of The Pops in 1983 with a caption explaining who wrote it. And move from there into a cute VT package detailing his loopy political ambitions. Didn't happen in show one. Or show two. Aha, I figured. They're saving it for the finale: a classic \"reveal\". Look! He's been a vaguely sinister weirdo all along! Gotcha!</p> <p>But no. His past and his party never warrant a mention. Instead we get the standard makeover show ending: a few participants scratching around for reasons why they feel a bit better about themselves having gone through the sausage machine. Ignore the faintly upbeat veneer and it's all pretty feeble: none of them appear to have undergone any spiritual transformation whatsoever. They may have enjoyed several of the \"tasks\", such as helping the elderly or throwing a barbecue for the neighbours, but that's because doing good deeds is fun. You don't need Christ whispering in your ear to appreciate the value of loving thy neighbour.</p> <p>In fact, the biggest hurdle each of them has had to overcome throughout the series is George himself: his robotic intolerance; his haughty judgments; his stomach-churning opinions stated as fact. Choosing him as its \"star\" has created a bizarre tension at the heart of the programme: the volunteers have been repeatedly told that Christianity is all about love and acceptance by a man who insists the world must adhere to his dementedly fundamentalist interpretation of the Bible. And by giving George a mainstream televisual platform without once pointing out what a marginal and extremist figure he is, the show is hugely unfair on yer average non-lunatic churchgoer, the majority of whom are far more likely to offer you a pot of homemade elderberry jam than hysterically denounce you as a fornicating sinner.</p> <p>Yeah, that's right. I'm an atheist defending moderate Christians. Wanna make something of it?</p>",
  "<p>Two years ago Heather Fell was about to quit the modern pentathlon. Yesterday, after 12 hours of gruelling competition across the sport's five diverse disciplines, she won an Olympic silver medal. \"It's pretty obvious,\" she said shortly after she stepped down from the rostrum, \"that I don't regret deciding to stick with it.\" </p> <p>Fell finished 40 points behind Germany's Lena Schoneborn, a margin equal to 10 seconds in the pentathlon's final event, the 3km cross-country run. She had trailed Schoneborn through most of the day and started the run needing to make up 19 seconds to take gold. She made up half the time on her first lap, but the gap was still too wide to close. </p> <p>Her silver meant British women have won four medals in the modern pentathlon in the last three Olympics. The three previous medallists, Stephanie Cook, Kate Allenby and Georgina Harland had gathered together at Allenby's house in the UK to watch Fell and her team-mate Katy Livingston compete on TV. Allenby, who won bronze at Sydney in 2000, has been a particular influence on Fell. Both athletes are from Tavistock, in Devon, and it was Allenby's parents who taught Fell how to ride and shoot. </p> <p>It was moving back to Tavistock, to live, practise and work that got Fell to Beijing. In 2006, while she was training at Bath University, her funding was cut because a series of shin injuries had prevented her from competing. \"I couldn't afford to live in Bath and basically wasn't welcome there, so I went back home to make a decision about what to do next.\" </p> <p>She took up three part-time jobs, as a swimming coach, a barmaid and a physiotherapist, and returned to training at the pony club run by the Allenbys. Fell is not bitter about the funding cut, or at least she is not now she has a medal, saying: \"To be honest, it gave me the kick up the arse I needed.\" When she qualified for Beijing last summer her funding was restored. </p> <p>The modern pentathlon, designed by Pierre de Coubertin to reflect the skills required by 19th-century military officers, is very hard to practise. Fell did not just have to fit her running, swimming and riding around those three jobs but had to travel to Bath for shooting and fencing. She admits she had to put the last two \"on the back-burner\" while she was working her way towards qualification. </p> <p>If she had not been forced to do that, she might easily have taken the gold. After the morning's shooting she was in sixth place, having scored 185 out of a possible 200. Livingston was 19th. Neither was especially strong in the fencing, the most demanding event, requiring each athlete to fight 35 times in three hours. </p> <p>Fell won 20 of her bouts, which put her in joint-third place overall. Livingston, her performances in the three remaining events eventually pushing her up to seventh, was back in 20th. By that point Schoneborn had established a healthy 60-point lead over the field. </p> <p>Ninety minutes after the fencing the pentathletes lined up for the 200m freestyle swim. It was Fell's outstanding event of the day. Her time of 2:12:77 was the third quickest and made her one of five swimmers to break the Olympic record in the discipline. While Schoneborn's swimming was weaker than that of either of the two Britons, it was not so poor as to threaten her position. </p> <p>The fastest time in the event came from the United States' Sheila Taormina, who won a gold medal in the 4x100m relay in 1996; she trimmed some six seconds off the Olympic record to finish in 2:08:86. Having competed in the triathlon at Sydney, Taormina became the first woman in history to take part in three different sports at three different Games. Her lack of ability with the \u00e9p\u00e9e meant she was out of contention for the medals, though she was one of only three riders to produce a flawless round in the showjumping. </p> <p>That was just the kind of performance Fell needed to challenge Schoneborn, but with the horses being randomly allocated from the stable, Fell was unlucky to get the only animal described as \"lazy\" in the official guide. She rode excellently in the circumstances but was still disappointed to topple two fences. Schoneborn extended her lead once more with a round in which she picked up just a single penalty. That made gold for Fell nearly impossible but, considering how close she once came to quitting altogether, she was clearly delighted to have silver.</p>",
  "<p>As the economy slumps, high street spending has been increasing. Figures released yesterday from the Office for National Statistics show a zero growth rate in the three months to June, and it looks as if growth for the whole of 2008 might be as low as 1.2%. Yet last month out we went on a national spending spree, loading up with computer games, mobile phones, electrical goods, digital gizmos, clothes and food. Should we be surprised? No. Britain is truly a nation of shoppers. Even our burgeoning obsession with the superficially high-minded notion of \"urban regeneration\" is based, gung-ho property development aside, on the prevalence of an ever-expanding retail sector that is increasingly a primary focus of British life. Our collective role, it seems, is to nurture this promiscuous shopping frenzy that colours the core of our economy like the garish dyes running through a stick of seaside rock.</p> <p>While many people might well shop ever more frenetically as some form of therapy, for gratification and for simply something to do, the thought that we have allowed ourselves to become, increasingly, a nation primarily of consumers rather than producers is a disturbing one. Getting and spending, and spending some more on things we quickly bore of and throw away, as if we were toddlers chucking infant toys from a buggy, brings little happiness and less contentment. Disaffected youngsters hanging idly around town squares claiming to be \"bored\", depressed families living on benefits from generation to generation in towns stripped of industry and hope, an ever-increasing national reliance on 24-hour booze and drugs, an epidemic of borrowing to buy ever more Christmas puppy-like things that no one really wants, an unhealthy obsession with \"brands\", cheap holidays, disposable electronic gadgets, environmentally destructive supermarkets and airconditioned shopping malls are all symptoms of the fact that a society that consumes as if this was all that mattered is an unhappy one.</p> <p>The making of interesting things, however, can make people content and even happy. Whether whittling a piece of wood, crafting a piece of furniture, building a locomotive, aircraft or ship, or even a house, there is a quiet satisfaction in doing a job well, of creating something unpackaged and unbranded with your own hands. And yet, over the past quarter of a century, Britain has blithely given up the idea of an economy and a society rooted in the making of things. We rely on well-paid Europeans to make costly and sophisticated machinery for us - the Germans, Italians, French and Finns all appear to enjoy making heavy-duty machines and goods - while lowly paid workers in the developing world make most of the cheap stuff, the clothes and digital gizmos we chase after, before moving on to the next gimcrack gewgaw.</p> <p>We even find jobs like plumbing, building and decorating difficult, expecting foreigners to come and do these things for us on the cheap, even as we abuse them, and while we are at it, we expect other poorly paid immigrants to drive our buses, sweep our streets, clean our lavatories, and generally to serve and nurse us for a pittance while we shop, and shop some more.</p> <p>Of course, this is a slightly unfair view of Britain as a whole. The curious thing is that as we become ever more a nation of consumers, in order to balance this phenomenon, we put increasing effort into creative hobbies. While Chinese pick cockles for us in danger of their lives and refugees from what was the eastern bloc tend our fields, we cherish allotments. We bring old railways back to life with gleaming trains in better condition than pretty much any of those you might ride on the nation's crudely profiteering main lines. We restore classic British cars even as we refuse to make our own, although we are happy if car factories can be bought and run by Germans, Japanese and Indians. </p> <p>Nothing of the florid talk of Britain becoming a \"service economy\", a \"post-industrial\" or \"knowledge-based\" society seems to have made this country happier, healthier or more content than it was half a century ago. Is it really more satisfying to read a banal script over the phone to disgruntled customers at the desk of a call centre, or to stack shelves in a supermarket, than to build a modern ship or aircraft? And, if Boris Johnson is keen on handsome new MkII Routemasters for London's streets, who is going to make them? Not us. We don't make buses. We shop around for them instead. </p> <p>An economy sailing too close to the wind on the stormy seas of financial services is, in any case, in perennial danger of sinking when the economic tides turn rough, as they have in recent months, while the fanciful \"knowledge-based\" economy is only really enjoyable for those with a particular turn of mind or educational background. Art, as the Sri Lankan philosopher, Ananda Coomaraswamy - a great influence in Britain between the two world wars - liked to say, is \"the well making of what needs making\". Every person is a special kind of artist. Or could and can be if only work is productive, useful and fulfilling.</p> <p>While ever more people enjoy making things in their spare time and in retirement, equally, ever more people employed to work enjoy increasingly less opportunity to make anything whatsoever (aside from phone calls). And it is one thing to be a skilled professional working elegantly at some agreeable job in a Georgian or Richard Rogers-designed office, another to be an unskilled worker paid ungenerously to swipe branded goods through an electronic checkout inside a uniformly lit building rushed up with neither the remotest love of architecture nor craftsmanship.</p> <p>The more we become a nation of avid and insatiable consumers, the more our towns will lose whatever distinct qualities they once enjoyed as places where specific and special things were made. They are all fast becoming giant, environmentally unfriendly shopping malls. Identical. Cynical. Branded and chained, these are the stuff of an unspoken and unofficial nurturing of a \"bread and circuses\" way of life aimed at keeping our post-industrial economy wobbling along, as we shop till we drop the last spanner in the last British workshop. And, then - disgruntled - shop some more.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Jonathan Glancey is the Guardian's architecture critic </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:jonathan.glancey@theguardian.com\">jonathan.glancey@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Yesterday's figures showing that the economy ground to a halt in the second quarter of the year - as compared with growth of 0.2% in provisional figures - is bad news for Gordon Brown and for all of us. It ends an unprecedented period in Britain's recent economic history during which the output of the economy has expanded for 63 successive quarters and brings the spectre of a recession nearer. The way things are going, the UK will count itself lucky if it escapes with only two quarters of negative growth, the usual definition of a recession. Recent statistics have been almost remorselessly bad: unemployment is up, business investment down, manufacturers much more gloomy, the housing market still very depressed despite a recent mild recovery - and the credit crunch goes on like a continuous descant in the background. It is no consolation that the rest of Europe seems to be accompanying the UK into economic stagnation.</p> <p>If you believe official statistics, one of the few bright spots is the volume of retail spending which is reported to have surged by 0.8% last month to 2.1% above a year earlier. If this buoyancy were real and sustainable then the economy might avoid a recession. The problem is that the British Retail Consortium, which represents much of the industry, does not believe the figures. Its own surveys point to falling sales year-on-year. Part of the explanation may be that people are buying cheaper substitutes to offset the impact of rising food prices on their living standards. According to the research firm TNS, two of the UK's big three discount food chains, Aldi and Lidl (the other is Netto), boosted sales by almost 20% and 12% respectively in the quarter to August. No recession for them. Two of these are not members of the retail consortium and the organisation will not say whether they took part in the confidential survey which, it emphasises, is a representative sample. In any case, the three discount stores account for barely 6% of retail sales, so even if they were not included, it would not make a significant difference to the outcome.</p> <p>It is undoubtedly sensible to switch to cheaper alternatives on the high street, just as it is to drive more slowly to offset higher petrol prices. But this cannot disguise the fact that, with inflation rising and earnings slowing, it is well-nigh impossible to avoid a squeeze on living standards. The only question is how long it will last before exports or business confidence revive. As Lombard Street Research pointed out yesterday, UK firms outside the financial sector are flush with cash and well-placed to lead a recovery when it comes. The question is how long that will be and whether continuous pessimism will feed on itself to make a bad situation worse. In the exceptional circumstances of the moment - with rising food and energy prices piled on top of a global credit crunch - an outcome of a couple of quarters of negative growth might look as if we are getting off lightly. Not for Mr Brown, who built his reputation on sound economic management and who, on more than one occasion, pledged to abolish the trade cycle in order to escape from the stop-go economics that had tarnished past Labour governments. </p> <p>There is an optimistic scenario - that the economy narrowly avoids two quarters of contraction for the next 12 -18 months when falling inflation revitalises spending power. Until then there is not much Mr Brown can do unless he throws caution to the wind by spending enhanced oil revenues on priorities such as social housing. But there is something the Bank of England can do. If it is confident that inflation will fall significantly once the recent rises in food and energy costs pass through the system, then it should cut interest rates now because changes in monetary policy take many months to filter through to the economy. The excuses for not doing so are wearing thinner and thinner as each new statistic is published.</p>",
  "<p>I am sure that in the story of Adam and Eve, the forbidden fruit was a fig and not an apple, pear or anything else. The characteristics of a ripe fig (which is technically more flower than fruit) - its soft, almost rotting juicy centre, its sweet aromas and gooey-crunchy textures - give it the classic erotic associations. But it is exactly this sensual yet sloppy consistency that also puts some people off. I have to admit that I can't take a whole fig and eat it on its own, as I would a peach or mango. It's just too much.</p> <p>However, in conjunction with other things, the fig is the most incredible fruit, worthy of its special, mythological status. In particular, it benefits from aromas of sweet spices, such as cinnamon or anise, or from being paired with citrus flavours. The sweet richness is also well balanced by salt and fat, so it is often served with rich cheeses or cured meats - the best thing you can do with a voluptuous, black Italian fig, say, is wrap it with well-aged Parma ham and tuck in.</p> <p>Italian, French and Turkish figs are available, intermittently, until late autumn. Unfortunately, they have a short shelf life, so supermarkets tend to shy away and keep a minimal stock. The ones they do sell are often Brazilian and have been picked way too early. This makes them hard and tasteless - I would rather not use figs at all than have those.</p> <p>However, some markets and speciality stores sell good, ripe figs. Go for plump fruit with an irregular shape. Pressing against the skin should result in some resistance, but not much. Try to smell the sweetness. Or just close your eyes and follow your sensual instincts.</p> <h2>Marinated quails with fig and herb salad</h2> <p>In my restaurant in Islington, quail often appears on the dinner menu. Its size and succulent flesh are perfect for tapas-style dining, where different small dishes are shared and aren't necessarily hot once everybody gets to them. You can double this recipe to turn it into a main course and serve with something neutral - boiled baby potatoes, say, fork-mashed with their skins on and drizzled with olive oil.</p> <p>The quail need to have their backbone and ribs removed, and then be flattened (or butterflied). This is fiddly, so I recommend you ask your butcher for assistance. Alternatively, use chicken thighs with the bone removed. Makes four starter-size portions.</p> <p><strong>\u00be tsp cardamom pods</strong></p> <p><strong>1 tsp fennel seeds</strong></p> <p><strong>1 tsp ground turmeric</strong></p> <p><strong>100g dried figs, roughly chopped</strong></p> <p><strong>80ml sunflower oil</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00bd garlic clove</strong></p> <p><strong>3cm piece fresh ginger, peeled</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00bd tbsp maple syrup</strong></p> <p><strong>3 tbsp water, plus extra if needed</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00be tsp coarse sea salt</strong></p> <p><strong>4 medium quail, butterflied</strong></p> <p>For the salad</p> <p><strong>50g freshly picked mixed herb leaves: parsley, tarragon, dill, mint, basil (any combination will do)</strong></p> <p><strong>6 medium fresh figs, ripe and sweet, quartered</strong></p> <p><strong>Coarse sea salt and black pepper</strong></p> <p><strong>1 tsp pomegranate molasses</strong></p> <p><strong>1 tbsp lemon juice</strong></p> <p><strong>garlic clove, crushed</strong></p> <p><strong>2\u00bd tbsp olive oil</strong></p> <p>Start by making the marinade for the quail. Place the cardamom pods and fennel seeds in a small pan and toast on the stove top over a high heat for about two minutes, or until they begin to pop. Transfer to a pestle and mortar and work to a fine powder, removing the cardamom skins at the end (alternatively, use ready-ground spices; they aren't that bad).</p> <p>Place the spices in a small food processor bowl, add the turmeric, figs, oil, garlic, ginger, maple syrup, water and salt, and work to a paste. This may take a few minutes, depending on how dry the figs are; you may need to add a little extra water. You want a paste with a spreadable consistency.</p> <p>Rub the paste into the quails' flesh. You don't need to get a perfect coating and you'll end up with some bits that don't stick to the meat. Put these, plus the birds, in a bowl, cover and put in the fridge to marinade for an hour or, preferably, overnight.</p> <p>When ready to cook, spread the quail on a flat oven tray (put any loose bits of marinade under the birds) and place under a hot grill for 10-12 minutes. Turn over once towards the end of the cooking time.</p> <p>Meanwhile, toss the herb leaves and figs with some salt and pepper. Pile this up on four small serving plates. Whisk together the molasses, lemon juice, garlic and oil, and trickle about a tablespoonful over each salad portion. Place the hot quail and loose marinade alongside and serve.</p> <h2>Sugared figs with cheese and pink peppercorns</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336871156\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2008/08/22/ColinCampbell22.jpg\" alt=\"USE ONLY WITH ORIGINAL ARTICLE\" width=\"140\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><br>An extravagant way to open a meal: luscious figs, lemony syrup, perfumed peppercorns and deep-flavoured cheese. It is essential that you go for a great cheese, not a standard one. I tried the recipe with two, English ragstone and crottin de chavignol from the Loire - both worked well, as would a good sheep's milk cheese, such as a semi-mature pecorino. Don't worry if you can't find pink peppercorns -the recipe works just fine without them. Serves four.</p> <p><strong>12 ripe figs</strong></p> <p><strong>60ml lemon juice</strong></p> <p><strong>25ml water</strong></p> <p><strong>50g mild honey</strong></p> <p><strong>90g caster sugar</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00bc tsp salt</strong></p> <p><strong>10 sprigs of thyme</strong></p> <p><strong>250g goat's or ewe's cheese, at room temperature</strong></p> <p><strong>1 tsp pink peppercorns, some whole and some roughly broken with the side of a knife</strong></p> <p>Remove the end of the figs' stalks and cut a cross-shaped incision halfway down the fruit.</p> <p>Put the lemon juice, water, honey, sugar, salt and thyme into a small saucepan and bring up to a gentle simmer. Poach the figs in the syrup, three to four at time, for about two minutes for every batch. You need to stir them gently in the bubbling syrup until they are soft but don't disintegrate. Remove the figs from the syrup and allow them, and the syrup, to cool down completely.</p> <p>To serve, place three figs on a serving plate with a few chunks of cheese alongside. Dribble a little cooking syrup over the top and sprinkle the figs with peppercorns.</p> <h2>Fig, yogurt and almond cake with (or without) extra figs</h2> <p>Serve this on its own, with a cup of tea, but do also make a fully-fledged dessert dish with the figgy accompaniment - it doesn't take much extra effort. Serves eight to 10.</p> <p><strong>200g unsalted butter</strong></p> <p><strong>200g caster sugar, plus 1 tsp extra</strong></p> <p><strong>3 large free-range eggs</strong></p> <p><strong>180g ground almonds</strong></p> <p><strong>100g plain flour</strong></p> <p><strong>\u00bd tsp salt</strong></p> <p><strong>Scraped seeds of \u00bd vanilla pod</strong></p> <p><strong>1 tsp ground star anise</strong></p> <p><strong>100g Greek yogurt</strong></p> <p><strong>12 figs</strong></p> <p>For the extra figs</p> <p><strong>3 tbsp caster sugar</strong></p> <p><strong>6 tbsp red wine</strong></p> <p><strong>6 ripe figs, quartered</strong></p> <p><strong>Greek yogurt</strong></p> <p>Heat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6. Line the bottom and sides of a 24cm loose-based cake tin with baking parchment. Put the butter and sugar in an electric mixer bowl, and use a beater to work them well until they turn light and pale. Beat the eggs lightly, then, with the machine on medium speed, add them gradually to the bowl, just a dribble at a time, adding more only once the previous addition is fully incorporated. Once all the egg is in, mix together the almonds, flour, salt, vanilla and anise, and fold into the batter. Mix until the batter is smooth, then fold in the yogurt.</p> <p>Pour the batter into the lined tin and level roughly with a palette knife or a spoon. Cut each fig vertically into four long wedges, and arrange in circles on top of the cake, just slightly immersed in the batter. Bake for 15 minutes, then reduce the temperature to 170C/340F/gas mark 3 and continue baking until it sets - about 40-45 minutes longer. Check this by inserting a skewer in the cake: it's done if it comes out clean. Remove the cake from the oven and allow it to cool down before taking it out of the tin and sprinkling with a teaspoon of caster sugar. </p> <p>You can eat the cake just as it is, but the addition of warm, syrupy figs turns it into something very special. Once the cake is cool enough, divide it into portions. Put three tablespoons of caster sugar in a medium saucepan and put on a high heat until the sugar starts to caramelise. Remove from the heat, carefully add the wine - it will spit a bit - then return to the heat and let the caramel dissolve in the wine. Add the fig quarters and quickly toss them around just to warm them up. Spoon a generous dollop of Greek yogurt over each slice of cake, plus a few warm figs and their juice. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Ottolenghi: The Cookbook is published by Ebury Press at \u00a325.

  "<h2>Ziani's</h2> <p><strong>45 Radnor Walk, London SW3, 020-7351 5297</strong></p> <p>My boyfriend, Charlie, took me here on our first date - it's a long-time favourite of his family's. The food is Italian with a Venetian influence, like the calves' liver with onions and red wine vinegar. But my favourite order is the chicken breast stuffed with mozzarella, salami and mushrooms.</p> <h2>Ma Bo</h2> <p><strong>16 Nelson Street, Liverpool, 0151-709 4551</strong></p> <p>I grew up eating at this family-run Chinese - my mum and dad used to take us here when we were kids. It's a no-frills kind of place, with duck and pork hanging in the window, and a small, open kitchen at the front. The food's phenomenal - my usual order's the wonton char siu noodle soup. I've been to Beijing many times, but I have to say I think the food here is better.</p> <h2>Taman Gang</h2> <p><strong>Park Lane, London W1, 020-7518 3160</strong></p> <p>I'd have anything off Taman Gang's menu, but I particularly love the small dishes, such as the beef and foie gras gyoza. Good celeb-spotting, too - the last time I was there, so were Kylie and Dannii Minogue, and Naomi Campbell. And the decor is super-cool - I was in the toilets for half an hour because I couldn't work out how to open the door. Even if you don't plan on eating, it's worth dropping by just to have a cocktail and check out the toilets.</p> <h2>St John</h2> <p><strong>Sir Thomas Hotel, 24 Sir Thomas Street, Liverpool, 0151-236 1366</strong></p> <p>St John does the best chateaubriand - the beef is grass fed and hung for 40 days. And they serve a great Eton Mess, my favourite ever dessert.</p> <h2>Hamilton's</h2> <p><strong>The Met Quarter, Whitechapel, Liverpool, 0151-236 7727</strong></p> <p>I'm happy to admit this is co-owned by my friend and fellow Atomic Kitten Natasha Hamilton. It's an all-day dining venue, very stylish, with good, informal food. I love the steak with red onions, or the baked potatoes, and they've a fabulous ros\u00e9 cava.</p> <h2>Hotel du Vin &amp; Bistro</h2> <p><strong>One Devonshire Gardens, Glasgow, 0141-339 2001</strong></p> <p>Whenever I'm in Glasgow, I always try to eat here. The last time I went, my boyfriend and I loved each other's starters so much that, at the end of the meal, instead of pudding, we swapped our starter orders and had them again - his scallops for me, my game terrine for him. They were beautiful.</p> <p>\u00b7 Liz McClarnon is the winner of the BBC's Celebrity MasterChef 2008</p>",
  "<p><strong>Push yourself</strong> Reached a plateau with your running? \"The most effective way of getting fitter faster is threshold training,\" says Nick Anderson, GB endurance and cross-country coach (fullpotential.co.uk). \"That's when you run at 80% to 85% effort at the threshold of aerobic, about to tip into anaerobic, and able to say maybe three words at a time if you tried to talk. Do this at least once a week, either for a whole run or for intervals during it.\"</p> <p><strong>Lean forward</strong> \"The optimum running position is leaning slightly forward, but with your whole body, not just your shoulders,\" says Anderson. \"This relies on having strong core-stability muscles, so supplement running with Pilates.\"</p> <p><strong>Get the right shoes </strong>A 2008 study showed that people who overpronate (roll their feet inwards) tend to do so more as their distance increases, but this is stopped by wearing motion-control shoes. \"But once you have the right shoes, don't fixate on the angle at which your feet land,\" says Anderson. \"Instead, focus on landing lightly, hearing as little noise as possible from your feet hitting the ground.\"</p> <p><strong>Start slowly</strong> If you're new to running, take it easy at first by walk/running until you've built up fitness. Among recreational runners, novices are most at risk of injury, according to a 2008 study in the British Journal Of Sports Medicine.</p> <p><strong>Stretch it out</strong> Gone are the days of a pre-run stretch. \"Never stretch before a run as your muscles, ligaments and tendons are cold,\" says Anderson. \"After an easy run, stretch immediately. After a longer run, leave it a few hours. There will be microscopic tears in your muscles, so it's best to give them a little time to heal before stretching.\"</p>",
  "<h2>Monday February 11 2008</h2> <p> 5.30pm: Dad is bent over the toilet bowl with a brush in his hand and a scowl on his face. I walk up to him. \"Shall I give you a hand?\" Dad begins to snigger, abandoning any attempt to make sense of the situation. We stand shoulder to shoulder with our backs to Mum, who paces around the landing with a newly fitted catheter in her hand. </p> <p>The catheter has been put in by nurse Marianne to enable our GP, who will be with us in half an hour, to give Mum a lethal injection. But instead of having a moment of peace with us, as Marianne suggested, Mum demands that we clean the toilets. Both upstairs and downstairs. </p> <p>My brother, Maarten, is sitting on the edge of the bath, staring out of the bathroom window. </p> <p>\"Imagine,\" he mutters. \"Her last hour, spent like this.\" </p> <p>This is the Netherlands, where voluntary euthanasia is permitted, as well as physician-assisted suicide. This is the day my mother has chosen to die, and the toilets need to be spotless. </p> <h2>Three months earlier</h2> <p>I'm on a writer's retreat in the UK, where I have been living for the past three years. I'm working on my novel when my mobile phone rings. The display shows it's Maarten, calling from the Netherlands. Mum's test results have come back. </p> <p>\"It's secondary cancer in her lungs.\" He pauses. \"They reckon she's got two to six months left.\"</p> <p>I phone Mum. She talks without interruption, barely taking breath, about quitting her job just two months before her retirement, about what might have happened if she had not had that innocent-looking polyp removed from her womb, about why the doctors had not investigated her lungs earlier. </p> <p>The prognosis is she could live another year if she undergoes chemotherapy. But she won't. \"I'm not going to go bald,\" she says. \"I don't want people saying, 'How sad, that beautiful hair all gone.' Never.\" </p> <p>When I phone again, she sounds as if she doesn't have time to talk. </p> <p>\"I'm arranging my cremation.\" </p> <p>\"Oh ... \"</p> <p>\"Yes, the text for the card, the location, the flowers, the coffin ... I'm really busy.\" </p> <p>Dad, Maarten and I do not seem to be part of the equation. </p> <h2>Late January 2008</h2> <p> Dad phones. After two and a half months, Mum is deteriorating rapidly. She suffers from headaches, sickness and loss of coordination. She takes a fall while Dad is having a shower. When she has a shower, half the bathroom floor gets flooded. </p> <p>Two days later, brain metastasis is confirmed. Mum is hospitalised and given drugs to repress the inflammation, but they will only remain effective for a week or two.</p> <h2>Friday January 25</h2> <p> Maarten collects me from Schiphol airport in Amsterdam and we drive to meet Dad at the hospital. We all go upstairs together. </p> <p>Mum is sitting by herself at a table near the window as we enter. She throws us a tearful smile. \"My boys,\" she says, as Maarten and I give her a hug. \"To think that this all started in that bloody womb of mine ... but I am glad I had it, to bear you two.\" </p> <p>The hospital staff all do a great job and Mum seems content with her care. After two hours with us, though, she becomes more demanding. She asks Dad to put things into her bag, then take them out again. She snaps when he can't find her mobile phone. </p> <p>When the palliative care coordinator, Carola, comes in to discuss the option of home care, I take Dad outside. \"Dad, I'm wondering - here, Mum is in the capable hands of staff whose authority she accepts. At home, she'll just try to be the boss.\" </p> <p>\"Hmm. You may be right,\" says Dad. We walk back, just as Mum is asking Carola whether home care really does not include vacuuming. </p> <p>When I repeat my concerns to Maarten, though, he is adamant: \"She ought to come home. It feels more natural if she dies there and I want to be around her for a bit. I don't want to drive to this depressing hospital every day and leave her alone at night.\" </p> <p>And so the question is settled. The four of us will go home together on Monday. </p> <h2>Saturday January 26</h2> <p> In Dad's study, I find a draft version of a mourning card saying \"dag lief\" (\"bye dear\"). My name is on the card, along with my brother's and Dad's. These are meant to be our words, but I have had no part in writing them and I struggle with the bottom line: \"We prefer not to receive telephone calls, visitors or flowers.\" </p> <h2>Monday January 28</h2> <p> After arriving home with Mum, we struggle to share a harmonious moment. She asks again if we've thought about what we are going to say at her funeral. When I answer that I haven't, Mum insists that time is short. I should look at her \"expression of wish\" statement - her wish to die. It needs editing. I go upstairs to the study. </p> <p>The statement begins: \"I, Mieneke Weide-Boelkes, am terminally ill.\" It ends: \"As soon as this medication loses its efficacy I request euthanasia.\" Dad joins me and reassures me the text has genuinely been written by Mum. </p> <p>I start editing. Then Mum calls from downstairs. \"Weren't you going to make dinner?!\" </p> <p>I go downstairs and start cooking with Maarten. Anything for a quiet life ... because that is how it's always been and now is not the time to change it. </p> <p>When dinner is ready and I go to fetch Mum and Dad, I find them sitting in our bedroom with a man I have never seen before. </p> <p>Mum introduces me to the doctor, Martin. He is holding the statement I have just edited, but all I can think is how he got in so quietly and why Mum and Dad have not bothered to let us know he is here.</p> <h2>Wednesday January 30</h2> <p>8.15am: Maarten has a run-in with Mum. He asks what on Earth she is doing with the Hoover at \"stupid o'clock\" in the morning. Mum does not appreciate being spoken to like that. </p> <p>Things still simmer at breakfast. Mum finds fault with all the shopping we bought the previous day: the gouda cheese is too soft, the bread too sweet and why is there fruit juice in her fridge?</p> <h2>Monday February 4</h2> <p>We are just about to have lunch when Mum, who has been complaining about headaches this morning, gets up from the table. Tearfully, she shuffles to the kitchen sink. \"I am so sick of it,\" she says, \"so sick.\" She begins to make retching noises. </p> <p>As Dad gets closer, Mum begins to thrash around. \"It's starting again!\" she cries. \"Call a doctor, quickly!\" </p> <p>Maarten manages to calm her down a little. Dad picks up the phone to call the doctor. Mum wants to go back to the table, but I take her upstairs to bed. </p> <p>A moment later we hear feet shuffling down the stairs. The door opens and Mum appears. \"I'm sort of OK now,\" she says. </p> <p>She has just sat down when the doctor arrives. As he sticks his head round the dining-room door and sees Mum sipping coffee, his face is all surprise. </p> <p>So this is the moment Mum has specified: initial symptoms back; medication losing its effect. </p> <p>The doctor says euthanasia can take place next week. Another doctor first needs to verify, though, that Mum cannot be cured, that her wish to die has been consistent, and that her suffering is unbearable. </p> <p>Martin is convinced of the first two conditions but not of the third. If Mum is too energetic to stay in bed, then how is her suffering unbearable? </p> <p>Mum puts her coffee down. \"Well, I have to die anyway, don't I?\" Then she asks us what we think. </p> <p>I interrupt: \"It should be your own decision. None of us is to say anything.\" </p> <p>But Mum struggles to say she wants to die. Eventually I say, \"I think what she finds unbearable is not so much her pain and sickness, but the fear of it getting worse and of losing control.\" </p> <p>When Martin is finally satisfied that Mum wants to end it, he agrees to contact the second doctor. He leaves with an empathetic nod to us all.</p> <h2>Thursday February 7</h2> <p>I wake up in the middle of the night. Mum is standing in our bedroom. She opens a drawer and takes something out. She shuffles items across the desk until she is pleased with their arrangement. Then she leaves, quietly closing the door behind her. </p> <p>It is at least the third nocturnal bout of tidying up I've seen this fortnight.</p> <p>Mum's youngest sister and her husband are visiting today. Everybody sits at the dining-room table with drinks and nibbles. Mum is giving an animated demonstration on how to polish silverware with her special gloves. </p> <p>Then the secondary opinion doctor phones to say he will be with us in 10 minutes. There is a brief panic. Mum wants to change into her nightwear and get into bed before the doctor arrives, but we persuade her otherwise. </p> <p>The doctor speaks privately with Mum in the dining room. After he leaves, Mum looks decisive. She says it was \"a very good talk\", but does not give any further details.</p> <p>Later, when the guests have gone, Dad tells me that the doctor asked him to leave the room. \"Yes,\" Mum interrupts, \"the doctor had to ascertain if I was not being forced into euthanasia.\"</p> <h2>Friday February 8</h2> <p>Doctor Martin is due to come in the afternoon to discuss further plans, but I do not see him. My brother has to fill me in over the phone because I am staying at a friend's after a fight with Mum. </p> <p>Over the last week or so, she has been complaining about my shoes and the damage they do to her floor and has been badgering me to buy a new pair at her preferred shop this weekend. </p> <p>\"Mum,\" I say, \"I was planning to stay with some friends this weekend.\" </p> <p>\"Oh, were you!\" she snaps. \"And who has got more priority then, your friends or your terminally ill mother?\" </p> <p>I decide to go sooner rather than later. But Mum pursues me as I get my things. \"Why don't you stay with your friends next week, when I'm dead? You'll have all the time in the world then!\" </p> <p>\"I was planning to spend time here, with Dad.\" </p> <p>\"Oh no you won't,\" she says. \"When I'm dead, it's just going to be your dad and me here. I don't want you and Maarten around. And anyway, you don't do diddly squat ... \" </p> <p>I lose my self-control. I shout and swear at her and storm off in a rage. </p> <p>Later, at my friend Petra's, I get a phone call from Maarten about the outcome of the doctor's visit. Mum's death has been scheduled for Monday February 11, at 6.15pm.</p> <h2>Sunday February 10</h2> <p>Mum's sisters and their husbands are there for a last family dinner, together with Dad, Maarten and me - wearing my expensive new pair of shoes. Mum, even more energetic than the week before, decorates the table lavishly. </p> <p>My uncles shake their heads with incomprehension. As Mum shows off her china plates, my aunts have distracted looks on their faces. </p> <p>Whispering to Dad and me in the hallway, they struggle to understand why Mum is choosing to die the next day when she is bouncing around like a 40-year-old instead of a terminally ill 65-year-old. But there is also shock at her fixation on material objects and the little interest she shows in how the people around her actually feel.</p> <h2>Monday February 11</h2> <p>Again, I wake up early when Mum comes into the bedroom. It is disturbing to see her take the stones and shells from the windowsill and place them on the desk. She had only moved them on to the windowsill the previous morning. </p> <p>Mum leaves and comes back again three times. After the last visit, I can hear she is hoisting the vacuum cleaner up to the attic. It is just after 6am. </p> <p>It is the start of an increasingly mad day, during which Mum hoovers the whole house and does six loads of washing (one of which consists of a single white shirt). She scrapes all the woodwork on the outside of the house clear of moss and cleans the windows. </p> <p>After breakfast, I find Dad fuming after Mum has given him grief for not ironing fast enough. I ask him if it helps to see her as a mental patient instead of his wife. He grumbles. </p> <p>I think of what was said the night before, about Mum's relative physical fitness and her obsession with material objects and cleanliness. I feel an increasing tension as the day progresses and I still don't know whether it is going to be Mum's last. </p> <p>I overhear Mum's conversation with the flower shop. After the crematorium confirms the date of her funeral, she phones to order flowers for her coffin. It is an hour and a half before the nurse comes to put the catheter into Mum's hand. </p> <p>6.15pm: The doctor arrives shortly after the scene with the toilets. Mum greets him, then disappears upstairs, saying, \"Best let me potter for a bit.\" Nobody sees her for another 20 minutes.</p> <p>\"Does it happen at all that people pull out at the last minute?\" I ask. </p> <p>\"Yes,\" Martin says. \"Quite often I go home again and a new appointment is made. But in many cases the patient passes away between visits.\" </p> <p>When Mum comes back, listing things she has put in bags and boxes, Martin gently interrupts her: \"Can I just ask you something? Is there still a lot you feel you need to do?\" </p> <p>\"Yes,\" she says, \"I mean no. I'm just nervous.\" </p> <p>\"I can always come back later if you are not ready,\" says the doctor. </p> <p>Mum sits down and listens to the doctor. Then she takes a deep breath and says, \"OK. I am ready.\" </p> <p>At 7pm, with my father, brother and me around her bed as well as Martin, who has given her the injection, Mum goes to sleep. </p> <h2>Saturday February 16</h2> <p> People at funerals often say that the deceased would have approved of the ceremony. In my mother's case, she had literally approved everything - the music, the flowers, the guest list and the restaurant we went to afterwards.</p> <p>My main regret is that there were such clashes between us in the run-up to her death. Perhaps if we had challenged Mum more over the years, keeping her ever-increasing demands in check, we could have been at peace as a family, instead of at war over shoes and toilets, right to the bitter end.</p>",
  "<p>\"I think we go up there,\" says Tim, pointing up a muddy track. \"They never mentioned that,\" I say, grumpily. \"I'm right,\" he cries, spotting a tiny painted sign stuck in the ground (it's like a cartoon sign, which usually says \"Mind the cliff\", before a character hurtles over it). </p> <p>Instead of a cliff we find stunning gardens, a tall house and, across a carpet of lawn, outbuildings beside a smooth, asphalt car park. Clearly we should be over there, but Clow Beck's award-winning garden is in the way.</p> <p>We leave the gardens and spot a \"reception\" sign. Now we're in a restaurant with a stone fireplace, and set tables of encouragingly different sizes. Not just couples sitting in sepulchral silence here, then. </p> <p>The owners, Heather and David Armstrong, appear. \"You didn't come in that way? Oh, no ...\" They explain with amusement that we've missed the proper driveway and taken the old one. \"Satnav?\" David asks. \"Not exactly,\" I reply, shooting Tim a look. </p> <p>Although Clow Beck House (\"Clow\" is pronounced as in \"how\" and the beck runs into the river Tees), calls itself a small hotel, it feels homely, like a B&amp;B. The Armstrong family live in the main building, the 13 guest rooms are in the original house - a 30s bungalow - and those rustic-looking annexes across the garden (in fact, they are purpose-built). </p> <p>We bring the car round. David whisks bags into our room, Heather's offering tea, though we have tea things - ooh, and biscuits - in our ground floor twin. I like our arched stone porch - rather continental - and the Chinese bedheads. We also have a small sofa and telly, well-proportioned bathroom (shower over the bath) with plentiful Penhaligon's toiletries and even an inflatable bath pillow. Hang on, what's through the other door? A tiny dressing room, with an iron, mini fridge, cotton wool and nail polish remover. </p> <p>Despite having man flu, Tim's been quick off the mark with a tiny gold box which says \"Welcome to Clow Beck House\". By the time I spot it, the contents are one chocolate down. </p> <p>Leaving him to his Lemsip, I walk along the beck to its confluence with the Tees. What a heavenly spot. </p> <p>Then it's dinner. \"I'd like all of it,\" says Tim nasally over a menu which seems to dare us to make utter pigs of ourselves. \"If it's too fancy, plain food's no problem,\" says a line at the bottom. We'll take the fancy stuff, thank you, like creamy sweet red onion soup and hot smoked salmon and crayfish tails with prawns in seafood sauce. \"In winter we serve braden rost with a whisky sauce,\" Heather tells us. </p> <p>\"They love their food here, don't they?\" says Tim over \"amazing\" rack of lamb with minted port wine sauce. My fillet steak is from Northallerton, where the butcher hangs his beef for three weeks. Then blackcurrant and raspberry sorbets, which zing with homegrown fruitiness. Wish they sold these in tubs.</p> <p>At breakfast, there is unusual triangular black pudding - from a small producer in Thirsk - on Tim's plate (\"I'm feeding a cold\"), along with Wensleydale back bacon and sausages from Skipton. Teas are from Bettys in Harrogate. It all adds up to a sense of place, of having travelled and finding things you can't at home, which is surely the whole point of going away.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> 01325 721075, <a href=\"http://wwwclowbeckhouse.co.uk\">clowbeckhouse.co.uk, </a>, Croft, near Darlington.

  "<p>I'm driving Mum to the seaside for the weekend. She's out of hospital and the fact that she's no longer tied to heparin injections given by the district nurses means it's easier to take her away. The downside is that the warfarin she is now taking is more difficult to organise and supervise. \"The sea air will be good for you,\" I say. But she's unusually unenthusiastic, so low in energy and mood that I wonder if the hospital's changes to her medication are affecting her badly. </p> <p>\"I'm all disorientated,\" she says constantly. \"I don't know what's wrong with me.\" I've had to work hard to persuade her to come. \"I don't want to go anywhere,\" she says emphatically, only weakening when I plead, \"We'll take you for a crab sandwich and a glass of wine ... we'll go to some country pubs.\"</p> <p>On the journey it's just her and me. We pass a caravan. \"I've never been on holiday in a caravan,\" she says. </p> <p>\"Yes you have,\" I say. \"Don't you remember Dad bought a cronky old one in a pub field?\" I don't add: \"And after the first time we went you refused to go back.\" </p> <p>\"I can't remember a thing,\" she says, ruefully. \"I must be going barmy. It's the only explanation.\" And after a few moments, \"Fancy forgetting all that stuff.\" Pause. \"That was my life.\"</p> <p>In a traffic jam, I glance at my mobile. There's a text message waiting for me from my brother. \"Mum tried to ring me. In rehearsal. Can't deal with it now. Can u check?\" </p> <p>I rapidly text back. \"No probs. We are on our way to sea.\"</p> <p>His text reminds me that he's playing in a Prom and it's being broadcast right now. I tune the radio and encourage Mum to listen. It's Rachmaninov and I point out the moments when I think it's him playing.</p> <p>\"I'm a wicked woman,\" she says, out of the blue. </p> <p>\"What do you mean?\" I ask. </p> <p>\"I just expected you lot to do these things and never gave you a single word of praise.\" </p> <p>Too true, I think. But this isn't the time for recriminations and I'm amazed to hear her say this. She's never said anything like it before. \"I can text him and tell him how much we enjoyed the concert,\" I say. </p> <p>\"Gee whizz,\" she says, ambiguously.</p> <p>The second half of the Prom is Vaughan Williams, and travelling through the Kent countryside I prompt her about childhood holidays, which, given previously she said she didn't remember a thing, she recalls a fair bit about. Her mood is so reflective I wonder if now is the moment to talk to her about the column. It's been some time since I mentioned it. Then she said, \"I don't mind what you write about me.\" But we never mention it and I don't go out of my way to show it to her. I feel too ambivalent and hope she doesn't really remember it. In fact, I'd assumed she doesn't remember a thing about it until recently in hospital, when she suddenly said to one of the doctors: \"You'd better watch what you say or she'll write about you in the Guardian.\" But once again I lose my nerve.</p> <p>Over the weekend, we get to the country pub and also find her a crab sandwich, but most of the time is spent in the same state of low energy and nostalgia. In the garden, I point out the plants and pots she has given me over the years. \"So you have got something to remember me by,\" she says.</p> <p>I bring out lunch. It's under a food cover she bought me once in the Harvey Nicks sale. She's not a Harvey Nicks person but she does like a bargain. For several years now, every time she sees this cover she says, \"That's nice. Did I buy it for you?\" </p> <p>\"Yes,\" I answer. </p> <p>\"Where did I get it?\" she asks. </p> <p>\"Harvey Nicks sale.\" </p> <p>So we go through this routine again, but this time she adds, \"You can remember me by it.\" I take a deep breath. I need to respond to these comments. I need to say something like, \"I'll never forget you.\" But it's not part of our relationship. My heart is beating and I'm struggling to formulate something. Just as I open my mouth, she says, \"Do you think it's sale time now at Harvey Nicks?

  "<h2>How can my son-in-law progress if a full-time course is not an option?</h2> <p><strong>My son-in-law is hoping for a change of direction in his working life. Due to family circumstances, he left school and home when he was only 16. (He had gained a few GCSEs, but only with low grades.) He lived in a bedsit and supported himself by working in various shops. I think his happiest period was when he was working in a bike shop and he undertook bicycle repairs. </strong></p> <p><strong>He is soon to be 25. He has been in his current job at an electrical store for three years, where he is given quite a lot of responsibility. His salary is commission-based and he's doing well. But he really wants to do something different with his life. He would love to undergo some training, gain some qualifications, find employment in which he could really progress. Ideally, he would like to work with animals, or do some other kind of outdoor work.</strong></p> <p><strong>He is intelligent, reliable, conscientious, well-presented, with a pleasant manner. He has proven himself to be a hard worker. But he lacks confidence. Bearing in mind that he needs to pay rent and other living costs, he cannot afford to take up any full-time education. But he needs to improve his prospects. His partner, my daughter, is a trainee teacher and very happy with her chosen path. I feel he needs and deserves to find something fulfilling, too. He is young enough to do something new, he just needs a break.</strong></p> <p>It's a risky business, offering advice on such slender evidence - but here goes. The key, as you clearly feel yourself, seems to lie in his lack of confidence. Through no fault of his own, he left school early with low grades. Neither parent seems to have steered, guided or encouraged him. He took the only jobs that were available - and they were pretty lowly ones. I expect his contemporaries are mostly doing rather better for themselves - and that won't help, either. To his great credit, he hasn't let all this discourage him. He's not railing against the unfairness of things. He's ready for any opportunity.</p> <p>I'm not sure why, but I have a very strong feeling that what he most needs is a sort of father-figure/patron/sponsor: I have in mind, for example, the founder and owner of a small or medium-sized business. But not a conventional business; something like a fish farm, perhaps, or a farm shop, or even a kennels. Because from what you say, I believe your son-in-law, if encouraged and tutored by a solicitous patron, would be the most conscientious and committed of lieutenants. And as he learned and grew, so he'd grow in confidence and become utterly invaluable to his patron and finally feel a real sense of purpose in life.</p> <p>This means, of course, an unconventional form of job-hunting. You'll need to trace these individuals and check them out. You'll all have to help. But it could be just the leg-up your son-in-law needs.</p> <h2>I want a creative job - should I settle for the PA role being offered?</h2> <p><strong>I'm a woman in my mid-20s, and am already facing a bit of a career change, having realised that the subject I studied throughout uni, and have worked in for the past two years, is not for me after all. I wish to go into a related, but ultimately very different field, where I know I could really shine and make a lot of difference. </strong></p> <p><strong>So among the usual networking, I have got back in contact with a recruitment agency that I temped with throughout uni, and who specialise in media, specifically the area I want to be in. However, the agency keeps telling me that I have to be \"flexible\", ie, I have to be prepared to accept a job that is not in the field I wish to go into. Moreover, rather than the creative-focused roles I wish to break into, they want to continue putting me up for PA roles, which I have gained a huge amount from and put a lot of effort into but have learned, frankly, that it is no career choice for me. </strong></p> <p><strong>Am I right to hold out for a job I really want and make the agency work harder to make those opportunities for me? Or should I just settle for another PA job in another industry I don't want to be in? I am at a loss as to what to do; this is the only agency that has responded to me, and I do not wish to close off a valuable avenue by getting a reputation for being awkward about what jobs I will and won't consider. </strong></p> <p>I can't help feeling that the fact that you once temped for this agency is both good news and bad news. Good, because you know each other; and bad because they still remember you as a temp. That could be partially why they're putting you up for PA roles: they haven't been able to readjust to the fact that you're now a graduate with a couple of years' experience behind you.</p> <p>Whatever their reasons, you simply mustn't take the easy way out. Resist the lure of \"flexibility\". Don't settle for anything. Your letter shows a splendid confidence and certainty. After a couple of years in the wrong field, you're now absolutely clear about where you want to go. Don't be persuaded to lose that determination.</p> <p>I suspect you sense that this is a defining moment in your working life. If you don't get it right this time, there may not be another. So please don't worry about earning a reputation for being awkward. Determined people, driven by real conviction, often seem awkward. And it's not your job to make life easy for this recruitment agency. </p> <p>If agencies aren't helpful, try the direct approach. Research the firms you most admire. Communicate your passion to them. Don't be afraid to follow up. You say the roles you're after are \"creative-focused\" - so show some creativity in the way you apply. </p> <p>I realise that making a bit of a nuisance of yourself doesn't come easily to you; but at this crucial moment in your life you may need to adopt a slightly thicker skin. With any luck, it will only be temporary. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> For Jeremy Bullmore's advice on a work issue, send a brief email to <a href=\"mailto:work@theguardian.com\">work@theguardian.com</a>.

  "<p><strong>Allan Horsfall writes: </strong>My gratitude to Leo Abse (Obituary, August 21) is not diminished by the fact that he disliked me. He regarded me not only as a meddler but - much worse - a gay meddler. </p> <p>In 1967 I wrote a letter, published simultaneously in the Spectator and Tribune, objecting to Abse's acquiescence to the exclusion of the merchant navy from the provisions of his sexual offences bill. He wrote to me to say he would be grateful if I would not go sounding off in the papers while he was piloting an important bill through the House.</p> <p>His great fear was that, if the pressure for reform was seen or supposed to be coming from gay men, then his chances of success would vanish. I have no means of knowing if this was true, but his attitude was indicative of the way in which working for gay law reform at that time was like trying to walk on eggshells. </p> <p>However mistaken he might have been, he was respected and listened to, with the consequence that the emergence of a powerful and influential gay movement was much slower than it would otherwise have been.</p>",
  "<p>Drug companies are spending millions of pounds every year on all-expenses-paid trips to conferences around the world for doctors and other hospital staff, in what critics say is a massive marketing exercise dressed up as medical education.</p> <p>The Guardian can reveal the scale of pharmaceutical company sponsorship following an examination of the registers of gifts and donations to doctors that all hospitals are required to keep. They show considerable largesse - from drug companies regularly picking up hefty bills for travel to international conferences in Europe, Asia and America, to specialist nurses' salaries, and weekly sandwich lunches for hospital staff training sessions.</p> <p>All-expenses-paid trips to conferences in the US, Vietnam or Hungary are a regular feature of the registers, costing the companies up to \u00a35,000 per doctor. Many of the declarations by doctors do not put a price on the trip. The total amounts received by staff at individual hospital trusts with complete registers are substantial - Sheffield's staff received funding of more than \u00a3105,000 from pharmaceutical and medical devices companies in the 12 months to last June. </p> <p>Examples of the firms' hospitality include:</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Astra Zeneca paid \u00a32,500 for a doctor at the Royal Bournemouth trust and \u00a31,500 for a doctor at Sheffield teaching hospital to attend a cancer conference in Texas</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Sanofi-Aventis, the world's fourth biggest pharmaceutical company, paid for doctors at the Countess of Chester trust to go to conferences in Cape Town, New Orleans and Barcelona. At Gateshead trust, their reps gave a breakfast for 30 staff \"to discuss drugs for the treatment of breast cancer\". The trust's register records that \"the donor was seeking to secure business\".</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Roche spent \u00a32,000 for an oncology consultant at Addenbrooke's hospital in Cambridge to go to a conference in May last year.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>GSK, the biggest British pharmaceutical company, paid \u00a31,200 for a consultant at Sheffield teaching hospital to attend the 11th international congress of Parkinson's disease and movement disorders in Turkey last June.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Companies have also been taking hospital staff to top football and rugby matches. Carillion, a public sector construction firm, spent \u00a3180 taking a senior manager at Milton Keynes trust to lunch and then a rugby match at Twickenham last August.</p> <p>Most doctors deny that their reliance on drug company cash makes them biased. The pharmaceutical companies argue that they are helping doctors acquire further medical education by funding their trips to conferences in foreign cities, but they refuse to reveal how much they pay out.</p> <p>However, the health select committee warned in a report in 2005 that the industry's sponsorship of doctors and other medical staff had drug promotion as its motive and could lead to unsafe prescribing of drugs such as Vioxx, the arthritis drug which was found to cause heart attacks.</p> <p>Joe Collier, the recently retired professor of medicines policy at St George's hospital, London, a former member of the Medicines Commission and an adviser to the select committee, said: \"Through its orchestrated campaigns affecting all those involved in the use of medicines, the pharmaceutical industry enormously influences what patients are prescribed. On the whole these influences are detrimental to best practice.\" </p> <p>Payments to doctors are far from transparent. The Department of Health requires NHS trusts to compile registers of their medical staff's and directors' possible conflicts of interest and to make them available to the public. Only a minority do so. The Guardian requested the registers for 90 hospital trusts under freedom of information legislation. Only around a quarter returned data that included the names of the doctors and the sponsoring companies and the amounts of money received. Some refused to give any information at all.</p> <p>Collier said this was unacceptable. \"Declarations of interest are a key way to help break the pharmaceutical industry's stranglehold. It is not a trivial issue. Public declarations by doctors are essential if prescribing is to be sensible and appropriate and according to patients' needs.\"</p> <p>Consumers International (CI) said the lack of transparency was unacceptable. \"When a medical professional speaks on a health issue, we assume that they are putting patients' interests first. If that person has a conflict of interest because they or their organisation are receiving funding from a drug company the least we should demand is the right to know about it,\" said Justin Macmullan, head of campaigns. \"Pharmaceutical companies will tell you that what they are funding is medical education. But our concern is that this is really highly effective, well-targeted marketing. This throws any notion of impartiality out of the window and jeopardises a doctor's ability to make an informed, balanced decision about the most appropriate treatments.\"</p> <p>CI wants drug companies to declare how much they give to doctors. \"Countries such as the US and Australia have woken up to this issue and are now requiring pharmaceutical companies to disclose their funding of medical organisations and medical education. European regulators have been sleeping on the job,\" he said.</p> <p>Labour MP Paul Flynn described as \"codswallop\" the companies' claim that their only intention was to help educate doctors. \"It's not true. It's part of a huge marketing budget. It's all about maximising their profits, not helping people in life-threatening situations,\" he said. \"The influence of these companies is enormous.\"</p> <p>Doctors who receive funding believe they are not influenced by it. Robert Storey, a consultant cardiologist at Sheffield involved in drug trials, took four trips to conferences in the year to June 2007 courtesy of Astra Zeneca at a total cost of \u00a312,000. However, he regards these as business trips because he is asked to disseminate research findings and are funded from the R&amp;D budget. More junior doctors have their funding arranged through the drug rep and must fly economy class under Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) rules.</p> <p>\"If it is done through the local rep, who may expect some sort of favour in exchange for that sponsorship, there is more stringent regulation,\" said Dr Storey. \"[Those doctors] are seeing reps on a regular basis and although it is explicitly stated in the ABPI rules that there shouldn't be any conflict or conditions [on the funding], it probably does influence doctors' behaviour because they are unsure whether they will get further sponsorship for going to further meetings, so it is useful to them to engender good relationships with different reps. </p> <p>\"One has to be careful how one judges oneself, but when you get to my level where you are getting a lot of interest from different companies, you can pick and choose to a certain extent. If you feel uncomfortable about any particular request or association, you can very easily walk away. If I'm asked to put certain points across in a talk which I think are biased, I won't do it in the best interests of patient care.\"</p> <p>Storey, who makes a fuller declaration than most doctors, would prefer to see a different system. \"I certainly think it would be preferable if sponsorship or money for travelling to meetings was independent from the pharmaceutical companies but there is no pot of money for providing that,\" he said.</p> <p>Dr Willy Notcutt, an expert in pain relief at James Paget hospital in Great Yarmouth, has recently returned from a big conference in Glasgow. Two companies, Eli Lilly and Boehringer, paid \u00a3800 for his travel, accommodation and registration fee. He says he has been prescribing a drug sold jointly by the two companies but was not \"brainwashed\" into it by their hospitality. He made his own independent evaluation of the merits of the drug. \"I don't give a toss what the drug company rep says. I prescribe drugs which give benefit to my patients,\" he said.</p> <p>The ABPI said doctors would not be able to attend conferences where they hear from experts in their field without sponsorship, but it was important this was transparent.</p>",

  "<p>The chief executive of TNK-BP, Robert Dudley, has complained to Russian authorities about the Moscow labour inspectorate's treatment of the company. In a letter this week to six government organisations, Dudley said the inspectorate's actions could be seen as an abuse of its powers.</p> <p>Last week a Moscow court banned Dudley from working in Russia for two years, linked to breaches of labour laws. Dudley left the country last month, saying he hoped his move would ease the administrative burden on the company.</p> <p>In the letter Dudley said that, since April, the inspectorate had made seven inspections - two scheduled and five unscheduled - to examine the company's compliance with the labour code. \"The fact this number of verification measures has been taken in relation to one company, when there is a developing corporate conflict between the Russian and foreign shareholders of the TNK-BP group ... over a short period of time, provides a basis for concluding that there has been an abuse of power by the state labour inspectorate as well as a possible interest on its part in the outcome of the inspections,\" he said.</p> <p>The letter was addressed to the Federal Service for Employment and Labour Relations and copies sent to other organisations, including the anti-corruption council, the general prosecutor's office and the federal security service.</p> <p>BP, which owns 50% of the company, and four Russian billionaires who own the other 50%, have been at loggerheads for months over its direction and strategy. BP has backed Dudley while the Russian shareholders have sought his removal.</p> <p>In his letter, Dudley criticised officials, insisting he, not the company, was the target. Among his complaints is that the inspectorate refused to postpone a meeting with him scheduled at the same time he was meeting officials from another government organisation in an unsuccessful attempt to extend his visa. </p> <p>He also claims the company was allowed insufficient time to prepare for meetings and to respond to inspection results.</p> <p>The letter asserted, \"all their actions were purposefully focused on imposing [the] administrative liability of RW Dudley alone ... The unambiguous conclusion is that the said officials were carrying out somebody's orders and we request that this be investigated.\"</p> <p>The inspectorate rejected Dudley's claims. \"All the checks that took place at the firm were done by the law,\" said the head of the organisation, Mikhail Malyuga.</p> <p>BP gets a quarter of its oil and gas production from the joint venture but only 10% of its profits. Publicity surrounding the power struggle between BP and Russian shareholders has thrown the spotlight on the country's corporate governance. </p> <p>It has also prompted speculation that the repeated inspections and ban on Dudley could mean a state-controlled entity is interested in TNK-BP as Russia seeks to tighten its grip on its energy sector.</p>",
  "<p>The scale of the task facing the new management at Rentokil Initial was made plain yesterday when chief executive Alan Brown admitted it could take up to five years to restore the business to growth.</p> <p>Brown made the comment as the pest control, hygiene services and transport group reported another slump in earnings with a half-year profit of \u00a339.3m, compared with \u00a388m in the same period a year earlier, a decline of more than 55%.</p> <p>The company slashed its half-year dividend to conserve cash and said further job losses were inevitable.</p> <p>\"We have a lot to do and will have to deliver it in increasingly difficult economic circumstances,\" Brown said. He would be \"surprised and delighted\" if the group recovered within three years but said it was likely to need a \"five-year agenda\" to be fully restored to health.</p> <p>Brown was one of three former ICI executives parachuted into Rentokil in March with the lure of eye-popping salaries and bonuses worth up to \u00a3100m between them if they could triple the share price in five years.</p> <p>Erstwhile ICI chief John McAdam was hired as Rentokil chairman and Andy Ransom brought in as head of business development.</p> <p>Certain incentives kick in if the share price reaches 120p, and more if it hits 180p. The shares yesterday closed 6% lower at 69.25p and the team faces an uphill struggle - last month, Rentokil issued its fourth profit warning in eight months. </p> <p>Rentokil was once regarded as one of Britain's most successful companies, with former boss Sir Clive Thompson earning the sobriquet of \"Mr 20%\" for his ability to keep the business growing at that annual rate. The company has blamed its recent poor performance on the botched integration of a series of acquisitions and some \"poorly executed\" cost-cutting plans under the previous management.</p> <p>Brown said he had been surprised by the \"stench\" beneath some of the rocks he lifted when he first arrived. He said customer service had not been good enough, citing a recent e-mail complaining that a driver from Rentokil's City Link arm had unsuccessfully attempted to deliver a parcel four times at various points in the day, despite the customer saying he would be at home only between 5pm and 7pm.</p> <p>Brown said customer service was now showing \"dramatic\" improvements. \"The crisis is if you are losing customers, and we have resolved that issue almost everywhere,\" he said.</p> <p>The most obvious difficulties were at City Link, which fell to a \u00a329m loss in the first half. Delivery volumes were down 9% in June on the same month last year, partly due to operational problems and partly to the weakening economy, the company said.</p> <p>Brown said there would be a significant improvement in the bottom line at City Link next year, dismissing the suggestion that it should be sold. </p> <p>\"Who is going to want to buy City Link when it is losing money? And who is in the best place to fix it? I am convinced we can do it. In three to four years' time we can think about our portfolio,\" he said.</p> <p>The next focus will be on a programme of cost cutting. Brown said the decision to cut the dividend from 2.13p to 0.65p had been a \"no-brainer\".</p> <p>Group revenue rose 4.8% in the first half to \u00a31.12bn.</p> <p>The pest control division made \u00a329.2m, up 5.4% on the previous year, on the back of growth in emerging markets. The slowing economy had an impact in the UK and north America, particularly in the retail part of the business. Profit from the division in the UK fell \u00a31.9m.</p> <p>Profit also declined in the washroom services division, which supplies air fresheners and hand dryers and restocks toilet paper for companies. Profit from the division fell 16.4% to \u00a344.8m, again reflecting the weakening economy.</p>",

  "<p><strong>Our neighbour has replaced her leylandii hedge with a fence. She has told us that we must not grow anything on our side of the fence. Has she a right to dictate this?</strong></p> <p>If it is on her land, then I'm afraid so.

Look for 'T' marks coming from the boundary. Whoever's side they are on owns the fence and must maintain it, and also has the right to tell their neighbour not to attach anything to it, including climbing plants and trellis. Alternatively, there may be T marks on both sides, in which case you have joint responsibility. There may also be none, in which case the law presumes that the fence belongs to the neighbour on the side with the struts and posts showing. Here's hoping she messed up and put the good side facing her garden. If all else fails, erect a freestanding trellis (or even a whole fence of your own) alongside her fence and plant merrily away.</p> <p><strong>Our lawn is a play and toilet area for our three dogs: dead grass in the summer and a mud bath in winter.

What's wrong with plain old gravel? It is not the loveliest surface, to my mind, but it beats chipped rubber - or your current mud and dead grass look - hands down. Urine runs through it, poo can be easily picked off it and, apparently, dogs are as happy to defecate on gravel as they are on grass, bless them. Choose something that lies flat, such as slate chippings, or that has rounded edges, such as pea gravel, and lay a water-permeable membrane beneath it to stop weeds growing through.</p>",

  "<p>The shipping forecast, a new version of the national anthem sanctioned by the Queen and the most famous footballer on the planet will herald the start of the London Olympiad tomorrow when the capital briefly takes centre stage in Beijing's Bird's Nest stadium.</p> <p>As China's games officially draw to an end with a closing ceremony certain to be epic in scale and execution, London has just eight minutes to mark the official handover of the Olympic flag. </p> <p>Organisers are pinning their hopes on a very British affair marked by an innovative score, a live performance of Led Zeppelin's Whole Lotta Love, a double-decker bus and David Beckham to set the tone for 2012.</p> <p>It is a hugely significant moment for the London project, with the \u00a32.5m show offering the first opportunity to make a global statement about what the city will bring to its games. Faced with the challenge of conveying so much in so short a time, it has gone for instantly recognisable icons and a big rock moment. The 70-strong cast rehearsed for for two weeks at a private airfield outside Beijing. </p> <p>Martin Green, head of ceremonies for London 2012, said the intention was to spark a celebration for the capital and the country. \"We have eight minutes to say 'this is London'.

Once he has waved the flag the required six times it will be carried out of the stadium accompanied by the National Youth Theatre singing the national anthem, arranged by music director Philip Sheppard.</p> <p>Then an animated title sequence bookended by the BBC World Service call sign, This Is London, will be played on the screens as a red double-decker bus, No 2012, arrives in the stadium. </p> <p>Awaiting it on the far side of the track at a London bus stop next to a zebra crossing complete with belisha beacons, will be the 36 dancers from the hip-hop troop Zoo Nation, the CanDoCo Contemporary Dance Company and Royal Opera artists, all sheltering under umbrellas.</p> <p>The bus will make its way round the track to a score written by Sheppard that evokes Britain's musical heritage without abandoning the contemporary tone. Jerusalem, Greensleeves and excerpts from the shipping forecast read by Radio 4 regular Zeb Soanes interweave with three traditional sea shanties with harmonies based on the chimes of Big Ben.</p> <p>Halfway round the track the bus will be joined by cycling gold medallists Chris Hoy and Victoria Pendleton, and BMX star Shanaze Reade dressed as a courier, a City gent and a London biker. Reade hopes to take part despite injuring her wrist when crashing out of the BMX final yesterday.</p> <p>When the bus arrives at the stop, a nine-year-old Londoner, Tayyiba Dudhwala, will emerge to be handed a football by Erika Tham, a Chinese-Canadian chosen to represent the children of the world. </p> <p>As the people in the queue dance beneath their brollies, the bus will begin a transformation, its roof opening like a lotus flower to reveal a stage. Leona Lewis will emerge on a platform to perform an R&amp;B aria. Meanwhile, Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page will appear at the other end of the bus and strike out the opening chords of Whole Lotta Love. In order to meet the eight-minute limit the song has been curtailed, but to Page's delight now cuts straight to the solo.</p> <p>As the duet climaxes, Beckham rises up on a third platform clutching the football flanked by a cellist and violinist in Team GB kit, and kicks the ball into the athletes packed in the centre field of the stadium.

  "<p>South Africa yesterday paved the way for a mass boycott of next month's Champions Trophy in Pakistan when it announced it was pulling out of the little-loved tournament on security grounds.</p> <p>The International Cricket Council board is expected to make a final decision on the venue tomorrow but the South African position - shared by England, Australia and New Zealand - leaves two realistic alternatives: host the competition elsewhere, which would anger both Pakistan and India, or cancel it altogether.</p> <p>A spokesman for the South African team explained that the decision had been based on a mixture of government advice and players' concern, while Norman Arendse, the president of Cricket South Africa, called on the ICC to \"reschedule the tournament as soon as possible\". With West Indies yesterday appearing to side with the sceptics, the odds on the tournament not taking place have increased.</p> <p>The South African announcement comes only three days after the chief executive of the Australian Professional Cricketers' Association, Paul Marsh, said he felt Pakistan was unsafe to tour, and security sources confirmed yesterday that the situation in the troubled republic had deteriorated in the last two weeks. Marsh's English counterpart at the Professional Cricketers' Association, Sean Morris, added: \"We're all in the same boat. Where [South Africa's decision] leaves the Champions Trophy is hard to tell.\"</p> <p>The gloom that has been descending on the beleaguered competition in recent weeks has extended to Pakistan, where the national board's chief operating officer, Shafqat Naghmi, said: \"We are deeply disappointed and, when a decision was to be made on Sunday, we think South Africa made a hasty choice. Now it's up to the ICC to take a decision but I would say South Africa's refusal will hurt the event.\" </p> <p>England will not make an official announcement until after tomorrow but it is inconceivable that the ICC can stage the tournament without the world's eight strongest teams, not least because of the disquiet that would be felt by the competition broadcasters ESPN Star Sports. An ICC spokesman was non-committal, saying: \"We are aware of South Africa's decision but we will comment only after discussing various aspects of the issue during the ICC board teleconference on Sunday.\" </p> <p>However it is understood that the game's governing body will discuss a venue switch today. Sri Lanka is the official stand-by host but South Africa are willing to step in at the last minute too, with the Wanderers ground in Johannesburg and Newlands in Cape Town both primed.</p> <p>Even so the secretary of the Board of Control for Cricket in India, Niranjan Shah, expressed his country's continued support for its neighbour. \"We are firmly behind Pakistan,\" he said. \"If Pakistan says the country is safe to play in and the tournament can be held on schedule, they have our support. But I can't say what the BCCI stance would be should the tournament be cancelled or moved.\"</p> <p>Since the ICC remains beholden to the whims of its constituent members it is likely that India's influence on the Pakistanis will now be crucial. The two countries have already threatened to boycott the Champions Trophy if it is staged outside Pakistan. But since the ICC's security task force has already failed in its attempts to allay the western nations' worries, the tournament's future could depend on India's willingness to appear as if it has lost the power struggle and lobby the Pakistanis for a change of venue.</p> <p>The Indians may not be disappointed if the Champions Trophy fails to take place. Since they lifted the World Twenty20 in South Africa a year ago, the focus of world cricket's powerhouse has shifted from the 50-over game to 20-over cricket, with the emphasis on non-international cricket.</p> <p>They have already had to move the money-spinning eight-team Champions League, which includes Middlesex, from September to December because of ICC concern over its proximity to the Champions Trophy. Cancellation may do little to discourage India's plans for Twenty20. The future of more than one competition could be at stake tomorrow.</p>",
  "<p>Tim Brabants, who returned to canoeing only two years ago after completing his training as a doctor, became Britain's 18th gold medallist of the games yesterday with a masterly display of controlled paddling in the K1 1,000m final at the Shunyi lake.</p> <p>But despite his medical background Brabants is not sure whether training for an Olympic title is actually good for you.</p> <p>After he stepped ashore at Shunyi as Britain's first Olympic champion in canoeing he described what it takes to win a gold medal - \"the work throughout the winter, the times you are falling to bits, the times when you are in pieces.\" </p> <p>Brabants puts his body through the mill day in, day out, with remorseless sessions on the water with a wind-sock attached to the bow of the kayak he paddles to increase the resistance.</p> <p>\"You'll be doing repeated efforts till you're down to walking pace. If my coach [Eric Farrell] is in the boat beside me, the engine will literally be idling. When you've finished the sessions, and you've probably been sick, you paddle a 30-kilometre warm-down to help reduce the lactic acid that causes your muscles to scream.\"</p> <p>Off the water, there are the endless repetitions of pull-ups to build up what Brabants calls his core muscles. The motion of paddling the kayak, the double-ended blade rotating in a figure-of-eight motion, calls for the muscles in the trunk and the back to be exceptionally powerful. </p> <p>\"I sometimes wonder,\" he said, \"if any of it is good for my body.\"</p> <p>In Sydney eight years ago, Brabants became the first British flatwater (or sprint) paddler to win a medal at the Olympics when he finished third in the K1 1,000m. He was 23.</p> <p>He finished fifth in Athens in 2004, after which he took time out from his training regime, which he accepts was probably good for his body. That was not the reason, though. He had taken his medical degree at Nottingham, largely because the British Canoe Union has its base there and the paddling facilities are good, and needed to complete his year as a junior house doctor.</p> <p>\"I did a bit of cycling and surfing. That was the best thing I could have done for my body and my brain. I'd been training non-stop since 1994, when I was 17.\"</p> <p>While the kayak remained in the boat rack, Brabants worked for 70 to 75 hours a week. When he had completed his year, the paddling was kept on hold for a further six months while he worked in an accident and emergency department on Jersey. His longest working week was 90 hours, but he found time to keep his fitness levels up.</p> <p>\"My consultant, Carl Clinton, was a rower, so I did the occasional gym session with him. I would finish a night shift at eight in the morning and go straight on the ergo [rowing machine] with him.\"</p> <p>At other times, when he came off night shift and wanted something less strenuous, Brabants would go surfing.</p> <p>But he always knew he was coming back to paddling. There was, he said, \"unfinished business\". In Athens he had won his heat in a world record time, but in his final five days later finished only fifth.</p> <p>The hours on the ergo made the transition stage, from doctor to rower, a swift one. \"I finished work in Jersey on February 8 [2006] and flew straight to Seville for a training camp and within four months was European champion,\" he said. The following year, he won his first world title.</p> <p>After the Beijing games, Brabants will go back to being a doctor. \"I need to find someone to employ me for a bit.\"</p> <p>Even though there is no unfinished business this time, he intends to come back to the water to prepare for London 2012. \"It's the call of an Olympics in your home town. It sounds a bit cliched, but I know how exciting it would be,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>Even before its release in the US the other week there was a stampede to denounce Ben Stiller's $90m action-comedy Tropic Thunder, a brutal satire of Hollywood egomania, star-fits, venal agents and producers and, um, Apocalypse Now.</p> <p>And no wonder. It's hard to know which aggrieved group is the most upset. First, there's the overweight, who were up in arms about the movie's references to a fictional, Eddie Murphy's Klumps-style \"Fatties\" comedy-flick franchise, while the organisers of the paralympics, no less, called for a boycott of the movie, on the grounds of its frequent use of the word \"retard\". </p> <p>But, surprisingly the group complaining the least - well, so far - is the one the American media apparently wishes would march on cinemas with torches and pitchforks: African-Americans. Because the touchiest aspect of the movie's 360-degree willingness to offend is its decision to paint Robert Downey Jr in blackface makeup. Downey plays a self-important, humourless Australian method actor named Kirk Lazarus who immerses himself so thoroughly in his role as a gung-ho black sergeant that he undergoes what the script calls a \"controversial procedure\" involving pigmentation alteration, puts on an Afro wig and undergoes \"Ebonics vocal training\" to become more convincing in his movie-within-the-movie role.</p> <p>It's a good thing they cast someone as intelligent and instinctively brilliant as Downey, though the actor was rightly nervous about grasping the nettle of American racism so tightly. As he told Entertainment Weekly, he even felt there was a chance his reputation might be \"destroyed\". \"That was my fear,\" he revealed.</p> <p>Downey's role is hedged in all around with caveats that make it abundantly clear that the joke is on Kirk Lazarus alone. First up, there's a real African-American character, named Alpa Chino and played by Brandon T Jackson, who's ready to call Lazarus on his method bullshit. Offscreen, Jackson also nixed the script's lone use of the N-word, a change Downey thoroughly endorsed.</p> <p>Now, just because it's loud and clear that the joke is all on Kirk Lazarus and not on African-Americans, this is still incredibly edgy material in a country whose history of slavery and racism still reverberates to the present day. After all, it's only four and a half decades since America's blacks were guaranteed the right to vote.</p> <p>We may have a black man running for the presidency, but we also have a broad resurgence of racially-based humour in stand-up comedy - one thinks of the tightrope delicately (and not so delicately) trodden by such comics as Sarah Silverman, Jim Norton and Nick DiPaolo - and across the media, while right-wing radio hosts make more of perceived \"black racism\" and \"special pleading\" than they do of naked or coded white bigotry. McCain's team accusing Obama of \"playing the race card from the bottom of the deck\" - that indelible phrase, uttered by a white man to describe the OJ Simpson defence team's strategy - is a classic recent use of dog-whistle racism. We shall discover on election day just how racially divided America remains, and many are not optimistic about what November 4 may tell us.</p> <p>That's the increasingly toxic racial atmosphere into which Tropic Thunder was released. But equally important is the centuries-old genre of \"blackface\" or \"minstrelsy\" from which the Kirk Lazarus conceit ultimately derives. Blackface is as old as, and perhaps even older than, Othello, but its American version, poisoned by the nightmarish experience of slavery, began even before the civil war, as a weird conduit through which aspects of the African-American experience were transmitted to a white audience. The semi-official Southern anthem Dixie came from the blackface tradition (original phonetic lyrics: \"I wish I was in de land ob cotton/ Old times dar am not forgotten/ Look away! Look away! Look away! Dixie Land\"), and the pervasive Jim Crow laws enacted during the post-civil war reconstruction era were named for an 1828 minstrel song called Jump Jim Crow by white minstrel TD \"Daddy\" Rice. It was all self-evidently racist - but such ugliness will always have unintended consequences.</p> <p>Minstrelsy - which at first involved whites blacking themselves up with burnt cork and performing pseudo-black acts - was surpisingly enduring, its popularity lasting from about 1830 to around 1930. Somewhere in this period blacks themselves got into the act, to the extent that they too had to wear blackface, cartoonish Afro wigs and obscenely overdone red-and-white mouth make-up, a tradition carried on by black comics like \"Pigmeat\" Markham deep into the latter half of the 20th century. Black people dressing up as racist stereotypes of themselves? There's a reason Greil Marcus called this period \"The Old, Weird America\".</p> <p>The black version of blackface was inevitably more \"authentic\", the music was probably a lot better, and even the great black reformer Frederick Douglass felt moved in 1849 to say of the phenomenon, \"It is something to be gained when the coloured man in any form can appear before a white audience\" (which only proves how awful things were). In the 20th century, radio comedy The Amos'n'Andy Show, starring white comedians performing a sort of \"aural blackface\", was one of the most popular and (in formal terms) most influential and innovative programmes of the 1930s, with its short-lived TV spin-off still being syndicated in 1966.</p> <p>Nick Tosches has also made bold claims for blackface in his book Where Dead Voices Gather, a profile of Emmett Miller, an obscure (white) blackface performer whose (largely non-racist) songs have been covered by Hank Williams, Merle Haggard and - ye gods! - David Lee Roth. The absorption of black styles into white music started a long time before rock'n'roll blew up, and much of it happened as an unexpected by-product of minstrelsy.</p> <p>The list of famous artists who have performed in blackface at one time or another is simply staggering: Fred Astaire, Shirley Temple, Judy Garland, Al Jolson, Eddie Cantor, Milton Berle, Joan Crawford, Doris Day, Bing Crosby, both Frank Sinatra and Dino in the original Ocean's 11, and more recently, Dan Aykroyd in Trading Places, C Thomas Howell in Soul Man, and Ed Harris in Masked And Anonymous. Let's not forget, either, that the BBC's Black And White Minstrel Show ran until 1978.</p> <p>By the 1960s, minstrelsy and blackface inevitably attracted black satirists. Comedian Godfrey Cambridge made Watermelon Man, playing a suburban white bigot who wakes up black one morning. But bear in mind the studio originally wanted the role played - in blackface, natch - by Alan Arkin or Jack Lemmon. In 1970. Since then we have seen multiple Eddie Murphys in \"whiteface\", as well as Dave Chappelle, and the Wayans brothers in White Chicks. But perhaps the most blistering take on the phenomenon was Spike Lee's scathing satire Bamboozled, in which a horribly racist blackface TV pitch, designed to get its creator fired, becomes a massive hit in white America. It ends with a montage of grotesque, depressing racist imagery from American movies and TV shows, many still very familiar to us.</p> <p>Barack Obama may be running as a \"post-racial\" candidate, but America is not yet a post-racial society (something it has in common with many others, let it be stressed). And however much America deludes itself that it has transcended race, the old deformities, absurdities and animosities still linger in new forms: idiot fratboys blacking up for Halloween parties; the suburban wigga; the modern right's cynical co-opting of the politics of historical grievance for its own ends (\"He called me whitey! Wah!\"). In comedy, race is the final frontier, and sharper comedians will always be tempted to lambast the mentality of denial that's discernible in a neutered public culture of white liberal guilt, as Stiller and Downey do in Tropic Thunder. Those with poor judgment can sail off the edge of the world: just ask Seinfeld's Michael Richards. </p> <p>No matter how much things improve, race always finds new ways to make us crazy. One line from Tropic Thunder sums up the whole demented parallel-universe of blackface: \"I know who I am!\" says Lazarus. \"I'm a dude playing a dude disguised as another dude!\" </p> <p>He has no idea.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Tropic Thunder is released on Sep 19</p> <h2>Comedy's last taboo... </h2> <p>It's been 30 years since The Black And White Minstrel Show last entertained primetime viewers, but examples of blacking up have been creeping back on to our screens over the last few years. <strong>Richard Vine</strong> takes the role call...</p> <p><strong>Little Britain </strong></p> <p>Matt Lucas and David Walliams extended their repertoire of female grotesques with mail-order Thai bride Ting Tong and the introduction of ex-Miss Botswana and former international showjumper Desiree DeVere, love rival of the portly Bubbles.</p> <p><strong>League Of Gentlemen </strong></p> <p>\"Wanna buy some pegs, Dave?\" Even in a town crammed full of local eccentrics, evil minstrel \"wife-collector\" Papa Lazarou stood out as one of the freakiest residents.</p> <p><strong>Bo!

  "<p>Israel last night warned an attempt by peace activists to sail two wooden boats to the Gaza Strip was a \"provocation\" and said it would prevent them reaching their destination.</p> <p>A group of 46 activists set sail yesterday morning from Cyprus and were hoping to reach Gaza later today to challenge the economic blockade Israel has imposed on the strip and to deliver a cargo of 200 hearing aids for a deaf school and 5,000 balloons. Among those on board is a Catholic nun, aged 81, the British journalist Yvonne Ridley and Lauren Booth, sister-in-law of Tony Blair.</p> <p>\"I've been nervous, but today I'm excited,\" said Booth, 41, shortly before the boats sailed. \"It's not about our fear, it's about the people waiting in Gaza, you can't think about anything else.\"</p> <p>Another passenger, Huwaida Arraf, a Palestinian with Israeli and US citizenship, said: \"The siege that the Israelis have imposed on Gaza is not only illegal in terms of international law, it is also immoral. Global institutions and the governments of the world know what is happening and are not doing anything about it.\"</p> <p>Israel has already warned those on board not to undertake the journey and last night Aviv Shiron, spokesman for Israel's foreign ministry, said the voyage was a \"provocation\" and that \"all options\" were under consideration to prevent the boats reaching Gaza. An Israeli admiral has issued an apparent warning to all shipping to stay clear of waters near Gaza because of an unspecified \"security situation.\"</p> <p>It appears most likely that there will be a standoff with the Israeli navy later today, and that the activists will be arrested rather than being allowed into Gaza. Although Israel withdrew its soldiers and settlers from Gaza in 2005, it still controls Gaza's air space and sea space, as well as nearly all the border crossings. Until a recent ceasefire with Hamas the Israeli military was mounting regular incursions into the strip, saying it wanted to stop rocket fire into southern Israel. It has imposed a tight economic blockade of Gaza, saying it wants to weaken Hamas, the Islamist group which won Palestinian elections more than two years ago.</p> <p>In a statement issued as they departed yesterday, the activists said they would lodge a legal protest against any attempt by the Israelis to arrest them. </p> <p>\"If Israel chooses to forcibly stop and search our ships, we will not forcibly resist,\" they said. \"If we are arrested and brought to Israel, we will protest and prosecute our kidnapping in the appropriate forums ... It is our purpose to show the power that ordinary citizens have when they organise to stand against injustice.\"</p>",
  "<p>Suddenly, serial killers are heroes - or anti-heroes - in thrillers. They include Lawrence Block's hitman Keller, Jeff Lindsay's deliciously depraved Dexter, and now Christopher Brookmyre's fiendish Simon Darcourt, whose personal body count exceeds 400. How do these authors get away with such a reversal of the accepted rules of morality? With humour, of course, where we can laugh without worrying about the growing pile of corpses. In this book, Darcourt has found a way of broadcasting his own British reality shows live on the internet. A fourth-rate record producer is electrocuted live while his song \"It hurts so good\" plays in the background. The climax is the show I'm a Celebrity and I'm Never Getting Out of Here, in which the public votes on which kidnapped celebrity is to die first. Brilliant and hilarious.</p>",

  "<p>A 24-year-old man died after being shot in the head and neck in Peckham, south London, yesterday only a few hundred metres from where a teenager was shot in a convenience store two weeks ago, police said.</p> <p>The man, who had not been formally identified last night, was found in a carpark shortly before 3am yesterday in what police say is likely to be a gang-related killing. His death is the latest in a spate of violent attacks in the capital this year involving young people using guns or knives. </p> <p>The incident occurred a short walk from the Costcutter in Camberwell Road where Ryan Bravo, 18, was shot earlier this month.</p> <p>\"There is nothing to suggest that it is [related to the Costcutter shooting],\" said Detective Inspector Tony Boughton, of Operation Trident, the specialist team that deals with gun crime. He confirmed that the victim was known to police.</p> <p>A postmortem was carried out yesterday and the victim's identity will be released after his next-of-kin have been notified.</p> <p>Police have appealed to anyone who may have been in the area between 2.30am and 3am yesterday.</p> <p>The latest incident comes after three more men, two aged 19 and one 17, were arrested on suspicion of Ryan Bravo's murder last week. Ashley Bucknor, 19, of no fixed address, has been charged with murder.

  "<p>Britain's most senior Asian police officer, who is suing Scotland Yard, should stand down or be suspended from his role on the force's management board, the head of the Metropolitan police authority said yesterday.</p> <p>Lawyers for Assistant Commissioner Tarique Ghaffur yesterday filed an employment tribunal claim accusing the Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir Ian Blair, and the force of racial discrimination and victimisation.</p> <p>The 60-page claim alleges that Ghaffur, 53, who is third in charge of the force, was discriminated against on the grounds of race and religion. It also alleges age discrimination because his contract was extended by only a year, while those with less service would be offered longer contracts. </p> <p>The Guardian understands his claim says he was discriminated against over his role in running security for the 2012 London Olympics and over his treatment as the head of Scotland Yard's central operations division. He is the most senior police officer ever to sue his own force for discrimination and has triggered what is likely to be a long and bitter fight at the top of Scotland Yard.</p> <p>Len Duvall, chair of the MPA and staunch ally of Blair, said that Ghaffur should stand down or be suspended from the management board while his legal case proceeds.</p> <p>Duvall said: \"It must increase the tensions between colleagues. If any member of the management board takes legal action against the MPS or their managers within the management board, I cannot see how they can - or would want to - be on the management board. This would not be victimisation - it's just common sense.\"</p> <p>Any attempt to remove Ghaffur now he has issued legal proceedings would lead to his lawyers attempting to gain an injunction. </p> <p>The Guardian has learned that last month Blair had a face-to-face showdown with Ghaffur in which he threatened to strip him of his command and transfer him out of the force.</p> <p>Then, the view of Blair and top officers was that Ghaffur could not be suing the force and at the same time be part of its inner cabinet. But insiders say Blair may have backed down after legal advice made clear such an action would be seen as victimisation by an employment tribunal.</p> <p>The pending legal case adds to a series of crises facing the Met commissioner, whose term expires in January 2010. Blair's allies believe the Ghaffur saga has already led to details of \u00a33m-worth of contracts the Met gave to a close friend of the commissioner's being leaked to the media. The concern has led to Blair facing a formal inquiry into corruption allegations.</p> <p>Next month the Met faces an inquest into the shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes, the Brazilian who was mistaken for a terrorist at a tube station in July 2005.</p>",
  "<p>The Spanish pilots' union sent a series of letters and emails to Spanair's senior management warning of safety worries more than a year before Wednesday's crash at Madrid airport claimed 153 lives, it emerged yesterday.</p> <p>In one letter the union, Sepla, wrote to Lars Nygaard, then Spanair director, and Marcus Hedblom, present managing director, warning: \"The operative chaos is putting passengers at risk.\"</p> <p>The letter, dated April 2007, said: \"It's our obligation to inform you of the elevated unease which exists between ourselves for the daily running [of the company] for the past month.\" It alluded to a lack of resources, a scarcity of ground crew and a number of planes which had been declared unfit to fly.</p> <p>In another letter, pilots complained \"unfortunately all this indicates this will end in chaos\", and in a further letter the union warned: \"The norms about operating punctuality, desired by all, stop in many cases the realisation of norms of airline security.\"</p> <p>Spanair did not respond to attempts by the Guardian to verify the claims.</p> <p>Meanwhile, a video of the crash yesterday suggested it was not caused by either of the plane's engines bursting into flames, as had first been thought.</p> <p>The video shows Spanair flight JK 5022 take off and struggle to gain altitude, never rising higher than 50 metres, before it crashes to the ground. The plane then skids along the runway, breaks apart and bursts into flames.</p> <p>The security video, taken by AENA, which runs Spain's airports, appears to contradict suggestions that an explosion or fire in one of the engines could have led to the crash at Barajas airport.</p> <p>Manuel Bautista, director general of AENA, said the plane had suffered more than one fault. \"The motor is not the cause of the accident,\" he said.</p> <p>One of the investigators, Emilio Valerio, told the Cadena Ser radio station the video would be used to establish the cause of the tragedy.</p> <p>A recently married couple who met in London were among those who lost their lives in the crash. Brazilian Ronaldo Gomes Silva, 25, and his Spanish wife, Yanina Celis Dibowsky, 21, met when they were living in London and married last month in Brazil. </p> <p>The couple were making a visit to the Canary Islands to stay with her family before returning to London to begin their married life.</p> <p>The groom's father, Juli\u00e3o Alves da Silva, told Brazilian television: \"I am destroyed.

Dibowsky worked there as an ice-cream seller.</p> <p>Silva's brother Rodinaldo, 27, who also lives in London, has flown to Madrid to arrange for his body to be returned to Brazil.</p> <p>Also killed was Siomara Hern\u00e1ndez, 19, who was 12 weeks pregnant, along with her baby son Tanausu and 15-year-old sister Abenauara. They were flying back to the Canary Islands to celebrate news of her pregnancy with family.</p> <p>A funeral will be held for the victims of the crash in Madrid's Almudena Cathedral on September 1. And with at least 20 of the victims coming from the Canary Islands, authorities on the islands were planning a large funeral there in the coming days.</p>",
  "<p>They are the biggest stars to grace Bollywood's silver screen, an acting dynasty of mythical proportions. Now the Bachchans, India's best-known acting family, are exporting their brand globally. </p> <p>Tomorrow night Amitabh Bachchan, the godfather of Indian cinema, will star with his son Abhishek and his daughter-in-law, former Miss World Aishwarya Rai, India's biggest female star, in the first Bollywood show to be held at the O2 arena in London. As part of a 28-city tour across five continents, the Bollywood royal family will be joined in London by a cast of 130, and erstwhile Celebrity Big Brother star Shilpa Shetty, for three hours of upbeat Hindi song, painstakingly choreographed dance routines and lashings of glitz and glamour. </p> <p>Big B, as Amitabh is known, has not done a tour of this kind for nearly a decade. Speaking before the tour, the 65-year-old star - who with more than 130 top-grossing films to his name is treated like a deity in India - said it was to reciprocate his fans' affection: \"It is strenuous, but the love of the fans is so strong, we decided on this.\" </p> <p>But high ticket prices and controversial film subjects have left some fans feeling forgotten and disenchanted, said Asjad Nazir, showbiz editor for the Asian newspaper Eastern Eye. The Bachchans were not the force in Indian cinema that they once had been, he added. \"Between them they have had a wretched run at the box office in the past few years. Recently the Bachchans are too much about the brand, too much about cashing in on the brand and not enough about the films.\"</p> <p>With O2 tickets ranging from \u00a338.50 to \u00a3250 there is a price to suit a range of fans, with the design of the arena enabling even those in the cheap seats to get a good view, said Viraf Sarkari, director of Wizcraft International, producers of the show.</p>",
  "<h2>1. Compare flight prices for different dates</h2> <p>Knowing when airline tickets are being sold at their cheapest is the most effective way of saving money on travel. Until recently this was a tedious affair that involved inputting dozens of dates into several search engines. But last month Opodo launched a tool that takes the legwork and guesswork out of buying long-haul flights.</p> <p><strong>MyAirline</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.promos.opodo.co.uk/travel/airlines\">promos.opodo.co.uk/travel/airlines</a>) tracks the prices of more than 100 major carriers for the following four months. It then breaks down the information into individual route plans and presents the results in a graph, so you can see when each airline drops its price to the lowest point. For example, a flight to Miami with Virgin Atlantic in August costs \u00a3719, but next month the price drops to \u00a3378. What's neat is that the graph also compares your chosen airline with the average price of a flight on that route (taken from the other airlines in Opodo's database), giving you an idea whether your favoured airline is offering a good deal. So, a flight to Tokyo on JAL is cheaper than average in October, but higher than average a month later.</p> <p>Opodo offers another new service that lets you combine airlines on long-haul flights, allowing you to fly out with one and return with another. This is something that's long been possible with budget airlines, but has been prohibitively expensive with long-haul, as two singles traditionally cost more than a return.</p> <p>Using the <strong>Combiflight</strong> tool (<a href=\"http://www.opodo.co.uk/opodo/flights/flights\">opodo.co.uk/opodo/flights/flights</a>), we found a return flight to New York in October for \u00a3344, flying out on Air France and returning with Delta. Moreover, combined deals increase the range of flights on offer (fly to JFK, say, and fly back from Newark).</p> <h2>2. Consider alternatives to hotels</h2> <p>It's about time we had a decent hotel comparison site to match those for flights. The best is <strong>Hotels Comparison</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.hotelscomparison.com\">hotelscomparison.com</a>), which searches several online brokers, including Octopus Travel, Hotel Club and Late Rooms. Although far from comprehensive, it demonstrates the huge difference in prices offered by different agents. Lansdowne Place in Brighton, for example, ranges from \u00a395 to \u00a3215 per night depending who you book with.</p> <p>But if you really want to save money, forget about hotels altogether and find an apartment. The shrewdest move is to rent directly from the landlord; check either the London arm of <strong>Craig's List</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.london.craigslist.co.uk/vac\">london.craigslist.co.uk/vac</a>) or the ever-growing branches of <strong>Gumtree</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.gumtree.com/other_gumtrees.html\">gumtree.com/other_gumtrees.html</a>). You could also consider downsizing to a private room in a hostel. <strong>Travel Stay</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.travelstay.com\">travelstay.com</a>) sources cheap hotels and hostel accommodation in the UK. It also offers rooms in university halls of residence (out of term time). Private rooms in Churchill College in Cambridge cost just \u00a335 per night.</p> <p>An even more radical solution is to stay with a local. The recently launched <strong>Airbed and Breakfast</strong> (<a href=\"http:www.airbedandbreakfast.com\">airbedandbreakfast.com</a>) rents out everything from people's spare rooms to an airbed on their floor. The site launched last month but already offers beds in 31 countries and takes credit card bookings. Quality ranges from a sofa in a living room, to a room (<a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/5fnsfw\">tinyurl.com/5fnsfw</a>) in central Rome - and prices reflect that ranging from \u00a33 to \u00a350. Some might question why you would pay when you can get a free room through couchsurfing.com, but it's a useful alternative if you can't get a bed through couchsurfing, and anyhow, if someone is offering you clean sheets and breakfast, isn't it right to give them a few pounds for their trouble?</p> <h2>3. Save on car insurance</h2> <p>Holiday car hire can be costly; even if prices look competitive you can end up paying extra for insurance. The trick is to buy insurance in advance from a specialist such as <strong>Daily Excess</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.dailyexcess.com\">dailyexcess.com</a>), which will insure you against the hefty excesses charged by most hire companies. For the car hire itself, use a price comparison site. <strong>Travel Supermarket</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.travelsupermarket.com\">travelsupermarket.com</a>) searches more brokers than any other. Also check <strong>Travelocity</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.travelocity.co.uk\">travelocity.co.uk</a>) and <strong>Car Rentals</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.carrentals.com\">carrentals.com</a>).</p> <h2>4. Park smartly</h2> <p>Smart airport parking can shave pounds off the cost of your holiday. First check whether it is cheaper to travel to the airport by public transport (it almost always is) or taxi. If neither of these is feasible then <strong>Go Simply</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.gosimply.com/airport-parking\">gosimply.com/airport-parking</a>) compares rates at all major UK airports. It encourages pre-booking, which can reduce the cost by 60%. To save even more money you could park outside somebody's house. <strong>Park at My House</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.parkatmyhouse.com\">parkatmyhouse.com</a>) connects drivers with people who have a spare driveway or parking service near an airport. How much you pay and how long you stay is between the two of you.</p> <h2>5. Don't ignore packages</h2> <p>It is usually cheaper to arrange a holiday independently, but you can save a huge amount by booking a late deal when operators are desperate to sell off unsold package holidays. The best place to get last minute deals is the Co-op. As we were going to press, <strong>Co-operative Travel</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.cooptravel.co.uk\">cooptravel.co.uk</a>) had a 14-day break in Crete for \u00a3109pp (flight plus self-catering accommodation). If transport is not part of the package use a transfer service such as <strong>Resorthoppa</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.resorthoppa.com\">resorthoppa.com</a>). Rates are as low as \u00a36 per person for an airport transfer.</p>",
  "<p>The words market garden aren't normally used to describe Walthamstow, a built-up corner of north-east London better known for the greyhound stadium that closed last week. But amid the rows of Victorian and Edwardian terraces there's a thriving home-grown food industry. </p> <p>Last year a small group of volunteers picked 12 tonnes of fruit, that would otherwise have rotted, from gardens and street trees across the borough.</p> <p>OrganicLea's scrumping scheme lets householders keep 25% of the fruit collected, while the rest is sold at the co-op's market stall or turned into juice.</p> <p>Clare Joy of OrganicLea estimates that even in such urban areas, one in four detached or semi-detached houses have fruit trees in their garden, yet much of it simply goes to waste.</p> <p>\"It ranges from street trees and pub gardens to residents who are housebound and unable to pick themselves, and pear-tree owners who are sadly not that keen on pears. We discovered a beautiful Victorian kitchen garden with orchard and hothouse but lacking the full-time gardener it would once have had.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, some allotment holders are fighting the credit crunch by swapping their surplus goods for a free pint down the pub. At The Pigs in Edgefield, near Holt, Norfolk, customers are greeted with a sign that reads: \"If you breed, grow, shoot or steal anything you feel may be at home on our menu, ask at the bar. Let's do a deal.\"</p> <p>So far, pints have been swapped for potatoes, mackerel and a kilo of fresh fruit. Pub regular Derek Feast, 64, exchanges his free-range chicken eggs for a pint. \"I have a job where I earn the national minimum wage, so this little bit of extra money helps me get out,\" he told the Daily Telegraph.</p> <p>Organised food swaps - a sort of urban village fete where you can get good food for free by swapping what you've brought - are becoming popular across Britain. The first Great Food Swap was staged by Growing Communities (<a href=\"http://www.growingcommunities.org\">growingcommunities.org</a>) in October 2006 in Stoke Newington, north London. It was so overwhelmed by visitors that it has now become an annual event.</p> <p>The summer may have been a washout, but the wet and warm conditions have been perfect for cucumbers, squash, courgettes and marrows. If you want to sell your bumper crop rather than swap it or give it away, it's not easy. Some allotment associations occasionally rent stalls at farmer's markets, but the cash earned is usually ploughed back into association funds.</p> <p>There are some weekly stalls at year-round markets where allotment holders can take their surplus for sale. OrganicLea runs a weekly market stall, primarily supplied by a farmers' co-op in Norfolk, but it also offers surplus produce from local allotments. The stall takes 25% and the allotment holder gets 75% of whatever is made.</p> <p>There's also the option of roadside sales, which are particularly popular with small-scale egg producers. Just five backyard chickens can easily lay 1,250 or more eggs a year, leaving the average family with a surplus of dozens of eggs every week. </p> <p>According to <a href=\"http://www.allotment.org.uk\">allotment.org.uk</a>, so long as your roadside sales are surplus, and production is not at commercial levels, you can rely on a technical exemption called \"farm gate sales\". </p> <p>But take them to market and the Egg Marketing Inspectorate will be watching to make sure that each one is marked with a producer code number. You are also not allowed to sell to any catering establishments.</p> <p>The law on selling surplus produce from allotments confuses some smallholders. Many allotment associations tell members it is against the law to sell their goods, but that's not entirely correct according to Bryn Pugh, legal consultant to the National Society of Allotment and Leisure Gardeners. \"Strictly speaking, produce from allotments cannot be sold, but there should be no objection to the occasional sale of surplus produce. What is prohibited under the Allotments Acts, 1908-1950 (section 22, subsection 1) is that an allotment cannot be used to support a business.\"</p> <p>But he says that if an allotment holder can prove they have more than they can use themselves, it won't be regarded as illegal to sell the surplus. \"There are only so many courgettes you can eat in a week,\" he says.</p> <p>Bend the rules too far, however, and you'll be the disgrace of the green-fingered community. In one case in north-west England last year, an allotment holder was found to be growing soft fruit purely for his wife's jam-making business. \"The tenant was removed. It is totally against the ethics of allotment gardening,\" says Pugh.</p>",
  "<p>As Russian tanks rumbled imperiously across Georgia and French troops were slaughtered in a 10-hour firefight near Kabul, western security policy appeared to be in disarray, challenged on several fronts and struggling to cope.</p> <p>The embodiment of that policy for two generations, the Nato military alliance looked over-stretched, under-resourced, and hobbled by bureaucratic infighting among its 26 member states.</p> <p>When their foreign ministers met in Brussels to deliver a response to Russia's invasion of Georgia, the crisis was promptly compounded by the news of the worst French losses in 25 years at the hands of the Taliban in Afghanistan.</p> <p>Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, Nato's secretary general, found himself having to explain the alliance's value. \"It is worth what it has been worth since 1949. That's my short answer,\" he said.</p> <p>But there are plenty of policy makers in Brussels, from Nato and the EU, who increasingly wonder whether that statement of purpose is warranted.</p> <p>\"Terrorism, radicalisation, climate change, energy - these are the biggest security threats nowadays and they are not something Nato can do much about. It doesn't have an answer,\" said an EU official, who wished not to be named. </p> <p>Born in 1949, Nato's original function and purpose was to keep the Soviet Union at bay and keep the Americans in Europe. But in recent years the alliance has suffered from strategic confusion while morphing into a very different organisation. Nato has become a global gendarme, fighting wars far away from its \"North Atlantic\" core, peacekeeping, and expanding civilian control of the military in new democracies through its policy of admitting countries from the Balkans and the former eastern bloc.</p> <p>This week's events in Georgia and Afghanistan throw Nato's very different dilemmas and missions into sharp focus.</p> <p>\"For the last five years we have been increasingly focused on being an expeditionary force [in Afghanistan],\" said an unnamed Nato diplomat. \"Now we have to struggle with the return of the classical Nato challenge [in Georgia] and we're going to have to manage to do both.\"</p> <p>Vladimir Putin's throttling of Georgia, say analysts and diplomats, presents big risks and big opportunities. \"The era of Russian weakness is over. We're now in a much more competitive relationship with Russia and Georgia has put European security back on the geopolitical map, also for the US. All that could mean a rejuvenation of Nato,\" said Tomas Valasek at the Centre for European Reform.</p> <p>The new Nato states in the Baltics and central Europe are not, unlike the US or Britain, preoccupied with terrorism, Afghanistan, or Iran's nuclear potential. Their bugbear is the Kremlin. The Czechs and the Poles have agreed to host the Pentagon's missile defence system not because they worry about Iranian missiles, but because they feel more secure by having US troops permanently on their soil for the first time.</p> <p>\"If we said no to the Americans, there's a danger the transatlantic alliance could unravel and the Americans could leave Europe. We think that would be a disaster,\" said a Czech official.</p> <p>For small west European countries, too, Nato's value includes keeping the US committed to Europe's defence and engaged in its politics.</p> <p>\"For the Czechs, Nato is existential,\" said a Dutch EU official. \"But for the Dutch or the Portuguese Nato is also about looking to the Americans to keep the big European powers in check.\"</p> <p>In Afghanistan, Nato critics and loyalists agree, the alliance's first ground war is deciding its future. With the Taliban resurgent and western casualties at their highest since the Taliban were overthrown in 2001, the Senlis Council thinktank declared this week that Nato was failing in Afghanistan. The Nato diplomat said the Taliban were \"having some short-term tactical successes\".</p> <p>The Nato-led coalition's lack of success in Afghanistan has exposed divisions caused recriminations, with Germany bearing the brunt of the criticism for its reluctance to put its forces on the frontlines.</p> <p>Germany has also been central to the Georgia crisis, highlighting the limits of Nato's policies towards Russia and its post-cold war policy of expanding into the countries around Russia's rim.</p> <p>At a Nato summit in April, while agreeing that Georgia would eventually join the alliance, Germany undid that promise by blocking US pressure to open negotiations to bring Georgia in. The German veto, admits an unnamed senior US official, emboldened the Kremlin in its invasion preparations. \"Russia misread that decision and saw it as a lack of resolve on Nato's part.\"</p> <p>In a report on the Georgia crisis to be released on Monday, the European Council on Foreign Relations says: \"Moscow is well aware that few Nato members want to extend a mutual security guarantee to a country at war with Europe's biggest neighbour.\"</p> <p>This cuts to Nato's policy flaw. \"The main question is, are you willing to go to war for Tbilisi? I think the answer is no,\" said the EU official.</p>",
  "<p>The Nunthorpe Stakes might have made an unexpected switch to Suffolk when the Ebor Festival was abandoned, but the prize itself could not be wrested away from Yorkshire yesterday, as Borderlescott finished fast and late to secure a first Group One winner for Robin Bastiman's yard at Wetherby. \"It would have been better if we could have won at York on home ground,\" Bastiman said afterwards, \"and the [trainer's] 10% [of the prize money] would have been better too, but we've won and that's all that matters.\" </p> <p>Borderlescott may not be the very best sprinter in training, for all that he took more than a second off the five-furlong track record as he beat National Colour and Kingsgate Native. But he is surely one of the most consistent, having now won nine of his 35 starts and finished second in 13 more, often by narrow margins. </p> <p>\"He's a really good animal, he's only small but he must have the heart of a lion,\" Bastiman said. \"We always thought that six furlongs was just finding him out and I think that five is really his trip. This is his time of year, the autumn, and it will be the Prix de l'Abbaye [in Paris on Arc day] next. He's in the Ayr Gold Cup, but I think the handicapper will have something to say about that now. </p> <p>Having achieved his ambition of winning a Group One, Bastiman may now turn his yard over to his children. \"When is it ever the right time? I don't know, but it would be nice if they could start with a really good horse, and I can just be in the background to give advice if they need it.\" </p> <p>Thousands of people had their plans for the week ruined when York was abandoned, but for one man at least, it has all worked out rather well. Jim Bolger would not have allowed Lush Lashes to contest the Yorkshire Oaks had it been run on heavy ground on Thursday, but the re-arranged race on good going at Newmarket yesterday proved much more to his liking, as the three-year-old proved herself one of the most talented and versatile fillies of recent years. </p> <p>Lush Lashes ran away with the Coronation Stakes over a mile at Royal Ascot and was desperately unlucky not to win the Nassau Stakes over 10 furlongs at Goodwood. The 12-furlong trip was the only doubt against her name yesterday, following a poor run in the Oaks back in June, but she saw out every yard to beat Dar Re Mi and set a new course record in the process. </p> <p>Lush Lashes too took more than a second off the old mark, thanks at least in part to a strong tailwind in the straight. </p> <p>\"Obviously stamina was an issue, but it wasn't a big issue and I never really had any doubts,\" Bolger said. \"A mile, a mile and a quarter or a mile and a half, it all comes the same to her and we might even come back here for the Sun Chariot Stakes [over a mile at the Cambridgeshire meeting].\" </p> <p>At Newbury, All The Good was a decisive winner of the totesport Newburgh Handicap, the replacement for the Ebor, coming with a strong run two furlongs out to land the prize for Godolphin at 25-1. The Group Two Gimcrack Stakes, meanwhile, saw an equally impressive success by Shaweel, with Marine Boy, the hot favourite from Tom Dascombe's yard, one of the first horses beaten.</p>",

  "<p>There was one conspicuous absence from the tanned and tired procession of voyagers who filed through the arrivals hall of Heathrow's Terminal 3 yesterday morning. Between the crowds of sombrero-wearing, surfboard-wielding travellers, Paul Francis Gadd, better known as Gary Glitter, was nowhere to be seen. But then the 64-year-old convicted paedophile and glam rocker had made different arrangements for his feverishly anticipated arrival back in Britain, or had different arrangements made for him. </p> <p>When Thai Airways flight TG910 touched down at 7.09am, Gadd was not met by friends or relatives. His welcoming committee comprised eight Metropolitan police officers who escorted him from the plane ahead of the other passengers and whisked him away from a frustrated gaggle of reporters, photographers and television crews. It was an abrupt climax to a bizarre week which has seen Gadd shunted from Thailand to Hong Kong and back to Thailand as he searched for a hiding hole after serving almost three years in a Vietnamese prison for committing obscene acts with two young girls. </p> <p>By 9am, with the disgraced rocker still nowhere to be seen, the press pack had decamped to the rainswept surroundings of Uxbridge magistrates court, where, rumour had it, he would appear to find out whether he would be put on the sex offenders' register for the rest of his life. Again, Gadd failed to materialise, apparently preferring to stay in an immigration office at Terminal 3. </p> <p>His lawyer, David Corker, told the court that his client had been wrongly convicted in Vietnam and questioned the conviction's legality under British law. \"This was a conviction obtained in the most appalling of circumstances. My client feels it was an unfair trial and a travesty of justice. We need to inquire whether this conviction should be recognised by this court.\" </p> <p>The Vietnamese justice system was \"far, far below what is acceptable in western European standards\". Rajeev Shetty, counsel for the Metropolitan police, said the case was clear. \"The fact remains that Mr Gadd was aware what the police were intending to do at least three or four days ago. Mr Gadd's situation is clear. Mr Gadd has been convicted of a relevant offence and the fact of that conviction cannot possibly be challenged.\"</p> <p>District judge David Simpson rejected the request, saying the conviction was not disputed and the conditions for an indefinite notification order had been met. Imposing the order that requires Gadd to sign the sex offenders' register within three days, he added: \"Mr Gadd has demonstrated his desire to avoid the jurisdiction of this court.\" </p> <p>Under the terms of the order, Gadd will have to tell police where he plans to live and inform them of any travel plans. He will have 21 days to appeal.</p> <p>The cat-and-mouse hunt for Gadd continued into the afternoon, with reports that he had been spotted getting out of a taxi in Tooting, south London.</p> <p>\"He didn't seem to have any bags and was shouting at the taxi driver, asking him where he was,\" said Bob Bennett, a local, who added: \"He asked me the way to Tooting Broadway. I told him to hop on the number 76 bus. The kids at the bus stop were asking their mums 'Is that Gary Glitter?'\" </p> <p>Corker said his client was happy to be back in Britain and insisted that Gadd's days in international limbo, including the abortive trip to Hong Kong and the 20 hours he spent in the transit lounge of Bangkok airport, had not been wasted. \"It enabled Mr Gadd and others to put into practice a plan for his proper and safe arrival. Mr Gadd is not a well man, he needs medical attention and is also, unsurprisingly, concerned about his safety and these past few days have enabled the Metropolitan police and I, on his behalf, to put into place a proper procedure for his protection and his wellbeing.\"</p> <p>The Vietnamese legal system had, he said, subjected Gadd to a \"show trial\". He added that Gadd hoped to have an opportunity to test his Vietnamese conviction in a British court. He said his client now had three days to work with the police. </p> <p>A spokesman for the Metropolitan police declined to comment on the case or on whether police protection was being provided. </p> <p>Harry Fletcher, assistant general secretary of the probation union, Napo, said that if reports that Gadd had millions in the bank were correct, any protection was unlikely to come out of the public purse. </p> <p>He added that Gadd's case was different to those of Maxine Carr, the ex-girlfriend of the Soham murderer Ian Huntley, Robert Thompson and Jon Venables, who killed the Liverpool child James Bulger. \"They had their identities changed, but here we have someone in the public eye and in terms of a new identity, you can't really give him one. I would have thought that the police will conclude that the measures they have to put in place will be minimal.\"</p> <p>Some reports yesterday suggested Gadd was considering a move to the West Country. How long he can keep his new location a secret is another question.</p> <h2>Unwelcome traveller</h2> <p><strong>Tuesday, August 19 </strong></p> <p>After being released from jail Gadd leaves Vietnam for Thailand. He refuses to board a connecting flight to Britain but is denied entry to Thailand. </p> <p><strong>Wednesday, August 20 </strong></p> <p>More than 20 hours after arriving in Thailand he boards a flight to Hong Kong. Gadd is refused entry to Hong Kong and returns to Bangkok.</p> <p><strong>Thursday, August 21 </strong></p> <p>Gadd leaves Bangkok on a flight bound for England.</p> <p><strong>Friday, August 22 </strong></p> <p>Gadd arrives in London amid a media frenzy and is met by eight uniformed police officers as he leaves the plane.</p>",

  "<p>Channel 4's marketing director Polly Cochrane has admitted that the broadcaster keeps one eye on influencing the government when it makes ad campaigns supporting its public service programming.</p> <p>Cochrane, speaking as part of a panel at the MediaGuardian Edinburgh International Television Festival, also said she wasn't surprised some research has shown consumers drifiting away from the BBC brand because it has to \"chase people\" for the licence fee.</p> <p>She added that Channel 4 does use marketing to try and balance the view of the channel as home to output such as Big Brother.</p> <p>\"We are trying to counter balance that. And that includes [targeting] the government and ordinary people too,\" she said.</p> <p>Cochrane pointed out that new programmes and in particular public service output, needed marketing support \"otherwise what is the point of making them\".</p> <p>By comparison Big Brother receives around \u00a380m to \u00a3100m of free marketing support from coverage in the media.</p> <p>Cochrane, speaking on a panel that included BBC marketing director Helen Kellie, Wall to Wall managing director Alex Graham and UKTV marketer Tom Lucas, also queried the BBC's brand strength with consumers.</p> <p>\"I've always thought company's that effectively have relationships with consumers where they chase people for money [will affect their brand],\" she said.</p> <p>Her comments came after the issue of research querying whether the consumers were disengaging with the BBC brand was raised.</p> <p>She was subjected to comments from the other panelists that Channel 4 would quite like the licence fee \"top sliced\" to help support the broadcaster's potential funding gap after digital switchover.</p> <p>Cochrane responded that her comments weren't loaded - Channel 4 would prefer a form of \"indirect\" funding over \"top slicing\".</p> <p>She added that the arrival of Channel 4 chief executive Andy Duncan, a former Unilever marketer, had not resulted in any \"interference\" in the marketing department, or of the marketing department muscling in at a programme commissioning level.</p> <p>However, Channel 4's marketing operation does have an input in programme-making to the extent of developing themes for seasons, she added.</p> <p>Cochrane cited seasons of programmes such as Disarming Britain, about gun and knife crime, and the Big Food Fight, as examples of the Channel 4 marketing department's influence. We often may come up with an umbrella theme,\" she said.</p> <p>Graham asked whether the BBC iPlayer might herald the end of channel brands in the digital age.</p> <p>The iPlayer, he said, is increasingly using Amazon-style recommendation systems instead of channel brands for users to discover shows.</p> <p>\"A thirty second channel ident runs before the programmes on the iPlayer,\" Wall added. \"It seems the idents on the on-demand service is the last hurrah of channel marketing in that space. There is a tension between programme brands and channel brands that we haven't seen before\".</p>",
  "<p>Political scientists Stephen Brown, Chandra Lekha Sriram and Marie-Jo\u00eblle Zahar are right in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/20/zimbabwe\">pointing out</a> the perils of a quick-fix power-sharing solution in Zimbabwe.</p> <p>They view a unity government as an untidy and \"inherently undemocratic\" outcome but they are less successful in outlining possible alternatives for ending the political deadlock in Harare. Their suggestion that Zimbabwe should hold fresh elections under a caretaker government is fanciful at best because Robert Mugabe's Zanu-PF party is unlikely to agree to a new poll.</p> <p>In any case it is difficult to see how a credible election can be held in the toxic environment that Mugabe and his shock troops have created in Zimbabwe today. Given Zimbabwe's weak institutions and partisan security forces, fresh elections would do very little to deepen the democratic culture.</p> <p>The international community has been urging the main opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, and his MDC party to push for \"full executive authority\". Although this is desirable, Mugabe and Zanu-PF are unlikely to cede complete control - therefore Tsvangirai needs to take a more realistic approach.</p> <p>Rather than quibbling over what amount of power he will exercise in a new coalition government, the opposition leader might be wiser to demand a framework for genuine reforms under a unity government.</p> <p>Constitutional changes that would shield the judiciary from executive interference and change the current system where judges are handpicked by a compliant Judicial Service Commission, for example, would offer a significant check on the all-powerful presidency. An independent judiciary could be a powerful guarantor of Zimbabwe's democracy down the road while serving as a deterrent to the militias that have wreaked havoc in the country, safe in the knowledge that there would be no consequences for their actions.</p> <p>Similar changes to guarantee the independence of the electoral commission and strip the presidency of powers to appoint its members would be an invaluable tool in safeguarding the integrity of future elections.</p> <p>The impact of genuine reforms would be to insulate Zimbabwe against a reversion to one-man rule, entrench the concept of separation of powers between various arms of government and possibly offer a window for cleaning up the security forces. This would be a far better platform for sustainable change in Zimbabwe than fresh elections in the current poisoned environment.</p> <p>Tsvangirai and the MDC have time on their side, mainly because of coming changes in South Africa where ANC leader Jacob Zuma is expected to replace Thabo Mbeki as president in a year's time. This transition will be uncomfortable for Mugabe and Zanu-PF. The Zimbabwean leader has profited from his close ties to Mbeki with whom, as Mbeki's biographer William Gumede <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/africa/2008/06/tsvangirai-mugabe-zimbabwe\">has noted</a>, he shares a kinship rooted in class and history.</p> <p>Mbeki and Mugabe are both well educated and were involved in the liberation struggle. Tsvangirai, by contrast, is a former trade unionist of modest education who did not take part in the guerrilla movement that helped to end white minority rule, a fact that informs Mbeki and Mugabe's dim view of his suitability to lead.</p> <p>The rise of Zuma - like Tsvangirai a man who has been propelled to his position by the powerful trade unions in South Africa - is likely to change all that. Zuma and other powerful figures within the ANC initially regarded Mugabe with sympathy as he cast himself as a champion resisting neo-colonialism and as a victim of imperial conspiracy. As Mugabe has increasingly turned his guns on his own people in his attempts to cling to power that admiration has given way to revulsion. Where Cosatu, the umbrella body of South African trade unions, was once a keen supporter of Mugabe, its members are now more likely to be found leading demonstrations against him. Zuma has also been far more strident in his <a href=\"http://www.zimdaily.com/news/zuma22.4911.html\">public criticisms</a> of Mugabe than Mbeki, a fact which does not portend well for the Zanu-PF leaders.</p> <p>Considering the leverage that South Africa has over Zimbabwe's leadership, it is inconceivable that under a Zuma presidency Mugabe would be able to get away with the virtual impunity he has exercised under Mbeki's watch.</p> <p>If, on the other hand, Tsvangirai refuses to take part in a unity government, his stance could give Zanu-PF an opportunity to go ahead with a unilateral arrangement that excludes the main opposition leader and present this to the rest of Africa as a <em>fait accompli</em> borne of the opposition's intransigence.</p> <p>A lot of commentators have drawn parallels between the deal Mugabe wants to strike with Tsvangirai and the 1987 <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7558578.stm\">unity government</a> with another former trade unionist, Joshua Nkomo. That arrangement ended unhappily for Nkomo whose Zapu party was overshadowed by Zanu and whose career never recovered.</p> <p>But Mugabe may be looking further back into history as he discusses a new coalition government. The state media in the last few weeks have been &lt; a href=\"http://www.herald.co.zw/inside.aspx?sectid=817&amp;cat=1\"&gt;actively supporting a deal that would see Mugabe enter a coalition with the smaller MDC faction led by Arthur Mutambara. Zanu-PF would then attempt to poach opposition MPs with offers of front bench positions to maintain control of parliament. With the Zimbabwean national assembly convening on Tuesday, the next few weeks could yield movements in this direction.</p> <p>Such an arrangement would have echoes of the deal struck between Bishop Abel Muzorewa and the Ian Smith regime in 1979. Smith hoped to freeze out what he viewed as the more radical liberation movement players such as Mugabe and Nkomo by working with Muzorewa. It was a desperate attempt to hold on to power and it did not ultimately succeed. Mugabe's attempt will similarly fail in the long run, though in the short term it will keep him in power while deepening the economic crisis in Zimbabwe.</p> <p>The MDC has few real options outside some form of unity government, but it must insist on enough guarantees to ensure a process of reform with an eye to the Mugabe succession.</p> <p>If nothing else, this arrangement will help to pave the way for badly-needed investment to help lift the economic siege that has enveloped Zimbabwe under Zanu-PF rule. Unlike the politicians, the suffering masses do not have time on their side.</p>",
  "<p>A coalition of scientists and advocates from 105 environmental groups across the US is pressing the Bush administration to allow more public input before it restructures the country's endangered species law.</p> <p>Environmentalists got a shock to the system 10 days ago when the Bush administration revealed it would end the 35-year-old requirement that government agencies consult with independent scientists before building roads, dams or mines that could harm threatened species.</p> <p>The interior secretary who proposed the rule, Dirk Kempthorne, defended the move as necessary to make sure climate change is not used to justify more endangered species protections. Activists cried foul, accusing the Bush administration of launching a \"sneak attack\" on wildlife during its last days in office.</p> <p>But what made the Bush administration's plans even more alarming to environmentalists was the limited outreach that Kempthorne's department plans to do before changing the endangered species law.</p> <p>Every US government agency must seek public comment on a rules change before making it. Comments are generally accepted for several months -- but the species protections are scheduled to pass after only 30 days of discussion.</p> <p>\"It appears as if the [Bush] administration is doing whatever it can to discourage participation in the democratic process,\" National Wildlife Federation executive director John Kostyack said.</p> <p>\"I think we can expect more sneaky assaults like this on our public land and wildlife laws as this administration heads for the exits.\"</p> <p>In addition, public comments will only be accepted by mail or through a government website that automatically shares one's personal information. The limited comments could prevent green groups from generating mass opposition to the new rule via fax and email.</p> <p>While they battle to prevent the species law from being changed, environmental groups are also pushing for Kempthorne to open up the process and allow the public greater say over wildlife protections.</p> <p>\"The abbreviated timeline and restrictive commenting options raise serious concerns that the department of the interior is attempting to rewrite a bedrock environmental statute without allowing for adequate public involvement,\" 105 environmental groups wrote in a letter to Kempthorne yesterday.</p> <p>The groups also urged Kempthorne to hold public hearings on the new rule where advocates from both sides of the endangered species debate could exchange views.</p> <p>Signers of the letter hail from nearly every state in America and a cornucopia of scientific institutions, from the Gulf Restoration Network to the Missouri Botanical Garden to California Trout Incorporated.</p>",
  "<p>Israel warned tonight that an attempt by peace activists to sail two boats to the Gaza Strip was a \"provocation\" and said it would consider \"all options\" to prevent them reaching their destination.</p> <p>A group of 46 activists set sail this morning from Cyprus and were hoping to reach Gaza tomorrow to challenge the economic blockade Israel has imposed on the territory, as well as delivering a cargo of 200 hearing aids for a deaf school and 5,000 balloons. </p> <p>Among those on board is Lauren Booth, Tony Blair's sister-in-law. \"I've been nervous, but today I'm excited,\" said Booth, 41, shortly before the boats sailed. \"It's not about our fear, it's about the people waiting in Gaza. You can't think about anything else.\"</p> <p>Israel has already warned the two boats not to undertake the journey and tonight Aviv Shiron, the spokesman for Israel's foreign ministry, said the journey was a \"provocation\" and that \"all options\" were under consideration to prevent the boats reaching Gaza.</p> <p>It appears most likely that there will be a standoff with the Israeli authorities tomorrow and that the activists will be arrested rather than allowed into Gaza.</p> <p>Although Israel withdrew its soldiers and settlers in 2005, it still controls Gaza's air space and sea space, as well as nearly all the border crossings. </p> <p>Until a recent ceasefire with Hamas - the Islamist group that won Palestinian elections more than two years ago and now controls Gaza - the Israeli military was mounting regular incursions into the territory, saying it wanted to stop rocket fire into southern Israel. It has imposed a tight economic blockade aimed at weakening Hamas.</p> <p>In a statement issued as they departed today, the activists said they would lodge a legal protest against any attempt by the Israelis to arrest them.</p> <p>\"If Israel chooses to forcibly stop and search our ships, we will not forcibly resist,\" they said. \"If we are arrested and brought to Israel, we will protest and prosecute our kidnapping in the appropriate forums ... It is our purpose to show the power that ordinary citizens of the world have when they organise together to stand against injustice.\"</p>",
  "<p>In the academic world, as in the world at large, there are data, statistics, charts, correlations and formulae. These methods, of course, have great value. They allow us to take a macro view of significant public problems and see patterns that can lead to informed decision-making.</p> <p>Such an approach has informed much of our public policy on the subject of alcohol over the past 25 years. We have studied and restudied traffic fatalities, rates of binge drinking and brain development. Even when the findings are inconsistent, even contradictory, we have tried to frame policies whose effects can be best measured by more data, statistics, charts, correlations and formulae.</p> <p>But also in the academic world, as in the world at large, behind every individual statistic is a human story, and sometimes those stories, individually and even cumulatively, challenge what the supposedly objective data appear to show.</p> <p>This reality, too, has informed how we view alcohol and its effects, and it is this increasingly frequent conflict - between what science purports to show us and what experience in fact demonstrates - that we might locate the current debate over the effects of America's 21-year-old drinking age.</p> <p>US <a href=\"http://alcoholpolicy.niaaa.nih.gov/index.asp?SEC=%7B9937ACFC-DB3A-4159-B068-A302CEEE0EDF%7D&amp;Type=B_BASIC\">law</a> is quite clear: if you are under 21, you may not consume alcohol. And yet the vast majority of young people, whether in college or not, consume alcohol long before they turn 21. Supporters of the law continue to invoke science. Those who question the law invoke experience. Science, it is argued, supports a law that makes abstinence and enforcement the only tools a parent or a university may employ on young violators, whose numbers are vast and whose ingenuity in avoiding detection is increasingly acute. Experience, on the other hand, suggests that \"just say no\" and \"we will enforce the law without exception\" are not the most effective ways to enable young adults to make responsible decisions about alcohol.</p> <p>Yet science can be tricky. Alcohol-related traffic fatalities <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/26/washington/26highway.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;oref=slogin\">reached a 10-year high</a> in 2006. Fatalities in Puerto Rico, where the drinking age is 18, <a href=\"http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/Pubs/811017.PDF\">dropped by 11% last year</a> (pdf). Half of the peer-reviewed studies on the effect of the drinking age on fatalities show a positive correlation. Half show no correlation at all.</p> <p>College and university presidents are on the front lines. <a href=\"http://www.amethystinitiative.org/signatories/\">More than 120</a> have signed on to the <a href=\"http://www.amethystinitiative.org/\">Amethyst Initiative</a>. The Initiative does not take a position on what the drinking age should be. But it does <a href=\"http://www.amethystinitiative.org/statement/\">state</a> that legal age 21 has wrought significant unintended consequences that simply must be examined with care. These include binge drinking, the possession of fake IDs, the frustrating difficulty of enforcement and the ineffectiveness of the abstinence-only message.</p> <p>The drinking age has effectively banished alcohol from public places and public view. But it has done little to reduce drinking. If you were to design the ideal venue for binge drinking, you would not design a student union, a dining hall, a restaurant or any public gathering place. You would instead design a locked dorm room, an off-campus apartment, a farmer's field - in short, a place conducive to clandestine behaviour. </p> <p>And that is exactly where binge drinking is taking place, in the most risky of environments. Ironically, the more successful a college is in enforcing the law - carding underage drinkers, braceleting those of legal age, limiting quantities, posting campus security - the greater the likelihood that alcohol consumption will simply move to a place out of campus sight and often beyond campus boundaries, effectively placing that behaviour out of reach of campus authority.</p> <p>The result? More than <a href=\"http://www.collegedrinkingprevention.gov/media/Journal/136-Hingson.sep.pdf\">1,000 lives of 18-24 year olds</a> (pdf) are being lost each year to alcohol off the highways, and this number is increasing.</p> <p>Supporters of the law continue to urge abstinence and enforcement. Such an approach makes no allowance for human judgment or discretion, for a consideration of the unique circumstances that surround every incident that ultimately becomes another impersonal piece of data. The 120 Amethyst presidents find these limitations immensely frustrating. They inhibit their institutions' ability to do what they do best, which is to educate.</p> <p>Not everyone may agree that the drinking age should be changed. But it is hard to argue against discussion and debate. And those who would seek to stifle debate by bullying presidents into removing their names and urging parents not to send their children to the institutions represented on the Amethyst list need to be called out and reminded that this is not the way a civilised debate should be conducted.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gJmv4POXDyupBSnJm_7w4h5xawtw\">extraordinary public reaction</a> to the Amethyst Initiative suggests that the debate needs to happen, that opinion is not all on one side of the question and thus that the question is thus far from settled. That is why 120 courageous academic leaders have put the Amethyst statement forward and why the debate that ensues will lead to public policy that reflects the reality of the lives young adults lead.</p>",
  "<p>The Chinese authorities have detained a Briton for 10 days for her part in a Free Tibet protest. Details emerged today of her arrest overnight as Gordon Brown arrived in Beijing for the Olympics.</p> <p>Downing Street said it did not comment \"on individual consulate cases\". But it is understood the prime minister has taken up Mandie McKeown's case amid a flurry of activity behind the scenes. </p> <p>The embassy has been in touch with McKeown and her family to check that she is being looked after properly.</p> <p>The 41-year-old mother of two from Bristol was arrested just after midnight as she filmed three others from the group Students for a Free Tibet - two from the US and a German of Tibetan origin. They had unfurled a Tibetan flag and shouted slogans near the Bird's Nest stadium. The three men are also thought to have been detained.</p> <p>While other foreign protesters trying to use the Olympics to highlight human rights issues have been deported immediately, McKeown is expected to serve 10 days in a detention centre before being sent back to the UK.</p> <p>Her husband, Dan Carey, 42, said she left for China about three weeks ago and was due back on Sunday. He last spoke to her more than two days ago and was concerned for her wellbeing. The British embassy had contacted her and established she was being treated well.</p> <p>\"It's the not knowing \u2026 it's alarming not being able to have contact with her, it's worrying,\" said Carey. </p> <p>He said that his wife, a fundraiser for not-for-profit organisations, had been involved with the Free Tibet cause for 10 years and had gone to China as a monitor rather than to take part in direct protest.</p> <p>\"It's a cause she is passionate about and she has been for some time. It was important for her to be involved in this and she was aware that she might be arrested,\" he said.</p> <p>He said he hoped that while attending the closing ceremony Brown would be \"aware and thinking that she's held and asking appropriate questions\".</p> <p>Brown is bound to face renewed questions over China's record on human rights and political expression in light of McKeown's case. </p> <p>Critics including the Liberal Democrat leader, Nick Clegg, have urged him not to attend the closing ceremony, even though it marks the formal handover to London as the next Olympic host.</p> <p>The Olympics minister, Tessa Jowell, has criticised the British media for running <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/aug/22/politicsandsport.olympics2012\">too many negative stories about China</a> that fail to recognise the progress the country has made.</p> <p>The Chinese authorities appear to have toughened their stance on foreign protesters following a series of SFT demonstrations during the games. Yesterday, police said six American activists would serve 10 days for \"upsetting social order\".</p> <p>Initially protesters were simply deported, with one group even reporting being fed KFC meals as they waited. But foreigners are still treated far more leniently than domestic activists.

  "<p>In another one of those gotcha moments in this presidential campaign of never-ending gotcha moments, John McCain's bullies, er, surrogates, are <a href=\"http://www.nysun.com/national/obama-adviser-offers-some-advice-to-damascus/84260/\">going after one of Barack Obama's Middle East advisers</a> because he - get this - attended a conference hosted by the American Bar Association in Syria. </p> <p>During the visit he - again, get this - encouraged the Syrian foreign minister to advance the Israel-Syria peace negotiations, a policy publicly embraced by Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert. Omigod, where does Dan Kurtzer get the unmitigated chutzpah to agree with the stated policy of an Israeli government? Call out the dogs, something must be done, off with his head!</p> <p>The McCainites even had the audacity to accuse Kurtzer of pursuing his own negotiations with Syria, suggesting in a conference call, according to the JTA , that <a href=\"http://www.jta.org/cgi-bin/iowa/breaking/110025.html\">Kurtzer was engaged in covert negotiations</a> with Syria.</p> <p>What else irks McCain and other neocons? The conference was organised in part by the <a href=\"http://www.britishsyriansociety.org/\">British Syrian Society</a>, whose founder is Bashir Assad's father-in-law. Also, the funding for the conference came in part from Syrian corporations and a Canadian oil company. This of course means both Kurtzer and Obama are in the pocket of the Syrians:</p> <blockquote> <p>The Foundation for the Defence of Democracies' Tony Badran said the conference Mr Kurtzer attended in Damascus was part of a Syrian campaign to build up good will with the west. ... \"It's not a secret that the Syrians are openly banking on Barack Obama. It's not surprising that they would build bridges in advance and do this through the window of the peace process.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Getting lost in the hue and cry is the subject of the conference Kurtzer attended, which was strengthening the rule of law in Syrian society. I guess McCain doesn't much care for it.</p> <p>Michael Goldfarb, McCain's deputy communications director, got off a medium-quality zinger about the trip: \"If one of senator Obama's advisers has been to Damascus, we just wonder how many have been to Tehran.\"</p> <p>Heaven forbid that the McCain campaign should understand that Syria and Iran are quite different countries with much different sets of interests and that Syria, unlike Iran, has actually shown great interest in breaking out of its alliance with Iran and joining the west. And God forbid that Obama should send representatives to meet the Iranians. Imagine what could happen? Peace might break out and then where would the neocon agenda be? They lost the Evil Empire in 1989. They lost Saddam. Now they have Iran. It reminds me of the old saying: \"If there was no God, humans would have to invent Him.\" What will they do when they don't have Iran to demonise?</p> <p>JTA nicely pointed out that each of the McCain attack dogs who excoriated Kurtzer - Rudy Giuliani and Randy Scheunemann - aren't exactly choir boys when it comes to being bought and paid for lobbyists for shabby foreign governments:</p> <blockquote> <p>They said this did not compare to Giuliani's law firm's past representation of Citgo, the Venezuela-owned oil refiner, and of the Saudi oil ministry, nor with Scheunemann's past lobbying for Georgia. Scheunemann said his lobbying and Giuliani's lawyering were all part of the public record, although Giuliani's clients were uncovered by the Associated Press last year after his own presidential campaign declined disclosure requests.</p> <p>\"It is no secret, in fact it's known openly that I worked for the Georgians,\" Scheunemann said. \"It was a secret until this story broke that Ambassador Kurtzer before he accompanied senator Obama on his Middle East trip was in Syria talking to senior Syrian officials.\" It's not clear that Kurtzer made any effort to hide the visit. </p> <p>The Obama campaign accused the McCain campaign of hypocrisy. \"Senator McCain's top aide, Charlie Black, was paid to lobby on behalf of dictators guilty of terrible human rights abuses, and the McCain campaign throws a fit about an unpaid adviser encouraging progress in the ongoing Israeli-Syrian peace talks during his free time?\" Tommy Vietor, an Obama spokesman, said in an email message. He was referring to Black's past lobbying for Angolan, Somali, Zairean and other figures.</p> </blockquote> <p>This is one of those bizarre moments in a presidential campaign. A candidate's representative actually makes a small, quiet, well-meaning gesture to advance the cause of peace. And all hell breaks loose. What does McCain want? One hundred years of hatred between the US and Syria (like the 100 years of war in Iraq he's prepared to accept)? A perpetual alliance between Iran and Syria against Israel? Lebanon eternally torn asunder by warring sects? Is that what his policy would be?</p> <p>Given that Scheunemann was one of the original neocon proponents of overthrowing Saddam and that Giuliani campaign adviser Norman Podhoretz advocated nuking Iran, my guess is that they and McCain would be quite satisfied with the US on a perpetual war footing against some enemy or another. Call it winning and governing by fear. Bush has perfected the art, though he's been faltering lately, and fewer Americans seem to be buying it. Which is why this McCain gotcha moment will, with any luck, have the shelf life of a piece of day-old bread. But you just never know. This campaign is just crazy enough that this matter could resonate with some voters.</p> <p>The McCain campaign is practicing a particularly lame form of wedge politics to pander to pro-Israel Jewish voters. But perhaps someone should tell McCain that a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/25/israelandthepalestinians.usforeignpolicy\">J Street poll</a> reveals that 58% of American Jews favour a deal between Israel and Syria that involves giving up the Golan in return for full peace with Syria - precisely the purpose of the peace talks Kurtzer was attempting to advance. I guess McCain believes he'll score a few points with the 42% who don't favour such a deal between Israel and Syria. That's an awfully small wedge if you ask me.</p>",

They'll be posted every Friday on guardian.co.uk/film at 5pm \u2013 and you can watch episode one right here. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336882108\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/08/22/howtolose300220.jpg\" alt=\"Simon Pegg in How to Lose Friends and Alienate People\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Simon Pegg (and perhaps Minnie, just out of shot) in How to Lose Friends and Alienate People</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It's a cliche I know, but we had a lot of fun making this film. That definitely comes through in the blogs; it's not a searing account of one man's journey into the heart of darkness, more a glimpse at the lighter side of the film making process. My involvement in How to Lose Friends was strictly as an actor, differing from my contribution to films such as Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz. </p> <p>It's a little odd to work so intensively on a project without any production responsibility but it's undeniably refreshing to hand over the reigns. I did stay in close contact with the film's director and venerable Curb Your Enthusiasm co-creator Bob Weide, during the edit, though. It's not easy being a control freak.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336881870\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/08/22/simon460220.jpg\" alt=\"Simon Pegg in How to Lose Friends and Alienate People\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Simon Pegg in How to Lose Friends and Alienate People</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><br>The shoot was a blast from start to finish. It was hard work and extremely intensive but this was made all the easier by the people involved. Bob and I hit it off back when we were discussing my involvement in the project, so I had a friend going in, which always helps. I'd been informed of Kirsten Dunst's involvement at the beginning of the year whilst on the Hot Fuzz press tour of the US. We crossed paths in LA a week or so later whilst she was on Webslinger press duties at the Four Seasons Hotel. I liked her immediately. She was friendly and unassuming and got on well with Nick Frost, which is usually my benchmark for judging people. </p> <p>We became good friends during the shoot. She is the product of that odd collision between wisdom and youth. An actress since she was three years old, she demonstrates experience and professionalism, coupled with a healthy understanding of the nature of the business. She is also one of the most instinctively gifted actresses I have ever had the pleasure of working with. I'm a fan. Does it show?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336881871\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/08/22/peggspaced1469220.jpg\" alt=\"Spaced co-stars: Simon Pegg and Jessica Stevenson\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spaced co-stars Simon Pegg and Jessica Stevenson. Photo: Graeme Robertson</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The cast was filled out with similarly exciting prospects. Jeff Bridges, a legend and an incredibly generous actor had me quivering with excitement every time he walked onto set (look out for a tense game of Pass The Pigs between Jeff, Bob and me in a future installment). Gillian Anderson, so long the object of a huge fanboy crush of mine, is brilliantly icy as New York queen of PR, Eleanor Johnson in the movie but warm and funny and fun off set (I played it cool). </p> <p>Danny Huston, a man who I don't recall ever seeing not smiling is like me, a giggler, a condition which always causes exquisite anxiety when the cameras are rolling. And of course, Megan Fox, an actress all too easy to underestimate, due to her striking beauty but one who definitely proves her worth as the \"so hot right now\" ingenue Sophie Maes. This was a group of people who made getting out of bed at 5.45am as easy as falling asleep 16 hours later.</p> <p>The shoot happened to take place just as a new arrival joined the Pegg family. Minnie the Miniature Schnauzer was a mere nine weeks old when I first brought her onto set but she took to the movie industry with enthusiasm and ease. Watch out for her first experience of the great outdoors and her controversial sacking from the movie in later blogs. I don't care what Bob says, she's going to be a star.</p> <p>Although the movie is based on Toby Young's personal memoir, I play Sydney Young, a distinction that afforded me some freedom with the role, rather than a duty to impersonate Mr. Young. Similarly Peter Straughan's sharp and funny script is very much an adaptation of the original text, inspired by events rather than a straight account. Despite this, I have no doubt whatsoever that Toby will be at pains to stress that the film is an exact account of his life. That's just how Toby is and to be perfectly honest, I don't blame him. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336881872\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/08/22/peggshaun220.jpg\" alt=\"Simon Pegg in Shaun of the Dead\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Simon Pegg in Shaun of the Dead</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><br>Early in the shoot, Toby approached Kirsten on set and asked if she had fallen in love with him yet, after which he proceeded to give her a performance note. This might have been charming if they had been formally introduced but they hadn't. As it was, I believe her response was an understandable, \"Who the fuck's this guy?\" Bob told me that he had received an email from Toby that night saying, \"It's going to be really difficult for me to come on set and not get involved.\" Bob sent him a reply saying that there was an easy solution to that problem. We didn't really see Toby on set again after that.</p> <p>A typical shooting day for me would start before six. I'd creep out of the house with Minnie in her special travel box and meet my driver Barry outside. Barry has driven me since Shaun of the Dead. Over the years we have worked out a system that really works for us. Barry never rings the doorbell, he parks up outside, more often than not having picked me up a coffee and a copy of The Guardian on the way and waits for me to emerge at my designated call time which I generally do with pinpoint accuracy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336881873\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/08/22/pegghotfuzz220.jpg\" alt=\"Simon Pegg in Hot Fuzz\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Simon Pegg in Hot Fuzz</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I then clamber into the passenger seat in various states of consciousness and we listen to the Xfm breakfast show and set the world to rights. I have only once failed to come out at the right time and that was when the clocks went forward and I didn't realise. Barry wakes up earlier and goes to bed later than anyone else on the crew and when I'm shooting, he is always the reason for my first smile of the day. Barry I salute you. </p> <p>Having arrived at location, Henry the base runner would fetch me breakfast, whilst I settled Minnie before going into make up. Once in the chair Jane Walker, who has looked after me since Spaced and knows my hair and skin better than anyone, makes me look the part whilst I do the quick crossword at the back of the G2 (when production moved to New York, producer Stephen Woolley arranged to have The Guardian delivered to me each day so I could maintain my ritual, a gesture for which I remain grateful). </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336881874\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/08/22/peggrun460220.jpg\" alt=\"Simon Pegg in Run Fatboy Run\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Simon Pegg in Run Fatboy Run</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Once made up and in costume, we would go down to set and line up the first shot, then return to our trailers whilst the set was being lit by ace D.O.P. Oliver Stapleton and his crew. This would take about 40 minutes which gave me enough time to play with Minnie and hang out with Kirsten and her PA/best buddy Liat and drink a lot of coffee. We'd repeat this process until lunch time, have an hour or so's break, then carry on until wrap (wind, reel and print) at 8pm. This went on for about three months and I enjoyed every minute of it.</p> <p>Here then, in the run up to the release of How To Lose Friends And Alienate People, is a little glimpse into how it all got made. I'm pretty sure it's spoiler free and won't spoil your eventual enjoyment of the film itself, which is brilliant. Jesus, I sound like Toby.</p>",
  "<p><strong>A LOVELY TURN OF PHRASE ABOUT COINS, RIGHT HERE</strong></p> <p>Most Saturdays the Fiver gets up around 5am. And gets out of bed 10 or 11 hours later. Fortunately we can do several things badly at once, so tomorrow we may just watch what promises to be a bed-wetting Olympic Football final between Leo Messi's Argentina and Victor Anichebe's Nigeria. With both countries going for gold, what better time to give another wearing to our limited-edition Henry Kelly pyjama and bow-tie combo, bought as a tribute to <a href=\" http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\" kvkewv20nik\" \">the great man</a>'s immaculate side-parting (and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2004/feb/14/politicalcolumnists.guardiancolumnists\">righteous riling of r@cist South Africans</a>.</p> <p>The match-up may be a repeat of the 1996 final, when victory went to a Nigerian side inspired by Jay-Jay Okocha and Firewall Kanu, but that didn't stop Nigeria coach Samson Siasia hollering: \"The players know this is a once-in-a-lifetime chance for them - in fact, it's even rarer than that.\" Many of the players form both sides also featured in the 2005 Under-20 World Cup final, when Argentina prevailed. \"In 2005, they got two penalties because my defenders were na\u00efve and easily fell for their tricks,\" fumed Siasia. \"It's time to pay Argentina back in their own coins.\"</p> <p>Argentina may have spanked Brazil 3-0 in the semis but Siasia reckons his Eagles - who dumped on Belgium 4-1 - will triumph in Beijing. \"The Argentines should be worried about this team,\" he roared, before explaining: \"We have fast strikers and there is no way they can stop us.\" Argentina ringleader Sergio Batista, meanwhile, insisted his lads were so good they make him feel like invading a Middle Eastern country to plunder its oil and poison its land. \"With these players I'd be brave enough to fight in Iraq,\" said the manager of a nation whose only gold medal in the games so far was awarded in the men's Madison, which sounds suspiciously like a massage parlour for effete line-dancers.</p> <p>*********************</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"Last year we sold Martin Skrtel to Liverpool for \u00a310m, and now probably Andrei Arshavin will go to Spurs\" - Zenit St Petersburg coach D1ck Advocaat opens the door to Tottenham, while claiming his club trousered nearly twice as much for Skrtel than the \u00a36m Liverpool claimed they paid. Should this be true, it begs the question: could it be possible that Robbie Keane cost Liverpool the best part of \u00a340m?</p> <p>*********************</p> <p><strong>KEANE TO ASK THE BIG QUESTIONS</strong></p> <p>When the Fiver saw Team GB BMX bandit Shanaze Reade blow a guaranteed Olympic silver or bronze this morning in an audacious attempt to win gold or bust, she took top spot on our podium of Favourite Competitor at Beijing 2008 (not including that Russian girl in Women Jumping With Long Stick). But it wasn't to be Shanaze's day, because a couple of hours later, losing boxing semi-finalist Paddy Barnes gave his post-fight interview and immediately knocked her off her perch. \"There's no question I lost the fight, but the judges were a disgrace. They should be docked points ... this is the worst country in the world, they shouldn't even be hosting the Games,\" jabbered Barnes with no little justification, as out-of-shot BBC reporter Garry Richardson audibly winced.</p> <p>But sensing a good story, the notoriously hard-nosed newsman set about stoking the fire with his standard issue Big Investigative BBC Stick: \"Well at least you won a medal,\" he simpered, anxious not to offend his jovial Chinese hosts. \"I don't care. They can keep it for all I care,\" replied Barnes heroically, felling his pathetic interrogator with a knockout blow. </p> <p>And listening to the exchange, the Fiver couldn't help but wonder if the chippy, handy-with-his-fists Irishman [Isn't that all Irishmen? - Fiver Ed] who was voicing his contempt for incompetent officialdom and finishing anywhere other than didn't remind him of somebody. A certain Premier League manager, perhaps, with a similarly incomprehensible brogue? Then it finally dawned on us - it's 10 minutes to pub time and we've a paragraph about some of this weekend's Premier League action, any of this weekend's Premier League action, to write.</p> <p>\"With our away form last year, I'm pretty sure Tottenham are looking forward to us coming to London, but hopefully we can improve,\" said Sunderland manager Roy Keane, who for reasons we can't quite fathom, we decided to randomly quote despite having 19 other top flight managers to choose from. \"The players I have brought in have got experience of playing in the Premier League and we lacked that last year.\" Of course, if top BBC newshound Garry Richardson had been present, he could have asked Keane if it wasn't also true that most of the players he's brought in have also got experience of playing for Spurs. Or simpered something to the effect that \"at least you finished 15th last season\" and waited for the ensuing funk.</p> <p>*********************</p> <p><strong>GUARDIAN FANTASY FOOTBALL</strong></p> <p>There's lots of boring formations to choose from, so click <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fantasyfootball\">here</a>, then sign up for the Fiver's Friends' League (League Name: The Fiver.

  "<p>If you want a glimpse of how the movement against climate change could crumble faster than a summer snowflake, read <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/21/climatechange.kingsnorthclimatecamp?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=commentisfree\">Ewa Jasiewicz's article</a>, published yesterday on Comment is free. It is a fine example of the identity politics that plagued direct action movements during the 1990s, and from which the new generation of activists has so far been mercifully free. </p> <p>Jasiewicz rightly celebrates the leaderless, autonomous model of organising that has made this movement so effective. The two climate camps I have attended \u2013 this year and last \u2013 were among the most inspiring events I've ever witnessed. I am awed by the people who organised them, who managed to create, under extraordinary pressure, safe, functioning, delightful spaces in which we could debate the issues and plan the actions which thrust Heathrow and Kingsnorth into the public eye. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/kingsnorthclimatecamp\">Climate camp</a> is a tribute to the anarchist politics that Jasiewicz supports. </p> <p>But in seeking to extrapolate from this experience to a wider social plan, she makes two grave errors. The first is to confuse ends and means. She claims to want to stop global warming, but she makes that task 100 times harder by rejecting all state and corporate solutions. It seems to me that what she really wants to do is to create an anarchist utopia, and to use climate change as an excuse to engineer it. </p> <p>Stopping runaway climate change must take precedence over every other aim. Everyone in this movement knows that there is very little time: the window of opportunity in which we can prevent two degrees of warming is closing fast. We have to use all the resources we can lay hands on, and these must include both governments and corporations. Or perhaps she intends to build the installations required to turn the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/aug/16/energy.householdbills\">energy economy</a> around \u2013 wind farms, wave machines, solar thermal plants in the Sahara, new grid connections and public transport systems \u2013 herself? </p> <p>Her article is a terrifying example of the ability some people have to put politics first and facts second when confronting the greatest challenge humanity now faces. The facts are as follows. Runaway climate change is bearing down on us fast. We require a massive political and economic response to prevent it. Governments and corporations, whether we like it or not, currently control both money and power. Unless we manage to mobilise them, we stand a snowball's chance in climate hell of stopping the collapse of the biosphere. Jasiewicz would ignore all these inconvenient truths because they conflict with her politics. </p> <p>\"Changing our sources of energy without changing our sources of economic and political power\", she asserts, \"will not make a difference. Neither coal nor nuclear are the 'solution', we need a revolution.\" So before we are allowed to begin cutting greenhouse gas emissions, we must first overthrow all governments and corporations and replace them with autonomous communities of happy campers. All this must take place within a couple of months, as there is so little time in which we could prevent two degrees of warming. This is magical thinking of the most desperate kind. If I were an executive of E.ON or Exxon, I would be delighted by this political posturing, as it provides a marvellous distraction from our real aims. </p> <p>To support her argument, Jasiewicz misrepresents what I said at climate camp. She claims that I \"confessed not knowing where to turn next to solve the issues of how to generate the changes necessary to shift our sources of energy, production and consumption\". I confessed nothing of the kind. In my book Heat, I spell out what is required to bring about a 90% cut in emissions by 2030. Instead I confessed that I don't know how to solve the problem of capitalism without resorting to totalitarianism. </p> <p>The issue is that capitalism involves lending money at interest. If you lend at 5%, then one of two things must happen. Either the money supply must increase by 5%, or the velocity of circulation must increase by 5%. In either case, if this growth is not met by a concomitant increase in the supply of goods and services, it becomes inflationary and the system collapses. But a perpetual increase in the supply of goods and services will eventually destroy the biosphere. So how do we stall this process? Even when usurers were put to death and condemned to perpetual damnation, the practice couldn't be stamped out. Only the communist states managed it, through the extreme use of the state control Jasiewicz professes to hate. I don't yet have an answer to this conundrum. Does she? </p> <p>Yes, let us fight both corporate power and the undemocratic tendencies of the state. Yes, let us try to crack the problem of capitalism and then fight for a different system. But let us not confuse this task with the immediate need to stop two degrees of warming, or allow it to interfere with the carbon cuts that have to begin now. </p> <p>Jasiewicz's second grave error is to imagine that society could be turned into a giant climate camp. Anarchism is a great means of organising a self-elected community of like-minded people. It is a disastrous means of organising a planet. Most anarchists envisage their system as the means by which the oppressed can free themselves from persecution. But if everyone is to be free from the coercive power of the state, this must apply to the oppressors as well as the oppressed. The richest and most powerful communities on earth \u2013 be they geographical communities or communities of interest \u2013 will be as unrestrained by external forces as the poorest and weakest. As a friend of mine put it, \"when the anarchist utopia arrives, the first thing that will happen is that every Daily Mail reader in the country will pick up a gun and go and kill the nearest hippy\".</p> <p>This is why, though both sides furiously deny it, the outcome of both market fundamentalism and anarchism, if applied universally, is identical. The anarchists' associate with the oppressed, the market fundamentalists with the oppressors. But by eliminating the state, both remove such restraints as prevent the strong from crushing the weak. Ours is not a choice between government and no government. It is a choice between government and the mafia.</p> <p>Over the past year I have been working with groups of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/11/kingsnorthclimatecamp.activists\">climate protesters</a> who have changed my view of what could be achieved. Most of them are under 30, and they bring to this issue a clear-headedness and pragmatism that I have never encountered in direct action movements before. They are prepared to take <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/12/climatechange.police\">extraordinary risks</a> to try to defend the biosphere from the corporations, governments and social trends which threaten to make it uninhabitable. They do so for one reason only: that they love the world and fear for its future. It would be a tragedy if, through the efforts of people like Jasiewicz, they were to be diverted from this urgent task into the identity politics that have wrecked so many movements.</p>",
  "<p>I'm a sucker for the latest \"must-read\" political book. And so I've just finished Nudge: Improving Decisions about Health, Wealth and Happiness by Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein, the 293-page tome which is proving hugely influential with the Conservatives.</p> <p>The basic idea is that by using insights from behavioural economics governments can influence people's conduct without using compulsion. It's easy to see why this appeals to Tory policy makers, because nudges are cheap and they don't involve \"nanny state\" bans, and plenty of good articles have been written about it already (like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/jul/12/economy.conservatives\">this one, by Aditya Chakrabortty, in the Guardian</a>). </p> <p>If you're really interested, you should read the book. But, if you haven't got the time or the inclination, you might still find it worth knowing some Nudge jargon, the language Thaler and Cass use to describe their theories. As a service to readers, I've compiled a list.<br><strong><br>Libertarian paternalism:</strong> This is the key concept. Nudgers are paternalistic, because they want to make life better for people. But they are libertarians too \u2013 they don't like compulsion.</p> <p><strong>Non-libertarian paternalists:</strong> The opposite. Politicians who like passing laws banning things.</p> <p><strong>Choice architect:</strong> Anyone who influences the way people make choices, when they go to the shops, or fill in a form, by presenting the choices in a certain way. \"Rigging the questions\" would be a more cynical way of describing it. Choice architects are everywhere \u2013 you're probably reading this blog as a result of the headline used by the choice architect in charge of this page on the website. Politicians are choice architects too, although some of them probably don't realise it. Thaler and Sunstein think that if they did understand this, they would do their jobs better.</p> <p><strong>Econs and Humans:</strong> Economists (and some conventional policy makers) tend to work on the assumption that people act rationally and that they always do what's best for them. Thaler and Sunstein call people who actually behave like this Econs. Real people, who don't always act rationally, are called Humans.</p> <p><strong>Status quo bias:</strong> A fancy way of saying people don't like change and tend to accept what's offered.</p> <p><strong>Collective conservatism:</strong> The tendency for a group of people to carry on doing what they've done before; ie what happens when status quo bias applies collectively.</p> <p><strong>Automatic system/Reflective system:</strong> Two systems used for thinking. The automatic involves gut reactions, or learnt behaviour; the reflective involves reasoning. We all use both, in different situations. (Thaler and Sunstein say voting normally involves the automatic system, which is bad news of politicians who try to win using complex arguments.)</p> <p><strong>Mere-measurement effect:</strong> A type of nudge. It refers to the fact that, when people are asked what they intend to do in a survey, they are more likely to go and do it. Canvassing exploits the mere-measurement effect because evidence shows that if you ask someone the day before an election how they intend to vote, the chance of their voting increases by 25%.</p> <p><strong>RECAP:</strong> Stands for Record, Evaluate and Compare Alternative Prices. Another type of nudge. Thaler and Sunstein suggest that, in cases where consumers find it difficult to decide which product offers best value (ie with mobile phone charges), companies should be forced to publish information making meaningful comparisons possible.</p> <p><strong>Third Way:</strong> Not the Tony Blair version. Thaler and Sunstein claim their approach offers \"a real Third Way\" between the Republican obsession with free markets and the Democrat belief in command-and-control regulation.</p>",
  "<p><strong>What's your favourite piece of technology?</strong><br>My multi-room <a href=\"http://www.sonos.com\">Sonos music system</a> \u2013 which consists of small wireless white boxes in each room hooked up to speakers.

  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> Barcelona. <br> <strong>The lineup:</strong> Pablo Diaz-Reixa (instruments, samples). <br> <strong>The background:</strong> There has been a lot of talk recently about bands incorporating elements of Afrobeat into what they do to give their musical a tropical flavour. El Guincho \u2013 real name Pablo Diaz-Reixa, a 24-year-old son of an environmental inspector for the government of the Canary Islands who once won a prize for his magic realist writings \u2013 is no dilettante dabbler dipping his toes into tropical waters. What he does isn't really rock music at all; if anything this is carnivalesque, sampladelic pan-ethnic music with elements of rock and pop rather than vice versa. It's danceable and infectious but quite hard to assimilate in one or two listens. El Guincho is Spanish, Cuban actually, for \"seagull\", but really, Diaz-Reixa is a magpie, picking and mixing from a variety of sources but operating away from the pop exigencies of melody and metre, rhythm and rhyme, creating fluid pieces of music that you will struggle to remember because they lack conventional hooks and choruses. They are sufficiently hypnotic in their linear motion that you might get swept away by the tribal beats, the polyglot chants, the polyrhythmic abandon, the sheer polyphonic spree, but you're unlikely to be humming any of the songs at the bus-stop from El Guincho's debut album, Alegranza, although it's well-titled: it means \"joy\".<br> Most musicians loathe being labelled but Diaz-Reixa has a pigeonhole he's quite happy to sit in: \"space-age exotica\", a neat way of capturing this modern yet timeless music, made on computers but featuring sounds as old as time. His intention was to make a sort of salsa with synths, combining traditional Caribbean song, calypso, the gypsy essence of Gogol Bordello, the late-50s avant-lounge muzak of Juan Garcia Esquivel and late-60s Brazilian \"tropicalia\", adopting the sampling techniques of hip hop and the poignant yet playful approach of current experimental acts like Panda Bear and Animal Collective. You won't believe your ears: Palmitos Park opens with the sound of a village cheering before doo wop harmonies enter the fray. Antillas is like King Sunny Ade meets Sun Ra. With its pulsating peasant chants, Cuando Maravilla Fui is like rustic rave. Buenos Matromonios Ahi Fuera starts with offshore winds, tinkling percussion and kids chanting in a playground, only to become a sort of underwater kraut-dub. Fata Morgana comes in bright, swirly, psychedelic Technicolor, all looped string riffs and abstracted background wails, a strange kind of anthem. Kalise hops madly, relentlessly, towards a panoramic cloudburst of multitracked \"ah ah ah!\"s, as sublime a moment as you'll hear this year. There's plenty here that would work in clubs: the clattering tribal drums of Costa Paraiso are as mesmeric and undeniable as anything by early-80s voodoo-funk collective 23 Skidoo while Prez Lagarto sounds like several floats-worth of musicians at next weekend's Notting Hill carnival squashed into one song.  <strong>The buzz:</strong> \"A one-man festival.\"<br> <strong>The truth:</strong> There is, indeed, so much going on here that it's hard to believe it's the work of one man and his trusty MPC500. <br> <strong>Most likely to:</strong> Make you pine for South America and inquisitive about Spanish. <br> <strong>Least likely to:</strong> Make you pine for the Spanish Inquisition.<br> <strong>What to buy:</strong> Debut album Alegranza is released by Young Turks on October 6. <br> <strong>File next to:</strong> Animal Collective, Panda Bear, Os Mutantes, Esquivel.<br> <strong>Links:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/elguincho\">www.myspace.com/elguincho</a><br> <strong>Monday's new band:</strong> Anthoney Wright.</p>",
  "<p>Since the Office for National Statistics launched the new population figures which show there are now <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/22/population.socialtrends\">more older people over 65 than children under 16</a>, there have been a number of lurid headlines about \"Ancient Britain\". While these new numbers might well give people pause for thought, the phenomenon of an ageing society has been a reality for some time.</p> <p>Policymakers now have to redouble their efforts. This isn't just about having to pay out more state pensions \u2013 what these new statistics should do is lay down the gauntlet to ministers, local authorities and businesses to think through how \"age friendly\" they are and what adaptations need to be made to cater for the society of today \u2013 and tomorrow.</p> <p>How will home builders rise to this challenge? The government has published a <a href=\"http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/housing/lifetimehomesneighbourhoods\">national strategy on lifetime homes</a> which calls for all new builds to meet standards of accessibility and adaptability \u2013 new homes will need to be constructed that have fewer steps, light switches at lower levels for wheelchair users and so on.</p> <p>What of the erosion of our local communities? Should there not be more benches fitted onto streets? And, all too often, the public toilets which so many of us rely on as we're out and about have faced the axe, leading to many older people now feeling afraid to venture out for fear of being \"caught short\" \u2013 the growth of an ageing society means this decline in facilities must be arrested. Help the Aged has already set up our <a href=\"http://policy.helptheaged.org.uk/NR/rdonlyres/ee27krkejfyzwckj2rt66t4syfaxnk3bq6mpqeibyjwaxs52gotc43k3aniivrbk6omltd7g2y674pp4ummu3ovjeba/towardscommonground290408.pdf\">Towards Common Ground (pdf)</a> manifesto, calling on local councils to better think through the implications of their cost-cutting policies on how communities cater for older people.</p> <p>It's not just in the area of public accessibility where these demographic changes matter. Despite recent changes to the law, it is still perfectly legal to force someone to retire at 65. If our country wishes to remain an economic powerhouse, a more flexible approach to work is an urgent requirement \u2013 and that includes the scrapping of mandatory retirement at 65. </p> <p>In fact, the attitude of society has got to change too. Older people are still the butt of ageist jokes, are still considered by too many people as doddery, needing help and intensive care \u2013 victims of a social care system that's creaking at the seams and needs urgent reform. </p> <p>As a country, we do not celebrate age as other cultures do. Even among businesses and commercial enterprises, the \"grey market\" is too often passed over, which from a purely profit-centred view is folly. Products and services are too often designed for the \"youth market\". Help the Aged is currently working, through its engage network, with a number of businesses to address this, assisting them in adapting their business models and products to meet the needs of this rapidly ageing society. If you're a hard-pressed chief executive worrying about your bottom-line, there's a lot to be said for tapping into the older market.</p> <p>These new figures have made people sit up and notice the fact of our ageing society. But it's happening all around us and it is happening fast. Sitting back and inventing headlines like \"Grey Britain\" might get a laugh \u2013 but the policy challenges involved in meeting this societal change are immense.</p>",
  "<p>In a hotel in Louisville once, I overheard the guests in the lift. They were attending the Kentucky state convention of colonic hydrotherapists. At the time, I wondered: What do they <em>do</em> in their hotel rooms between sessions?</p> <p>Last week I wondered if I could get them into joint session with the American Publishers' Association, whose members definitely need their colons washed out. I had been writing an essay for the Common Review in Chicago on second world war revisionism and had just finished the bibliography.<br> Check out some of the titles I cited. Clive Ponting's <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Armageddon-Reality-Behind-Distortions-Illusions/dp/0679436022\">Armageddon: The Reality Behind the Distortions, Myths, Lies and Illusion of World War II</a>; Nicholson Baker's <a href=\"http://www.simonsays.com/content/book.cfm?tab=1&amp;pid=616619&amp;er=9781416567844\">Human Smoke: The Beginnings of World War II, the End of Civilisation</a>; Patrick Buchanan's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/01/usforeignpolicy.usa\">Churchill, Hitler and the Unnecessary War: How Britain Lost its Empire and the West Lost the World</a>.</p> <p>You will note: Notwithstanding the fall of empire, there is a rampant high tide of colonisation. You will also detect an agenda. These books are trying to tell or warn potential buyers that they will not be getting the conventional \"good war\" fought by the \"greatest generation\". <br> David McCullough's publishers felt no need to rename his book <a href=\"http://www.penguin.co.uk/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9780141021713,00.html\">1776</a>: The War in Which the Brits May Not Have Been Quite as Evil and King George Not Quite as Tyrannical as Our School Histories and Walt Disney Told Us. <br> Colons have been a staple of academic publishers for many years. After all, no academic ever lost tenure by stinting on words. Certainly, with some published theses you get the impression that the academic assessors weighed them in the balance \u2013 literally. And their titles reflect it. Now they have colonised even popular non-fiction titles like those above, and I can testify that publishers adorned my own books with subtitles. They felt that short, pithy titles like <a href=\"http://www.almstrade.com/\">The Alms Trade</a>, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Rum-Sociable-History-Ian-Williams/dp/1560258918\">Rum</a> or <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Deserter-Bushs-Military-Families-Veterans/dp/1560256273\">Deserter</a> all needed a mini-foreword to be pinned to them.<br> Indeed, word is that the internet is making it worse. Publishers want to put as many keywords in the title as possible to get the click-on traffic for online buyers. However, this expansion used to be mostly for non-fiction titles. Now Nicholson Baker is breaking the boundaries. His Human Smoke tries to get the best of both worlds, a creative Dos Passos cut-and-paste-style work masquerading as history. Most historians, even tendentious ones, may have mentioned Hitler's part in declaring war on the US. Baker's addition of the colonial subtitle lends a spurious historicity and academic rectitude to his polemic, while dangerously introducing the colon to creative works. Think of what would have happened to George Orwell's snappy title. 1984: One Man's Discovery that Big Brother is Indeed Big but Hardly Fraternal and that Sex with Comrades Can Have Torturous Consequences.  You can forgive Herman Melville for adding \"or, The Whale\", to Moby Dick, since, firstly it has no colon, and secondly, when he published it no one would have had a clue what it was all about. However, Moby Dick: How Ishmael Lost His Shipmates and Found His Soul While Chasing Jungian Archetypes Around the Globe and Carrying Out Experimental Marine Mammal Research, does not really cut the wasabi for the sushi.  Better still, imagine trying to get a plot summary behind a colon for one of Dickens's discursive novels, or for that matter, imagine summarising War and Peace in a snappy subtitle. No, it's all gone too far. We must all cleanse our colons.</p>",
  "<p>Russian troops have started withdrawing from the city of Gori, Georgia's security council chief said today. </p> <p>Alexander Lomaia made the announcement at about 4pm local time but it will not be possible for the pledge by the Russian president, Dmitry Medvedev, to remove all troops by the end of today to be met.</p> <p>The confirmation of the start of the Russian withdrawal came after Gori's regional governor, Vladimir Vardzelashvili, said 40 Russian military vehicles had left the city, heading north to South Ossetia.<br> However, a Russian general has warned that it could be 10 days before the bulk of Russian troops have left Georgia. </p> <p>Their departure from Gori was met with joy among the population. \"It's such a relief,\" said one 68-year-old resident. \"I was waiting for this day and finally I see the Russians leaving my home town. I'm so happy.\"</p> <p>Gori's position, deep within Georgian territory, made it a strategically important place to hold for the Russians and they had dug in, running checkpoints outside the city and on Georgia's main east-to-west road, which skirts the city. </p> <p>Earlier, the UN's top official for refugees called for people who had fled the conflict in South Ossetia to be allowed to return home.</p> <p>In the first visit to Georgia's breakaway province by a senior UN official, the high commissioner for refugees, Antonio Guterres, and the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, agreed on the principle that all civilians should have the right to return home, a UNHCR statement said.</p> <p>The UN estimates 158,000 people have been displaced since fighting broke out on August 7 over South Ossetia. About 80,000 displaced people are being housed in more than 600 centres in and around the Georgian capital, Tbilisi. </p> <p>More than $11m (\u00a35.9m) in aid has been flown in, such as prepared meals, blankets, cots, mattresses and portable showers.</p> <p>Humanitarian aid is getting to Gori, but Henrietta Fore, the head of USAid, said the Russian military must open safe corridors to let aid workers and more supplies get through. Workers did manage to get into Gori yesterday to hand out supplies. \"The distribution of food and hygiene kits went well \u2014 that is just one day, but it's a step in the right direction,\" Fore said.</p> <p>She said USAid's own people must be allowed into the Russian-held area to increase supplies and assess the situation. \"We've been calling on the Russians for access,\" she said, adding there had not been a reply.</p> <p>In Igoeti, a major checkpoint on the road from Tbilisi to Gori, Russian troops were allowing aid organisations and local traffic through. Red Cross vehicles, mine-clearing jeeps and trucks carrying peaches were seen heading into Gori.</p> <p>Further west, near a base at the key Black Sea port of Poti, Russian troops were seen digging large trenches by a bridge that provides the only access to the city. Five trucks, several armoured personnel carriers and a helicopter were parked nearby. Another Russian position was seen in woods outside the city.</p> <p>Lomaia said Russia's control of key roads aimed to \"suffocate us economically\" and \"steer anger among the population, which can be channelled toward the government of this country\".</p> <p>While refugees from the fighting crammed Georgian schools and office buildings in and around Tbilisi, a scattering of people left in deserted villages were badly in need of basics.</p> <p>\"There is no bread, there is no food, no medicine. People are dying,\" said Nina Meladze, 45, in the village of Nadarbazevi, outside Gori. She stayed while others fled to Tbilisi because she could not leave elderly relatives. </p> <p>She said the village had been virtually abandoned since the war broke out. <br>\"I cannot go on like this any more, I cry every day,\" she said.</p> <p>The UN security council has remained deadlocked over Georgia, unable to agree on a resolution or statement on the crisis, which erupted two weeks ago. </p> <p>Russia has put a draft resolution before the council endorsing a six-point peace plan brokered by Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president. </p> <p>Western countries say the Russian draft is unacceptable as it does not mention Georgia's territorial integrity or spell out where Russian forces will be deployed in future. Most importantly, the west says, Russia has so far made no substantial withdrawal.</p>",

  "<p>It's rare to have the luxury of a grand prix where we can't confidently predict who might triumph, but the playing field (if not the bumpy streets of Valencia) should be more horizontal than normal this weekend. It's amusing to picture the teams scrabbling round building computer games and apparently despatching secret drivers to compete in the only previous race to be held at the new port circuit \u2013 a Spanish Formula 3 and GT meeting a couple of weeks ago. Formula one teams crave control, order and predictability, something they don't have for this race.</p> <p>Some drivers, like Kimi Raikkonen, profess to hate all that simulator shtick and will be happy just to turn up and get stuck into learning the circuit from the best possible place \u2013 the cockpit. Others, the kind who normally would only get the chance of decent points if a bout of salmonella hit the paddock catering trucks, will see themselves as the wild cards. It's races like this where common sense tells you that experience counts \u2013 but does it?</p> <p>The man leading the world championship, by five points, is only in his second season. His four victories last year taught us that (if you have the natural talent) you don't have to do your time before you can get your mitts on the silverware. Since those four wins were not rounded off at the season's end with the drivers' title, you must concede that experience is necessary when it comes to the big prize, if not on a round-by-round basis.</p> <p>At Valencia this weekend, it won't just be the usual suspects thinking of a podium place. Take Adrian Sutil's performance in the Monaco grand prix \u2013 where the teams have oodles of data - when he was running fourth until punted from behind by Raikkonen. Had misfortune befallen anyone ahead he would have been in the prime spot for a trophy. When the usual formula one script goes awry, talented drivers will shine \u2013 no matter how many races they lack to their rivals. Witness Toro Rosso's Sebastien Vettel setting the fastest time in first practice today at Valencia, when veteran David Coulthard slid off.</p> <p>The flip side of this is that the sport's elder statesmen, when presented with an opportunity, have to prove they're worth the years of investment. Nick Heidfeld (in his ninth season) and Mark Webber (in his seventh) might be eyeing up this race for their first victory and perhaps persuading their strategists to think outside the box. With a lack of run-off and concrete barriers, this race could be a magnet for safety car periods, and some clever fuel strategies and racing nous could deliver that unpredictable outcome. Just ask Nelson Piquet Jr.</p> <h2>Barrichello's road is long</h2> <p>Talking of experience (or, rather, self belief) the man with more grand prix starts to his name than any other driver in formula one history has reiterated that he wants to continue racking up the miles next year. Honda driver Rubens Barrichello could be out of a job if the team manages to secure Fernando Alonso, as it hopes to, on a one-year deal. \"The team is definitely talking to Fernando but that's the question mark,\" said the Brazilian. \"I have never been so enthusiastic about my whole situation with the team. The day that I feel that I am slower than my first race is the day I will call it off and stop.\" That debut race was back in 1993. Not many people would claim they're as fast at anything as they were 16 years ago.</p> <h2>Last weekend's action</h2> <p>Fabrizio Giovanardi has such a big points lead in the British Touring Car Championship drivers' standings that he can afford a joke or two. He declared himself a monkey chasing the banana of Jason Plato's yellow SEAT at Knockhill. Plato, who trails Giovanardi by a margin that is all but impossible to reduce, won the first two encounters \u2013 but his Italian rival followed him home for second both times. The third win went to Plato's team-mate Darren Turner as SEAT became the first team since Team Dynamics in 2006 to win all three races in a day.</p> <h2>This weekend's action</h2> <p>Oliver Turvey was playing it cool in the first half of the British F3 season, but now he's snatched the lead of the championship and is hurtling down the final straight to glory. His recent Spa disappointment \u2013 winning one race but suffering engine failure from the pole position grid slot \u2013 was made up for at Silverstone last weekend with a pair of stunning wins. The recently-acknowledged Cambridge Blue takes on a different street circuit, in Bucharest, this Sunday. There are just four races to go and Sergio Perez and Jaime Alguersuari will need to try everything they can to stop him in Romania.</p>",

  "<p>At the end of a gruelling day's competition, Heather Fell won silver for Britain in the women's modern pentathlon. She was beaten to gold by Germany's Lena Schonenborn. Fell started the final event, the 3km cross country run, needing to make up 19 seconds to move into first place. Fatigued as she was by the four previous events, she was unable to make up the gap and finished 10 seconds back.</p> <p>Schoneborn had led through most of the day, and after Fell's best event, the showjumping, ended in mild disappointment, it was always unlikely that she would be able to make up the necessary points in the run. It was a fantastic result for Fell nonetheless, as she beat the reigning world and Olympic champions. The Ukraine's Victoria Tereshuk won the bronze.</p> <p>With the horses being drawn at random from a pool, Fell was unfortunate to get the only animal described as \"lazy\" in the official guide. She rode excellently in the circumstances, toppling just two fences and incurring a penalty for each. Schoneborn however was even better, extending her lead in first place with a round in which she picked up just a single penalty.</p> <p>Fell had been consistent through the morning events, but outstanding only in the 200m freestyle swim. She shot 185 out of a possible 200 in the 10m pistol, which placed her sixth. Her performance in the single touch epee fencing was good enough to move her up to joint third, as she won 20 of her 35 bouts.</p> <p>By then though, Schoneborn had a 60-point lead over the field, having won an astonishing 28 of her fencing bouts. While her swimming was weaker than that of either of the two Britons, it wasn't so poor as to seriously hinder her position.</p> <p>Fell was third fastest in the pool, with a time of 2:12:77. That was inside Amelie Caze's Olympic record for the discipline, a feat achieved by four other competitors, including Caze. The fastest finisher was the USA's Sheila Taormina, who won a gold medal in the event as part of the 4x100m relay team in 1996, and trimmed some six seconds off that record.</p> <p>Having competed in the triathlon at the Sydney Olympics, Taormina became the first woman in history to contest three different events at three different Games. Her lack of ability with the epee meant she was out of contention for the medals, though she was one of just three riders to produce a flawless round in the showjump.</p> <p>Fell's British teammate Katy Livingston endured a poor first two events, shooting 172 and winning just 17 matches in the fencing. It left her with too much to do in the three later events, and despite her excellent swimming and showjumping she started the 3km race a full minute off the lead. She finished seventh overall.<br></p>",

Then Alfonso Thomas and Charl Willoughby went to consecutive deliveries, both caught in the covers, although not before Thomas with 43, had recorded his highest score since joining Somerset. His stand with Blackwell, who batted for 263 minutes and faced 214 balls, was worth 88. Hurry had hoped that a lead of 150 would give his bowlers time to apply pressure, but no bowler has got anything out of this slow wicket so far.

  "<p>First published in The Observer in August 2008: click to enlarge. </p> <p>Keith Hackett's official answers:<br><strong>1) </strong>A bizarre set of circumstances, but your action is clear. First, the defender has committed an act of violent conduct so you should show him the red card. Second, play is restarted with an indirect free\u2011kick to the opposition from the point where the offence was committed. Third, the actions of the midfielder are beyond your control. It is up to his manager to remove him from the game. <br><strong>2)</strong> Make it clear to the team's manager that the player has been sent off, and do not allow a sub to replace him. The foul gesture means the player is dismissed in line with Law 12, offence number 6. And even if you didn't consider the player's gesture to the crowd to be a seriously offensive one, it would still be a bookable action, which would still result in a dismissal: this first yellow card would immediately be followed by a second for the offence of leaving the field of play without permission. So the player is sent off either way. <br><strong>3)</strong> The goalkeeper hasn't committed an offence. Technically the young forward may be correct, but you must referee within the spirit of the game and use some common sense.

  "<p>Argentina face Nigeria tomorrow in the men's Olympic football final hoping to remain gold medallists. It is the third time that the countries have met in a final: in Atlanta in 1996, Nwankwo Kanu lead Nigeria to gold as they defeated Argentina 3-2. In 2005, in the Under-20 World Cup played in Holland, a young Argentine named Lionel Messi helped his side beat Nigeria, scoring two goals to Nigeria's one. In that tournament, Argentina's squad contained Sergio 'Kun' Ag\u00fcero, Fernando Gago, Oscar Ustari, Pablo Zabaleta and Ezequiel Garay. All of these players are in the squad representing the nation in China this time round.</p> <p>After defeating Brazil 3-0 earlier this week, the mood in Argentina is one of confidence. A correspondent of Clar\u00edn newspaper claims the true hero of the country's turn of luck (Argentina have been consistently losing to Brazil recently, with the exception of a draw in the latest World Cup qualifier) is not the sensational Ag\u00fcero, who scored twice against Brazil, nor Messi, whom Pel\u00e9 categorically described this week as \"the next best in the world\", nor Angel di Mar\u00eda - \"the revelation of the Olympics\", as they call him in Argentina. It wasn't the reliable Javier Mascherano, who has made an invaluable contribution during this campaign. And not even Juan Riquelme - the much-discussed 'link-man' par excellence of modern Argentine football.</p> <p>No, according to Clarin the hero of the hour is manager Sergio 'Checho' Batista. As a player he picked up the 1986 World Cup alongside Diego Maradona, and his assistants H\u00e9ctor Enrique and Jos\u00e9 Luis 'Tata' Brown. As a manager, he took over the youth divisions of the Argentine FA and this is his first performance at a major tournament.</p> <p>Following the motto 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it', the Argentine press are speculating that the line-up for the final will be much like the team fielded against Brazil, with the exception of Ustari, the injured goalkeeper. After the historic victory over Brazil, Batista was quoted by one paper as saying: \"With these players I'd be brave enough to play anywhere\" and by another as adding: \"With these players I'd be brave enough to fight in Iraq.\"</p> <p>It is clear Batista feels he has a squad ready for anything. Before the tournament started, he was already relishing the prospect of leading such a fine ensemble. There was something of a paradox, I put it to him, that in this finest exposition of the most noble aspects of sport - youth and amateurism - he was in charge of some of the world's most expensive and well-established professionals. \"It's hard to think of them as children,\" I said, \"although they're close.\"</p> <p>Batista, straight-faced, said he could hardly feel anything but pride at being able to pick such a fine crop. But his real job for the AFA is to oversee the development of children and youth players in Argentina, and to groom the next generation of world-class teenagers. The Olympic squad, in a sense, he has inherited. He took the position looking further into the future, and wants to stage a revolution in the country's approach to football.</p> <p>\"In Argentina we are making some mistakes,\" he told me. \"We are emulating things that take us further away from our football. And we are depriving children of their childhood. There is too much emphasis on work in the gym, on weight-training and speed. And too much pressure on kids as young as seven or eight to win. This is not good.\"</p> <p>\"The child is not treated as a child,\" Batista argues. \"I believe strongly in respecting the stages - there is a time when you have to play for fun, enjoy the game. Argentina's strong point has always been technique. If you look at the best players in Europe, they are always the ones who are technically excellent. Gyms and machines can never give you what keepy-uppies and contact with the ball do for a child.\"</p> <p>Worryingly for Argentina, the World Cup winner believes the country is losing players faster than it is producing them. We discuss the example of Gago, who left Boca Juniors for Real Madrid and was immediately replaced in Boca's midfield by Ever Banega, who was then sold to Villarreal after less than a season. \"But look at Ag\u00fcero\" he adds with indignation. \"Ag\u00fcero has still not been replaced at Independiente.\"</p> <p>For the players it is a no-brainer to go in search of riches at the bigger clubs, says Batista. The economic incentive is very real. \"When I was a player I got an offer from Tenerife but is was only \u00a3100,000 more than I was making, so I could afford to stay put. Nowadays, the difference in wages is too much to ignore.\" He wants to implement a system that will groom even more technically gifted players so that the domestic league isn't left with gaping holes in the crucial positions.</p> <p>And the key to it all is technique. \"Ag\u00fcero may be worth \u00a3100m. Messi may be worth \u00a3100m. Gago may be worth \u00a3100m, Banega may be worth \u00a3100m \u2026 and back home clubs and youth workers are still insisting on sending kids to the gym. They don't realise that the value of those professionals is that they are technically rich, not because they have bodies built to show off muscle on the beach. But we don't see that back home. These boys have a lot of ball training behind them as kids. That's their technical richness.\"</p> <p>\"It's not possible that if Riquelme isn't playing for Argentina, the squad has to line up completely differently because there isn't another enganche [hook],\" he says with exasperation. \"Why, if we have always played with an enganche are we increasingly forming 4-4-2? It is because we are emulating stuff from other places, which is not our way of playing.\"</p> <p>If Batista returns to the AFA's headquarters with the gold medal, his chances of being given more freedom to implement his revolution will increase. We may once again see eight or nine-year-old enganches able to control the ball on the ground, caress her and treat her well. His tenure in youth development has yet to start in earnest - these Olympics are an excellent start but, Batista himself recognises, they are an exponent of established professionals rather than the fruits of his ideology.</p> <p>And if Nigeria win? \"Look, we have to win the Olympics. That's what we came for. But if we don't, I'm not going to stab myself. I still understand that this is a game.\"</p>",
  "<p>We have probably all had our fill of witnessing the <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/aug/22/childprotection1\">excruciating spectacle</a> of Paul Gadd/Gary Glitter <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/22/childprotection.thailand\">playing musical planes</a> to avoid returning to London for a life of running from tabloid newshounds. Many of us have certainly stomached enough of the home secretary, Jacqui Smith's \"tough talking\" in her <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article4566821.ece\">carefully planned</a> press interviews announcing yet more clampdowns on sex offenders. <br> The Home Office has legislated almost every year of the last 11 on sex offenders. But government failure to effectively implement the changes in law means children can only be considered marginally safer. It is high time the home secretary stopped congratulating herself \u2013 agreeing press releases announcing tough new laws is one thing: making the laws work is the hard part.</p> <p>The Home Office proudly <a href=\" http://press.homeoffice.gov.uk/press-releases/Stopping-Sex-Offenders\">proclaims</a>: \"the UK has some of the toughest laws in the world for sex offenders.\" Aside from the US, that may be so. There is certainly an extensive range of practical options that could be deployed against these offenders, but the enforcement agencies are failing to do so. A <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/aug/18/ukcrime\">report published</a> last weekend by Ecpat (End Child Prostitution, Child Pornography and the Trafficking of Children for Sexual Purposes) accuses the government of \"turning a blind eye to the dozens of British sex offenders who travel or work abroad\". <br> <a href=\" http://www.ecpat.org.uk/\">Ecpat</a> (a coalition of leading children's charities, including NSPCC, Save the Children, Unicef UK and the Children's Society) expose the fact that only five foreign travel orders (FTOs) have ever been imposed by the British courts. British offenders on the sex offender's register are still now legally able to travel abroad for three days without any declaration to the police. Many travel to meet paedophile networks in eastern Europe for weekends abusing children, although the government has announced in the last few days its intention to close this loophole later this year. As Ecpat say: \"The British government has failed to prevent child sex tourism despite having laws in place for over 10 years.\"<br> The Ecpat report <a href=\"http://www.ecpat.org.uk/press_01.html\"> Return to Sender</a> highlights a pattern of sweeping legislative changes from government without showing the commitment to make an actual difference to the protection of children. For example, since 2001, the multi-agency public protection arrangements (MAPPA), has been a \"holistic approach\" where police, probation and housing agencies manage Britain's 35,000 released sex offenders. As Professor <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/18/ukcrime.childprotection\">David Wilson</a> of Birmingham University stated on Cif on Monday, MAPPA is a recognised \"world-beater\" as a model for risk management. However it remains totally unfunded. The government line on the \"close monitoring of offenders\" is a myth \u2013 very often there are several months between police visits.<br> The sex offender's register, established in 1997, was a groundbreaking development, but the list of countries with a comparable system of recording offenders' movements (the US, Australia) remains pitifully small. Christine Beddoe, director of Ecpat UK, says: </p> <blockquote> <p>The government must take immediate steps to develop bi-lateral cooperation agreements and joint investigations with other countries to return sex offenders to the UK and give clear guidance on when travel bans should be used to protect the world's most vulnerable children.</p> </blockquote> <p>The minister in the Home Office responsible for sex offenders, Vernon Coaker, has already announced more measures \"to send a tough message to deter travelling sex tourists\". Sex offenders are well aware not all acts of abuse are specific crimes in every country; the age of consent varies widely in Europe alone. Coaker said UK nationals who commit a sexual offence abroad would be prosecuted regardless of whether it was an <a href=\"http://www.politics.co.uk/news/opinion-former-index/policing-and-crime/uk-sex-tourists-face-new-laws-$1231162.htm\">offence</a> in the other country. But offenders who are prosecuted abroad and are deported back here after serving their sentence are still not required to sign the sex offender's register. They are free to travel and abuse children abroad again. The Ecpat report refers to a 77-year-old British offender who has been arrested six times in Thailand since 1991, for various serious offences. Yet despite this, he was free to travel back there again in March, when he was arrested for abusing an eight-year-old boy.<br> Gadd/Glitter has a previous offence of child pornography so he must re-sign the sex offender's register, and we are assured \"will face up to five years in jail if he does keep to the rules\". The reality is somewhat different; nearly all non-compliers are simply fined, often less than \u00a3100. Perhaps we should be more understanding of the government; after all Coaker, despite being a parliamentary under-secretary, the lowest rank of minister, has an astonishingly heavy portfolio. He is responsible for all policy on sexual assault, gun and knife crime, domestic violence, victims of crime, antisocial behaviour and the entire drugs strategy. Sympathy might be more forthcoming if the government could show they were listening to the experts in child protection. The most significant recent programme of work by the government on sex offenders was the <a href=\" http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/documents/CSOR/\">child sex offender review</a>. It was commissioned by the then home secretary, John Reid, in 2006 to implement a \"Sarah's law\" where police would be required to provide individuals such as single mothers with details of convicted sex offenders living in the community who could have access to their children.<br> Reid asserted \"this information should not be the sole preserve of officialdom\" and for months bathed in the populist adulation afforded him by the News of the World. When children's charities, the police and probation service were consulted, they almost unanimously advised against and cried out for adequate resources for integrated public protection systems like MAPPA. Reid's officials pointed to the thoroughly negative experience from the US of \"Megan's law\" where in many states, a threatening community has driven the 'registration compliance rates' of sex offenders below 70%. In Britain, according to Association of Chief Police Officers, 97% of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2006/jan/18/childrensservices.politics1\">offenders comply</a> with the sex offender's register. A missing offender is an unmanaged offender and is a greater risk to children. In spite of such fierce opposition, the pilots for Sarah's law will start across four English police forces in a few weeks.<br> Timing further announcements around the time of Gadd's release has reinforced the public's false view that most sex offenders are strangers and predators. All child protection charities agree that at least 80% of offenders are known to the victim and very often are family members. For parents, grandparents and guardians, protection of our children ranks highest of our priorities. To play these political games is pretty shameful.</p>",

Russia has put a draft resolution before the council endorsing a six-point peace plan brokered by Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president.

  "<p>As a US government programme kicks in to help mortgage holders hit by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/subprimecrisis\">the country's biggest bank failure</a> in more than 20 years, the collapse of IndyMac Bancorp has become embroiled in an alleged smear campaign targeting a Democratic politician.</p> <p>Mortgage customers of the now government-controlled IndyMac Federal Bank are becoming test cases for a state-sponsored foreclosure salvation plan that it is hoped will become a model for private lenders. </p> <p>The US government agency, the <a href=\"http://www.fdic.gov/consumers/loans/modification/indymac.html\">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</a>, which took control of IndyMac on July 11 after depositors withdrew more than $1.3bn over 11 days, is offering fixed rate loans at roughly 6.5% to tens of thousands of IndyMac customers with payments based on their actual incomes. </p> <p>There are some 40,000 people who had mortgages with the bank. The homeowners were originally given mortgages without providing too much documentation. </p> <p>\"By providing long-term sustainable payments, this program will reduce future defaults, improve the value of the mortgages, and cut servicing costs. Our goal is to get the greatest recovery possible on loans in default or in danger of default, while helping troubled borrowers remain in their homes. I believe we achieve that with this framework,\" said FDIC chairman Sheila Bair</p> <p>In the meantime questions are being asked about what caused the run on the bank. California's attorney general, former Democratic Governor, Jerry Brown, is reviewing a request by former employees of IndyMac to investigate whether a letter from New York senator, Chuck Schumer, to the FDIC questioning the bank's viability triggered its collapse. </p> <p>In the letter to Jerry Brown 51 former IndyMac workers wrote: \"From the day (Schumer's) letter was made public on June 26 until the closure of the bank, a run on the bank took place and the failure became inevitable.\"</p> <p>Brown's office is reviewing the letter and a decision on whether to act on it may be made next week.</p> <p>However, the letter's origins have raised suspicions among Democrats. The ex-employees' letter was distributed by CRC Public Relations, the firm behind the company that published a book questioning 2004 Democratic party presidential candidate John Kerry's Vietnam service.</p> <p>This led to <a href=\"http://bigpicture.typepad.com/comments/2008/08/indymac-strikes.html\">comments from Barry Ritholtz</a> on his blog The Big Picture: \"It wasn't the conflicts of interest, the outright fraud, or management's rampant criminality that sent IndyMac belly up. It wasn't losing nearly a billion dollars this year alone. It wasn't the share prices tumbling 87% in 2007, and then losing another 95% this year-to-date. And of course, the loss of $30 billion dollars had nothing to do with this.</p> <p>\"It was the Senator's letter in June that was the cause of the collapse.\"</p> <p>Senator Schumer said after the collapse the Bush administration is trying to \"blame the fire on the person who calls 9-1-1\"</p>",
  "<p>Oliver Stone's W is apparently going to be a highly controversial movie in the States, although one suspects that on this side of the pond it will simply reinforce negative perspectives of the current US president. US TV show Access Hollywood has been given a pretty impressive inside look at the unfinished film, and it is looking even more like a hatchet job than <a href=\"http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/film/2008/06/w_poster.html\">when the first poster arrived on the interweb</a>.</p> <p>Take a look at the clip above, which shows rehearsals for a scene in which Bush claims that the Iraq war is over. I think Brolin has absolutely nailed the sing-song cadence of Dubya's vocal mannerisms, and isn't far off on emulating his physicality. Of course he doesn't look very much like Bush, but perhaps that's not the most important factor here.</p> <p>Slash film has <a href=\"http://www.slashfilm.com/2008/08/20/more-behind-the-scenes-of-oliver-stones-w/\">another Access Hollywood featurette</a>, which includes an interview with Brolin about his initial reluctance to take the role. Stone also talks about his admitted anti-Bush bias and his determination to film a fair portrayal of the president despite it.</p> <p>Meanwhile, and with perfect timing, <a href=\"http://cinemablend.com/new/Frost-Nixon-Trailer-9913.html\">the first trailer for the similarly themed Frost/Nixon has hit the web</a>, featuring Frank Langella as the disgraced US president Richard Nixon, who decided to risk a series of TV interviews with supposedly soft British TV personality David Frost three years after the Watergate scandal and got the shock of his life.</p> <p>The trailer does a good job of setting up the importance of the interviews, given Nixon's apparent immunity from prosecution. Langella, who honed his act with the same role in the identically titled Peter Morgan play upon which the film is based, sounds bizarrely like Sean Connery to me, though, but there is perhaps <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJs80eBGYlM\">a slight twang there in the real life version too</a>.</p> <p>Does it matter if Brolin and Langella pull off perfect impersonations? With these kind of films isn't the message the important thing, rather than the lead actor's ability to mimic their subject? Or do you disagree? How will Langella's performance compare to Anthony Hopkins' Oscar-nominated take in Stone's own Nixon?</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p><strong>Hello</strong></p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p><strong>Rob will be here from 1.30pm or so.</strong></p> <!-- Block 3 --> <p><strong>Afternoon, yeah?</strong> I've never been much of a fan of having the one-day series after the Tests \u2013 you wouldn't have your pressed foie gras with Sauternes and camomile reduction, pickled garlic, grilled focaccia after your line caught turbot fillet studded with Perigord truffle, boulang\u00e8re potatoes, leek ballottine and civet sauce, would you now \u2013 but the very reason the system is so flawed should work in England's favour for this series.</p> <p>As Duncan Fletcher pointed out <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/20/newlook_england_can_scoop_odi.html\">the other day</a>, invariably the team that ends the Tests with an actual or moral victory struggle in the subsequent one-dayers, because of inherent difficulties such AS THE RANK LACK OF PROFESSIONALISM THAT PRECLUDES THEM FROM RAISING THEIR GAME ALL THE TIME.</p> <p>So that psychological quirk might level things up a bit, because there's no doubt South Africa (2nd in the world) are a better side than England (7th). It's a really big series for England, and especially their coach Peter McClaren. He's no bigamist, of that we're sure, but he has had a lot of honeymoons lately. The first came when he took the job; the second when England symbolically started a new era by axing Steve Harmison and Matthew Hoggard in New Zealand; and the third when Kevin Pietersen took over as captain.</p> <p>All of this has meant that Moores has, so far, got away with a pretty modest record. But it's three honeymoons and you're out in this game and, as Lawrence Booth pointed out in <a href=\"http://sport.theguardian.com/thespin/0,,806133,00.html \">The Spin</a>, this might be a career-defining fortnight.</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p><strong>Team news</strong> There are all manner of changes from the last (serious) ODI, against New Zealand at Lord's in June. Kevin Pietersen drops to the more sensible position of No4. Owais Shah leaps to No3 and Matt Prior gets another chance to show that he has the savvy to open the batting in one-day cricket. (A little clue that would save us all a lot of time: he doesn't.) Samit Patel stays in the team after making his debut against Scotland the other day.</p> <p>South Africa, who are without both Morkel brothers, have a few one-day specialists, the most exciting of which is surely the obscenely gifted Herschelle Gibbs. Watch out, too, for JP Duminy, a young batsman with serious flair.</p> <p>I don't mind the look of this England team: there is real depth in the batting and some big-hitters in the bowling. <a href=\"http://www.thewisdencricketer.com/blog/?p=144\">This</a> would be my team, but it's not much different. And the return of Stephen Harmison gives England the intriguing option of Harmison and Flintoff as first- and second-change, which was devastatingly effective against in Australia in 2005. That said, I think that, with another pitch-hitter in Broad in this side, Harmison will probably take the new ball today. I'd be very tempted to try Flintoff at the start of the innings, but they seem averse to it.</p> <!-- Block 5 --> <p><strong>England</strong> Bell, Prior, Shah, Pietersen, Flintoff, Bopara, Patel, Wright, Broad, Harmison, Anderson.</p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p><strong>Stattage</strong> Of the last 12 completed ODIs at Headingley, going back to 1990, 11 have been won by the team batting second. That said, none were day-nighters, so the significant advantage of batting second (ie bowling at Headingley before midday) isn't there. So, basically the last 59 words you've just read have been a complete waste of your time. Sixty-two words now.</p> <!-- Block 7 --> <p><strong>Is it socially acceptable to link to your own work?</strong> <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/22/the_joy_of_six_england_v_south_1.html\">It is now</a></p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p><strong>Proving just how little that stat meant</strong> Kevin Pietersen has won the toss and England will bat first.</p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p><strong>South Africa</strong> Smith, Gibbs, Kallis, de Villiers, Duminy, Boucher, Philander, Botha, Nel, Steyn, Ntini.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p><strong>Riffwatch</strong> Given the <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/organgrinder/2008/08/bbc_radio_4s_test_match_specia_1.html\"> spectacular mid-life crisis that Test Match Special is currently undergoing</a>, why not nominate your alternative yoof/laddish/2k9 presenters for next year's Ashes. Lee Calvert has suggested Dick &amp; Dom In Da TMS Box, which is a good start. </p> <p>Fearne Cotton and Holly Willoughby would give good ball-by-ball, I reckon, and they could kill two birds (it's not sexist \u2013 I'm not calling them birds) with one stone by popping into the crowd to do some matchmaking.</p> <p>Failing that, I reckon those peerless nuggets Bex and Luke from Big Brother should get a go. Their sub-Carry On innuendo (which is quite an achievement, when you think about it) would be something to behold: \"He's wielding his stick Bex; there's a man wielding his stick in public!\" At which point she would steam onto the field with her top whipped up, inducing a collective coronary among the members.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p><strong>\"Robster</strong>,\" begins Jeremy Theobald. \"Would you mind wishing Lynn Bashforth a happy birthday on the OBO today? I won't mention her age but we do seem to be in the pensioners/disabled area at Headingley this afternoon.\" Isn't that more to do with you than her, old boy?</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p><strong>1st over: England 7-0 (Bell 3, Prior 4)</strong> Okay. It's the fit-again Dale Steyn to open the bowling in encouragingly clammy conditions. He gets some early shape, but Bell leans across and works him classily through midwicket for three. This is surely the best position for Bell in this side. Prior then very nearly goes first ball: he was squared up by a good delivery and edged it <em>right between</em> first and second slip, who were both sat scratching their backsides and looking pleased with themselves. It was closer to Kallis at second slip, but he just watched it go to the boundary.</p> <p>\"A new motorway has opened up recently - that's it\" honks Mikey Holding. \"Seven-nil yeah?\" asks Scott Murray as he walks past, showing the instinctive understanding of the game so evident in his OBOs back in the day.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p><strong>2nd over: England 12-0 (Bell 4, Prior 8)</strong> Makhaya Ntini, who as David Lloyd points out has gone for over 60 in his last three ODIs, tempts Bell into fresh-airing a windy woof well wide of off stump from his first delivery. Later in the over Prior laces a quite superb cover-drive for four.</p> <p>This is such a big series for Prior, who in 21-odd ODIs opening has made only one fifty, and has shown an adolescent level of shot-selection. I'd go for Mustard but, having picked Prior, I hope they give him at least this series and the winter's ODIs to adapt to the role at international level. If he's still failing then, fine, have him shot and bring Mustard in.</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p><strong>3rd over: England 17-0 (Bell 5, Prior 10)</strong> Steyn gets too much swing as is wided twice as a result. Prior then screws a slightly leaden-footed drive behind point for two. Early impressions are that it's a pretty decent pitch. </p> <p>\"Afternoon Rob,\" afternoons Andy Bradshaw. \"May I suggest a bet on how long Naylor takes to get an email in with the words \"Prior\" \"Balance\" \"Lack of\" \"for\" \"top\" \"level\" \"cricketer\". I'm going for three overs.\" As ever, Naylor wins.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p><strong>4th over: England 24-0 (Bell 11, Prior 10)</strong> Bell pulls Ntini for two off the front foot; as Holding points out, it reflects the lack of pace in this pitch. Then he rolls his wrists to get three more through square leg. There is talk of Bell being the man to bat through the overs for 115 not out, but that's a bit early-90s, no? Besides, Bell is better than that.</p> <p>\"Charlie Brooker would be brilliant for TMS,\" says Tom Paternoster, \"but only if he was commentating on the commentators during the drinks break. He could tear Boycott a new one every time he brought out his stick of rhubarb. Unfortunately, Charlie's got a face like [\"eulogy\" deleted] so, despite it being radio, they'll probably go for George Lamb and his gang of sycophantic morons.\" I'm sure George Lamb is a good fellow. I'm sure he loves his Ma, furnishes the odd beggar with silver and that. And I do like his beard. But my god if ever there was a living case for a mute button.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p><strong>5th over: England 27-0 (Bell 11, Prior 14)</strong> Steyn is drawn towards the pads, looking for some killer late swing, but it doesn't work and Prior tucks it crisply behind square for four. Good shot. The next shot is an utter disgrace. He tried to pull an 88mph half-tracker, but it was on him too quickly, even on this pitch, and he choked it gently back over the bowler's head and safe. Utter filth, mind.</p> <p>In other news, here's the latest of Dileep Premachandran's <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/22/badrinath_can_cure_middleorder.html\">excellent blogs</a> on the state of Indian cricket.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p><strong>6th over: England 29-0 (Bell 12, Prior 14)</strong> It's all pretty agreeable from England so far, with nothing to moan about: that's no way to spend an OBO. Prior has played some nice strokes, especially that searing cover-drive, and Bell is snugly inside his bubble. It's not quite in the realms of man-love, but I so, so want Ian Bell to succeed. </p> <p>\"I always thought Brian Blessed was a missed opportunity on TMS,\" saying Andy Bradshaw, \"especially when on the sub continent and the phone lines had gone down.\" The day's first genuine LOL!</p> <!-- Block 18 --> <p><strong>7th over: England 34-0 (Bell 11, Prior 18)</strong> Blistering stuff from Prior, who leans into a wide, swinging delivery from Steyn and howitzes it over cover for four. After going over the boundary, the ball drops into the camera pit and gets a good soaking; as a consequence, it's changed. South Africa will hope the new ball swings from straight and not just from wide of off stump.</p> <p>\"Steve McClaren is a shoo-in as a soon-to-be TMS presenter,\" says Andrew Banks. \"He fills all the requirements \u2013 experience on FiveLive, Little understanding of cricket, well any top-class sport, and he's known to the youth of today.\" You only put \"shoo-in\" because it sounds Dutcsh, didn't shoo?</p> <!-- Block 19 --> <p><strong>8th over: England 37-0 (Bell 14, Prior 18)</strong> Ntini, going even wider on the crease than usual and delivering from around extra-cover, draws Bell into an almost fatal grope. Later in the over England take a stupid single to de Villiers, charging in from backward point, and one of them - either Bell or Prior, of that I'm sure - would have gone with a direct hit. Prior, in fact.</p> <p>\"Rob: I think it would be quite fun to have Hugh Porter and Phil Liggett in tandem (couldn't resist!) in the TMS box, with occasional contributions from Gary Herbert \u2013 who could scream 'The British are coming, the British are coming' every now and then,\" says Clare Davies, who may or may not have existed on a diet of nothing but cycling and Pro Plus-Plus for the last fortnight.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p><strong>9th over: England 42-0 (Bell 16 from 34 balls, Prior 22 from 20)</strong> Prior picks Steyn's slower ball and drives it very pleasantly down the ground for three. Then Bell pulls a short one <em>just</em> short of midwicket. England are being done for pace on the bouncer, which is strange as this is a pretty slow pitch. That said, he is, as Shaun Pollock points out, bowing down the hill.</p> <p>\"Alright Rob,\" says Tom Nicolson. Alright Tom Nicolson. \"What's the deal with Luke Wright batting so far down the order having been opener in recent matches?\" Well, the deal with Luke Wright batting so far down the order having been opener in recent matches is, basically, that they want him in the middle for either the first 10 overs or the last 10 overs. If England lose their fifth wicket in, say, the 46th wicket I think they'd promote Wright ahead of Patel.</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p><strong>10th over: England 44-0 (Bell 18, Prior 22)</strong> This is just a bit too slow from Bell: 18 from 40 deliveries now. I really am not sold on this anchor role. Basically, with the exception of things that can't be copied, England should look to be Australia-lite: play the same way but just around 4% as well. And Australia don't have anchormen. They have punishers or strokeplayers (or both) all the way down the order, and with eight/nine batsmen in a team, surely that has to be the way forward. And it's not as if Bell can't do it, either. All things being equal, he should be looking for a strike-rate of around 80. So far, it's below 50.</p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p><strong>11th over: England 46-0 (Bell 19, Prior 23)</strong> Nel replaces Steyn, who bowled okay but couldn't get it to swing when he wanted it to swing, and Philander drops an unbelievable sitter. Prior clunked a drive straight to mid-off, with one hand coming off the bat, and Philander grassed the most straightforward catch imaginable. Nel has steam emerging from every orifice. </p> <p>\"Are you watching the game on Sky or are you at the game; or both?\" asks Dan Woodhouse. None of the above. I'm sat in my jim-jams at home watching Diagnosis Murder. This is just one of those avant-garde \"imaginings\" of how the game might have gone. In reality, in Yorkshire, England are 12 for nine, all nine to Quinton Fortune.</p> <!-- Block 23 --> <p><strong>12th over: England 48-0 (Bell 20, Prior 24)</strong> Ntini gets one to lift savagely from a length past the outside edge of Bell, who recoils like a man who's just had some used grundies waved under his sniffer. England are in a bit of a rut now, possibly scared of the mistake they usually make when they open: getting out in the 20s and 30s.</p> <p>\"I'd suggest Daniel Radcliffe takes over at TMS,\" says Neill Brown. \"He's a cricket fan, so he'd know what he's talking about, plus there'd be endless opportunities for him to make \"witty\" plays on his Harry Potter past with his co-commentators. The kids would love him. And also, let's face it, after the Potter series ends he'll need the work.\"</p> <!-- Block 24 --> <p><strong>13th over: England 51-0 (Bell 22, Prior 25)</strong> \"You can just tell right now that Prior doesn't fully understand his role,\" says Nasser, and he's bang on. Bell, meanwhile, rolls a couple off the pads to bring up a curate's egg of a fifty partnership.</p> <p>In other news, isn't Shaun Pollock a brilliant commentator? And, while we're at it, <em>isn't Schindler's List a brilliant film</em>?</p> <p>\"Riffing on members of an imaginary TMS Box is unlikely to match the eccentricities of Hoggy in real one right now,\" says Gary Naylor. \"I'd like to nominate the great Kenneth Williams for TMS. Given Kenny's notorious spikiness vis a vis Nicholas Parsons on Just a Minute, pairing him with Sir Geoffrey would do it for me.\"</p> <!-- Block 25 --> <p><strong>14th over: England 56-0 (Bell 23, Prior 28)</strong> I'll be honest: Bell is starting to seriously get on my wick now. He's hit 23 from 52, without a boundary. He is so much better than this. It is also putting extra pressure on Prior, who makes room and slams Prior on the bounce to cover, and then works one to leg for two.</p> <p>Pollock and Nasser make a great commentary pair, because both are naturally inquisitive nerds. At the moment they're talking about the difference in opening the bowling against England in one-day cricket with and without Trescothick. I'd transcribe but, y'know.</p> <p>\"Surely TMS is screaming for Marcus Bentley, the voice of Big Brother?\" says Lee Calvert, and I'm glad he added that last bit because I was about to point out that it's <em>Da</em>Marcus, and Beasley rather than Bentley. \"'Ovah thorty-eayet, and the team mayats are talking aboot coming arownd the wicket. Team Captain Pietersen has left the field to go to the diary room, while Ian and Alastair are arguing ovah who is the best at short square-leg'.\" Sold. In fact, it might be the <em>best idea that anyone has ever come up with ever</em>.</p> <!-- Block 26 --> <p><strong>15th over: England 59-0 (Bell 24, Prior 29)</strong> Nel has an en<em>or</em>mous shout for LBW - seriously, it went on for about 10 seconds before the pain of rejection silenced him - against Bell. Bell had come miles across his stumps and was hit on the pad on off stump; Hawkeye had it clipping the top of off and middle. Later in the over yet another pull/hook is mistimed, with Prior bottom-edging it into his breadbasket. It's another good over for South Africa - only four boundaries in the first 15 overs now, and one of those fortuitous -and the walls are starting to close in. </p> <p>\"Surely we should start a 'Gary Naylor for TMS' campaign?\" save Dave Bell. \"This would have 2 advantages; 1) it would give mere mortals such as myself more chance of achieving fame by having an OBO missive printed, and 2) He baffles me a lot of the time, so he would have at least some chance of doing that to Boycott and keeping him quiet for a while. Everyone's a winner.\" Boycott and Naylor deserve a much greater stage than TMS. Prime Minister's Questions? Nuts TV?</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>16th over: England 62-0 (Bell 27, Prior 29)</strong> So we're into the final Powerplay, but England haven't scored a boundary since 1983, and there are none in that over, with Bell's tribute to Sunny Gavaskar's 1975 go-slow continuing. Sometimes this approach is justified - Mike Atherton took 29 balls to get off the work on a juicy Lord's track in the decisive ODI v West Indies in 1995, and he judged it beautifully, eventually getting a stunning century - but there's nothing in the pitch to suggest that this is such a situation.</p> <p>\"Noel Edmonds,\" offers Tom Oxley, mistaking this riff for 'Room 101 only they actually get clipped rather than shoved in an imaginary hole'. \"He's a creative genius, carries a wry and gentlemanly humour and has a beard. Furthermore Deal or No Deal is the best programme ever. Fact.\"</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>17th over: England 65-0 (Bell 30, Prior 29)</strong> I don't always look forward to Beefy entering the box, but he could be on fire in view of today's events. Already he's off on one: \"plodding along\"; \"no idea how to use Powerplays\". Beefy is in the box with Nick Knight. Now that's a one-day opening partnership that would have been interesting. Three from that over, and it's drinks. Bell has 30 from 63 balls, Prior 29 from 39.</p> <p>\"Re: Tom Nicolson,\" begins George Thomson. \"What's the deal with Luke Wright being anywhere international cricket? Other than a marketable hairdo.\"</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>18th over: England 71-0 (Bell 34, Prior 31)</strong> Even when Bell gets a wide length delivery from the new bowler Kallis, he can only crash it straight to the man at short-extra. Beefy is ranting about Bell's strike-rate - \"not good enough for me\" - and, well, he's right. <em>England haven't hit a boundary for 11 Powerplay overs</em>.</p> <p>In other news, Ed Collington is a man after my own heart. \"TMS could do worse than <a href=\"http://www.struttergear.com/\">Mike Strutter</a>,\" he says. \"It'd be worth tuning in to hear him calling Prior a clumsy Mmtherf*&amp;^er everytime he put one down.\" I don't really think he'd use the word 'clumsy' now, do you?</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>19th over: England 75-0 (Bell 34, Prior 35)</strong> THE FIRST BOUNDARY FOR 70 BALLS! Inevitably it didn't come from Bell; instead Prior charged Nel and heaved him high over mid-on. He didn't really get hold of it, and it dribbled apologetically to the fence, but they all count yeah? Those are the only runs from the over.</p> <p>\"What about 15 Peter 20?\" says Alex Netherton. \"He'd certainly introduce a golden new dynamic to commentary. Effluently similar to Pougatch.\" I actually don't mind Pougatch. And if anyone disses Vic Marks they're barred from this here OBO. Vic's soothing voice could quell a riot in Oz by the third syllable <em>at the latest</em>.</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>THE CLOWN WALKS. WICKET: ENGLAND 77-1 (Bell c de Villiers b Kallis 35)</strong> The inevitable punchline to all that miserable faffing arrives when Bell, coming down the track to Kallis, slices a slower ball to backward point, where de Villiers takes a showy but still excellent two-handed catch above his head.</p> <p>That really is utter garbage from Bell: 35 from 69 boundaryless deliveries, taking up all bar three balls of the Powerplay overs. Once you promise as a one-day opener, you simply have to pay.</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>20th over: England 78-1 (Prior 36, Shah 1)</strong> Shah, in his newish role at No3 (he batted there in a couple of ODIs back in the day, possibly in India in 2005-06), gets off the mark with a single. And that's the end of Powerplays, from which England accrued a risible five boundaries.</p> <p>\"Perhaps a Peep Show TMS special would be a runner,\" says Ian Copestake. \"One couldn't imagine Jez being at all interested though unless Super Hans offered him some speed to get him through it.\" Gog could be the Alison Mitchell-style pitchside rover, going round demanding that people go and get him a kebab.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>21st over: England 79-1 (Prior 36, Shah 1)</strong> Beefy and Knight are having a right-old tear-up in the commentary box. This is great stuff. Beefy is putting the boot in on Bell for getting one fifty in 21 innings; Knight is defending him, saying he's a class act and it's about defining roles. Shah, who I prefer at No6 to No3 for what it's worth, plays himself in against Nel in that over. Clare Davies, meanwhile, calls for Usain Bolt to be shoehorned into the team.</p> <p>\"It seems England can't win,\" says Martyn Kingsbury, who's got that straight. \"They have successfully played through the first 18 overs without losing a single wicket and still go at nigh on 4 an over and they still get ripped apart...\" Four an over stopped being acceptable 15 years ago. What would Australia be here? Say 130 for two maybe? And it's not like it's beyond Bell to play aggressively and pierce the field: he very frequently gets to a run-a-ball 30 in Test cricket before knuckling down.</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 86-2 (Prior c de Villiers b Kallis 42)</strong> Gah! Matt Prior falls within sight of a fifty yet again. He had smoked Kallis majestically over long-on the previous ball, but the blood rushed to his head and he crashed the next ball straight to de Villiers at backward point. Still, 42 from 52 is a decent return to the side, especially as his opening partner was R Mortis.</p> <p>Just a thought, while we're here: how the hell does Kallis pick up so many wickets?</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>22nd over: England 87-2 (Shah 2, Pietersen 1)</strong> The new batsman is Pietersen, who in his previous three one-day innings has failed to reach double figures.</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>23rd over: England 92-2 (Shah 4, Pietersen 4)</strong> The new bowler is Johan Botha, an off-spinner about whom I know little. This is why it's so important to have Pietersen no higher than No4 (and ideally at No5): he must be around in the middle overs to milk and manhandle these average spinners.</p> <p>It's a decent move by South Africa, too, because they will feel they can get away with two or three of Botha's overs while Pietersen plays himself in. Shah flap-sweeps a poor delivery to fine leg for two. Five from the over.</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>24th over: England 96-2 (Shah 6, Pietersen 6)</strong> Not much happens in that Kallis over; Shah improvises nicely to take a single to third man.</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>25th over: England 99-2 (Shah 8, Pietersen 7)</strong> Botha gets rid of another over for just three runs. England are struggling a wee bit here. </p> <p><a href=\"http://stats.cricinfo.com/statsguru/engine/stats/index.html?class=2;filter=advanced;orderby=balls_faced;qualmax1=0;qualmax2=0;qualmin1=0;qualmin2=0;qualval1=fours;qualval2=sixes;template=results;type=batting;view=innings\">Here</a>, by the way, is a list of the longest ODI innings without a boundary. I knew Kim Barnett was good at something apart from being bald.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>26th over: England 103-2 (Shah 9, Pietersen 10)</strong> Pietersen, on the walk to his nemesis Kallis, inside-edges a fraction short of Boucher, diving away to his left.</p> <p>Sam Collins is here. \"Prior's technique was so shoddy today. Can't keep his hand on the bat because his weight is all wrong. When are England going to learn how to bat in the first ten overs? It's not rocket science; bowlers hate bowling at batsmen who come at them, as Pollock said earlier. It's the continual lack of intent that is so galling.\"</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>27th over: England 106-2 (Shah 9, Pietersen 13)</strong> Whatever happened to the Pietersen slog-sweep? That's three overs out the way from Botha now, for only 11 runs, and I reckon it's time for these two, both devastating punishers of spin when they want to be, to go after him. There are risks involved, but of course there are bloody risks involved: this is one-day cricket.</p> <p>Here's a good email from Naylor. \"If we apply Mssrs Duckworth and Lewis' reasoning, ODI cricket is all about resources used and resources available. A huge advantage of having proper batsmen at 8 and 9 is that the batting resources are \"extended\" in terms of talent, but (obviously) not in terms of overs. This is why Australia keep attacking four even five down, knowing there's batting to come. England's slowness risks leaving batting resources unused (through batsmen left in the pavilion or proper batsmen arriving at the crease to slog immediately). This is the 21st century version of being bowled out with overs left.\" What he said. The last line is particularly true. At the start of this game the idea of a one-day anchorman mildly irritated me; now it's making me want to cleave everything that moves with the nearest golf club. It's so ridiculously antiquated.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>28th over: England 113-2 (Shah 12, Pietersen 16)</strong> Vernon Philander is the new bowler. They've just shown a replay of Nel when Philander dropped that sitter off his bowling earlier in the day. I think I may just have felt the first pangs of the man-love for Nel. Back in the real world, Shah tries to smear Philander from wide of off stump but only crunches it onto his pad and away for one. England have still hit only six boundaries all innings.</p> <p>\"Blimey!\" says Ken Nettleship, possibly upon realising that his surname is actually 'Nettleship'. \"Kim Barnett must have been knackered after that knock though. Mark Dekker, Zim, looked impressive with 22 scored off 18 overs worth of bowling, he must have been calling 'no' as the bowler was still in his run up.\"</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 113-3 (Shah c Philander b Botha 12)</strong> Oh christ. Shah does finally go at Botha, but only skies a sweep high to deep backward square, where the butterfingered Philander makes an entirely straightforward catch look like something out of the Krypton Factor, eventually taking it at the second attempt after it went through his hands and hit him in the chest.</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>29th over: England 115-3 (Pietersen 17, Flintoff 1)</strong> The oldest member of the team, Freddie Flintoff, is the new batsman. He's done his best work in ODIs at No5, most notably in 2004, but don't expect fireworks straight away: he likes a good 15-20 balls to play himself in.</p> <p>\"That list of innings without boundaries is palpably false,\" says Gary Naylor. \"David Boon is listed as making 64 off 98 balls running them all! He'd have expired.\"</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>30th over: England 117-3 (Pietersen 18, Flintoff 2)</strong> Two from Philander's over, in which Flintoff is beaten by a lolloping slower ball that bounced twice on its way through to Boucher. In England's defence, this is a slowish pitch, but nonetheless it is criminal to have only scored six boundaries in 30 overs. Realistically they need at least 220 to have anything resembling a chance, but par is probably somewhere nearer 262.44.</p> <p>\"If England are going to insist on a one-day anchorman can it be Ron Burgundy?\" says Melanie Brown. \"At least that would be funny, rather than laughable.\" Best not to suggest alternative biffers, eh?</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>31st over: England 123-3 (Pietersen 22, Flintoff 4)</strong> In Throw Momma From The Train, during the writing class, one of the characters offers his opus: \"100 women I'd like to...\". I have an alternative idea: \"100 utterly mediocre spinners who have ... England during the middle overs of an ODI.\" Bestseller waiting to happen - fact, yeah? Botha has just joined the list that includes such luminaries as Mark Dekker, Sanath Jayasuriya, Aravinda de Silva, Daan van Bunge, Shoaib Mohammad, Chris Gayle, Dirk Viljoen (!) and other family favourites. Any publishers who are interested, feel free to contact my agent.</p> <p>I don't have an agent. Anyway, Botha should have had another wicket in that over. Pietersen went miles across to sweep, missed it, and was hit plumb in front basically. But so far across did he go that the umpire must have thought he got outside the line.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>32nd over: England 126-3 (Pietersen 23, Flintoff 6)</strong> And still England accumulate. And still Matt Prior is the only man to have hit a boundary.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>33rd over: England 130-3 (Pietersen 26, Flintoff 7)</strong><br>Pietersen gets away with a brutally tight referral to the third umpire. He took a really tight two to fine leg, and had to dive to make his ground. But in doing so, his bat bounced up, and basically it was impossible to be absolutely certain that the bat had bounced up at the moment the wicket was broken - it seemed to do so just after. Had Boucher been a split-second slower, Pietersen would have been out. On such decisions are the extent of English defeats decided: it might only be with 10 overs to spare now.</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>34th over: England 134-3 (Pietersen 28, Flintoff 8)</strong> The fantasy scenario is approaching - Pietersen and Flintoff, at the crease and in for the last 15 overs - but at the moment mundane reality prevails: just four from that Philander over. If I ever go on Room 101, the middle overs of an ODI involving England are going in first. Maybe second after George Lamb. Maybe third after George Lamb and, just in case the dog eats the first one, George Lamb. But they're going in.</p> <p>\"Re: over 31,\" begins Steve Betteley. \"My suggestions are Robert Croft, Neil Smith, Peter Such, Richard Daws.....I'm missing the point aren't I?\" It'd make for a cracking companion book.</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>35th over: England 141-3 (Pietersen 30, Flintoff 13)</strong> Smart move from Smith, who brings back Dale Steyn with a view to taking the wicket that would stall England's charge before it even starts. For now it works in England's favour: the extra pace enables Flintoff to crunch one through the covers for four - the first boundary scored by someone other than Matt Prior in this game. Seven from the over.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>36th over: England 152-3 (Pietersen 32, Flintoff 22)</strong> Ntini (8-0-27-0) returns. As Nasser points out, Smith brought back his opening bowlers straight after the mandatory bowling change. The hard ball works both ways, and Flintoff lifts him high over the leg side, but after bouncing a few feet inside the rope it almost stops completely, so England only get two. Next ball he backs away and clubs it with a cross bat through extra cover for four. Top shot, and 11 from the over. Not unsurprisingly, it's the most profitable of the innings.</p> <p>\"Surely Swiss Toni for TMS,\" says Peter Joyner. \"'Playing cricket is very much like making love to a beautiful woman. Grab hold of the old bat, polish your balls and you've bowled a maiden over...'. Or something like that only much funnier.\"</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>37th over: England 158-3 (Pietersen 33, Flintoff 27)</strong> Pietersen is playing like Bevan at the moment - 33 from 46 balls with no fours - but that's okay while Flintoff is playing like Flintoff. He takes five the four deliveries he faces in that Steyn over and England, despite themselves, have a base to at least reach a workable total of 250.</p> <p>Anyone not in the pub?</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>38th over: England 160-3 (Pietersen 34, Flintoff 28)</strong> Philander is back on for Ntini. That's interesting, because he doesn't need to bowl (the fifth-bowler combination of Botha and Philander have already bowled 10 overs). Philander has at least three different slower balls, a couple of which keep Flintoff honest early in the over. The speeds for the first three balls were 81, 71 and 63mph. It's a really good over, in fact: just two from it. The crowd couldn't care less: they're all rendered on pints of Liver Compromiser and the Mexican wave has started.</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>39th over: England 170-3 (Pietersen 41, Flintoff 31)</strong> Botha (6-0-23-1) also returns, which to my mind is an unnecessary risk because Pietersen could mangle him. But Botha's line (middle stump) and length (full) are really good to Pietersen, allowing him to take only three from the first three balls, the third of which brings up the fifty partnership from 62 balls. If they reach the hundred, it's fair to presume the second fifty won't take anywhere near as long.</p> <p>Later in the over Botha offers Pietersen a full toss, which he smears inevitably over midwicket for his first boundary of the innings. A dismal end to an otherwise good over: 10 from it.</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>40th over: England 181-3 (Pietersen 46, Flintoff 36)</strong> Philander's first ball is a no-ball because there were only three men in the circle (Kallis at short fine leg should have been down at fine leg). It's the start of a profitable over for England: 11 from it. First Pietersen smears one gunbarrel-straight for four and then Flintoff, waiting for the slower ball, dumps it contemptuously over Philander's head for a one-bounce four.</p> <p>\"My brother has just sent me a text claiming he has had a message on the Guardian OBO for three matches in a row,\" says Chris Betteley. \"Apparently that's a good thing for him. Now I don't know the first thing about cricket and didn't realise there was a game on, but at the end of the text he just sent me it said 'in your face' like he's got one up on me. Can you please put this message on your OBO thing so I can shut him up.\" I bet the Betteley Christmas lunch is a cracker.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>41st over: England 194-3 (Pietersen 57, Flintoff 38)</strong> Nel is back but England are flying now: 13 more from that over. Pietersen belabours the first ball through the covers off the back foot to bring up his fifty from 55 balls, a very fine effort given that he's only scored three boundaries. </p> <p>From the next ball, he plays an astonishing shot. He walks miles across his stumps to sweep a length delivery - from Andre Nel, lest we forget - well outside off stump behind square for a spine-tingling boundary. Genius, right there.</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>42nd over: England 200-3 (Pietersen 58, Flintoff 42)</strong> Pietersen survives a big shout for LBW after being pinned by a slower off-cutter from Philander. It looked like there was enough doubt over height to justify Simon Taufel's decision even though Hawkeye had it clipping the top of middle. Six from the over.</p> <p>\"'And England, despite themselves, have a base to at least reach a workable total of 250,'\" quotes Tim Parkinson. \"Come on, Rob; this is tabloid and deeply uncharitable. Looks like England might actually be pacing it well, no?\" Sorry, but that's garbage. They are three wickets down with eight overs to go, which means Bell had no excuse for batting the way he did. <em>Pietersen and Flintoff</em> have paced it excellently, but not Bell.</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>43rd over: England 208-3 (Pietersen 60, Flintoff 48)</strong> Lovely shot from Flintoff, who makes room to lift a slower short ball over point for four. That makes it eight from the over.</p> <p>\"Come on then Smyth, and we both know you have a theory, so I'm asking the question: why do you think we've never had this Pietersen-Flintoff dream sequence?\" says RB McKinley. \"I know injury, but I mean, why has it never worked at the crease before?\" Everyone asks this, which means everyone has forgotten Edgbaston 05, the fools. I suppose in the past there might have been machismo issues - both are much humbler players these days - but I think it's more that they were in the wrong position in the order: Pietersen at No4, for example, is frequently in by the 10th over so unlikely to be around by the final 10. I'm all for a flexible order from Nos 3-8, the chief purpose of which (apart from scoring runs) is to get Pietersen in around the 20th over and Flintoff around the 32nd.</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>44th over: England 211-3 (Pietersen 62, Flintoff 49)</strong> Philander is mixing his pace very well under pressure - while it seems obvious, it takes stones to bowl a 55mph off-cutter to Pietersen or Flintoff - and England get just three singles. Superb bowling.</p> <p>\"I think I'm the only person not in the pub!\" says Beth Connor. \"But does mean I can read the OBO without fear of discovery. Though to be fair I think my boss has been turning a blind eye to my sports monitoring antics. I know my chief exec knows; he keeps asking me for the score!\" What slovenly, two-bit shower would permit this level of skiving, you wonder? Yep, she's a civil servant.</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>45th over: England 218-3 (Pietersen 64, Flintoff 54)</strong> Pietersen, miles short, would have been run out there by a direct hit from the bowler Nel, sprawling on the floor and throwing in one movement with his tongue flapping around like a lizard's. He missed.</p> <p>From the next ball, Flintoff tucks an attempted yorker off his pads for four to reach a really excellent fifty from 52 balls - his first for England since the CB Series of 2006-07. He looks in good nick, and he looks like he's enjoying it. I'm not sure which is the chicken and which is the egg, but it's refreshing to see the old Flintoff make an appearance. Seven from the over.</p> <p>\"Brian Sewell for TMS,\" says Alan White. \"'Thit's a wonderful, rustic shawt from Flintorf, one that recalls some of Gainsborough's more rustic landscapes..'.\"</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>46th over: England 232-3 (Pietersen 75, Flintoff 55)</strong> Steyn replaces Philander (8-0-37-0), yeah, and England take 14 from the over, yeah? Four of them are mowed thrillingly over wide mid-on by Pietersen, who then lifts the next ball all the way over long-on. Wonderful shot.</p> <p>\"Beth Connor can't possibly be a civil servant,\" says Zadok Prescott. \"It's past 5:30 and she's still at work.\" The wonder of flexitime, eh?</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>47th over: England 243-3 (Pietersen 76, Flintoff 66)</strong> Eleven from Nel's over. It begins when Flintoff works one to fine leg for four from miles outside off stump. Then from the fifth ball he does it again: same shot, albeit a fraction squarer, and the same result. Splendid stuff.</p> <p>\"Oh it's worse then that,\" begins Beth Connor. \"I'm a contractor working for the Civil Service. Otherwise I'd have slopped off to the pub at 4:10pm like everyone else. But to be fair you get paid to watch sports for a living!\"</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>48th over: England 257-3 (Pietersen 77, Flintoff 75)</strong> Flintoff strong-arms Steyn through the covers and, with the aid of some brainless fielding from Ntini on the cover boundary, gets four for it. He then gets four more with a wonderful shot. He was zig-zagging around his crease, so Steyn gave him one full and outside off stump. Flintoff just rifled it back whence it came for four. The next ball brings four more, albeit absurdly: Flintoff missed a full toss, which missed leg stump by a whisker and scuttled past Boucher. Fourteen from the over.</p> <p>\"It's but one Test and half an ODI into his tenure, but KP is looking an inspired choice for skipper,\" says Gary Naylor. \"I feel it's important to say this, because had KP been failing, the naysayers would be screaming.\" Just wait till he gets out switch-hitting. One obvious thing is that everyone appears to be enjoying themselves a lot more - Harmison even smiled during the Oval Test - but let's see how much fun they're having in the first Test in India when the home side are 452 for five in reply to England's 277 and Dhoni is whirling it everywhere. That was when the 03-05 Vaughan really came into his own.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>49th over: England 270-3 (Pietersen 87, Flintoff 78)</strong> Philander gets the penultimate over, and England take 13 from it. It shouldn't have been that many, but AB de Villiers of all people turns two into four with a shambolic misfield running round from long-on (I think). Pietersen salts the wound by lashing the next one through long-on for four.</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>WICKET! England 271-4 (Flintoff b Steyn 78)</strong> Flintoff's policy of walking across his stumps eventually brings about his downfall: he misses, Steyn hits. Simple. But so was Flintoff's batting: as cheerily uncomplicated as it was back in the day, and bringing him a splendid 78 from 70 balls in a partnership of 158 in 21 overs with his captain.</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>50th over: England 275-4 (Pietersen 90, Wright 2)</strong> So only five from a very good last over from Steyn, and South Africa will need 276 to win: just about par I'd say.</p> <p>It really was an innings of two halves. Rigor Mortis, hiding under an Ian Bell mask, meant that England took only 99 from the first 25 overs; from the second 25 they took 176, most of them during a superb fourth-wicket partnership of 158 between Pietersen, who ends on 90 not out, and Flintoff. The captaincy isn't doing much harm to KP's batting at the moment, is it?</p> <p>I'm off to put something wet in my mouth. See you in 30 minutes for what should be a cracking run-chase.</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>Mid-innings waffle</strong> \"Pouring a large glass of Devil's Advocaat, as I'm STILL not in the pub...couldn't you say that Freddie and KP are at their most vulnerable if they come in early and have to nurdle?\" says Alan White. \"In some ways Belly getting through the first 20 odd overs is helpful, even if he didn't exactly pile on the runs.\" I take the point, but I disagree: with a flexible order Bell can go at it from the off and, in real terms, you could have had five more overs of a punisher (Wright, Patel, whoever) plus all this from Flintoff and Pietersen. But the key lesson from this innings is that the timing of the arrival of Flintoff and Pietersen is absolutely crucial, and the only way to control that is to have a flexible batting order.</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>Hello again</strong> \"What's remarkable about that list of the longest ODI innings without a boundary,\" begins Thom Scott-Phillips, \"is that if you reorder it by strike rate you find out that Ian Bishop once scored 14 off 3 balls (SR 466.66), <em>without scoring a boundary</em>.\" Ten overthrows and two twos? It's clearly a cock-up: he added 51 with Keith Arthurton, so if Bishop's share was 14, and from three balls, there would have been all sorts of tomfoolery going on.</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>1st over: South Africa 5-0 (chasing 276; Gibbs 2, Smith 1)</strong> Now this is interesting: England have given the new ball to Broad rather than Harmison. I like this move, partly because I really like Harmison at first change, and partly because Broad has earned the right with some very good one-day performances so far. It can be the making of a man, you know.</p> <p>His second ball is a wide, to Gibbs, but his third zips away from Smith's grope and the fourth takes a thick edge low to third man. It's a decent enough first over: five from it.</p> <p>Anyone out there?</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>2nd over: South Africa 10-0 (chasing 276; Gibbs 6, Smith 2)</strong> It's Anderson at the other end, as expected. Encouragingly, his first two balls to Smith swing different ways, first in and then out, but it's early swing and as such less dangerous. Later in the over he drifts one onto Gibbs's pads and is kissed to fine leg for four. </p> <p>\"England need to take a few early wickets and get Kallis in... and keep him in,\" says Gary Naylor. Kallis, like Bell, is an annoying one-day player because he hides his light under a bushel. I remember a game in the last World Cup against the West Indies when, possibly piqued by being accused of selfishness by the Aussies, he played some absolutely devastating shots.</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>3rd over: South Africa 15-0 (chasing 276; Gibbs 6, Smith 7)</strong> Pietersen at mid-off turns four into one with a good piece of fielding but then that one into two with an unnecessary and errant throw. So overall he saved two. It's been a pretty low-key start, but South Africa will be content to be going at five an over without even acknowledging the long handle, never mind engaging it.</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>4th over: South Africa 21-0 (chasing 276; Gibbs 6, Smith 12)</strong> Smith drives Anderson for four, and then Gibbs touch Anderson just short of the man deliberately placed at short midwicket. Bah, gah and wah all at once. </p> <p>\"I'm not in the pub,\" says Phil Sawyer with what sounds like pride, but arguably shouldn't be. \"I'm at home having a cold Corona Extra and catching up on what I've missed having just got back from sorting out a loan prior to picking up my new planet unfriendly Civic Type R tomorrow. The mid-life crisis starts here. And the volley of abuse from green OBOers...\" Sadly that assumes that anyone is actually reading this.</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>5th over: South Africa 25-0 (chasing 276; Gibbs 7, Smith 15)</strong> Gibbs takes a bum-squeaking single to mid-on, but Wright fumbles it. Later in the over he turns four into two with a brilliant piece of work, chasing the ball down as might a mangy mutt and catching up with it a few paces inside the rope. </p> <p>\"So you'll probably be there till what, 10:30/11? <em>To the tune of that music they play when a six is hit</em> Ha ha de ha ha haha de ha ha ha ha de ha ha ha ha de ha ha ha ha de ha ha ha ha de ha ha de ha ha ha ha de ha ha,\" goads Sam Collins, who will do well to ha de ha when he's got my foot up hi</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>6th over: South Africa 36-0 (chasing 276; Gibbs 11, Smith 15)</strong> It's still pretty muted, but Anderson had a biggish shout for LBW against Gibbs. It looked to be sliding down, and Hawkeye feels the same. Gibbs responds with a delicious and emphatic cover drive from around middle-and-leg. He gets four more next ball, leg-byes when Anderson errs. This has been a poor start from him - there were also three wides in that over - and South Africa are flying without really having had to spread their wings.</p> <p>\"I've been a long time viewer of OBO, MBM and the like, and I've yet to <br>see one that doesn't include the words 'Gary' and 'Naylor',\" says Stu Urch. \"Does anybody at Guardian Towers or any fellow OBOers recall such an occasion!?\" As with mobile phones, Peep Show and Liver Compromiser, I don't really remember life before Gary Naylor.</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>7th over: South Africa 45-0 (chasing 276; Gibbs 18, Smith 17)</strong> Smith, I forgot to say, is ranked No1 in the official ODI batting rankings. But at the moment I'm just enjoying Gibbs. This will surely be the last series in which we'll see him - he's 34 now - and even though he hasn't always delivered (his Test average should be higher than 41.95), when he has done so he has had the hairs on the back of his neck completely at his mercy. To prove the point he has just driven Broad inside-out over wide mid-off for six. Glorious stuff, and England have no option but to call for Harmison and especially Flintoff ahead of schedule.</p> <p>In other news, some floodgates have just opened: South Africa have officially told the ICC that they are pulling out of the Champions Trophy if it is held in Pakistan.</p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 50-1 (Smith c Prior b Harmison 21)</strong> Who writes his scripts? Harmison takes a wicket in his first over back, and it was a good delivery too: a lifting leg-cutter that kissed Smith's edge on its way through to Prior. Harmison is mobbed by his team-mates, who all seemed really delighted, as much for him as because of the context of the game. England really, really needed that.</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>8th over: South Africa 50-1 (chasing 276; Gibbs 18, Kallis 0)</strong> One thing we sometimes forget about Harmison is that he brings out the animal in all of us. A disinterested crowd are suddenly baying for blood, woooooooooohing every ball, and that must impact upon the batsmen as well.</p> <p>\"I'm here, wondering when to crack open my bottle of Saffer Shiraz Rose,\" says Clare Davies. \"Thinking I might save it until my local librarian drops in for a drink, bringing with her, hopefully, Jonathan Wilson's latest opus magnus. So cheers, Rob \u2013 I think I might be losing the plot a bit, but never mind. Semper fideles or is it fidelis? I never can mind.\"</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>9th over: South Africa 60-1 (chasing 276; Gibbs 28, Kallis 0)</strong><br>Mixed over from Broad. Okay, a naff over with one good bit. Either side of beating Gibbs with a gem, he gifts four balls: one touched to leg and the other larruped through the covers off the back foot. Stop: Freddietime.</p> <p>Okay, so apparently that Champions Trophy story this is old news. But more importantly: has anyone heard about the bloody Titanic?!</p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p><strong>10th over: South Africa 65-1 (chasing 276; Gibbs 28, Kallis 5)</strong> Kallis gets off the mark in style, square-driving Harmison to the fence. Despite that wicket, South Africa are still cruising: their run-rate is 6.50 and the required-rate only 5.27.</p> <p>\"I can't believe there is not a 'Gary Naylor for prime minister' group on Facebook yet,\" says Dave Tovey. \"Guess what I'm going to be doing tomorrow?!\" Discreetly watching porn, openly watching Soccer Saturday (postmodern porn) and then drinking pints of Knee-Weakener in the evening? Oh.</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>11th over: South Africa 71-1 (chasing 276; Gibbs 33, Kallis 6)</strong> Old Man Flintoff is on for Broad (5-0-33-0), but Gibbs couldn't care about that. He just swaggers away and down the pitch, like the Fonz entering a room, and slams a length ball over mid-off for four. That was a shot of the purest talent, because it was a heavy, 89mph ball.</p> <p>England, by the way, were 46 for none after 11 overs. \"Rob,\" says Paul Spencer. \"Tell Clare Davies to open her plonk now. Otherwise, she might have to share it.\"</p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>12th over: South Africa 73-1 (chasing 276; Gibbs 34, Kallis 7)</strong> Two from Harmison's over. \"Is it just Headingley or is this \"no spinner\" selection a change of policy?\" says Gary Naylor. \"I like slower bowling in ODIs, but if a spinner doesn't warrant his place, I'd be happy with four speedsters and some dibbly-dobbling. Oh, I've missed Samit Patel - something I feel Herschelle won't.\" Suspect it's a Headingley assumption, although they also did it the other day. I'm all for only four specialist bowlers - if two of them are Broad and Flintoff, you get a really long batting line-up - but I'd like to see Swann in the side in all bar the most extreme conditions (which these aren't), especially as we're theoretically building towards a World Cup on the subcontinent.</p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p><strong>13th over: South Africa 85-1 (chasing 276; Gibbs 34, Kallis 19)</strong> Four to Kallis, walking across his stumps to ping Flintoff through square-leg. It's a shot of brilliant, languid authority. He does it again two balls later, to a poor delivery this time, and then slices four more through the vacant slip area. South Africa are already 34 ahead of where England were at this stage. After 13 overs, that's a big difference, and I'm afraid this game is going only one way. That said, if South Africa keep up this rate of clatter, I might make Eviction Night!</p> <p>\"Still here, still reading, desperately wish I wasn't,\" says Richard Sheffle. He wrote a bit after that, but this is pretty much the gist.</p> <!-- Block 82 --> <p><strong>14th over: South Africa 90-1 (chasing 276; Gibbs 34, Kallis 23)</strong> Kallis may have read the entry for the second over, because he's playing beautifully: when Harmison bangs one in, Kallis swivels to sweet-spot it over square-leg for a one-bounce four. <em>This is how you bat in the Powerplays overs</em>.</p> <!-- Block 83 --> <p><strong>15th over: South Africa 91-1 (chasing 276; Gibbs 35, Kallis 23)</strong> A much, much better over from Flintoff, the sort we've seen a million times before. One from it. Meanwhile, Pietersen has had enough and done one, presumably for a toilet break, so Cook is on the field. I wonder who the stand-in captain is. Flintoff? <em>Bell</em>? Bloody hell.</p> <p>\"Any chance of a pic of Gary Naylor?\" says James Cook. \"He's part of the OBO furniture, would be good to see what he looked like...\" I'm got a cob on now: nobody ever asks for a picture of me. Admittedly there are good reasons for this, most of them aesthetic and some of them legal, but still.</p> <!-- Block 84 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 93-2 (Gibbs b Patel 37)</strong></p> <p>In one-day cricket, not taking a Powerplay is pretty much equivalent to waving the white flag. England haven't taken the Powerplay. It's Pietersen's decision - he's back on now - and with the field able to go back he brings on the left-arm spin of Samit Patel. And Patel has struck with his fourth ball! It skidded on and went straight through Gibbs, who had made room to go through or over the off side. Well, well, well. It's an inspired move by Kevin Pietersen, and from hereon in I may keep my opinions on Powerplays to myself.</p> <!-- Block 85 --> <p><strong>16th over: South Africa 93-2 (chasing 276; Kallis 24, de Villiers 0)</strong> One obscenely gifted all-round sportsman replaces another: de Villiers is the new batsman. But that's a great start for Patel, whose figures are 1-0-2-1. It's not his debut - he played and took a wicket against Scotland the other day - but it will feel like it.</p> <!-- Block 86 --> <p><strong>17th over: South Africa 96-2 (chasing 276; Kallis 26, de Villiers 1)</strong> Now Pietersen <em>does</em> take the Powerplay, a decision with which I totally agree. One more wicket and England will feel very confident, because South Africa don't have quite as dangerous a lower-middle order as usual (no Albie Morkel for one). After that we have Duminy, Boucher, Philander, Botha and then the bowlers. Three runs from Flintoff's over, including a peach that squared up and beat Kallis.</p> <!-- Block 87 --> <p><strong>18th over: South Africa 100-2 (chasing 276; Kallis 30, de Villiers 1)</strong> With Patel's work done, Harmison returns to the attack, but his first ball is a touch too short, a touch too wide, and Kallis screams it behind point for four. He tries to do the same later in the over to a ball that was shorter and got bigger, but only succeeds in sending fresh air racing away to the fence. Four from the over.</p> <!-- Block 88 --> <p><strong>19th over: South Africa 100-2 (chasing 276; Kallis 30, de Villiers 1)</strong> Maiden from Flintoff, or \"Flintstone\" as David Gower just called him. \"I was pictured on the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/22/olympics20082\">Olympics MBM</a> earlier today,\" says Gary Naylor. \"I quote Scott Murray at 11.43am, 'Hong Kong Charlie is right about the Modern Pentathlon being based on the skills of a 19th century British soldier - an officer,' writes Naylor (<a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Karl_Marx.jpg\">pictured here</a>). 'If it were based on the life of a squaddie, it would comprise: being shouted at; forcing pay out of reluctant quartermasters; getting by on half-rations; wearing cheap, unsuitable clothing; and not sharing in the proceeds of Empire'.\"</p> <!-- Block 89 --> <p><strong>20th over: South Africa 108-2 (chasing 276; Kallis 33, de Villiers 6)</strong> Beautiful shot from de Villiers, blasting a wide, fullish delivery from Harmison square on the off side for four. Eight from the over, and South Africa are still in a <em>rea</em>sonable amount of control.</p> <p>\"I hope you aren't going to be watching that disgusting Big Brother! One of them can't use the toilet properly! You'll start with your dirty tricks again! Love etc, Mother.\" Says David Weston.</p> <!-- Block 90 --> <p><strong>21st over: South Africa 120-2 (chasing 276; Kallis 35, de Villiers 15)</strong> Kallis is limping fairly badly after taking a sharp single. If anything significant comes of it, you'll hear it here fourth. De Villiers then takes Flintoff for consecutive boundaries, one to third man and one to fine leg. </p> <p>\"Keeping Gary Naylor's identity under wraps would be a far greater homage to him as he would then become the Thomas Pynchon of the OBO,\" says Ian Copestake. \"Perhaps he too could then appear on The Simpsons with a bag over his head, while telling Homer exactly why baseball is not really a sport.\"</p> <!-- Block 91 --> <p><strong>22nd over: South Africa 124-2 (chasing 276; Kallis 38, de Villiers 16)</strong> Now that the Powerplay overs are done, Pietersen goes back to Samit Patel. His left-arm spin looks quite rudimentary - don't play for turn, basically - but South Africa content themselves with having a look at his bowling for now: four from the over.</p> <p>It has started raining at Headingley, though not badly enough for the players to come off yet.</p> <!-- Block 92 --> <p><strong>23rd over: South Africa 128-2 (chasing 276; Kallis 39, de Villiers 19)</strong> Another bowling change: Bopara for Flintoff, and his first over brings four no-risk runs for South Africa. How England could do with a middle-overs wickettaker in ODIs. The fear here is that Patel and Bopara bowl 10 overs, are milked easily for 55-60, and South Africa are left needing 100 from the last 17 overs.</p> <!-- Block 93 --> <p><strong>24th over: South Africa 132-2 (chasing 276; Kallis 41, de Villiers 21)</strong> Clare Davies sends a longish email about the history of the Modern Pentathlon. Just as I'm about to cut and paste it onto the OBO, the will to do so inexplicably drains out of me.</p> <!-- Block 94 --> <p><strong>25th over: South Africa 139-2 (chasing 276; Kallis 46, de Villiers 23)</strong> Short from Bopara, and Kallis's withering pull gets past, sliding round at deep midwicket. England are really struggling here, and I think he should give a two/three-over spell to Anderson, because they desperately need a wicket.</p> <!-- Block 95 --> <p><strong>26th over: South Africa 141-2 (chasing 276; Kallis 47, de Villiers 24)</strong> Pietersen is whirling his arms, which suggests he'll be on pretty soon. That's a risk because he bowls four-balls, but maybe his personality can buy a wicket. If England don't get one in the next five overs it's hard to see how they can win this game. Decent stuff from Patel, though: just two from the over and his figures are a very respectable 4-0-12-1.</p> <!-- Block 96 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 142-3 (De Villiers c Bell b Pietersen 24)</strong> Is there anything this bloke doesn't do? He desperately wanted a wicket, so he brought himself and got it in his first over. De Villiers, trying to clip a straight one over midwicket, only found the safe hands of Ian Bell.</p> <!-- Block 97 --> <p><strong>27th over: South Africa 142-3 (chasing 276; Kallis 48, Duminy 0)</strong> Now's surely the time to get Harmison or Anderson, or maybe even Flintoff for just two overs, on to try to bully the young lad Duminy.</p> <!-- Block 98 --> <p><strong>28th over: South Africa 146-3 (chasing 276; Kallis 51, Duminy 1)</strong> For now Patel continues, and Kallis drives him lazily through extra-cover to bring up a good fifty, from 62 balls and with seven fours. Duminy, a left-hander who averages 138 in ODIs this year, then gets off the mark with a premeditated lap for one.</p> <!-- Block 99 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 149-4 (Kallis run out 52)</strong> Another Pietersen over, another wicket, and this one is massive. Kallis tucked Pietersen to leg, but there was a mix-up with Duminy, and the fielder coming in from midwicket (Bell I think) did really well to sense that a) Kallis was the wicket they wanted and b) Kallis was struggling with his leg. He sent a sharp throw to Pietersen, who gleefully did the rest and celebrated long before it was confirmed by the third umpire. What's cricketese for Goldenballs?</p> <!-- Block 100 --> <p><strong>29th over: South Africa 149-4 (chasing 276; Duminy 3, Boucher 0)</strong> \"Pace Mr Copestake (21st Over) \"I'm tempted to adopt a Pynchonesque writing style, but I suspect it wouldn't match the culture of the OBO,\" says Gary Naylor. \"Lacking in snappiness, I feel. The bag over the head is an excellent suggestion though. Thomas Pynchon, John Merrick and me!\"</p> <!-- Block 101 --> <p><strong>30th over: South Africa 152-4 (chasing 276; Duminy 3, Boucher 3)</strong> KP gave Duminy a right mouthful after that wicket, presumably informing him that he's just cost South Africa the game. Should Pietersen stick or twist now? Does he carry on with the spinners and allow Boucher - a devastating death-hitter - to play himself in, even if it's only at three or four an over? Or does he give Flintoff two overs to try to nail Boucher and make England big favourites? For now he continues with Patel, and I'm not going to argue with that. Three from the over.</p> <!-- Block 102 --> <p><strong>31st over: South Africa 159-4 (chasing 276; Duminy 3, Boucher 9)</strong> Pietersen lets slip a high full-toss and Boucher smears it for four. Seven from the over, and that'll do for KP I reckon. He's more than done what he came on for.</p> <p>Tim Knights points out that Warwickshire are 17 for 7 chasing 200ish in the Pro40 against Glamorgan. At least they've got Ashley Giles coming in at No8 eh? Oh.</p> <!-- Block 103 --> <p><strong>32nd over: South Africa 166-4 (chasing 276; Duminy 4, Boucher 14)</strong> Boucher has looked really good so far, and in that over cleverly steers Patel for four. Patel has now bowled seven and Pietersen three, but they don't need to carry on. But I suspect they will, at the very least until the ball is replaced in two overs' time.</p> <!-- Block 104 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 167-5 (Boucher st Prior b Pietersen 16)</strong> Unbelievable. Boucher missed a sweep at Pietersen, but was remarkably slovenly when it came to dragging his back foot - which was on the line - back into the crease. That's amazingly negligent, and Pietersen has done it again. If he doesn't wake up tomorrow morning having dreamed about a cure for cancer - or at the very least a way to get George Lamb off the air - it will be a major surprise. He's having an unbelievable day.</p> <!-- Block 105 --> <p><strong>33rd over: South Africa 169-5 (chasing 276; Duminy 6, Botha 1)</strong> That was, we should also note in view of past incidents, a really smart piece of work from Matt Prior. Pietersen has doubled his ODI wickets tally. What this man has done since taking over is a complete joke.</p> <!-- Block 106 --> <p><strong>34th over: South Africa 172-5 (chasing 276; Duminy 8, Botha 2)</strong> England are all over South Africa now, and Pietersen even had a slip in for Patel against the new batsman Botha (ODI average: 18.00; List A average: 20.65). Botha responds by premeditating a sweep for a single. Duminy does likewise, and gets two, but England will take three from the over all night.</p> <p>\"So Darrell Hair has quit umpiring?\" sniffs Tom Hopkins. \"I have to say, I'm a bit disappointed. Stuffy and self important he may have been, but he did have the admirable quality of not being Rudi Koertzen.\"</p> <!-- Block 107 --> <p><strong>35th over: South Africa 180-5 (chasing 276; Duminy 9, Botha 9)</strong> Remarkably, SA are 38 runs ahead of England at this stage, although they've lost two more wickets. Pietersen's first ball with the newer ball is a disgusting full toss, and Botha swats it over midwicket for four. Pietersen then almost gets his third wicket: he tempted Duminy with a bit of flight, but Duminy's whip fell not far short of Broad at long-on.</p> <!-- Block 108 --> <p><strong>36th over: South Africa 187-5 (chasing 276; Duminy 14, Botha 11)</strong> Patel lures Botha into a leading edge, which plops safely into the covers. Duminy then steers one to third man, and some superb running brings three. Another decent over for South Africa - seven from it - and I reckon it's time to go back to the seamers.</p> <!-- Block 109 --> <p><strong>37th over: South Africa 190-5 (chasing 276; Duminy 16, Botha 12)</strong> A good move, this: Flintoff replaces Pietersen (5-0-22-2). There's a referral to third umpire second ball, but Botha was comfortably home. Wouldn't it be great if the third umpire got messed up on booze one day by accident and just started pressing the wrong button to mess with people's heads? Oh.</p> <p>Anyway it's really good stuff from Flintoff (is that tautologous?). Three from the over, and that means South Africa need 86 from 13 overs.</p> <!-- Block 110 --> <p><strong>38th over: South Africa 196-5 (chasing 276; Duminy 17, Botha 17)</strong> Botha reverse-sweeps Patel for four, and that's Patel's lot. He's done a really good job: 10-0-42-1.</p> <!-- Block 111 --> <p><strong>39th over: South Africa 202-5 (chasing 276; Duminy 18, Botha 20)</strong> The balance has shifted back towards South Africa, in the sense that England have removed their catchers. Six from a Flintoff over is worth eight or nine from anyone else's, so South Africa will be happy with that. </p> <p>They need 74 from 11 overs. Where's your money? Mine, I suppose, is dotted around London and Rochester in various watering holes, but that which remains I'm still putting on England. But it's a close thing because these two look like good players, and Botha in particular looks a lot better than his modest averages suggest.</p> <!-- Block 112 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 202-6 (Duminy c Prior b Harmison 18)</strong> Brilliant from Harmison, brilliant from Prior, brilliant from England, brilliant from life! Harmison really ramped up the pressure with three dot balls, and when Duminy felt for and snicked the fourth Prior took a good, tumbling catch. England are right back in the box seat now, feet up and demanding the remote.</p> <!-- Block 113 --> <p><strong>40th over: South Africa 205-6 (chasing 276; Botha 20, Philander 1)</strong> Oh Stephen Harmison. After that brilliant start, his first two balls to Philander are both wides. Philander is no mug by the way: he averages 29.73 in List A cricket and 40.00 in ODIs (though that's only from six games). After this, however, it's a mug's gallery: Nel, Steyn, someone else whose names escapes me. Ntini, that's it.</p> <p> <br>Here's Jim Harris. \"Surely that is the cricket equivalent of Goldenballs - or maybe it is Goldenswingers (TM The Fiver). Or if he was from Pakistan, Golden Reverse Swingers. I'm sure there is a some sort of gag to do with a stump but (a) I can't think of it and (b) it probably isn't firewall friendly\u2026\" Firewalls schmirewalls. You know what I say to firewalls? Balls to you, firewalls!</p> <!-- Block 114 --> <p><strong>41st over: South Africa 211-6 (chasing 276; Botha 23, Philander 3)</strong> Broad is on for Flintoff, whose last two overs are rightly being saved for the end. Botha thuds one into the ground and, as it bounces back towards his stumps, steers it away with the back of the bat. Six from the over, and that'll do for England, as South Africa now need 65 from nine overs.</p> <p>\"With 2012 on the horizon, can't we get KP to train up for a few Olympic sports in which we're still a bit short?\" says Justin Barrett. \"Greco-Roman wrestling..? Fencing..? Middle-distance running..?\"</p> <!-- Block 115 --> <p><strong>42nd over: South Africa 211-6 (chasing 276; Botha 23, Philander 3)</strong> A maiden from Harmison to Philander. Excellent stuff, and the required run-rate is ticking up faster than one of those old-school train boards: South Africa now need 8.12 from each of the last eight overs. Meanwhile, the camera cuts to a seriously big-boned man with an egg-white goatee. \"Look at Mike Gatting\" deadpans Bumble.</p> <p>\"I guess the selectors' punts tonight are Patel, Prior and, to some extent, Harmison. It appears that they have all done well. Is this the start of building a squad of 16 ODI cricketers to rotate through the international programme as conditions dictate?\" says Gary Naylor. \"It's a nice thought.\" I have a couple of other nice thoughts which I suspect won't eventuate any time soon; even though it's after the watershed, it's probably best they're kept in-house.</p> <!-- Block 116 --> <p><strong>43rd over: South Africa 215-6 (chasing 276; Botha 24, Philander 5)</strong> The squeeze is really on now, and Philander can barely get it off the square. Four from the over means the target is 61 from seven.</p> <p>Andrew Losowsky has just emerged from his DeLorean, panting furiously but with one helluva story to tell. \"England will of course win this game, Pietersen will be hailed as a combination of Diego Maradona, Viv Richards and the lord Jaysus Chris, and tomorrow's newspapers will be filled with steaming praise and shouts of 'BRING ON THE AUSSIES!'. Then we'll lose this series 4-1, Pietersen will be reviled as a South African babykiller who never really cared for the English flag, and Stuart Broad will be handed the one-day captaincy because he drew a Jack when the others only got numbered cards. And your name is Kolley Kibber and I claim my five pounds.\"</p> <!-- Block 117 --> <p><strong>44th over: South Africa 219-6 (chasing 276; Botha 26, Philander 7)</strong> Harmison is really bullying Philander, driving him back into his crease. Philander is trying to play orthodox shots but, as Nasser observes, he just needs to have a big yahoo at one of these. Finally he does, and it plops pitifully short of mid-on. Just four singles from the over. Cashback!</p> <p>Here's Phil Sawyer. \"Dear Apple, could you explain why iTunes is saying the 60s ska tunes I'VE JUST BLOODY BOUGHT OFF YOU are not authorized to be played on my pc? Hang on, this is the Apple support address isn't it? Does that mean I've just been telling Apple about the joys of Reality Suppressor?\" More to the point: Dear Phil Sawyer, could you explain why you've JUST BLOODY BOUGHT 60s SKA TUNES?</p> <!-- Block 118 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 219-7 (Botha c Bresnan b Broad 26)</strong> And that, surely, is that. Botha picked Broad up from off stump, but could only ping it towards deep midwicket, from where the substitute Tim Bresnan ran in to take a smart, tumbling catch.</p> <!-- Block 119 --> <p><strong>45th over: South Africa 221-7 (chasing 276; Philander 8, Nel 1)</strong> So now the target is 55 from the last five overs, two of which will be bowled by Andrew Flintoff. Slim just left town.</p> <!-- Block 120 --> <p><strong>46th over: South Africa 229-7 (chasing 276; Philander 14, Nel 3)</strong> Philander whips Harmison through square leg for four. Harmison ends with figures of 10-1-43-2.</p> <!-- Block 121 --> <p><strong>47th over: South Africa 240-7 (chasing 276; Philander 21, Nel 6)</strong> South Africa's tailenders are going down swinging - Philander top-edges one roundhouse yahoo to third man and then blitzes Broad down the ground for four - but the game is almost up now. They need 36 from three overs.</p> <!-- Block 122 --> <p><strong>48th over: South Africa 243-7 (chasing 276; Philander 23, Nel 7)</strong> Flintoff tightens the noose with a superb death over that brings just three runs, and South Africa need 33 from the last two overs.</p> <!-- Block 123 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 245-8 (Philander run out 23)</strong> The bowler Broad follows through to run out Philander, trying to steal a quick single, with a direct hit.</p> <!-- Block 124 --> <p><strong>49th over: South Africa 249-8 (chasing 276; Nel 10, Steyn 3)</strong> Broad ends with figures of 10-0-61-1. \"I realise buying stuff by the Upsetters and the Maytals may not fit with Big Paper's penchant for moody singer song writers but I prefer, oh you know, music that gets you dancing rather than music to slit your throat by,\" says Phil Sawyer. \"Call me old-fashioned.\" Grandad.</p> <!-- Block 125 --> <p><strong>WICKET! South Africa 249-9 (Nel b Flintoff 10)</strong> Nel walks across his stumps; Flintoff cleans him up with the yorker. It's Flintoff's 150th ODI wicket, and I don't too many Englishman have achieved that feat. Gough certainly. Botham?</p> <!-- Block 126 --> <p><strong>WICKET: South Africa 255 all out (Ntini b Flintoff 2); ENGLAND WIN BY 20 RUNS</strong> Flintoff yorks Ntini, and England go 1-0 up in the series. The key, unusually for Headingley, was spin: Samit Patel and particularly Kevin Pietersen turned the game at a time when South Africa were cruising, and in the end England won comfortably.</p> <p>It's a real feelgood victory, this: everything Pietersen did in the field came off (oh, and he got 90 not out), Andrew Flintoff batted with a big smile and a big bat on his way to 78, Steve Harmison returned to one-day cricket with a big wicket in his first over and excellent figures of two for 43, and Matt Prior kept wicket flawlessly.</p> <p>It wasn't perfect - don't get me started on Ian Bell's innings; I'm in a good mood - but it was a lot better than many of us expected. And the best thing is that the whole England team looked like they had a bloody good time. As did I.

  "<p><br>Not quite the PR master-stroke ... Moritz Bleibtreu in Der Baader Meinhof Komplex</p> <p>News arrives of trouble lapping at a forthcoming movie devoted to a pivotal moment in modern German history. For once, however, the blighted Valkyrie is off the hook - the problem child this time is <a href=\"http://www.bmk.film.de/\">Der Baader Meinhof Komplex</a>, a prestige account of the life of the Red Army Faction, written and overseen by the producer of the much-lauded Downfall, which despite a choice pedigree has blundered into the roughest of PR waters.</p> <p>As <a href=\"http://daily.greencine.com/archives/006529.html#\">reported by David Hudson at Green Cine Daily</a>, it's already habitual for American studios nursing a clunker to skip the niceties of screening the movie for the press, or to do so only with embargoes in place to confine bad buzz. But the ante has been conclusively upped by those responsible for Baader Meinhof, directed by veteran Uli Edel. Prior to attending a German preview screening of the film this week, invitees were first required to sign a contract barring them from writing or even speaking about it afterwards until close to the film's release date next month - with the penalty a fine of \u20ac100,000 (the better part of \u00a380,000) divided between the journalist themselves and their outlet.</p> <p>Absurdly heavy-handed and instantly redolent of what-have-you-got-to-hide, it's tempting to think the whole thing must have been conceived as a stunt to play on the severity with which the German state responded to the early arsons and bank robberies of the RAF; 100,000 marks being the sum that was placed on each of the gang members' heads on the infamous <a href=\"http://www.imageandnarrative.be/worldmusica/images/15wanted.jpg\">Wanted posters</a> issued in 1971.</p> <p>And yet if so (quite apart from that idea's dubious taste), the German press don't appear to have been let in on the joke - with the national journalists' union <a href=\"http://www.djv.de/SingleNews.20.0.html?&amp;tx_ttnews[tt_news]=1519&amp;tx_ttnews[backPid]=21&amp;cHash=d36c1e8486\">DJV</a> making a public protest, German papers including the prominent Der Tagesspiegel and S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung blowing the whistle on the producers' antics (the latter have a copy of the contract reproduced <a href=\"http://www.sueddeutsche.de/kultur/940/305905/text/\">here</a>), and Hudson quoting the online journalist <a href=\"http://www.heise.de/tp/r4/artikel/28/28535/1.html\">R\u00fcdiger Suchsland</a> as declaiming: \"Obviously, Der Baader Meinhof Komplex is a botched film. There's no other explanation for [producers] Constantin's loss of control and hysterical behavior. There's a fear that word of the poor quality of the film will get out.\"</p> <p>So, not quite the PR masterstroke. And it's a gaffe made stranger by the apparently sturdy foundations on which Edel's film has been built; while Valkyrie contained a kernel of risibility from the get-go, everything about Der Baader Meinhof Komplex screams impeccably high-end: the internationally-acclaimed precedent of Downfall, an A-list cast (including The Lives of Others' Martina Gedeck, Run Lola Run's Moritz Bliebtrau and Bruno Ganz essaying doughy police chief Horst Herold) - and the source material of journalist Stefan Aust's book on the gang (long out of print in the UK but due to re-emerge when the film comes out here in the autumn) outstanding in a field not untouched by the glib or partial.</p> <p>Yet now, just weeks before its release, the project is, in Germany at least, the subject of anger and ridicule. And if R\u00fcdiger Suchsland is right and the film proves to be a tank, then that's a shame for reasons other than the fortunes of the producers and PR functionaries. After all, despite their spectral hold over many imaginations - revenants of a time when a gaggle of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Baader\">petty criminals</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulrike_Meinhof\">magazine journalists</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holger_Meins\">student cinematographers</a> in crushed velvet and stolen BMWs could all but unhinge an entire liberal democracy - and various fragments of their story having appeared on screen before, the goal remains open for a definitive portrait on film more than 30 years after the disputed events at Stammheim Prison that left Andreas Baader and two of the gang's other principals dead.</p> <p>Of course, for all the rancour, the fiasco could yet prove to be a mere false start. Yet even so, that still leaves the project tainted by a bizarrely draconian display of commercial interests - quite the irony, eh? Still, I'm sure Tom Cruise and Bryan Singer are grateful for the breathing space.</p>",
  "<p>The bullet Graham Henry dodged last week now has Peter de Villiers as its target. The South Africa coach is under fire after three defeats in four Tri-Nations matches: another one tomorrow against Australia in Durban would condemn them to the wooden spoon.</p> <p>It would be some comedown after last October's World Cup success and de Villiers has not perhaps helped his cause this week by blaming senior players for the Springboks' plight. He was a surprise choice to succeed Jake White, but it is not just a new coach the Boks are contending with: they are also struggling with the experimental law variations.</p> <p>The ELVs were always more likely to impact more on South Africa than New Zealand or Australia because the Boks, as they showed in the World Cup, were almost European in their structured approach to the game. Set-pieces and defence were significant factors behind their success in France last year and they were undone against New Zealand in Cape Town last week by their attempt to play a wide game.</p> <p>South Africa's backs did make some impression against the New Zealand defence, but their forwards struggled to get to the breakdown and conceded any number of turnovers. Richie McCaw became the game's dominant figure and if any one moment signified the impact the ELVs have made, it was the replacement of the flanker Schalk Burger on the hour.</p> <p>Burger was a seminal figure under White, physically imposing and direct, but his impact is more marginal in the more expansive tactics devised by de Villiers. Butch James, the controlling influence in France, is also struggling, but that may also be a legacy of more than a year's non-stop rugby, ditto with Percy Montgomery.</p> <p>Had the Boks had someone to match McCaw in the tackle area, they would probably have won last week with something to spare. They ran some intelligent lines and used the threat of Bryan Habana cleverly, but the profound change de Villiers is looking to make will take time. His problem is that the demand for results is instant and, like Henry last week, he needs any sort of victory.</p> <p>Australia's Robbie Deans is also in his first year in charge but, unlike de Villiers, was not burdened by expectation. Two victories against the All Blacks and the Springboks have cemented him in the job and the Wallabies are the slight favourites to win the Tri-Nations, five points behind New Zealand, whose remaining game is in Australia, with a game in hand. The final weekend could see Deans and Henry plotting against each other with the title at stake.</p> <p>South Africa's interest in the title looks academic: they need two bonus point victories over Australia in their final matches without giving anything away to overtake New Zealand, but de Villiers is looking to the longer term, as he had to with the introduction of the variations. A problem for him is that he has been inconsistent in selection - Montgomery was chosen on sentiment last week - and goodwill towards him has evaporated.</p> <p>A disappointing feature of last week's match was the lack of offloading in contact. The variations were supposed to lead to more fluidity, but there is at least as much whistle as ever and teams are happy to kick the ball away knowing that turnover ball is the best to attack from.</p> <p>The Air New Zealand Cup is a better advert for the ELVs than the Tri-Nations and in devising his tactics, de Villiers has bound himself by the spirit of the variations rather than the reality of them. They have not changed a huge amount: ball-in-play time was higher in most of Wales's Six Nations matches this year than it has been in the Tri series so far and the Welsh mastered the art of the kick-and-chase.</p> <p>By blaming players and the referee Matt Goddard for the defeat to the All Blacks, de Villiers only heaped more pressure on himself. He has confined himself to one unforced change, Conrad Jantjes for Montgomery, but if the Springboks prevail in a match which a couple of months ago looked a home banker, it will be because the spirit of the World Cup has been recaptured rather than any affinity with the enigmatic variations.</p>",
  "<p>The National Union of Students has been criticised for failing to effectively tackle racism in its ranks.</p> <p>Black students have spoken out after a series of alleged incidents that have occurred at recent student union events.</p> <p>Bellavia Ribeirio-Addy, NUS black students' officer, claimed these incidents were not dealt with in an acceptable way.</p> <p>Black students claim the latest incident took place at an NUS training event last week, during which a students' union officer allegedly held up a poster saying \"Bring back slavery!\" as a joke. At the same meeting, the complainants alleged, another NUS officer used racist stereotypes in a role play exercise in which black students were referred to as \"undesirable\" because they encourage gun and knife crime.</p> <p>Ribeirio-Addy says senior members of the NUS national executive committee, who are responsible for directing union staff and implementing policy, were present at the meeting, but failed to intervene.</p> <p>\"It is unacceptable that black students should have to put up with blatant racist stereotypes at NUS events. It is unacceptable that slavery can be treated as a joke,\" she said.</p> <p>\"It is unacceptable that nothing was done about this by the senior NUS NEC members present, and it was only when [I] was involved that action was taken. This only happened because a distressed black student who felt it hadn't been dealt with immediately contacted me.</p> <p>\"This whole process took nearly three hours, and included me having to contact the NUS president. Incidents of racism should be dealt with immediately,\" she added.</p> <p>Ribeirio-Addy said it was not the first time that \"the needs and concerns of black students\" had been ignored.</p> <p>A few months ago a black NUS officer alleged she was told her brother's name was \"too foreign sounding\" to be used in promotional materials for the NUS discount card.</p> <p>There have also been allegations that at an event earlier in the summer, Muslim students had to eat their dinner behind a screen, separated from other delegates, as a non-alcoholic venue had not been provided.</p> <p>Following the complaints over the discount card, the NUS agreed that all the union's NEC members should receive compulsory equality training.</p> <p>Wes Streeting, the NUS president, said in a statement: \"It goes without saying that NUS takes the issues of equal opportunities and safe space very seriously and I am thus determined that the allegations are handled properly.\"</p> <p>He said investigations into all the allegations were underway.</p> <p>He added: \"It is important in both instances that we do not tolerate racism or a failure to deal with it; it is however also important that we do not pre-judge the outcome of any investigation.\"</p> <p>Ribeirio-Addy has now called for NUS events to have a clear statement against racism, and for support for black students who speak out against NUS officers who make racist comments. She is also calling for no event to be organised to the exclusion of Muslim students.</p>",
  "<p>August can be the cruellest month in Hollywood. Too late for blockbuster season and its attendant box office propaganda and too soon for September's return to interesting fare, August nestles there like a low-yield aberration on the releasing calendar. This is the time when Hollywood goes on vacation before the festival frenzy of Venice and Toronto ushers in the awards season. This is traditionally a time to clear the decks of the oddities, the movies that haven't tracked well or those that feature untested stars. August is where movies go to die. But that said, there may be a few surprises in store.</p> <p>When Sony releases its comedy The House Bunny today, America could be about to witness the birth of a star. Anna Faris is already well known as the lead in the Scary Movie horror spoof franchise and for that scene-stealing turn as the ditzy celebrity in Lost in Translation. However until now she's never been called upon to open a major stand-alone movie. She rose through the ranks on Scary Movie \u2013 she started as part of an ensemble and is now undoubtedly the franchise's jewel in the crown \u2013 but The House Bunny is the first time she has been front and centre of a sizeable studio release.</p> <p>No pressure, then. But I reckon Faris will come up smelling of roses. Her natural comic gifts have charmed the critics once again and this story from the screenwriters behind Legally Blonde may not have the chops to reach number one, but it could be enough to catapult its Seattle-born star into the big league. Some critics even went as far as to say she resembles a young Goldie Hawn and while I think that's fair, I believe Faris will impress everyone with her range in the future. But for now she's a funny girl and there's always room in filmgoers' hearts for a giggly, adorable bombshell. According to the box office experts The House Bunny will end up in the top five and may gross up to $15m (\u00a38m) in its first three days.</p> <p>Rainn Wilson is another rising star in action this weekend, albeit one whose parameters may be a little more modest. Wilson has benefited hugely from his role as the foil to Steve Carell in the US version of The Office and tackles his first lead in Fox's comedy The Rocker. Britain's Peter Cattaneo of The Full Monty fame directed Wilson as a failed drummer from a rock band who gets a second bite at the cherry. </p> <p>The studios are prepared to push buttons when it comes to promoting their movies and this one has been no exception. The Rocker opened on Wednesday this week, a strategy that has become de rigueur of late, and Fox had the chutzpah to start calling The Rocker \"The sleeper hit of the summer\" on its billboard campaign more than a week before it opened.</p> <p>Most people expect Death Race to streak past the finishing line first this weekend. The remake of Roger Corman's 1975 violent action thriller Death Race 2000 stars our very own Jason Statham in the David Carradine role as a convict whose driving skills come in handy while he's in the clink. Tyrese Gibson reprises Sylvester Stallone's role as the baddie Machine Gun Joe. Britain's Paul W S Anderson, who counts Resident Evil and Event Horizon on his resume, directed the mayhem. Statham has a huge following in the States and has the clout to open a movie, although audiences have seen plenty of action this summer and it may struggle to get past $20m in its first weekend.</p> <p>And while we're on the subject of actors tying to be find that recognition they deserve, it would be remiss to ignore Steve Coogan. It must be \u2013 what? galling? depressing? \u2013 for Coogan to watch the meteoric Hollywood rise of his compatriots Rickey Gervais and Simon Pegg while he, a longtime TV star, is still trying to find the key to success in the movies over here. After the theatrical disappointments of Around the World in 80 Days and Alibi, it is the turn of Hamlet 2, a raucous comedy about a drama teacher who stages a controversial school play, to bring Coogan the success he richly deserves.</p> <p>The movie drew a wild response when it premiered at Sundance last January and proved a timely antidote to the festival, which was overall rather dark in tone. Focus Features swooped on worldwide rights for approximately $10m (\u00a35.4m) \u2013 a huge deal that will need to bear fruit. The movie gets a tiny launch this weekend so the name of the game will be per-theatre averages, a pound-for-pound evaluation in which a distributor divides the overall gross by the number of cinemas it is playing in. Hamlet 2 will expand into further cinemas next weekend.</p> <p>Ice Cube is a well-established star and takes the lead in a new sports drama called The Longshots, directed by former Limp Bizkit frontman Fred Durst and released through MGM. Estimates put it in the $6m (\u00a33.2m) opening weekend range. Lest we forget, The Dark Knight and Tropic Thunder remain active and both will expect top five finishes.</p> <p>The Dark Knight enters its sixth weekend on approximately $480m (\u00a3257.1m) and could end the weekend close to $500m (\u00a3267.8m), while Tropic Thunder will drop around 50% in its second weekend and is looking at boosting its tally by about $15m (\u00a38m) to the low $60m (\u00a332.1m) mark.</p>",
  "<p>The first trailer for the Oscar-tipped drama Towelhead, which is directed by American Beauty writer Alan Ball, <a href=\"http://reelsuave.com/2008/08/22/first-look-towelhead/\">has hit the web</a>. The film, which is based on Alicia Erian's novel Nothing is Private, centres on a young Arab-American girl struggling to deal with her own sexual awakening, a strict Lebanese father and the attentions of a paedophile neighbour in suburban Houston. It stars Aaron Eckhart, Toni Colette and Summer Bishil (in the main role) and is due for a late September release in the States.</p> <p>There are distinct rumblings of discontent over on the set of the forthcoming Wolverine movie, starring Hugh Jackman as the titular, adamantine-clawed X-Man. <a href=\"http://hollywood-elsewhere.com/2008/08/hes_the_boss.php\">According to a Hollywood Elsewhere report</a> which has been widely re-reported in the US, director Gavin Hood and executive producer Tom Rothman of 20th Century Fox have been engaged in a bizarre battle for control over the film's look. Hood reportedly wants a moody superhero flick in the vein of The Dark Knight, while Rothman favours a bouncy Iron Man style blockbuster. The spat came to a head after Hood was detained elsewhere for a few hours, returning to discover that an entire, sombrely decorated set had been painted top to bottom in bright colours.</p> <p>Smoking in films encourages children to smoke cigarettes, <a href=\"http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117990929.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1\">Variety says</a>, according to a US government report which advocates including anti-smoking adverts before any movies which depict characters lighting up. The National Cancer Institute said cigarettes were seen on screen in three quarters of films which reach cinemas. Last year, ratings body the Motion Picture Association of America said it would start considering smoking when making its decisions, while more recently six major studios promised to carry anti-smoking ads on DVDs releases which featured cigarettes.</p>",
  "<p>The judgment given by the high court yesterday in the case of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/aug/22/uksecurity.guantanamo\">Binyam Mohamed</a> opens up the real prospect that the international law and rule of law transgressions of the \"war on terror\" will unravel in British courts. Never before has so much been disclosed of the real extent of the British government's complicity even though much of the hearing was in closed sessions using special advocates and the only <a href=\"http://image.theguardian.com/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2008/08/21/mohamed_full210808.pdf\">judgment</a> we have access to is the \"open\" one.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/21/guantanamo.terrorism\">Binyam Mohamed</a> is the only British resident left in Guant\u00e1namo Bay. Although all the other residents have been returned the US has refused to bring him back to the UK on the grounds that he is to be put on trial before a military commission which could impose the death penalty.</p> <p>Clive Stafford Smith, Binyam's lawyer asked the UK government to disclose information in its possession which could help prove that he had been the subject of extraordinary rendition to Pakistan and then Morocco and had been tortured at the behest of the US on the basis that this might then persuade the US convening authority in charge of the military commissions to withdraw the charges against him. The court found that such information should be disclosed but has given the foreign secretary, David Milliband, further time to consider the security implications.</p> <p>The information in British possession came about because of the involvement of the British security services in Binyam's murky story. They were involved in the questioning of Binyam in Pakistan when he was detained unlawfully incommunicado and without access to a lawyer from May to September 2002. Witness B from the security services who gave evidence in secret at the hearing and at one point refused to answer questions because of possible self-incrimination of war crimes not only worked with the US on the questioning but told Binyam that he would not help him unless he cooperated fully with the US. </p> <p>In the event the help he promised did not materialise and after September 2002, when Binyam reports being rendered to Morocco, the British security services continued to \"facilitate interviews by the United States authorities ... when also they knew BM was still incommunicado and when they must also have appreciated that he was not in a United States facility and that the facility in which he was being detained and questioned was that of a foreign government.\" </p> <p>Binyam alleges that his torture in Morocco included his penis being cut with a scalpel. Although the judgment makes no finding on this it contains pointed observations about the failure of the US to respond to the torture allegations calling its position \"untenable\"</p> <p>The judgment makes a clear finding of complicity:</p> <blockquote> <p>By seeking to interview BM in the circumstances described and supplying information and questions for his interviews, the relationship of the United Kingdom Government to the United States authorities in relation to BM was far beyond that of a bystander or witness to the alleged wrongdoing.</p> </blockquote> <p>It is this which now really puts the cat among the pigeons. During the war on terror both MI5 and MI6 have flown around the world giving assistance to the US by providing information and conducting interviews with detainees known to them. They are known to have questioned people detained by the US in Afghanistan, Iraq and Guant\u00e1namo Bay and are believed to have assisted in renditions such as that of Jamil el Banna and Bisher Al-Rawi from the Gambia to Afghanistan and then Guant\u00e1namo. </p> <p>The full extent of British \"facilitation\" has not yet come out but this action could be the tip of an iceberg. Did the British allow <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Garcia\">Diego Garcia</a> to be used as a secret prison? Does our government or security services know of other <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jun/08/usa.uknews4\">secret prisons</a> or arrangements with foreign governments? My firm is among others in bringing claims for damages and crucially a demand for a public inquiry by ex-Guant\u00e1namo detainees against the British government and security services for British collusion in the human rights abuses they suffered. </p> <p>But really we should not now have to wait for the courts to pronounce on these matters. The last time we heard the words \"ethical foreign policy\" was years ago in the time of the late <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/aug/08/guardianobituaries.labour\">Robin Cook</a> but they could have reappeared in the recent article by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/29/davidmiliband.labour\">David Miliband</a>. </p> <p>Instead of waiting for more shaming disclosures of the same kind as in this judgment the government could make a real break with the moral equivalence of the Blair government by setting up a public inquiry and devising a new code for the security services to ensure they never \"facilitate\" torture and abuse again. If they do not do so it is increasingly clear that the UK courts will stand up to the executive on such fundamental government wrongdoing. </p> <p><em>Louise Christian of Christian Khan solicitors acted for some of the detainees released from Guant\u00e1namo Bay</em></p>",
  "<p>The last week has seen a <a href=\"http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3580576,00.html\">flurry</a> of statements from the Palestine National Authority's Fatah leaders and others about a <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSLA58012320080810?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=topNews\">bi-national state</a> in Israel/Palestine. Ahmed Qureia, chief Palestinian negotiator at the anaemic peace talks, warned that if a two-state agreement was not reached soon, the Palestinians would demand equal rights in the entire territory <a href=\"http://www.imemc.org/article/56481\">under Israeli rule</a>. President Abbas made virtually the same statement a few days later, and Professor Sari Nusseibeh, president of Al Quds University in Jerusalem, predicted a bi-national outcome to the conflict in an interview last Friday \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1011859.html\"> though as a gradual process over centuries.</a></p> <p>The idea itself is far from new. Zionist intellectuals backed it when the Jews were a minority in Palestine. After the six-day war, Yasser Arafat, leader of the PLO, proposed setting up a democratic, secular state for Arabs and Jews; the Palestinians as equals, not refugees as they were then seen. Hamas today envisions an Islamic state in all of Palestine: an Israeli nightmare. The new statements by Fatah leaders look like a tactic to prevent the collapse of talks, attract international support, and keep their Hamas rivals at bay. It is not difficult to see what has encouraged them; the problem is that the move may have the opposite result to that intended.</p> <p>Fatah is aware of Israeli concern about \"the demographic problem\" \u2013 the fact that soon the Palestinian population of Israel and the land under occupation, now almost at parity, will outnumber Jews. <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/854051.html\">The Winograd Commission's findings</a> on the 2006 Lebanon war showed that using the army to police the West Bank had damaged it as a fighting force. Israel cannot expel or \"transfer\" the Palestinians under its control, and has no wish to govern them. Recent negotiations have brought the two sides very close to an agreement; but rightwing settlers and their supporters in shaky Israeli government coalitions oppose withdrawal, and Fatah have Hamas waiting for them to fail and return to the armed struggle. Fatah may feel that Israel will only go the extra mile on the refugees and Jerusalem \u2013 the main sticking points \u2013 if the alternative means governing an Arab majority demanding its democratic rights in the international forum: a challenge which Israel has never faced. Resolutions against Israel have been passed in the international court of justice against settlement policy in the West Bank; boycotts are threatened against Israeli professionals abroad. The composition of the UN has changed since the general assembly approved <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1947_UN_Partition_Plan\">the partition of Palestine in l947</a>. The growth of the electronic media has advertised the plight of dispossessed West Bank Palestinians. Israeli liberals are publicly concerned that the settlement drive is irreversible and that a bi-national state is already in existence, Israel no longer a democracy.</p> <p>So the threat of an appeal to the UN looks like resonating both internationally and in Israel itself. But it carries huge dangers. </p> <p>A majority of Israelis are now known to be in favour of concessions for a genuine peace. But the bi-national proposal \u2013 meaning the end of the Jewish state \u2013 may so alarm many that they may prefer prolonging the occupation in the hope that the Palestinians will ultimately give up and emigrate.</p> <p>In Jerusalem, a bi-national city, both sides are overwhelmingly hostile to and suspicious of one another. A century of bloodshed and fear, the gap between the Israeli and Palestinian economies, irreconcilable political cultures \u2013 all make bi-nationalism utopian. Liberal Israelis are the most eloquent and knowledgeable of Palestine's supporters, civil rights activists catalogue Israel's abuses; but the mass of the electorate is indifferent, all the more so because its contacts with West Bank Palestinians are now limited by the physical barriers surrounding them and the veto on Israeli travel outside the Jewish settlements. Israel may be unpopular in liberal western circles, but this has little practical impact. Even in countries overtly hostile to Israel, arms and other deals continue. So if the Palestinians, backed by a substantial number of UN members, were to press for a bi-national state, the US and Europe would certainly block any such resolution. The best that could be hoped for would be for the US to put pressure on Israel on further concessions for a <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=383879&amp;contrassID=2&amp;subContrassID=1&amp;sbSubContrassID=0&amp;listSrc=Y\">two-state solution</a>. Which \u2013 to repeat \u2013 is almost certainly the objective of the current, if risky, statements by the Palestinian Authority.</p>",

  "<p>An uninspiring 0-0 draw at home is the kind of result which can send pre-season optimism floating away for another year. For around 300 Wealdstone supporters who saw the <a href=\"http://www.tonykempster.co.uk/ilp.htm\">Isthmian League</a> side make an underwhelming start to their campaign in English football's seventh tier on Saturday, the novelty of having a home ground to play on at all should mean August's euphoria lingers at least until the leaves start turning.</p> <p>Following the sale of their Lower Mead home to Tesco in 1991, <a href=\"http://wealdstone-fc.com/index.php5\">Wealdstone</a> \u2013 alma mater of Stuart Pearce, Vinnie Jones and Leeds hitman Jermaine Beckford \u2013 endured 17 years of ground sharing. The club survived this purgatory thanks to a committed hardcore of supporters and, in a time when non-league clubs run the extinction gauntlet like never before, has emerged from its exile with the unlikely prize of a new stadium.</p> <p>In 1985 Wealdstone won an unprecedented Conference and FA Trophy double, two tantalising years before automatic promotion to the Football League was introduced. A spectacular decline followed this Icarian flight. Boardroom impropriety meant the club never received the full proceeds from selling its ground. What money it did get went into a disastrous sharing arrangement with Watford. By the time the Stones limped away from Vicarage Road in the mid-1990s, they were insolvent and had suffered several relegations.</p> <p>At this low ebb the club passed into the hands of its fans. In the absence of any home ground to generate income, supporters subconsciously adopted their b\u00eate noire's 'every little helps' slogan and sponsored walks, race nights, bucket collections and golden goal competitions have helped keep the Stones alive ever since. Wealdstone's nomadic status often saw them dubbed the Rolling Stones and they certainly share a healthy aversion to death with the sexagenarian rockers.</p> <p>An opportunity to come in from the cold unexpectedly presented itself late last year when the debt-ridden leaseholders of Grosvenor Vale, home to Spartan League side Ruislip Manor, approached Wealdstone desperate for investment. A consortium swiftly purchased a majority shareholding in the site and, suddenly, a football club in need of a ground had acquired one.</p> <p>Most football fans spend the summer months learning to recognise wives and daughters again but the Wealdstone faithful devoted the close season to getting their new home up to Isthmian League standards: from painting, weeding and removing rubbish to repairing terracing, seating and turnstiles; replacing the PA system; digging drainage ditches and building new dugouts. </p> <p>A remarkable effort was directed by two long-term supporters Don Cross and Mike Kane and it wasn't the first time Cross had answered an SOS from the club. In 1988 he was plucked from the terraces to play for the first team when, embarrassingly, they couldn't put a full side out for an away game. \"This work was more significant for the club because anybody could have stepped in and taken my place on the pitch that day but this was about moving forward,\" says Cross. \"I played for Wealdstone as a supporter and I still support them now. That's what this club's about, a lot of people from a long time ago still find it important.\"</p> <p>This renaissance is both an inspirational and cautionary tale. Wealdstone maintain Ruislip Manor were offered a fair deal to share with their new landlords but the smaller club refused and relocated, changing their name in the process. There may be some irony in the Stones' involvement in another club's exile from a traditional home but, having suffered more than their fair share of misfortune, Stones supporters tend to reserve sentimentality for their own team.</p> <p>Margins are tight when you can't even guarantee 300 spectators and several other north London non-league clubs are currently in financial difficulty. Stones chairman <a href=\"http://howiejk.wordpress.com/\">Howard Krais</a> recognises that pragmatism is the only appropriate mindset in the semi-professional game. \"There are too many clubs in this area, all at a relatively similar level and all swimming against the tide,\" he says. \"Only the healthiest clubs will survive, those that have financial investment and are well-run as football clubs and community organisations.\"</p> <p>Supporters hope recent graduate Jermaine Beckford's Leeds exploits will eventually provide a healthy cash injection thanks to a sell-on clause but adding bodies to the home gate will prove a more enduring windfall. Their supporter profile mirrors that of the average non-league fan: a middle-aged man who started following his local team in the 1960s or 1970s, pre-Premier League and pre-saturation TV coverage. Wealdstone have taken steps in the right direction, building links with existing junior sides in the area and offering free tickets to youngsters in the hope that a new generation of supporters will grow with the club.</p> <p>There's no disguising Grosvenor Vale is a modest premises, even by the standards of some of the other Isthmian League teams. This is a level of football where crows sometimes out-sing the supporters and criticism of players can echo cruelly around a near-empty ground. The club aspires to return to the Conference one day but that gap currently feels as wide as the one between the Premier League and League Two. But what Wealdstone's tenacious supporters have done is give their club a chance to increase support and revenue; an invigorating move in stark contrast to the moribund atmosphere of some non-league teams.</p> <p>So the players may not have risen to the occasion on Saturday, failing to put Tonbridge Angels to the sword despite the opposition keeper getting sent off in the first half, but maybe just for once the result was secondary. As Mike Kane, one of those who toiled all summer, put it: \"I think some people thought we were just going for another ground-share but the catalytic moment was when the main stand was painted blue. People came in and saw they were our colours. Knowing it's your friends who have grafted make you realise that you're part of this club.\"</p>",
  "<p>After last weekend's biblical deluge in Northern Ireland comes the political storms.</p> <p>Following a week when floods filled a Belfast underpass on the arterial link to Dublin with 26ft of water and the unseasonal monsoon-like downpour caused millions of pounds of damages to homes and businesses, the forecast for the power-sharing executive's survival is as gloomy as the ones for the north of Ireland's weather. </p> <p>Senior Irish and British officials currently sound like prophets of doom when you speak to them about the durability of the coalition headed up by Sinn F\u00e9in and the Democratic Unionists. The two main parties are engaged in an increasingly nasty form of shadow boxing and the other politicians at Stormont jibe that the inability of the devolved government to meet even once since June is evidence that the two main forces in the cabinet can't even bear being in the same room as each other. </p> <p>In fact there is a direct link between the appalling weather Northern Ireland has experienced over what used to be known as \"the summer\" and the menacing clouds looming over the political settlement in Stormont. Because even though the region suffered the worst floods in living memory the Northern Ireland executive failed to hold a cabinet meeting to respond to the crisis. Instead of joined-up government we had, to quote the SDLP MP Alasdair McDonnell, individual ministers on solo runs ringing up DUP finance minister Nigel Dodds to ask him for money. McDonnell was entirely accurate yesterday when he claimed that the executive \"is doing no corporate business\". </p> <p>So why can't the first minister, Peter Robinson, call a meeting of all his ministers?</p> <p>The answer is that relations between his party, the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in are as febrile and unstable as the physical atmosphere above Northern Ireland at present. The reasons for this are due to a number of outstanding and unresolved issues that still threaten to destabilise and possibly bring down the power-sharing deal worked out at St Andrews just under two years ago. </p> <p>The man in charge of handling two of the critical issues \u2013 the proposed multi-sports stadium on the former Maze prison site and and Irish Language Act \u2013 is the DUP MP Gregory Campbell. The minister of culture, arts and leisure is known to be adamantly opposed to building the Maze stadium and with it some kind of commemorative centre in homage to republican prisoners who died on hunger strike. </p> <p>In addition Campbell, along with the DUP, is deeply sceptical about enshrining an Irish Language Act in law which would put Gaelic on par with English. Apart from increasing unionist alienation, any such act - the hard-headed thrifty DUP ministers believe - could run up an unnecessary public bill in the tens of millions as all government and official documents would have to be translated into Gaelic by law. Yet both the act and the Maze are key Sinn F\u00e9in demands as part of their continued presence in the executive. </p> <p>Most critical of all is the question of policing and justice and when it will be devolved from London to Belfast. Unionist insiders say the DUP is getting increasingly nervous over the prospect of a local minister, especially a Sinn F\u00e9in one, controlling either the police or judicial matters. They say Robinson and co are fearful of an electoral backlash come the European elections next June when they try to unseat the ex-DUP MEP Jim Allister, who opposes the St Andrews agreement. </p> <p>Sinn F\u00e9in too have their own fears and concerns as they face charges from their republican critics that the power-sharing deal is securing partition rather than undermining it. If they can't even deliver an Irish language, the dissidents argue, how can Sinn F\u00e9in use a parliament that still flies the union flag to drive Northern Ireland towards fusion with the Irish Republic?</p> <p>Both governments are steeling themselves for a showdown between the main parties in early September. One of the first major decisions will be taken in the first or second week of next month when Campbell rules on the Maze's future. If, as is highly likely, he comes out against the former prison as the site of a \"national\" stadium, this will trigger the first of at least three major rows between the Big Two. </p> <p>The mother of all DUP-Sinn F\u00e9in battles to come remains the policing and justice question. According to reliable sources Peter Robinson and his team met a senior delegation of Ulster Unionists at Westminster last week during which the first minister spoke in rather hardline, belligerent terms about the issue. </p> <p>He, and indeed Gerry Adams (who has also hardened his rhetoric over what he regards as DUP intransigence) could be bluffing. Both parties enjoy the limited power they exercise and in all likelihood know that it is the only show the British and Irish governments will tolerate. </p> <p>But, like politicians and economists accused of talking their countries into a recession, the two parties are in danger of sleepwalking Northern Ireland into another crisis - which would only add to the woes of a population already enduring the miseries of the credit crunch, rising food and fuel bills, and a rain-sodden, damp-soaked summer.</p>",
  "<p>The commonest recurring story attached to this massively overreported credit crunch is that restaurants are suffering because cash-strapped diners are choosing to eat at home. I'm not sure where the statistical backing for this supposition comes from. I somehow imagine combat-trained researchers swinging through sitting room windows on ropes and interrogating couples with a forkful of chicken tikka masala frozen between plate and lip: \"Would you rather be eating out?\"</p> <p>Well actually, yes. For the record, I'd always rather be eating out and, for as long as I can remember, being skint has been the reason, on any given evening, that I'm not.</p> <p>There is an inherent assumption that restaurants are just a more expensive place to have your tea - an absurd notion. Restaurants today are a 'fully rounded hospitality experience' so, if we we're to replicate it while staying at home, we need to do some work. Here, then, is a handy guide to eating out at home.<br><br>Preparation (three weeks in advance): No matter how early you call yourself to book, the only available table will be at 6.30 or 10.30. Look, I know you're the only customers but that makes no difference at all. Do you think the Wolsey turn you down for an 8.30 two-top because they're full? Don't be ridiculous; it's because you are a nonentity and they might need those tables for people who aren't. Remember this at all times while taking your own booking in order to maintain the correct levels of hauteur and fear while talking to yourself. </p> <p><em>During your meal be sure to do at least four of the following: </em></p> <p>1. When you enter your dining room stand nervously waiting until you can show yourself to your table. Be sure to make clear that you don't actually like the table you've selected then assure yourself that it's the only one available on such a busy night before accepting it - ungraciously. The main advantage of your own dining room is that you always get the best table \u2026 and the worst.</p> <p>2. Ask yourself for tap water. Try to sell yourself sparkling water flown in from Fiji. Refuse, then charge yourself grumpily for the use of a jug.</p> <p>3. Try to place your napkin in your own lap in a way that's embarrassingly intimate. Yes, I know it's hard to invade your own space but work with me here \u2026 you need to feel uncomfortable in a vaguely sexual way. Think about your Nan's pants.</p> <p>4. Think for a really long time before choosing the second cheapest wine you have in the house but be sure to smirk patronisingly at yourself for doing so.</p> <p>5. Ask yourself if 'everything is OK' at 30 second intervals or entirely ignore yourself. Nothing between these two extremes is acceptable for real authenticity. </p> <p>6. In an important restaurant the chef features as a name over the door but he won't be anywhere near the kitchen. This effect should be really easy to replicate in your own home as you almost certainly don't have a celebrity chef in your kitchen either - unless <a href=\"http://www.anagramgenius.com/archive/antony2.html\">Antony Worrall Thompson</a> is living in your bin, in which case contact a competent and discrete pest control company or buy a fierce cat.</p> <p>7. No matter what you're cooking be sure to surprise yourself with amuses-gueule or inter-courses. Create a sort of children's lunchbox with a handful of assorted <a href=\"http://www.haribo.com/planet/sprachauswahl.php\">Haribo</a> sweets, a couple of teaspoons filled with warm marmite, some mini babybel cheese and those sherbert spaceship things. Place them in a carrier bag and dip in between courses with your eyes shut.</p> <p>8. Forget where your own lavatory is. This is important so you can stand in the middle of the room lost, confused and with a full bladder, mouthing the word 'loo?' and raising your eyebrows with increasing urgency at your waiter. Once you've caught your own eye, you are fully at liberty to direct yourself to the bathroom with a humiliating public display of gross arm movements more appropriate to the <a href=\"http://navysite.de/cvn/catcom.htm\">flight deck of an aircraft carrier</a> than a dining room.</p> <p>There are some things of course, we'll never be able to get quite right. Unless, for example, you have a truly objectionable flatmate you're never going to have to overhear the boor at the next table ranting at the top of his plutocratic lungs about how he's just acquired worldwide rights to the letter 'B' and loudly sending back perfectly good wine as corked, but I guess we have to make some sacrifices - after all there is a credit crunch on.</p> <p>I'm sure this kind of thing is going to get more popular as austerity bites so, has anyone got any other suggestions for creating the authentic home restaurant experience?</p>",

  "<p>Britain's best-known pest control business, Rentokil Initial, saw its profits plunge by more than 50% over the first half of the year, casting a shadow over the group's recovery hopes following four profit warnings since December.</p> <p>The group, which once earned the title of \"Royal Rat-catcher\", said that improvements in the business are being slowed by more difficult economic conditions and warned that the current rate of losses would continue for the remainder of the year.</p> <p>Pre-tax profits for the six months to end June plummeted by 55% to \u00a339.3m and the interim dividend has been cut to 0.65p a share, down from 2.13p - a fall of 70%. The firm cited a downturn in pest control in the UK and US as well as deterioration in its parcel delivery, textiles and washroom services as reasons behind the profit fall.</p> <p>The grim results follow a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jul/25/rentokilinitial.profitwarnings\">profit warning last month</a> - their fourth in seven months - which sent shares diving by 30%.</p> <p>The group, whose business ranges from pest control to catering and conferencing, blamed botched acquisitions and \"poorly-executed\" business restructuring.</p> <p>Rentokil's parcel delivery business, City Link, stabilised, although revenue in the first half was still down by 5.8%. Operating profit in the first six months of the year was just \u00a341.7m compared with \u00a3102.8m during the same period last year.</p> <p>City Link plunged into the red in April this year and the company predicted that the business would make a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/apr/21/rentokilinitial\">full year loss</a> of up to \u00a340m.</p> <p>At the end of the first quarter, City Link had overdue debts of \u00a314m. Brown said that this has been halved but there was still more progress to be made. The firm's washroom and Australian operations were also in a similar dire state and there has been little improvement, Rentokil said, although they saw the situation starting to turn around. </p> <p>\"Recovery will take time, UK businesses (are being) slowed by more difficult economic conditions,\" said Alan Brown, who was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/mar/21/rentokilinitial.ici\">parachuted in as chief executive</a> in March alongside two other executives from chemicals group ICI. </p> <p>\"We have made a solid start with strong improvement in customer service over the past four months, but we are on a three to five-year journey to profit recovery. Our underlying strength is that we have generally attractive market positions and our great opportunity is that we have room for improvement almost everywhere.\"</p> <p>Brown said that the biggest focus would be on poor management programmes and improving customer service. The company also hope to make cost savings and improve productivity of workers.</p> <p>\"We're still a profitable business,\" Brown said. \"But the level at the moment is unsatisfactory, our 5% operating margin certainly should be back in the double digits in the long term if we are to fulfil our aspirations.\"</p> <p>In July, the group warned that profits before tax would be \u00a3116m this year - \u00a335m lower than forecast in May. </p> <p>Once one of Britain's most successful companies - with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2006/dec/01/consumernews.currentaccounts\">former boss Sir Clive Thompson</a> dubbed \"Mr 20%\" for his ability to keep the conglomerate growing every year - Rentokil has come under severe pressure this year to break itself up.</p> <p>But Brown maintained that this was not in the best interest of shareholders and insisted the company should be given several years for improvements to be made.</p> <p>Shares in Rentokil slid by 7.75p or 10.5% to 66.75p in early trading today.

Can Reade join them there, we're about to find out...</p> <!-- Block 27 --> <p><strong>3.08am</strong> Reade wins!! Oh yes!! It's 1966 all over again, but better!</p> <!-- Block 28 --> <p><strong>3.09am</strong> Reade's time is the fastest of the women's competition so far. What a battle we're in for when the 19-year-old takes on Chausson in about 30 minutes time</p> <!-- Block 29 --> <p><strong>3.11am</strong> As the men's semi-finals come to a conclusion, Will from Sydney expresses his disbelief at how Kamakaze's medal-challenge has \"gone down in flames\". Do I detect some sarcasm there Will?</p> <!-- Block 30 --> <p><strong>3.15am</strong> Kamakazi is up now....</p> <!-- Block 31 --> <p><strong>3.17am</strong> He finishes a decent fourth, three places behind the imperious Strombergs who comfortably secures his place in the men's final</p> <!-- Block 32 --> <p><strong>3.20am</strong> Look out, its beach volleyball time. Brazil's Ricardo Santos and Emanuel Rego are taking on Georgia's Brazilian pair of Renato Gomes and Jorge Terceiro. It's 19-14 to the Brazilians...Santos and Rego in case you're wondering.</p> <!-- Block 33 --> <p><strong>3.27am</strong> Set point for the current Olympic champions....</p> <!-- Block 34 --> <p><strong>3.28am</strong> Rego smashes it over the net to take the bronze. A bronze in beach volleyball...now that's a c.v winner if ever I've seen one</p> <!-- Block 35 --> <p><strong>3.30am</strong> BMX final time. A win for Reade, the favourite coming into these Games, will change her life forever. She'll become a dame, then be named BBC Sports Personality of the year and, most significantly of all, appear on Superstars with Lee Sharpe. Wow</p> <!-- Block 36 --> <p><strong>3.34am</strong> Reade down! Reade down! No!!!!!!!</p> <!-- Block 37 --> <p><strong>3.35am</strong> Her wheel clipped Chausson's back-wheel as the pair went for the line. She's hurt her arm, shattered our dreams and left Sharpe hanging. Disaster</p> <!-- Block 38 --> <p><strong>3.37am</strong> Got to give credit to Chausson, one top rider. Reade will beat her in 2012 though, definitely. The sand dunes of Stratford WILL be hers.</p> <!-- Block 39 --> <p><strong>3.40am</strong> No time to dwell on what might have been...it's time for the men's final.</p> <!-- Block 40 --> <p><strong>3.44am</strong> No upset; Strombergs wins in 30.190 seconds.</p> <!-- Block 41 --> <p><strong>3.44am</strong> No upset; Strombergs wins in 30.190 seconds.</p> <!-- Block 42 --> <p><strong>3.45am</strong> Stromberg's victory means Latvia has its first ever Olympic gold medal in cycling. They'll be doing wheelies in the streets of Riga tonight</p> <!-- Block 43 --> <p><strong>3.50am</strong> Discus time in the men's decathlon and Clay is looking awesome. He's thrown 53.79m, the longest distance in Olympic decathlon-discus history.</p> <!-- Block 44 --> <p><strong>3.59am</strong> Shanaze Reade says she \"put everything\" into the BMX final, including her \"heart and soul\". She's hurt her arms, legs and back but has vowed to return in four years time. What a legend, what a sport.</p> <!-- Block 45 --> <p><strong>4.02am</strong> The men's beach volleyball final kicks off. Another Brazilian pair are in action; Marcio Araujo and Fabio Magalhaes, and they're taking on Philip Dalhausser and Todd Rogers of the United States.</p> <!-- Block 46 --> <p><strong>4.08am</strong> The Brazilians were storming but the Americans have brought it back to 3-7.</p> <!-- Block 47 --> <p><strong>4.09am</strong> A mix-up on the serve-return, or \"dig\", puts the Brazilians 9-3 up</p> <!-- Block 48 --> <p><strong>4.12am</strong> It's gone quiet on the email front here at Guardian towers. Come on readers, where are ya!</p> <!-- Block 49 --> <p><strong>4.13am</strong> Oh by the way, they're taking a little sit-down in the volleyball. It's 10-9 to the Brazilian team, victory may just make up for the awful performance of the national football team. Or perhaps not.</p> <!-- Block 50 --> <p><strong>4.18am</strong> I do wonder how the track and field athletes react to the beach volleyball guys when they all sit down for dinner in the Olympic Village. <br>\"What did you do today?\"<br>\"Oh I ran 1500 meters in searing heat and breath-sapping humidity. You?\"<br>\"I was on the beach, playing volleyball\"<br>Cue awkward silence</p> <!-- Block 51 --> <p><strong>4.22am</strong> Have to admit, this is actually quite exciting. It's now 17-17. That Dalhausser is huge, A ball-slapping giant. He's apparently 6ft 9ins tall.</p> <!-- Block 52 --> <p><strong>4.27am</strong> Crickey, its set-point USA.....</p> <!-- Block 53 --> <p><strong>4.29am</strong> Dalhausser serves at 21-20 but Fabio pushes it back to make it 21-21. The Americans have dropped two set points and now have to receive serve</p> <!-- Block 54 --> <p><strong>4.30am</strong> They survive, get a third set point and after Fabio can only hit the ball into the net, win the first set. Cracking stuff, honest.</p> <!-- Block 55 --> <p><strong>4.31am</strong> In other Olympic news, Alex Schwazer, from Italy, wins gold in the men's 50km walk and 17-year-old Aaron Cooke, from Manchester, progresses through to the next round of today's taekwondo competition. That continues later</p> <!-- Block 56 --> <p><strong>4.35am</strong> The beach volleyball is underway. It's 5-3 to the Brazilians in the second set. Could this be the sport's very own Federer v Nadal?</p> <!-- Block 57 --> <p><strong>4.37am</strong> Right then, Charlie from typhoon-hit Hong Kong wants to know if the Philippines has even won an Olympic medal. I'm too busy watching my new favourite sport beach volleyball to check so does anyone else know the answer?</p> <!-- Block 58 --> <p><strong>4.41am</strong> This from Pommie Barsteward in Far North Queensland: \"Does any one know what the chances are of the Russians passing us in the medal table? If we finish third it would be great but a fourth would still be creditable. Personally speaking, as long we finish above the Aussies I'll be more than happy.\" I hear that Pommie</p> <!-- Block 59 --> <p><strong>4.42am</strong> Nathan, did your girlfriend watch Christine Ohuruogu win 400m gold on Tuesday? She didn't seem to be sitting down to me.</p> <!-- Block 60 --> <p><strong>4.45am</strong> Another sit-down in the volleyball. They're back and it's 12-10 to the US. You can cut the tension with a plastic spade</p> <!-- Block 61 --> <p><strong>4.49am</strong> Three points in a row brings Brazil back into this. It's 14-14 and the public address DJ is playing Song 2 by Blur. The Olympics do not get better than this</p> <!-- Block 62 --> <p><strong>4.51am</strong> Some great work at the net by Fabio puts Brazil 17-5 up in the second set. A poor return by Dalhausser makes it 18-15 and, not surprisingly, the US guys call a time-out. They're rattled.</p> <!-- Block 63 --> <p><strong>4.55am</strong> Harry has wade into the Britain verses Australia medals debate. \"Surely with a comparable GDP but three times the population of Australia, anything less than three times the medals means Oz wins? I mean apples with apples please,\" he says</p> <!-- Block 64 --> <p><strong>4.56am</strong> Back to the more important battle and Brazil take the second set 21-17. We're going to have a third set to decide who wins gold. What drama</p> <!-- Block 65 --> <p><strong>4.57am</strong> Kevin informs us that \"the Philippines have never won gold, their best is two silvers in boxing.\" Thanks Kevin, sadly I cannot publish your final comment as its ever so slightly offensive.</p> <!-- Block 66 --> <p><strong>5.01am</strong> It's 3-0 to the US in the volleyball</p> <!-- Block 67 --> <p><strong>5.06am</strong> After a shaky display at the end of the previous set, Dalhausser is back to his imperious best. Great serving and even better blocking have seen him and Rogers go 9-2 up in the final set</p> <!-- Block 68 --> <p><strong>5.10am</strong> 14-10 to the US. They're on gold-medal point...</p> <!-- Block 69 --> <p><strong>5.11am</strong> USA WIN BEACH VOLLEYBALL GOLD</p> <!-- Block 70 --> <p><strong>5.12am</strong> A net-block by 'the beast' Dalhausser has given the US their third men's beach volleyball gold and a clean sweep at these games after the American women also took gold. Michael Phelps move-over, there's some new heroes in town</p> <!-- Block 71 --> <p><strong>5.15am</strong> Pommie's fighting back: \"GB has 311 odd athletes in Beijing while Australia has over 482. Does Harry care to work out the medal winning ratio on that basis? Can I hear the sound of a pin dropping?\"</p> <!-- Block 72 --> <p><strong>5.18am</strong> Back to the Birds Nest where Daniel Awde throws 37.12 in the decathlon-discus and with it, moves down to 28th in the placings. Oh dear</p> <!-- Block 73 --> <p><strong>5.20am</strong> Aaron Cooke, our big taekwondo hope, was inspired to take up the sport after watching the Power Rangers. I was inspired to take up not-watching-television after watching the Power Rangers</p> <!-- Block 74 --> <p><strong>5.25am </strong> Having beaten Anju Jason from the Marshall Islands 7-0 earlier on, Cooke will take on Venezuela's Carlos Carvajal Vasquez later</p> <!-- Block 75 --> <p><strong>5.28am</strong> Harry fights back: \"Team GB are at liberty to send 482 competitors if they wish; Australia cannot find another 40 million population to pick from. As an Irish Kiwi I'd like to paraphrase Henry Kissinger and wish you would both lose.\" Game on</p> <!-- Block 76 --> <p><strong>5.32am</strong> And this from Mike: \"Here in Perth it's quite hard to find out exactly what Team GB is winning because the Aussie TV broadcasters DON'T SHOW ANY OF IT. They've given us barely a minute of the track cycling, every Brit's new favourite sport, choosing instead to show anything with the slightest flash of green and gold. Thankfully a medal table is never far away though, which is pretty satisfying.\"</p> <!-- Block 77 --> <p><strong>5.34am</strong> Clearly fired-up by the messages which have been coming into Guardian towers, the Australian women's hockey team has just beaten their British counterparts 2-0. Sadly for the Aussies, there was no medal to play for, instead they finished fifth overall.</p> <!-- Block 78 --> <p><strong>5.47am</strong> Don't forget that Tom Daley and Peter Waterfield are competing in the men's 10m platform preliminary later today.</p> <!-- Block 79 --> <p><strong>5.51am</strong> It's getting spicy in the Britain v Australia medals war of words. This from Pommie: \"If Harry would care to calculate the gold medal totals of Aus, NZ and Ireland and lump them all together he'll find it still doesn't come close to GB. And I'd like to paraphrase that great icon of Irish Australian culture at its best; Paul Hogan as Crocodile Dundee:<br>'You call that an Olympic medal haul? THIS is an Olympic medal haul!'\"</p> <!-- Block 80 --> <p><strong>5.59am</strong> Tim Brabants is also in the canoe later on. Could well be another gold for Team GB, what would the Aussies think of that I wonder...</p> <!-- Block 81 --> <p><strong>6am</strong> The IOC is investigating the possibility that members of China's gold-medal winning gymnastics team are under the age of 16 and therefore ineligible to compete at these Games. It is believed that He Kexin, who won gold on the uneven bars, may only be 14.</p> <!-- Block 82 --> <p><strong>6.01am</strong> Katy Livingstone and Heather Fell are in modern pentathlon action later on too....</p> <!-- Block 83 --> <p><strong>6.06am</strong> No retort as yet from Harry....</p> <!-- Block 84 --> <p><strong>6.16am</strong> Harry's back: \"Golds: GB has 17 and Oz and NZ combined have 14. Pommie may say that 14 is nowhere near 17 but most wouldn't. But the combined populations of the three countries (less than 30 million) are nowhere near the 60 million GB has. Team GB need to be on 28 golds to even equal the efforts of the tri-nations.\" Fact-tastic</p> <!-- Block 85 --> <p><strong>6.22am</strong> Bad news folks; Harry's off. The proud Kiwi has just informed me that he's going for a beer at O'Carrolls in Auckland. But in an attempt to make piece, he added: \"I'll buy Pommiebarsteward one if he cares to join me.\" We wait to see if Pommie takes up the offer....</p> <!-- Block 86 --> <p><strong>6.48am</strong> Pommie has also decided to do a Paul McCartney and let it be: \"Tell Harry that mine's a gin and tonic and I'm happy to call it a draw for the sake of international relations,\" he said. Well ain't that nice</p> <!-- Block 87 --> <p><strong>6.50am</strong> A good point from Steve Spencer: \"Why is the British diver Tom Daley allowed to compete at 14 but not the gymnasts?\" I don't know Steve. In regards to your second question, I don't think alcohol can ever be described as a performance enhancing drug.</p> <!-- Block 88 --> <p><strong>7.09am</strong> Don't worry Catherine, you're not missing anything....</p> <!-- Block 89 --> <p><strong>7.19am</strong> For those suffering from Olympic-event withdrawal symptoms, it's 13-12 to Russia in their indoor volleyball match against the United States. USA lead two sets to one. Apparently it has been decided that if Russia lose this one, they have to get out of Georgia. If America lose, they have to get out of everywhere else</p> <!-- Block 90 --> <p><strong>7.30am</strong> It's now 23-20 to the Russians</p> <!-- Block 91 --> <p><strong>7.33am</strong> it's two-sets all between Russia and the United States. Georgia looks on...</p> <!-- Block 92 --> <p><strong>7.58am</strong> Not since Italia'90 has there been as much excitement about an England v Ireland tussle. James DeGale will shortly take on Darren Sutherland in one of the middleweight boxing semi-finals. The loser is guaranteed a bronze medal but no doubt both fighters will be going for gold. They have met five times before with Sutherland coming out on top on four of those occasions.</p> <!-- Block 93 --> <p><strong>8.02am</strong> This from Max: \"Having listened to the Jamaican national anthem a few times recently - does anybody else think it should be a bit more fun?</p> <!-- Block 94 --> <p><strong>8.04am</strong> USA beat Russia to set up a gold-medal meeting with either Italy or Brazil. Could it be yet another volleyball triumph for the Americans?</p> <!-- Block 95 --> <p><strong>8.07am</strong> Well it's been a fun six hours or so but that's it from me. I'm now handing over to Howard \"the killa\" Swains (sorry, i'm gripped by boxing fever). Enjoy folks.</p> <!-- Block 96 --> <p><strong>8.13am:</strong> Textbook takeover, there. We're slap bang in the middle of the middleweight semi-final boxing between James DeGale and Darren Sutherland. The Brit DeGale leads 3-1 at the end of the second round.</p> <!-- Block 97 --> <p><strong>8.16am:</strong> DeGale is well on top here, and takes a 8-2 lead at the end of the third round. \"It's like the bull and the matador at the moment. All DeGale needs is a cape,\" commentates the commentator, whose name got lost in our seemless transition. A cape on these boxing suits would mean one thing: Superman.</p> <!-- Block 98 --> <p><strong>8.18am: Boxing:</strong> Sutherland's only hope in this last round is a knockout; DeGale leads by far too far. After a massive dressing down during the round break from his corner man Terry Edwards (I'm sure the trumpet player the the Bad Seeds was called Terry Edwards - I'm thinking it's a different one), DeGale knows he just has to keep his cool in this last round to upgrade bronze to silver at least.</p> <!-- Block 99 --> <p><strong>8.20am: Boxing: </strong>DeGale bosses the early stages, then walks on to a hefty one from Sutherland. It rocks the Brit, but he sees out the final 23 seconds to take the bout 10-3. He's through to the final.</p> <!-- Block 100 --> <p><strong>8.22am: Boxing: James DeGale wins middleweight (75kg) semi-final and goes through to final.</strong> That's at least a silver for the Hammersmith Hammer.</p> <!-- Block 101 --> <p><strong>8.24am: Boxing: </strong>\"That's the way he plays. He's a runner. I'm a fighter,\" says sore loser, Darren Sutherland. \"I'm not a sore loser. I hope he goes on a wins gold,\" he adds, at just the right moment. James DeGale gets all excited: \"I just wanna hear my national anthem. I'll cry. I swear.\"</p> <!-- Block 102 --> <p><strong>8.27am: Kayaking:</strong> Yes. It's the good doctor, Tim Brabants in the final of the K1 1,000m, from the lake. Brabants, who really <em>is</em> a doctor, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/20/olympics2008.olympicscanoeingandkayaking\">chatted to Small Talk</a> earlier in the week, and why not take a quick peek at that as they paddle a bit before the big off. You've got two minutes.</p> <!-- Block 103 --> <p><strong>8.31: Kayaking:</strong> Holy canoe. They're off. Brabants flew out of the blocks (or whatever) and leads at the 250m mark from the huge Canadian beside him. The two of them are way ahead of the rest.</p> <!-- Block 104 --> <p><strong>8.32am: Kayaking:</strong> Some terrific rotation from the good doctor, according to Helen Reeves in the commentary box. Who seems to know. Brabants leads at the half-way stage from the big Canadian.</p> <!-- Block 105 --> <p><strong>8.33am: Kayaking:</strong> \"Has Tim gone too soon?\" That's the fear as the defending Olympic champion, a Norwegian called Laursen, comes up on the outside. But no, he hasn't. He's timed it perfectly, and Tim Brabants holds on to take gold. \"That's wonderful paddling,\" wheezes Gary Herbert.</p> <!-- Block 106 --> <p><strong>8.34am: Tim Brabants wins gold for Team GB!GB!GB! in the men's 1,000m K1 kayak</strong></p> <!-- Block 107 --> <p><strong>8.37am: </strong>Wow. Sachin sits here all night and watches our main medal hope eat BMX track dirt; I'm here for ten minutes, and that's a gold and silver. Just call me Midas. Next up, we've surely got a tearful medal ceremony for the good doctor Brabants, then, well, something else. I'll find out. \"Did James DeGale really declare that he trained for four years, and then fought his way to the final of an Olympic boxing tournament because \"I just wanna hear my national anthem\"?\" wonders Will Sinclair. \"Surely there is an easier way? Just buy the CD for God's sake, man!\" Well, he did say other stuff in his interview, but I think that was his main motivation. It is a corker.</p> <!-- Block 108 --> <p><strong>8.40am:</strong> \"Surely James DeGale is a shoo-in for Sports Personality, if the Beeb can take the 'Personality' aspect of the award into account,\" says Andrew Moore. Nigel Mansell, Nick Faldo, Jonny Wilkinson, etc. \"Personality\" has scarcely been necessary, Andrew.</p> <!-- Block 109 --> <p><strong>8.43am:</strong> I don't want this to put you off our newest gold medallist, but the last album Tim Brabants bought was by Coldplay. How do I know this? Because I've just read <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/20/olympics2008.olympicscanoeingandkayaking\">his SmallTalk interview with the good doctor, which you can also do by clicking the blue</a>.</p> <!-- Block 110 --> <p><strong>8.48am:</strong> \"Taekwondo now,\" murmurs Adrian Chiles, twirling a pen and looking sheepish. I can's say I'm up for that, so it's more boxing. It's the other semi-final in the middleweight division on one of these wonderful internet feeds, and it's a Russian versus a Cuban. Oh, actually this is a heavyweight bout, so scrap that.</p> <!-- Block 111 --> <p><strong>8.56am: Taekwondo:</strong> OK, a little bit of Taekwondo. The Beeb is showing a repeat of Aaron Cooke's defeat of Anju Jason earlier in the day. The Brit thrashed him seven to zip, and a seven-point lead is good enough to end any Taekwondo bout, post Athens, as you know. He's into the quarter finals, where he'll fight Carlos Vasquez Carvajal, from Venezuela, for a shot at a medal.</p> <!-- Block 112 --> <p><strong>8.58am:</strong> It's another one of those 9am lulls at the Games, when we get load of repeats, hours of bluster about the British medal tally, and, yep, beach volleyball. Later on, though, everyone's favourite 14-year-old scapegoat Tom Daley dives. This time he's by himself, so he can't ruin everything for everyone else, like he did last time. There's also David Price in the boxing ring, but that's hours away.</p> <!-- Block 113 --> <p><strong>9.02am: Taekwondo</strong> Lull, what lull. Here it is, this is Aaron Cooke in the quarter final of the welterweight taekwondo. And now I'm crazy about it, especially as Cook took a 2-0 lead within the first minute.</p> <!-- Block 114 --> <p><strong>9.03am: Taekwondo:</strong> That's 3-0 to Cook at the end of the first round against the Venezuelan. Apparently the Power Rangers got the young Cook involved with taekwondo.</p> <!-- Block 115 --> <p><strong>9.06am: Taekwondo: </strong>Vasquez picks up his first point, then gets a half-point penalty for stepping onto the yellow outside the ring. But, yowsers, Cook throws what looked to the untrained eye like one hell of a kick that connects with Vasquez's head and gets two points for Cook. He's leading 5-1 at the end of the second round, of three.</p> <!-- Block 116 --> <p><strong>9.09am: Taekwondo: </strong><strong> Aaron Cook </strong>has just kicked his way into the semi-final of the taekwondo and is now guaranteed a fight for the bronze at least. He's a 17-year-old from Manchester, in case you're wondering, and he thrashed that Venezuelan.</p> <!-- Block 117 --> <p><strong>9.13am:</strong> \"In the diving, Tom Daley has it easy, as it's really just jumping into water isn't it?\" You know better than that, Gary Naylor. \"Most other jumping events (long jump, ski jump etc) use length (or length plus style marks) as the criteria for victory, so why not in the pool? Seeing someone charge along the 10 metre platform then jump as far out as possible into the water would be great fun. Style marks could be awarded for tightest bomb or best use of flailing limbs.\" Some day, someone will host this alternative Olympics.</p> <!-- Block 118 --> <p><strong>9.15am:</strong> In case you missed it, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/22/olympics2008.olympicscanoeingandkayaking\">Tim Brabants won gold for GB in this morning's 1,000m K1 kayaking.</a></p> <!-- Block 119 --> <p><strong>9.19am:</strong> \"Here in Hong Kong we're right slap bang in the middle of the eye of Typhoon Nuri,\" says Tim Maitland, in an Olympics-free email, but an email nonetheless. \"It's totally calm. The dragonflies have come out (as has next door's maid). Within half an hour it'll be like Armageddon!\" Feisty one, is she?</p> <!-- Block 120 --> <p><strong>9.24am: </strong>Germany wins gold in the women's K4 500m kayaking, which is one hell of a race. Four people in a boat windmilling in a straight line. Terrific stuff. Meanwhile, Paul Harman is a Brit who lives and works in the Netherlands: I am a Brit who lives and works in the Netherlands,\" he confirms. \"In this Olympic Games the Netherlands team is doing pretty well so far - 15 medals including 6 golds - but the story that they're all rather smugly enjoying is this: \"Belgium Null Points\". Belgium's medal tally so far:<br>Golds: 0<br>Silvers: 0<br>Bronzes: 0<br>Total: 0<br>There's every chance now that Belgium will pull out a big fat duck for the whole Games - Yikes!!\"</p> <!-- Block 121 --> <p><strong>9.29am:</strong> I can't help but advise you to read something other than this at the moment, so how about: <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/22/olympics20083\">The Beijinger: our daily email from the Games.</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/aug/20/olympics2008.olympicscanoeingandkayaking\">Small Talk's paddle with Team GB!GB!GB!'s latest gold medallist Tim Brabants</a><br><a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/22/phelps_is_within_spitzing_dist.html\">Harry Pearson on Michael Phelps</a><br>or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/gallery/2008/aug/22/olympics2008?picture=336856494\">Some loverly pictures</a></p> <!-- Block 122 --> <p><strong>9.40am:</strong> Somewhere in China, Britain's modern pentathletes are into the horsey section of that particular running, swimming, sword-fighting, shooting, riding discipline. Heather Fell was doing pretty well, second after the swim, but there don't seem to be any pictures from this, so who knows how she's going now.</p> <!-- Block 123 --> <p><strong>9.44am: </strong>My fledgling taekwondo knowledge is stretched to its fullest to bring you this: I think there's good news for <strong>Aaron Cook</strong> in that he's due to fight the Italian Mauro Sarmiento in the semi-final. Sarmiento beat the American Steven Lopez in his quarter final, and Lopez is the reigning Olympic champion, who also won gold in Sydney.</p> <!-- Block 124 --> <p><strong>9.55am:</strong> Some facts about our latest Olympic hero Aaron Cook, who has a semi-final fight in the taekwondo later on. He was the Cadet European Champion in 2005, won bronze at the world junior Games in 2006, then won gold this year. <a href=\"http://www.olympics.org.uk/beijing2008/AthleteProfile.aspx?id=6443\">It's all here if you want to read it.</a></p> <!-- Block 125 --> <p><strong>9.57am:</strong> \"When it comes to the alternative Olympics,\" says Tom Miles, as if continuing a discussion we had in the pub last night. \"I am rather hoping to see a no-holds barred attempt to beat all the records at the conventional games \u2013 that man with the carbon fibre legs versus [name removed by spineless reporter fearful of Guardian legal department] and his/her cocktail of drugs, perhaps competing against someone who has been genetically modified with cheetah implants and someone else with prototype Wallace n Gromit rocket legs that may or may not explode on the start line. Original, guaranteed records and \u2013 best of all- no one could cheat. Wouldn't that be more fun?\" It certainly would be more fun that what's happening at the moment, which is some table-tennis, some taekwondo, some kayak medal ceremonies, and eff all else.</p> <!-- Block 126 --> <p><strong>10.03am:</strong> Joanne Harris has lifted some of this mid-morning gloom: \"Kia ora from New Zealand,\" she begins, which sends me scuttling off to Wikipedia and the knowledge that everyone's favourite source of childhood hyperactivity and e-numbers is actually a Maori greeting meaning 'Be well and healthy'. \"Regarding the taekwondo, does Cook get a bronze regardless because he made the semis (like the boxers)?\" No, he doesn't unfortunately. He gets to fight for a spot in the final, where it's gold or silver, and if he loses, he gets to fight the other defeated semi-finallists for the one bronze medal. I'm not sure how come the surfeit of bronze medals doesn't extend from the boxing hall to the taekwondo hall, but I don't make the rules.</p> <!-- Block 127 --> <p><strong>10.07am:</strong> Martyn Kingsbury has been firewalled: \"Why when I was just looking forward to sitting down and <a href=\"http://www.olympics.org.uk/beijing2008/AthleteProfile.aspx?id=6443#\">reading your blog about Aaron Cook</a> did you decide to supply it on a web page that my company feels is an un-acceptable address?\" No idea, Martyn, but it'll probably surprise you to learn that it wasn't even a blog. It was just the Team GB!GB!GB! website and unless your company blocks wanton jingoism or unseemly pictures of Sir Clive Woodward, there's nothing on there to worry about.</p> <!-- Block 128 --> <p><strong>10.13am: Modern pentathlon: </strong> Right, finally there's a feed to the modern pentathlon, where Britain's <strong>Heather Fell</strong> was in second place after the third-of-five-events, the swimming. It's the show jumping section now, where Fell has apparently picked a real old nag to ride (not her fault - there's a lottery for what horse you get). This is a first for all of us, I expect. But it's show-jumping all the way from here.</p> <!-- Block 129 --> <p><strong>10.19am: Modern pentathlon: </strong> OK, show-jumping then. Show-jumping. In the words of minute-by-minute heavyweight Scott Murray: \"Has it really come to this?\" Belinda Schreiber, from Switzerland, is off at the moment, on a horse called GuangGuang. \"I'm going to take a wild prediction,\" says the commentator. \"Go on then,\" says the other one. \"This is going to be dreadful.\" Good-o.</p> <!-- Block 130 --> <p><strong>10.23am:</strong> Schreiber \"loses her right stirrup\" and I lose my internet connection. Then I get back online and they've lost a horse in the show jumping arena, where really no one seems to have a clue what's going on, which makes me feel very comfortable. Schreiber's ride was actually pretty good, apparently, although I'm not sure what that means in the overall standings. Rest assured, this shambles will get sorted out soon. Or not.</p> <!-- Block 131 --> <p><strong>10.28am: Modern pentathlon: </strong>Jane Marques, from Brazil, loses her <em>left</em> stirrup, but still completes the course. She was sixth overall before that ride, but will drop down. The Ukrainian Tereshuk is out next, and she was fifth overall before this, which leads me to believe that they may be coming out in order. That means Fell will be out soon-ish.</p> <!-- Block 132 --> <p><strong>10.30am: Taikwondo: </strong>Joshua Nealon wants to know \"Why is it a GOOD thing that our boy Aaron Cook has to fight a guy who just beat the crap out of the reigning double Olympic champion? Surely the Italian Sarmiento is going to be hard as nails, no???\" We'll find out right now. The bout has started.</p> <!-- Block 133 --> <p><strong>10.32am:</strong> This, ladies and gentleman, is versatility. Aaron Cook is currently fighting Sarmiento in the taekwondo semi-final, and the modern pentathletes are currently show-jumping. I'm trying to cover both. At the end of the first round in the taekwondo, Cook is 2-1 down to the Italian, but can count himself unlucky. He should have had a point, it seemed, near to the end of the round, but it wasn't given.</p> <!-- Block 134 --> <p><strong>10.34am: Taekwondo and modern pentathlon:</strong> Kick, point. Kick back, point. Kick from the Brit. Point! Two-one in that round of the taekwondo, meaning it's 3-3 with one round left. Heather Fell is now out in the modern pentathlon show-jumping and she's going great guns as well. In fact, hold the back page, she only hits two fences, which is brilliant, and she moves into gold medal position!</p> <!-- Block 135 --> <p><strong>10.37am: Taekwondo and modern pentathlon:</strong> Only a German and a horse called ZhingZhing stands between Heather Fell and the first place after the show-jumping. In the taekwondo, both fighters score two points, bringing it to 5-5 but -- disaster! -- in the final second, Sarmiento gets a kick in and takes it 6-5. Cook is in tears.</p> <!-- Block 136 --> <p><strong>10.39am:</strong> Huge disappointment for <strong>Aaron Cook</strong>, who will now fight for the bronze medal only after that last-second point for Sarmiento in the taekwondo. Better news in the modern pentathlon, where <strong>Heather Fell</strong> will start the final, medal-deciding 3,000m run in second place.</p> <!-- Block 137 --> <p><strong>10.45am:</strong> The way this modern pentathlon works, and which I've known all along, of course, is that you get a whole load of points for the first four events, which are tabulated and then decide who starts in what order, and by how many seconds, in the final 3,000m run. Heather Fell, who is a very strong runner, will start 19 seconds behind Lena Schoneborn, of Germany, when they go off later today. She has genuine chances of a medal. Not that man-of-the-people Gary Naylor would be impressed: \"Modern Pentathlon comprises fencing, shooting, swimming, show jumping, and cross-country running. So it's pretty much a competition about being posh. No wonder the Brits do well in it. Replace the swimming and running with \"getting your child into the right prep school\" and \"4x4 urban driving\" and we'd win the gold in perpetuity.\"</p> <!-- Block 138 --> <p><strong>10.49am:</strong> OK folks, Scott Murray's here to take you through to the end of the day. Thanks for your emails, sorry I couldn't use most of them, but keep them coming. Scott's on <a href=\"mailto:scott.murray@theguardian.com\">scott.murray@theguardian.com</a></p> <!-- Block 139 --> <p><strong>10.55am:</strong> Good morning to you, and what's going on here, then. Ah yes, it's the semi-final of the volleyball. I thought the USA had won gold in this earlier on today, but by all accounts that's a completely different sport as it was played on the beach and there were less people involved. This is the semi-final of the men's indoor event between the USA and Russia, and at the moment the Russians are treating the ball with the sort of disdain they are currently showing Nato, hammering it around with their fists like billy-o. It's 7-7 in the final set. Is that what you say? Bump, set, spike, bump, set, spike.</p> <!-- Block 140 --> <p><strong>11.03am:</strong> Now it's 12-12. Oh me, oh my. Now then, I have no idea what any of you have been talking about, so this will either be a seamless segue or, more likely, a clunking left-turn way off piste, but here goes. \"I find it a bit rich Sir Clive Woodward taking on the lead role for elite performance,\" opines Colin Huxtable, apoplectic that nobody at the BOA appears to know what has happened to Southampton FC in the last couple of years. \"I found myself imbibing a mojito or two beside him in Antigua last year during the Cricket World Cup and I think its fair to say the man is not averse to the odd pie or fifteen. I just hope he isn't advocating his own dietary regime to our elite athletes.\"</p> <!-- Block 141 --> <p><strong>11.08am:</strong> Ah the States have won it. I would tell you the score in the final set - 15-something - but the BBC left the event as the Americans cavorted with indecent haste, almost as if they couldn't care less about it. Imagine. In other news, that drug-addled Ukranian has been stripped of her silver in the heptathlon.</p> <!-- Block 142 --> <p><strong>11.15am:</strong> \"What's the deal Scott?\" asks Claire Gordon. I'm sensing rancour. \"Howard says the lead is 19 secs, your rival at the BBC says 9 secs.\" What lead? Er... eh... ah, that one. OK, I think Schoneborn's lead over Fell is <em>[MBM reporter logs onto BBC website - they're not <strong>my</strong> rivals, I pay my licence fee]</em> nine seconds. No, it actually is 19 seconds, that's what Howard told me. Do you miss Howard? I miss Howard too.</p> <!-- Block 143 --> <p><strong>Class War with theguardian.com/sport and Gary Naylor:</strong> What's Naylor been saying about the modern pentathlon? Nayyyyloooorrrrr!!! \"Modern Pentathlon is based upon the skills of 19th century British soldiers,\" replies Hong Kong Charlie. \"In other words, shooting, sword fighting / fencing, swimming, horse riding and running. Had Naylor not attended such a scummy comprehensive where the students pierce each other's council flats, you might have known that.\" Eh? What the hell are you talking about? \"Is it just me or do some people think every sport is 'posh'?\" adds Charlie Howard. \"Since when were swimming and running elitist, and does the art of shooting people really qualify you as a toff? Maybe they should have an anti-posh equivalent of the modern pentathlon? Comprising stabbing, boxing, running (away from police cars), talking like Darren Campbell, and hunt sabotaging.\" Great idea. Though maybe we could replace a couple of your events with Wresting The Means Of Production From The Bourgeoisie and Putting People Called Charlie First Up Against The Wall Come The Revolution.</p> <!-- Block 144 --> <p><strong>11.27pm:</strong> The last event of the modern pentathlon - a modern pentathlon for everyone, people, let's pull together, first class for all - will commence at roughly 1pm UK time.</p> <!-- Block 145 --> <p><strong>Thank you, my theguardian.com/sport!</strong> \"Fantastic effort with the volleyball, Scott,\" writes Xan Perez Perez. Thanks, Xan. \"Shame that it came a bit late. BBC MBM coverage gave us the USA-Russia volleyball result at 7.54am. You are just three hours and a half late.\" It's part of our ersatz charm. Anyway, I blame the BBC for not putting one of those \"live\" flashes in the corner of their screen. Stiffed by The Man! Naylor won't like this. That's it, I'm turning to Eurosport.</p> <!-- Block 146 --> <p><strong>11.34pm:</strong> What's this on Eurosport? It's live, I can tell you that for nothing. A channel for the people. I'm not sure what this is. A load of Europeans are on an indoor court throwing a ball about into nets. It's like water polo without the water and extreme violence. I think it might be called Throwing Game.</p> <!-- Block 147 --> <p><strong>11.35pm:</strong> Throwing Game is in fact called Handball. And France are 12-11 up with a minute of the \"first\" remaining.</p> <!-- Block 148 --> <p><strong>11.36pm:</strong> Croatia have just missed a penalty in Throwing Game. What happens is, their best Throwing Man makes to throw the ball at the keeper's face a couple of times, like a schoolground bully, then tries to bounce it off the floor and under Keeps as he makes a star jump. It's a clever move to get past the netminder, but sadly when the ball springs back off the floor, it brushes the underside of the French keeper's front tail and somehow spins onto the bar. Keeper claws it away, shouts a lot, and it's 12-11 at half time to France. Knocks John Terry v Edwin van der Sar into a cocked hat. Actually, no it doesn't. Where's the state broadcaster?</p> <!-- Block 149 --> <p><strong>11.43am</strong> We're in a lull, folks. Alright, I'm in a lull. The BBC are currently broadcasting a montage of modern pentathletes being flung over fences made of polystyrene bricks by their horses. It's like a cross between You've Been Framed and It's A Knockout. So, It's A Knockout, then. \"I've always liked the fact that the Modern Pentathlon - a test of a soldier's skills - puts the run last, tacitly acknowledging that after an almighty scrap the best option is to peg it,\" writes Simon Thomas. \"If this was the Daily Mail MBM, I'd stick in a gag about the Italians dominating the event but we're above that.\" We're above something at last! It's only taken the best part of a decade.</p> <!-- Block 150 --> <p><strong>Class War with theguardian.com/sport and Gary Naylor:</strong> \"Hong Kong Charlie is right about the Modern Pentathlon being based on the skills of a 19th century British soldier - an officer,\" writes Naylor (<a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Karl_Marx.jpg\">pictured here</a>). \"If it were based on the life of a squaddie, it would comprise: being shouted at; forcing pay out of reluctant quartermasters; getting by on half-rations; wearing cheap, unsuitable clothing; and not sharing in the proceeds of Empire.\"</p> <!-- Block 151 --> <p><strong>11.50 am</strong> The handball has started again. I don't even know if this is the semi-final, the final, or what. I should really find out for you, shouldn't I. Give me a sec. (It's now 13-13 after two minutes of the second period, by the way. Croatia must have had the mother of all rollockings at the break.)</p> <!-- Block 152 --> <p><strong>11.52 am</strong> It's the semi-final, and Bertrand Gille has just thrown one in! Yes, he has thrown it in. France go 14-13 up with that stunner, though I have to admit I am struggling to either understand or become animated about this. The only other option is watching the modern pentathletes gad around on their horses again, but Howard's already covered that, so what's left?</p> <!-- Block 153 --> <p><strong>Midday brawl:</strong> It's 16-16 in Throwing Game now, but to hell with that, because Paddy Barnes of Ireland has started flinging his fists around in the aggressive manner; it's the semi-final of the light-flyweight discipline. The 21-year-old is guaranteed a bronze... but can he make the final? The first round doesn't go too well, as he's hit upside his head twice by China's Zou Shiming to go 2-0 down.</p> <!-- Block 154 --> <p><strong>12.05pm:</strong> This is a bit of a rout. Zou is 6-0 up. Barnes has failed to land a single punch in nearly two rounds of boxing. And he's slapped about another couple of times before the bell; that's 8-0. Oh dear.</p> <!-- Block 155 --> <p><strong>12.10pm:</strong> This is a shafting alright - it's now 11-0 after the third - though the judges aren't even bothering to hide their obvious bias for the host competitor. Admittedly Barnes should be about five or six points down, but he has now landed a couple of punches which have not been recorded, while Zou just picked one up for wiping his armpit across the back of Barnes's neck. It's a bit of a farce, really, and it needn't even be like that.</p> <!-- Block 156 --> <p><strong>12.15pm:</strong> Zou was very impressive and a deserved winner, but there was no way that was a 15-0 scoreline. Barnes doesn't look best pleased with the judges - as he walks out of the arena, one official puts a hand on his shoulder and is told in no uncertain terms to do one - and no wonder. Still, he takes a bronze home with him.</p> <!-- Block 157 --> <p><strong>12.18pm:</strong> Barnes has just given a post-bout interview as unequivocal as they come.</p> <p>A LIVID BARNES: \"There's no question I lost the fight, but the judges were a disgrace. They should be docked points ... this is the worst country in the world, they shouldn't even be hosting the Games.\"<br>CRAVEN BBC INTERVIEWER GARY RICHARDSON, AUDIBLY SHAKING AT THE PROSPECT OF GETTING HIS PRESS PASS TAKEN AWAY FROM HIM, AND DOING HIS BEST TO LOSE THE NEWS: <em>(cheerily)</em> \"Well, you won a medal at least!\"<br>BARNES: \"I don't care. They can keep it for all I care.\"</p> <p>[exeunt BARNES and RICHARDSON'S CREDIBILITY]</p> <!-- Block 158 --> <p><strong>12.25pm:</strong> France are in the final of Throwing Game, they must be, they're 25-22 up with less than a minute to go. I'll be going to Tom Daley at the 10m platform diving in a minute, but let's face it he's not going to win. Anyway, at his age he should be bombing and getting shouted at by the lifeguard for heavy petting.</p> <!-- Block 159 --> <p><strong>12.28pm:</strong> And that's it. Croatia pull a goal, if that's what it's called, back, but France prevail 25-23 and will face either Spain or Iceland in Throwing Game Denouement Game.</p> <!-- Block 160 --> <p><strong>12.33pm:</strong> Daley is struggling in the diving; he doesn't look like qualifying in the top 18. He's 23rd at present, after the first round. Jade Johnson has started the long jump final and posted 6.51m with her first jump, but she's got a long way to go if she wants to beat Maggi of Brazil, who has opened with 7.04m. \"In the midst of all this mesmerising and frankly disconcerting British success it's good to see that some traditions remain,\" writes Steve Johnson. \"Reading the Taekwondo updates on this very site I was struck by just how very British Aaron Cook is: decent, gutsy performance. Done by a dodgy ref. Defeated in heart-breaking fashion right at the death. All he has to do now is repeat it in the bronze medal bout to finish fourth after being within a whisker of fighting for the gold and THAT is British sporting endeavour at its finest.\"</p> <!-- Block 161 --> <p><strong>12.40pm:</strong> The semi-final of the women's 4x400m is off. The British team were miles in front after Nicola Saunders' first leg, and now it's Kelly Sotherton. Oh dear.</p> <!-- Block 162 --> <p><strong>12.42pm:</strong> There's a minor panic at the end of the race. Christine Ohuruogu ambles round and is nearly pipped for third place by the German runner. She puts in a spurt right at the end to ensure qualification for the final, but that was dicing with death; Britain were a hair's breadth from going out there. That wasn't a very clever run, but at least she remembered to turn up for the race.</p> <!-- Block 163 --> <p><strong>12.46pm:</strong> Aaron Cook has just started his bid for bronze in Kicking Game. His Chinese opponent Zhu Guo gives him a boot up the jacksie to go one up, but Cooke responds by walloping him upside his head. That should have been two points but... you know the way this is going. Let's hope Gary Richardson isn't doing the post-bout interview.</p> <!-- Block 164 --> <p><strong>12.49pm:</strong> Cook is now on -1 points after conceding a couple of minor penalty scores for... there really is no point me trying to wing it, this is simply the way it is. Zhu is three ahead, on two points himself.</p> <!-- Block 165 --> <p><strong>12.52pm:</strong> A wee bit of a comeback from Cook; after a flurry of Way of the Exploding Fist style hoofing, it's now 3-1 to Zhu. Ah no, hold on, it's 4-1. I have no idea what is going on. Other than it's all over, and Zhu has the bronze medal. I get the impression we're in a Paddy Barnes situation here; Zhu was the better fighter - he certainly <em>looked</em> the more adroit, though as I say I know nowt - but Cook didn't get much out of the judges there.</p> <!-- Block 166 --> <p><strong>12.58pm:</strong> Brazil are currently beating Belgium 2-0 in the bronze medal football match; it's half-time there. Anyway, everyone, time to put your Jingohats on - it's the final discipline in the Modern Pentathlon, the 3,000m. Fell sets off 19 seconds behind Schoneborn, Katy Livingston a full minute behind her.</p> <!-- Block 167 --> <p><strong>1.04pm:</strong> Fell has picked up a whopping one second over the first 1,000m of her strongest event. Get a wriggle on, you won't be able to blame the judges for this.</p> <!-- Block 168 --> <p><strong>1.07pm:</strong> After the second 1,000m, Fell has closed to within 11 seconds. That poor first lap could cost her, a strong finish is what's needed here...</p> <!-- Block 169 --> <p><strong>1.09pm:</strong> Schoneborn doesn't look like letting this slip, to be honest with you.</p> <!-- Block 170 --> <p><strong>1.10pm:</strong> And she doesn't. Fell takes silver, about 14 seconds behind Schoneborn. Nobody looks particularly excited about this, I have to say. None of them. A very low-key denouement after all that effort.</p> <!-- Block 171 --> <p><strong>1.13pm:</strong> Hold on, Fell has cracked a smile.</p> <!-- Block 172 --> <p><strong>1.15pm:</strong> Actually, she's properly happy now. Took a while, though.</p> <!-- Block 173 --> <p><strong>It's 12.18pm all over again:</strong> This time Aaron Cook has just given a post-bout interview as unequivocal as they come. \"I knew the crowd were going to be on his side, but the judges?\" he says, struggling and ultimately failing to hold back the tears. \"I've never known anything like it, I've never known scoring like it. I was making hits but nothing was going up. What do i have to do to score a point?\" And of course the BBC interviewer doesn't bother to press the point, suggesting \"ah well, at least you have a few lessons learned for 2012\".</p> <!-- Block 174 --> <p><strong>1.20pm:</strong> And with the news that Paddy Barnes is still on the meltdown - he has called for the boxing judges to be dope-tested - I'll take my leave and hand you back to Howard Swains (<a href=\"mailto:hswains@gmail.com\">hswains@gmail.com</a>). Thanks for all your emails, especially the ones about class war (no offence, Ms Fell).</p> <!-- Block 175 --> <p><strong>1.23pm:</strong> Hello again, and welcome to the end of the day, although I'm not really sure what I'm going to be describing to you: I kind of thought this was getting close to the end and that Scott was all over it anyway. It seems not.</p> <p>Actually, it looks like there's still some <strong>boxing</strong> to to get to grips with, with the big Price fella up in the monumental-weight division. And here's some relaying to kick off with, and those buttered batons.</p> <!-- Block 176 --> <p><strong>1.25pm: Athletics:</strong> This is the 4x400m relay and Great Britain are actually doing pretty well after three legs. They're leading, in fact, as Martyn Rooney takes over.</p> <!-- Block 177 --> <p><strong>1.26pm: Athletics:</strong> Remarkably comfortable run there from Martyn Rooney on the anchor leg and Great Britain coast into the final with a victory in the semi-finals. Jamaica and the Bahamas are second and third.</p> <!-- Block 178 --> <p><strong>1.29pm: Athletics:</strong> Dang, long jump too. Great Britain's Jade Johnson is first on my screen, although it's her second leap. She goes sailing 6.64m, and the commentator's hyperbole raises my spirits for a moment before they come crashing back down with the \"That'll keep her in seventh place\" kicker.</p> <!-- Block 179 --> <p><strong>1.33pm: </strong>\"I like all this throwing game/ kicking game stuff,\" says Richard Hamblin. That's Scott Murray for you, Richard. He's a wordsmith. \"Can we extend it? Sort of \"chasing each other round on bikes game\", \"synchronised baton dropping game\", \"cheated out of it by ridiculous homers game\" type of thing.\" Right now, there's the Patronising Scarlet-Haired Triple Jumpers game going on, as Colin Jackson attempts to console Phillips Idowu on his silver-medal-winning, letting-the-whole-country-down-failure for Britain yesterday. \"It's going in one ear and out the other,\" says Phillips, to earn all our envy.</p> <!-- Block 180 --> <p><strong>1.36pm:</strong> I've been in Oslo for about 10 years, and still can't get excited about throwing,\" says Marc Stevens. \"But I caught the last few minutes of yesterday's semi-final match between Norway and South Korea with the South Koreans refusing to acknowledge the last Norwegian goal and lodging an official complaint. <a href=\"http://www1.nrk.no/nett-tv/ol/spill/verdi/68843\">Brief highlights of the chaotic drama with Norwegian commentary here</a>.\" It's the Norwegian commentary that sold it.</p> <!-- Block 181 --> <p><strong>1.37pm: Blonde woman in tears alert: </strong>Sweden and end of television show montage's Carolina Kluft can only manage 6.42m in her third \"long\" jump and so is out of the competition.</p> <!-- Block 182 --> <p><strong>1.41pm: Athletics and Naylor: </strong>The <strong>women's 5,000m final</strong> is under-way in the Bird's Nest. And the women's <strong>hockey</strong> final between China and Holland is also off. \"I can't really Carolina Kl\u00fcft's reasoning in sitting out the heptathlon in favour of the long jump,\" writes Gary Naylor. \"She's gone from being the greatest female athlete in the world to an also-ran, when she could have had a well earned break.\" Be fair, Gary: she also failed in the triple jump.</p> <!-- Block 183 --> <p><strong>1.46pm: Football: </strong>Brazil are 2-0 up against Belgium in the bronze medal football match, which just sounds wrong anyway. It also keeps up Belgium's fine blank in the medal table at these Games.</p> <!-- Block 184 --> <p><strong>1.49pm: Football: </strong>Manchester City's Jo has just scored a third goal in the football, spanking home from the edge of the box, his second of the match, to wrap up the bronze. Certain career-threatening injury surely follows once he starts up front for City, so it must feel good to end his career on a high.</p> <!-- Block 185 --> <p><strong>1.52pm:</strong> Nil-nil in the hockey, Brazil have \"won\" the football (bronze medal) and Lilia Shobukhova leads with 1,000m left in the 5,000m race.</p> <!-- Block 186 --> <p><strong>1.55pm: </strong>The Turkish runner Alemitu Bekele takes to the lead with 800m left.</p> <!-- Block 187 --> <p><strong>1.58pm: Athletics:</strong> Great finish in the 5,000m as the Ethyopian Tirunesh Dibaba streaks clear of Elvan Abeylegesse in the final lap to add 5,000m gold to her 10,000m triumph. An epic double, to be sure.</p> <!-- Block 188 --> <p><strong>2pm: </strong>A shoddy time of 15 minutes 41 seconds for Dibaba in the 5,000m, which is way outside her personal best, I'm told. <strong>Jade Johnson</strong> oversteps on her final long jump, and came something like seventh overall.</p> <!-- Block 189 --> <p><strong>2.03pm:</strong> The women's long jump gets kind of tight at the end, as the Russian Tatyana Lebedeva, sporting a Kevin Pieterson-esque skunk-style hair flash (observation (c) Gary Naylor) leaps 7.03m with the last jump of the competition. It's <em>that</em> close (where <em>that</em> equals 1cm) shorter than the Brazilian Maurren Higa Maggi's leap from earlier, and the Brazilian clings on for gold.</p> <!-- Block 190 --> <p><strong>2.08pm: </strong>\"COVER THE HANDBALL!\" bellows Rachael Lorna Baruchello from the north of Iceland, so loud the windows shook in Farringdon. \"Going to be a national holiday here if Iceland make the final. They come out blazing, going 5-0 up in the first five minutes against Spain (that is a lot); Spain at one point caught up, but Iceland are 17-15 and about to start the second half.\" Do you really need me to cover it, Rachael? You seem to have it pretty well under control. And to understand what in His name is going on, which is more that I can boast.</p> <!-- Block 191 --> <p><strong>2.12pm: Athletics: </strong> It's the final of the women's 4x100m relay, in which Britain's women have already upstaged the men by being able to pass a piece of metal to each other three times in a generous-enough allocation of track. The Jamaicans are red hot favourites for gold here, with the world record under threat.</p> <!-- Block 192 --> <p><strong>2.14pm: </strong>Boxing: And Ireland's Kenny Egan is in the ring on the other channel. Hold on, this running shouldn't take long.</p> <!-- Block 193 --> <p><strong>2.16pm: Pantomine relaying: </strong> And the It's A Knockout relay runners are out again! Great Britain drop the baton, clang. Jamaica drop the baton, clang. Russia get the gold; Nigeria get the bronze but -- get this -- BELGIUM! get the silver.</p> <!-- Block 194 --> <p><strong>2.19pm: Athletics: </strong>OK, forgive me, Great Britain's sprint relay team. They didn't drop the baton. Instead, Montell Douglas couldn't find the hand of Emily Freeman, who had sprinted off way too early. \"I don't know what happened,\" said Freeman.</p> <!-- Block 195 --> <p><strong>2.22pm: Boxing: </strong> OK, the less said about the relay, the better, so it's over to the boxing ring, where Ireland's Kenny Egan is thumping Britain's Tony Jeffries bang upside the head and leading 8-1 at the end of the third round. It's a proper pummelling.</p> <!-- Block 196 --> <p><strong>2.25pm: Boxing: </strong><strong>Great Britain's Tony Jeffries WINS! a bronze medal in the heavyweight boxing</strong>. That's WINS! in the sense that he gets utterly thumped 10-3 by Kenny Egan, who goes through to the final to box for gold.</p> <!-- Block 197 --> <p><strong>2.35pm: Pedantry and inaccuracy:</strong> Thanks to all 11* of you who noticed that Montell Williams is actually an American chat-show host and that Montell Douglas was the British sprinter involved in the relay pantomime at the Olympics moments ago. Meanwhile, Elizabeth Connor has got her knickers in a twist about the jonny-come-latelys to the Olympics and has lost all track of her capitalisation: \"don't get me wrong I love the Olympics nothing quite beats watching obscure sports were you're not entirely sure what's going on at 3am. but it does mean that every numpty who usually loathes supports and thinks I'm a real saddo for always knowing the cricket score (the notable exception being our noble Chief Exec who relies on me for the score) is suddenly is an expert on sport and expressing inane and inaccurate opinions as if they're fact - no possibility that the 2012 games can be for sport enthusiasts only?\" Don't knock the expression of inane and inaccurate opinions as if they're fact, Elizabeth. Some of us depend on that to feed our families.</p> <p>*ten more than actually emailed.</p> <!-- Block 198 --> <p><strong>2.41pm:</strong> After seeing off Australia, the nation's fear-fed antipathy has shifted towards Russia, who have now sneaked up to within one gold of Great Britain in the medals table, thanks to their ability to hold onto baton better than any of us lot, and to swim, shoot, swordfight, ride a horse and run better than us. \"Phillips, Shanzne and now Tony. Don't they realise we NEED those golds. Russia is now only one behind us in the table,\" says James Andrews, representatively.</p> <!-- Block 199 --> <p><strong>2.44pm:</strong> Holland are 2-0 up in the final of the women's hockey with six minutes left. Lightning \"Usain\" Bolt is up in the Bird's Nest soon in the men's 100m relay final.</p> <!-- Block 200 --> <p><strong>2.52pm: </strong> Back to the Worker's Gymnasium for more pugilism. It's David Price, the 6ft 8in super heavyweight, fighting the hot favourite Roberto Cammarelle from Italy. And it's not great for Price in the first round. He lost it 5-0.</p> <!-- Block 201 --> <p><strong>2.57pm: Boxing: Team GB!GB!GB!'s David Price WINS! bronze in the men's super heavyweight division</strong> - and by WINS! I mean has seven-bells knocked out of him by the Italian Roberto Cammarelle in the semi-final, forcing the referee to stop the contest in the second round with the Italian 9-0 up and Price seeing constellations.</p> <!-- Block 202 --> <p><strong>3.05pm: </strong> In the diving, both the pipsqueak Tom Daley and the old-timer Pete Waterfield have qualified for the final of the men's 10m highboard. Daley was 11th, Waterfield is an outside medal chance, qualifying in fourth. Meanwhile Sean Ingle <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/sport/2008/08/22/irish_walker_costin_crosses_th.html\">not only reckons that walking is a sport, he's staked his blogger's reputation on it</a>.</p> <!-- Block 203 --> <p><strong>3.06pm: </strong>Bryan Clay of the United States coasts home in the final event of the decathlon. He could practically have run the 1500m backwards to win it, such was his lead. Full tallies are being calculated, but Clay was miles ahead. Meanwhile -- and get down to the staff canteen to watch it on telly if you want to Amir Jones -- the men's 4x100m relay teams are on the track.</p> <!-- Block 204 --> <p><strong>3.09pm: </strong>\"Why doesn't one team just plan to do standing start, safety-first baton changes?\" wonders Chris Mills, not unreasonably. \"They would probably get a silver every time. Relying on other's incompetence is a reliable tactic in anything involving human beings. Don't strive to excel, sit down and let success come.\"</p> <!-- Block 205 --> <p><strong>3.10pm: Athletics: Jamaica break the world record in the men's 4x100m relay</strong></p> <!-- Block 206 --> <p><strong>3.12pm: Three golds, three world records for Usain Bolt</strong></p> <!-- Block 207 --> <p><strong>3.15pm: </strong>Amazing stuff in the Bird's Nest, where Nesta Carter, Michael Frater, Usain Bolt and Asafa Powell have just shaved 0.3secs off the world record for the 4x100m relay. They win it by close to a full second, from Trinidad and Tobago and Japan. Bolt ran the third leg, incidentally, before handing off to Powell for the anchor. Get the party started.</p> <!-- Block 208 --> <p><strong>3.22pm:</strong> And with that, and because my computer is crashing every other minute, we're drawing this shambles to a close. Thanks for the emails, sorry for the typos, join us tomorrow for more of the same. Bye.</p>"
