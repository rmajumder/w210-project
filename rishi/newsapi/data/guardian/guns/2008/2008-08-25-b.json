  "<p>The first time I met Melissa Quinn, she was wearing her best coat, a woollen one with big dogtooth checks. It was February and cold outside, but the meeting room at the Rathbone charity's centre in Chorley, Lancashire, was well heated. Yet Melissa sat hunched inside her coat as we talked, as if she might leave at any moment.</p> <p>Even when she was sitting still, 15-year-old Melissa seemed to have a sort of perpetual motion about her. Her speech was fast, slightly stumbling. She spoke a lot, the words tumbling from her, but she looked down angrily at the table. Everything about her said she was troubled. </p> <p>\"When I was five, I was in the Co-op one day with my Mum and we saw this man,\" she said during a long, sad exposition on her life. \"I said, 'Who's that?' It turned out it was my Dad. Since then I've seen him on Sundays - when he shows up. My Mum's staying in B&amp;B in Blackpool now. But I just want to be with her. I love my Mum to bits, and I miss her. I just want her back.\" She stared at the table, wordlessly, for just a couple of seconds.</p> <p>In many ways, Melissa was like thousands of other refugees from family trauma, living in foster care and angry with the world. In one sense, though, she was not typical. Most such children would have been excluded from school when they hit a teacher in the stomach, as she had done. But instead, she was offered a place on the Lancashire Education Alternative Provision programme, or Leap. I had arranged to follow her progress, along with that of some of her classmates.</p> <p>Under this project, 14-16s at risk of exclusion can stay on the roll of their school and yet spend two or three days a week at this centre. Run in partnership with local secondary schools, the programme aims to re-engage disaffected youngsters without the need for a formal exclusion from school.</p> <p>Contracted out to Rathbone, which runs projects for 13,500 young people across the country, Leap could provide a window into the future. The Department for Children, Schools and Families is currently consulting on plans for a much wider range of options for pupils like Melissa. They include inviting private and voluntary organisations to come up with alternatives - like this one - to the existing pupil referral units where excluded children are educated, as well as opening small-scale \"studio schools\" offering a business-based education.</p> <p><strong>Unique approach</strong></p> <p>Dr Richard Williams, chief executive of Rathbone, says he believes voluntary organisations have something unique to offer: \"There's something quite fundamental about the culture and approach of an organisation like ours. I think at the heart of it is a real focus on the idea of personalisation. It strikes me it doesn't matter whether it's a private, voluntary or statutory entity - I think what people are trying to reach for is a model of interacting with young people that operates at that personal level.\"</p> <p>Even on my first visit, it was clear the Leap programme was working for some pupils. In the IT suite, 16-year-old Emma Charnock was finishing a project about drinking. She had questioned 11 of her friends and had discovered that nine drank more than 20 units of alcohol a week. Eight preferred beer, seven preferred spirits, and most thought drinking too much was bad for them. </p> <p>She had seen alcohol problems at first hand in her own family, she said, and she was introduced to cannabis by her mother's boyfriend while she was still at primary school. Within a year or two, Emma was smoking skunk regularly and missing school. \"I just used to stay in bed all day and get stoned,\" she explained. \"All I cared about was where my next joint was coming from.\"</p> <p>On the rare occasions Emma did attend school, she was often stressed out by some minor incident and would walk out or get into trouble. The wake-up call came, she said, when her older sister had a baby at 15 and suffered from postnatal depression. Emma's mother had problems of her own so Emma, then 14, took on the childcare, knowing that otherwise the baby would be taken into care.</p> <p>\"People at school were different to me,\" she said. \"I was used to mixing with older people. They were just like babies themselves. I would sit in a classroom and someone would say something. And then I'd say something back and start arguing and then I'd get emotional and walk out.\"</p> <p>Emma was pretty and neatly dressed, her blonde hair pulled back from her face. She had a quiet air about her, and the Rathbone staff said she was a model pupil - polite, punctual, hard-working. When I first met her she was about to have an interview for a work placement in a hairdressers'. Yet she would only be eligible to stay at the Leap project for a few months before she reached the end of her compulsory education. After that she would have to cope in work or at college.</p> <p>The recent consultation on the government's Back on Track white paper, the responses to which are being considered by officials at present, looks unlikely to answer the question of what should happen to pupils like Emma and Melissa once they turn 16. In five years' time it will become compulsory for them to stay in education or training, yet very little has been said about how they will cope without the sort of safety net Leap or a pupil referral unit can offer.</p> <p>Jacky Mackenzie, secretary of the National Organisation of Pupil Referral Units, says vulnerable pupils are at risk of dropping out if they go straight to a mainstream FE college. \"PRUs are very good at getting the right destinations for young people, but six months down the line, if we check them out how many will still be there?\" she asks. \"These young people are more likely to have ongoing crises or critical incidents in their lives, which need to be supported. What they need is that little bit extra, going the extra mile.\" </p> <p>But David Lammy, the minister for skills, says he is sure close monitoring of these teenagers' progress will ensure they don't get lost. If they do, they should be picked up when they visit the jobcentre, he believes.</p> <p><strong>Positive lives</strong></p> <p>\"For the first time we are being very, very proactive about these young people, so they can move smoothly into employment and more positive lives,\" he says. \"I don't underestimate the scale of the challenge. I know many of these young people come from chaotic lives but they will now be tracked, we will know what's happening to them. It's never too late when there are wonderful voluntary organisations working in the community - education is lifelong.\"</p> <p>When I returned to the centre in June, Melissa was expecting to return in September for another year at Leap. Emma, meanwhile, had decided not to take up her hairdressing placement but to take GCSEs and then apply to do nailcare at college. The Leap experience seemed to have been particularly good for Melissa, who seemed almost a different girl.</p> <p>This time she was dressed in sweats, yet it was not just her clothing that had relaxed. I realised after we had been talking for half an hour or so that I didn't remember seeing her smile last time I was there. Now she was full of banter, laughing and joking. When I mentioned her garb at our last meeting, she fixed me with a hard stare: \"Embarrass me, and I will kill you.\" She had started a two-day-a-week placement at National Tyres in Preston, and was loving it. </p> <p>Although both Emma and Melissa were still officially attending school, both clearly had negative feelings about it. Emma hadn't been since before Christmas and Melissa hadn't been for a couple of weeks before my last visit. She confessed that on the days when she was meant to go to school she often hung around the shops instead. But both attended the Rathbone centre regularly.</p> <p>\"I hate school. I just don't like it. I don't learn anything at school,\" Melissa said. When pressed to say why Rathbone was different, she was unsure.</p> <p>\"It's weird, hard to say,\" she said. \"Here they don't talk to you like teachers, they talk to you like friends...\"</p> <p>Emma, who had been thinking about the question, cut in: \"If I could turn back time, I would do it all different,\" she said suddenly. \"If I could do it again, I wouldn't get stoned every day. To be honest with you, I didn't really care about my future until now.\"</p>",
  "<p>The economist Milton Friedman continues to divide opinion from the grave. Admirers believe that his free-market gospel helped to spur the greatest surge of global entrepreneurial activity and wealth production in the last hundred years. His critics say he provided an ideological alibi for the biggest upward redistribution of wealth in living memory, with a devil-take-the-hindmost attitude towards the non-rich. </p> <p>So when the University of Chicago, whose economics department has been an incubator for the free-market creed, announced in May that a new institute would be named in his honour, it set off a fierce intellectual skirmish. </p> <p>Seven committee members were appointed last year to formulate a plan for a research centre on \"economy and society\": five were economists, the sixth came from the law school and the seventh was based at the business school (which opened a thriving London branch in 2005). </p> <p>\"The economics department is small, compared to some of its rivals,\" Lars Hansen, the interim director of the new institute, told the Guardian. This is a chance, he believes, \"to reach out and broaden\" its approach, resources, and influence.</p> <p>The university is coughing up half a million dollars for start-up costs this autumn and is seeking $200m more. Anyone donating a million or more is offered \"privileged access\" to the institute. </p> <p>But 101 tenured professors - 8% of the teaching staff - have petitioned the university's president, Robert Zimmer, to convene a meeting of all staff in the coming academic year to discuss the purposes of the institute. To which Zimmer has agreed. </p> <p><strong>Rich man's club</strong></p> <p>A distinguished anthropologist, Marshall Sahlins, is among those who fear that the institute will operate as \"a rich man's club\", and operate on the principle that \"the people who have the most money have the most truth\".</p> <p>A fellow petitioner, Bruce Lincoln, professor in the department of religion, anticipates that the institute will generate \"a symbiosis of a certain kind of donor with a certain kind of institute\" in what he calls a \"feedback loop\" to help the wealthy to become wealthier at the expense of everyone else.</p> <p>\"This is a big departure from the mission of the university,\" Lincoln complains.</p> <p>Hansen responds: \"To set up an institute with no criticism from outside would be silly to us. That's not our ambition.\"</p> <p>Friedman, who died in 2006, was one of very few economists to become a household name, partly due to writing in popular publications (such as Newsweek), partly because of several television series championing his market-knows-best ideology, and partly as a result of his enormous appeal to conservatives. </p> <p>In postwar America, Friedman's market fundamentalism was regarded as lunatic-fringe stuff until Vietnam overspending, the collapse of the gold standard in 1971, stagflation and the oil crises. The problems seemed at least as much political in nature as economic.</p> <p>In the 1980s, President Ronald Reagan invoked Friedman's anti-governmental philosophy as the answer to American economic woes - although Reagan heretically indulged in protectionism, corporate tax breaks and subsidies at the same time as he cut taxes and regulations. </p> <p>The free-market case spread to Britain, too, where the prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, was an ardent supporter. She shared the dislike of Friedman and his followers for regulation, trade unions, the welfare state and public works.</p> <p><strong>Chicago boys</strong></p> <p>The institute debate reopens old sores on campus stretching back to a 1970s uproar about the \"Chicago boys\".</p> <p>They were hardcore proponents of the free market, trained at the university principally by Arnold Harberger and by Friedman himself. (The latter also worked for General Pinochet in Chile, imposing free markets, critics say, at the point of a bayonet.) </p> <p>Sahlins says that the purpose of the Milton Friedman institute seems to be to \"make the university safe for free markets the same way that the Chicago boys made the world safe for free enterprise\". Institutes named after controversial people do not always emulate their views, but the founding committee's mission statement sounds unequivocal: \"Following Friedman's lead, the design and evaluation of economic policy requires analyses that respect the incentives of individuals and the essential role of markets in allocating goods and services. As Friedman and others continually demonstrated, design of public policy without regard to market alternatives has adverse social consequences.\"</p> <p>The petitioners find this statement hard to square with reassurances of scholarly openness. </p> <p>Committee member John Cochrane of the business school deems the lecturers' petition \"drivel\" and wonders \"just what is it that you good-thinking guys and gals have against human freedom?\" The centre, Cochrane insists, is conceived of \"pretty explicitly as an economic research institute without a particular ideology\".</p> <p>Economist bloggers describe the petitioners as \"pinks\", \"pathetic\" and \"driven by purest envy\". </p> <p>\"That shows the contempt with which these people treat those who don't share their orthodoxy,\" Lincoln replies. \"They feel entitled and dismissive.\"</p> <p><strong>Fraught atmosphere</strong></p> <p>Critics believe independent scholars would be unlikely to want to step into this fraught atmosphere. Most economists would give the new institute a wide berth, they fear.</p> <p>A \"really robust institute\" would be one that explored all kinds of visions, Lincoln argues, and has a \"place for Friedmanite theory within a larger spectrum\". </p> <p>He adds: \"The centre contradicts the spirit of inquiry, openness and give-and-take that a university ought to be devoted to.\"</p> <p>But the founding committee members say they are puzzled by all the fuss, and suggest that the petitioners are pushing against an open door.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The committee report, lecturers' petition and other corespondance regarding the Milton Friedman Institute can be found <a href=\"http://www.stat.uchicago.edu/~amit/MFI/index.html\">here</a></p> <h2>Politics of research</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Building of the George W Bush library, museum and research centre is due to begin at the Southern Methodist University in Dallas next year. A 12,500-signature petition says the institute is \"utterly unacceptable\".</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>The Hoover Institution, a neocon thinktank on the Stanford campus, in California, is not formally part of the university and has its own staff. Gary Becker, one of the founding committee members of the Milton Friedman Institute, is a member.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>The John M Olin Foundation pumped more than $300m into conservative scholarship before shutting down in 2005. This included John M Olin institutes at Harvard and Chicago.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>From 1970 to 2000, there was an increase from fewer than 70 to more than 300 thinktanks, with two-thirds of the new ones being conservative in orientation, according to Andrew Rich, author of Think Tanks, Public Policy and the Politics of Expertise.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>In 1996, donors gave $47.8m to liberal institutes, $169m to conservative ones and $319m to places of no identifiable leanings.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Most partisan research centres are unconnected to universities. The Hoover Institution, Heritage Foundation and American Enterprise Institute, line up against the Institute for Policy Studies, the Progressive Policy Institute and People for the American Way, on the liberal left.</p>",
  "<p>Indian security forces fired into crowds of demonstrators yesterday who defied curfews in the Kashmi valley, killing at least four people, as a new generation of youth appeared radicalised by the call for the state's independence from India.</p> <p>In a series of confrontations around Srinagar, crowds of several thousand faced down Indian troops and police. Four deaths have been confirmed while seven people are in a critical condition.</p> <p>The state government said soldiers only opened fire after being attacked - a claim separatist groups say is an attempt to justify the use of deadly force.</p> <p>Many of the dead appear to be either innocent victims or young Kashmiris armed with little more than rocks and a set of well-worn pro-independence slogans.</p> <p>In the maze of backstreets, the blood of 62-year-old shopkeeper Ghulam Qadir Hajam is still splattered on the walls near his family home. Outside a crowd has gathered with a single word on their lips: \"Azadi\" (freedom from India).</p> <p>Hajam, said his family, was shot dead trying to save his eldest son Mohammed Yaquob being beaten with the butt a rifle by a group of Indian soldiers on Sunday.</p> <p>\"My brother had gone to get milk for the family,\" said Hilal Ahmad, another son. \"We heard a noise and rushed outside and saw my brother being beaten. My father then started to cry out to leave his son alone and the soldiers shot him. We are ordinary shopkeepers and [soldiers] used to come to our shop to buy milk. They knew us. Why did they kill us?\"</p> <p>The use of \"overwhelming force\" has dismayed mainstream Kashmiri politicians, who have long defended Indian rule. Omar Abdullah, an MP in the Indian parliament whose grandfather took Kashmir into the Indian Union, told the Guardian that he was considering resigning.</p> <p>\"People in Kashmir know that the armed struggle has got them nowhere. So they are trying peaceful demonstrations. However, if the use of overwhelming force is used against peaceful protest then what is my role? What space are you leaving [for democrats],\" said Abdullah. \"I don't think an independent Kashmir can survive but let's have that debate.\"</p> <p>The latest protests in the Muslim-majority state have their roots in a decision in May to give 40 hectares (100 acres) of land in the Himalayas to a Hindu shrine, which is visited by 100,000 pilgrims a year.</p> <p>The order has been rescinded temporarily by Delhi, but the demonstrations in Kashmir have broadened into a pro-independence movement. Hindus in Kashmir's Jammu region have responded by blockading the main highway linking the plains of India to Srinagar.</p> <p>After weeks of protests by separatist leaders, which culminated in 500,000 gathering in Srinagar on Friday, the army began a crackdown. First newspapers were shut down and local news broadcasts banned. A curfew was then imposed, emptying the streets of Srinagar on Sunday.</p> <p>The main political separatist leaders were arrested and imprisoned yesterday. Military checkpoints have been set up every few hundred metres and buildings have been covered in barbed wire.</p> <p>The attempt by the authorities to snuff out the protests have confirmed in many people's minds that the Indian government would never consider anything but the status quo for Kashmir - over which India has fought two wars with its nuclear-armed neighbour Pakistan since 1947.</p> <p>\"Delhi does not want to see the Kashmir problem in terms of self-determination,\" said Sheikh Showkat Hussain, a law lecturer at University of Kashmir.</p>",
  "<p>Russia was last night on another collision course with the west after Russian MPs voted unanimously to back independence for Georgia's two breakaway republics of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The move - which requires the approval of Russia's president, Dmitry Medvedev - gives a strong domestic legal basis for the Kremlin to take control of the areas after Russia's invasion of Georgia this month.</p> <p>Russia's upper house, or Federation Council, voted by 130-0 to call on Medvedev to support South Ossetia and Abkhazia's independence. The Duma passed the same motion by 447-0. Both houses are known for their slavish loyalty to the Kremlin.</p> <p>The US and the EU swiftly denounced the vote. George Bush said he was \"deeply concerned\" by the move, and the White House said the vice-president, Dick Cheney, would visit Tbilisi next week. The EU said the breakaway regions should remain in Georgia. The German government called the move \"in no way appropriate to either calming or defusing tensions\".</p> <p>But there were strong signs last night that Moscow remains unmoved by the threat of western sanctions, which have been growing since Russia invaded Georgia after Georgia's military incursion into South Ossetia this month.</p> <p>The US, France, Britain and other EU countries are considering punitive measures. These include ending Nato cooperation with Moscow, freezing Russia's application to join the World Trade Organisation, and suspending its participation in G8 summits.</p> <p>Speaking in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, however, Medvedev yesterday suggested he would be unconcerned if Nato chose to sever ties. This would be \"no great loss\", he said. \"If they choose to break off this relationship, even the whole of it, nothing terrible will happen.\" </p> <p>Medvedev's comments signal a further deterioration in Russia's fraught relations with the west. The French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, has convened a special EU meeting on Georgia on Monday to consider future relations with Moscow. </p> <p>The meeting comes amid growing dismay at Russia's failure to comply with the ceasefire agreement and pull out all of its troops. </p> <p>Russia has previously stopped short of recognising the regions' independence. But Moscow is likely to use the votes to pressure the international community into accepting Abkhazia and South Ossetia as no different from Kosovo - whose US-backed declaration of independence in February was vehemently opposed by Russia and Serbia.</p> <p>The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, recently indicated a change by saying that Georgia could \"forget about\" its territorial integrity. But promoting separatism in the Caucasus holds dangers for Russia, which faces growing insurgencies in its southern republics and has fought two brutal wars combating separatism in Chechnya.</p> <p>One analyst said it was unlikely that the Kremlin would unilaterally recognise South Ossetian and Abkhazian independence. \"This would be more troublesome and problematic for Russia,\" said Fyodor Lukyanov, the editor-in-chief of the journal Russia in Global Affairs.</p> <p>Russia's preferred \"scenario\" would be for the two to eventually win Kosovo-style acceptance, he said, rather than suffer the unresolved fate of Turkish-backed northern Cyprus. </p> <p>\"My guess is that this vote is a means to achieve better conditions for international negotiations,\" he added. </p> <p>Georgia's national security council secretary, Alexander Lomaia, said the Kremlin would isolate itself if it recognised the regions, which have enjoyed de facto independence since the early 1990s.</p> <p>\"If it does this, Russia will further isolate itself from the entire world, and will force the international community to seek more active ways to restore the territorial integrity of Georgia,\" he told Reuters.</p> <p>Georgia yesterday said Russian troops continued to occupy much of the country. In the Black Sea port of Poti, south of Abkhazia, Russian soldiers drove into the port terminal and took away computers and photocopiers in armoured personnel carriers, Georgian officials said.</p> <p>The deputy chief of Russia's army staff, Colonel-General Anatoly Nogovitsyn, said his troops were merely performing peacekeeping duties, adding that the EU-brokered ceasefire deal allowed them to be there, despite the fact that it calls for Russian forces to return to the positions they occupied before the war started.</p> <p>He said Russian troops were needed in Poti, not least because of the arrival in the area of Nato ships: \"The fact that there are nine western warships in the Black Sea cannot but be a cause for concern.\"</p> <h2>Market verdict</h2> <p>Russia is facing another chastening reprimand, this time from the financial markets. The main stock index has fallen 20% in the last month, dipping yesterday to its lowest level since November 2006. The rouble is also under pressure. Georgia is not the only factor, but it has clearly rattled the markets. However, Russia is a long way from a repeat of its financial meltdown, the 10th anniversary of which recently passed almost unnoticed.</p>",
  "<p>One of the government's most senior advisers on the regeneration of cities has warned that a tax imposed on empty commercial buildings is threatening to derail efforts to breathe new life into some of the most blighted parts of Britain.</p> <p>John Nicholls, who chairs a group representing the government-funded urban regeneration companies (URCs), said yesterday that owners are demolishing empty buildings to avoid paying the tax introduced in the most recent budget, leaving parts of the country \"resembling bomb sites\". Regeneration projects had been rendered unworkable, threatening jobs and new homes, he said. Some developers are simply leaving sites unfinished rather than risk liability for the tax.</p> <p>\"There is a lot of pre-emptive demolition going on. This is already having a visual impact - cities are beginning to look like broken teeth.\"</p> <p>The measure has been fiercely opposed by business lobby groups including the Confederation of British Industry, the British Chambers of Commerce and the British Retail Consortium - the latest in a series of clashes between business and Labour since Gordon Brown became prime minister and Alistair Darling took over as chancellor.</p> <p>Before the changes, vacant offices and shops received rate relief of 50% and industrial units gained full relief. Now all unused commercial property has to pay full business rates after a three-month period of grace for commercial premises and six months for industrial property and warehouses, adding about \u00a31.3bn a year to government coffers.</p> <p>Swindon council has joined the campaign to get the tax repealed. It is demolishing a 14-acre former factory at the cost of \u00a3430,000 rather than continue to pay \u00a3110,000 a year in tax on that one site alone.</p> <p>\"We are spending public money demolishing buildings to avoid this ill-thought out stealth tax,\" said Nick Martin, lead member for finance at Swindon council. \"Swindon, like many other towns across the country, could suffer if regeneration projects are shelved as a result of this.\"</p> <p>Salmon Developments, a property company in London's West End, said it had implemented a policy of demolishing all of the older buildings in its portfolio that it had failed to let after three months. </p> <p>Nicholls warned that the tax is having a punitive effect on the kind of brownfield residential projects that the government is keen to encourage. Developers usually need to assemble land through a complex series of deals, a time-consuming process that may well involve holding industrial, office or retail premises for a period while other parts of a site are acquired. Liability for business rates on those properties added to the cost and the risk.</p> <p>A Treasury spokesman yesterday defended the tax reform and said it had followed the independent recommendations of experts Kate Barker and Sir Michael Lyons to encourage owners to bring empty properties back into productive use and discourage deliberate dereliction. \"Reforms to empty property relief are aimed at ensuring there is a fairer balance between incentives to re-let property and giving property managers a period of relief while they manage vacancies.\"</p> <p>The government is monitoring the impact of the reforms. There are provisions in the legislation for rates to be cut by 50% again depending on the state of the economy.</p> <p>The relationship between business and Labour has soured over the past year, with rows over the taxation of high-earning non-doms, the botched increase in capital gains tax, increases to fuel duty and a steady increase in corporation tax for smaller firms. </p> <p>The URCs warned privately of the potential adverse consequences of the reforms in May last year, but have now decided to take the campaign to ditch the tax public.</p> <p>Nicholls said that the URCs had never received a proper response to the concerns raised almost a year before introduction of the tax, in which they warned it was inevitable that properties would be demolished. There are 19 URCs in England, independent companies set up by the local authority and Regional Development Agency and created to champion investment into areas of economic decline.</p>",
  "<p>Pakistan's coalition government collapsed yesterday when one of its leading members stormed out, dealing a heavy blow to hopes for political stability following Pervez Musharraf's resignation as president.</p> <p>Former prime minister Nawaz Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League-N said it was joining the opposition, blaming its coalition partner, the Pakistan People's Party, for failing to reinstate judges fired by Musharraf last November, and for disagreements over who should succeed Musharraf as president.</p> <p>\"We therefore feel that these repeated defaults and violations have forced us to withdraw our support from the ruling coalition and sit on the opposition benches,\" Sharif told a news conference.</p> <p>Islamabad now appears poised for renewed political convulsions rather than the unity required to take on the violent challenge from Islamic extremists based in its North West Frontier Province (NWFP) and the tribal territory that borders Afghanistan. The ousting of Musharraf as president just a week ago, meant to end the intrigue, only succeeded in pushing the political crisis into a new phase. </p> <p>That will dismay Pakistan's western partners, who want the government to tackle the Taliban-inspired militancy in the tribal area, which is a base for the insurgency in Afghanistan.</p> <p>\"While there is not a stable government in Islamabad, then the law and order situation in NWFP and [the federally administered tribal areas] FATA will not be solved,\" warned Asfandyar Wali Khan, leader of the party that runs the provincial government of NWFP. \"Saving lives should be the first issue, then we can look at the judges.\" </p> <p>Sharif's defection means the PPP is now reliant on the support of new partners, including the Muttahida Qaumi Movement, MQM, a party that was close to Musharraf. Sharif also announced he will put up his own candidate for president, to challenge the Pakistan People's Party's chairman Asif Zardari, Benazir Bhutto's widower. Saeed-uz-Zaman Siddiqui, a supreme court judge who retired in 2002, will be Sharif's candidate. </p> <p>At the press conference in Islamabad, a bitter Sharif brandished an agreement forged with the PPP, promising the restoration of the judiciary within 24 hours of Musharraf's departure. Sharif made the cause the centre-point of his politics, but the coalition missed three deadlines. The deal, said Sharif, also included having a non-partisan new president, until the powers of the presidency were reduced. </p> <p>Sharif and the Pakistan People's Party were vicious rivals in the 1990s, alternating in power until the military coup in 1999 - led by then army chief General Musharraf, who described the period as the \"dreadful decade of democracy\". The power struggle between the two parties, now revived, is likely to be first felt over the provincial government of the Punjab, currently held by Mr Sharif's party.</p> <p>\"Are we now a laughing stock for those who didn't want democracy in Pakistan? For them, it's a victory, but we're both losers,\" said a PPP member of parliament, Fauzia Wahab. \"By fighting each other, you are actually defeating democracy.\" </p> <p>Sharif's non-party candidate for president could be a masterstroke. While Siddiqui is highly unlikely to defeat Zardari, he could certainly embarrass him. </p> <p>The terrorist challenge was underlined yesterday with a rocket-and-bomb attack on the home of a provincial member of parliament in Swat, part of NWFP. The politician escaped, but his brother, two nephews and five guards were killed. Pakistan also belatedly banned the main insurgent group, the Tehreek-e-Taliban, signalling that hopes of holding dialogue with the militants had evaporated.</p>",
  "<p>Thousands of British expats who lost out to Spain's notorious \"land grab\" laws were yesterday given hope of getting their properties back after the European commission took Madrid to the European court of justice.</p> <p>The commission is to take legal action against Spain over alleged infringements of European competition regulations governing public works contracts. It claims that in Valencia such contracts were awarded without fair competition.</p> <p>The law, introduced in the 1990s at the start of a prolonged housing boom, allows developers to expropriate rural land from owners if they can persuade the authorities that it is suitable for \"urban development\". Adding insult to injury, they can then charge the owners for services such as electricity for the new development.</p> <p>The homes of thousands of British and other owners have been demolished or left worthless by ruthless property developers taking advantage of the law.</p> <p>Though the law was made by the Valencian authorities, Spain has to answer in court, as it is an EU member and must comply with the bloc's competition rules. If the action is successful it could mean large fines for Spain, and Madrid may put pressure on Valencia to change the law.</p> <p>Charles Svoboda, vice-president of Abusos Urbanisticos No, a campaign group that has fought the law for the past four years, said: \"The commission does not take these actions if it does not intend to penalise the country concerned. It could be the beginning of the end of these laws.\"</p> <p>The case claims that public works contracts worth more than \u20ac5.5m were awarded to cronies of those who made the contract decisions.</p> <p>The legal action gives some hope to Britons such as Danny Loveridge, who retired to a 130-year-old farmhouse near the Valencian town of Benissa several years ago. He lost more than \u00a3160,000 after developers moved in on his land.</p> <p>\"They took almost 75% of our land and gave us some other land that was worthless,\" he said. \"There is now a bathroom fittings shop where our house was.\"</p> <p>Loveridge was paid \u00a38,000 in compensation, but was then forced to pay the developers \u00a312,500 for the electricity, sewage, roads and other infrastructure for a proposed industrial estate.</p> <p>He was forced to sell what remained of a \u00a3260,000 property for about \u00a3100,000.</p> <p>In 2004, a report to the European parliament denounced \"serious abuses\" committed under the terms of a \"surrealistic\" land law in Valencia, in eastern Spain, and demanded compensation for thousands of people who had lost homes and money.</p> <p>No one was available for comment at the Spanish government or Valencian regional government last night.</p>",
  "<p>He was nothing special, except to his parents. Not a trophy winner or football champion; not the class joker or swot. He was small for a 12-year-old, with glasses and a tentative smile - the sort of boy who blurs into the crowd in school photos, who stands aside in the corner of a playground.</p> <p>\"He was born prematurely, at less than eight months. He wasn't very strong, so we spent all our money seeking treatment for him,\" his mother told me. \"We had so many hopes and expectations for him: he was the source of all our mental strength. We didn't expect him to be a 'great man' - but we hoped he would be a good one. Now we hope the government can give us a satisfactory explanation and justice.\"</p> <p>She was speaking less than a fortnight after her son had been crushed in the total collapse of Fuxin No 2 Elementary in Mianzhu, Sichuan. He was one of 4,700 children who died when their schools crumbled around them in the earthquake that ripped through south-west China on May 12. Three months on, the government has made extraordinary strides in rebuilding a province where at least 70,000 died. Temporary homes and basic amenities have appeared with startling speed. Adults are back at business; children have returned to study. At the Olympic opening ceremony, a nine-year-old survivor, who saved several classmates, bore the Chinese flag alongside basketball player Yao Ming.</p> <p>Yet behind the image of communal resilience lies an uglier story. The authorities are striving to aid millions of survivors. But they are also doing their best to silence angry families who want to know why so many schools collapsed when the buildings around them endured. </p> <p>No one is speaking for these parents. Not the foreign protesters who have flagged up issues such as Tibet and religious freedom through demonstrations in Beijing. Not non-governmental organisations in Sichuan, which are painfully aware that supporting them would spell the end to their other work there. And not the handful of activists who tried, but earned themselves detention. Instead, parents are speaking for themselves, despite the harassment and threats that have dogged them over the past eight weeks. They have been dragged away from protests, prevented from travelling to Beijing to air their complaints, and warned against talking to foreign reporters.</p> <p>\"Now they do not even allow us to gather together,\" one man told me. He had agreed to speak by telephone, despite his concern that the call might be monitored. \"The officials asked us to be patient. They told us we need to support the Olympics, and after the Olympics they will sort this out. But we have been waiting for such a long time ... I guess they hope that if the time is long enough we will just forget this.\"</p> <p>When I came across Fuxin, I had been in Sichuan, covering the earthquake's aftermath, for almost two weeks; it was the sixth ruined school I had found. </p> <p>By the government's estimates, 7,000 classrooms collapsed in the tremor. In Dujiangyan, children lay on the street in body bags; in Hanwang, they were stored on concrete ping-pong tables in the schoolyard; in Beichuan, the ground was thick with small corpses, ghostly with dust. The air stank of death. A teenager described lying trapped under rubble, touching the cooling skin of a classmate and knowing that she was dead. Another young boy came up to ask if anyone knew the fate of his best friend. Everywhere you went there were small bodies and welling pain and anger - magnified by the needlessness of their deaths.</p> <p>In areas such as Beichuan, the force of the quake destroyed almost everything in its path. Homes and shops and offices were thrown sideways or simply crashed to the ground. Schools suffered because everything did. But in other areas, such as Dujiangyan, schools crumbled while the buildings around them stood almost unscathed. Fuxin was another of those, and the contrast between the surrounding structures and the rubble of the classrooms had roused parents' fury. Most were farmers or small traders; they were poor, largely uneducated people, who had never challenged authority. </p> <p>Pain overwhelmed their fear. The parents were not just willing to confront officials; they were desperate to do so. Each day, they gathered at the site, lit candles at a makeshift shrine to their children and waited for the authorities to come and apologise. Unclaimed schoolbags lay in a grimy pile; books, pencils and a scatter of fuchsia sequins poked through the dust. </p> <p>The Guardian's photographer and I arrived shortly after the town's education chief finally came to pay his respects, following repeated requests from the parents. He said the matter was under investigation, then added: \"I feel sad too, but it's a natural disaster.\" He reminded them that 11 schools had collapsed across the city. Before us, the families' grief was metastasising into anger - a rage impossible to ignore as the parents screamed into his imperturbable face: \"Why are your hearts so black?\" \"Why did our children die?\" Fathers hacked at the remains to demonstrate concrete you could brush away like powder and thin steel frames that had buckled beyond recognition. They believed that substandard construction had claimed the lives of the 127 students who died here; and those of many more students in other schools across the province. </p> <p>Across the country, millions of Chinese citizens were drawing the same conclusion. Public outrage was swelling. The state media asked awkward questions and experts came forward to condemn poor design and construction. The investigative magazine Caijing examined five schools and claimed that none of the sites had been surveyed. The government fielded questions online and promised an inquiry into whether poor building work, linked to corruption, was to blame. </p> <p>When the Fuxin parents marched to higher authorities, the Communist party secretary for Mianzhu city got on his knees to beg them to stop. They ignored him. Throughout the quake zone, the authorities were showing not just humility but unusual openness. They welcomed volunteers from across the country, invited overseas relief teams and allowed reporters to cover the disaster unhindered. </p> <p>For a few days in the wake of our visit it seemed as if the parents' questions might be answered. The thaw did not last long. Within weeks, the censors had ordered the media to drop the subject. Within the month, police were dragging parents away from protests. The families fought back, at first. They threatened to register their dead children for the new school year. They pledged to sue. They protested outside government offices. They spoke to activists whom they hoped might help them. </p> <p>But by the time I returned to Fuxin, there was no sign of the angry demonstrations I had witnessed. The ruins of the school were guarded through the day. Plain-clothes police were watching the site, and the homes of the most vocal parents. Many of the relatives, once desperate to tell their children's stories, were now too frightened to talk. \"They don't see the point of speaking to the foreign media; they don't think it's helped,\" one mother said. She had agreed to meet me at a nearby market and we drove around the back roads of the area, past lush, green rice fields, to avoid the attention of public security officials while we talked. Though a loyal party member, she feared retaliation if she was caught; like all those I spoke to this time, she asked not to be named.</p> <p>The previous day, five of the parents had planned to catch a train to Beijing, to petition the central authorities. It is one of the few routes left to those who believe local officials are ignoring them. But an edict from on high had warned provincial governments to ensure \"zero protests, zero petitioners to Beijing\" in the run-up to the Olympics. </p> <p>\"The Public Security Bureau were waiting for our representatives when they went to buy tickets at the station. I think they must have a list of us all because they knew who they were, and told them not to go. They have told us not to make trouble,\" she said. \"We don't want compensation; we just want someone held accountable. We don't want this to happen again,\" she added. As she spoke, she stroked a tiny photograph of her daughter. She was, she thought, too old to have another child; she did not sound as if she had the heart to try.</p> <p>The Fuxin parents sought a full investigation. Instead, they were offered money: 60,000 yuan (\u00a34,500), a huge sum by Chinese standards, but one that came at a cost. Parents reported coming under intense pressure to apply for the cash by signing a document that included a promise to abide by the law and maintain social order - in other words, stop protesting.</p> <p>\"We are not pursuing wealth; we just need justice - we want the people who deserve it to be punished,\" an angry father told us. \"But they were extremely eager that we would sign. They forced and deceived us. The officials stayed in our rooms until 11pm or 12pm, and they told us that others all signed this and if you did not sign you would be the only person who got nothing.</p> <p>\"So we signed, and the next day we found that they told everybody this. We found out that we had been cheated. They got rid of the evidence, the wreckage of the school [which they levelled]. They said they had to do it to prevent infectious diseases, but it was just because it showed that the building was dangerous. My child should not have died.\" There was, he added, little sign of the investigation that the authorities had promised.</p> <p>\"I thought the government would give us justice, but it now seems that is impossible,\" wept another woman. \"Some people still tell us that the government will solve this, but most of us think that they've been bought by officials. I haven't cried in the last three months, but I do now. Before, I thought the government would help us and if we had any trouble we could go to them. But when we went to them there was no one there.\"</p> <p>Nor can the parents turn to outside assistance. Last month, a human rights group reported that a teacher from Sichuan had been sentenced to a year's re-education in a labour camp for \"disseminating rumours and destroying social order\" - that is, photographing the ruins of the schools and circulating the pictures on the internet, along with criticism of the construction standards. </p> <p>Liu Shaokun is thought to be the third person held for posting such material. The family of Huang Qi, a long-standing human rights activist from Sichuan, says he was formally arrested for \"illegal possession of state secrets\" after helping bereaved parents and posting articles about structural failings of schools on his website. One of his articles was about Zeng Hongling, a former academic, who may have been first to be detained. According to a Hong Kong-based rights group she has been held on subversion charges after posting online essays attacking shoddy construction. </p> <p>The crackdown is all the more striking because the parents have never sought to challenge Beijing's authority. It is not an issue of national sovereignty, such as Tibet; or about restraints on alternative power structures, such as religion. They were not questioning the legitimacy of the government. They were simply embarrassing it at a moment when international attention to China made officials particularly sensitive. The country's increasing space for dissent, carved out over recent years, has been squeezed by the pressure to perfect its image ahead of the Olympics. The families' voices were potent and numerous; and the problem was too complex for a single person or department to take the rap. </p> <p>Corrupt officials siphoning off cash may have played a part in places. But so too, it seems, did inept designers, untrained labourers, contractors who themselves took an illicit cut of the budget, the factories who churned out poor-quality materials and the supervisors who failed to spot problems. \"There was no one person clearly responsible for the incident; you would need to overhaul the whole system,\" says Nicholas Bequelin, a China specialist at Human Rights Watch.</p> <p>The authorities' response to such complex issues was recognisable from previous scandals, he adds: pressure to take compensation in place of real redress. \"The government gives signs that it's serious and transparent and more accountable - but then these efforts fade away.\"</p> <p>\"One problem,\" he says, \"is the absence of a free press to keep the issue in the headlines. The incentive for finding out things that are going to embarrass you is just not there. A second is local inertia. Once [central government] officials have left, and the issue is not in their minds, the provincial bureaucracy reasserts itself in the old ways. It's a problem we have with a lot of positive steps the government takes.\"</p> <p>Earlier this month, the authorities announced a \u00a376bn recovery plan for the quake zone, promising to prioritise the reconstruction of schools and hospitals - and vowing to make them \"extremely safe and solid structures the public can feel reassured about\". It is not the first time school safety has been on the government's agenda. According to Caijing, last year Sichuan put aside \u00a355m to improve dangerous buildings. An at-risk register was compiled. Fuxin was not on it.</p>",
  "<p>Rebecca Adlington, the most celebrated of the Beijing bullion bearers who squeezed into a hotel suite beside Heathrow yesterday, looked admirably incredulous when told that a pub in her native Mansfield was going to be renamed the Adlington Arms.</p> <p>\"Really? Is that true?\" she asked with wide-eyed wonder. \"Wow. I know there is a pool that is going to name itself after me but I didn't know about the pub.\" When the landlord discovers that she is virtually teetotal he might change his mind.</p> <p>After flying in with the rest of Team GB, having being bumped up to first class, she said: \"I've never been in business class, let alone first class. I got a proper bed and duvet. But I only drank orange juice on the flight home.\"</p> <p>Beside her Colin Moynihan beamed. The chairman of the British Olympic Association must have felt that the days when he was ridiculed as \"the miniature for sport\" belonged to the distant past.</p> <p>With the murk and mizzle and the roar of the nearby M4 this was hardly a land fit for heroes and heroines. Not that Adlington recognised herself as such. </p> <p>The great irony about Adlington, who won golds in the 400 metres and 800m freestyle, setting a new world record in the latter event, is that she adores the ephemeral celebrities of reality TV while not appearing to realise that her own fame is as solid and long-lasting as the brace of gold medals around her neck. Strictly Come Dancing is her favourite programme.</p> <p>\"That was a week ago,\" says Britain's greatest ever Olympic swimmer, surprised that there are still people who want to talk to her after all this time. \"I'm certain that won't be the case in a month's time,\" she added, with a wonderful innocence. \"No one will want to be talking as I set off for training at five in the morning.\"</p> <p>Sponsorship? Again a look of mild bewilderment passed across her face. \"I most want to get a kit deal so that I don't keep buying equipment for swimming. I owe my parents a lot of money so any sponsorship is going to help them a lot more than me.\"</p> <p>Before the cycling and the canoeing and the rowing, it was Adlington who really stamped Britain's presence in these Games. And now she thinks she could go one better in London in 2012.</p> <p>\"I think we will win more medals in 2012,\" she said. \"And I might drop down to try the 200. I might have a go at all three. It all depends on how I develop as an athlete.</p> <p>\"I'll be 23 next time, which is a great age to be. But after that I want to do other stuff. Mark Foster's the crazy guy who keeps going but I'll want to do something else, go to university ...\"</p> <p>It is the strength of her extended family background in Nottinghamshire and the total absence of affectation that has beguiled us as much as her achievements in the pool. She even took her own pillow and duvet to China because she was unsure of the facilities there.</p> <p>Sibling rivalry can never have produced anything as astonishing as this. As a little girl she struggled to keep up with her older sisters, Laura and Chloe, when her swimming-teacher mother Kay took them to the pool. She refused to wear water wings when she was with them and the experience honed her competitive instincts.</p> <p>She started swimming at four, was identified as a special talent at six and by the age of 13 was training twice a day at a pool which involved a 50-mile round trip.</p> <p>She would leave home with her mother at 5.10am, eat breakfast in the car, train between 6-8, go to school, from where she would be collected at 3.45 and driven straight back to the pool for another two hours' training. </p> <p>She would arrive home at 8pm, have a meal, do her homework and be in bed by 9.30 in time for another early start the next morning. This is the way champions, particularly swimming champions, it seems, are made.</p> <p>\"But I never felt guilty,\" her mother said last night. \"Because she was so determined to do it herself. It was never a case of me pushing her.\"</p> <p>Now her third daughter could be made a dame at 19. \"No!\" says Rebecca, shaking her head. \"Kelly [Holmes] was different. She had already won honours.\" Sports personality of the year, perhaps?</p> <p>\"No chance! What about Chris Hoy. He won three golds. I look up to him. I'm starstruck by him.\" But Hoy, who had been less in demand yesterday, had long since departed. </p> <p>She is called Becks, like England's most famous footballer. But that is absolutely all these two have in common.</p> <h2>What next for winners?</h2> <p><strong>Chris Hoy</strong></p> <p>The cycling team will compete in the World Cup in Manchester from October 31 to November 2</p> <p><strong>Christine Ohuruogu</strong></p> <p>The 400m gold medallist is expected to run in the Aviva British grand prix in Gateshead on Sunday</p> <p><strong>James DeGale</strong></p> <p>The European championships are in Liverpool from November 5-15 - but he may turn pro before then</p> <p><strong>Tom James, Steve Williams, Pete Reed, Andrew Triggs Hodge</strong></p> <p>The men's four will compete for their clubs in the Head of the River Fours on the Thames on November 8</p>",
  "<p>High levels of air pollution in London have forced the government to seek an urgent meeting with the mayor, Boris Johnson, to avoid the risk of unlimited fines from Europe.</p> <p>The air quality minister, Jonathan Shaw, has written to the mayor offering the expertise of officials at the Department for Environment. The letter, written last month and obtained under freedom of information laws, says that Britain plans to ask for an extension until June 2011 to meet its legal requirements.</p> <p>Britain has been breaking EU air quality laws on particulate pollution for three years and in July the EU demanded a detailed plan of how it will comply. </p> <p>In addition, the new EU air quality directive will force the UK to reduce nitrogen dioxide pollution on some of the capital's busiest streets by more than a third by the end of 2009, in order to move towards World Health Organisation guidelines. If air quality improvements are not achieved quickly, the UK could be taken to the European court. The court has powers to impose unlimited fines. </p> <p>\"The objective was due to be met in 2005 but in recognition that nearly all member states are finding this very challenging ... [the government] intends to apply for this compliance flexibility,\" Shaw wrote. \"My officials wish to work with your officials. We should not underestimate the scale of the task and we will also need to develop further national as well as local measures.\"</p> <p>Air pollution in big cities is worsening as motorists switch from petrol to diesel to save fuel. Particulate pollution from diesel engines is linked to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and asthma. Air pollution causes an estimated 32,000 premature deaths a year in Britain and between 157,000 and 319,000 people in London are exposed to nitrogen dioxide levels above EU limits, the government says.</p> <p>\"The government has been aware of the problem since 1999 but has taken no action,\" said Simon Birkett, who chairs the Campaign for Clean Air in London. \"These obligations can only be met if long overdue action is taken now.\"</p> <p>However, the government is in difficult political territory because taking such action will depend on Conservative party cooperation and the backing of Johnson, who in the three months since he was elected has threatened to ditch several measures that have improved air quality, including the western extension of the congestion charge and twice yearly taxi checks. </p> <p>In addition, he is backing the expansion of London City airport and considering a road bridge over the Thames in east London, both of which would worsen pollution in the capital. </p> <p>It is expected that London will have to introduce additional low emission zones with tighter standards than the existing zone, which covers only large vehicles, and could also demand that vehicles fit pollution abatement equipment.</p> <p>It will also be challenging for the government to meet the EU target for nitrogen dioxide. Average annual concentrations in parts of central London are more than double the standard set in 1999, which became law earlier this year and requires compliance within 16 months. </p> <p>The mayor's office said he was fully committed to working with the government. \"He is also working, through Transport for London, to cut emissions from transport through a shift to walking and cycling and the use of new technology. He has committed \u00a31m for the development of less polluting taxis, while by 2012 all new buses on the streets will have lower emission hybrid engines.\"</p>",
  "<p>Once again the relationship between doctors and the pharmaceutical industry is presented as a moral mire into which doctors are sinking (Drug giants accused over doctors' perks, August 23).</p> <p>I have benefited from many meetings either organised or funded by the industry, and I believe I am a better doctor for it. On these conferences, I have met colleagues from around the world, and shared medical knowledge. Sometimes there is heavy selling of a particular drug, but in my experience it is counterproductive. For many drugs there is little to choose between rival products, and where there is a front-runner, the competition cannot make up for poor effectiveness with good dinners. </p> <p>Concern about costs should be directed at the relationship between government and industry - why are retail chemists not allowed to import easily from abroad where a branded product may be cheaper than in the UK? Because the pharmaceutical industry is important to the economy - but only if it can sell its products.</p> <p>Let us be open about the benefits we get from drug company sponsorship while acknowledging that it must be kept in check.<br><strong>Dr Adam Moliver</strong><br>Consultant in old age psychiatry, Cheltenham, Gloucestershire </p> <p>The practice of drug companies sponsoring doctors to attend educational conferences is indeed common. However, at present, there is no viable alternative means of funding for such conferences. Training budgets for junior doctors have been dramatically reduced over recent years. Currently, junior doctors receive \u00a3500 each year to cover any courses that need to be attended. Conference fees alone can reach \u00a3500, not including travel and accommodation, so many doctors need to fund educational activities from their own pockets. </p> <p>Educational conferences are essential if we are to ensure that our doctors remain up to date with developments in their respective fields. They encourage national and international collaboration with colleagues, leading to the establishment of guidelines, clinical trials and other research projects. If the public is not comfortable with pharmaceutical companies sponsoring activities, then other means of funding need to be urgently established.<br><strong>Dr David O'Connor</strong><br>Junior doctor, Birmingham </p> <p>Transparency, yes, but if pharmaceutical industry funding adversely influences best practice in medicine, we perhaps need to understand why recent national studies funded by the NHS still find that, in general, only 10-20% of women sustaining an osteoporosis-related fracture receive treatments mandated by the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence. Many companies are active in this disease area, providing educational opportunities for doctors and nurses, even though they know that 80% of the prescriptions written will go on generic medicines.</p> <p>Perhaps the question that needs to be asked is why is the NHS not investing sufficiently in training its workforce? Many of us would love to receive better support from the NHS to present, share and hear about research advances at major medical and bio-scientific conferences, but it is just not going to happen.<br><strong>Dr Jonathan Bayly</strong><br>Associate lecturer, faculty of education health and sciences, University of Derby </p> <p>Your correspondent (Letters, August 25) claims that, \"GPs claim back from the NHS a standard price for each drug prescribed, whatever they have actually paid for it\".</p> <p>He may not realise this applies only to dispensing GP practices, whose patients live too far from a commercial pharmacy to obtain their medications. As far as I am aware, the arrangements for reimbursement through the NHS are directly equivalent to those paid to commercial pharmacies. The vast majority of GPs are non-dispensing, and have no monetary interest whatsoever in what they prescribe, other than to try to keep to cost-saving targets set by their primary care trusts. Many, like myself, have a policy of avoiding drug company-sponsored educational events, in order to avoid any influence on prescribing.<br><strong>Dr MA Lindsay</strong><br>Leeds</p>",
  "<p>As the French president Nicolas Sarkozy thrashed out a ceasefire between the Kremlin and Georgia this month, a Georgian Airways plane touched down in Tbilisi carrying a team of his fellow countrymen who have been among the first on the ground in disaster areas and war zones for the past decade.</p> <p>The charity they work for has provided a vital service for bodies from the UN and World Health Organisation to Oxfam and Save the Children and has directly helped hundreds of thousands of people caught up in earthquakes, mud slides, famines and wars.</p> <p>The French team were taking telecoms equipment into the Georgian capital. T\u00e9l\u00e9coms Sans Fronti\u00e8res (TSF) has provided a vital link for aid agencies and a lifeline to friends and relatives from Iraq and Niger to Sri Lanka and Nicaragua.</p> <p>TSF - which has no connection with the medical charity M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res - is the brainchild of former caterer Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Cazenave, whose only previous connection with the world of communications had been a brief stint with the French postal service that eventually split to form France T\u00e9l\u00e9com.</p> <p>Cazenave, transfixed by television news footage about the plight of the Kurds, got talking with a friend who worked for a British frozen foods company about how they could help.</p> <p>Ten days later, with $10,000 and 40 volunteers, they were ready to ship out clothes and other supplies in two lorries, one bound for Iran and the other heading for the Turkish border. In unmistakably French style, that first consignment also included 100,000 pieces of cheese. The trip to Kurdistan was followed by mercy missions to the Balkans the following year. But what surprised Cazenave on every trip was the reaction of the people he had come to help when it came time for the trucks to roll out again.</p> <p>\"When we left the camp they all gave us pieces of paper with a telephone number on them saying 'when you get back to France phone my friend, phone my father, phone my brother, say we are here, that their uncle is dead and that we are here and they have to help us'. That is how it began. During the war in Bosnia it was the same. In the 45 times I went there, every time we have come back from Mostar or Sarajevo and so on we had a list of people to call when we got home.\"</p> <p>He started to look into whether there were ways of setting up communications facilities into the refugee camps that had sprung up all over the Balkans and realised there was nothing.</p> <p>\"Every time we saw the same thing - there is a need for victims to be able to communicate. And all the non-governmental organisations (NGOs) also need telecommunications.\" </p> <p>So he went back to his local council with a proposal and the mayor bought Cazenave his first satellite phone.</p> <p>Now 53, the doughty Cazenave would not look out of place running a vineyard. The early days of TSF, officially started in 1998, confirms his job is a lot harder than it first appears. On one of his first outings he was threatened by an angry Albanian who put a gun to his head and the following year was taken hostage by Bosnian Serbs. </p> <p>\"Part of the problem is that I have a big mouth,\" he jokes in his heavily accented English. \"Now I am more, not relaxed, but careful about what I say.\"</p> <p>His first trip, to Albania in 1998, proved him right. He had gone out there with one satellite phone to help refugees from Bosnia.</p> <p>\"We opened our little centre, in a village school, and a load of people came. What was fantastic was that a few days later I remember seeing people arriving in cars to take away their family and we thought 'this idea is good'.\"</p> <p>When he got back, he founded TSF along with some of his former colleagues, including Monique Lanne-Petit, who remains a director.</p> <p>On one mission the following year in Macedonia, TSF had 400 people turn up to make calls the first day. Two days later there were 25,000 and a queue a mile long and the media started to take notice of the Frenchman with a satellite phone. From there the team went to Kosovo. Cazenove had 6,000 francs (\u00a3700) in his pocket and plans to stay for two weeks. He ended up staying for more than a year and by the end of it, TSF was operating under a UN mandate.</p> <p>TSF then became involved in disaster relief after the 1999 earthquake that struck Izmit in western Turkey. TSF volunteers took some of the kit from Kosovo to help out. \"It was our first intervention for a natural disaster. We stayed there for 10 days.\"</p> <p>Since then TSF has been out on more than 70 missions to 50-odd countries. It has attracted the backing of the Vodafone Group Foundation, the United Nations Foundation, the European Commission Humanitarian Office (ECHO), satellite communications groups Inmarsat, Eutelsat and Vizada, telecoms companies AT&amp;T and Cable &amp; Wireless and the Regional Council of Aquitaine. It now has 20 full-time staff and twice that number of volunteers.</p> <p>Only two countries have defeated TSF. It reluctantly pulled out of Iraq, because the queues of people waiting to use the phone could attract suicide bombers, and Burma, where the regime refused it access to the Irrawaddy delta after the cyclone hit the region this year.</p> <p>TSF has expanded its operations in recent years, not just setting up communications hubs for NGOs, but also using the latest generation of satellite phones - which provide internet and send pictures - to put people in remote areas in touch with distant medical facilities.</p> <p>In the west African state of Niger, ravaged by famine, TSF has put in place communication services in 37 locations to help the government's national food crisis prevention system. In South America it trains people in impoverished areas to use the latest IT systems.</p> <p>At its core TSF does exactly what it started out doing 10 years ago and is doing it right now in Georgia: providing vital communications to people who have lost absolutely everything.</p> <p>During that 10 years, TSF has suffered only two accidents - give or take the odd kidnapping. One volunteer was injured in Iraq and more recently one of the team in Niger contracted malaria.</p> <p>Cazenave says: \"The most dangerous thing we do is use the local equipment, like cars and helicopters. We go to poor countries and the cars are old and we drive very fast because we have to arrive very quickly.

  "<p>Your article (Watchdog fines car dealers over PPI mis-selling, August 22) proves that the payment protection insurance industry is in need of a major shake-up. For nearly 10 years, research by Which? and, more recently, the Financial Services Authority has demonstrated widespread mis-selling of PPI policies, yet consumers are still getting ripped off. While it is good to see firms being hit in the pocket for mis-selling, the FSA and the industry need to do more to stop it happening in the first place. They must take stronger action across the whole of the PPI market and make sure all sales meet the prescribed standards so that consumers are sold products that meet their needs.</p> <p>Anyone who has a personal loan, credit card or any kind of credit agreement should check if they have a PPI policy and, if they think it was mis-sold to them, consider making a complaint. Until the industry and FSA take appropriate steps to clean up the sale of PPI, consumers will continue to pay the price. <br><strong>Louise Hanson</strong><br>Head of campaigns, Which? </p> <p>Your assertion (Viewpoint, August 22) that \"there are an estimated 18m policies in circulation, most of them mis-sold\" is both unsupported and misleading. PPI allows borrowers to protect themselves against circumstances which would otherwise prevent them from repaying their loans. And it works - 80% of claims made on PPI policies sold by Finance and Leasing Association member companies are met. Discussion is best served by sticking to the facts. Otherwise, many people will choose not to protect themselves, at the worst possible time.<br><strong>Stephen Sklaroff</strong><br>Director general, Finance &amp; Leasing Association</p>",

  "<p>There is a certain familiarity about the annual publication of A-level results: the pictures of anxious teenagers opening envelopes against the background of national soul-searching over standards. In homes across the country, the winners and losers - and their families - at last know the choices they have before them. </p> <p>Since the demise of the 11-plus, it is often the first time in a student's educational life that test results have so clearly opened or closed doors.</p> <p>But things are changing. More schools, more 18-year-olds, more parents are directly affected by results day. And many candidates are not 18, but anything up to 80. Some are already in employment and have families of their own. More are seizing their second chance.</p> <p>This is very much for the better. The expansion of higher education is a sign of national strength, not weakness, and although we've failed to increase the percentage of students from poorer backgrounds significantly, the total number attending university from this group has increased, as the overall student population has grown.</p> <p>Yet there is one consequence that may be less welcome: the percentage of students living at home while studying at university has grown.</p> <p>Until the 1980s, it was pretty much expected that school-leavers going on to higher education would study away from home. Living independently was seen as part of the university experience.</p> <p>One of the first groups from the working class to unlock the doors of our great universities comprised grammar school girls and boys. Their accounts are telling. They credit their later successes as much to the people they met, the places they visited and the new social skills they acquired as to their degrees.</p> <p>Everything you learn at university - not just what you are taught in the lecture hall - raises aspirations and prepares you for the rest of your life.</p> <p>The social groups that have always had access to university still opt for the richer learning experience to be gained from studying away from home.</p> <p>But a sizeable minority of the new breed of student does not. In 1994, only 12.8% of students lived at home; by 2006, the number had risen to more than 20%. </p> <p>The majority of those staying at home come from lower socio-economic backgrounds or ethnic minorities, and they attend the new universities.</p> <p>The main reason for the change is obviously cost. Not only did the previous generation of students not have to pay for their tuition, but their board and keep were subsidised by taxpayers. </p> <p>This is, of course, not a defensible use of taxpayers' money. Yet when something is so evidently of benefit, we usually strive to make it widely available, rather than accept its decline.</p> <p>Studying away from home should be a choice for more people. And there's no real reason to restrict it to university undergraduates. Those following vocational courses should also have the opportunity to live away from home while they study.</p> <p>No matter how imaginative the funding model, the three-year experience enjoyed by undergraduates can't be replicated for everyone. But even a month at a subject Centre of Excellence or skills academy could widen the horizons of young people at the start of their careers.</p> <p>There will always be some who want or need to remain at home. But a bit of creative thinking is needed to give everyone else a real choice.</p>",
  "<p>A toddler was in a critical condition in hospital last night after his five-year-old sister shot him in the head with their father's air rifle. </p> <p>Rashid Rullah, who is 18 months old, was playing in his family's back garden in Birmingham on Sunday evening while his father, Bakht Zaman, used the gun for target practice.</p> <p>According to the boy's grandfather, Bakht Rammand, Zaman put the loaded gun down while he answered a call on his mobile. While his back was turned, his daughter picked up the gun and shot her brother. </p> <p>\"There are no words to describe it really. The whole road loves them,\" said Rammand, 48. </p> <p>He said the boy's mother, Fazilat Zaman, 25, had spent the night at Birmingham children's hospital but was later sleeping at home before returning to her son's bedside. He said his grandson remained unconscious and seriously ill in hospital after his sister, Asna Almas, shot him. </p> <p>Doctors were unable to operate on the boy as he was still unconscious, he added. </p> <p>Rammand said: \"The children usually come down here about 10.30am and spend all day, every day with us. At 4pm they usually go home. When they went home yesterday they were playing with their dad in the garden. </p> <p>\"He was target practising with the gun and then somebody rang his mobile. The gun was ready to fire and he answered the phone. </p> <p>\"Rashid's sister is really active and she got hold of the gun and pointed it at her brother. He was on the high ground and she was on the low ground. It hit him right in the middle of the back of his head. Everybody's in shock.\" </p> <p>A spokeswoman for the West Midlands ambulance service said yesterday: \"We were called to an address in Washwood Heath in Birmingham at around 6.40pm last night following reports of a child having been shot. He had suffered a serious head injury.</p> <p>\"We sent an ambulance, two rapid response vehicles, an incident support officer and West Midlands care team emergency doctors to take the child to Birmingham children's hospital. She added that the child had been admitted in a \"critical but stable\" condition.</p> <p>A spokesman for West Midlands police said: \"While we are still trying to establish precisely what happened, this does appear to be a tragic accident involving young children.</p> <p>He added: \"Officers are not seeking anyone else in connection with the incident.\"</p> <p>A neighbour, Robert Stacey, 50, said: \"Yesterday afternoon I saw the man next door doing target practice against some kind of shooting board in his back garden with an air rifle. I asked him if he was with a club and he said he was.\"</p> <p>He added: \"I have to admit I wasn't very happy at this going on next door to me because it made a loud clacking noise and I don't like having guns so nearby.\"</p> <p>Although most air weapons do not require the keeper to apply for a firearms certificate, the law controlling the sale of the weapons was recently tightened up to make it illegal to sell them to anyone under 18.</p>",
  "<p>There were green fields, old oaks and dusty country lanes, according to contemporary accounts of the decisive civil war battle of Naseby. But no one said anything about mobile phone warbles, aircraft noise or the rumble of the nearby A14.</p> <p>Which is why the English countryside round the battlefield in Northamptonshire has lost out on three lucrative months of filming a period drama about King Charles I's defeat by Cromwell in 1645.</p> <p>Producers of the TV epic The Devil's Whore say that they have found a \"more realistic\" equivalent of 17th-century rural England 6,000 miles away in the wine-growing Stellenbosch region of South Africa. \"It's much more affordable to film there,\" said Liza Marshall, the controller of drama at Channel 4, which has commissioned the four-parter for screening in Britain this autumn. \"And we discovered an area where the countryside just looks similar to England, with oak trees and other familiar locations.\"</p> <p>The switch has been condemned by Northamptonshire county council and local civil war re-enactment societies, which rate Naseby highly, with its wild cavalry charge by the royalist leader Prince Rupert of the Rhine.</p> <p>John Kemp, a 36-year-old officer in the English Civil War Society, called the decision \"bizarre\". He said: \"There may be issues with cost and the odd telegraph pole in the background, but surely with the technology they have and a bit of camera work this wouldn't be a problem.\"</p> <p>However, Martin Evans, the deputy chairman of the Naseby Battlefield Project, said the landscape had changed too much. He said: \"Fields have been enclosed, railways built, the English landscape has been completely transformed.\"</p>",
  "<p>In the year before he died, Beethoven somehow constructed in the silence of his mind a fiendishly difficult string quartet, the Grosse Fuge. (He was by then unable to hear anything he composed.) Shakespeare, in the last of the plays that academic posterity will unambiguously attribute to him, brought together themes of paternal loss and creative decline in The Tempest. Philip Larkin, fearing that poetry had given him up after the publication of what would prove to be his final collection, focused his concentration to deliver just one more major poem, Aubade, distilling his terror of death.</p> <p>These are all pieces the critics would categorise as late work: words or music in which an artist combines a lifetime of experience with the technique perfected through a long career to offer a climactic contribution to the art form they have served. But check the dates and you'll find that Beethoven, Shakespeare and Larkin were just either side of 50 when they committed their last thoughts. Increasingly, by contemporary standards, the Grosse Fuge, The Tempest and Aubade would stand as transitional works of middle age.</p> <p>This week, PD James publishes her latest crime novel, The Private Patient, at the age of 88. And she is not the oldest author in the autumn lists: former Booker prize winner Stanley Middleton, 89 this month, has just published Her Three Wise Men. But James and Middleton are more or less adolescents in comparison with Elliott Carter, who this summer became the first living composer to be granted a centenary concert at the BBC Proms. Carter is still composing at an age when most people are doing the opposite: this year's celebrations included a new flute concerto, and two more pieces are said to be in preparation.</p> <p>In pop and rock, long regarded as a business for the young and one in which there has been a sentimental respect for early death, the best reviews of the year for live performance have been shared by Leonard Cohen, 73, and Neil Diamond, 67. The nervous showbusiness tradition of performers pretending to be younger than they are - fearful of seeming like the parents of their fans - may soon be reversed, with rookie musicians shifting their birth dates backwards, like army volunteers.</p> <p>It can seem ungallant to make a song and dance about the age at which people are still singing and dancing. It's wise to be wary of Queen Mother syndrome, the process by which, in a famous figure's final years, almost any evidence of undamaged faculties is met with cries of: \"Aren't they amazing? At their age!\" But there has been a marked change in the traditional trajectory of an artistic career. The general increase in longevity bestowed by medical developments has combined with a growing respect for professional veterans, to create a new genre: very late work.</p> <p>What makes these pieces intriguing is the expectation of an even more concentrated expression of the values traditionally attributed to late work: a deeper accumulation of history, wisdom, expertise. It's the same impulse that leads local museums to interview senior members of their communities for oral history projects. The Tempest is a good example of this kind of end-of-career piece. The play demonstrates Shakespeare's poetic maturity and hard-learned stagecraft and, in the moment when the magician Prospero breaks and jettisons the tools of his trade, encourages us to take this as the closest we will ever get to a memoir from an irritatingly invisible author.</p> <p>These conventional expectations of late work - the serenity of seniority, the perfection of a philosophy - have been challenged by the literary critic Edward Said in his influential book On Late Style (2002). Said, a dedicated contrarian, argued that what made autumnal culture most interesting was not that the writer had come to some kind of final understanding of their world and their work, but that they had failed to do so. Career codas such as Beethoven's Grosse Fuge or Missa Solemnis - dark, dense, dragged out of deafness - were a statement, he argued, of \"intransigence, difficulty and unresolved contradiction\".</p> <p>As Said freely acknowledged, his interest in this subject came partly from the knowledge that his own book would rank among his late work: he had begun the lecture programme that inspired it following the diagnosis of leukaemia, which killed him in 2003, at the age of 67. On Late Style is itself an example of the kind of final writing that the volume approvingly cites. Said's theories about creativity in its fading days are difficult, intransigent and sometimes contradictory.</p> <p>But his views are illuminating when it comes to very late work - in particular, PD James's work of her 88th year. Baroness James of Holland Park has worked in a conservative literary tradition - the classic English detective mystery - and, in that sense, is the kind of artist to whom Said would least have warmed. In some ways, The Private Patient, her 19th novel, does fit the sentimental template of stories that sit towards the end of a writer's bookshelf: there are several reflections on the unstoppable passage of time, the finality of death and the consolation of relationships. However, even so late in the day, James - like Said's Beethoven - also struggles against the subjects and structures with which she works.</p> <p>For example, for the first time in her books, she explicitly and graphically describes the moment of death from the perspective of the murder victim. This passage suggests an attempt to make the fullest possible engagement with the ultimate crime that has been her great theme. There is also little that is serene and accepting in the atmosphere of this book. Christian religious faith, a recurrent touchstone for James's characters, seems in The Private Patient no more than a comforting ritual: a suicide takes place on holy ground, and James's sentiments throughout feel closer to the atheistic philosophy of Philip Larkin - \"what will survive of us is love\" - than any sense that the many corpses in her story are happy in paradise. Nor is there any comforting dispensation of justice, of the sort that Commander Adam Dalgleish easily achieved in his early cases. Key issues remain, to borrow a favourite Said word, unresolved. </p> <p>Stanley Middleton is another author who works in a traditional form - \"well-made\" novels about the provincial middle classes - and his very late novels find him worrying away at the literary and social values that have informed his work. There is also the feeling of absolutely authentic reportage of the experience of being old in a culture biased towards youth: the experiences of illness, bereavement, pensions and insurance bureaucracy. When, in a recent novel, Middleton featured a character with Alzheimer's, there was a moving sense of a report being sent back from a massacre by one of the few to escape.</p> <p>Of course, there can be weaknesses in the novels of advanced seniority. The younger characters in both James and Middleton speak an English improbably free of swearing and text abbreviations; and the prevalence in James's books of unmarried brothers and sisters who share houses perhaps marks her as an Edwardian, born in a period when such living arrangements were rather more common. But, at their best, these books offer the pleasure of writers completely at ease with their craft, and still urgently concerned with life and society. </p> <p>What's especially impressive about James is her continuing energy. Whereas Graham Greene's later works were eccentric novellas - a classic example of the tendency of climactic creativity towards fragments - The Private Patient alternates numerous viewpoints over 400 pages. Commending James for such productivity, however, again raises one of the risks of very late work: the tendency to praise the existence of the work rather than its content. At the centenary concerts for Elliott Carter, there was a feeling that concert-goers who would instinctively dislike his complex and edgy compositions were simply applauding his longevity. And yet Carter represents the fascinating contradiction of a modernist centenarian - an old artist still interested in newness.</p> <p>In the same way, anyone who went to see Leonard Cohen or Neil Diamond this year in some mood of patronising surprise at their ability to keep going would soon have realised that the prevailing spirit of these performances was not heritage conservation but reinvention and experimentation. Although both performed many old numbers, the point was what they brought to them now, after periods of personal difficulties in both cases.</p> <p>The usual objection to singers in the final phase of their careers has been that their voices go. During the final tours of Frank Sinatra and Nina Simone, audiences had to fight an instinct to shout out for an ear, nose or throat surgeon in the house. But what's fascinating about Cohen in particular is that, if his voice has gone, it has simply gone to another place - and, probably, a better one. Listening to Cohen's 1970s and 80s recordings after seeing him perform in Dublin and London this year, I was surprised to find that what had once seemed definitive recordings of Hallelujah and Suzanne felt somehow light and trivial. Now that he has taken the sensible precautions of giving up smoking and taking up yoga, there is a remarkable combination of gravity and clarity in Cohen's tones.</p> <p>Admittedly, it's hard to imagine the singers continuing for as long as the novelists and the composers - Diamond or Cohen with guitars slung round their necks at the age of 88 or 89 - but a society in which the ageing often feel marginalised or ignored seems to be redressing the balance in culture.

  "<p>Sam Vokes has come a long way in a short time since we walked out of the changing room at Bournemouth together for our first day's training - mine with the club and his with the first team. He was understandably overawed and still pinching himself that he had been elevated from the youth team at such an early age.</p> <p>He very quickly established himself in the side and it was with great interest that I watched him many times after, the latest as a substitute with his new club, Wolverhampton Wanderers, in the first game of the season at Plymouth Argyle when he came off the bench and scored a crucial goal to earn his side a draw.</p> <p>He is a big lad, standing over 6ft tall and weighing nearly 14st, but surprising defenders with the speed at which he covers ground, particularly chasing lost causes and closing the opposition down when they think they have more time on the ball than they actually do.</p> <p>He is a forward who loves to play up against his opponent, particularly in and around the box, where he can get a sense of what is around him simply by knowing that the defender is touch-tight. He has a nice touch all over the pitch that is improving all the time and there is also a natural progression with the quality and timing of his decision-making, which is also getting better with experience.</p> <p>He needs information from team-mates, as do most people when they receive the ball with their back to play, particularly in the middle of the pitch, as once or twice against Plymouth he tried to get rid of the ball a little bit too early or flicked things on when defenders had already dropped off him.</p> <p>He knows when to get involved in the build-up play and when to concentrate on making sure that when a ball comes into the box he has an opportunity of scoring. As well as being dominant in the air he is not a bad finisher for someone so inexperienced, proven by the 12 goals he scored in his first season at Bournemouth, even though the team were relegated from League One.</p> <p>He already has a very rounded look to his game and there were no real weaknesses that stood out apart from perhaps a left foot that could be worked on. But knowing him as a person, ironing out the creases will not be a problem.</p> <p>Such is the impression he has made that he has already been called into the Wales Under-21 squad 10 times, scoring four goals, the first of which took him 36 seconds on his debut against Northern Ireland in February 2006 (I told you he wasn't slow). Vokes qualifies for Wales through his grandfather and has since received two full caps for the senior side. </p> <p>He is someone most people would enjoy playing with as there is a real honesty and simplicity to his game - and I mean that in a good way - that makes him easy to read for his team-mates. He is also very useful in defensive areas, particularly from dead-ball situations, because he is able to compete with anyone decent in the air from the opposition, which is something we tend to overlook from centre-forwards.</p> <p>Whatever happens to Sam in the future, I would like to think that deep down just a small part of him will remember and hold on to that excited feeling he had about the game the first day he walked down to the training pitch with me. If he does, then like myself, he will never forget what a lucky and privileged life we footballers lead, and this will do him no harm at all.</p> <p><strong>Age </strong>18</p> <p><strong>Born</strong> Southampton</p> <p><strong>Position </strong> Centre-forward</p> <p><strong>Height </strong>6ft 1in </p> <p><strong>Weight</strong> 13st 10lb</p> <p><strong>From </strong>AFC<strong> </strong>Bournemouth</p> <p><strong>Awareness </strong>7/10 </p> <p><strong>Heading </strong>9/10</p> <p><strong>Shooting </strong>8/10</p> <p><strong>Pace </strong>8/10</p> <p><strong>Team responsibility</strong> 8/10</p> <p><strong>Valuation</strong> \u00a3750,000</p>",
  "<p>It was in this very room that I stripped down to my boxer shorts and pleaded with her,\" Keiron Cunningham grins shyly as he looks around an executive box at the famous old home of St Helens. The strapping rugby league hooker actually blushes at the memory of his near-naked beseeching.</p> <p>\"She had the calipers out and was measuring every inch of my body - here at good old Knowsley Road,\" Cunningham says. \"I was trying to convince her to give me bigger biceps and a bit of a six-pack but it wasn't going to plan. That's when it might have sounded like I was begging but she pointed out that an artist needs integrity. I was impressed by that so I let her get on with it and I'm thrilled now. There might be no six-pack, sadly, but the rest looks unbelievable. It's a massive honour to be immortalised in bronze and to still be breathing. Normally you have to be dead and buried before anybody puts up a statue of you.\"</p> <p>The result of Cunningham's revealing encounter with a sculptor appointed by St Helens borough council will finally be unveiled when the club move to a purpose-built stadium on Merseyside in the next few years. It will be worth the wait, for he deserves the lasting memorial to him that will be erected right outside the ground. As a staunchly loyal home-town player and arguably the most consistent performer over the 12-year history of Super League, he is almost without peer in the modern sporting world where big-money transfers and a swaggering escape from the grassroots define the life of the usual star.</p> <p>Cunningham is different. He might be preparing for his eighth Challenge Cup final on Saturday, when he will captain his beloved Saints against lowly Hull at Wembley, but the diffident if physically imposing forward prefers to express pride in local achievements. \"Rugby league is massive here. I know it's a cliche but it's also true when people say league is like a religion in St Helens. We're just this little town in Merseyside but, thanks to rugby, we're on the world map. </p> <p>\"I know how far we've come because I'm a St Helens lad. I stood on those <br>terraces as a fan. I know what it's like to get hammered by your local rivals. I can't tell you how many sad afternoons I spent watching Wigan hammering us. But we're on top now and to be part of that is amazing. It started to sink in when they began talking about building a stadium, to accommodate the growth of our club, and that the local council planned to erect a statue outside this spanking new ground.\"</p> <p>The 31-year-old bruiser jokes that his extended family might have rigged the vote set up by the council to identify St Helens' most symbolic rugby hero. \"It was surreal. We were on holiday in America and my wife's sister rang to tell us about this website vote. To hear that my name was on a list of St Helens legends with Tom van Vollenhoven and Alex Murphy was a shock. And when they announced later that I'd won I tried to act dead casual. I said: 'Oh, I never followed the voting.' But I'll tell you a secret. That was a lie.\"</p> <p>He cackles in delight. \"We'd go down to internet cafes in America a few times a day - me and the kids - to check the website. It was really exciting. Tom was in the lead at the start but then the kids got to work, clicking away, and I steadily took over. I had an unfair advantage because I've also got 10 brothers and sisters and thousands of relatives who were voting for me. But, yeah, in the end I won convincingly.\"</p> <p>Cunningham polled more than 10,000 votes and he concedes that not all of them were cast by his family. A large chunk of his support was due not only to his longevity or exemplary option-taking as a player, illustrated best by his trademark close-range try-scoring, but to a decision he took six years ago. Pursued by Clive Woodward for England and Graham Henry for Wales, he was on the verge of switching to union in 2002. </p> <p>\"I was this close to signing for Wales,\" he says, closing the gap between his thumb and index finger to a millimetre. \"I had a contract from the Welsh Rugby Union and I was literally minutes from putting pen to paper. But something didn't feel quite right. I followed my heart in the end but there were sour grapes from the Welsh union. A press conference, unveiling me and Iestyn Harris at the Millennium Stadium, was set for the Tuesday but we had one at St Helens on the Monday, announcing that I was staying with the club. I was disappointed that the WRU then spread all these doubts about my family and heritage - but it could have been handled better by both parties.\"</p> <p>He hesitates when asked if, like Andy Farrell, he might have struggled to make the same impact in union. \"My ego tells me, of course you would've been as good, but my head says many great players struggled after switching codes. I'm still good friends with Andy and it's tough to see him looking out of sorts. Jason Robinson stands out as the exception but outside-halves and full-backs have more chance of making the transition. It's tougher for forwards and centres because, defensively, it's so different.</p> <p>\"I wouldn't say that there are absolutely no regrets because I might have won a couple of Welsh grand slams, which would've been fantastic. But there was always that element of doubt so it probably suited my personality to stay with league.\"</p> <p>There are many compensations, not least this season because Saints, in the midst of a 20-match winning streak, are on course for the double. With the influence of Cunningham and another inspirational stalwart in Sean Long, the club are big on gnarled experience as well as youthful verve in the shape of James Graham and their alternate hooker James Roby, who won the Man of Steel last season. </p> <p>An accusation, doubling as the ultimate sign of respect, has recently emerged, for Saints are charged with being \"bad\" for the game because their superiority has turned rugby league into a procession. The reigning Super League champions, Leeds, might have some say in deciding the destination of this year's title but it is difficult to imagine St Helens' hold on the Challenge Cup being threatened by a team who currently lie second last in the table. \"Hull have a knack of playing really well against us,\" Cunningham argues, \"and we only beat them by a point earlier this season. I also know that for the last month they've done nothing but prepare for this game. It could be fascinating.\" </p> <p>The real fascination, however, will centre on the chances of Cunningham, in his penultimate season, finally winning the Lance Todd trophy for a man-of-the-match performance in the final. It remains mildly mystifying that, after winning the Challenge Cup six times in seven finals, he has never lifted the Lance Todd - in the same bizarre fashion that he has never won the Man of Steel for player of the season.</p> <p>\"I'd give up any Lance Todd or Man of Steel for another trophy with Saints. But don't get me wrong, I would love to win one of them or even both,\" he says. \"James Graham has been outstanding and a few other players are in with a shout for Man of Steel. But my form has been good and if I did win it this season I'd feel I've deserved it.\"</p> <p>One of his brothers, Eddie, won the Lance Todd in 1982, when Cunningham was only five, but the youngest in such a large family can find consolation in his own personal statue. \"I might not have a Lance Todd or a Man of Steel but at least I can say I'm now a Man of Bronze. The main thing is that my kids are so proud. </p> <p>\"My little boy's a tough nut and he's playing good rugby at the age of 11. My daughter's 14 and she's more into fashion. I sometimes take her into Wigan to the posh new clothes shop they've got there. The last time I did that was on the day after we hammered Wigan at their place and I was getting all these looks. I only worked out what was going on when we got back to the car park and this old feller said: 'I'm glad you're leaving.' I said: 'Why?' He looked at me like I were crazy and said: 'After what you pissing did to us last night.' </p> <p>\"I realised then that Saints had become the new Wigan of rugby league. It's massive to have reached that level - and the statue tops it off. I could see the pride in my kids' eyes when I told them about it. For them to now have their dad cast in bronze goes beyond words. That means more to us than anything.\"</p>",
  "<p>Europe's motor industry is still a long way from meeting EU targets for cutting carbon dioxide emissions from new cars and governments must increase pressure on carmakers to comply, green transport campaigners warned yesterday.</p> <p>Transport &amp; Environment (T&amp;E), a pan-European lobby group, accused the industry of fighting tooth and nail - with government support - to water down the proposed EU emission limits.</p> <p>T&amp;E said the 14 top carmakers in the European market still had to cut engine emissions by 17% to reach the EU's 2012 target of 130 grams a kilometre.</p> <p>Its new study, which is based on official data supplied to the European commission, provides scant evidence that European consumers are switching en masse to low-emission, more fuel-efficient cars.</p> <p>However, Jos Dings, T&amp;E director, said that some manufacturers were showing signs of responding to the threat of increased regulation, with German carmaker BMW cutting emissions from its fleet by an average 7.3% in 2007 through its \"efficient dynamics\" programme.</p> <p>\"With the threat of legislation looming, BMW has shown that even premium carmakers can seriously reduce CO2. But the slow response of most carmakers shows that the EU needs to keep up the pressure with challenging long-term CO2 targets,\" Dings said. T&amp;E wants an emissions target of 80g/km for all new cars by 2020 against the 158g achieved last year. In its drive to make the EU the world's first low-carbon economy, the commission has proposed that CO2 emissions from new cars be cut to 130g/km by 2012, with a further 10g reduction to come from alternative fuels. Targets for carmakers vary according to the weight of the average vehicle produced.</p> <p>Carbon emissions from transport in the EU increased by 35% between 1990 and 2006 and account for 28% of all emissions with cars responsible for half of these.</p> <p>But after ferocious lobbying from the German car industry, the chancellor, Angela Merkel, struck a deal this summer with French president Nicolas Sarkozy for the target reductions in car emissions to be phased in until 2015. They also agreed to water down the penalties for breaching the emissions limit.</p> <p>Urging EU governments to retain the targets and penalties, Dings said: \"German carmakers want CO2 targets to apply only to the cleanest cars in the early years. It's like demanding that smoking ban should apply initially only to non-smokers.\"</p> <p>The T&amp;E figures, which are the most up-to-date, show French groups Peugeot-Citro\u00ebn and Renault closest to reaching the proposed limits but still falling 10% and 14% short respectively, with Italy's Fiat close behind. Three Japanese firms - Nissan, Mazda and Suzuki - are among the four with the biggest gap to make up. </p> <p>The T&amp;E findings are published before debates on the legislation in European parliament's industry and environment committees next month. The auto industry lobby had drafted the amendments tabled by sympathetic MEPs, Dings said.</p> <p>Caroline Lucas, Green MEP and environment committee member, said the T&amp;E figures were \"disastrous\" and accused other MEPs and governments of blocking at every turn efforts to impose more ambitious targets.</p>",
  "<p>As the Democratic convention got under way, at least three tornadoes touched down in or near Denver, accompanied by thunder and spectacular lightning - proof, surely, that God hates liberals, although maybe he was simply expressing aesthetic objections to some of the extraordinarily tacky Obama merchandise for sale on every street corner. A tiny number of John McCain-branded goods were also available, in the interests of balance. At its main stage in downtown Denver, the news network MSNBC was distributing the most ill-conceived merchandise of the convention so far: nonpartisan t-shirts featuring both Obama and McCain. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> All eyes will be on Obama's running-mate Joe Biden when he addresses the convention tomorrow night. Or at least they will for the first hour or three: the Delaware senator has a famous tendency to ramble. The Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen once gently criticised this loquaciousness in a column, prompting a phone message from Biden, who thanked him for making the point, which he acknowledged was a fair one, although then again, he said, he did have his reasons for speaking at such length, but yes, it was probably a legitimate criticism, and that - at which point Cohen's answering machine cut him off.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> A big truck is making its way through the streets of Denver, all day, every day, urging people to \"Vote Libertarian!\". They won't, of course: almost everyone here's a Democrat, implacably opposed to the Libertarian argument that pretty much all taxation is supremely evil unless, possibly, it's being used to fund a strong military. Under a zero-taxation libertarian administration, of course, there'd presumably be no streets for such a truck to drive down. But we can cross that bridge when we come to it. Which we won't, owing to the lack of streets.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Yesterday night at the convention was all about Barack Obama's family - his wife, his half-sister and his brother-in-law were all scheduled to appear - but someone was missing: George Hussein Onyango Obama, one of his half-brothers, who lives in Kenya. Republicans in Texas released an ad yesterday that railed against the nominee for allowing his relative to live in squalor: \"If Barack cares so much about your family,\" it asks, \"why doesn't he take care of his family first?\" Awkwardly, though, George Obama isn't staying on message. \"Here [in Kenya],\" he told a reporter recently, \"I am surrounded by friends and family and feel safe and secure.\"</p>",
  "<p>Matthew Bourne's show takes Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray and sets it in the contemporary fashion industry. A good-looking young waiter becomes the face of a new fragrance, Immortality. Then we follow his descent into drugs, gay orgies and cosmetic surgery, all brilliantly portrayed through dance. There's no decaying portrait in his attic, but by the end of the show the \"Immortality\" billboard has become a \"Mortality\" billboard, ripped and torn and horrible.</p> <p>It's an extreme take on life in the fashion industry, but there is truth in it. I love my job and I love the industry, but it has a dark side. I'm a clean-living family man, but I know that kind of excessive behaviour goes on - though in my experience fashion is a very heterosexual industry, and in the show it was mostly homosexual. Photographers tend to be straight guys: the old cliche of photographers sleeping with female models is true. It doesn't happen so much between photographers and male models, probably just because there are fewer of them. In modelling, it's 10 girls for every guy. </p> <p>Technically, the performance was absolutely superb, and the actual photography was very accurate - though it was strange to see a photographer dancing around the studio while he's taking his shots. The billboard photos were great, too - stripped-down black-and-white shots, like an early Calvin Klein campaign.</p> <p>In real life, many fashion photographers have a reputation as prima donnas who treat models like objects, and that came across strongly in the show. Naturally, I exonerate myself from that. But then I don't dance around when I'm shooting, either.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Stephen Kearney is a fashion photographer.

  "<h2>Oh! What a lovely war we've started</h2> <p>It was a case of the \"home edders\" v the sceptics. Our cover story last week - <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/aug/19/schools.education\">No school like home</a> - provoked a battle between staunch advocates of home education and traditionalists who insisted a classroom was a better place to learn than a lounge.</p> <p>The article looked at research that claimed home education can be an \"astonishingly efficient\" alternative to school. </p> <p>And, on education.theguardian.com, the knives were out - first from home education's defenders.</p> <p>\"Earthtracer1\" wrote: \"Until more than a few decide to stop pandering to the profitable establishment business that is modern schooling, we are unlikely to see the changes required [to our education system].\"</p> <p>\"Nefertare\" agreed. \"If I want my children to have the education I think they deserve, I'll be teaching most of it to them,\" he wrote.</p> <p>It wasn't long before some readers felt compelled to remind the home educators what their children were missing out on.</p> <p>\"MarjuaLimon\" wrote: \"I had classmates of all kinds, all types of people from all types of backgrounds, not people [chosen] by my parents among a cosy group they considered suitable.\"</p> <p>And \"Hellojed\", a teacher, said: \"It's obvious that some children would benefit far more from being educated in a home, real-life context; equally, there are some children you wouldn't dream of educating in a home setting.\"</p> <p>What about the practicalities? asked \"Superburger\". \"How do home-schooled children learn science without access to laboratories or supplies?\"</p> <p>To which \"Aspiegirl\" replied: \"If I remember rightly, at my old school the Bunsen burners were mainly used for setting fire to girls' ponytails and the sulphuric acid was used to murder the tadpoles.\"</p> <p>Game, set and match to the home educators.

Even we so-called Muslim experts need to expand our understanding. Instead of just accepting the subjective view from my background, for instance, one of my tutors has lent me books by mainstream, non-Muslim academics on subjects like Islamic family law.\"</p> <p>\"I feel that this course is the only one of its kind that deals with Muslims in societies where they're in a majority as well as a minority,\" says Muhammad Anwar, one of four highly qualified academics able to provide Ahmed with one-to-one tuition. (There are other students, but they're taking one or two modules rather than the whole MA.) Anwar is research professor in Warwick's Centre for Research in Ethnic Relations (Crer) and one-time head of research at the Commission for Racial Equality.</p> <p>\"I've known him since 1999, when we were both speaking at the Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies,\" Ahmed confides. \"But that doesn't stop him putting me through it when we meet at Warwick,\" he adds with a grin. \"It can be quite brutal.\"</p> <p>Despite the ongoing threat of home-grown terrorism, Ahmed declares himself \"very optimistic\" for Britain's third-generation Muslims - substantial numbers of whom have embraced education and are making their presence felt in a wide range of professions. \"The chaplain at a top university like Warwick tells me that there are at least 1,000 Muslim students,\" he says. \"They can't all be foreign-born.\"<br><strong>Chris Arnot</strong></p> <h2>What we learned this week</h2> <p><strong>Our weekly round-up</strong><br>On the global stage, this year's Shanghai Jiao Tong rankings of research universities confirmed the dominance of American institutions, with plucky little Britain hanging in for silver.

  "<p>The BBC's just-screened, rave-reviewed drama House of Saddam was billed as an ensemble piece but it was obviously going to triumph or be trashed on the strength of one role: the dictator himself. And the reviews for this character were effusive: critics described the performance as \"transfixing\", \"bombastic\" and \"unnervingly charismatic\". He was the main reason viewers kept tuning in to the four-part television series about the Iraqi ruler. Everybody just loved the BBC's Saddam.</p> <p>\"The minute I heard about it, I knew that I and no one else would play him,\" says the Israeli actor Igal Naor. It's a curious sense of conviction, because when the BBC was casting for the role, Naor was virtually unknown outside Israel. True, he had appeared in the 2005 blockbuster film Munich, in which he played one of the Black September gunmen blown up by Mossad agents to avenge the assassination of 11 Israeli Olympian athletes. But his screen time was, by his own reckoning, \"less than five minutes - you know, the Mossad works quickly.\" </p> <p>Naor, who says he always dreamed of playing Saddam Hussein, contacted the BBC series' casting director and received no response. Then he emailed photos of himself sporting a swiftly improvised, sticky-taped-on block moustache and kefiyeh head scarf. \"Within less than an hour they called and asked how soon I could be in London.\" </p> <p>It's not just the on-screen resemblance that made Naor a stunning Saddam. Dominating every frame, the actor conveyed with his very presence the bone-chilling, cultish charisma of the Iraqi dictator who ruled by bloody, ideologically-convinced terror. Neither was it a case of copycat acting. </p> <p>\"I wasn't interested in recreating his every gesture and I didn't impersonate Saddam's voice, which was very high-pitched, like Kermit the Frog.\" He does a flash impression of Saddam talking, a nasal, drawling Arabic that instantly turns heads in the sedate Tel Aviv cafe where we are sitting. </p> <p>His portrayal of the Iraqi ruler is \"beyond acting, it's just being,\" says Naor. \"I am him, and he is me.\" What, he is Saddam? \"Yes. I won't kill you, but it's me,\" he says. \"You don't find many opportunities to play someone that you know is you, perfectly you. The soul, the essence, we share it, me and him. I was astonished to realise that, but playing him, I felt that everything he did was exactly what I would do if I were in his place.\" We are talking about the ruthless dictator, torturer and murderer of thousands, including close friends, long-time colleagues and family-in-law? \"I understood him perfectly,\" says Naor. \"It is something that is connected with childhood, with pains that you have in your first years.\" </p> <p>Similarities between the two men's childhoods are not glaringly obvious. Saddam's father abandoned him, and his abusive stepfather forced him to leave the family home, aged 10, and live with his uncle. Naor was born in 1958 in Givatayim, a well-heeled suburb of Tel Aviv. His Iraqi-Jewish parents migrated from Baghdad in the early 1950s, soon after the creation of Israel (they were \"strongly encouraged\" to drop their original, Arabic family name and adopt the Hebrew Naor). Naor describes a happy childhood home, but relates that he grew up in \"strange conditions\". During early toddler years he was raised by his grandmother - like any Iraqi child, he says - while his parents worked. As a result, his mother tongue is Arabic and he didn't speak a word of Hebrew when he first attended nursery school. </p> <p>\"Iraqi grandmothers are obsessively clean and so I always wanted to wash my hands at kindergarten,\" recalls Naor. \"I'd say it in Arabic and nobody would understand. One day I must have just kept asking, nagging, and they got fed up and locked me in the toilet, and I stood on the seat shouting through the window, [In Arabic] 'Granny, granny, come and get me!'\" </p> <p>He grew up feeling different. \"I thought, I don't speak the language, I don't belong to you ... and life is a fight, a struggle and you have to change the world,\" he says. \"Sometimes you realise that the biggest revolutionaries just wanted to change something in their childhood that was painful - and Saddam was a socialist revolutionary in the beginning. He did many great things for his country at first, like building a health system, education and nationalising oil revenues. And then he took the country to war with Iran and destroyed everything.\"</p> <p>Naor's Saddam comprised a dimension of the Iraqi dictator as a victim of geo-politics: a classic tragic hero. The series ending, which closed on Saddam moments before his hanging, managed to evince some sympathy for the dictator, hunted down, found hiding in a hole and executed for crimes against humanity. \"When you hear his name, you immediately, instinctively connect it with evil, a murderer, craziness, and so on,\" he says. \"If I played him only as that, I would just be fulfilling people's expectations and that's not interesting.\" The Iraqi ruler clearly came over as a brutal tyrant in the series. \"My role was to build tension between the intention of the writers and my own performance,\" says Naor. \"So, as Saddam, I believe every word I say, and I believe every terrible thing I do is for the good of the nation and every mistake I make is because I can't do things in any other way, because of who I am. That's the duty of any actor playing any role, but especially this role where there is so much prejudice.\" </p> <p>While the BBC was scouting for a Saddam, Naor was on location for last year's film Rendition, in which he plays the Arab torturer-interrogator hired by the CIA to deal with terror suspects that the organisation has \"disappeared\" to a secret detention facility somewhere in the Middle East. He is currently working on Green Zone, a big-budget thriller inspired by the book Imperial Life in the Emerald City, Rajiv Chandrasekaran's expos\u00e9 of the US-controlled zone of Baghdad as an enclave of luxury and ignorance. In the film, due for release next year, Naor plays a politically ambiguous Iraqi general chased by American agents who are trying, post-2003 invasion, to find evidence of WMDs. </p> <p>Both films raise bold questions over western policy in the Middle East and Naor's own sentiments echo that. He thinks that blanket US support gives Israel licence not to do anything \"to solve the problem with our brothers the Palestinians, the biggest problem in the Middle East\". He talks about present-day Iraq, where the American administration \"just doesn't care. They only care about their interests. And the people are paying the price, with their blood.\" A communist since he was a teenager, Naor is decidedly anti-imperialist. \"I was born in a period of ideology. I never liked capitalism. I don't like people who think they can invade a country to change the regime or to kill the elected leader,\" he says. \"You are not the judge and not the police of the world. Who asked you? And how dare you? And what do you understand about it, anyway?\" </p> <p>By his own admission, Naor's concern for Iraq goes deeper than the compassion he feels for human suffering, anywhere. \"My blood, my mentality is Iraqi,\" he says, pronouncing the country with a strong guttural \"Q\" just like his BBC Saddam. \"I really know the western game well and I play it,\" he says. \"But I felt at home when I was filming in Morocco and Tunisia. I speak the language; I like the food, the Araq [aniseed drink], the nargile [hookah]. Me and my Iraqi friends [in Israel] talk only in Arabic when we are together. We enjoy it - there is a lot of humour and nuances that we can never express in Hebrew.\" Among those friends are the Iraqi-Israeli actors Sasson Gabai and Uri Gavriel, who both featured in the House of Saddam. </p> <p>In his home country, Naor is better known as a stage actor, having played countless lead roles spanning more than two decades in theatre. He is still remembered for roles in classic productions performed years ago. He is due to return to theatre later in the year, schedule permitting. Does he worry about being stereotyped as the Arab movie villain? \"I don't talk in terms of goodies and baddies,\" he says. \"I won't do roles that are just 'an Arab' with nothing interesting about it. I also just turned down a big role because the script was anti-Israeli, it was coming from a place of hatred.\" </p> <p>Despite the array of \"very nice\" roles he is offered these days, he does not think that he has achieved global stature. \"It is not an international career,\" he says. \"There is currently a wave of Middle Eastern films and it will pass. Anyway, my days of big dreams are behind me - I am 50; for an Iraqi that is beyond retirement!\".</p>",
  "<p>'The only thing better than singing is more singing,\" said Ella Fitzgerald. Perhaps such a statement is to be expected from a world-famous artist with an era-defining voice, but she wasn't the only one to wax lyrical on the benefits of a good vocal performance. \"He who sings frightens away his ills,\" said Cervantes. Even John Harvey Kellogg - Mr Cornflakes himself - had this to add in 1931: \"Singing promotes health, breathing, circulation and digestion.\" </p> <p>Singing might be fun, might be joyful and uplifting, might inspire poetry and paeans. But could it actually be good for you? Oh yes. It seems that Kellogg was on to something. </p> <p>Singing is also in fashion at the moment. BBC1's Last Choir Standing has taken it on to Saturday-night television, while this month the Sing The Nation project organised a programme of group singing events around the country that culminated in a nationwide singalong on August 24 to mark the Olympic handover from Beijing to London. </p> <p>Last year, the government announced \u00a340m of funding in the National Singing Programme to get every primary-school pupil singing regularly. And there are, apparently, now more choirs in this country than there are fish and chips shops. </p> <p>But there is also an increasing interest in the physical, psychological and emotional benefits of singing. In December of this year, the charity Heart Research UK will run a Sing for Your Heart week to raise money and also to highlight the health benefits of singing. And in September the Sidney De Haan Research Centre for Arts and Health at Canterbury Christ Church University will host a conference to explore the role of music and singing in health, social care and community development.</p> <p>The Sidney De Haan centre undertakes research and provides evidence to support their aim of getting the NHS to provide \"singing on prescription\". Professor Grenville Hancox, director of music at the university and co-director of the centre, says, \"We are convinced that it is a powerful tool. Research we've just done involving international choirs and over 12,000 people identified several particular benefits of regular group singing, including specific examples of people who say it helped them recover from strokes or heart attacks.\" </p> <p>The research available on singing identifies some key physical benefits. It exercises major muscle groups in the upper body. It is an aerobic activity that improves the efficiency of your cardiovascular system and encourages you to take more oxygen into your body, leading to increased alertness.</p> <p>Aerobic activity is linked to stress reduction, longevity and better overall health. Improved airflow in the upper respiratory tract is likely to lessen the opportunity for bacteria to flourish there, countering the symptoms of colds and flu. Singing also aids the development of motor control and coordination, and recent studies have shown that it improves neurological functioning. </p> <p>But the benefits of singing extend beyond the fizzing of synapses and the whizzing of oxygenated blood cells. \"There is an increasing appreciation that the way people feel about themselves is going to have an impact on the budgets of the NHS,\" says Hancox. </p> <p>\"If people are content they are less likely to encounter physical problems.\" He points out that feeling better through song is not a new discovery. \"There is evidence to suggest that in their infirmaries, monks used to sing to each other as part of the healing process. And other cultures use singing constantly as a means to live.\"</p> <p>There is nothing like singing for generating that feelgood factor. \"It's almost indescribable,\" says singer and singing coach Helen Astrid. \"It's an incredible endorphin rush. You feel like you've got a spring in your step. You feel like you're being totally true to yourself. It is like making love in a way. You're using your whole body, everything is involved.\"</p> <p>But as well as the sheer pleasure of opening your mouth and belting out a tune, there's also evidence to show that singing can have a tangible impact on your sense of wellbeing in a variety of ways. Professor Graham Welch, chairman of music education and head of the school of arts and humanities at the Institute of Education, University of London, says: \"There is currently a lot of interest in wellbeing and social inclusion and an increasing interest in how music in various forms can support a sense of being part of society and increase your self-esteem. A great deal of research is being done into music and medicine and how music can ameliorate pain.\" </p> <p>Indeed, research published in the Journal of Music Therapy in 2004 suggested that group singing helped people to cope better with chronic pain. </p> <p>Colette Hiller, director of Sing The Nation, is convinced that singing with other people can help individuals connect to each other, and to their environment. \"Think of a football stadium with everyone singing,\" she says. \"There's an excitement, you feel part of it, singing bonds people and always has done. There's a goosebumpy feeling of connection.\" She cites some research in Italy that demonstrated a link between the vigour of local choirs and the level of civic engagement. </p> <p>Nikki Slade, who runs chanting and voice-work classes for everyone from City bankers to addicts at The Priory, believes that the benefits of singing are linked to the primacy and power of the human voice - and our basic instinct to use it. \"People are naturally free and expressive,\" she says, \"but it's something that has been lost on a day-to-day basis.\" </p> <p>You need only watch the evolving behaviour of your friends at a karaoke night - from shy microphone-refuseniks at the start of the night to stage-hogging stars by the end of it - to see that, basically, everybody wants to sing. Though some find it harder than others to take the first steps. Madeleine Lee, a singer/songwriter, singing coach and practitioner of \"holistic song therapy\" (which uses voice work to help individuals confront insecurities and explore their creativity), says she has worked with clients in their 80s, helping them to finally realise a lifelong urge to sing.</p> <p>She says, \"There is no such thing as not being able to sing. It's the most natural thing, but you can be so conscious of it. </p> <p>It's a question of unprogramming all those voices that say, 'You can't do that' and 'You can't sing.'\" </p> <p>One of Lee's clients, Jo Finnigan, agrees that singing happily can have powerful implications for the rest of your life. \"I could already sing,\" she says, \"but Madeleine helped me not try so hard, to be able to sing effortlessly and openly. It felt much more a part of me and that carried into my life. I felt more confident about being myself.\"</p> <p>But it's not only in the realm of holistic medicine and alternative healing that the basic power of singing is acknowledged. </p> <p>\"The point about singing is that it is something we all did when we were born, regardless of colour, creed or anything else,\" says Hancox. \"All the billions of us on the planet sang and for the first nine months of our lives relied on the manipulation of our voice's pitch to meet our basic and fundamental needs.\"</p> <p>Advocates of singing lament its diminishing role in our lives: from the days when we sang round the piano in the pub and to pass the working day, to soothe babies and to mark moments of celebration and sorrow. Singing is sacred and everyday, ritualistic and spontaneous. It makes us better, and makes us feel better. And we should all be doing more of it. </p> <p>\"Even if a person does it only once a month, it makes an extraordinary difference,\" says Hancox. \"It's a staggering thing\".</p>",
  "<p>British racing has rules that prohibit the use of team tactics. After the Ballydoyle pacemaker once again granted his illustrious stablemate safe passage to victory in the rescheduled Juddmonte International last Saturday, it is time they were enforced. This is not, after all, the first time such a blatant breach has unfolded before our eyes.</p> <p>Rule 153 (iv) states that a rider shall not \"make a manoeuvre in a race in the interests of another horse in common ownership or under common control or from the same stable or team, whether or not such a manoeuvre caused interference or caused his horse to fail to achieve its best possible placing\".</p> <p>So why was that rule not applied to the moment when Colm O'Donoghue, the rider on pace-setting Red Rock Canyon, eased away from the rail to leave a Duke Of Marmalade-sized hole up his inside? It was a gap Johnny Murtagh immediately asked that horse to fill, as the shortest route to a fifth consecutive Group One win.</p> <p>O'Donoghue's driving instructor may have watched the race with some satisfaction: it was copybook execution of Mirror, Signal, Manoeuvre. Nearing the half-mile pole, he looked over his left shoulder. Clearly, for his purposes, it was safe to go but, like a careful driver, he also checked over his right once the manoeuvre was complete.</p> <p>Had O'Brien and O'Donoghue been summoned to account by the stewards, they might have argued that Red Rock Canyon peeled off the rail due to hanging under pressure, rather than by the will of his jockey, who was looking around to try to avoid hampering others as his horse weakened.</p> <p>Even though the evidence of video tape appears to undermine such a putative excuse, you are then into the he-said-she-said realms of proving intent in a horse race. This fond notion has fallen on stony ground in many a courtroom now.</p> <p>Yet leaving an inquiry uncalled and allowing the reverberations to echo freely may turn out best - by chance - for the British Horseracing Authority. For Murtagh has since been quoted ascribing clear intent to O'Donoghue's actions. \"I was always going to follow Colm,\" he said. \"I didn't want to start worrying about other horses. I just wanted to worry about myself and Colm and I said to him, 'when you get to the four marker, just ease off and give me the passage through'. It's what Ballydoyle's all about.\"</p> <p>This provides the BHA with an opportunity to advise Team O'Brien that such tactics breach the rules of racing. Given that Saturday's manoeuvre merely ceded an advantage to Duke Of Marmalade, rather than materially improving his finishing position - Phoenix Tower had every chance, once chiselled out of his Ballydoyle coffin - O'Brien can expect a private letter rather than a retrospective inquiry.</p> <p>It is important to separate the heat from light in this issue. Incidents in this year's Irish Derby and Coronation Cup involving Ballydoyle horses do not qualify for the charge. Alessandro Volta could have been any horse veering left in the fever of a finish. Any rider would have sought to capitalise on Getaway's poor positioning on the Epsom camber. Deploying multiple horses in a race does not imply team tactics. Nor does objectively sensible race-riding. </p> <p>The cases of O'Donoghue and that of colleague David McCabe on Honoured Guest in the Queen Anne at Royal Ascot are different, however. Would either - both of whom looked round before any move was made - have forfeited their prime rail position had it been a horse other than, respectively, Duke Of Marmalade and Haradasun behind?</p> <p>The answer is clearly no and the BHA must now belatedly close this chapter, but not before a sheepish confession. Guilty as charged they may be, but you have to admire the scale of operation, depth of preparation and skill of execution that were Ballydoyle team tactics - yet another field in which they are matchless.</p>",
  "<p>The Democratic convention to endorse Barack Obama as the party's first black presidential candidate opened yesterday with a string of speakers, including his wife Michelle, lining up to offer glimpses into his personal life.</p> <p>The aim of the first day was to flesh out his background and to make more human a candidate suffering from accusations from his rival, John McCain, that he is celebrity driven, elitist and out of touch with working-class America.</p> <p>In an interview with CNN ahead of her speech, Michelle Obama said she would present their family as typically American. \"My father was a shift worker, a worker for the city all his life.\" It was not a privileged upbringing: \"No silver spoons, no magic. Just parents who tried their best to leave the next generation just a little bit better off. I think our stories are the quintessential American stories.\"</p> <p>Although Obama has been a regular presence on US screens this year, his life story and politics are still relatively unknown to most Americans. He has failed to connect with white working-class males in key states such as Ohio. A CNN poll yesterday showed him in a dead heat with McCain, at 47% each. Obama had a seven-point lead in last month's CNN poll.</p> <p>The Democratic chairman, Howard Dean, brought his gavel down to mark the start of the four-day convention, one of the most important in the party's history. He told the 4,000 delegates in the hall, and the 15,000 journalists either in the hall or tents nearby, that the convention \"will demonstrate to all Americans why we need Barack Obama and Joe Biden [his vice-presidential running mate] in the White House\".</p> <p>For most of the campaign, Obama has kept his family, other than Michelle, in the background. But his wife, two daughters and other relatives visited the convention centre yesterday morning.</p> <p>Previewing her speech, Obama told supporters on Sunday: \"You'll have a sense of who she is and what our values are and how we're raising our kids. And I think what you'll conclude is: he's sort of like us. He comes from a middle-class background. He went to school on scholarships. He had to pay off student loans. He and his wife had to worry about child care. They had to figure out how to start a college fund for their kids.\"</p> <p>As Michelle Obama gave her first major speech since her husband launched his bid for nomination 20 months ago, the Republican presidential candidate, John McCain told fundraisers in Sacramento, California, that his wife, Cindy, was to visit Georgia to assess the humanitarian situation after the conflict with Russia.</p> <p>McCain's campaign team see foreign affairs as their candidate's strong point and believe he was helped by the conflict. His wife's presence in Georgia will help bring the issue back into the US election campaign.</p>",
  "<p>Power sharing in Northern Ireland was under threat yesterday after warnings from Sinn F\u00e9in that it may pull out of the Stormont government over the failure to devolve policing and justice powers.</p> <p>Unionists warned last night that the republican party's increasingly bellicose tone was destabilising devolved government.</p> <p>Sinn F\u00e9in says it is frustrated over the failure to transfer control of policing and justice from Westminster to the Northern Ireland assembly set out under the St Andrews agreement in 2006.</p> <p>The devolved parliament will reopen after the summer recess early next month and there are growing fears that the bitter exchanges between unionists and Sinn F\u00e9in over the holiday period are precipitating a crisis.</p> <p>The Ulster Unionist leader, Sir Reg Empey, challenged Northern Ireland's deputy first minister, Martin McGuinness, to clarify whether he backed warnings by Sinn F\u00e9in's leader in the Irish parliament that republicans were prepared to pull out of the power sharing executive.</p> <p>The leader, Caoimhgh\u00edn \u00d3 Caol\u00e1in, said his party's patience should not be tested. \"If we are forced to conclude that change will not be forthcoming from the executive then we will have no option but to pull out our ministers and seek to put pressure where responsibility ultimately lies, which is the British government in London,\" he told a gathering of republicans at the weekend.</p> <p>Responding to the threat, Empey said: \"If Martin McGuinness does not distance himself from this statement then a full-blown crisis is facing the executive next month.\" </p> <p>Jeffrey Donaldson, a junior minister in the largest unionist party, the DUP, said the threats to pull out were neither constructive nor helpful. \"Such language, as has been used by this Sinn F\u00e9in representative, begins to cast significant doubt on Sinn F\u00e9in's commitment to making progress in Stormont,\" the Lagan Valley MP said.</p> <p>The creation of ministries in charge of policing and judicial matters was scheduled to be completed by last May.</p> <p>However, the DUP is nervous that devolving these powers means they could end up in the hands of a Sinn F\u00e9in minister, possibly even a former IRA member, which could rebound electorally on the party. The DUP faces a critical battle at the European elections next June to wrest a seat back from former party member and now head of the hard-line Traditional Unionist Voice, Jim Allister.</p>",

For in a creative profession where a million trailer-makers have fought long and hard for the idea that a picture tells a thousand words, these brave mavericks are fighting for their right to use a thousand words instead. Or as close to it as they can fit into two and a half minutes, anyway. But what were those words? And how did they actually illuminate what people might expect from the film? Let's have a look.</p> <p><strong>SHE WELCOMED HIM INTO HER HOME</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336944019\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/08/25/bridhead9220.jpg\" alt=\"Brideshead Revisited\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>It says. Which refers, it appears, to Emma Thompson, since she's the only lady we've seen this far, and also because when we did see her, she said 'Welcome to my home\" or something like. So just in case we couldn't trust that moving image and the words coming out of Emma Thompson's mouth, it's been written on screen as well, which is terribly helpful.</p> <p><strong>INTO A WORLD OF PRIVILEGE </strong></p> <p>It says, after a montage of horse-riding, grand houses and the like, which might - without having to be pointed out in words - have suggested wealth (and quite possibly privilege) in the mind of any canny cinema-goer. Or, in fact, anyone.</p> <p><strong>INTO A LIFE HE NEVER IMAGINED</strong></p> <p>Crikey, get on with it.</p> <p><strong>BASED ON THE ACCLAIMED NOVEL... </strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336944020\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/08/25/bridgesad7220.jpg\" alt=\"Brideshead Revisited\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Really? How loosely, exactly? There would appear to be a lot more suggestion of dark dirty dealings, possible incestuous rompings and possible criminal undertones than I remember. And seems to suggest an awful lot more of the matriarchal figure than comes to mind when I think of the 1981 ITV version, but I could be completely wrong. Usually am. Besides, Emma Thompson is the most famous, and it's always good to show the most famous person a lot in your trailer isn't it.</p> <p>Of course, it could mean \"based on\" in a much more literal and prosaic way, in the sense of \"it's got lots of words in it\". Much like the book. And we're demonstrating that via the sheer number of words offered to you our humble viewer in the trailer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336944021\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/08/25/brideshd8220.jpg\" alt=\"Brideshead Revisited\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>\"How did you enjoy Brideshead?\" asks Michael Gambon, seated between an attractive young man and an attractive young woman. \"What a lot of temptations,\" purrs Gambon, with a deliciously dirty edge to his voice, running his sweaty hands over the arms and legs of the brother/sister pair flanking him. </p> <p><strong>ONE MAN'S DESIRE</strong></p> <p>And with that, the music shifts from an inoffensive pastoral to a hard-guitared rock number, bringing to mind a much more risky, edgy, sexy revisitation of Brideshead than the polite period drama we might have been expecting. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336944022\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/08/25/brideshead4220.jpg\" alt=\"Brideshead Revisited\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>So if we were coming to this trailer without knowing anything about the book or series, we would presume that the main guy, let's call him Charles Ryder (because that is his name) had been having a relationship with the young man who took him home to a big castle where he was seduced by the young man's mother, his sister, and then ended up in some kind of compromising situation with all of them at once AND some kind of dirty uncle. Classic literature like you only dreamed of in dull secondary school English classes.</p> <p><strong>ONE MAN'S AMBITION</strong></p> <p>It carries on. </p> <p><strong>ONE MAN'S PASSION</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336944023\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/08/25/bridhedad10220.jpg\" alt=\"Brideshead Revisited\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Quite a lot of people's passion, truth be told. Passion all over the place. Passion spurting out of their ears. If there's one thing the privileged people of Brideshead are not short of, according to this trailer, it's passion. Oh, and horses.</p> <p><strong>ONE WOMAN'S CONTROL</strong></p> <p>Back to Emma Thomson again, looking stern in a grey wig. </p> <p><strong>ONE WOMAN'S DECISION</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336944024\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/08/25/brideshead2220.jpg\" alt=\"Brideshead Revisited\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Not Emma Thompson's decision, though, it seems. The sister, Julia, is seen having to make a decision. So that should probably more accurately be \"ANOTHER WOMAN'S DECISION\", though I hesitate to point it out because I'm just not sure that encouraging them to expand upon their on-screen trailer exposition is a very good idea. </p> <p>I mean, clearly they'd love to if they could. As each capitalised teaser follows hard on the heels of the last, you wonder what <em>didn't</em> make it to the trailers final cut if this much did. \"ONE MAN AND HIS JOURNEY INTO A DIFFERENT WORLD\" it might have said, if only their wishes had been granted and they'd been given the opportunity just to push a little more information in. \"A WORLD LIKE HIS OWN WORLD BUT DIFFERENT\", they could have said, explaining what was going on on screen. \"IN WHICH HE GETS TO HAVE SEX WITH LADIES\" perhaps. \"UNLIKE AT HOME WHERE HE WOULDN'T GET TO DO THAT SO MUCH\" Because you want to make sure people know how different that is. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336944025\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/08/25/brideshead220.jpg\" alt=\"Brideshead Revisited\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>\"BUT WHERE SOMETIMES HE MIGHT GO TO THE SHOPS\" I imagine them toying with, in order to round out the character that tiny bit more. \"OR TO SEE HIS NANA\" they could have continued, humanising him in the eyes of their target market. \"EXCEPT ON THURSDAYS WHEN SHE GOES DOWN THE BINGO\". Because according to this trailer director, there is NO SUCH THING as putting too many words on screen in capitals.</p> <p><strong>ONE WOMAN'S POWER</strong></p> <p>Another! Brilliant. It is unsure which woman is being referred to here (though Charles' nana is always a possibility) but there is a woman here, so it might be her: </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336944026\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Film/Pix/pictures/2008/08/25/bridhead11220.jpg\" alt=\"Brideshead Revisited\" width=\"220\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>\"Tell me, what does Charles Ryder <em>really</em> want?\" a woman we've never seen before says to Charles Ryder. I don't know, but if I was him, I'd probably want people to stop referring to me in third person. It's really annoying. </p> <p><strong>BRIDESHEAD REVISITED</strong></p> <p>It says, finally, as the pumping music builds to a heart-racing crescendo and we become convinced that this must the most exciting film to be made about ambiguous sexuality and dangerous liasons since The Talented Mr Ripley. Or Dangerous Liasons, now we come to think of it. And with that, it must surely have come to an end.</p> <p><strong>COMING SOON</strong></p> <p>It says.

  "<p>Capturing Film History in the Making recently transferred from London's Getty Images Gallery to the exhibition space of the Walter Reade cinema at New York's Lincoln Center \u2013 apt enough for a show that celebrates transatlantic collaboration. A collection of photographs taken at Pinewood, Shepperton and Teddington, mostly in the 40s, 50s and 60s, it's a rum and variable grouping of the glamorous, the ordinary and the absurd \u2013 and occasionally all three at once, as in one amusing shot from the set of Cleopatra. </p> <p>Joseph Mankiewicz looks through his viewfinder at Richard Burton, whose ornate breastplate is somewhat undercut by the civilian trousers and shoes he wears underneath it, and the fag dangling from his lips. Elizabeth Taylor, meanwhile, sits next to him in fishnets and a white fur hat, apparently swilling wine and having a gay old time. None of the footage shot at Pinewood made it into the final cut of the movie.</p> <p>There's always something pleasing about the sight of stars mucking about in costume \u2013 it confirms the notion that movie-making is essentially a lark, however much detailed information we might have about to the contrary \u2013 and there are several other such shots here. There's Margaret Rutherford chucking young Norman Wisdom on the chin (on the set of his 1954 breakthrough, Trouble in Store); there's Brando, hovering attentively over Lollobrigida lolling on a reclining armchair off-set on A Countess from Hong Kong. </p> <p>There's also the opposite effect, in which fantasyland is made to look boring, even laborious. Look at Kubrick, sat in General Buck Turgidson's quarters while shooting Dr Strangelove: George C. Scott is on his left, in boxer shorts and an open Hawaiian shirt, Tracy Reed on his right, in her underwear, either putting a gown on or taking it off. A killer tableau \u2013 yet the maestro couldn't look more bored if he tried. Nor does Alec Guinness look at his most content rehearsing a mamba for Captain's Paradise; while a shot from the set of The Road to Hong Kong \u2013 the last of Bing Crosby and Bob Hope's Road movies, also featuring Peter Sellers \u2013 sees three of the screen's consummate entertainers each gazing blankly in a different direction.</p> <p>There are also reminders of once-prevalent practices that have fallen from favour. With the occasional notable exception \u2013 Nicole Kidman, step forward \u2013 the false nose is rarely deployed by major stars these days. Here, however, we find no fewer than three case studies in proboscis enhancement. Orson Welles is seen in the studio caf\u00e9 during the shooting of the forgettable whodunit Trent's Last Case, perhaps considering how to negotiate his cup of coffee without threatening the integrity of the latex. (Sadly, there are no images here from the Shepperton set of The Third Man, one of the few movies in which Welles appeared without a false nose.) </p> <p>Elsewhere, Laurence Olivier is seen being made up as beaky Richard III, arrestingly arranged against a black background. But most striking of all is Alec Guinness, similarly composed against black, David Lean crouching at his feet as the finishing touches are applied to the outrageous hook nose he wore as Fagin. Leaping out from the dark as if shot in 3D, it's a reminder of why the characterisation becomes harder to defend with each passing year.</p> <p>There are fewer than a handful of colour shots in the whole show. The Red Shoes's Moira Shearer poses with half-tied slipper for a print of weirdly saturated red and turquoise, while Sellers vamps for a photographer in half a Clouseau outfit, his hat, moustache and trenchcoat incongruously matched with jeans and sneakers. Perhaps the weirdest image in the show, and also by far the most recent, shows Keira Knightley in front of a blue screen, her skin bleached and hair wild \u2013 because, you realise after a moment, she's floating in a tank. The scuba diver perched beyond her chartreuse-clad shoulder in a vivid lemon-yellow-rimmed mask completes the look. What strange larks.</p>",
  "<p>Groups of protesters converging on the Democratic convention were aiming to turn up the volume today after a low-key start to their disruption of Barack Obama's presidential coronation.</p> <p>Organisers had predicted upwards of 25,000 protesters this week, but their first few events drew only about 1,000.</p> <p>At today's march, demonstrators used their megaphone as much to defend their sparse numbers as to criticise the Democrats.</p> <p>After citing media reports of low turnout, one activist leader cried: \"Well, no shit! They built protest cages with barbed wire! No kidding, so people were afraid to come out!\"</p> <p>When morning broke on the \"freedom cage\", as the fenced-in protest zone built by Democrats has been called, police outnumbered dissenters.</p> <p>\"We're here to tell people, don't put all your hopes in Obama,\" said Adam Jung, 28, an organiser with the Tent State university protest group, as he rolled up his sleeping bag.</p> <p>\"He's not an anti-war candidate,\" Jung added. \"He's billing himself as that. It's not true.\"</p> <p>But David Svabick, 55, one of Jung's neighbours in the protest pen, was a less committed critic of the Democratic nominee. Obama is \"not why I'm here\", he said. \"There's one [candidate] about change, and the other one's not.\"</p> <p>Indeed, the tense pre-convention battles between protest organisers and police appeared to be cooling as separate bands of protesters made for manageable crowds around the city.</p> <p>Despite a law enforcement force 5,000 strong at the ready, Denver officials have reported only five arrests so far. Many activists were more wary of police wielding digital cameras than those wielding guns.</p> <p>\"I don't like corporate control and fascism, and the thought of my face being recognised in a situation like this,\" a 20-year-old marcher with his face swathed in a bandanna said. He would only use the name Aurora. \"Maybe I'm just paranoid.\"</p> <p>At the city courthouse a group called Recreate 68, which aims to recapture the spirit of the violent protests at the 1968 Democratic convention, gathered.</p> <p>They were joined by some anarchists, some Ralph Nader backers, some immigrant-rights activists, and some protesters looking only to keep Obama on the liberal path. </p> <p>The conflicting messages created a cacophonous effect, but Eric Verlo, 47, saw unity in the chaos.</p> <p>\"The common message people have is that parties aren't responsive to us,\" said Verlo, who travelled to Denver to vent his frustration with what he called Obama's abandonment of progressive ideas.</p> <p>The protest zone \"is where you bring all those messages and say, 'we're not being represented'\", he added.</p> <p>Asked about the \"freedom cage\", a city police spokeswoman diplomatically replied that \"we're not really referring to it as that\". Officials prefer to call it \"a public viewing area of 50,000 square feet within eight feet of the delegates\", the stated rationale for its creation.</p> <p><strong>A sampling of things seen and heard at the Denver protests:</strong></p> <p>\"Lord Obama's Concept of America the Beautiful\" \u2013 the painted inscription, above a large photo of a dead infant, on an anti-abortion truck travelling the streets</p> <p>\"How the hell can they say we're illegal? This is occupied Mexican land. What goes around comes around, and this is what the US is faced with: this great fear of Mexicans repopulating the seven states they took from us.\" \u2013 Ricardo Romero, immigrants-rights activist and national coordinator of the Mexican Liberation Organisation</p> <p>\"Everybody get naked! Starting with you!\" \u2013 a shirtless protester, directed at a nearby woman</p> <p>\"Hippies\u2026\" \u2013 the response of an anarchist who overheard the above</p> <p>\"There is no saviour coming in Barack Obama and the Democratic party! They are complicit in the torture state!\" - a protest leader at today's courthouse march.</p> <p>\"AT&amp;T is a sponsor of Obama and his cronies [at the convention], and AT&amp;T is spying on us.\" \u2013 a dissenter named Maria, referring to the Bush White House surveillance programme instituted after the 9/11 attacks</p> <p>\"We support people expressing their First Amendment rights. We just want people to do it in a way that doesn't impede the rights of others.\" \u2013 Denver police spokesman Sonny Jackson</p>",
  "<p>\u2022 As the Democratic convention got under way, at least three tornadoes touched down in or near Denver, accompanied by thunder and spectacular lightning \u2014 proof, surely, that God hates liberals, although maybe he was simply expressing aesthetic objections to some of the extraordinarily tacky Obama merchandise for sale on every street corner. A tiny number of John McCain-branded goods were also available, in the interests of balance. At its main stage in downtown Denver, the news network MSNBC was distributing the most ill-conceived merchandise of the convention so far: nonpartisan t-shirts featuring both Obama and McCain. </p> <p>\u2022 All eyes will be on Obama's running-mate Joe Biden when he addresses the convention Wednesday night. Or at least they will for the first hour or three: the Delaware senator has a famous tendency to ramble. The Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen once gently criticised this loquaciousness in a column, prompting a phone message from Biden, who thanked him for making the point, which he acknowledged was a fair one, although then again, he said, he did have his reasons for speaking at such length, but yes, it was probably a legitimate criticism, and that \u2014 at which point Cohen's answering machine cut him off.</p> <p>\u2022 A big truck is making its way through the streets of Denver, all day, every day, urging people to \"Vote Libertarian!\". They won't, of course: almost everyone here's a Democrat, implacably opposed to the Libertarian argument that pretty much all taxation is supremely evil unless, possibly, it's being used to fund a strong military. Under a zero-taxation libertarian administration, of course, there'd presumably be no streets for such a truck to drive down. But we can cross that bridge when we come to it. Which we won't, owing to the lack of streets.</p> <p>\u2022 Tonight at the convention will be all about Barack Obama's family \u2014 his wife, his half-sister and his brother-in-law were all scheduled to appear \u2014 but someone was missing: George Hussein Onyango Obama, one of his half-brothers, who lives in Kenya. Republicans in Texas released an ad today that railed against the nominee for allowing his relative to live in squalor: \"If Barack cares so much about your family,\" it asks, \"why doesn't he take care of his family first?\" Awkwardly, though, George Obama isn't staying on message. \"Here [in Kenya],\" he told a reporter recently, \"I am surrounded by friends and family and feel safe and secure.\"<br></p>",
  "<p>When President George Bush and Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki signed a <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2007/11/20071126-11.html\">declaration of principles</a> for a long-term relationship between the US and Iraq in late November 2007, the US envisioned that the agreement would enable it to establish an extensive strategic relationship with an Iraq grateful for the blood and treasure the US spilled in liberating and stabilising that country.</p> <p>The Bush administration believed that this kind of relationship would make a free, democratic, pluralistic, federal and unified Iraq a strong and dependable ally in the American global war on terror. Furthermore, it would ensure that our Iraqi allies would allow the US to maintain a permanent military presence in their country, provide the bases and freedom of action for these combat forces to project American military power throughout the greater Middle East, and serve as a bulwark against Iranian expansion.</p> <p>In other words, the US would be able to project power regionally, as do US forces in Germany, Japan and South Korea. The administration believed that achieving anything less would be an admission of defeat and would empower our enemies in the war on terror.</p> <p>The Bush administration was so confident about achieving these results quickly that it agreed not to ask that the UN mandate be extended past December 31 of this year and stated that the negotiations would be wrapped up on July 31. Moreover, the president and his supporters said that, of course, if the Iraqis wanted us to leave, we would, while simultaneously branding those who wanted to set a timetable for withdrawal as defeatists who would undermine the gains made by the surge. </p> <p>However, on Friday, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/22/world/middleeast/22baghdad.html?scp=1&amp;sq=\" draft\" accord said to set goals for iraq pullout&amp;st=\"cse&quot;\">US and Iraqi negotiators completed a draft accord</a> that demands that the US remove its combat troops from Iraqi cities by June 2009 and from the rest of the country by December 31, 2011. While American officials argue that these timetables for withdrawing American combat forces depend on conditions on the ground, this decision will not be made by the US alone, but in concert with the Iraqis, who do not see it as conditional. While speaking with tribal leaders today, <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/meast/08/25/iraq.main/\">Maliki said that the US and Iraq have reached an agreement</a> on a final date for withdrawal.</p> <p>Moreover, the draft accord could be rejected by the Presidential Council (which consists of the prime minister, the president, two vice-presidents and the head of the Kurdish regional government), senior Iraqi security officials and the Iraqi parliament. Since most of these officials, including Maliki, and the Iraqi people wanted all American troops out by the end of 2010, it is not a foregone conclusion that all of these groups will accept the 2011 deadline. </p> <p>How did the Bush administration so misjudge the situation? Why did it agree to a timetable for withdrawal after disparaging those who took such a position as defeatists? Some would argue that the security situation has improved so dramatically in the past 18 months that a timetable has become more realistic. But on the same day that the details of the pact were revealed, General David Petraeus, the commander of US forces in Iraq, said the gains are not durable and that the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/21/world/middleeast/21general.html?scp=1&amp;sq=\" exiting\" iraq, petraeus says gains are fragile&amp;st=\"cse&quot;\">US role is not anywhere near finished</a>. And, President Bush has said repeatedly that when it comes to withdrawing US troops, he will be guided by the US commanders on the ground in Iraq.</p> <p>The reason that the Iraqis want a timetable is that there is a <a href=\"http://www.philly.com/inquirer/opinion/20080817_Iraqis_must_control_their_own_security.html\">broad Iraqi political consensus</a> in favour of a US commitment to withdraw its forces from the country, and, while there does not yet exist a consensus among Iraqis as to what the new Iraq will be, a broad consensus does exist that no genuine, sustainable Iraqi unity can develop while the government continues to be underwritten by a large foreign military presence. </p> <p>It is important to remember that Maliki opposed the surge of US troops and the US agreement to train and pay the Sunni insurgents, which became known as the Anbar Awakening. In late 2006, as President Bush was deciding on the next steps in Iraq, Maliki urged him to redeploy American forces to the outskirts of Baghdad and allow Iraqi forces to take control of Baghdad. And he has not only refused to incorporate more than a token number of these 100,000 Sunni insurgents, now known as the Sons of Iraq, into the Iraqi Security Forces, but he is also <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/22/world/middleeast/22sunni.html?scp=1&amp;sq=\" iraq\" takes aim at us-tied sunni group's leaders&amp;st=\"cse&quot;\">already arresting</a> hundreds of the members of the Awakening movement. </p> <p>In dealing with Iraq, the Bush administration has consistently demonstrated that it has little understanding of Iraqi history and culture. Just as the Iraqis would not greet any foreign armies as liberators, they are not going to accept a permanent military presence on their soil. These negotiations show that the Iraqis want to take control of their own destiny. We should let them do so. It offers them and us the best, if not the only, chance of gaining something positive from the mess we created.</p>",
  "<p>The four-day Democratic convention to endorse Barack Obama as the party's first black presidential candidate was scheduled to kick off in Denver today with a speech by Michelle Obama tackling claims that he is elitist and un-American.</p> <p>In her first major speech since her husband's campaign for the White House began 20 months ago, she was due to try to show the human face of a candidate that his rival, John McCain, portrays as celebrity-driven and out-of-touch with working-class America.</p> <p>In an interview with CNN ahead of her speech she said she would present their family as typically American. \"My father was a shift worker, a worker for the city all his life.\" It was not a privileged upbringing: \"No silver spoons, no magic. Just parents who tried their best to leave the next generation just a little bit better off.\"</p> <p>\"I think our stories are the quintessential American stories.\"</p> <p>Her speech was part of a three-pronged approach by her husband's campaign team for the convention: flesh out his personality, elaborate on his policies and present the Democratic party as united.</p> <p>Although Obama has been a regular presence on US screens all this year, his life-story and politics are still relatively unknown to most Americans. </p> <p>He has failed to connect with white working-class males in key states such as Ohio, partly on race grounds but also because he is viewed as a dilettante.</p> <p>After two White House election defeats at the hands of Republicans, there is nervousness among Democrats in Denver about whether Obama can overcome the negatives stacked against him. </p> <p>That concern was not helped today by a CNN poll showing him in a dead heat with McCain, at 47% for each. Obama had held a seven-point lead in last month's CNN poll.</p> <p>For most of the campaign, Obama has kept his family, other than Michelle, in the background. But his wife, two daughters and other relatives visited the convention centre this morning to provide an early photo-opportunity and to scout out the hall ahead of her speech.</p> <p>In an interview with the Denver Post published today, she said she would use her speech to share stories about \"the values that drive him, experiences that shaped him, and why I believe he will be an extraordinary president. I'll also share stories about my life and my background with the country.\"</p> <p>Previewing his wife's speech, Obama told supporters yesterday, at the end of a day campaigning in Wisconsin: \"You'll have a sense of who she is and what our values are and how we're raising our kids. And I think what you'll conclude is: He's sort of like us. He comes from a middle-class background. He went to school on scholarships. He had to pay off student loans. He and his wife had to worry about child care. They had to figure out how to start a college fund for their kids.\"</p>",
  "<p>Liberal icon Senator Ted Kennedy will make an appearance at the Democratic convention in Denver tonight, rallying the party faithful behind Barack Obama and, if he feels up to it, addressing the gathering.</p> <p>The venerated Massachusetts Democrat, who is suffering from brain cancer, will be feted with a video tribute, and his niece Caroline Kennedy will make a speech praising him.</p> <p>Kennedy, who was afflicted with brain cancer this spring, travelled to Denver yesterday and got a check-up at a local hospital, and Democratic party activists had hoped he would be well enough lift spirits by showing his face in the convention hall or attending some of the festivities surrounding the meeting.</p> <p>Rumours of a possible appearance swirled yesterday and earlier today, and the Associated Press, citing a senior Democratic official, reported this afternoon that Kennedy will watch the tribute video and may address the convention if he feels well enough.</p> <p>\"He's truly humbled by the outpouring of support and wouldn't miss it for anything in the world,\" said Stephanie Cutter, a Kennedy spokeswoman.</p> <p>Kennedy's immune system has been weakened by the course of chemotherapy, and his doctors fear an appearance at the packed convention could endanger his health. But he has prepared a speech and badly wants to deliver it, the Boston Globe reported.</p> <p>Kennedy is wildly popular among Democrats, who admire him for his championing of liberal causes including expanded healthcare. </p> <p>Kennedy also symbolises a bygone era of Democratic dominance in Washington.</p> <p>Democratic leaders hope that a focus on Kennedy will unite a party that has lately been riven with renewed tension among supporters of Hillary Clinton, whom nominee Barack Obama beat after a bitter, 16-month long primary fight.</p> <p>The eight-minute celebratory video, to be shown tonight, was produced by documentary filmmakers Ken Burns and Mark Herzog, and features the senator and his wife Victoria, and interviews with prominent Democrats and others. </p> <p>Caroline Kennedy, who endorsed Obama in January, will speak at the podium about the senator's career and his \"future plans in the United States Senate\", the Democratic party said in a news release.</p> <p>The Massachusetts senator is a scion of the legendary American political family that saw two promising young Democratic politicians assassinated in the 1960s. He is the second most senior member of the Senate and among the most influential backers of Obama during the long primary campaign.</p> <p>Kennedy's brother John was elected president in 1960 and killed in November 1963 as he kicked off his re-election bid. Another brother Bobby, a US senator from New York and attorney general under John Kennedy, was killed in Los Angeles during his 1968 campaign for president.</p> <p>Kennedy was elected to the US senate in 1962, taking over John's seat. He sought to carry the family baton to the White House in 1980, but his challenge to incumbent Democratic president Jimmy Carter failed.</p> <p>In January, Kennedy shook up the Democratic primary race by endorsing Obama, snubbing Clinton. He said Obama would be \"a president who refuses to be trapped in the patterns of the past,\" and said the Illinois senator \"sees the world clearly without being cynical\".</p> <p>The nod was one of the most prized endorsements of the campaign, and leant establishment backing to Obama, a relative newcomer to Washington. </p> <p>The senator suffered a seizure in May and was soon thereafter diagnosed with a malignant brain tumour. Politicians of all stripes were saddened by the news. </p> <p>Early on in his treatment he was photographed with his family and appeared in good spirits, although lately he has receded from the public eye, prompting concerns about his health.</p>",
  "<p>Gordon Smith, the chief executive of the Scottish FA, has stressed he would welcome video assistance for the country's beleaguered referees but believes the prospect of that becoming reality is extremely remote.</p> <p>The controversial decision to disallow what would have been a winning goal for Rangers at Aberdeen on Saturday has heightened already severe scrutiny of Scottish Premier League officials. A short time later, Celtic's Stephen McManus clearly used his arm to open the scoring against Falkirk. The Parkhead club had been involved in much-debated penalty incidents during their previous two matches.</p> <p>Smith has sympathy for the men in black, although he has been rebuffed in his plans to implement technology into the Scottish game. \"Fifa have said 'no way',\" the chief executive explained. \"They claim that it demeans the referee and it would take the human element out of the game. I have been to Fifa meetings and listened to the arguments - personally, I believe we should bring technology on board and use it. </p> <p>\"When I put it to Fifa, I was almost put down. They said that this is football, it wouldn't work. I'm of a different opinion, I think it would work and take a lot of pressure off referees.\"</p> <p>Last week Donald McVicar, Scotland's referees chief, sent a memo warning officials to improve performances. Against that backdrop Dougie McDonald was yesterday handed the onerous task of taking charge of Sunday's first Old Firm match of the season. </p> <p>Kenny Clark, who retired as a Grade One referee at the end of the last campaign, has claimed McVicar's actions \"put a gun\" to the heads of his former colleagues. \"You could have a policy like tennis, where managers are allowed two challenges per game to the video referee,\" added Smith. \"If [the Rangers manager] Walter Smith had that option in Aberdeen, it would have solved Saturday's dilemma. But, to be honest, it is not going to happen during my time in football.\"</p>",
  "<p>In the second of 1988's presidential debates, Democratic candidate <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2000/debates/history.story/1988.html\">Michael Dukakis was asked the following question</a>: \"Governor, if Kitty Dukakis [his wife] were raped and murdered, would you favour an irrevocable death penalty for the killer?\" </p> <p>Dukakis <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF9gSyku-fc\">replied</a>: \"No, I don't, and I think you know that I've opposed the death penalty during all of my life.\" He went on to discuss the decline in murder statistics in his home state. His answer was coolly delivered, well argued and coherent. It was also disastrous. Dukakis's poll ratings dropped several points the day after, and his answer to that question was blamed by many, including the candidate himself, for his subsequent defeat.</p> <p>It's no mean feat to make George Bush Sr seem emotionally empathetic, but that's what Dukakis did that night, if only by contrast. Instead of betraying any hint of the anger such a scenario might be expected to evoke, Dukakis gave an entirely rational answer. In doing so he came across as a bloodless bureaucrat, a robo-politician with no heart and soul. <em>The guy's asked about what he'd do if his wife is raped and murdered and he barely blinks?</em></p> <p>That moment remains a powerful reminder of the role of anger, and overt emotion generally, in presidential elections. It came to mind last week after the performances of Barack Obama and John McCain at the <a href=\"http://voices.washingtonpost.com/thefix/2008/08/saddleback_forum_first_thought.html?hpid=topnews\">Saddleback forum</a>. Of the two, McCain was the more emotionally expressive. He seemed filled with regret as he mentioned the failure of his first marriage, teary when he talked about his time as a captive in Vietnam and fired up with outrage at Russia's treatment of Georgia. Obama's replies, by contrast, were thoughtful, nuanced and impeccably even-toned throughout. McCain was <a href=\"http://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/p-j-gladnick/2008/08/17/leftwing-blogosphere-disappointed-obama-saddleback-forum-performance\">judged by most</a> to be <a href=\"http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MTBjN2RkY2Y3ODZhYmRmYTZjYTI1NTQ4ZGNkM2Y2YmU=\">the night's winner</a>.</p> <p>Democrats are praying that this week's convention is the moment when Americans get to know Obama. But some worry the man often referred to as <a href=\"http://blogs.reuters.com/trail08/2008/03/12/could-no-drama-obama-lead-in-a-crisis/\">\"No Drama Obama\"</a> may be too cool for his own good. Obama's <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/02/AR2008080201687.html?hpid=topnews\">ever-present composure</a> is one of his strengths. It conveys good judgement and grace under pressure. It's also part of the reason that, as an African-American, he's got this far at all. The stereotype of the angry black man berating the white population for its sins is partly why black politicians have found it hard to reach beyond their own racial constituencies. Obama's restraint takes the heat out of racial politics.</p> <p>But it's also a vulnerability. After all, America is in a pretty foul mood itself. Four-fifths of Americans believe their country is headed in the wrong direction. Gas prices are up, and so are foreclosures. People are working harder than ever and have less to spend. Washington is awash with money and broken promises. Voters aren't surveying this mess and raising a quizzical eyebrow. They're thumping the table and demanding change. They want their candidates to feel that anger too.</p> <p>McCain's famously quick temper is often discussed as a liability. If it gets out of control, it might well be. But his high emotional temperature is an advantage in this race if it manifests itself in the right way. He knows this. During the primaries he ran an ad that made a virtue of his reputation for getting mad, declaring that he would use his anger to bring change to Washington.</p> <p>Now, Obama is no Dukakis. He makes speeches that move the spirit as well as stimulate the mind. He's at ease discussing his personal life, his marriage and his kids. But if he's going to persuade the voters he's the man they're looking for this year, he's going to have to step up his emotional intensity. People are willing to believe he understands the nation's problems at an intellectual level. Now they want to know he <em>gets it</em>. Joe Biden is great at conveying empathy, and while Obama won't and shouldn't try to emulate Biden's heart-on-sleeve style, he'll surely be looking for opportunities this week and during the rest of the campaign to show flashes of anger, glimpses of raw emotion.</p> <p>Some will see this as dumbing down. Democrats have traditionally disdained emotionalism in politics, believing it to be a crude weapon used by their opponents to vulgarise reasonable debate. Even as they recognised his genius for communication, many held their nose at Bill Clinton's public displays of empathy. </p> <p>But it's not unreasonable of the public to demand emotion from their politicians. We want our politicians to hear us, and being emotionally empathetic is just another way of signalling that you're a good listener. Look back at that Dukakis answer. He didn't just refuse to engage with the emotional content of that question. He answered a different question altogether.</p> <p>Much of the latest neurological and psychological research tells us that emotion is at the core of our decision-making processes, even when we think we're being rational. So it makes sense to trust politicians who seem emotionally literate. After all, how are you going to negotiate with world leaders, or understand how people choose health insurance, unless you have good instincts for the role of emotion in human behaviour?</p> <p>Politicians need to demonstrate they're one of us. And that means getting angry once in a while.</p>",
  "<p>Remember the <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26104003/\">American who was murdered in Beijing</a> on the eve of the Olympic games, the father-in-law of the US men's volleyball coach? I ask because the senselessness of his death was successfully papered over by the spectacular splendour of the opening ceremonies and the otherworldly performance of Michael Phelps, who won his first gold medal mere hours after the murder. The Chinese organisers, the International Olympic Committee and NBC were fortunate that swimming took place that first week, and that <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/08/17/sports/OLY-TV-NBCs-Olympics.php\">NBC managed to convince everyone to have Phelps swim in the morning</a>, Beijing time, so his heroics could be seen in prime time back home. The nightly drama was compelling, especially when Phelps finished the drill, as we say on the gridiron.</p> <p>It seemed like good news trumping bad would be the paradigm for these games, which featured exceptional TV ratings and plenty of buzz. But after two weeks of unending praise for the Beijing games, a few <a href=\"http://www.torontosun.com/Sports/Beijing2008/2008/08/25/6562291-sun.html\">sour notes began to poke through</a> the rainbow in the last few days. Controversy continued over <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/22/sports/olympics/22age.html?em\">the age of female gymnasts</a> from the host country, although anyone with eyes could see they were mostly pre-pubescent. The opening ceremonies turned out to have been not everything they seemed to be. Several media titans <a href=\"http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1144279/index.htm\">took note</a> of the fact that these were the <a href=\"http://sports.espn.go.com/espnmag/story?id=3542649\">Potemkin games</a>, with a pretty facade but virtually no movement on human rights, press and protest freedoms and Chinese foreign policy in places like Sudan, despite assurances to the contrary. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/video/2008/aug/14/ioc.alex.thomson.olympics\">This exchange</a> sums up the frustration in the media about the phoney promises.</p> <p>I wouldn't be surprised if the coming days and weeks see something of a backlash against the games. Partially, that's inevitable \u2013 anything that sees as much praise and hype as the Olympics did that first week is due for a correction. Partially, it will come as the celebration wears off and the disappointments get more attention (USA Track and Field first and foremost, but the boxing team also deserves an autopsy). Fortunately, at least for the US, the basketball team, the so-called \"Redeem Team\", held off a determined challenge from Spain and captured the gold for the first time in eight years. Had they blown it, no amount of good feeling from Phelps and the beach volleyball players would have been enough to assuage the recriminations.</p> <p>But mainly, the backlash will be because of China \u2013 or, more accurately, the Middle Kingdom's place in the world vis-\u00e0-vis the US. The dominant emotion behind criticism is usually fear, and that will be the case here. We all have heard about China's rumbling toward world dominion, while the US readies for a long, if not necessarily steep, fall. Whether that happens or not, the next few years and beyond seem primed for Sino-American rivalry, and because of that, there will be those who will be eager to tear down the games as an accomplishment.</p> <p>NBC, for its part, seemed to sense this coming. During its Sunday afternoon coverage, host Jim Lampley took time to note that while there were some issues, no one can doubt the greatness of the games and the host country that staged them. Who cares about human rights, not to mention the rest of this vast country outside Beijing and the Great Wall, which was hardly shown, when there were so many world records?</p> <p>The problem is, you can't use the Olympics as a springboard (three-metre or otherwise) for world-power status, yet expect to have the games treated as merely games. The sports on display will be forgotten, probably as soon as football starts stateside (and with the Premiership underway, the other footy has already removed the Olympics from the frontal lobes in many other places). Not so with China's actions, both foreign and domestic. Because of that, expect the 2008 summer games to have a hangover once the celebratory champagne buzz wears off. Just as the US volleyball coach will have to deal with the reality of his loss, <a href=\"http://www.nbcolympics.com/volleyball/news/newsid=253178.html\">despite the gold medal</a> around his neck.</p>",

However, for a time I dabbled with a bizarre offshoot, 3 Nc3, sometimes named after the 19th-century Irish-American player James Mason (though he seems to have played it just once and lost), sometimes after Paul Keres (though he was once checkmated with it in just 12 moves).</p> <p>3... Qh4+ is obvious and good. White is forced to play 4 Ke2, blocking his king's bishop, and, crucially, losing the right to castle. However, there's method in this madness. White will gain time against the queen on the next turn by playing Nf3, and can build a strong centre with d4. To refute White's idea Black must play with energy and some accuracy. The outrageousness of this gambit appealed to the King family, but I ditched it when my opponents got too strong. My brother, nowadays an occasional but enthusiastic online player, has continued playing the opening, apparently with some success. His opponents often cop out of the queen check and play 3... g5, appropriate with a knight on f3, but here disastrous. 4 h4! breaks up the kingside pawns and leaves White, after moves such as d4, Bxf4 and Bc4, with a beautiful attacking position. It's a classic case of how an unusual opening can throw stereotyped players.</p> <p>In serious competition, the gambit has always had mixed results - to put it kindly - but as a surprise weapon it has claimed some scalps. The player of the black pieces in this encounter is International Master strength and is about to get mated spectacularly. White sacrificed his second rook with 1 Be2! Qxh1 2 Bg4+ f5 3 Bxf5+ Kc7 4 Qa7+ Kd8 5 Qxb8+ Ke7 6 Qxd6+ Kf7 7 Qe6+ Kg7 8 Be5+, and mate follows shortly.</p> <p>This concludes our gambit series - for the time being. Feedback has been so enthusiastic that we will no doubt revisit the theme.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"mailto:chess@guardian.co.uk\">chess@guardian.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Last week there was a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SP_dvjvmR7Q\">mass giveaway</a> of the satirical board game War on Terror outside the doors of Zavvi's Oxford St store.</p> <p>This was sweet revenge on the high street giant which <a href=\"http://www.waronterrortheboardgame.com/presspack/TBG_PR_180808-v2.pdf\">almost bankrupted</a> independent game publishers TerrorBull Ltd.</p> <p>Despite rave reviews in the gaming community, as well as 12,000 sales worldwide, War on Terror was barred from toy fairs and turned down by HMV and Borders, because it was said to be, among other things, \"upsetting to customers\", a \"political minefield\" or merely \"sick and ridiculous\".</p> <p>Then suddenly Zavvi placed an order for 5,000 copies. TerrorBull had to borrow to meet the production target, but it could have been the breakthrough they needed.</p> <p>Sadly, the games were recalled on the very day they went on sale. Zavvi not only returned the order, but refused to pay for a product they now said they did not want. Despite mutterings about \"poor sales\", TerrorBull suspect the real reason had more to do with Zavvi's MD, Simon Douglas, being unaware of the deal \u2013 and throwing his toys out of the pram when he found out.</p> <p>A drawn-out legal battle followed, at the end of which, TerrorBull were not only paid in full, but got to keep half the games they had originally supplied.</p> <p>Hence the giveaway. Since Zavvi had effectively paid for these games, TerrorBull felt it was only fair to give some of them back to potential customers of the store, who then <a href=\"http://www.waronterrortheboardgame.com/wotblog/\">posed for a photo with a \"Thanks, Zavvi!\" speech bubble</a>.</p> <p>This is not the first time that War on Terror \u2013 the board game \u2013 has got up an establishment nose. Earlier this year, it was displayed by Kent police among items <a href=\"http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/cn_news_home/DisplayArticle.asp?ID=338658\">confiscated from environmental protesters</a>. One of the gimmicks included with the game is a balaclava with the word \"evil\" stitched to the forehead. A po-faced spokesperson for the force explained that they had taken the game because the balaclava \"could be used to conceal someone's identity or could be used in the course of a criminal act\".</p> <p>(Quick. Hide the Cluedo, before Police find out about the dagger.)</p> <p>Oddly enough, retailer sensitivity to public feelings does not extend to violent computer games \u2013 such as <a href=\"http://uk.ps2.ign.com/objects/746/746754.html\">Stealth Force: the War on Terror</a>, which has been stocked by Zavvi and other high street chains. </p> <p>That raises some interesting questions about the sort of value system that finds it acceptable to co-opt the nation's youth into blowing people up in the bloodiest, most sadistic way imaginable, while a game that pushes players towards asking meaningful questions about the west's geopolitical strategy is verboten.</p> <p>As Andrew Sheerin, co-creator of the board game, observed: \"If we'd called the game 'Kill the Terrorists' we wouldn't have any problems.\" </p> <p>While I don't subscribe to the theory of an ever-present establishment controlling and directing public debate, the commercial take on War on Terror is worrying. At the very least it suggests that key decision-makers who should to be tuned in to the public mood are incapable of internalising much more than a Daily Mail parody of the same.</p> <p>So, too, is the police reaction. I have plastic bags in my house: I could use them to suffocate someone \u2026 or if I went shoplifting, I could carry my ill-gotten gains away in them. Recycle them at once! Of course the police are \"correct\" in their assessment of the situation \u2013 but if they are going to criminalise people and objects on the basis of the way something \"could\" be used, we need a constitution, a bill of rights, the whole darn shooting match \u2013 and now.</p> <p>And finally, top marks to War on Terror, which seems to be doing everything you could ask of a satirical board game. Recent publicity suggests it could well end up as an unofficial bestseller this Christmas, making its inventors rich while leaving nothing but crumbs to those who spurned it. For once, the good guys may be winning.</p>",

  "<p>Jaime Alguersuari took his third win of the season around the streets of Bucharest yesterday to reignite his title hopes and edge closer to British Formula 3 championship leader Oliver Turvey.</p> <p>Turvey had gained the upper-hand over his Carlin Motorsport team-mate Alguersuari with a pair of wins in the last round, but the Spaniard hit back in Romania and now lies 12 points adrift of his British rival.</p> <p>Alguersuari's victory in the second race \u2013 which marked Carlin Motorsport's 150th win \u2013 came when he overtook rivals and team-mates Turvey and Brendon Hartley, who were caught out while battling over the lead.

I managed to pull a bit of a gap on Oli, and at that point my aim was just to try and control the race. Oli and Brendon have been quicker than me throughout the weekend, so I knew I had to push hard and not make any mistakes. Winning here means I'm still in contention for the championship, the points are still pretty close and I can't wait for Donington.\"</p> <p>New Zealander Hartley had fared better in the first encounter, when he claimed his fifth win of the season \u2013 the most of any driver this year. He led from pole, mastering a re-start following a safety car period and crossing the line ahead of Turvey and Alguersuari in what was a dominant weekend for the Carlin team. Hartley lies third in the championship standings, but with a 30-point deficit to Turvey he remains an outside chance.</p> <p>\"I really like this track,\" said Hartley. \"After a difficult start from pole last weekend at Silverstone, I'm pleased to have shown we can dominate from lights to flag.\"</p> <p>It was a disastrous weekend for Mexican driver Sergio Perez who went into the meeting \u2013 held around the enormous Romanian Parliament building \u2013 lying second in the championship.

  "<p>David Miliband's claim that Nato last week agreed the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/20/georgia.nato\">\"formal process</a>\" of bringing Georgia into membership \u2013 which was immediately <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/21/nato.russia\">contradicted</a> by the organisation's own general secretary, Jaap de Hoop Scheffer \u2013 is the latest of a series of contradictory signals from Britain's foreign secretary.</p> <p>Coming in the same week as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/19/davidcameron.conservatives\">Nick Brown</a>, one of Gordon Brown's closest confidantes, wrote that he did not back Georgia's membership and did not know anyone who does, it reveals the incoherence of Labour's post-Blair foreign policy.</p> <p>When Miliband was first appointed as foreign secretary he initially signalled a break from the Anglo-American imperialism of his predecessors. In his first interview he spoke of the need to \"see the world through Indian eyes\", a reference to the concerns of the global south and the growing importance of their emerging economies. </p> <p>Since Goldman Sachs first grouped the nations of Brazil, Russia, India and China together based on two shared characteristics \u2013 large populations and rapid economic growth \u2013 the so-called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRIC\">Bric nations</a> have been moving towards a real political alliance. A summit, <a href=\"http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/markets/russia/article3941462.ece\">hosted by Russia</a>, this May led to the first political declaration by the Bric bloc \u2013 which was strongly at variance with current US foreign policy. </p> <p>Both Brazil and India share Russia and China's hostility to international military intervention and have tended to vote against resolutions authorising such actions on the UN security council. But as democracies, with left-of-centre governments, they should be Labour's natural allies, particularly if Britain would take more of a lead in addressing their concerns about world trade and global governance.</p> <p>Yet in Miliband's first major <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/feb/12/foreignpolicy.iraq\">speech on foreign policy</a>, this February, he went even further than Blair in endorsing the interventionist doctrine saying that \"something strange happened\" in the 1990s when \"the neoconservative movement seemed more certain about spreading democracy around the world\" than the left. He followed up this completely historically inaccurate assertion by saying that the failures in Iraq had all been down to postwar planning and that future \"interventions in other countries must be more subtle, better planned, and if possible undertaken with the agreement of multilateral institutions\". It is difficult to think of a worse signal to have sent to the rest of the world.</p> <p>In the wake of the devastating cyclone that hit Burma in May Miliband hinted that he was considering using the British military to deliver aid by force \u2013 a quite extraordinary statement given Britain's current military capacity and commitments and Burma's proximity to China.</p> <p>Foreign ministers have a difficult job because their statements need to be weighed for both their domestic and international political impact. They also need to construct a consistent narrative so that, for example, they are not lecturing other countries about human rights while being complicit in the torture of prisoners themselves.</p> <p>This has been at the heart of the dilemma facing successive British foreign secretaries since George Bush began his \"war on terror\" and, to be fair to Miliband, he inherited a set of problems over which he had no control. Neither can foreign ministers pursue policies in isolation from their prime minister and Robin Cook's defiance of Blair over the international criminal court's statute was probably the last demonstration of such independence.</p> <p>Unfortunately, since Miliband all but announced his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/29/davidmiliband.labour\">candidature for the Labour leadership</a> last month, every single instance of perceived differences between him and Brown is coming under the political microscope.</p> <p>His initial response to Russia's invasion of Georgia was actually very well-measured. He correctly condemned it as an aggressive violation of international law and Georgian sovereignty. \"China and the Non-Aligned Movement will be surprised by this new position,\" he caustically noted. He also stated that Georgia's application for Nato membership should remain on track, but he warned against calls for Russia's isolation saying that \"Our response should be to welcome them into systems such as the World Trade Organisation.\"</p> <p>In perhaps the most significant passage he argued: \"I do not support Russia's expulsion from the G8: that would encourage Russian sense of victimhood, fuel Russian revanchism, and allow the Russians to position themselves as the champion of reform for those currently outside the G8.\" Well quite, but splitting Nato hardly sends out the best signals either.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/aug/01/gordonbrown.labour\">Opinion polls</a> show that people do not know what Miliband stands for and this is because he is simultaneously arguing contradictory positions. I would probably have supported him if he had stood for the leadership of the Labour party against Brown last year. A proper election would have helped both candidates to clarify their respective political positions. Now the problem is that we simply do not know when Miliband says something if he is speaking on Brown's behalf, positioning himself against him, or just making it up as he goes along. That is a rather worrying drawback in a foreign secretary in our nuclear age.</p> <p>Most people who know Miliband say that he is an extremely talented, clever and affable person, so it grieves me to say it, but when Brown returns from his holiday, his first task should be to be sack him. </p>",
  "<p>Crucial government funding cuts are \"leaving black youths to die\", an independent advisor to the Home Office warned today.</p> <p>Dr Derrick Campbell said financial support earmarked for community cohesion was not going to the right organisations. </p> <p>His controversial comments came as police appealed for calm in Birmingham after gang violence caused two deaths in the West Midlands in just 24 hours. </p> <p>All three incidents involved black youths and included the shooting dead of Dimitri Foskin, 24, in the Newtown area of Birmingham on Saturday night. </p> <p>Campbell, who is chairman of the National Independent Advisory Group on Criminal Use of Firearms, told the BBC: \"We have clear evidence of organisations which used to be funded and have delivered on outcomes but have suddenly not been supported. </p> <p>\"We have to ask the question whether there seems to be an acceptance that if another black youth is killed they are just another one that we don't have to worry about. </p> <p>\"Black youths within this country have been left to die. And that's a very strong statement but it's a statement that seems to be borne out through evidence about black youths who seem to be at the top of the list when it comes to our youngsters being killed.\"</p> <p>Campbell said there was hard evidence from community groups in the Birmingham area that their level of funding was being cut - a situation that he claimed was reflected nationally. </p> <p>He added: \"Now we're asking very serious questions of national government and local government as to why it seems that resources that have been allocated for community cohesion and other activities have not been going to those organisations.\" </p> <p>A Home Office spokesman told the BBC: \"The government is committed to tackling gun, gang and knife crime and getting weapons off our streets. </p> <p>\"In July we launched the \u00a3100m youth crime action plan which sets out a comprehensive package of tough enforcement and intensive prevention measures as well as more support for parents to tackle offending and reduce reoffending.\"</p>",
  "<p> Robert Browning in 1858. Image: Corbis</p> <p>Browning described the composition of \"Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came\" in terms that attest to its deep source in his own psyche. \"I was conscious of no allegorical intention of writing it ... Childe Roland came upon me as a kind of dream. I had to write it then and there, and I finished it the same day, I believe. I do not know what I meant beyond that, and I do not know now. But I am very fond of it.\"</p> <p>This doesn't mean, of course, that the tale was entirely Browning's invention. The poem's epigraph (\"See Edgar's Sing in Lear\") alludes to <a href=\"http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/Childe-Rowland\">an old Scottish ballad</a> which Edgar, disguised as Mad Tom, quotes in Shakespeare's play, mixing it up with lines from the folk-tale, \"Jack the Giant-Killer\": \"Child Rowland to the dark tower came,/ His word was still 'Fie, foh and fum,/ I smell the blood of a British man.\" But Browning's poem bears little relation to the ballad. </p> <p>It triumphantly avoids any sort of period pastiche. As in the best horror stories and movies, a naturalistic setting and narrative style allow terror and dismay to emerge all the more convincingly. The leisurely build-up is another effective device. The first three stanzas simply show Roland debating with himself whether or not to follow the directions of the sinister, \"hoary cripple\" he has met on the road.</p> <p>The poem's very formality, with its regular and Roman-numbered stanzas marching on with a consistent, dignified, iambic tread, emphasises the seriousness of Browning's project. But is his intention mainly to tell a chillingly good story? Though he denied writing conscious allegory, it is tempting to read the poem as an exploration of an inner state of mind, or even an account of \"the battle with depression\".</p> <p>Many critics have read it that way, for instance the poet <a href=\"http://www.poemhunter.com/thomas-blackburn/\">Thomas Blackburn</a>. In an excellent introductory book, Robert Browning: A Study of His Poetry (The Woburn Press, 1967), Blackburn also wrote that Browning was \"more aware of evil, the shadow side of human nature, than any other poet of his age\". I would go further and suggest that Browning was exceptionally aware of <em>all</em> human psychology.</p> <p>His genius lay in his ability to contain so many unaccommodating aspects of the self in verse, and to give them fresh forms of expression (for example, the dramatic monologue), as well as old forms revitalised. He could be didactic, hearty, clumsy: he wasn't immune to the faults of Victorianism. But his major poems are lit by a blazing intelligence, openness and courage. His range of subjects and ideas is thrilling. He asks the big questions, while keeping close to the daily experience of men and women. As an unusually astute love-poet, as a master of the colloquial voice, and in his unshocked willingness to explore the \"shadow side\", he is still highly relevant to the practice of poets today.</p> <p>\"Childe Roland\" is one of darkest and greatest poems. It's a little long for the blog, so, to whet your appetite for <a href=\"http://www.web-books.com/Classics/Poetry/Anthology/Browning_R/Childe.htm\">the whole poem</a>, I've culled two narrative segments: stanzas 10-14, and the concluding stanzas 30-34. In the first, the young knight has just looked back towards the \"safe road\" behind him, only to find that it has disappeared and there is nothing but \"grey plain\" around him and in front of him. He decides to continue, since \"naught else remained to do\".</p> <p><strong>X</strong> So, on I went. I think I never saw Such starved ignoble nature; nothing throve: For flowers - as well expect a cedar grove! But cockle, spurge, according to their law Might propagate their kind, with none to awe, You'd think; a burr had been a treasure-trove.</p> <p><strong>XI</strong> No! Penury, inertness and grimace, In some strange sort were the land's portion. 'See Or shut your eyes,' said Nature peevishly, 'It nothing skills: I cannot help my case: 'Tis the Last Judgement's fire must cure this place, Calcine its clods and set my prisoners free.'</p> <p><strong>XII</strong> If there pushed any ragged thistle-stalk Above its mates, the head was chopped; the bents Were jealous else. What made those holes and rents In the dock's harsh swarth leaves, bruised as to balk All hope of greenness? 'tis a brute must walk Pashing their life out, with a brute's intents.</p> <p><strong>XIII</strong> As for the grass, it grew as scant as hair In leprosy; thin dry blades pricked the mud Which underneath looked kneaded up with blood. One stiff blind horse, his every bone a-stare, Stood stupefied, however he came there: Thrust out past service from the devil's stud!</p> <p><strong>XIV</strong> Alive? He might be dead for aught I know, With that red gaunt and colloped neck a-strain, And shut eyes underneath the rusty main; Seldom went such grotesqueness with such woe; I never saw a brute I hated so; He must be wicked to deserve such pain.</p> <p>Only Dante, perhaps, has created such a sense of the immanence of evil in a landscape. But Roland meets no villains, fights no demons. The horror is stronger because of the absence of a living antagonist. He continues his desolate journey. There is a river he imagines is full of dead bodies, a ghastly machine (\"That harrow fit to reel/ Men's bodies out like silk\") and an oak whose cleft is \"Like a distorted mouth that splits its rim/ Gaping at death, and dies while it recoils.\" The narrative moves into its final stages with a nightmarish dawning of recognition ...</p> <p><strong>XXX</strong> Burningly it came on me all at once, This was the place! Those two hills on the right, Crouched like two bulls locked horn in horn to fight; While, to the left, a tall scalped mountain ... Dunce, Dotard, a-dozing at the very nonce, After a life spent training for the sight!</p> <p><strong>XXXI</strong> What in the midst lay but the Tower itself? The round squat turret, blind as the fool's heart, Built of brown stone, without a counterpart In the whole world. The tempest's mocking elf Points to the shipman thus the unseen shelf He strikes on, only when the timbers start.</p> <p><strong>XXXII</strong> Not see? Because of night perhaps? -why, day Came back again for that! Before it left, The dying sunset kindled through a cleft: The hills, like giants at a hunting, lay, Chin upon hand, to see the game at bay,- 'Now stab and end the creature - to the heft!' <strong>XXXIII</strong> Not hear? When noise was everywhere! It tolled Increasing like a bell. Names in my ears Of all the lost adventurers my peers, - How such a one was strong, and such was bold, And such was fortunate, yet each of old Lost, lost! One moment knelled the woe of years.</p> <p><strong>XXXIV</strong> There they stood, ranged along the hill-sides, met To view the last of me, a living frame For one more picture! In a sheet of flame I saw them and I knew them all. And yet Dauntless the slug-horn to my lips I set, And blew. 'Childe Roland to the Dark Tower came.'</p>",
  "<p>The news that Oxford University is to take into account whether an applicant comes from one of Britain's poorest postcodes, or has suffered other disadvantages such as having spent time in care, should be good news for those of us who are concerned that the brightest pupils are currently not getting in to the top universities because of the difficulties they faced at school and home. Of course, <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/carol_midgley/article4575556.ece\">Carol Midgley</a> at the Times is right that Oxford \"is simply acknowledging the truth that some A grades are more meaningful than others\", and that such a grade achieved by a student from severely disadvantaged background \"is worth 20 of any A gained by a hothoused child in one of those ruthless exam-passing factories known as private schools.\"</p> <p>Similarly, it doesn't take long to dismiss the adorably wonky argument by the high master of <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2574567/Oxford-University-to-use-postcodes-to-boost-admissions-from-poorer-students.html\">St Paul's school</a>, that the move is \"offensive\", as 18-year-olds should be \"judged on their ability and not on their social background\" \u2013 as though parents sent their children to private schools for any reason other than knowing their offspring will be judged on their social background, and the social background private schools provide might help their children get ahead.</p> <p>It's tempting to draw up the standard battle-lines: the toffs decrying the \"social engineering\" v those of us who can accept that not all As are equal. The problem is, both these responses ignore the minutiae of what is being proposed \u2013 namely, applicants from the poorest postcodes will not necessarily be offered more places, only more interviews.</p> <p>Obviously, in theory, interviews are the fairest way to judge a candidate's potential, particularly when so many university applicants' Ucas forms display the same cartoon mountain-ranges of AAAAs at A-level. As I face down the tarmac-chewing process of studying for the American <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_School_Admission_Test\">LSAT</a>s, it becomes increasingly obvious that standardised tests spectacularly fail as a \"class-free\" mechanism for selecting students \u2013 what happens under the American system is simply that the richest students (or, rather, their parents) throw thousands of dollars at intensive private tuition programmes which guarantee to boost their final result. Even leaving aside these nefarious practices, the very idea that standardised tests can gauge some kind of \"innate\" intelligence that exists irrespective of a student's socialisation is dubious at best. Interviews, on the other hand, are holistic, personal, exploratory \u2013 an antidote to the anonymous, intelligence-as-a-number machinery of A-level results and university entrance exams, a place where students can show their potential to tease out ideas, analyse, think on their feet.</p> <p>That's the theory, anyway. And there's no reason why the Oxbridge interview system could not, one day, live up to it. The problem is, guaranteeing interviews to disadvantaged applicants is likely to change little on its own. Because, as anyone who has sat through one can tell you, it is at this stage of the Oxbridge selection process that socio-economic background comes into play most insidiously.</p> <p>It's more pernicious, and harder to locate, than a simple case of \"money talking\" \u2013 it is the intangible concept of being \"cultured\" that acts as a shibboleth in the interview. The fact that <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1563626/100-schools-%27dominate-Oxbridge-admissions%27.html\">a 2007 study</a> found sixth-formers from private schools were more likely than their state school counterparts to get into Oxford and Cambridge, irrespective of their A-level results, shows it is not merely the oft-stated phenomenon of private schools babysitting even mediocre students into getting straight-As. Unless you really think that being articulate and \"cultured\" is an innate skill that exists beyond socialisation, it is surely the interview-coaching, individual tutoring, and self-confidence instilled by private schools and middle-class state schools that disadvantage applicants from institutions that don't offer these opportunities. When I went for my interview, candidates who were the among the first in their sixth-form to apply to Oxford expressed a degree of negativity about how their interview had gone that seemed to go beyond the usual self-deprecation or post-interview nerves; private school kids and middle-class state school kids almost unanimously claimed their interviews went well, had felt like a \"chat\".</p> <p>I have no illusions that I got into Oxford for any reason other than the fact my highly successful, middle-class state school may as well have been a fee-paying school, in terms of both the socio-economic background of the students, and its singular obsession with getting us into Oxbridge.</p> <p>The Oxford interview felt like a cosy chat for me too. But for many other, brighter, candidates, it may as well have been in a foreign language, whether or not their interviewer made references in Latin. In this context, the observation by the director of Cambridge admissions that interviews are becoming \"<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1563343/Oxbridge-'prefers-interviews-to-exam-results'.html\">more important</a>\" in the admission decision no longer feels like an unqualified positive step, but merely that children from the poorest backgrounds will stumble at a later stage of the application process.</p> <p>Offering more interviews to students who have faced considerable difficulties in obtaining their top A-level grades is obviously a step in the right direction. But the idea that it will result in more places for capable students from \"disadvantaged backgrounds\" is far too optimistic. I don't have the perfect answer: to come up with a comprehensive solution to the problem of Oxbridge's place in Britain's class system \u2013 just, you know, off the top of my head \u2013 sounds like something they'd ask you in an Oxford interview itself. </p> <p>The usual proposals \u2013 full-blown affirmative action, systematically improving our state schools, punitive measures to discourage the use of private schools \u2013 are either unachievable or undesirable. But, while we continue to look for an ideal solution, perhaps we could defuse the worst effects of the current system by no longer collectively fetishising Oxford and Cambridge over other universities. The names only have cachet in wider society if we let them: stripped of their emperor's news clothes, they're really just two pretty places where the middle-classes ponce around for a bit.</p>",

  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/aug/19/uksecurity.alqaida\">conviction</a> of Hammaad Munshi as Britain's \"youngest terrorist\" \u2013 he was a 16-year-old about to take his GCSEs when he was arrested two years ago - marks an appalling new low in the use of <a href=\"http://www.opsi.gov.uk/Acts/acts2000/ukpga_20000011_en_6#pt6-pb1-l1g58\">section 58</a> of the Terrorism Act 2000 which states:</p> <blockquote> <p>A person commits an offence if ... he collects or makes a record of information of a kind likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism.</p> </blockquote> <p>I argued previously on Cif during the case of the \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/dec/06/donteventhinkaboutit\">lyrical terrorist</a>\" that this is a vaguely-worded piece of legislation that seeks to criminalise people's thoughts. In effect, it says that if you possess material that teaches you how to make explosives, even if you are just reading it and do not intend to do anything wrong, well, someone else who reads it may - so, er, you are guilty.<br> Let's look at what had Hammaad Munshi is actually said to have done. According to all accounts of the case, Munshi surfed the internet and is said to have downloaded material about the making of napalm and other explosives. He also had \"al-Qa'ida propaganda videos\" on his PC.  So what? That's freedom folks. Just think how many British teenagers have got hold of the Anarchist's Cookbook over the years and how much easier the internet has made it to seek out and read such material? How many of them went on to become terrorists? And if people want to download videos of US army tanks being blasted apart by Iraqi resistance fighters then that is surely their own business, right? Where have all the \"free speech\" warriors gone now?  Note that Munshi was not convicted of any actual plan to carry out a terrorist attack \u2013 it is just presumed that that is what he would have graduated to do because the state now wants to have the right to police our minds. Oh, I nearly forgot: \"Two bags of ballbearings \u2013 described as the shrapnel of choice for suicide bombers - were found in one of his pockets.\" Well, I suppose there could not possibly be any lawful reason why a person might have some ball-bearings in one of their pockets. In court, Munshi's lawyers tried unsuccessfully to argue that he had collected the internet material out of teenage 'curiosity'. </p> <p>Munshi is due to be sentenced in September and faces up to 10 years in jail. <br> The continuing reluctance of Muslim organisations to speak out forcefully against the malicious use of anti-terror legislation in cases such as this is deplorable. It appears that many of them are either too afraid to raise their voices for fear of being branded as terrorist sympathisers and \"fellow travellers\" or are worried that they might lose lucrative Preventing Violent Extremism money from the government. They should be ashamed of themselves. For too many young British Muslims like Munshi, the UK has come to resemble a republic of fear.  While there is undeniably a terror threat to this country, it is also apparent that this government has been more than eager to exaggerate the extent of the danger posed by people like Munshi in order to generate panic and fear among us. All the better to distract us from the horrific scale of their own misdeeds due to their warmongering abroad. Of course, members of the government who lied to us in order to shore up support for an illegal invasion of a sovereign country that posed no threat to us could never be thought of as terrorists.</p>",
  "<p> Ah, the August Bank Holiday Monday - traditionally a day in which we all pack up our stuff and head home after a damp weekend of over-priced accommodation and breath-takingly mediocore pub grub.

It will be interesting to see if there's at least Bluetooth support for multiplayer gaming - a full online mode would be even better. Destruction Derby, the smash 'n' crash racing series which started out on PS1, is a less obvious fit, though driving games are doing decent business on mobile, despite being overwhelmingly rubbish.

It's also innovative for its planned episodic nature - this is the first in a series.\"</p> <p><strong>GTS World Racing</strong> \"Another iPhone game, this time a 3D racer. The controls are entirely accelerometer-based, and are pretty bang on - certainly less frustrating than Super Monkey Ball.\"</p> <p><strong>Tony Hawk's Proving Ground</strong> \"Mobile Tony Hawk games were once fiddly and distinctly un-fun, but this continues the trend set by Tony Hawk's Project 8 of being a great mobile game, designed around the handset's limitations rather than fighting them.\"</p> <p><strong>Circulate</strong> \"A good example of one of the genres mobile does best - a brain-bending puzzler with simple controls, but a well-planned learning curve introducing new features as you progress.\"</p> <p><strong>Song Summoner: The Unsung Heroes</strong> \"iPod games are fairly low-profile compared to iPhone at the moment, but this from Square Enix is genuinely innovative. You turn your own songs into warriors for the Final Fantasy Tactics style gameplay.\"</p>",
  "<h2>Live from the Democratic convention </h2> <p>The atmosphere on the streets of downtown Denver ahead of the convention opening today was a strange mixture: part carnival, part tense confrontation between anti-war protesters and hundreds of heavily armed police, many in riot gear ... and, amid it all, the most extensive orgy of Barack Obama-themed merchandising I've yet witnessed. Almost none of it was official: every smalltime entrepreneur within a 500-mile radius, it seemed, had brought a suitcase full of t-shirts, baseball caps, buttons or tea towels - and even the atrociously designed ones will probably find buyers among the 50,000 delegates and countless others expected today in Denver's Pepsi Centre.</p> <p>With no sign of a \"Biden bounce\" in the polls, the pressure on Obama to maintain Democratic unity this week will be even greater, says <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/25/barackobama.joebiden\">Suzanne Goldenberg in today's Guardian</a>.</p> <p>A much-rumoured surprise appearance by Ted Kennedy at the convention tonight could certainly help do that: if his doctors give him permission to attend, it'll be the emotional high point of the day. So might the decision late yesterday to give Michigan and Florida delegates full voting rights - far too late, of course, to make anything but a symbolic difference. The Associated Press is also reporting that Hillary Clinton has released all her delegates to vote as they please in the roll-call vote, meaning that some might switch to Obama.</p> <h2>Today at the convention</h2> <p>Monday's official convention theme is '\"One Nation\", with a focus on Obama's biography - \"a life of struggle, responsibility and opportunity like those faced by Americans every day.\" Michelle Obama is the headline speaker; other highlights include Barack Obama's sister, Maya Soetero-Ng, and his brother-in-law, Craig Robinson, along with House speaker Nancy Pelosi. (Obama himself is on a tour of the midwest.) I'll be liveblogging the big speeches at my <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/oliverburkemanblog?DCMP=EMC-E_EMS_USE\">campaign diary</a>.</p> <h2>On theguardian.com now</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/25/barackobama.democrats2008?DCMP=EMC-E_EMS_USE\">Family guy: Relatives take centre stage at Obama convention</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/25/barackobama.joebiden2?DCMP=EMC-E_EMS_USE\">Michael Tomasky: Obama must go on the attack against McCain</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2008/aug/25/democrats2008.uselections2008?DCMP=EMC-E_EMS_USE\">Michael Tomasky's video blog: Backing Biden</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2008/aug/25/uselections2008.usa?DCMP=EMC-E_EMS_USE\">Video: Paul Harris catches up with an exhibition of presidential memorabilia</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/25/democrats2008.barackobama?DCMP=EMC-E_EMS_USE\">Carnival mood as campaigners take to the street</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/25/barackobama.joebiden?DCMP=EMC-E_EMS_USE\">Editorial: Confidence and caution in Denver</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/25/joebiden.uselections2008?DCMP=EMC-E_EMS_USE\">Jeremy Lott: Biden is the clown in the Democratic party</a></p> <h2>The best of the rest</h2> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/relentless/\">Politico: How Obama outsmarted Clinton</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/24/AR2008082401671.html?hpid=topnews\">Washington Post: Revisiting Obama's 2004 breakout convention speech</a></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> <a href=\"http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2008/08/can-biden-out-hillary-hillary.html\">FiveThirtyEight.com: Can Biden out-Hillary Hillary?</a></p> <h2>Site of the day</h2> <p>At the blog <a href=\"http://blogs.rockymountainnews.com/dnc_as_theater/\">DNC As Theater</a>, Rocky Mountain News drama critic Lisa Bornstein will be covering the convention as the staged spectacle that it is. Meanwhile, there's no point linking to StayRedKansas.com: the Kansas politics blog was so confident in its prediction that Obama would choose Evan Bayh as his running-mate that it promised to shut down if he didn't. He didn't. It did.</p> <h2>Latest polls</h2> <p>Obama maintains a narrow lead over McCain - 49% to 45% - in a Washington Post/ABC poll, while Gallup's tracking poll, partly conducted after Joe Biden emerged as Obama's running-mate, is tied, 45% to 45%. The Washington Post poll gave McCain a strong lead on foreign policy know-how: voters believe he's the more knowledgeable candidate by a ratio of two to one.</p> <h2>Quote of the day</h2> <p>Barack Obama rolled out some ostentatious modesty in response to the soaring expectations for Thursday's nomination acceptance event: \"I am still tooling around with my speech a little bit. I may not be as good as the other headliners the other three nights, but hopefully it'll make clear the choices the American people are going to face in November.\"</p> <h2>... and on the Convention fringes</h2> <p>It's day two of Mediate 08, an all-convention-long interfaith meditation retreat in a park near the Pepsi Centre. Recreate 68, the activist group behind many of Sunday's protests, plans a mid-morning march. And delegates can enjoy 'Sex, Politics and Cocktails', an event hosted by Planned Parenthood - so that's safe sex, presumably.</p>"
