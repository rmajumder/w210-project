  "<p>Men who appear charming one minute and terrifyingly aggressive the next or who put pressure on their partner to have sex are showing early warning signs of domestic abuse, according to a campaign launched by Refuge yesterday.</p> <p>The charity, Britain's biggest single provider of support and accommodation for female victims of domestic violence, said that although most women recognised physical abuse, other subtler forms of control, such as telling women what they could wear, were not recognised as abusive behaviour and could escalate into violence.</p> <p>Refuge also called on the government to do more preventive work by targeting young people in schools.</p> <p>Sandra Horley, chief executive of Refuge, said: \"It is essential that women receive the right education and information so they understand the techniques of control frequently used by abusive men. It is all too easy for women to excuse their partner's possessive and jealous behaviour, but in doing so they run the risk of the abuse increasing in frequency and severity.</p> <p>\"Once she recognises there's a problem she can do something about it. The government spends very little on education campaigns on what is a major social problem.\"</p> <p>According to the Home Office two women in England and Wales are killed by their partner or ex-partner every week and the most recent British Crime Survey reported about 12.9m incidents of domestic abuse against women.</p> <p>But Refuge said the campaign was not only aimed at those in abusive relationships but also at women who may need to make informed decisions about future partners.</p> <p>The charity said a slap or a shove could escalate into a brutal beating and murder, and recognising early signs would save lives. Warning signs which Refuge said women should look for included whether a partner was stopping you from seeing family and friends; being constantly critical and putting you down in public; being excessively jealous and possessive; telling you what to wear, who to see, where to go and what to think; controlling your money, and whether you have started walking on eggshells to avoid making your partner angry.</p> <p>A survey by YouGov, commissioned by the charity, found that half of respondents had experienced at least one of the warning signs, but only a fifth said they would talk to someone about their experiences. Women also wanted to be better educated about domestic violence - 87% said they had received no information about domestic violence at school and wished they had done so. </p> <p>Margaret Moran, head of the all-party parliamentary group on domestic violence, said: \"We need more prevention rather than just picking up the pieces. Research says that it takes on average 35 beatings before a woman seeks help; that's a long way down the road.\"</p>",
  "<p>The use of 50,000-volt electric Taser stun guns by the police is growing, with the \"less-lethal\" weapon used on nearly 2,700 occasions since they were first introduced in England and Wales in 2004, according to Home Office figures published yesterday.</p> <p>The figures show that those incidents included 834 occasions in which the guns were \"discharged\", which involves delivering a disabling shock by firing two electric barbs up to 35ft (10.5 metres). On a further 115 occasions police officers used the Taser for a \"drive stun\", when the gun is pressed against the person and fired like a cattle prod.</p> <p>The Home Office minister, Tony McNulty, said the Taser guns had been available to all authorised firearms officers since 2004 as a less lethal option in situations where officers faced a severe threat of violence. The Home Office also published figures for the first nine months of a trial of the use of the Tasers by non-firearms officers in 10 police forces. They have used the stun guns on 411 occasions - discharging them 57 times - since the pilot scheme began last September. </p> <p>Amnesty International has repeatedly voiced concerns about the use of stun guns by the police. The human rights organisation called for them to be banned in Canada last November after four people died after being Tasered. </p> <p>\"Of course the police have a duty to protect themselves and the community from violent situations, but arming more officers with dangerous weapons without the rigorous training and necessary safeguards could well be a recipe for disaster,\" said Amnesty's arms programme director, Oliver Sprague.</p> <p>McNulty defended their use: \"Tasers have contributed to resolving incidents without injury where otherwise there would have been a real possibility of someone being seriously injured or killed. In a significant proportion of cases ... drawing or aiming the Taser has been enough of a deterrent.\"</p>",
  "<p>Two years ago I read a strange little story in an obscure American magazine for Orthodox Jews, claiming that a descendant of Adolf Hitler had converted to Judaism and was living in Israel. I had heard rumours in Jewish circles for years about \"the penitents\" - children of Nazis who become Jews to try to expiate the sins of their fathers. Could it be true? I dug further and discovered that a man with a family connection to Hitler does indeed live in Israel as an Orthodox Jew. Virtually unnoticed in the English-speaking world, he was exposed seven years ago in an Israeli tabloid. Then he sank from sight. I went to Israel to meet him - and on the way I was plunged into the strange subculture of the Nazi-descended Jews.</p> <p>I am walking through the alleys of the Old City of Jerusalem, to meet Aharon Shear-Yashuv. He is the son of a Nazi. And yet he was a senior rabbi in the Israeli armed forces. He lives in an apartment in the Jewish quarter, near the Western Wall. I walk through a pale gold alley; Orthodox Jewish men in long black coats and round fur hats dart past. He opens the door and looks like every other rabbi I have ever met - a black suit, a beard, a questioning shrug. He takes me into his study, settles into a chair, and says, in a thick German accent: \"My father was in the Waffen-SS.\" </p> <p>He was, he explains, born in the Ruhr Valley in 1940. During the war, his father served on the eastern front with Hitler's elite troops. What did his father do in the Waffen-SS? \"I don't know,\" he says calmly. \"When I grew up I tried to ask, but there weren't really answers.\"</p> <p>He was four when he first met his father. \"I don't remember anything about that,\" he says. It seems he doesn't want to talk about his father; he doesn't describe his conversion in psychological terms but in grand theological and historical ones. \"During my theological studies at university it became clear that I couldn't be a minister in the church,\" he says. \"I concluded that Christianity was paganism. One of [its] most important dogmas is that God became man, and if God becomes man then man also can become God.\" He pauses. \"Hitler became a kind of god.\" </p> <p>So would he have become a Jew even if the Holocaust had never happened, even if his family had been anti-Nazi? He looks surprised. \"Oh yes.\" I try to draw him back to his father, but he seems exasperated. \"Well, you see, he is a father, of course, but ideologically, there was no connection. I was so involved in my conviction that I had found the right path, all the other items no longer had any importance.\" </p> <p>Fragments of the story begin to emerge through the haze of theological reasoning. His father was \"shocked and enraged\" when he went to study Judaism in America, he concedes. \"For him that was the end of the world. 'My son is leaving Germany to study in a Jewish rabbinical seminary!' He told me I was crazy and renounced me as a son.\" When he moved to Israel, his parents pretended that it hadn't happened; they told their neighbours he was still in America. Years later, his sister arranged a meeting with his parents at a station in D\u00fcsseldorf. Shear-Yashuv arrived with a Jewish friend. His father peered out of the train, saw the Jewish stranger, and refused to get off.</p> <p>Today, he believes Germany is doomed. \"People there don't get married, and if they do they have one child,\" he says. \"But the Turks and the other foreigners have many children. So it is a question of time that Germany will no longer be German.\" Why does he think this has happened? \"I think it is a punishment for the Holocaust,\" he says, matter-of-factly. \"Germany will leave the stage of history, no doubt about it.\" But the Jews, by contrast, will never die. This is a neat irony of history that he loves. \"All the great cultures have left the stage of history,\" he says. \"The Romans, the Greeks, the Egyptians, the Babylonians. But this little people, who gave so much to the world, do not.\" He chuckles. \"That is something.\"</p> <p>I walk through the Old City, pondering my encounter with this strange, kindly man. Something seems to be missing from his story. To stand in front of a rabbi whose father was in the SS and to hear he became a Jew because he doubted the Trinity is absurd. So I telephone Dan Bar-On, a professor of psychology at Ben Gurion University, and a world expert on the psychology of the children of perpetrators. He tells me, flatly, pitilessly: \"The motive of the converts is to join the community of the victims. If you become part of the victim community, you get rid of the burden of being part of the perpetrator community.\" He interviewed Shear-Yashuv for his book Legacy of Silence. \"For me,\" he says, \"Shear-Yashuv represents a person who ran away from the past.\"</p> <p>A few days later, I take a tatty bus to the Holocaust memorial Yad Vashem, on a mountain just outside Jerusalem. There is an air of absolute, manufactured silence. In the middle is a glass-and-concrete mausoleum - the memorial. I am here to meet a woman who works in the educational department. She was born in Munich, she told me on the telephone, and she is a convert. I meet her in a cafe on the terrace; it is very chichi, but the wind is blowing in from the desert. She is in her late 30s and her head is covered. Her face is stereotypically German but the mannerisms - her emphatic movements and the soaring cadences of her voice - are all Jewish. </p> <p>I cannot name her, she says. (Apart from Shear-Yashuv, every convert refuses to be named.) She tells me, briskly and crossly, that although her grandparents were not perpetrators in the Holocaust, they were bystanders, anti-semites. Her mother, she explains, still says things like, \"There are a lot of rich Jews in America,\" and her family have what she calls \"a classic German narrative\" about the war. She bunches her fists. \"There were no Jews in these stories and no Nazis in these stories,\" she says. And she imitates them, angrily. \"No, no, there were no Nazis, we are not Nazis. We didn't know any Jews, we didn't know anything.\" How did she feel about it? She pauses, and then says, \"I was annoyed.\"</p> <p>Her favoured word for Germany is \"annoyed\". She was \"annoyed\" when a synagogue recently opened in Munich. \"People said, 'Now we have closed the circle; now everything is fine,'\" she says. \"It was like nothing had happened. But there were 11,000 Jews in Munich before the Holocaust. Where are they now?\" She is annoyed by the affluence of Germany. \"Everything is so clean,\" she says. \"Everything is so ... nice. And here,\" she stares out over the mountains, \"the life is so difficult sometimes.\" </p> <p>Why did she become Jewish? \"Because I was annoyed by how the narrative was fixed,\" she says. She tells me a story from the Midrash, a Jewish commentary on the Bible. There are, it states, non-Jews who are born with Jewish souls. They belong to the Jewish people, and will eventually join them. \"It is only a matter of time,\" she says, speaking very seriously, \"before you learn you should convert.\" I remember Shear-Yashuv said this too. </p> <p>I ask her if she believes that Nazi children convert to expiate the guilt of their parents - but this angers her. \"There is something not right when you do it to get rid of your German burden,\" she says. \"That is not honest in my eyes. Do you stop being the daughter of a Wehrmacht soldier if you are Jewish? No. That is no solution. You don't get rid of it.\" So why is she here? \"To live here, to work here, to be this bridge between two worlds.\" She repeats the word \"bridge\" and she calls it \"exciting\". She talks of her \"motivation package\" and she calls the \"discourse about the Holocaust\" in Germany \"sophisticated\". There is something emotionless about it, something deeply unsaid. And precisely on the stroke of the hour, she looks at her watch and says, \"I have to go now.\"</p> <p>I call Bar-On again. I feel the converts are giving me half-answers, scraps of answers. They talk about despising the Trinity and the terrible things that the Germans did to the Jews, but it seems like they are talking a genocide that doesn't exist, even in their memories. I can't escape the feeling that it is all about something else. </p> <p>I tell Bar-On they talk obsessively about the Trinity. But is incredulity really a reason for abandoning a religion with a three-in-one god for one that still believes bushes talk and that waves are parted by the will of God? \"That is another way of saying what I have already told you,\" he says. \"They want to join the community of the victim. They may have their own way of rationalising it.\"</p> <p>Later that day, I meet a young man. He bounces into a kebab shop on West Jerusalem's main drag. He is 24, handsome and excitable. He tells me, simply, that he hated Germany. \"In Germany I didn't care about anyone,\" he spits. \"I didn't give a fuck.\" He describes a jumbled youth, being thrown out of school, joining the army, rejecting the army. After a while, he drags me off to the Independence Park, sipping a Coke, and telling me how wonderful it all is in Israel. </p> <p>He describes growing up in a small town in industrial western Germany. A terrible anger leaks into his sentences. When I ask him why he converted, he stares at the spindly trees, bunches his arms between his knees like an adolescent boy, and says, \"I hate that question. I don't know.\" He calms down and says that something wasn't right for him in Germany, ever: \"I was always looking for my place. I hated Catholicism. I have hated it since I was 14.\" He educated himself and what he likes about Judaism, he says, is that \"what counts is the deed. In Christianity it is enough just to believe.\"</p> <p>\"I didn't think of my family of being like 'the Germans',\" he says. \"I didn't say, 'Grandfather, did you kill anyone?' My grandmother said, 'As kids under the Nazis, before the war, we had a wonderful time. They sent us to Croatia, they sent us to Sweden, and we had youth camps. How could we not be thankful for what they gave us?'\" The Holocaust was just a subject you learned in history, he says. \"You went in the classroom twice a week, they told you, you fell asleep.\"</p> <p>But he tells me one of his grandmother's anecdotes about Nazism. \"She remembers Kristallnacht,\" he says. \"She was 13. She says she remembered there were Jewish shops that got burned down and it was a big loss. Because, she said, you could always go to the Jews and buy something and if you didn't have the money you could bring it in next time.\" </p> <p>And that is his family. He never asked them about the war - I have yet to meet a convert who has. According to Bar-On, converts and their parents almost never speak about the war. He calls it the \"double wall\": both the parent and child erect a wall of silence; even if one tries to break it, the other will keep it firmly in place. </p> <p>This man told his parents he was converting one Christmas Day. He has had death threats from neo-Nazis, he says. His hometown is full of them. Why does he think they became neo-Nazis? \"Ask them - don't ask me,\" he replies. Did he become Jewish because of the Holocaust? \"People ask me that a lot,\" he says, \"and when I say no they don't believe me.\" Does he really believe that? \"Maybe.\" He sighs and looks around at the trees. \"Maybe what the war made Germany into ...\" He pauses and then says, \"I feel myself turning into a block of ice every time when I go back. I have to force myself to melt down again.\" </p> <p>I call Bar-On a final time. They all say they are happy now, I tell him. Is this true? The conversion \"may give them an illusion of peace\", he says. \"But it is not the way to work through the role of the parents [in the war]. I think it is running away from it. In order to be able to really work through the past, you have to try to understand how could it be that your father was a mass murderer. You have to think of the possibilities that had you lived at this time you might also have been able to do such things.\" </p> <p>Is he telling me that they are always wondering what they would have done in Nazi Germany to the Jews they have become? \"Being in Israel is to keep away as far as possible from it,\" he replies. \"I am not sure to what extent they have really been accepted into Israeli society. I think they are struggling. I don't envy them.\"</p> <p>As far as I can tell, the converts may know of each other, but they do not come together. In Judaism it is a sin to point the finger at a convert. And why would they? They are not here to be German; they are here to be Jewish.</p> <p>I return to the suburbs to meet an artist. This convert is also a member of an organisation that promotes human rights for Palestinians. An incredibly beautiful woman answers the door and I say hello. \"Oh, no,\" she says. \"You are not here to speak to me - you are here to speak to my girlfriend.\" The woman I have come to interview is small and wiry, with short hair; she says she is 42. She speaks very, very fast. The words pour out of her. </p> <p>She sits me down and gives me cake and coffee. I say I have interviewed a lot of converts. \"Are they all mad?\" she asks me, and laughs. What does she mean? \"Well,\" she says, \"I met some who surprised me. Some of them were shockingly unintelligent. I even wondered why they would have the intellectual independence to make this choice - especially the people who chose to be ultra-Orthodox, who chose to throw away their freedom.\" She shrugs. \"There is stigma in conversion,\" she says. \"People end up being fanatics.\"</p> <p>She sips her coffee and says that she believes there is a parallel between the way that some Jews respond to the Palestinians and the way some Germans responded to the Nazis. She never asked her grandmother about the war, she says, because she loved her too much. \"I was worried I would get hurt by information I didn't want to know,\" she says. \"Sometimes I feel that a lot of Israelis live that way. It is better not to ask questions, and not be hurt, and so you don't have to look at yourself or your family or your nation. And you can live with the illusion of who is good and who is bad.\"</p> <p>She says she was eight years old when she first heard of a Jew. \"I heard a boy next door call another boy a 'stupid Jew',\" she says. \"I asked my mother, 'What is a Jew, and is it something bad?'\" </p> <p>When she learned about the Holocaust, it literally made her retch. \"I was horrified by what Germans did to Jews,\" she says. \"I was physically disgusted. And I was totally disgusted by even my own Germanness.\" It is strange to hear things like this over coffee in a clean apartment in the Middle East. \"I didn't want to be German,\" she says. \"And because this entered my mind so early, it became as natural as brushing my teeth.\"</p> <p>So why did she convert? She grimaces. \"It isn't rational. We are talking about religion here.\" But she says she ran away to Israel to convert when she was 25. And today, she berates herself for her immaturity in doing it. She was shocked by the racism in Israel. Towards her? \"Towards the Arabs,\" she replies. \"I felt that I was being told that to be a good Jew, you had to hate Arabs.\" So she stands at West Bank checkpoints to observe the behaviour of Israeli soldiers towards Palestinians. </p> <p>\"It causes a lot of tension to come here and say the things that I say,\" she says. So why does she say them? \"Because it would be very inconsistent to have had so much criticism of Germans who were terrible cowards when it was still possible to say something, and then to come here and not speak up for justice.\"</p> <p>She is through with Israel. She says it is because of the triple whammy of otherness - German, leftwing, gay. A shrink would say that she came here to be wrong, I tell her. \"Don't think I haven't thought about it in those terms myself,\" she replies. \"I had wanted to connect myself to a history I did not perceive as shameful. Now I am wondering if I will stay. I am more or less sure that I won't. Sometimes I feel I am not built for it, that I am not strong enough for this country.\" She runs her hands through her hair briskly, and shakes her head. \"Sometimes I feel that just by existing I am always wrong here. But I cannot live with personal attacks now. I cannot bear it.\"</p> <p>Later that day, I meet the man who brought me here to Israel, the man who started all this - the so-called Jewish Hitler. He is a professor at the Jewish studies faculty at one of the universities. I telephoned him, and to my surprise he answered. How could I ask: \"Are you a Hitler?\" I told him I was writing a story about German converts to Judaism, and he said I could come over immediately. So I go to an apartment just around the corner from where the artist lives. It is a grimy white block, with a few scrubby bushes outside. </p> <p>I walk upstairs and a woman with the headscarf of all married orthodox Jewish women answers the door. She doesn't say anything, simply gestures for me to sit at a table in a room heaving with books. And then he comes in. Is this my Jewish Hitler? He is incredibly tall and slim, in a blinding yellow shirt, very animated, and his accent - an odd pulp of German, English and Hebrew - seems to zoom out of him. He is holding two pieces of paper. One is a family tree; the other is a printout of an account of the life of Alois Hitler Junior - Adolf Hitler's half-brother. </p> <p>\"I will tell you the whole story,\" he says, \"on the condition that you do not print my name\". He places the first piece of paper in front of me, points at names, and begins a strange, almost incomprehensible account of the lives of Germans who died more than a century ago. At the end of each summary of a long finished life, he jabs his finger on the table and says, \"OK?\" It only becomes clear what he is doing when I follow the tree down to a name I know - Alois Hitler. </p> <p>Alois Hitler had two sons who lived to maturity - Adolf (that Adolf) and Alois Junior. This half-brother of the F\u00fchrer then produced an illegitimate son called Hans. \"OK?\" he says. \"Hans married my grandmother Erna after she divorced my grandfather.\" </p> <p>He immediately states that he hates the Hitler branch of his family. He becomes agitated. \"I have neither any blood nor DNA from Adolf and his family,\" he insists. \"I was not socialised by that family.\" He met Hans only once. The Hitlers came for tea when he was 12 years old. \"Hans was a very nice man,\" he says. \"No passions, no brutality.\" But Erna was thrilled to have married into the Hitler clan, and remained a Nazi until she died. \"I didn't know her,\" he says of his grandmother. \"She wasn't part of my family.\"</p> <p>The professor explains that his mother severed all connections with the Hitlers. As a teenager she was beaten for refusing to go to Hitler Youth dances, and when she gave birth to the professor - an illegitimate child she conceived during an affair with a married man - her mother and stepfather disowned her. He was raised in a series of rented rooms, while the Hitlers lived well. After the war, his grandmother changed her name, but her beliefs remained. </p> <p>He begins to tell me what happened to his mother during the war. She worked as a typist for the Wehrmacht in Poland and she saw dead Jews hanging in the town squares. \"She was a girl in the war,\" he says, \"but I always appreciated that she told me the truth about it. We spoke frankly. I never heard that normal German lie you hear so often from that generation.\" His voice rises and he impersonates them with a fierce whine: \"'We didn't know, we just did our duty.'\" And he thumps the table. \"My grandparents never understood what they had done,\" he says. \"My mother understood.\" When she came home after the Allied victory, she was denounced as a Nazi, and the Communists seized her flat. \"She became one of those German ladies who cleared up after all the bombing.\" He stomps to the kitchen and comes back, thrusting two silver spoons at me. \"That is all that my mother brought home from the war. I keep them to honour her.\"</p> <p>It was a brutal childhood: he barely saw his father, and his mother beat him - one time so severely that she couldn't go to work for three days because her fingers were too swollen to type. \"She was a fighter,\" he says. \"It is not the nicest thing you can be.\" Was she religious? He gives a deranged giggle. \"She had the religion of herself,\" he says. </p> <p>His mother was entirely alone. \"Nobody helped anybody at that time,\" he says. His father had another family - a real family: \"I saw my father very seldom and the times I saw him I was so proud to have a father that it was not the time to ask what he did in the war. He died when I was 19. So I never asked him what he did.\" But he does know his father was a major in the Wehrmacht. So, barring a miracle, he killed people for Hitler.</p> <p>His journey towards Judaism was long. \"It was not a sudden light from heaven that came down.\" When he was a teenager he met a girl who was interested in Judaism, and he read Mein Kampf. \"I was embarrassed when I read it,\" he says. \"How could people be so stupid as to elect a person who was writing things like this? It's awful.\" He blinks at me. \"I don't think you can really understand how awful it is if you don't read it in German. I put it away. But I keep it here.\" Did he ever finish it? He scowls at me for the first and only time. \"No.\" </p> <p>When the time came for him to be conscripted into the German army, he decided to take a theology degree, because he wanted to benefit from an ironic leftover from Nazism: Hitler promised the Pope in 1933 that he wouldn't conscript priests, and the law has never been repealed. \"I am a pacifist,\" he says. \"You raise up an army if you think you have to use it.\" As part of the degree, he was due to spend six weeks in Israel in the early 1970s. \"I felt at home. I was no longer living in a conflict. I didn't have to reject the older generation. And I thought I had met for the first time a nationality that at that point in history - today it is more problematic - still had good reasons to be proud of itself.\" So he stayed.</p> <p>We go out on to the balcony to smoke. He really enjoys his cigarette; I can see he is a pleasure-savouring man. He does not have the heaviness of the other converts, who all seemed crushed by an invisible burden. Is it because he spoke to his mother about it all? I steel myself and ask: would he have become Jewish without the Holocaust? \"I think not,\" he says. \"The sharp distinction between the generations that committed the crimes and the generation born after wouldn't exist. Non-Germans hardly understand that a whole generation checked out our teachers and asked, 'Where were you 20 years ago?'\"</p> <p>And then, to my surprise, he calls his son - his Israeli son - a fascist. \"When I hear my own son speak - as I did last weekend - I sat like this,\" and he does the Hitler salute. \"Two of my sons are chauvinists and one of them is even partially racist. I can't listen to fascistic discourse. I don't suffer that.\" They talk about the Palestinians with contempt. \"Each time I hear it is another time too much. If the Holocaust and the Third Reich have really somehow shaped me, I am a sworn democrat. I believe that democracy has to prove itself by keeping the rights of its minorities.\" </p> <p>I have been with this man for three hours, insistently asking why - why did you convert? Why? This stray branch of the Hitler family tree stares out at his dull suburban street at the heart of the Jewish state, puffs on his cigarette, and begins to talk about the images of the Holocaust that linger in his mind. \"I see that soldier trampling that child and in the end killing it, and I remember that kind of aggression. I remember the feeling of the child, too. I remember both. I could see my father or my grandfather really standing there.\" </p> <p>And as he says this, his shoulders seem to relax. He is giving me my answer. \"And all I can say, Tanya,\" he says from inside his little cloud of smoke, \"is that since I came to Israel, that feeling isn't there any more.\"</p>",
  "<p>James Benamor, a likably awkward and refreshingly down-to-earth multimillionaire from Bournemouth, travels to Manchester's infamous Moss Side, keen to put something back. With a troubled past himself, James can identify with much of what he finds. He's visibly moved by the plight of people less fortunate than himself, choking up when he meets a woman who lost her son to gun crime. James throws himself into philanthropy with the same energy and enthusiasm he gives his day job. The end result is that the campaign group Mothers Against Violence gets a cheque for \u00a350,000, as do a couple who have opened up their home to homeless teenagers; a place for kids who don't fit in to traditional education gets \u00a336,000. James makes some new friends, Moss Side gets a new hero, and we at home see the return of an inspirational television programme (with a lovely soundtrack by Toots and the Maytals and Finley Quaye) that demonstrates the importance of giving.</p> <p>That's one way of looking at <strong>The Secret Millionaire</strong> (Channel 4). Not the only one, mind. You could see it quite differently ... James Benamor has made his multi-million-pound fortune through exploiting the poor and the destitute, running a company that offers loans (typical APR: 23.1%) to people who have been refused them by other institutions. \"I spend my life trying to block out other people's needs,\" he says. \"Everyone does.\" </p> <p>It's his competitiveness, which is a little bit scary, that motivates him. \"There isn't a company out there that we compete with that I don't want to see smashed into the ground,\" he says. And he admits it's this competitiveness, rather than any sense of doing the right thing, that has pushed him into philanthropy. \"Emotion isn't coming into this at the moment,\" he says. \"For me, this is still a business decision - you know, this is outlay versus reward.\"</p> <p>So James spends a few days in Moss Side deceiving people, pretending to be a poor volunteer (the outlay, presumably). And then he reveals his true identity and laps up the adulation (the reward, which feels all the better for being on TV). Hey, I'm not a volunteer at all, I'm Father Christmas. Do you really think I drive a Nissan Sunny? There's a Lotus at home, I'm on the Sunday Times Rich List: \u00a377m. Thank you, poor people, for making me feel better about myself - have a cheque. And maybe when the money runs out, you can come and see me about a loan (typical APR 23.1%).</p> <p>It's some kind of sickening egotistical power-trip. And the fact that he's doing it on TV makes it more horrid still, though of course he probably wouldn't do it if it wasn't on TV, as that would be removing most of the reward. What would be the point of giving without anyone knowing about it?</p> <p>Truth is, I don't know which is the right way of looking at The Secret Millionaire. Help, anyone? I suspect it's somewhere between the two, rather boringly. Maybe a little further towards B than A.</p> <p>God, what a killer <strong>Olympic Dreams</strong> (BBC1). Devastating. I was almost in tears several times. Alex Partridge loses his place in the coxless four (the rowing boat without the short-arse at the back). Come in Alex, your time is up. That's life, I suppose, but it happened to him at the last Olympics, too, because of a fractured rib. </p> <p>Poor Jess Ennis, a big heptathlon hope, isn't going at all. A bone in one of her feet has stress fractures. Heptathlete's foot, it's known as, in the business. And now, everything Jess has been working towards, the focus of her life since she was 12 years old, has been smashed into the ground. No wonder she looks so incredibly sad. </p> <p>Thank heaven for little Tom Daley, our diving wunderkind, who is going. </p> <p>If I have one little moan about this series, it's that Tamsin Greig has narrated it. I like Tamsin very much, I think she's a brilliant actor. But I'm not convinced she has the voice for Olympic sport. There's a whininess about it. I think Love Soup's to blame, that dreadful show about her being single. Now it doesn't matter what she's talking about, it sounds as if she's whittering on about not having a boyfriend. Maybe you can go out with Alex the rower, now he's got some time on his hands. Oh, except he is going to Beijing after all, but in the eight (the longer rowing boat, which does have a short-arse at the back). </p> <p>That's a minor quibble, though, in what has been a lovely series. My appetite is now thoroughly whetted - for hours of prime sofa-time, getting excited about things I have no understanding of. Let the Games begin.</p>",
  "<p>The leader of one of the most powerful militias in Iraq, Moqtada al-Sadr, is to order his followers to disarm and transform themselves into a purely social and political organisation, according to a new strategy document published yesterday.</p> <p>Such a shift would mark a significant step forward for US and Iraqi government attempts to pacify Iraq. </p> <p>Sadr's Mahdi army, committed to forcing US troops out of Iraq, has been behind much of the violence since the 2003 invasion. His forces have maintained a ceasefire since May.</p> <p>According to the document, a copy of which has been obtained by the Wall Street Journal and whose authenticity has been confirmed by a Mahdi army spokesman, Sheikh Salah al-Obeidi, the militia will concentrate in future on education, provision of social services and religion.</p> <p>It tells Sadr's followers that \"it is not allowed to use arms at all\". Posters have been spotted around Baghdad saying the changes will be announced at Friday prayers.</p> <p>Sadr's shift comes after a crackdown by Iraqi forces on the Mahdi army in its Baghdad stronghold, Sadr City, as well as Amarrah and Basra in the south earlier this year.</p> <p>US military and diplomatic sources yesterday welcomed the prospect of the Mahdi army laying down its arms, but expressed strong scepticism, given previous statements by Sadr that were followed by renewed outbursts of violence. </p> <p>Despite the US caution, the document is consistent with recent statements by Sadr, who was in Iran earlier this year pursuing religious studies. He appears to be readying himself for elections scheduled for October, though the failure of Iraqi parliamentarians to reach a deal yesterday could push that into next year.</p> <p>The new document is in line with a statement from Sadr last week in which he called for the Iraqi government not to enter into any deals with the US government, which he continued to refer to as \"the occupier\". But significantly he called for peaceful resistance to the US forces.</p> <p>The Mahdi army, a predominantly Shia Muslim grouping, and al-Qaida in Iraq have been two of the biggest forces behind much of the violence of the last five years. The Pentagon claims that it has al-Qaida, an almost exclusively Sunni Muslim organisation responsible for some of the worst atrocities, on the run. </p> <p>There has been a reduction in violence in Iraq over the last year and the US commander in Iraq, General David Petraeus, has hinted he will recommend to President George Bush later this month or early next a reduction in the 156,000 US troops based in Iraq and supply bases in Kuwait.</p> <p>The Mahdi army spokesman, Obeidi, told the Wall Street Journal that the group would now be guided by spirituality rather than battling US forces. The document says the aim is promoting virtue and preventing vice through words and moral behaviour. But some hardliners in the Mahdi army may ignore Sadr's call, as they have in the past when he called short-lived ceasefires. </p> <p>Sadr, 34, one of the most influential Shia leaders in Iraq, rose to prominence after the fall of Saddam Hussein. He came from one of the most important religious families in the forefront of resistance to Saddam and which suffered at his hands.</p> <p>Amid the chaos of post-invasion Iraq, Sadr's militia seized control of Sadr City and other Shia areas and established security as well as a basic welfare network. His forces have since repeatedly engaged US and British troops in open battle. </p> <p>British forces have been less involved since handing over Basra city to Iraqi forces and holing up at Basra international airport.</p> <p>The Ministry of Defence denied a report in yesterday's Times that the 4,000 troops had stood by for a week in March while Iraqi and US troops clashed with the Mahdi army because they had a secret deal with Sadr.</p> <p>The British military and diplomats, while responsible for southern Iraq, did enter into a series of deals in places such as Amarrah, while publicly denying it. They allowed militia groups a degree of control. But the MoD insisted yesterday that British forces in March had provided a \"raft of support\" to US and Iraqi forces during the March fighting. </p> <p>In a separate development, Ron Suskind, a US journalist, claimed yesterday that the White House had faked a letter purporting to establish a link between Saddam and al-Qaida in the run-up to the war. The letter, published in the Daily Telegraph, was supposedly written by Tahir Jalil Habbush al-Tikriti, director of Iraqi intelligence, in 2001. </p> <p>The allegation is made in Suskind's new book, The Way of the World. The then acting head of the CIA, George Tenet, said he had no memory of such a letter.</p>",
  "<p>The government is proposing to cap the impact of regulation on business by introducing a system of annual departmental regulatory budgets that would force individual government departments to cost any new regulations and offset them by ditching obsolete measures.</p> <p>The move, to be announced by the Department for Business, Enterprise &amp; Regulatory Reform (BERR) today, would be a world first and is designed to control the estimated \u00a313.4bn spent by companies each year on complying with regulations.</p> <p>The Better Regulation Executive (BRE), part of BERR, is already working with business to reduce this burden by a quarter within the next two years and it hopes to be able to introduce regulatory budgets by the start of the next financial year.</p> <p>William Sargent, the BRE head and former chairman of the Small Business Council, said: \"The government is intending to have a budget for what it spends in regulatory costs in the same way it does for departmental spending.\"</p> <p>The proposals, which are open to consultation until November, could result in the 18 government departments being held back from introducing regulations unless they can cut in other areas.</p> <p>\"You look at the existing stock of regulation, which are already a cost to the economy, from which you are able to make savings, plus your new regulations, which have a cost to them,\" explained Sargent. \"You could imagine a situation where the budget is zero, where you say every pound of cost that we need to bring in for new regulations can be offset by savings.\"</p> <p>Regulatory budgets were suggested by the Better Regulation Task Force three years ago. The cabinet would set the overall budget and divide it between departments, which would also be able to trade their budgets with each other.</p> <p>\"If someone gets out of line and they are going over budget, they must account to parliament,\" Sargent added.</p> <p>The scheme does not include regulations introduced to tackle climate change, an area where business is likely to feel the pinch over the coming years. \"Getting the methodology right is going to be critical,\" Sargent explained. \"The area of climate change is very complicated and we felt it was safest to park it to one side and focus on the normal day-to-day regulation.\"</p> <p>The BRE will also publish proposals to improve guidance on health and safety regulations today in an attempt to save small businesses more than \u00a3300m a year. The average company spends an estimated 20 hours a year, or more than \u00a3350, on administration needed to meet the requirements. But many companies are spending too much time and effort on compliance because they do not fully understand what is required of them, according to a new report from BRE.</p>",

  "<p>The child psychiatrist Cecil Todes, who has died aged 77, cycled from London to Brighton when he was 54. What made this feat remarkable was that, by then, he had already suffered from Parkinson's disease for 15 years. He had fought the disease from the day he was diagnosed and brought his remarkable insights to bear in a memorably frank book, Shadow Over my Brain, published in 2000. He initially sought a psychoanalytic explanation for his illness, believing that something in his childhood, perhaps some unresolved conflict, may have caused it, and for two decades he underwent just about every standard and experimental medical treatment as well as a range of alternative therapies, some of them bizarre. But the only treatment of any lasting significance was the chemical dopamine. </p> <p>Todes was born in Johannesburg, South Africa, the son of Lithuanian-Jewish immigrants; his mother died a painful death from gallstone complications three weeks before his seventh birthday. Educated at King Edward VII school, Johannesburg, he attended Witwatersrand University, where he qualified as a dentist but, uncomfortable with apartheid, he emigrated to Britain in 1954. He worked as a dentist while studying for a higher qualification, the fellowship in dental surgery of the Royal College of Surgeons. Yet, by then he realised that dentistry was not for him, preferring a career in psychoanalysis. </p> <p>In pursuit of his new ambition he entered the West London medical school, which took mature students, in 1957, qualifying in 1960, and spent two years working in junior hospital jobs before heading to New York in 1962 to work in an analytically based psychiatric hospital. He then worked in a busy mental hospital in Boston attached to Harvard University. While waiting to go to the US he had met an American girl, Lili Loebl, who walked into his practice needing treatment. She was the Newsweek correspondent to the United Nations. They married in 1964.</p> <p>Returning to Britain, he worked at Halliwick hospital and the Tavistock clinic, both in north London, the latter run by the distinguished child psychiatrist John Bowlby, author of the classic study Child Care and the Growth of Love. From there he moved to the Hampstead child therapy clinic, run by Anna Freud, daughter of Sigmund, over whose methods they quarrelled.</p> <p>During this time he rented an attic with a brass bed from the writer Beryl Bainbridge, with whom he remained friends. He later worked at Paddington Green children's hospital under child psychiatrist Donald Winnicott, who wrote the important work The Child, the Family and the Outside World. </p> <p>He was 39 when he noticed a tremor in his left hand. It was his daughter's fourth birthday party. His GP immediately diagnosed Parkinson's. Within a year he started searching for a cure. L-dopa, a drug which increases dopamine levels, had just been discovered. Though his symptoms were mild, it was then thought that drugs might alter the course of the disease, so he took large doses, which sometimes caused grimacing. </p> <p>Over the next 20 years he tried every therapy under the sun. He tinkered with doses of Sinemet, a tablet containing L dopa and other chemicals, which made him manic when he took too little and caused grimacing when he took too much. He had crises when he was off work and sometimes in hospital, and took early retirement when he was 57. </p> <p>He went doctor-shopping, bypassing his GP, trying acupuncture, and biofeedback, a once fashionable procedure to bring the body under control, as well as taking dangerous doses of iron, enduring a nonsensical elimination diet and prescription anti-Parkinson drugs. A drug called teguride showed promise but caused psychosis in overdose; Dr Jos\u00e9 Obeso at the Opus Dei hospital in Pamplona, Spain, was trialling it using a continuous pump called a bomba. He went there for treatment in the mid-1980s and found it so horrific that, aided by Lili, he did a moonlight flit. In 1988 he underwent, under local anaesthetic, a transplant of fetal brain cells. It didn't work. </p> <p>A year later he had a heart attack and, having neglected his physical fitness, the rehab he was prescribed did more for his Parkinson's than any other treatment. He continued in private practice until 1992, treating patients at his home. </p> <p>Todes loved music and was a regular at London's Wigmore Hall. </p> <p>He is survived by Lili, two sons and a daughter. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Cecil Jacob Todes, child psychiatrist, born May 29 1931; died June 5 2008</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article was amended on Wednesday August 13 2008.

  "<p>It was by chance, in 1948, that samples from the portfolio of the designer and illustrator Pauline Baynes, who has died aged 85, came to the attention of JRR Tolkien. At that time Tolkien was famous for just one book, his children's novel, The Hobbit, which had been published to great acclaim 11 years earlier. The medieval style of some of Baynes's drawings were ideally suited for Tolkien's Farmer Giles of Ham, which he had also written before the second war, but which was only to be published in 1949. Baynes produced pen and ink drawings and three coloured plates, which Tolkien humorously maintained reduced his text to a \"commentary\". </p> <p>At the end of the 1940s another author, and good friend of Tolkien, was CS Lewis, and he also liked Baynes's illustrations. The result was a commission to illustrate the book for which both author and illustrator are best remembered, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, published in 1950. Six more volumes were to follow of what would be known as the Chronicles of Narnia, concluding with The Last Battle, in 1956.</p> <p>Baynes went on to become one of the foremost children's book illustrators of the 20th century. Her highly designed style - witty, inventive and invariably bursting beyond the borders of the page - her strong sense of colour and line, and her careful attention to detail would become instantly recognisable. As for Narnia, despite other artists ringing the changes from time to time with the covers, sometimes disastrously, it is her classic line drawings which have remained an integral part of every subsequent edition of the series.</p> <p>Born in Brighton, Baynes was the younger of the two daughters. She spent the first few years of her life in India, where her father was employed in the civil service. At the age of five she returned to England with her mother and sister, Angela, and lived in a series of hotels and rented rooms, in and around Farnham, in Surrey, when she was not boarding at the now defunct Beaufront girl's school in Camberley. Later she was educated at the Farnham School of Art and - for two terms only - at the Slade School of Art in London. She studied design, but never gained any formal qualification.</p> <p>During the second world war, because of her art training, she made models for the Royal Engineers' camouflage unit (1940-42), then at Farnham Castle. She then moved to the Admiralty's hydrographics department in Bath (1942-45), drawing maps and nautical charts.</p> <p>Contact with a publisher colleague in the camouflage unit led to her first professional commissions in the early 1940s. By the end of the decade she had amassed a respectable body of published work. Then came Tolkien, and indeed, when The Hobbit appeared in a single print run as a Puffin edition in 1961, she provided the cover for it.</p> <p>It could be argued that the popularity of the Narnia books has overshadowed the rest of Baynes's astonishingly large body of work. She prided herself on her meticulous research and had a huge and eclectic working library from which she drew her inspiration.</p> <p>In 1957 she illustrated Amabel Williams-Ellis's edition of The Arabian Nights, and five years later came Tolkien's The Adventures of Tom Bombadil. Iona and Peter Opie's Puffin Book of Nursery Rhymes was published in 1963. In 1964 there was Tree and Leaf by Tolkien and in 1966 she worked with the creator of Little Grey Rabbit, Alison Uttley, on Recipes from an Old Farmhouse. Tolkien's Smith of Wootton Major followed in 1967. In 1968 she won the Kate Greenaway Medal for her illustrations to Grant Uden's A Dictionary of Chivalry. She almost managed to duplicate this achievement when she was runner up for her artwork for Helen Piers's Spider and Snail (1972).</p> <p>Her other books included Rosemary Harris's The Enchanted Horse (1981), The Story of Daniel by George MacBeth (1986) and The Moses Basket (2003) by Jenny Koralek. She wrote books as well as illustrating them. These included Victoria and the Golden Bird (1948), How Dog Began (1985), Good King Wenceslas (1987) and The Elephant's Ball (2007). It was partly because of a scarcity of commissions, latterly some measure of independent financial security and an inability to cease creating - she would refer to this as her \"obsession\" - that she produced works from her own rich imagination. There was a return to Tolkien in 1990 (Bilbo's Last Song) and Lewis with Peter Dickinson's A Book of Narnians (1994).</p> <p>It was somewhat to her chagrin that she developed a reputation over the years as an illustrator of mostly Christian works and, to redress the balance, one of her last creations (her \"children\" as she called them) was a series of designs for selections from the Qur'an, scheduled for publication in 2009. A project for some 40 illustrations for Aesop's fables remains unfinished at her death.</p> <p>Dogs were a great passion in her life as well as music, mostly Handel, which she would have playing in the background while working. In 1961 she married a German ex-prisoner of war, Fritz Otto Gasch. They set up home in a small village just outside Farnham, and Fritz died in 1988.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Pauline Baynes, illustrator, born September 9 1922; died August 1 2008</p>",
  "<p>The two assailants behind China's deadliest militant assault in a decade were Islamic jihadists intent on turning 2008 into \"a year of mourning\" for the Olympic host, the authorities claimed today.</p> <p>Describing yesterday's killing of 16 police in Kashgar as part of a well-plotted and long-planned attack, the local communist party chief Shi Dagang vowed to fight back against separatist forces who he accused of plotting \"monthly major events\" until the end of the Olympics.</p> <p>He said two local men from the Uighur ethnic group - named as Kebanyan Ahmet and Abdul Rahman - had confessed to carjacking a truck, then running it at high speed into a group of paramilitary police out jogging. They then lobbed homemade bombs at the survivors and finished off others with knives. In addition to the deaths, 16 police were injured. Two remain in a critical condition. </p> <p>One suspect lost an arm in an explosion. Police said they later found nine unused bombs, two knives, two daggers, a gun and a letter among the possessions of the assailants. In the letter, the attackers - one a vegetable seller, the other a taxi driver - reportedly stated that religious beliefs were more important than their own lives or their wives or their mothers so they would devote themselves to jihad.</p> <p>No evidence was presented to directly link the two men to separatist Uighur groups who want to create an \"East Turkestan\" homeland in Xinjiang, the westernmost region of China bordering Pakistan, Afghanistan and several other central Asian nations. Foreign civil rights groups and overseass Uighur organisations said it was far from certain that the killings marked an escalation from the sporadic, small-scale and unsophisticated attacks that have plagued the region for more than 20 years.</p> <p>But Shi said the attack came at a time when East Turkestan groups at home and abroad were using the internet to plot attacks on the Beijing Games and spread information about bomb-making and chemical warfare. \"Their aim is to use simple means to attack the Chinese government and to turn 2008 into a year of mourning,\" he said, naming three organisations: the East Turkestan Islamic Movement, the East Turkestan Liberation Organisation and the East Turkestan Independent Movement.</p> <p>Amid concerns that more attacks may come before the Games, police set up checkpoints around the Silk Road city, 3,000 miles west of Beijing, while riot police ringed the hospital where the injured officers were being treated.</p> <p>Several locals said they faced extra identity-card checks and door-to-door inspections. The colourful main bazaar was closed early and traders were forbidden from praying at their workplace. Stallholders said they were scared to talk about the incident or their feelings towards Chinese rule. \"It is dangerous to discuss such things,\" said a spice seller. \"One wrong word and you can end up in prison.\" </p> <p>Among a dozen or so people approached by the Guardian, more than half said their lives have improved in the past five years thanks to China's economic growth, but others expressed frustration at controls on Islam. \"There is no religious freedom,\" said a student. \"I can only wear a long dress and headscarf at home because it is forbidden at my university.\" Teachers in public schools are dismissed if they grow beards, seen as a sign of religious belief.</p> <p>At the Idkah Mosque in the main square, the authorities have posted up a sign warning worshippers that they are committing a crime if they visit Mecca as individuals, rather than going on a tour organised by the state-affiliated religious organisations. \"Organised and planned prayer is national policy,\" begins the document. \"Muslim citizens should not believe the lies of those who want to organise illegal trips.\" Since the start of this year, the authorities say they have arrested 18 criminals who were trained overseas.</p> <p>Some Uighurs fear cultural assimilation and the plunder of their oil and minerals resources by the Han ethnic group, which makes up the vast majority elsewhere in China. Since the communist party took power in 1949, Han settlers and their families have gone from being less than a tenth of the Xinjiang population to more than half. \"Even small children tell me Xinjiang belongs to the Uighurs so I should go back to China,\" says one Han taxi driver, who was born in Kashgar. </p> <p>Dilxat Raxit, spokesman for the exiled World Uighur Congress, said the government had rounded up many Uighurs in Kashgar following the attack. His claim could not be confirmed. But the authorities were heavy handed in dealing with some foreign journalists. Police forcibly removed two Japanese reporters from a street, beat them and damaged their equipment.</p>",
  "<p>Rotherham and Bournemouth may be little more than 48 hours from oblivion, with the Football League threatening to block the clubs' participation in League Two over the timetable of takeovers.</p> <p>The league has yet to be persuaded that the companies intending to buy the clubs have satisfied criteria for the transfer of the so-called \"golden\" share that enables them to play in the league. In both cases it remains with the old football-club companies, which are in administration. </p> <p>Although the league is prepared to admit them as \"old co\" clubs, it has demanded guarantees that they will be able to complete the season. There has been a flurry of correspondence between the clubs and the league but neither administrator has yet been able to convince the league board that there is funding to see his club through to May. The league is also calling for the administrators to demonstrate that they have a clear exit route from receivership.</p> <p>After receiving more interim funding in the shape of a six-figure cheque last weekend Bournemouth's administrator, Gerald Krasner, said yesterday: \"It's business as usual.\" But both he and Rotherham's administrator, Jeremy Bleazard, must convince an emergency board meeting of the league this week.</p> <p>Rotherham's problems have been exacerbated by the league's demand for a \u00a3750,000 bond for them to be permitted to play at the Don Valley Stadium after quitting Millmoor last month. Bleazard did not return calls last night.</p> <p></p> <h2><strong>Standing their ground</strong></h2> <p>The three stakeholder boards in the Champions Twenty20 League were again warned yesterday of the legal threat posed by ESPN Star's reaction to the scheduling of the tournament. For the second time in seven days a senior executive from the International Cricket Council has written to the Board of Control for Cricket in India, Cricket Australia and Cricket South Africa informing them that ESPN Star has served notice of its intention to sue. The ICC believes that if the competition - currently slated to begin 24 hours after its 50-overs Champions Trophy ends - is deferred by at least seven days it could take the heat out of the situation. But BCCI, the major shareholder in the Champions League venture, has so far shown no appetite to do so, maintaining that since the competition is made up of club teams the ICC's rules over the scheduling of international tournaments should not apply.</p> <p></p> <h2><strong>Barking up a new tree</strong></h2> <p>Manchester United's club solicitor, Maurice Watkins, has accepted the position of chairman of the Greyhound Board of Great Britain. Watkins will remain on the United board, where he has served for almost 25 years. Ian Taylor, who was the goalkeeper in Great Britain's gold-medal-winning hockey team at the Seoul Olympics in 1988, will become chief executive, charged with building on the 2.4m regular spectators that give dog racing the UK's third-highest cumulative attendances. Watkins and Taylor, formerly chief executive of sportscotland and London Irish rugby club, were delivered by the headhunter Paul Nolan for the roles.</p> <p></p> <h2><strong>Fans seeing red</strong></h2> <p>The emotions generated by supporting today's foreign-owned clubs are laid bare by the reaction of a Liverpool fans' group to arrangements by the club's own travel department. A statement on Liverpool's website announced that their official coach trip to the Champions League qualifier at Standard Li\u00e8ge next Tuesday would be laid on at \u00a365 per head. The fans' group could not even bring itself to name the club when it responded: \"Spirit Of Shankly notes that one of our competitors is now offering this trip at \u00a365, which is the price originally discussed by [SOS]. As a result of this, our price has now been reduced by \u00a35 and set at \u00a360 to ensure our members are getting the best deal available.\"</p> <p></p> <h2><strong>Big eyes on Sky</strong></h2> <p>Sky Sports presenters and producers will have to be on their toes over the coming weeks as the broadcaster's managing director, Vic Wakeling, convalesces at home after an operation. Wakeling informed staff yesterday of his forthcoming surgery and that he intends to spend all his spare time - of which there will be plenty during his prescribed bed rest - watching television.</p>",

According to research published today, a yawn is likely to set off pets as well as those around you. Psychologists found that dogs were far more likely to break into a yawn if they witnessed humans simulating the action.</p> <p>The finding is the first evidence to suggest animals other than primates may be susceptible to catching yawns from others. Atsushi Senju, who led the study at Birkbeck, University of London, said dogs' ability to catch yawns suggests they may be better at empathising with humans than previously thought. </p> <p>Yawns improve blood flow in the brain and boost alertness, but why they should be contagious is less well understood. Some scientists argue that the ability to catch yawns arose in early humans because it helped to keep tiring groups alert, or signalled when it was time to rest. </p> <p>A previous study by Senju found that people with autism do not find yawning contagious, while other researchers have shown that those who do tend to score more highly in social awareness tests.</p> <p>In the latest research, Senju's team recruited 29 pet owners and their dogs - labradors, border collies, yorkshire terriers and dobermans. </p> <p>Each dog sat through two tests. In the first, scientists simulated a loud, vocal yawn every time the dog made eye contact. In the control tests, scientists opened their mouths, without making a noise. </p> <p>\"We found that when the experimenters mimicked yawning, 21 out of 29 dogs showed contagious yawning, so this is a very strong and reliable effect,\" said Senju, whose study appears in the journal Biology Letters. </p> <p>\"None of the dogs in the control group yawned. We know contagious yawning is linked to empathy, so it may mean dogs can empathise well with humans, but we need to do more tests to be sure,\" he said. </p> <p>While it is possible the dogs were simply copying the yawning movement, Senju said it was unlikely because dogs usually need to be trained to copy human actions. \"Copying would actually be more difficult than yawning,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>Freddie Mac, the mortgage firm that had to be rescued by the US government last month, was warned as early as 2004 that dubious loans were compromising its financial health.</p> <p>Freddie's former chief risk officer, David Andrukonis, told the New York Times that he sent chief executive Richard Syron a memo in mid-2004 showing that Freddie's underwriting standards were slipping and potential liabilities were widening. He says he warned Syron at a meeting that the number of bad loans \"would likely pose an enormous financial and reputational risk to the company and the country\".

A crisis of confidence erupted last month when it became clear that they faced losses far higher than initially feared in the meltdown in US sub-prime home loans.

The nonpartisan congressional budget office estimated this could require $25bn of taxpayers' money.</p> <p>Syron, 64, is due to stand down as chief executive once a successor can be found.

  "<p>For five years, no one would say for certain whether Aafia Siddiqui, a mother of three with a PhD from an elite American university, was alive or dead. Her family did not know and authorities in Pakistan and the US were not saying.</p> <p>Yesterday, as Siddiqui was produced before a magistrate in New York to face charges of attacking US army officers in Afghanistan last month, that central mystery was resolved.</p> <p>The devout Pakistani-American Muslim, once named by the US as a top al-Qaida operative, is indeed alive and now in US custody. But almost nothing can be said for certain about her whereabouts since March 2003, when she was last seen getting into a taxi with her three children in Pakistan's biggest city, Karachi.</p> <p>Some campaigners believe Siddiqui was snatched by Pakistani intelligence agents, passed to the Americans, and held in solitary confinement at the US base in Bagram, Afghanistan. There she acquired mythical status - prisoner 650 - whose wails haunted other inmates.</p> <p>But the US, which has made multiple allegations against Siddiqui over the years depicting her as a courier of blood diamonds and a financial fixer for al-Qaida, has denied holding her, raising the question: where has she been for five years?</p> <p>Siddiqui's emergence three weeks ago in Afghanistan is riddled with confusion. The official complaint against Siddiqui says she was picked up outside the governor's compound in the eastern Afghan city of Ghazni on July 17 by police who became suspicious of her inability to speak either of Afghanistan's main languages, Pashtu or Darri. They searched her handbag, discovering documents detailing how to make dirty bombs and biological weapons and descriptions of New York landmarks, as well as sealed glass jars of \"numerous chemical substances\". </p> <p>A day later, the complaint says, two US army officers and two FBI agents arrived in Ghazni with their interpreters for a meeting - not realising that Siddiqui was standing behind a yellow curtain in the same room.</p> <p>Siddiqui is then alleged to have jumped out from behind the curtain and snatched up the assault rifle one of the officers had placed on the floor by his feet, pointing it at the Americans, and screaming threats in English. She is said to have fired at least two shots by the time an interpreter managed to wrestle the gun away from her. </p> <p>According to the complaint, one officer heard her yell \"Allahu Akbar\" as she opened fire. One interpreter claimed she shouted: \"Get the fuck out of here.\"</p> <p>She was shot and hit at least once in the torso but, according to the complaint, continued to hit and kick the officers before losing consciousness.</p> <p>Siddiqui's lawyer, Elaine Whitfield Sharp, told CNN the scenario was utterly implausible. \"This is a very intelligent woman. What is she doing outside of the governor's residence?\" Sharp said.</p> <p>\"The woman is a PhD. Is a woman like this really that stupid? There is an incongruity, and I have trouble accepting the government's claims.\"</p> <p>Yesterday, Afghan police in Ghazni offered another competing version of her detention, telling Reuters that the US troops had demanded she be handed over. When Afghan police refused, they were disarmed. The Americans shot at Siddiqui, thinking she was a suicide bomber. A teenage boy who was with Siddiqui remained in Afghan police custody.</p> <p>Before yesterday's court appearance in New York, Siddiqui was last seen heading for Karachi's railway station, where, along with her three children, then aged seven, five and six months old, she planned to catch a train to visit an uncle in Islamabad.</p> <p>Her life before that was exemplary. She had studied in America, earning a degree from MIT before moving on to a PhD in cognitive neuroscience from Brandeis University. She was unhappily married, to a Pakistani.</p> <p>Acquaintances over her years in Boston have described her commitment to Islam. She returned to Pakistan in 2002, where her marriage broke up and she was living with her family at the time of her disappearance. Siddiqui's relatives believe that she was abducted by Pakistani intelligence agents and later transferred to US custody. She first appeared on the radar of US intelligence services in 2001 because of a series of donations to a now-banned Islamist charity that also had Saudi connections. But she became of greater interest after the capture of the alleged 9/11 mastermind, Khalid Sheikh Muhammed, in March 2003, who named her under interrogation. The US argues that Muhammed would not have mentioned her unless she was connected to al-Qaida.</p> <p>The BBC yesterday reported on its website that Siddiqui had married a nephew of Muhammed's called Ali Abd'al Aziz Ali following her divorce. Siddiqui's family denies the connection, but the BBC said it had confirmation from security sources and Muhammed's family.</p> <p>US and Pakistani officials initially admitted that she was indeed in detention, and some reports said she was being held by the Americans outside Kabul.</p> <p>But by 2004 John Ashcroft, then US attorney general, said she was among seven high-level al-Qaida suspects still at large.</p> <p>In the meantime, concern for her grew after accounts emerged from prisoners at Bagram of a solitary woman inmate. Anger at her disappearance was further stoked last month when Yvonne Ridley, a British Muslim journalist, flew to Pakistan and held a press conference claiming that Siddiqui was Prisoner 650 at Bagram. </p> <p>Imran Khan, the cricketer turned politician, hosted the event, where Ridley, who also now does human rights work, said: \"I call her the 'grey lady' because she is almost a ghost, a spectre whose cries and screams continue to haunt those who heard her.\"</p> <p>A group of Arab prisoners who escaped from Bagram in 2005 said they saw a woman being taken to the toilets at the base. After breaking out, Abu Yahya al-Libi told an Arabic news channel that there was a woman from Pakistan at Bagram who was referred to simply as prisoner 650, held in solitary confinement.</p> <p>The American account of her capture was dismissed yesterday. \"This is one of the greatest lies of the 21st century ... \" said IA Rehman, director general of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), an independent organisation.</p> <p>Siddiqui's sister, Fauzia, said she had been raped and tortured. \"Her rape and torture is a crime beyond anything she was accused of,\" she said. \"This is the real crime of terror here.\" She pleaded for the child who was with her sister when she was captured, according to the American authorities, to be immediately handed over to the family. It is unclear what has happened to the other two children.</p> <p>\"She has had no access to any lawyer ... presume her to be innocent before proven guilty, please. How can this punishment be fit for any crime?\" said Fauzia Siddiqui.</p> <p>Asim Qureshi, a London-based investigator for Cage Prisoners, a campaign group, said the US had in the past denied holding other prisoners, such as Mustafa Setmariam Nasar, a Spaniard of Syrian descent also captured in Pakistan.</p> <p>\"They just release the information when it suits them ... everything we know about Bagram means that we know she [Siddiqui] would have suffered abuse.\"</p>",
  "<p>Japanese electronics group Sony is buying its partner Bertelsmann out of their Sony BMG music joint venture, in a deal worth $1.2bn (\u00a3614m) to the German media group.</p> <p>The move could provide privately-held Bertelsmann, whose RTL unit owns British television channel Five, with the financial firepower to buy all or part of BSkyB's controversial 17.9% stake in ITV.</p> <p>The sale, which needs regulatory approval, is part of Bertelsmann boss Hartmut Ostrowski's plan to dispose of under-performing or non-core businesses. </p> <p>Last year, online piracy helped push music sales to their lowest level for a decade, down 8% globally to $19.4bn, according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry. </p> <p>Sony BMG's sales dropped 4%, to $4.1bn, last year as digital revenues failed to make up for declining sales of CDs.

  "<p>Men's battered honour has been documented all over the place these past few days. Kathleen Parker led the field with her book Save the Males: Why Men Matter, Why Women Should Care. \"Men have been under siege by a culture that too often embraces the notion that men are to blame for all life's ills,\" avers Parkers in a text that had the Sunday papers transfixed. Yesterday in the Mail, Richard Littlejohn took Michael Vaughan, the former England cricket captain, as both a symptom of and a contributor to our weak-minded, feminised society, which attacks masculinity at every turn, reinforcing failure with cooing sympathy, drugging macho life force with Ritalin. Poor cricketer. All he did was shed a tear for his lost career, and he singlehandedly undid our last few threads of cultural resilience. But there I go again with my cooing sympathy. </p> <p>While Vaughan was drying his eyes, Michael Gove, shadow secretary of state for children, was making a rather rangy speech to the Institute of Public Policy Research in which he blamed lads' mags for encouraging young men to have sex hedonistically - ergo failing to understand that women weren't a pleasure, they were a duty, ergo creating single- parent family units. It all seemed a bit Jesuitical to me. The missing link that stops an enjoyable act of sexual congress becoming a one-parent family is a contraceptive device, not a respectable magazine culture, surely? </p> <p>You can pick holes in these arguments all you like, and I will just take a second out, and do so. If men work an average 41.9 hours a week and women, 37.6 hours, this is not, as the American \"masculinist\" and \"men's rights author\" Warren Farrell told the Observer, a sign that women have more power over their lives. It is simply a reflection that they do more of the childcare. </p> <p>Mothers spend 12% more time than fathers looking after children, and women generally spend 78% more time on housework than men. I am personally in favour of lower standards of hygiene to solve this battle of the gender war, but that's a minority view. Still it's not, I hope, as extreme a conclusion as Farrell's: \"I define power as 'control over one's life'. A balanced life is far superior to the male definition of power: earning money someone else spends while he dies sooner.\" If, as a mother, you are described as \"spending someone else's money\" just by bringing up your mutually begat children, that doesn't seem to me like a powerful position at all. </p> <p>Here's the problem - when you get into a battle of the sexes, both sides have grievances. Society tends to denigrate men more openly than it does women, but then women are portrayed so routinely as hunks of flesh to be measured out by the pound that we only notice it happening to men because it's aberrant. Ultimately, you can carry on about culture, and what it does to self-esteem, how people see fathers, how they see mothers, how parents see themselves and one another; you can argue about this stuff forever. </p> <p>You might say boys were discriminated against by the GCSE system. I would return, who's to say they didn't just work less hard? You might say that culture was fuelling male neurosis, to the degree that 25% of eating disorders now occur among men; I would reply that 75% are still women. I'm as guilty of this retort reflex as anyone. Derisive portrayals of women by mainstream culture enrage me. Arguments like those of Farrell make me furious. It's like a messy divorce in macrocosm: you lose any sense of justice in the proliferation of small outrages.</p> <p>The only reason feminism gained any ground at all is that there was measurable injustice at the heart of it. There was a pay gap; there was an opportunities gap; there was a straightforward power void, where a woman was fine if she stayed the right side of her husband. The big mistake of this movement was not that it attacked men, nor that it turned us all into slags (I think that's at the core of Gove's point), but that it separated itself from socialism. It shouldn't have. This movement either fights for fairness on behalf of all women, or it's just a petty squabble between middle-class people, fighting for dominance in a conversation no one else is listening to.</p> <p>Fairness has not yet been established. Women still earn less than men (14% less full-time, 34% less part-time), still look after the children in 93% of parental separations, won't have fiscal equality in old age from the pension system for about 45 years. Men are ill-served by the NHS and die of unnecessary cancers, while women are screened much more often. Let's attack this stuff that we can measure, attack it even if we're not the victims of it, attack it even if it's conflicting, here favouring men, there favouring women, attack it because its tangibility is an open flank. The rest is just noise. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:mszoewilliams@yahoo.co.uk\">mszoewilliams@yahoo.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>In November 1995, Private Cheryl James became the second of four soldiers to die of gunshot wounds at the MoD's now infamous Deepcut training barracks in Surrey. She was reportedly found in woodland with her rifle by her side, a single gunshot wound in her forehead. James, who was just 18 years old, had been in the army for six months.</p> <p>More than a decade on - after two police investigations, one police review, one defence select committee investigation and one governmental review - her parents, Doreen and Des, are no closer to knowing exactly what happened to their daughter. \"I used to refer to people who carry the opinions I carry today as cynics and conspiracy theorists,\" says Des, seated next to his wife at Sherman Cymru theatre in Cardiff. \"The experience has made me extremely cynical of the police force, the government, the MoD and the establishment.\" </p> <p>What is most striking about this genial pair - Doreen is a former nurse, Des a human resources director - is not their tears or their anger, but their simple desire to know the truth. Playwright Philip Ralph is on a similar quest, and he is currently telling their story in Deep Cut, a verbatim drama playing at Edinburgh's Traverse theatre. The work is a compendium of first-hand interviews, public statements and source material from soldiers, lawyers, journalists, forensic experts and bereaved parents.</p> <p>Ralph, who took three years to distil all this into a play, was originally commissioned by the Sherman Cymru to write about the army. He soon found the story of James, born in Llangollen, north Wales, and decided it should be a piece of documentary theatre. \"I let the story people wanted to tell me lead me to the play,\" he says. \"I never asked a leading question and was careful to get people to tell me what they wanted to tell me. It's an important story. It goes into every area of the state: the government, the judiciary, the police, the army and the MoD.\"</p> <p>The Deepcut deaths raise troubling questions as to whether these four soldiers took their own lives, as the official version has it, or whether they were murdered. \"If it was suicide, what made these four children do it?\" says Doreen. \"There must have been something going on to make four apparently happy and healthy people do that.\"</p> <p>The first death was that of Sean Benton from Hastings, who apparently fired five bullets into his own chest in 1995. James died less than five months later, weeks after her 18th birthday. Then, in 2001, came the death of Geoff Gray from Durham, with two shots fired into his forehead, at an angle unusual for suicide. The following year James Collinson, from Perth, died of a single shot through his chin. Although Des and Doreen initially accepted the army's version of events, they became increasingly perplexed. The coroner recorded an open verdict on James's death, but an army board of inquiry later decided it was suicide.</p> <p>Media attention, including a BBC Frontline Scotland investigation, put pressure on the Surrey police to reopen its investigation which, in turn, was reviewed by the Devon and Cornwall constabulary. Finally came a review of all the official investigations by Nicholas Blake QC, who in 2006 concluded there was no need for a public inquiry, saying that \"on the balance of probabilities\" the deaths were self-inflicted. In Deep Cut, Ralph refuses to jump to any conclusions. \"I do have opinions,\" he says, \"but I wouldn't dream of telling you what they are. I've looked at all the available evidence in the way that Nicholas Blake did in his review. My ideas hold no more water than his. In my opinion, unless you were standing there when it happened, you don't know.\"</p> <p>Deep Cut is not the only play to have been written about the barracks. In October, a dramatisation of the story of Geoff Gray - called Geoff Dead: Disco for Sale - will open at Newcastle's Live theatre. \"The play is focusing on the parents' quest for justice, rather than speculating on what happened,\" says writer Fiona Evans. \"They know their own children. They were such happy-go-lucky boys and suicide wasn't in keeping with the way their lives were going. They are adamant their children didn't commit suicide - so it follows that someone else killed them.\"</p> <p>Des and Doreen are holding out for a public inquiry, but the lack of publicly available evidence means they can only speculate. Des believes the barracks were out of control. \"Anarchy on the campus prevailed,\" he says, pointing to evidence of bullying. \"It was subdued after the first two deaths, but it rose again in 2001 and 2002, when you have a similar situation: mysterious deaths and, more to the point, no investigation. That shows the culture in the camp is at the core of this.\"</p> <p>For Ralph, the power of his play lies in its lack of an ending - the audience is left to wrestle with many unresolved questions. That's fine for an audience, but do the parents have any hope of closure? \"Absolutely,\" says Des. \"It is an appalling wrong, in a civilised society, that four kids can die and we can allow our government to dance around justice in the way that they have. I don't think it's something I can walk away from.\"</p>",
  "<p>On the day I go to rehearsals for 365, the big new show from the National Theatre of Scotland - the successor to 2006's hit Black Watch, and last year's spectacular The Bacchae - nobody has the faintest idea how the play is going to end: not the actors, not the director, not even the playwright. The production opens in just two weeks.</p> <p>\"We have decided to kill off a character,\" says director Vicky Featherstone, who is also artistic director of the NTS, perhaps a touch enthusiastically. Two young women, watched over by Featherstone and movement director Steven Hoggett (who also worked on Black Watch and The Bacchae), enact a poised, strange, almost ritualistic kind of dance. There are words, but 16-year-old actor Marlene Madenge is improvising. \"Don't worry, we'll write proper words for you - lines,\" Featherstone reassures her, before giving the cheery instruction: \"You can die now!\"</p> <p>The serious-looking, shaven-headed man in the corner of the room, with light lashes and pale-green eyes, is David Harrower, the man who is going to have to come up with the lines. The writer - who won an Olivier award for Blackbird, his razor-sharp play about a woman who tracks down the man she had a relationship with when she was 12 - is, it is safe to say, deep in terra incognita. While there is nothing new in plays being devised through workshops, it is unusual for a writer like Harrower to put himself in the position of writing a drama as it emerges from the disparate imaginations of a group of people in rehearsal. \"Usually, I'd be at home shaping this thing with the variety of tools that I use; and bringing it in and expecting people to go, 'Wow, this is amazing, it's Harrower's usual sculpted prose,'\" he says. \"OK, I'm just joking. But I'm being less of an author in this than anything I've ever done. I build the fucking scaffold at home myself, usually. I have a sense of where the story is going, I know where it's going to end, I have the whole shape of it in my head. But with this, I haven't even read the play through yet.\" Frankly, I can see the fear in his eyes.</p> <p>So why is he putting himself through nine kinds of torture? What is this play all about? Crudely put, 365 tells the stories of 15 young people as they emerge from care homes. The idea came when Featherstone read Nick Davies' book on child poverty, Dark Heart: The Shocking Truth About Hidden Britain. \"It was one of those books that opened up a new way of thinking about the world to me,\" she says. \"It exposed the hypocrisy of how we think of ourselves in Britain as a civilised society - and yet we are surrounded by children in the most terrible circumstances.\" The ideas in the book kept resonating, but she couldn't think of a way to dramatise them until she talked to a trustee of Barnardo's, who told her about the \"practice flats\" that young people encounter when they leave care. There are many different kinds of flats, but at best they are a safe environment where young people can learn to live unsupervised and prepare for the adult world: to budget, to cook, to shop, to clean.</p> <p>As soon as Featherstone struck on the notion of the practice flat, she knew she had found the device that could turn her hazy idea into a piece of theatre: it was the place where these children transformed themselves, a threshold between one world and another. \"It zoomed into my head,\" she says. She asked Harrower to write the play, but there was no question of waiting for him to come up with a text over a period of months or years. Besides, he was keen \"to try a different way of working, I wanted to test myself\". According to Featherstone: \"I knew if we were going to make a piece of theatre we had to do it now; it felt urgent. Black Watch communicated something that people needed to know about at the time, and this felt similar. I wanted us to move quickly.\"</p> <p>Featherstone and Harrower researched their material, talking to young people who had been in care, social workers, psychotherapists and others. Featherstone knew she wanted a broad sweep, a cast of 15 or so. By the beginning of the rehearsal period, Harrower had written, he says, 27 \"proud pages\" - and they have nearly all been scrapped. \"They were banal and simplistic,\" he says. \"I don't begin plays this way. Usually I have a daft wee idea that grows this little carbuncle on it. Then that grows another bigger one on it, and that becomes a play. It doesn't start with, 'Ninety-five per cent of children in care have mental health issues.' I don't start with statistics, ever. I start with an idea like a man rubbing the inside of his thigh and someone seeing it, do you know what I mean? The writing that came out of my addressing statistics was shit.\"</p> <p>He had another problem. \"I was worried there weren't enough stories in a flat, with the poverty of imagination I have,\" he says. \"My first thought was, do they want a lot of Scots kids sitting around taking drugs? Because that's not the stuff that I write.\" But the subject matter suggested a more allusive, less documentary approach. \"We did more and more research, and realised the flat means the end of care and the end of state parenting, and it also means the beginning of adult life,\" he says. \"It also means a place where these people can die; a place where things can fuck up. So it became this very complex metaphorical place where you find out how well you are prepared for the world, about your identity.\"</p> <p>The flat the audience will see as a stage set represents a number of different flats scattered across Glasgow. The stories of the characters do not reflect directly what Harrower and Featherstone gleaned from interviews, though Harrower says: \"The thing about this world is, once you get into it, it's a place with so many ghosts.\" He heard memories of people with forgotten names, stories that seemed to have migrated into urban myth through their retelling, and anecdotes that didn't resolve because no one ever knew how the kid ended up. </p> <p>The narratives are fragmented and layered, a torn-up storytelling style that reflects the often confused inner lives of the young people the play portrays. \"In a sense,\" says Harrower, \"we are dealing with people who have very little sense of where they have come from and where they are going. You come back to core psychological things. Low self-esteem, anger, mental-health issues. These are people who are not in control of their own narratives. Every time you want to complete the circle you can't. Time and again, with everyone I've talked to, there is a sense of unfinishedness about these people, incompleteness.\" Harrower talks about how children in care often grow up without a sense of their own identity or story - children for whom there is no family photo album, no shared jokes, no clan traditions, no one to tell you what your first words were or what you were like as a baby. \"For these people,\" says Featherstone, \"there can often be no such thing as a reliable narrator.\" The search for a personal narrative became an analogy, for Featherstone, of the act of seeing a piece of theatre, \"where we try to latch hold of a narrative and grasp at a truth\". </p> <p>Harrower has had to learn that storytelling is not always best done through words, and that it can be done through gesture, movement. \"When I see people fannying around on the floor, I think, that's going in my story, the story that I started? Fuck off! But as it gets tighter and tighter, I realise this is what I always wanted this piece to be: a collective response to something.\" He is also having to withstand the experience of being a writer in the front line. \"[The cast] have got to learn that, for the greater good of the piece, some people are not going to get as much as other people. I write a monologue for somebody, and everyone wants a monologue. It's like you're coming into a war-torn country with a lorry full of rice, and every day people gather round the back of the lorry and you unload your scripts, and they get what they get. And there's always about four or five who don't get anything, and they sort of retreat to the corner of the room.\"</p> <p>Harrower - almost certainly his own harshest critic - says: \"Everything I have written up to now is two people arguing about why one of them left the other. It feels very earthbound. I don't think I have ever used a metaphor well.\" Despite the self-effacement, he remains passionately addicted to theatre as a form. \"I've been pissing around doing film and TV for the past year, and I think, 'Why am I wasting my time with that shit?' I could stage the Peloponnesian war between two people in a caravan.\" I have no doubt that he could: for now, though, all eyes will be on the allusive, rich piece of storytelling that 365 promises to be.</p>",
  "<p>Two major European carriers, Air France-KLM and Iberia, reported a slump in profits yesterday as the airline industry continues to suffer from high fuel costs. </p> <p>British Airways, which posted an 88% fall in profits last week, also confirmed that the economic downturn is hitting demand as higher fares depressed economy-class sales. </p> <p>Air France-KLM, the world's largest airline by revenues, said first-quarter profits fell by 59% to \u20ac168m (\u00a3133m) and Iberia, which last week confirmed merger talks with BA, swung to an operating loss of \u20ac3.9m. Air France-KLM is seeking a further \u20ac180m in cost savings \"in response to the economic environment\", the airline said, with its annual fuel bill expected to rise by nearly one-third to \u20ac5.86bn. Both airlines blamed the poor results on high fuel costs.</p> <p>BA warned last week that the industry faced its \"worst ever\" trading environment after first-quarter profits were nearly wiped out by the cost of keeping its planes in the air. The airline indicated yesterday that passenger numbers are being affected by fare increases implemented over the past two months to cover the rising cost of oil. </p> <p>Traffic fell 3.5% overall as BA flew 94,000 fewer passengers in July, with passenger numbers in economy-class cabins declining by 4.1% as the carrier admitted that cheaper tickets were \"most sensitive to price changes\". BA's performance in the all-important UK-to-US market deteriorated with the number of seats sold falling from 81% to 75%.</p> <p>Iberia confirmed that it is close to requesting clearance from US competition authorities for an alliance with BA and American Airlines. The partnership will allow the three airlines to cooperate over fares and schedules, creating a powerful grouping with a strong position in the transatlantic market. Fernando Conte, Iberia's chairman, said he was \"positive\" about the expected reaction of the US government to the bid for anti-trust (competition law) clearance.</p> <p>Air France-KLM's deputy chief executive, Pierre-Henri Gourgeon, welcomed the move. \"In this business there are too many players and when things turn bad it becomes a suicidal race,\" he said. \"BA, Iberia link up, that means one less player.\"</p> <p>Ryanair, Europe's largest budget airline, provided some better news for the sector by reporting strong July traffic figures. Its passenger load factor, which states the number of seats sold per flight, dipped from 90% to 89% and was in line with analysts' expectations. Nonetheless, the airline expects to make a loss this financial year if the oil price stays at high levels. However, the pressure on airlines has eased slightly this week as the cost of oil fell below $120 (\u00a361) a barrel.</p> <p>Ryanair's fraught relationship with BAA reached a new low yesterday after it emerged that the airport owner is suing the Dublin-based carrier over non-payment of landing fees.</p> <p>Britain's largest airport operator is taking legal action to recover millions of pounds' worth of payments that have been withheld since April. Ryanair's chief executive, Michael O'Leary, is refusing to pay in full fees that have climbed from \u00a35.50 a passenger to \u00a35.88 since the spring.</p> <p>It is understood that BAA has been attempting to recover the charges for some time.

Members of the US athletics team arrived in the city wearing face masks yesterday and organisers are preparing to postpone or relocate endurance events including the marathon and road cycling if smog levels reach dangerous limits. </p> <p>But yesterday Arne Ljungqvist, chairman of the IOC's medical commission, said he was confident that pollution would not harm athletes or visitors, and suggested media coverage had created a false impression of pollution levels. </p> <p>\"The mist in the air that we see in those places, including here, is not a feature of pollution primarily but a feature of evaporation and humidity,\" he told the IOC's annual session. \"We do have a communication problem here. Once the misconception has become sort of established in the minds of people, it's not that easy to get the right message through. </p> <p>\"I would not discourage athletes from wearing protection devices if they are concerned, but I do not think it is necessary. I would not wear one whether I was an athlete or not.\" Two days of haze gave way to sunshine yesterday afternoon, but the official measure of air quality remained close to dangerous levels.</p> <p>Official readings collated by Beijing's municipal environmental protection bureau yesterday gave an air pollution index (API) of 91 for Beijing as a whole, and 87 at the Olympic stadium. The World Health Organisation regards an API of more than 50 as high, and a reading of 100 or more is considered unsafe. The authorities monitor air quality hourly, including levels of particulates, carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide, and take limited readings for ozone. </p> <p>Ljungqvist said the readings were in line with the WHO's interim targets for developing countries, and that the pollution did not pose a threat to the health of athletes visiting for the Olympics. </p> <p>He met with the WHO's local representative three days ago, and characterised his concerns as being primarily with the \"exaggeration of the problem that has been seen in the media\".</p> <p>\"Those [WHO] standards are fairly tough to meet, but in many respects the Beijing area does so. I'm sure, I'm confident the air quality will not prove to pose major problems to the athletes and to the visitors in Beijing,\" he said. </p> <p>\"We have had some readings that were above the interim target data, but since then they have gone down and been below that level. We will evaluate those [pollution levels] and, should problems arise, we may have to take some action.\" </p> <p>Ljungqvist said the WHO's standards were relevant only to the long-term health of local residents rather than Olympic athletes and visitors. \"To come to a city even though the air quality [might be] inferior, the long-term effects should no longer be feared by temporary visitors,\" he said. </p> <p>Beijing authorities have taken measures to control pollution including banning half of the city's 3.3m cars from the roads on any given day.</p>",
  "<p>Actor Gael Garcia Bernal has been pitching for backing for a new project. No surprise there - but instead of Los Angeles moneymen, he has been talking to the British third sector. He wants it to support Resist, his documentary on individual stories of rebellion, told through a website and film project. </p> <p>\"The involvement of charities means that not only will the film inspire people to act but we can also give them a way to put this [inspiration] to use afterwards,\" says Bernal, who is co-producing the project with Thomas Benski and Pulse Films. \"We want to build a community looking at resistance.\" They are working on funding, research and distribution support with non-governmental organisations and media organisations. </p> <p>Bernal and his Resist comrades were among the eight groups of film-makers who took part in The Good Pitch, a novel part of last month's Britdoc festival in Oxford. They presented their social action documentaries to leading third sector organisations, including the Sundance Institute, Christian Aid and Amnesty International, as well as broadsheet newspapers, MySpace, and Vice magazine. </p> <p>Marc Silver, Resist director and project strategist, is hoping that the collaboration will create something remarkable. \"We want people to realise that they have the power to resist,\" he says. \"We hope that NGOs will be able to tell their members about the project, driving more people to the site. When we make the film, hopefully it will inspire more people to visit the site and join the Resist network, continuing the whole process.\"</p> <p><strong>Accelerating trend</strong></p> <p>The Good Pitch, supported by the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust (JRRT) and One World Broadcasting Trust, is driven by an accelerating UK trend. Al Gore's 2006 global-warming shock-doc, An Inconvenient Truth, seems to have woken up UK NGOs to the wonders of documentary. </p> <p>Chloe Baird-Murray, Amnesty's director of creative relationships, explains: \"In most cases, the support is not just financial. We have worked with all sorts of films, including features, such as Blood Diamond. In the past, people came to us with completed projects and asked us for support, but now we work in a more holistic way, from script development and research onwards.\"</p> <p>But what about editorial control? \"If the film-maker wants to tell both sides of the story, they can do that,\" Baird-Murray says. \"We support ... freedom of expression. Any storytelling is positive for us if it shines a light on what is happening in the world. We get involved to tell our side of the story correctly. Documentaries can be overwhelming if they do not contain a solution to the problems they highlight. NGOs can give that. Al Gore's film ended with an example of what people can do. People are ripe for that kind of activism.\"</p> <p>In the US, where public service broadcasting is weak, these sorts of arrangements have been around for decades. As a result, ongoing relationships between film-makers, the third sector and commercial brands flourish. For example, Working Films coordinated the US national community engagement campaign with the 2007 film Ghosts of Abu Ghraib. It brought together the National Religious Campaign Against Torture, the American Civil Liberties Union, faith groups and others to end what it says is the US policy sanctioning torture.</p> <p>This approach is now taking off in the UK. Amnesty and other third sector groups are discussing working with Resist, and the human rights organisation is also giving its backing to Erasing David, another documentary from The Good Pitch, which will tell the story of one man's quest for oblivion. Shocked by his daughter's identity theft, David Bond will attempt to wipe himself from all UK state, private and commercial records to show the privacy dangers of our data-guzzling society. </p> <p>As well as other backing, Amnesty can offer Bond and his co-producer, Ashley Jones, its campaigning networks, including groups Amnesty is in touch with in its work on the UK's 42-day counter-terrorism detention law. \"First we figured out what we wanted to say,\" Bond says. \"Then we went to Britdoc, and its organisers supported us pitching for funding. When people have seen what we have made, we want them to feel inspired to act.\" </p> <p>Britdoc and the JRRT are each giving the Erasing David project \u00a335,000. So what's in it for the NGOs? Mark Ross, JRRT project adviser, says: \"We got involved with Britdoc two years ago because we thought documentaries were an effective way of getting complicated issues - which can't be summed up in a soundbite - through to the public. Erasing David looks like it will be entertaining, and this makes it more accessible, which is perfect when trying to interest people in a debate.\"</p> <p>It's a perfect marriage. NGOs get access to some of the world's best film-makers, and film-makers get access to research, distribution and funding at a time when mainstream TV and film moneymen are shrinking from documentaries. </p> <p>However, not everyone is as convinced about the relationship. Vaughan Smith, an independent video journalist and founder of the Frontline Club, which champions independent journalism, is concerned that there may be difficulties when dealing with disputed topics. \"It is easy to see how these collaborations can work with subjects such as science, if there is transparency,\" he says. \"But I think that where, for example, a film-maker wants to make a documentary on the international criminal court, one needs to be particularly careful that both sides of the argument are properly analysed. </p> <p>\"I sense that film-makers often want to make a film and they are not too concerned where they come from. I am a journalist and I like to see things investigated with a critical eye. When there is more than one view on a topic, we need to be careful about where backing comes from.\"</p> <p>The Frontline Club is looking at various forms of collaboration with NGOs, but within strict editorial guidelines. \"I can't think of subjective journalism that I have a problem with, if it is marked as subjective and clear,\" Smith says. \"Most journalism is already subjective, even if it is labelled as objective. I am suspicious of all organisations, including news organisations. There always needs to be proper controls to protect editorial integrity. For NGOs, collaboration won't work if they ask for something too specific. But if, say, they want to fund increased reporting from Congo, it can work.\" </p> <p><strong>Changing media landscape</strong></p> <p>Marriages of convenience are necessary for commercial and NGO brands, as well as for film-makers and journalists, to handle the changing media landscape, according to Jess Search, Britdoc chief executive: \"There used to be five broadcasters paying high sums for documentaries. Now, with, for example, the probability that ITV will be able to reduce its public service commitments, everything is different. Commercial and third sector brands can invest in documentaries if it is done sensibly.\" </p> <p>Search argues that if a film-maker has an NGO on board, it can balance out the power of the increasingly interfering modern commissioning editor. \"Films are becoming like political elections,\" she says. \"You need people who will email friends and walk the streets to talk about a project. Third sector people care enough to do that.\"</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Daniel Lee is a journalist, author and lecturer in the film and media department of Birkbeck, University of London.</p>",
  "<p>It's not a question you get asked every day: \"How would you have felt if I'd died?\" Especially not in the middle of a meat-feast pizza. But it was put to me one Thursday night not long ago as I sat and ate with a 17-year-old boy - let's call him \"Luke\" - while he was reflecting on events some eight months earlier, when injuries he received in a car accident had left him on a life support machine. </p> <p>I had just started a new teaching job, and arrived at the intensive care unit exhausted after my first week of work. I found Luke on a respirator, with a less than 50-50 chance of survival. After all we've been through, I thought, as I sat in silent vigil with a nurse in the intensive care unit. The boy I've been meeting every week for the last three years ends up brain-damaged, crippled, or worse. Fine mentor I turned out to be.</p> <p>Mentor. The word conjures up images of Alec Guinness in his brown robe, instructing young Skywalker in the ways of \"The Force\". But the reality is more prosaic. Put simply, it's someone who offers to meet a troubled young person and to build a consistent and reliable relationship with them. Basic stuff perhaps, but, sadly, it's something a significant number of teenagers have never had. And it's the reliability a mentor displays that often has the most effect. Exhausted by a week of teaching practice, I would curse Luke's name as I waited in vain at the bus stop where he frequently failed to appear. But the point was I was there, even if he wasn't. </p> <p>I first met him in the summer of 2003, during an activity day in the countryside. From the start of the trip, he was bullied by each of the other potential mentees in turn. Someone punched him as he got off the minibus. Then his baseball cap was grabbed and chucked in a cowpat. Bullying can often look like a cruel version of pass the parcel, in which physical or verbal abuse is tossed from person to person. Those who can't return the package keep getting thrown it. And without the quick wit or physical dexterity of the other potential mentees, Luke was receiving parcels morning, noon and night. Perhaps it was empathy from my own torments at school, but I really felt for Luke. </p> <p>Our first meeting was a game of golf, played against the setting sun of an early September evening. Dragging his coat and rucksack behind him like prison irons, he explained how he'd ended up in the back of a stolen car - the reason for his referral from his secondary school (referrals can range from the police to a relative) - and how, once he'd learned to drive, the possession of a Mitsubishi or Toyota would soon be within his grasp. \"I really like cars,\" he noted mildly, an observation that, it transpired, was the understatement of the century. </p> <p>Like any relationship, there tend to be \"good\" dates and \"bad\" dates. Cinema, pizza restaurant, a game of pool ... whatever the activity, few of our meetings would go by without him showing me the latest clutch of hastily-snapped car pictures on his mobile. I became a scratch expert on mag wheel hubs, metallic paint jobs, fuel injection and aerofoils. I could just about tell apart an Impreza from an Isuzu. And I discovered the meaning of NOS - nitrous oxide systems, for the uninitiated. Basically, it makes cars go faster. A lot faster. </p> <p>But this often fantasy world of flip-top phones and flash motors was in stark contrast to the grim reality of Luke's daily life. At the end of an otherwise picturesque country lane, he lived in almost Dickensian squalor with his vague and disorientated mother. The walls were wet with damp, the cooker baked with an impressionist crusting of filth. I often found him curled up on a hard stone floor in an unwashed sleeping bag. </p> <p><strong>Lack of boundaries</strong></p> <p>On top of the dire circumstances of his home, the family was also the subject of regular attack. It's not uncommon for communities to bully a family the way a group attacks an individual, and Luke's house was often stoned or \"egged\". </p> <p>Rarely did a week go by during this period when I did not return home to find an answerphone message from the school. He had been in a fight, his phone had been stolen, he was suffering from headaches, possibly hunger-induced. Indeed, school was often the only place where Luke received any sort of nurture. </p> <p>But, in truth, they were fighting a losing battle against the teenage consequences of appalling childhood neglect. I was never to possess the full picture, but the snapshots were enough. A toddler, witnessed by neighbours, being subjected to half-an-hour of obscene verbal abuse in the garden, for example. </p> <p>It's worth asking at this point, as many people did, how he managed to slip through the child protection net. At meetings of teachers, school nurses and social workers I attended, we scratched our collective heads. My own private, and largely unprovable conclusion, was that emotional or physical neglect often came lower in the priority points system than active abuse. </p> <p>Perhaps not surprisingly, given his background, the development of his social skills was a lengthy affair. One Friday evening when we approached the bar of our regular haunt, I asked him what he'd like to drink - non-alcoholic, of course - and he promptly pulled out a half-drunk bottle of cola. \"Already got one,\" he grinned, offering me a swig. Glancing wearily at the landlady, I suggested that she might rather like to sell him a drink of her own. </p> <p>But mentoring's like that. Always two steps forward, one step back. The mumbled sound of him saying \"excuse me\" to someone he wanted to step round was a major triumph for me. Equally gratifying was his admonishment of me for not taking the empty glasses back to the bar. It showed some sort of milestone had been reached. Mentoring is not about radical change. It's about nudging someone a few degrees in a different direction. But these degrees can mean the difference between prison and a job, and that really matters. </p> <p>Those incremental gains and setbacks were how our relationship developed over the years to come. Much of it mimicked the uneasy relationship between parent and teenager. There was the teasing that often had a serious intent. \"Mind your trainers,\" I'd say, as he unleashed yet another gobbet of sputum on to the pavement. My refusal to buy him cigarettes, though, when he was, and clearly looked, underage, was a line in the sand. Perhaps inevitably, he managed to get them from somewhere. </p> <p>More serious were the mini debates we used to have when he had been temporarily excluded from school. My tactic was to gently point out the disparity between his long-term aims - getting a job and, more importantly, a driving licence and car - and the futility of his short-term actions. I also tried to paint a picture outside the consequence-free world in which teenagers are often unwittingly placed. \"A fight in a pub is very different to a fight in a classroom,\" I told him once. Sadly, the incredulous look in his eyes suggested he didn't really believe me. </p> <p>On such occasions, a question nagged at me that I found difficult to answer: \"Why am I doing this?\" Certainly, there were enough pats on the back from school and social work representatives to reassure me that I was doing \"the right thing\". But surely there was more to it than that. </p> <p>Yes, there was the quiet satisfaction of building a productive relationship with someone so frequently written off. The moments of humour, the jokes only we could share. His glee as I submitted myself to the electrocution machine on the pier. The look of terrified exhaustion on his face as he got off the back of my motorbike for the first time. I still have on my mantelpiece the model Honda he presented to me shortly after we started meeting.</p> <p>But, in truth, as we trudged round town in the rain when Pizza Hut was full, and when he uttered barely a word during two hours of pool, apart from his constant request for more salt 'n' vinegar crisps, I sometimes found it irksome. And during those moments, the question uppermost in my mind was: \"Why am I doing this?\"</p> <p><strong>Social conscience</strong></p> <p>My answer was not that I'm possessed of some great social conscience. I'm not. Nor that \"if I don't do it, nobody else will\". There are plenty of good people around to help him out. The honest and rather uninspiring answer is \"because I said I would\". I made a commitment to this shambling, often inarticulate youth, with his wisps of brown beard and his fag-burned baseball cap, and I intend to see it through.</p> <p>It is not that his life now is so much better for me having been his mentor. It is merely that perhaps it might have been that bit worse if I hadn't been around.</p> <p>As we leave the Italian and slope back to the carers with whom he was placed when he was on the road to recovery from the car accident, Luke says: \"You're a bit like a dad, really.\" I stop for a moment. Pondering my own middle-aged fecklessness, I think of the back-breaking work done by my friends who are real fathers. I feel rather callow. But then, as I remember that he has only spoken to his own father once, and never met him, I think: \"Maybe he's right.\" At which point, he summons up a large gobbet of phlegm, and my heart sinks as I wait for the inevitable expulsion.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Andrew Graham is a volunteer coordinator with Mentoring Plus. <a href=\"http://www.mentoringplus.net\">mentoringplus.net</a></p>",

If you want to meet a cabinet, your best bet is still probably to tune in to the Antiques Road Show, but it's good to know that the Downing Street version is coming to see us non-Londoners next month. The West Midlands is a dodgy choice for a debut - I'd have gone for somewhere more defined and resolute, such as Yorkshire - but the idea is sound. A bit weedy, though, to justify it to cynics and the carbon footprint gang by saying, \"We need to meet the people\", rather than the blunter, \"London isn't Britain, you know\".

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/robertfox\">Robert Fox</a> to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/simontisdall\">Simon Tisdall</a></p> <p>I am always sceptical about the success of specific ground operations, heralded from Washington and London in the terribly tangled mess of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. General David Petraeus launched his \"surge\" with some 35,000 extra troops in the spring of last year. Now, some of the extra troops are being brought home. Instead of victory, Washington talks about \"success\". <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/nov/01/usa.iraq\">Violence against US forces is down</a>, it is claimed \u2013 and this is undoubtedly true. The government in Baghdad under Nouri al-Maliki is stronger and the Iraq army has been growing in numbers and capability, and performing creditably in several areas, most notably in Basra. </p> <p>But problems remain, and this has been underlined by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/28/iraq.terrorism\">recent suicide bombings</a> in Kirkuk and Baghdad that killed at least 55 and injured more than 250. The targeting and tactics of the attacks suggests the hand of al-Qaida \u2013 the bombs were aimed at Shias in a religious procession and a demonstration of Kurds in Kirkuk. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/jun/09/guardianobituaries.alqaida\">Abu Musab al-Zarqawi</a>, the Jordanian founder of \"Al-Qaida in Mesopotamia\", preached against the \"axis of heresy\" linking Kurds, Shias and the American invader as the band of enemies against the true followers of Islam in Iraq. Zarqawi was betrayed and then killed by the Americans in 2006, but these recent bombs suggest his legacy lives on and al-Qaida is far from beaten by the Americans and the Sunni tribal militias. </p> <p>So, I think we can only say that the Petraeus surge is still very much a work in progress, and cannot be judged a magic ingredient that has suddenly turned the tide for the Americans in Iraq.</p> <p><strong>Simon Tisdall to Robert Fox:</strong></p> <p>To help understand what the \"the surge\" has (or has not) achieved, it is useful to cast one's mind back to the summer and autumn of 2006 when it appeared, to many if not most observers, that the US and its coalition partners were losing the battle to secure Iraq and that the country was sliding into a state of civil war. Coalition and civilian casualties were running at record highs, sectarian warfare following the bombing of the Shia shrines earlier that year was out of control, al-Qaida, led by the still extant Zarqawi, was striking with apparent impunity, and the isolated central government in Baghdad was powerless to act. Iraq appeared to be on the brink of anarchy encompassing all but Kurdish-controlled areas in the north and east.</p> <p>To make matters worse, Iran's al-Quds Revolutionary Guards operatives were busily stirring the pot, building up leverage especially in the south, and aiding those militants in Iraq, both Sunni and Shia, who were intent on forcing the Americans out. Under mounting pressure to admit defeat and throw in the towel, Bush acknowledged the gravity of the situation by ordering Pentagon and other policy reviews that autumn. The Baker-Hamilton Iraq Study Group was an independent, contemporaneous attempt to find a strategy that worked, or at least would cease to fail. In the end, what emerged was a decision to make one more big push to secure Iraq by sending in additional forces (\"the surge\"), rather than begin a phased withdrawal (which was what most people at the time expected would happen). I'm proud to say the Guardian exclusively <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/nov/16/iraq.topstories3\">revealed the surge decision</a> on November 16 2006 subsequently confirmed by the White House.</p> <p>It is incontrovertibly the case that the surge decision in November 2006 marked a critical turning point in the history of the US intervention in Iraq. Since that moment, the overall security situation, broadly defined, has slowly and unevenly improved, to the point where we can now realistically look forward to an Iraqi government taking primary responsibility for its citizens' safety and Bush can start cutting troop levels, as he did last week (Thursday July 31). This is not a victory, but neither is it the defeat that not so very long ago looked both certain and inevitable.<br> <strong>Robert Fox to Simon Tisdall</strong></p> <p>Undoubtedly, there have been improvements in security on the ground and an increase in capacity by the Iraqi army and the tribal militias now supporting the Malaki government in the Sunni triangle. But I think we have to look much further before we make judgments about turning points in the American strategy in Iraq. Sure, it may be a turning point, but not quite in the political direction intended. Rather like Chou en Lai being asked his view on the success of the French Revolution, I tend to think it is too early to make a definitive judgment on the success of the surge. Obviously, it is in the interest of the US presidential candidates to be positive about developments in Iraq \u2013 for both, it allows some much-needed room for manoeuvre to rebalance forces there and bring large numbers home.</p> <p>There is a very big \"but\" to all this, however. The surge is not entirely, nor even mainly, a military stratagem. It is political, and aimed at achieving America's political goal in Iraq \u2013 to achieve a stable, pro-American, functioning, unitary state at the heart of the Gulf security region. On this the jury is still out. There is still a lack of capacity in Malaki's government. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/may/30/iraq.uk\">police force</a> is weak and corrupt, and seems trapped in a cycle of underachievement. The Sunni tribal associations may be battling al-Qaida elements and paying lip service to the American line in order to get weapons, training and funds, but they are not pro-American, nor even pro a Shia-dominated government like al-Maliki's coalition. In the long run, they will turn away from the American-British axis. This is the opposite of the strategic aim of the surge.</p> <p>With operation <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/05/iraq.military\">Charge of the Knights</a>, the Iraq army and government have achieved a real and significant success. By all accounts, life in Basra is much changed, and for the better. But with this important tactical success, it should not be assumed that the problem of the Shia militias is resolved. The Mahdi militias of Moqtada al-Sadr appear weakened but not finished, down but not out. The rejectionism of the Sadrists, therefore, still appears unresolved. Additionally, there appears to be a serious threat of the dissident groups, on both sides of the sectarian divide, fragmenting into a perennial criminality.</p> <p><strong>Simon Tisdall to Robert Fox:</strong></p> <p>It's sensible to be cautious about long-terms gains occasioned by the \"surge\". The value, effectiveness and longevity of what has been achieved are open to question, as I wrote in my previous reply. Nothing in life is for ever and that applies with knobs on in Iraq. It could all go pear-shaped. Moqtada and his militiamen could make a comeback, the Sunni Awakening groups could go back to sleep, or turn on their US allies of convenience. Maliki could fail ... it's all possible. A senior US military official, a big proponent of the surge, told me recently that \"progress will not be linear\" and the \"enemy remains formidable\". Inserting caveats about future developments is necessary analytical practice in such a volatile situation.</p> <p>But to quote loosely another Chinese luminary, Confucius, \"he who walks in the middle of the road gets knocked down by traffic travelling both ways\". I'm in the right carriageway when I say I believe that a positive change for the better has been achieved that will have lasting benefits. Three reasons (but not the only ones) why I think this are: </p> <p>1) Iran, after years of malignly stirring the pot since 2003, has backed off since last autumn, having apparently decided that it is in its interests to support the much-strengthened Maliki government and, particularly, its timetable for an American withdrawal. Certainly, Tehran will hope to manipulate Maliki, but may find this harder as times goes by; </p> <p>2) Gulf Arab states, notably Saudi Arabia, are moving towards normalisation of relations, debt forgiveness and reconstruction collaboration with Iraq \u2013 despite its Shia-led government. This trend contradicts the \"polarisation and disintegration\" scenarios for Iraq that were so popular 18 months ago; </p> <p>3) US military reports say al-Qaida leaders are leaving Iraq and diverting new recruits away from the country. They're doing this because the security environment has got so much tougher.</p> <p>Unfortunately, they're not laying down their arms. Instead, they're heading for Aghanistan ...</p> <p><strong>Robert Fox to Simon Tisdall:</strong></p> <p>I think the real test of the surge is coming in the next few months. If the Americans pull back too soon, it can all fall apart. I am slightly more wary about Iran than you, Simon. I think Iranian policy towards Iraq, and the powerful Shia factions and parties, seems quite opaque. One minute, they seem to back either Hakim/SCIRI (ISCI) and Badr, then pull back. Moqtada has some clerical backing in Quom, notably from Grand Ayatollah Haeriri. Tehran seems to think it can manage Maliki. After all, they told him to avoid signing up to a permanent US presence in Iraq under the new status of forces agreement that will follow the UN mandate when it runs out at the end of the year. The test of stability will come with the provincial elections due soon, which will see a real distribution of power and spoils, particularly in the south.</p> <p>The Americans will have to say the surge has been a <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/iraq/article3803942.ece\">success</a> because they cannot sustain present force levels in Iraq and Afghanistan. The British will also try to claim a piece of the success with the \"turn around\" in Basra. They are desperate to be gone and I understand that Gordon Brown has arranged with Washington and Baghdad for the bulk of British forces to be away from Iraq by the beginning of next June, when an American division and headquarters will move into Basra. By that time, it will be clear if the surge has passed its main test \u2013 whether it has ensured that Iraq can hold together as a functioning state.</p> <p><strong>Simon Tisdall to Robert Fox:</strong></p> <p>The \"surge\" is already over in military terms. The additional combat brigades deployed by Bush last year have all gone home, and overall troop levels are down to pre-surge levels. Bush's announcement last week on cutting the duration of operational tours, and his acceptance of \"<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/18/AR2008071801308.html\">time horizons</a>\" for a withdrawal, follow on from the official US assessment that the surge has worked and indeed has been a success. The surge's main military proponent on the ground, General David Petraeus, has been promoted to CentCom, as have several of his key counterinsurgency advisers. The current offensive in Diyala suggests there is still much work to be done. And Kirkuk could still blow up at any time. But you are right about Baghdad, Basra and the Sunni Triangle. They are much improved security-wise.</p> <p>Politically speaking, I agree the longer-term success of the surge is still an open question. The provincial elections due this year may be postponed, mostly due to Kurdish objections about Kirkuk's future. That could prevent, or discourage, large-scale Sunni Arab participation. After their boycotting of previous polls, it was hoped the Sunnis would get involved in the political process this time, thereby increasing its credibility. This, in turn, could delay general elections next year. Other unpredictable political factors include the Iranian presidential election campaign and whether Ahmadinejad wins again; and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/uselections2008\">US presidential poll</a>, with both main candidates using Iraq for campaign purposes (witness McCain's jibes about Obama's supposed lack of interest in meeting fallen warriors). </p> <p>Making Iraq a united, functioning country also requires a lasting settlement of the oil question \u2013 that is, who gets and controls which bit of the vast oil and gas reserves. Opening the industry to foreign ownership and exploitation, as recently proposed, could further complicate things politically.</p> <p>The surge was never a panacea. It was, initially at least, a last desperate attempt to stop a haemorrhage with a large sticking plaster. It has worked better than most expected. Will the bleeding stop? Increasingly, the message coming from the US is: Iraqis must decide for themselves.</p> <p>What a pity Bush did not take that view about Saddam Hussein pre-2003.</p> <p><strong>Robert Fox to Simon Tisdall</strong></p> <p>I agree that the surge is drawing to a close as the extra brigades sent in by David Petraeus are now being brought home. The question is what happens next, both for Iraq and America. The surge had to come to an end because the next president, whether McCain or Obama, cannot maintain such a high level of defence expenditure \u2013 over half a trillion dollars per annum, and now greater than the aggregated defence budgets of the rest of the world. Moreover, a lot of the equipment of the ground forces is used up and needs replacing urgently. The US government is currently devoting over $100bn on the \"reset\" programme to bring in replacement equipment.</p> <p>In the UK, we are faced with the same phenomenon, though you wouldn't know it. The equipment of the forces in Helmand and Basra, not least the helicopter force, is under colossal strain. It is unlikely to be replaced sufficiently with new kit at the rate required because the equipment budget is under such severe strain. Moreover, as we have both noted, both the UK and US are likely to have to reinforce in Afghanistan soon \u2013 particularly if the Canadians reduced their forces in southern Afghanistan and the Dutch pull out, as many in their parliaments and much of their press are now demanding.</p>",
  "<p>I met Zakia in the restaurant of the UN compound in Kabul, partly because it was convenient and partly because there are still not that many public places for a western man to sit and talk to an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/afghanistan\">Afghan</a> woman alone.</p> <p>Zakia (not her real name) is a former director of an Afghan non-governmental organisation (NGO) the Humanitarian Assistance for Women and Children in Afghanistan (<a href=\"http://www.hawca.org/org_bg.htm\">HAWCA</a>), established in January 1999. It started as a simple humanitarian assistance group, helping vulnerable women and children, but now lists its objectives as \"promoting the role of women in society\" and \"supporting the reconstruction of the country.\" If Afghanistan has a future, it will be due to the efforts of people like Zakia who form part of a small but emerging civil society, determined to challenge the warlords and fundamentalists who still dominate the country's official politics.</p> <p>\"We need peace,\" says Zakia. \"The American's bombs are not the answer. The two sides will have to sit down and talk some day, so the only question is how many of us have to get killed before that happens.\" I press her about whether she would accept a role for the Taliban in government and she pauses before replying:</p> <blockquote> <p>Yes, this would be a big price to pay, but if they lay down their guns and accept the constitution, why not? After all, people with the same attitudes are already in the government. What is happening at the moment is worse because while the conflict continues our whole society is being Talibanised and corrupted.</p> </blockquote> <p>HAWCA lobbied actively during the debates that led up to the adoption of Afghanistan's <a href=\"http://arabic.cnn.com/afghanistan/ConstitutionAfghanistan.pdf\">constitution of 2002 (pdf)</a>. Zakia says that the outcome was \"a mix that could go in either direction.\" Articles two and three of the constitution state: \"The religion of the state of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan is the sacred religion of Islam\" and \"no law can be contrary to the beliefs and provisions of the sacred religion of Islam.\" Yet article seven states: \"The state shall abide by the UN charter, international treaties, international conventions that Afghanistan has signed, and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\"</p> <p>Zakia has worked with a network of Afghan women's groups and human rights organisations to press for legislative reforms, such as a law on ending violence against women. Along with the Afghan independent human rights commission, she was involved in a conference that drew on the experiences of a number of other countries with sharia legal systems to look at best practices for a new law on family relations. She also lobbied against a proposal in a draft penal procedure code that would have introduced a lower age of criminal responsibility for girls than for boys. After a meeting with President Karzai, he refused to sign these discriminatory proceedings into law.</p> <p>HAWCA has also helped to establish refuge centres for women escaping domestic violence \u2013 an enormously controversial issue in Afghanistan, where many judges and prosecutors still consider \"running away from home\" a criminal offence. It also participates in the Afghan women's network and a network of women parliamentarians. </p> <p>It runs education projects as well as health and childcare, counselling and protection, emergency response operations and support for income-generating activities. As well as its main office in Kabul, it also operates in seven other provinces in Afghanistan and with refugee groups across the Pakistan border in Peshawar. </p> <p>Voices like Zakia's are still comparatively isolated, but they are beginning to make themselves heard. In a country where girls are only beginning to receive an education again, it is not surprising that there are so few women professionals, opinion-formers and decision-makers. This will take time to change and social attitudes will take even longer.</p> <p>Afghanistan is a proud country, hospitable to guests, but has seen off <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/mar/11/athousandsplendidsuns1\">many foreign invaders</a>. Its people are as unlikely to be subdued by western bombs as they are to accept the imposition of what they as alien values. Zakia stresses that she is a Muslim and a patriot who is as sickened at the corruption of true Islamic values by the fundamentalists as she is by the continuing destruction of her country by foreign forces.</p> <p>Many western liberals seem to have a particular problem understanding people like Zakia, but the views that she expressed are representative of hundreds of conversations that I have had with Afghan friends and colleagues over the years. These express relief at the overthrow of the Taliban \u2013 and real gratitude to the international community for its initial intervention \u2013 tempered by frustration that the opportunity was not used to break the grip of the warlords and gangsters who have consolidated their position over the last six years. More recently I have also felt a growing anger at the ineffectiveness of the international community's assistance strategy and the inept and brutal conduct of its military campaign. There is still a window of opportunity to change the broad direction of western policy towards the country, but it is getting smaller by the day.</p>",

  "<p>In the funhouse world of big-time political journalism, inaccuracies must not be tolerated - but unverified smears are allowed to fester and ooze.</p> <p>Thus if you take a look at <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/29/AR2008072902068.html\">Dana Milbank's already-infamous Washington Post column</a> of last Wednesday - the one in which he wrote that Barack Obama had morphed from the \"presumptive nominee\" to the \"presumptuous nominee\" - you will find a correction informing readers that some inconsequential observation Obama had supposedly made to British prime minister Gordon Brown instead came about during a conversation with opposition leader David Cameron. Aren't you glad we've got that straight?</p> <p>What hasn't been corrected is the toxic quote that Milbank and, earlier, his fellow Post journalist Jonathan Weisman attributed to Obama during a closed meeting with Democratic congressional leaders. \"This is the moment ... that the world is waiting for,\" Obama supposedly said. \"I have become a symbol of the possibility of America returning to our best traditions.\"</p> <p>The quote is wrong on two levels. One is pretty basic: It saw the light of day because an anonymous source who was at the meeting claimed he'd heard Obama say it. Did this person have a tape recorder? Was he taking notes? Not likely. Weisman himself <a href=\"http://blog.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2008/07/29/obamas_symbolic_importance.html\">says there is no tape</a>. Those words never should have been put inside quotation marks.</p> <p>On a deeper level, though, the quote, even if accurate, appears not to be true, because the Post may have omitted - or, in Weisman's case, discounted - crucial context. According to Weisman's blog, an Obama campaign official said the candidate's actual words were more along these lines: \"It has become increasingly clear in my travel, the campaign - that the crowds, the enthusiasm, 200,000 people in Berlin, is not about me at all. It's about America. I have just become a symbol.\"</p> <p>Yet Weisman's snarky tone suggests that he thinks the campaign was merely covering its ass when it put forth that version. And Milbank, who, unlike Weisman, was writing for the more influential print edition, doesn't even mention it. The next day, Milbank participated in <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2008/07/25/DI2008072502073.html\">an online chat</a> in which he <a href=\"http://mediamatters.org/items/200808010004\">dismissed the complaints</a> of outraged Obama defenders as \"whines\".</p> <p>It is ever thus with the <a href=\"http://www.whatliberalmedia.com/\">so-called liberal media</a>, whose card-carrying members make their bones by kicking the tar out of liberal politicians. It's a game, and everyone understands the rules. By beating up on liberals on what appear to be cheap symbolic issues, the pundits borrow against future coverage, when they'll be criticising conservatives on more important matters like war, taxes and the environment.</p> <p>But as we've learned over the years, elections tend to be decided more on symbolism than on substance. And, as Milbank's sneering putdown shows, the media often can't be trusted even to get the symbolism right. If an anecdote fits the preordained frame - in this case, that <a href=\"http://thephoenix.com/Boston/News/65569-Leggo-my-ego/\">Obama is full of himself</a> - well, damn the facts, because this is just too good to check.</p> <p>What was the false symbolic narrative of Al Gore's campaign in 2000? Why, that he was a preening liar, of course. Right on cue, the media began <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/quotes/internet.asp\">falsely reporting</a> that Gore had claimed to have \"invented the internet\", quotation marks included. In an election decided by just one vote on the US supreme court, that may have been enough to tilt the outcome to George Bush.</p> <p>Or consider the hapless 2004 Democratic contender, John Kerry, cast as a pretentious phony. Kerry, inexplicably a fan of stock-car racing, was quoted by New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd as haughtily saying: \"Who among us doesn't like Nascar?\" As the incomparable <a href=\"http://www.dailyhowler.com/dh100204.shtml\">Bob Somerby has shown</a>, Kerry not only never spoke those words, but Dowd wasn't even there. Yet the phrase was gleefully repeated dozens of times during the 2004 campaign, including, on several occasions, by Dowd's Times colleagues.</p> <p>It would have been nice if Washington Post ombudsman Deborah Howell had dealt with Milbank's hit-and-run attack this past Sunday. <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/01/AR2008080102874.html\">But she didn't</a>, and apparently she's not going to say anything this coming Sunday, either.</p> <p>She should. Because it is upon such falsehoods that the electoral narrative is built. The Republicans, through such tricks as their <a href=\"http://gop.com/audacitywatch\">Audacity Watch</a>, are trying to build up John McCain by tearing down Obama as a self-regarding elitist who's already acting like he's president.</p> <p>Obama is hardly a perfect candidate. His moves to the centre, though predictable, have been awkwardly executed - his weekend <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/aug/05/barackobama.uselections2008\">switch on offshore oil drilling</a> being just the latest example. His long association with the Rev Jeremiah \"God damn America!\" Wright <a href=\"http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2008/03/throughout-his.html\">remains problematic</a>, and you can be sure we haven't heard the last of it.</p> <p>But that's no excuse for the media to cobble semi-reported, anonymously sourced tidbits into a fake narrative that mockingly suggests Obama is already starting to make plans for his second term.

  "<p>Freddie Mac, the mortgage firm that had to be rescued by the US government last month, was warned as early as 2004 that dubious loans were compromising its financial health. </p> <p>Freddie's former chief risk officer, David Andrukonis, told the New York Times that he sent chief executive Richard Syron a memo in mid-2004 showing Freddie's underwriting standards were slipping and potential liabilities were widening. </p> <p>He says he warned Syron at a meeting that the number of bad loans \"would likely pose an enormous financial and reputational risk to the company and the country\". </p> <p>But, according to Andrukonis, the response was blithe: \"He said we couldn't afford to say no to anyone.\" </p> <p>Freddie and its sister firm, Fannie Mae, play a crucial role in the US financial system by guaranteeing nearly half of the country's mortgage debt. </p> <p>A crisis of confidence erupted last month when it became clear they faced losses far higher than initially feared in the meltdown in US sub-prime home loans. </p> <p>Shares in Freddie have fallen by 77% since the beginning of the year.

  "<p>The long-running game of cat and mouse between John Gotti, or Junior as he is known to friends and victims alike, and the FBI started a new round today when the former head of the notorious Gambino crime family was arrested in connection with three New York murders.</p> <p>Gotti was taken into custody by a dozen agents in a swoop on his Long Island home involving helicopters which his lawyer complained had turned the event into a public spectacle. The charges that will be pressed on him are understood to relate to a drug ring operated in New York, New Jersey and Florida and the killings that date back to the late 1980s and early 1990s.</p> <p>Gotti, 44, has been the subject of FBI interest on and off for years. </p> <p>He served five years between 1999 and 2005 for racketeering, then he was almost immediately put on trial for an earlier attack on the founder of the Guardian Angels, Curtis Sliwa. Three attempts to nail him all ended in mistrials and the charges were dropped.</p> <p>Such has been the intensity of the FBI's focus on him that Gotti has sought to present himself as a victim of judicial harassment. He claims to have renounced all mafia involvement and after the most recent attempt last November to put him back behind bars for failure to pay taxes, he raged that prosecutors were putting his families lives in danger. </p> <p>\"What happens next? Does it make it all better if I get one in my head? Does it make it all better if I'm found in the street?\"</p> <p>The latest move against the Gambinos emerges from a widening investigation by federal prosecutors based in Tampa, Florida, into an alleged mafia drug ring. Five suspects have already been charged, including Ronald \"Ronnie One Arm\" Trucchio who has already been sentenced to life in prison, and John Alite who is facing trial having been extradited from Brazil to Florida.</p> <p>Gotti's lawyer, Charles Carnesi, told the Tampa Tribune that his client was frustrated by the continual investigations of him. He pointed out that all three trials from 2005 against him had ended in hung juries. </p> <p>\"Now, after the third hung jury, the idea now that suddenly in Tampa, there is new information, previously unknown about this kid, who has been investigated, ad nauseam for at least the last five years or so, doesn't make any sense to me.\"</p> <p>The news that Junior Gotti was to be dragged yet again before a Manhattan court house today underlined the slow but steady decline of America's mafia families. </p> <p>In their heyday in the 1950s they were as a mob financier once put it \"bigger than US Steel\", their special interests ranging from racketeering to illegal gambling and drugs.</p> <p>The Gambinos were one of five great New York mob clans, or borgatas, the others being Bonanno, Colombo, Genovese and Lucchese. They settled their differences between them through their ruling Commission, or when that failed at the point of a gun.</p> <p>For years the Gambinos were run by the colourful John Gotti Sr whose taste for bespoke suits earned him the moniker Dapper Don. His ability to wriggle out of the clutches of the Feds also earned him a second nickname: Teflon Don.</p> <p>But his brutal style of leadership and the growing number of turncoats in the mafia eventually caught up with him.

  "<p>Portuguese police drew up e-fits of possible suspects in Madeleine McCann's abduction but failed to make them public, files released today revealed.</p> <p>Two computer images were created based on witness accounts on May 6 last year, just three days after the little girl vanished. </p> <p>However, authorities took the decision not to circulate the pictures, although doing so might have assisted their search. </p> <p>Instead, the images have been made public for the first time today as part of a detailed dossier into the failed investigation.</p> <p>The latest revelation into police efforts to find Madeleine comes as documents also showed Portuguese prosecutors believed \"very little\" conclusive evidence about the fate of the three-year-old had been uncovered.</p> <p>In their final report, officials noted that detectives working on the case had even failed to prove whether the missing three-year-old was dead or alive.</p> <p>The document \u2014 dated July 21, the day the investigation was officially shelved \u2014 was made public as part of the massive dossier of evidence assembled over the 14-month investigation.</p> <p>Portuguese authorities released the police files yesterday after lifting the period of judicial secrecy in the case.</p> <p>The final volume of the files contained a 58-page report written by public prosecutors Jose de Magalhaes e Menezes and Joao Melchior Gomes. In it they said Madeleine's parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, did not \"act with intent\" in leaving their children alone in their holiday apartment on the night the child went missing.</p> <p>\"They could not predict that in the resort they chose they could place the life of any of their children in danger,\" the prosecutors wrote.</p> <p>They noted the McCanns were \"already serving a heavy sentence\" \u2014 Madeleine's disappearance \u2014 for going out to dinner without their children.</p> <p>Portuguese detectives were unable to provide evidence that would allow the \"formulation of any lucid, sensible, serious and honest conclusion\" about the circumstances of the child going missing, the report said.</p> <p>It continued: \"This includes the most dramatic thing \u2014 ascertaining whether she is still alive or dead, which seems the most probable.</p> <p>\"The investigators are fully conscious their work is not exempt from imperfections. They worked with an enormous margin of error and achieved very little in terms of conclusive results, especially about the fate of the unfortunate child.</p> <p>\"This is not, unfortunately, a detective novel, a crime scenario fit for the investigative efforts of a Sherlock Holmes or Hercule Poirot, guided by the illusion that the forces of law and justice can always re-establish order.\"</p> <p>The police files include details of the lines of inquiry, forensic reports, pictures of the bedroom where Madeleine was sleeping before she disappeared, and transcripts of interviews with the McCanns.</p> <p>Documents from the dossier \u2014 amounting to more than 11,000 pages \u2014 have already revealed that detectives claimed the young girl's DNA had been found in her parents' hire car despite a British scientist's warning days earlier that tests were inconclusive.</p> <p>Today, a family friend of the McCanns accused Portuguese officers of trying to extract a confession from Madeleine's father by lying about the results of forensic analysis.</p> <p>Clarence Mitchell, spokesman for the 40-year-olds from Rothley, Leicestershire, said: \"You have to ask what the police were trying to achieve by over-presenting evidence that they did not have, and clearly could not claim to have.\"</p> <p>Lawyers for the McCanns were given access to the files last week.

  "<p>The two assailants behind China's deadliest militant assault in a decade were Islamic jihadis intent on turning 2008 into a \"year of mourning\" for the Olympic host nation, the Chinese authorities claimed today.</p> <p>Shi Dagang, the local Communist party chief, described yesterday's killing of 16 police in Kashgar as part of a well-plotted and long-planned attack.</p> <p>He vowed to fight back against separatist forces whom he accused of plotting \"monthly major events\" until the end of the Olympics.</p> <p>He said two local men from the Uighur ethnic group - named as Kebanyan Ahmet and Abdul Rahman - had confessed to carjacking a truck and driving it into paramilitary police who were out jogging. </p> <p>The men then lobbed home-made bombs at the survivors, attacking others with knives. Sixteen officers were injured in the attack, and two remain in a critical condition.</p> <p>One suspect lost an arm in an explosion. Police said they later found nine unused bombs, two knives, two daggers, a gun and a letter among the assailants' possessions.</p> <p>In the letter, the attackers - one a vegetable seller, the other a taxi driver - reportedly stated that religious beliefs were more important than their own lives and they would devote themselves to jihad, or holy war.</p> <p>No evidence was presented to directly link the two men to separatist Uighur groups who want to create an \"East Turkestan\" homeland in Xinjiang, the westernmost region of China that borders Pakistan, Afghanistan and several other central Asian nations.</p> <p>Shi said the attack had come at a time when East Turkestan groups at home and abroad were using the internet to plot attacks on the Beijing games and spread information about bomb-making and chemical warfare.</p> <p>\"Their aim is to use simple means to attack the Chinese government and to turn 2008 into a year of mourning,\" he said.</p> <p>He named three organisations - the East Turkestan Islamic Movement, the East Turkestan Liberation Organisation and the East Turkestan Independent Movement - as would-be attackers.</p> <p>Amid concerns that more attacks may take place before the Olympics, police set up checkpoints around the Silk Road city, 3,000 miles west of Beijing, while riot police ringed the hospital where the injured officers were being treated.</p> <p>Several local residents said they were facing extra identity-card checks and door-to-door inspections. The main bazaar was closed early and traders were forbidden from praying at their workplace. </p> <p>Stallholders said they were scared to talk about the incident or discuss their feelings towards Chinese rule. </p> <p>\"It is dangerous to discuss such things,\" one spice seller said. \"One wrong word and you can end up in prison.\"</p> <p>Among a dozen or so people approached by the Guardian, more than half said their lives had improved in the past five years thanks to China's economic growth, but others expressed frustration at controls on Islam.</p> <p>\"There is no religious freedom,\" a student said. \"I can only wear a long dress and headscarf at home because it is forbidden at my university.\" </p> <p>Teachers in the public school system are dismissed if they grow beards, which are seen as a sign of religious belief.</p> <p>At the Idkah mosque, in the main square, authorities posted a sign warning worshippers that they were committing a crime if they visited Mecca as individuals rather than going on a tour organised by state-affiliated religious organisations. </p> <p>\"Organised and planned prayer is national policy,\" begins the document. \"Muslim citizens should not believe the lies of those who want to organise illegal trips.\"</p> <p>Some Uighurs fear cultural assimilation and the plunder of their oil and minerals resources by the Han ethnic group, which makes up the vast majority elsewhere in China. </p> <p>Since the Communist party took power in 1949, Han settlers and their families have gone from being less than one-tenth of the Xinjiang population to more than half.</p> <p>Dilxat Raxit, spokesman for the exiled World Uighur Congress, said the government had rounded up many Uighurs in Kashgar following the attack.</p> <p>\"We oppose any violence, whether by Uighurs or Chinese,\" he told Reuters. \"We urge international society to put pressure on China to freely let journalists report from Kashgar and deal with the issue legally and not go after innocent Uighurs.\"</p> <p>His claim about the rounding up of Uighurs could not be confirmed. </p> <p>However, the authorities were heavy-handed in dealing with some foreign journalists.</p> <p>Police forcibly removed two Japanese reporters from a public street, beating them and damaging their equipment. </p> <p>Masami Kawakita, a photographer for the Tokyo Chunichi Sports newspaper who is in China for the Olympics, said he was surrounded by paramilitaries, lifted off the floor by his arms and legs and kicked.</p> <p>He said a policeman had put a boot on his face, pinning him to the floor, and that he now feels pain in an elbow and the ribs on his right side. \"It was unbelievable,\" he added.</p> <p>Senior police officers have apologised, but it is unclear whether the culprits were punished.</p>",
  "<p>The Bishop of Uganda has taken a tough line on the British empire. Henry Orombi has denounced the Archbishop of Canterbury's decision to invite some pro-gay American clergy to the Lambeth conference as a \"remnant of <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article4438729.ece\">British colonialism</a>\". He and his fellow Ugandan bishops have refused to attend the conference as an act of passive resistance to the \"clear violation of biblical teaching\". </p> <p>Inspiring though it might be to hear anti-colonial views at a time when the British empire and its legacies are often justified and celebrated, there's a small problem here. For the Anglican church in Uganda is itself not exactly a non-colonial institution. It too is one of the great legacies (\"remnants\") of colonialism in Africa \u2013 embraced by many, like the English language or the railways \u2013 but derived from the colonial project nevertheless. The spread of Christianity in Africa, through missionary activity and the consequent establishment of churches and an African clerisy was very much part of colonial rule, even if British missionaries and administrators did not always agree on how to deal with subject populations. The training and ordination of local African priests who would proselytise more effectively and convert their heathen brethren to Christian ways was integral to the consolidation of colonialism's \"civilising mission\". Given this genealogy, it is not clear that the good bishop is himself in a good position from which to attack a fellow priest as a \"colonial\". </p> <p>This kind of tendentious anti-colonialism, coming from quarters not otherwise known for radicalism, is part of a phenomenon that might be called the \"blacking\" of homophobia. This dismaying process has made it acceptable for some members of cultural and ethnic minorities not only to articulate intolerant views (which they would not accept if directed against themselves), but to have these prioritised in the name of religious sensitivities and cultural difference. So it was with the judicial validation of Nigerian-born registrar Lydia Ladele's <a href=\"http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-23432144-details/Registrar+who+says+she+won't+do+gay+weddings...+and+is+now+taking+council+to+a+tribunal/article.do\">refusal to conduct</a> same-sex civil partnerships because it violated her \"devout Christian\" beliefs. Far from being progressive, the upholding of such rigid beliefs is often premised on the pervasive, nonsensical and frankly, colonial, idea that non-Europeans are instinctively more \"religious\" and should therefore be exempt from engaging with the demands of democratic legislation and a diverse society. </p> <p>While homosexuality has come under attack in many cultures at different points in history, the irony is that this particularly immoveable form of hate and intolerance, <a href=\"http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/8/12/638231\">expressed by Orombi</a> in the name of Christian love, was institutionalised by colonial law. Far from being critical of colonialism, the bishop's insistence on his reading of the scriptures as the only correct one is, in fact, indicative of a deeply colonised mindset, where extremely literal readings of the written word replaced more fluid customary law and oral interpretive traditions. In India, activists have been fighting a campaign to repeal a 19th century colonial law that criminalised homosexuality, \"carnal intercourse against the order of nature\". <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jun/30/india.gayrights\">This campaign</a> \u2013 not the call to further entrench outdated colonial ideas \u2013 is the real movement towards decolonisation and eliminating the \"remnants\" of colonialism. </p> <p>The tragedy for the larger Anglican communion is that the intolerance once spread abroad in the name of Christianity has now returned to haunt and hold back its laudable attempts to move forward. But in undoing this colonial legacy, it should not be deterred by false accusations of colonialism. Hatred is not love and homophobia is not anti-colonialism.</p>",
  "<h2>Where did the attack happen?</h2> <p>The Xinjiang Autonomous Region lies in China's north west, bordering central Asia. Covering a sixth of the country's total territory, it is a vast but sparsely populated area with around 19 million inhabitants. Around 8 million are Turkic-speaking Uighur Muslims, concentrated in the south of the region around cities such as Kashgar, known to the Chinese as Kashi, which lies around 2,500 miles from Beijing.</p> <h2>Why is there tension in the region?</h2> <p>Increasing controls on religious and cultural activity, large scale Han Chinese migration and economic marginalisation have all played a part, said Nicholas Bequelin of Human Rights Watch, who has researched the area extensively.</p> <p>The proportion of Han Chinese inhabitants rose from 6% in 1949 to 40% by around 2000 and migrants had begun to spread from cities into rural areas, where they found themselves in competition with Uighur communities for water and land. Many Uighurs complain that they have not benefited from the region's economic development, finding it harder to access benefits such as government grants or bank loans.</p> <p>\"The political reality of southern Xinjiang is that Uighurs don't see themselves as Chinese,\" added Bequelin. But while some seek a separate \"East Turkestan\", others merely hope for greater cultural freedom.</p> <h2>Has the area seen previous acts of violence?</h2> <p>Xinjiang has experienced sporadic outbursts of separatist activity and more general anti-government protest.</p> <p>\"It may be that as many as a couple of hundred have been killed by separatists alone [since the early 90s], and of course people have been executed or killed in police raids,\" said Professor Barry Sautman, a specialist in ethnic politics in China at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.</p> <p>Violence peaked in 1997, with fatal bus bombings and riots after a peaceful protest was suppressed. Experts believe the ensuing security crackdown halted the violence but exacerbated underlying tensions.</p> <p>Amnesty International alleges that as many as 200 Uighurs were executed between 1997-99. Mark Allison, its East Asia researcher, says Uighurs have been punished for peaceful protests \u2014 or even cultural expression \u2014 as well as violent activity.</p> <p>\"What we have documented in the past is a much broader crackdown \u2014 particularly after September 11 and the global war on terror,\" he said.<br>\"It's the only place in China where political prisoners are regularly sentenced to death and executed.\"</p> <h2>Are the Olympics safe?</h2> <p>Most analysts believe that yesterday's attack was timed to maximise publicity. But few believe that separatists will attack venues, spectators or athletes directly particularly given the intense security in Beijing and other host cities.</p> <p>The Chinese authorities allege they have disrupted several Olympics-related separatist plots, but have provided little evidence. Last week the army official in charge of security said Uighur separatists represented the greatest threat to the games, while Xinjiang's vice-governor said there were \"only a very small number of sabotage activities and many were nipped in the bud\".</p> <p>Andrew Gilholm, senior China analyst at the Control Risks consultancy, said the raid resembled attacks in the 90s, and did not indicate a new<br>threat. He added: \"Claims [of plots] have never been completely made up, but have probably often been exaggerated and misrepresented, at least from around 2002 until recently.\"</p> <h2>Who launched this attack?</h2> <p>As yet, no one has claimed responsibility. The state media reported that security officials suspected the East Turkestan Islamic Movement \u2014 often blamed for alleged plots \u2014 of planning pre-Olympic attacks. But Colin Mackerras, an expert on the region and emeritus professor at Griffith University, Australia, cautioned: \"There are quite a few groups<br>and the Chinese usually lump them all together as ETIM.\"</p> <p>Earlier this year Beijing also accused Hizb ut-Tahrir of planning raids; the group denied the claims, adding that since 2001 autocratic regimes had<br>used the \"war on terror\" as an excuse to clamp down on political opposition. In a recent video, three men who said they represented the little-known Turkestan Islamic Party threatened Olympic attacks and claimed responsibility for recent blasts in Chinese cities, but both the government and independent analysts doubt their involvement in those incidents. Some experts believe ETIM and TIP are one and the same.</p> <h2>How substantial is the threat posed by terrorists?</h2> <p>James Millward of Georgetown University in the US, an expert on Uighur separatism, has said he has yet to see evidence of a large, organised separatist or terrorist group.</p> <p>ETIM has been deemed a terrorist group by the UN and the US. But while there is evidence of links between ETIM and al-Qaida, most analysts believe those connections are historic and several believe they were exaggerated. Gilholm said that while the TIP claims did not appear credible, the method and rhetoric used to deliver the threat were worrying in themselves: \"Most of those [previous] groups have identified themselves as Uighur separatists, not as part of the wider Islamist terrorist agenda.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>Hometown:</strong> London. <br> <strong>The lineup:</strong> Gwen Atom and Marc Atom (songs, instruments and \"cosmic glue\"). <br> <strong>The background:</strong> \"Sugar\" is just one of those words that sound good in a pop song. There have been some great \"sugar\" songs, and more often than not they wind up in the charts: Brown Sugar by the Stones, Sugar Sugar by the Archies, Sugar Me by Lynsey De Paul, Sugar Candy Kisses by Mac &amp; Katie Kissoon, Sugar Walls by Sheena Easton, Sugar Hiccup by the Cocteau Twins. Oh, Atoms, a new group with a past, chose well when they decided to make the first song they ever wrote together about sugar mice, or at least to use confectionery rodents as the launch pad for a lovely meditation on childhood, life, nostalgia, fear, wonder and hope. Because it inspired them to create something cute and memorable, about memory and being cute, and because the song in question, Sugar Mouse, attracted the attention of Gurinder (Bend It Like Beckham) Chadha, who put it in her latest film Angus Thongs and Perfect Snogging. Not bad for a song hastily cobbled together in a Hackney attic, and not a bad way out of the traps for folk-pop duo Oh, Atoms, who comprise Gwen Atom and Marc Atom, so-called because their real names are Gwen Cheeseman and Marc Withecomb and, well, you would, wouldn't you? <br> Actually, we say \"folk-pop\" because they use \"real\" instruments, non-acoustic ones are used sparingly, and voices are clear and to the fore, but note we say folk-pop, because there's a sugary, sweet, bubblegum quality to their songs that puts them in a different category to the folk-rock, nu-folk or alt-folk brigades. They've been in a variety of outfits, including Psapp, another group still clinging to childhood with their penchant for toy instruments, but their sudden, wide exposure via Angus Thongs\u2026 makes the duo seem like an overnight sensation. And although Sugar Mouse, which opens with a dramatic sweep of strings and some jauntily plucked banjos before Gwen's cutey-pie voice coos into focus, is probably their best song, their forthcoming album, You Can't See the Stars From Here, shows some depth and range. Shaftsbury Drill has a mariachi feel. Lucky Motel has a dreamy, reverb-y, Julee Cruise-y vibe. Nylon and Leather is Magic Numbers-ishly summery and sprightly. This is Not Your Song is heavy on the violins and recalls the achingly pretty chamber-pop of Shelleyan Orphan. Five Over Stripe tries to rock out and be all raunchy and dirty but Oh, Atoms are best when they're wimpy and wet, frankly. Ice Cream Blonde is more like it, with its minor-key melody and air of malady. Transcontinental has a tinny old drum machine beat, but it's really catchy and the obvious next single. Little Victories is forlorn, country-ish, with harmonica. It's generic stuff, derivative as hell, but they're not pretending to be Einst\u00fcrzende Neubauten colliding with Danja, they are what they are, and it's all really rather, well, sweet.  <strong>The buzz:</strong> \"Glorious folk-pop with an undeniable commercial underbelly. Sugar Mouse is the sound of sunshine being let out of a jar on a rainy day.\"<br> <strong>The truth:</strong> Meet the folk-pop Ting Tings. <br> <strong>Most likely to:</strong> Make 70s sweets popular.<br> <strong>Least likely to:</strong> Get the thumbs-up from dentists. <br> <strong>What to buy:</strong> Sugar Mouse is available now as a free download from <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/ohatoms\">www.myspace.com/ohatoms</a>.

  "<p>The British Olympic Association chairman Colin Moynihan is confident of a significant improvement in Great Britain's medal haul at Beijing but has described predictions they could overhaul Australia to finish fourth in Beijing as \"unwise\".</p> <p>Britain finished 10th in Athens with nine gold medals and are targeting fourth place at London 2012, but the BOA is refusing to set a specific target for the Games in China. Some predictions have forecast Britain doubling their gold medal tally but Moynihan was reluctant to raise expectations. \"We do have a very strong team, better financed and better resourced than ever, and I believe this will deliver the goods and we will move significantly forward from 10th,\" said Moynihan at Team GB's pre-Games launch in Beijing.</p> <p>\"For a number of sports we also want to see real progress towards 2012. We are confident we will move forward from 10th but it would be unwise to speculate how close we will get to fourth. At Athens, the combined margin of five British golds being silver medals was only 0.545sec - that shows how close it can be.\"</p> <p>UK Sport, the body that distributes National Lottery funding to Olympic sports, has denied a report claiming that it has changed its target of 35 British medals at Beijing. \"The target of 35 medals and eighth place in the medal table remains the same,\" a spokesman said. \"We do have a 'stretch target' of 41 medals that we would hope to achieve if everything goes right and that also remains the same.\"</p> <p>Moynihan insisted there was no chance of the BOA watering down its lifetime ban on drugs cheats. The organisation is reviewing the rule following the Dwain Chambers court challenge and there was a possibility of falling in line with the IOC's new rule under which an athlete banned for six months or more misses the Olympics after their suspension finishes.</p> <p>But Moynihan said the only likely change would be to the BOA's appeals procedure. \"I do not anticipate the BOA changing the by-law at all,\" he said. \"What we need to do is look at the appeal mechanism. The rest of the world is looking at what we do and a number are considering having similar eligibility rules.</p> <p>\"Ultimately the reason we have the by-law is that it is asked for by the athletes. We carry out a poll after every Games and there has never been less than 90% supporting it. There is a huge challenge for sport to make sure we have competition between athletes and not between chemist laboratories.\"</p>",

  "<p>Last week, the government released a <a href=\" www.justice.gov.uk/docs/murder-manslaughter-infanticide-consultation.pdf\">consultation paper (pdf)</a>, Murder, manslaughter and infanticide: proposals for reform of the law. It was designed to take steps towards bringing murder law in England and Wales into the 21st century. Now that the dust has settled slightly on the \"gender-based\" <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/new-murder-laws-may-send-wrong-message-880321.html\">provocation proposals</a>, it is good to debate the rest of the changes proposed and also to revisit those key changes more reflectively.</p> <p> It has been clear for some time that reform was needed \u2013 there has been no change to homicide law in 50 years. In 2003, the Law Commission, which had been asked to review the partial defences that cut a potential murder conviction back to manslaughter, concluded that though it could produce such a report, the better course was to let it undertake a thorough review of murder laws. The government acceded and the resulting consultation and report produced wide-ranging proposals, including to the whole structure of homicide law. The review was always a double-decker, with the commission going first and the government consulting afterwards. That second step has produced a real measure of consensus around the plans set out in this consultation but much less on the rest of the Law Commission's scheme. That is why we will try to make progress where there is agreement and review the rest when these changes have bedded down.</p> <p>The high points of the changes are in three major proposals to change the laws about diminished responsibility, complicity in homicide and, of course, provocation. </p> <p>The definition of diminished responsibility, set out in the <a href=\"http://www.opsi.gov.uk/RevisedStatutes/Acts/ukpga/1957/cukpga_19570011_en_1\">Homicide Act 1957</a>, was, like provocation, a defence introduced, or more accurately, beefed up, primarily as a mitigation to the rigours of the death penalty. It is a partial defence which allows a conviction for manslaughter only, where a defendant's responsibility for killing is diminished by what is currently called \"an abnormality of mind\". The defence has not changed significantly since its inception. So it is still grounded in 1957 psychiatry and does not square with modern medical thinking.</p> <p>To their immense credit, the commission worked very closely with forensic psychiatrists to ensure that the defence would come into better alignment with contemporary psychiatric understanding of mental functioning. The proposed new definition will be effective where the diminution of responsibility is caused by a \"recognised medical condition\". That issue will be determined by medical evidence where relevant. The related question of whether an impairment of responsibility is \"substantial' enough to reduce culpability from murder to manslaughter will be for the jury to determine, looking at all the facts surrounding the killing and examining whether the medical condition played a determining role. The current law is not clear about this division and, while in some cases psychiatrists comment on the \"substantialness\" of the impairment, sometimes they refuse to do so. </p> <p>We also propose to streamline the law of complicity to homicide and to set it out in statute. This should make it easier for courts to determine liability where more than one person has been involved in a killing. The current law is scattered across a number of court of appeal and House of Lords judgments. It is complicated and suffers from overlapping provisions and some duplication. These provisions cover gang crime and so are extremely important. The law should be clear, sending out an unmistakable message about the consequences for every member of a criminal gang if any member of it commits homicide.</p> <p>In 2005, almost half of all those convicted of murder were acting in company. When it is foreseeable \u2013 perhaps because that person is carrying a weapon \u2013 that one gang member may kill or cause really serious harm in the course of a criminal outing of any kind, then all the participants will be guilty of murder. At present, if such a killing is well beyond the scope of the criminal enterprise, the other gang members will be acquitted. If these measures come into force, they will all be convicted of at least manslaughter. That is because criminal enterprises frequently turn violent and their participation and encouragement of that risk means that they must take responsibility. This represents a significant broadening of criminal responsibility with which most of the Law Commission's consultees totally agreed. It is important that the law backs up police action and other cross-government moves that have been made in order to take on gang violence and, in particular, gun and knife crime. It is equally important that the law apportions blame among defendants appropriately and justly. </p> <p>The decision to abolish and replace the partial defence of provocation, has caused intense debate in the media. Yet it is clear that the law is out of date and wrong. It is both too lenient on those who kill out of anger and too harsh on those who kill out of fear of violence.</p> <p>The gender issue in the proposals centres on domestic violence killings. Men who kill out of anger can plead that they were provoked to lose their self-control by something done or said by the victim. In the past that has plea has been used to blame women for their own deaths because they had affairs, demeaned his sexual prowess or threatened to leave home. Women who kill, as about 20 women a year do, out of fear of violence, cannot easily fit into the same defence. Typically, they strike out with a knife in fear as their partners approach to inflict another beating.</p> <p>Thus they go too far for self-defence, which only permits a response proportionate to the violence aimed at them. Yet they are not easily seen as acting because they have been provoked to a loss of self-control. That is a model that fits anger and is not so easily applicable to fear. The court of appeal has done its best, out of a sense that this was a justice gap, to stretch provocation until it fits the fear model. This has helped a number of female defendants. However, it continues to be an uneasy fit. So the risk remains that while men who kill in anger are convicted of manslaughter, women, who respond in fear, to domestic violence can be convicted of murder. Therefore it has been proposed that the defence of provocation be abolished. In the 21st century neither men nor women should be even partially excused if they lose control and kill in anger. </p> <p>But it is right to retain a residual fragment of provocation where really exceptional circumstances make a jury accept that a defendant killed after losing control because of a justifiable sense of being seriously wronged. This will not be available for day to day situations but only exceptionally and where the conduct of the \"provoker\" is morally wrong in the eyes of the jury \u2013 the current law does not require that that conduct should be wrong, only provoking. The proposed clauses exclude sexual infidelity from being dealt with as an \"exceptional circumstance\" thus, rightly, ending its use as a defence to murder. Of course this, like all defences, will be available to men and women alike.</p> <p>The other provision in place of provocation will be killing because of a loss of control caused by fear of serious violence. This will fit those domestic violence sufferers. It will also save from a murder conviction a person attacked in the street who overreacts to the frightening situation and kills his attacker. </p> <p>Both the current law of provocation and the proposed new laws only work where there is a loss of self-control. As I have said, defendants have had to characterise that loss as having been caused less by fear and more by anger in order to fit the provocation defence. Now they will be able to use the defence of their fear. </p> <p>Some people are so undermined by long-term abuse that they cannot leave their partners. If such a person, told by the drunken perpetrator that they are going to be beaten senseless when he wakes, loses her self-control and kills him in fear, anticipating that serious violence, the new defence could be claimed. Equally such a person might perhaps claim that they had a justifiable sense of being seriously wronged. </p> <p>Whether either defence would succeed would depend on whether a jury believed in the loss of self-control and didn't think that this was a cold-blooded killing. If that were so, it would not materially differ from the long-held rule that people threatened with attack need not wait to be hit before striking out. They are entitled to a pre-emptive strike, to prevent themselves suffering a beating. In self-defence there need be no loss of self-control. For violence going beyond self-defence, loss of self-control will have to be shown in order to harness the new partial defence. </p> <p>All of these proposals are intended to modernise the law of homicide.</p>",
  "<p>Japanese electronics giant Sony is buying its partner Bertelsmann out of their Sony BMG music joint venture, home to artists including Mark Ronson and Bruce Springsteen, in a deal worth $1.2bn (\u00a3614m) to the German media group.</p> <p>The move, which has been rumoured for some months, could provide Bertelsmann with the financial firepower to buy all or part of BSkyB's controversial 17.9% stake in ITV.</p> <p>There has been persistent talk that Bertelsmann's RTL business, which owns Five in the UK, is interested in buying up Sky's stake. The competition commission demanded that the stake be reduced to under 7.5% and Sky launched an appeal. While waiting for the outcome of that appeal, Sky is understood to have received informal approaches from a number of potential buyers.</p> <p>These are rumoured to have included TV producer Endemol, Italy's Mediaset and Israeli-American media mogul Haim Saban as well as RTL.</p> <p>Sony has been negotiating with Bertelsmann for some months about acquiring control of Sony BMG, which they created in August 2004 by pooling their music labels.</p> <p>Sony BMG already had $600m in cash on its balance sheet, which was split equally between the two owners. Bertelsmann will take all that cash, plus Sony is paying a further $600m for the business.</p> <p>Sony BMG will now become Sony Music Entertainment Inc (SMEI). As part of the transaction, the parties have also agreed to continue to share the company's manufacturing and distribution requirements between Sony's manufacturing subsidiary, Sony DADC, and Bertelsmann's services company, Arvato Digital Services by extending the agreements with Arvato for additional terms of up to six years. In addition, Bertelsmann will be taking over selected European music catalogue assets from Sony BMG.</p> <p>\"Music has been a vital and vibrant part of Sony's culture for over 20 years,\" said Sir Howard Stringer, chairman and CEO, Sony Corporation. \"This acquisition will allow us to achieve a deeper and more robust integration between the wide-ranging global assets of the music company and Sony's products, operating companies and affiliates. It enables us to offer a total entertainment experience to consumers,\" </p> <p>Bertelsmann refused to say what it intends to do with the cash raised.</p> <p>\"After a careful and thorough review, we made the strategic decision to sell our investment in this joint venture to Sony, a step that we believe will benefit the stakeholders of both our companies,\" stated Hartmut Ostrowski, chairman and CEO of Bertelsmann. \"This move is consistent with our new growth strategy and will enable us to focus on our defined growth areas. Sony has been an excellent partner, and they are the right company to take this business to the next step and ensure that it realizes its full value and potential. We look forward to witnessing Sony Music Entertainment's exciting future under Sony's ownership.\"</p> <p>Once the transaction is completed, Sony Music Entertainment will include Arista Records, Columbia Records, Epic Records, J Records, Jive Records, RCA Records and Zomba. Key recording artists will include Celine Dion, Alicia Keys, Yo-Yo Ma, Bruce Springsteen, Justin Timberlake, Usher and Jay Chou.</p>",
  "<p>The news that media interest in Israel is on the wane was devoured gleefully by Jerusalem Post readers over the weekend. Under the banner \"<a href=\"http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1215331162392&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull\">Nothing to see here folks</a>\", the paper reported that foreign media were pulling their journalists from the country in droves and replacing them with local stringers, apparently as a result of the decrease in \"spectacular\" violence over the last few years. </p> <p>Simon McGregor-Wood, Jerusalem bureau chief of ABC News, told the paper:</p> <blockquote> <p>The principle is that there is less to report here than there was several years ago ... There are less momentous events. There's a decrease in the violence, and the position changes [in local politics] are not presentable. The daily conflict between Israel and the Palestinians doesn't change much and becomes repetitive and boring. It's been over-covered.</p> </blockquote> <p>This was music to the ears of Post readers, whose comments on the website reflected their delight at the situation. Foreign correspondents (or, as one poster preferred, \"biased leftist pro-Arab loonies\") were not welcome on these shores, it seemed, with readers insisting that they should ply their trade elsewhere, since \"far worse things are happening \u2026 in a great many countries other than Israel\". </p> <p>The central theme of the smug responses was that the world's media hate Israel, and that therefore no news was good news indeed. However, one triumphant poster's comment should actually have set alarm bells ringing amongst his fellow readers, since he astutely predicted what lay around the corner if the Palestinians feel that their plight is being ignored once more. </p> <p>\"<a href=\"http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost%2FJPTalkback%2FCommonFrame&amp;tbId=1210075848953&amp;tbNum=2&amp;type=Show\">Good riddance</a>\", he wrote. \"Though it won't take long for the Arabs to drum up something to get their attention\"; which \u2013 ignoring the sneering generalisation of \"Arabs\" in place of \"Palestinian militants\" \u2013 is by no means an unlikely scenario in the near future. </p> <p>If the reason for the international press corps' departure is the lack of blood and guts, then the one thing sure to put the Palestinians' cause back on centre stage is a return to the years of indiscriminate attacks on Israeli civilians. Life is still as intolerable as ever for the Palestinians, so it will hardly be surprising if there are those amongst their camp who decide a resumption of suicide bombings can't make things any worse, and will at least engender more coverage of their suffering. </p> <p>Of late, Israel's actions in the occupied territories have incorporated a more sophisticated, media-savvy approach, which is no less malicious in intent, but avoids outraged press reaction thanks to the less bloody way in which the occupation is enforced. I was alerted to this a few months ago, when following the story of the IDF's targeting of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/may/01/hebronorphanage\">ICS orphanage</a> in the Palestinian portion of Hebron.</p> <p>The threatened closure of the orphanage and its affiliate buildings was a new strategy intended to slip below the radar of the world's media, said one activist to whom I spoke, thanks to the non-violent tactics employed by the IDF in their pursuit of Hamas. \"Raiding a bakery or a warehouse isn't a hot enough story for most papers to cover\", she commented. \"Even when they burst into the sewing workshop the other night, we found it incredibly hard to get the media interested \u2013 one journalist asked 'are they bombing the place?', as though only bloodshed would warrant coming out in the middle of the night.\" </p> <p>That Israel has discovered a way to carry on making life just as hard for the Palestinians under its control, whilst reducing the amount of interest shown by foreign media, should not under any circumstances be treated as a victory. The underlying tension between the Palestinians and their Israeli oppressors is still there, and growing with every passing day, and the world media's waning interest in the conflict adds a dangerous new ingredient to the mix. </p> <p>The squeaky wheel gets the grease, and the Palestinian militants know this as much as any other freedom fighters around the globe. The fickle nature of news coverage, which is driven by suicide bombs as much as it is by sex and salaciousness, means that there is only one tried and tested method to get the Palestinians' predicament back on the front pages. </p> <p>The olive trees are still falling to make way for the security wall, and just because there is no one from the world media around to hear does not mean it makes no impact on the Palestinian people. Similarly, the day to day effects of the all-encompassing occupation are no less severely felt just because the international press is packing up its cameras and decamping to other hotspots around the world. </p> <p>What would truly be in the best interests of Israelis' security is for the focus of the international media to continue at the pace of previous years, since by doing so it would help keep a lid on the militants' cauldron and prevent it bubbling over out of frustration at their cause being ignored. If this doesn't happen, then no one should be surprised if the dam bursts once more, and the clock is rewound to the bloody beginning of the second intifada.</p>",
  "<p>Climate change protesters today accused police of conducting a smear campaign after officers said they had recovered knives and makeshift weapons during searches of the protest camp at Kingsnorth power station in Kent.</p> <p>Police said the confiscated items \"strongly indicated\" that a hardcore group of protesters intended to break the law. Gary Beautridge, the assistant chief constable of Kent police, said that while most of the people at the camp were peaceful, it was \"clear\" a minority intended to use the equipment for \"criminal purposes\". </p> <p>The weapons, which officers said included an adapted knife, a knife block containing knives and a large chain with a padlock, had been found in woods near the camp. \"There is no justification whatsoever for having these weapons,\" Beautridge said in a statement. </p> <p>\"I would suggest that a minority of people had hidden them with the intention of causing harm to police officers, and possibly to the horses or dogs we are using on patrol.\"</p> <p>Camp organisers reacted angrily to the claims, condemning the statement as \"an irresponsible stunt\" intended to deter people from attending the camp. </p> <p>\"To link a stash of knives allegedly found somewhere in the Hoo peninsula [in Kent] to the Camp for Climate Action is nothing but a smear campaign against us,\" said Ester Davies, one of the camp organisers.</p> <p>\"To suggest that the campers - environmentalists living at a camp serving only vegan food - would even consider hurting a police horse shows the police's press release to be nothing but political policing.\"</p> <p>Other equipment seized since the camp began on Thursday included bolt croppers, climbing ropes and padded suits, which police said suggested that protesters were intending to break into the power station. </p> <p>Isabelle Michel, another camper, said demonstrators had not made any secret of the fact that they intended to take direct action at the power plant. \"This in no way justifies the way the police are treating the camp,\" she said. \"It is disgraceful to suggest that the campers have criminal intent. </p> <p>\"This is obviously an attempt by the police to distract us from raising issues about climate change.\"</p> <p>Organisers have urged MPs Bob Marshall-Andrews and Colin Challen and MEPs Caroline Lucas and Chris Davies, who have already written to Beautridge to complain about his policing of the event, to investigate the latest claims. </p> <p>Demonstrators and police have been involved in repeated standoffs since the camp opened. Protesters have accused police of being heavy-handed, while officers said they were forced to use riot shields in clashes yesterday.</p> <p>Beautridge defended the police's actions in entering the camp to remove obstacles to two access points, saying officers \"will not compromise on safety\". </p> <p>Campaigners are protesting against proposals by the plant's owners, Eon, for a coal-fired facility - the first such plant to be built in Britain for over 30 years. More than 1,000 protesters are expected to try to shut down the power station in a planned day of mass action on Saturday.<br> Twelve people were arrested yesterday. Seven have been charged with offences including possessing a blade, driving without insurance and obstructing and resisting a police officer.</p>",

  "<h2>Fight fat with healthy food</h2> <p>I read with fascination Victoria Macdonald's comment about solutions to our obesity crisis (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/jul/30/obesity\">Effective solutions to obesity appear to be junked</a>). Whilst our politicians busy themselves perfecting their ideological perspectives on the nation's obesity crisis they have yet to actually make any resounding difference. </p> <p>At the heart of this debate is the simple truth \u2013 we all need to maintain a sensible and healthy weight in order to lead a decent quality of life, free as far as possible from ailments and disabilities. So this isn't just about those who are obese, our weight is an issue for all of us. </p> <p>Overweight people (not just obese people) are at high risk of experiencing a hugely impaired quality of life for most of their lives. Eighty per cent of people are overweight when they are diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes and we are about to see the first generation of children who will live shorter lives than their parents because they are overweight. </p> <p>Thirty years ago Type 2 diabetes was unheard of in children; today we have at least 1,400 children diagnosed with the condition in the UK, some as young as seven. </p> <p>Type 2 diabetes causes life-shattering complications such as heart disease, stroke, blindness, kidney damage and amputation. Figures recently released by Diabetes UK show that by 2025 there will be more than four million people with diabetes in the UK. Surely this isn't an acceptable state of the nation's health.</p> <p>Macdonald quite rightly highlights the perverse strength of manufacturers of junk food and we firmly support the banning of junk food advertising. Type 2 diabetes is more prevalent in socially deprived areas, and it is people in these areas who need to be provided with inexpensive alternatives to junk food. Banning junk food advertising before the watershed would be an important symbolic measure to show that as a society we prioritise the health of our children. </p> <p>However, finding a way to make healthy food affordable with rising food prices is now another challenge, and one which politicians should get to grips with if we're not to further the gap in health inequalities.<br><strong>Saranjit Sihota,</strong> head of public policy, Diabetes UK</p> <h2>Sex work shouldn't be a crime</h2> <p>I would like to take issue with Vernon Coaker's comments (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/jul/29/interview.vernoncoaker\">A huge job for the boys</a>) suggesting the public may be willing to accept legislation that will criminalise the clients of prostitutes because they increasingly see prostitution as violence against women.</p> <p>As a sex worker for 10 years and a member of the IUSW (International union of sex workers) I would suggest that the vast majority of the public do not understand the human rights implications that the targeting of clients of sex workers involved in consensual sex would be. </p> <p>There has been no consultation involving the public to my knowledge. There have been many opinion polls that suggest that the general public support legalisation and many comments responding to the media coverage of prostitution that I have read suggest that the public is not in favour of further criminalisation of the industry.</p> <p>The media and government interest in a particular understanding of feminism that equates sex work with violence to women is not representative of the feminist movement and the statistics used by its exponents are suspect and contested by many independent researchers. </p> <p>The vast majority of sex workers make a choice and consent to sex work and that choice should be respected and their human rights respected and protected by the law. The demonisation and victimisation of clients suggested in the article negates any understanding either of the consensual role played by sex workers in society or any understanding of the often complex and diverse needs of clients. </p> <p>As a sex worker I particularly specialised in meeting the needs of elderly and disabled clients. Any law that would drag a disabled man into court and force myself to give evidence of my consensual sex with that man albeit for payment is not, I would suggest, a good law; but this will be the result.</p> <p>Why is the government not looking at New Zealand, where the laws around sex work have been decriminalised very successfully? Recognising the human rights of consensual sex workers is the way forward. Empowering sex workers would enlist the support of sex workers in the fight against trafficking and other abuses in the industry. It would also be a recognition that the abuse that occurs within the industry is often encouraged by the criminalisation of the industry. Criminals after all do not want decriminalisation because that denies them an exploitable market. </p> <p>If Julie Bindel and colleagues would understand that by calling for further criminalisation they are empowering the criminals we would perhaps have a real debate about sex workers rights and an understanding of the positive role sex work plays in our society and then work to end the abuses encouraged by criminal laws based on moral rather than human rights agenda.<br><strong>Douglas Fox,</strong> Newcastle-Upon Tyne</p> <h2>Crime in the limelight</h2> <p>Duncan Campbell argues that modern-day major league criminals are keen to keep out of the public eye, rather than be feted as celebrities as the Krays were (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/jul/30/biography.billyhill\">When crime grabbed the limelight</a>). Perhaps. But some - the corporate criminals from Robert Maxwell on - have been very keen to get publicity and that has often been their downfall. Admittedly it is far more likely to happen in the US than in the UK.<br><strong>Keith Flett,</strong> London</p> <h2>Sister act</h2> <p>Southall Black Sisters' court victory (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/jul/30/localgovernment.equality\">Single-minded pursuit</a>, July 30) is a warning that until we have equality we will not have social cohesion, that in effect the Commission on Integration &amp; Cohesion is putting the cart before the horse, and that we will not have social cohesion unless we respect cultural differences. I do not think Ealing council comes out of this particularly well. Local authorities have to balance the books according to government funding and dictat, but more local authorities should be prepared to challenge the government before it ends up in court. A policy, which on the face of it treats everyone equal, can also be so inflexible that it is discriminatory and unequal. <br><strong>Dr Graham Ullathorne,</strong> Chesterfield</p>",

It was designed to encourage Shia fighters to lay down their guns and take up politics, but in the end it dealt a \"huge blow\" to Britain's reputation.</p> <p>The deal infuriated the Iraqi prime minister, Nouri al-Maliki, and meant US soldiers had to be rushed in to fill the void.</p> <p>Deborah Haynes, the Times' Baghdad correspondent, writes: <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/iraq/article4461067.ece\">\"The arrangement was not dissimilar to the agreement struck between the US military and Sunni Muslim insurgents in central Iraq</a>. </p> <p>\"The difference was that the British had effectively surrendered control of the city.\" </p> <p>Still, as Michael Evans, the paper's defence editor, notes, <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/iraq/article4461036.ece\">no one denies that Basra is now a safer place</a>. </p> <p>Evans says Jack Keane, a retired US commander who backed the American troop surge, acknowledges the will of the allegedly Iranian-backed Shia militia in Basra has been broken.</p> <p>Ministry of Defence officials have denied any secret deal that prevented UK forces from taking part in a major offensive, calling today's report \"absolute rubbish\".</p> <p>The Bush administration makes a point of keeping graphic pictures of its war wounded from Iraq and Afghanistan out of the media. </p> <p>So it went to great lengths to censor a book by the US army called War Surgery in Afghanistan and Iraq: A Series of Cases, which included pictures of shredded limbs, burned faces and profusely bleeding wounds. </p> <p>\"I'm ashamed to say that there were folks, even in the medical department, who said: 'Over my dead body will American civilians see this,'\" Dr David Lounsbury, one of the book's three authors, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/05/health/05surg.html?8dpc\">told the New York Times</a>.</p> <p>The book - a guide to new techniques for US battlefield surgeons - has appeared, but is difficult to find.

  "<video data-media-id=\"gu-video-336227066\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\">  </video>   <p>Jacob Zuma, the African National Congress leader, will have to wait until next month to find out whether corruption charges against him will be dropped after a judge in South Africa today reserved his judgment. </p> <p>Zuma, who is likely to succeed Thabo Mbeki as president next year, is accused of racketeering, corruption, money-laundering and fraud. He has asked the high court in Maritzburg, KwaZulu Natal, to dismiss the charges, which are part an investigation into wider bribery allegations surrounding the country's biggest arms deal in 1999.</p> <p>The hearing had been expected to end today, but the judge, Chris Nicholson, said he was \"minded to give judgment in about a month's time on the 12th of September\".</p> <p>The delay comes amid rising political tensions in South Africa's hard-won democracy. A bitter rift has opened between Mbeki and Zuma, whose supporters accuse Mbeki and the country's judiciary of pursuing a political prosecution.</p> <p>Zuma's lawyers yesterday argued that the prosecution was illegitimate as it reversed an earlier decision by a chief prosecutor in 2003 not to pursue the case. </p> <p>The prosecuting lawyer, Wim Trengove, today said some of the objections made on Zuma's behalf were \"scurrilous and irrelevant\" and \"apparently for public consumption with no bearing on the case\".</p> <p>Senior ANC figures packed court benches and a large crowd of supporters demonstrated outside for a second day, accompanied again by the anti-apartheid song Bring Me My Machine Gun, which has become a Zuma anthem. </p> <p>Pierre Moynot, head of the South African arm of Thint, a French weapons manufacturer, is charged with bribing Zuma. Zuma's former financial adviser Schabir Shaik is serving a 15-year prison sentence for securing bribes on Zuma's behalf. The judge in that case said there was \"overwhelming evidence\" of a corrupt relationship between Shaik and Zuma. The case led Mbeki to sack Zuma as deputy president in 2005.</p> <p>If Nicholson decides to let the case go ahead, Zuma could face trial later this year - leaving South Africa in a legal and political quandrary, because proceedings would be unlikely to end before elections next year that are certain to be won by the ANC. As ANC leader, Zuma is expected to become president.</p>",
  "<p>The government today announced a new crackdown on rogue employers who abused vulnerable workers, aimed at cleaning up the \"dark corners\" of the labour market. </p> <p>An information campaign will be launched to raise awareness of employment rights, and workers will be able to call a special helpline to report mistreatment or illegal pay rates.</p> <p>Unions welcomed the move, but expressed disappointment that coverage of the Gangmasters' Licensing Authority was not being extended to sectors such as construction, care and hospitality. </p> <p>A new Fair Employment Enforcement Board will coordinate the work of agencies that check that firms paid the minimum wage as well as those with responsibility for health and safety, employment and gangmasters, it was announced. </p> <p>Pat McFadden, the employment relations minister, who chaired a forum on vulnerable workers, said: \"Compared to a decade ago there are 3 million more people in work in Britain and they all enjoy more employment rights than they would have in the past. Important minimum standards on wages, paid leave, maternity leave and conditions have been put in place. </p> <p>\"However, as the forum found, there are still dark corners of the labour market where rogue employers seek to mistreat their workers and more needs to be done to safeguard people's rights. </p> <p>\"We want to prevent unscrupulous employers who undercut honest competition and prey on people who are fearful or so desperate to earn a living that they are open to exploitation. </p> <p>\"It is vital we boost awareness of employment rights and ensure those rights are properly enforced. There should be no hiding place for employers who exploit vulnerable workers and who are not prepared to obey the law. </p> <p>\"This is in the interests of workers themselves and, as was made clear by business representatives on the forum, it is in the interests of the reputable businesses who treat their workers fairly and obey the law.\" </p> <p>The forum found that vulnerable workers had a low awareness of their employment rights, while separate helplines operated by different enforcement bodies had caused problems. </p> <p>Brendan Barber, the general secretary of the TUC, said: \"An opportunity has been missed to address the legal and regulatory flaws which keep 2 million workers in conditions which shame a modern economy. </p> <p>\"With new EU moves on agency working and working time and changes on migrant domestic worker visas, these are worthwhile changes won by union campaigning that will make a real difference to many vulnerable workers whose employers are breaking employment law. </p> <p>\"But there are also gaps. It is disappointing that ministers are not prepared to extend the coverage of the Gangmasters' Licensing Authority [GLA] to other vulnerable sectors such as construction, care and hospitality. </p> <p>\"Nor has the government been prepared to examine the legal loophole that deprives many workers from gaining the legal status of an employee, which stops their entitlement to many rights and allows an employer to sack them with no comeback if they attempt to enforce the limited rights they enjoy.\"</p> <p>The building workers' union Ucatt also expressed disappointment that the GLA was not being extended to the construction sector. </p> <p>National officer Jim Kennedy said: \"I am at a loss to understand the opposition to the licensing of gangmasters in the construction industry. We have produced a wealth of data that highlighted the endemic abuse of vulnerable workers by gangmasters in our industrial sector.\" </p> <p>McFadden responded: \"The report is entirely consistent with what Labour said at the National Policy Forum. In both cases, we do not propose to extend licensing to the construction sector, but of course we will continue to look at the evidence in the future.\"</p> <p>Kevin Green, the chief executive of the Recruitment and Employment Confederation said that his organisation had \"long campaigned for better enforcement which is in the interests of law-abiding businesses as well as potentially vulnerable workers. </p> <p>\"There is extensive regulation on the employment agency sector, but these rules mean nothing if they are not effectively enforced. </p> <p>\"These proposals will help tackle the minority of cases where the rights of workers are not respected.\"</p>",
  "<p>Labour MSP Tom McCabe's call for Labour in Scotland to be <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/scotland/article4460887.ece \">independent of London</a> \u2013 or, as he put it, to have \"complete control\", to turn it into \"Scottish Labour\" with \"No ifs, buts or maybes,\" has certainly won him full attention in Scotland \u2013 and created a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stramash\">stramash</a> north of the border to match Labour's spectacular turmoil at Westminster. </p> <p>Many feel that Tom McCabe has come up with some astute thinking that challenges the widely-shared perceptions of \"rudderless Labour\". Hopefully an endorsement from an SNP MP, such as myself, will put paid to any other initiatives designed to get Labour out of its self-created doldrums. </p> <p>McCabe is certainly right. It is amusing that his call for more independence has had to be rebranded as \"complete control\" so as not to frighten the cave-dwellers that he currently has to deal with in his party's tumultuous Westminster faction. This antipathy goes both ways; some Scottish Labour MPs describe their MSP colleagues as \"numpties\" in private, while exhibiting a real deathwish by looking for ways to stop the Scottish parliament getting the cash due to it through the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnett_Formula\">Barnett Formula</a>, thus ultimately depriving their own constituents.</p> <p>However, McCabe is only mirroring what much of the rest of Scottish society feels. Although his official position is to be against Scottish independence, he does want his own section of interest, namely the Labour party, to be as free of London interference as possible. Lots of areas of Scottish society want to have the decision-making that affects their lives to happen as close to them as practically possible, by having more and more powers moved from London to Edinburgh. </p> <p>Due to current realities, McCabe will get nowhere in his attempt to push Labour to a more sensible position. Perhaps he is ahead of his time. If, as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/polls\">polls</a> suggest, Labour loses the next UK election, Labour in Scotland will eventually be doing what McCabe suggests anyway. </p> <p>Labour MSPs will find themselves trying to join the SNP in highlighting misgovernance from Westminster, although having criticised the SNP since 2007 for doing exactly that, they will look like partisan opportunists if or when that day dawns. Meantime they will dither; it's what Labour is good at.</p> <p>Labour in Scotland has three fundamental problems as I see it. Firstly through its scare stories it has misled the public over many years about the SNP. Now as the Scottish public are dealing with an SNP government (which, by and large, it prefers) it leaves Labour with credibility problems.</p> <p>Secondly, Labour is hamstrung by being unable to contemplate anything happening in Scotland without deferring to London. This manifests itself in the belief that further devolution is bad, as it means less London involvement. Labour then, to its political detriment, carries this into its own party structures. As a result the party has isolated itself from the position a more self-confident Scottish society is adopting in relation to the rest of the world.</p> <p>Thirdly, time is not on Labour's side. Parliamentary politics being a zero sum game, the Lib Dems and their largely-ignored Holyrood <a href=\"http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/politics/Inside-Holyrood--Election-that.4353073.jp\">leadership race</a> perhaps hold many of the cards which could further accelerate the demise of Labour in Scotland.</p> <p>The Lib Dems can carry on their own \"no-truck-with-the-SNP\" huff by electing Tavish Scott MSP as leader and face the consequences at next election, or catch up with the Scottish people by choosing Mike Rumbles MSP. Because of its own stubbornness, Labour's fate depends on this contest. The SNP is likely to fulfil expectations and win the byelection when <a href=\"http://news.scotsman.com/politics/McConnell-under-pressure-to-quit.4327566.jp\">Jack McConnell</a> goes. But if the Lib Dems make a choice which will move the constitutional debate forward, they will also do well, and Labour will be finished.</p> <p>Ultimately their own fictions, a love of London rule and time, may mean that <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/leading-articles/leading-article-labours-glasgow-east-defeat-is-a-portent-of-worse-to-come-877809.html\">Glasgow East</a> was not an earthquake but more like the meteor strike that finished off the dinosaurs. Most of Labour in Scotland's thinking has fossilised; the question is, will the party follow? Fortunately for national progress, experience suggests their arrogance will lead them to believe they are immortal.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Warning: this article discusses The Dark Knight and contains plot spoilers. Don't read on if you plan to see the film.</strong></p> <p>The Dark Knight <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/movies/2008/08/01/2008-08-01_dark_knight_sailing_into_titanic_box_off.html\">broke the box office records</a> two weekends running to become this summer's <a href=\"http://www.getthebigpicture.net/blog/2008/7/23/the-dark-knight-fastest-movie-ever-to-200-million.html\">biggest blockbuster</a>. Moviegoers came out to see the second installment of the current Batman franchise - starring Christian Bale as Batman and the late, lamented <a href=\"http://www.guprod.gnl/film/2008/jul/02/features.culture1\">Heath Ledger</a> as the clown prince of crime. Expectations varied wildly - but I'll bet a two-headed coin nobody went into the movie theatre expecting a filmic brief for hypocrisy.</p> <p>That's what they got. There are two kinds of hypocrites: those who pretend to be better than they are for the sake of appearances, and those who pretend to be worse in order to accomplish good ends. The movie shows why both are necessary, and why anti-hypocrites are often villainous.</p> <p>This installment presents Batman as a vigilante who is deeply conflicted about the role he plays. He muses about a time when he will no longer have to put on mask and cape and spend most evenings beating some fear into Gotham City's criminals.</p> <p>When others try to imitate the caped crusader, he orders these wannabes to knock it off, and even leaves them tied up for the cops. One imitator asks what gives him the right to fight crime while telling them to stand down. Batman unhelpfully explains in his sandpapery voice: \"I don't wear hockey pants!\"</p> <p>The thing slowing down his retirement plans is the noticeable effect that his vigilantism is having on crime. When many of the city's crime bosses have a sit-down, the Joker points out that they're meeting during the day for fear of You Know Who. (Of course, during the day, Batman is billionaire and fake playboy Bruce Wayne. He disguises any sunlit heroics with caddish, amusing explanations.)</p> <p>Batman thinks he might have a way out: a replacement. This time it won't be a freelancer who takes the law into his own hands but rather a crusading district attorney. Batman looks to fearless DA Harvey Dent (played by Aaron Eckhart) as the \"White Knight\" who will finally make the city's \"Dark Knight\" irrelevant.</p> <p>Dent's aggressive prosecution of organized crime could finally succeed in cleaning up Gotham to the point where Batman taking the law into his gloves is no longer necessary. One case, filed under <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racketeer_Influenced_and_Corrupt_Organizations_Act\">federal RICO racketeering statutes</a>, promises to take thousands of made men off the streets and take away from the mob the means to buy off cops.</p> <p>Batman goes to great lengths to help Dent secure a key witness and then tries to protect the DA against the Joker's attacks.</p> <p>It's not just Dent's person that Batman wants to protect. When he finds the DA threatening a criminal to get information, he warns the prosecutor that if this ever got out, it would jeopardize everything that he has accomplished. Dent should leave beating information out of criminals to trained vigilantes.</p> <p>When Dent is burned badly, turns into a deranged killer, and dies, Batman insists on being framed for the dead man's murders. Why? So that the city can remember its White Knight without any blemishes. This is very much a \"print the legend\" movie.</p> <p>And let's not forget the Joker. He's a criminal mastermind who is not interested in money. Rather, he has something to prove. He wants to destroy things to show just how rotten people really are - to strip men of their polite contradictions and turn them into killers like himself. He succeeds with Dent and tries to convince even Batman that what he's doing is futile.</p> <p>To that end, he sets up his biggest prank. Two barges are hijacked and booby trapped and the passengers on each barge are given a trigger that will blow the other up and told that if they don't press the button by midnight, they'll both go up in flames.</p> <p>It's an inversion of the old game theorist tool, the <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/prisoner-dilemma/\">Prisoner's Dilemma</a>. One of the barges is literally packed with violent prisoners and the other with peaceable Gothamites trying to flee the Joker's destruction. Either the murderers can act according to script or the relative innocents can become murderers to save themselves.</p> <p>Normally we believe it's better to side with truth seekers and against hypocrites. But The Dark Knight succeeds in overturning that presumption. Every time Batman battles the Joker, sensible people are rooting for the hypocrite.</p>",
  "<p>I had no idea, when I went online to make my first blog post just six years ago, how proud I would come to feel about being a blogger. Initially, I didn't even tell old friends and family my blog address (<a href=\"http://www.isaacmao.com\">isaacmao.com</a>). The reason was that I was afraid to come across as sticking my neck out to be very different from the mainstream: traditionally in Chinese culture, it's better to keep new ventures low-key to avoid losing face if they fail.</p> <p>That first post, on August 5 2002, was little more than a simple announcement saying \"From today, I'm stepping into the blogosphere\". What then happened was impossible to imagine: just like in a fairy story, you planted some seeds and woke up one morning to find they had grown into a forest.</p> <p>In the case of my initial blogging, I think of it as <em>huozhong</em>, a \"seed fire\", which soon attracted other new bloggers. Zheng, a vocational school teacher in a remote city in Fujian province, found my blog while looking around on Google and sent a comment saying he too was interested in this new format where people could set up personal web logs and write about anything that interested them. </p> <h2>Bloggers' handbook</h2> <p>Chatting online, we became friends, and discovered we were both interested in compiling an online handbook to introduce blogging to more Chinese people. That simple idea got us working together to create a group blog site for the purpose - which is how cnblog.org was born. </p> <p>We subtitled the site \"Blog on Blog\" and we blogged every day to show people in China how easy it was to create their own blog and use it for writing or exchanging information about almost anything: starting a new career, pregnancy and childbearing, preparing a thesis, and so forth.</p> <p>Things went faster than we imagined. The group blog site collected more than 50 guest bloggers from all over the country to talk about the changes that could be brought about by forms of personal publishing in our particular society. </p> <p>Observing developments in China's blogosphere and talking about blogging became an important part of my blog content. By the end of 2002, there were more than a thousand bloggers in China, and at cnblog.org we knew almost every one of them. </p> <h2>Word of mouth</h2> <p>By the end of 2007, there were 47 million bloggers in China, the whole blogosphere having expanded itself exponentially by what you could call online word of mouth. Now China may well be, in absolute numbers, the largest blogging country in the world (while having the second largest population of internet users, at 160 million, according to the quasi-official China Internet Network Information Center, after the United States at 190 million).</p> <p>From that you can picture what an explosion of Chinese bloggers there was during 2003-2007. Whether I was, as people have sometimes said, mainland China's \"first blogger\", is hard to track - though I can't find any other bloggers in Google on that August day when I published my first blog post. What I know is that I feel very lucky to have been the one witnessing the whole process from the very beginning.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336228312\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2008/08/04/isaacmao220.jpg\" alt=\"Chinese blogger Isaac Mao\" width=\"220\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Isaac Mao: pictured at the Guardian's Future of Journalism conference. Photograph: David Levene</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene /Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>During our early debates on the functions of blogging for Chinese society, there were many flame wars online. One IT commentator nicknamed \"Keso\", for instance, published an article in a popular internet community satirising the passion of pioneer bloggers and predicting that the phenomenon would be short-lived, \"just like a fashion show\". </p> <p>Bloggers responded in defence of their format. Interestingly, after a year of contestation, Keso became a blogger too, realising he could publish his ideas better through a blog than via chatrooms or bulletin board systems (BBS). He is now one of the most famous IT bloggers in China.</p> <p>These days, the sheer number of people blogging in China is having an impact in itself. First, many traditional media in China now quote frequently from blogs. Some of them also discover news sources in the blogosphere - otherwise, they risk losing valuable first-hand information. Second, blogs are always linking to each other and weaving a trust-based social media fabric. And as people increasingly use search engines to get important information, these engine-friendly social media are easily discovered by users.</p> <h2>The new individual</h2> <p>At the same time, this shift of media power has transformed many bloggers into a new generation of celebrity in the past six years. China has a long tradition of people trying to fit into the group, moderating their behaviour to avoid standing out conspicuously - a culture reinforced by the man-made collectivism of the past half-century. </p> <p>Blogs have leapfrogged this tradition, acting as a catalyst to encourage young people to become more individual. So this and other grassroots media are now emerging strongly to challenge China's social legacy.</p> <p>Even so, it's not entirely easy to blog freely, especially in a country with media controls like China. In 2005, my blog was blocked because I posted an article relating to the Chinese censorship system - probably the most complicated in the world. </p> <p>This \"<a href=\"http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/digitalcontent/2008/07/the_great_firewall_of_china_ca.html\">Great Firewall</a>\" or \"Kung Fu Net\", as China's internet users call it can effectively block any web pages including keywords considered sensitive by the authorities (such as \"Tian'an Men\", \"Censorship\", etc). </p> <p>If you try to access such a page, the system will return a \"reset\" message and temporarily render the whole site unaccessible. There are also whole sites that are permanently blacklisted, including those of certain human rights groups or dissident blogs. As social problems have emerged in the past six years, the blacklist has become longer and longer.</p> <p>In my blocked blog, I was analysing the technical details of the system. When the system automatically detected this content, my blog was unplugged the next day. I had to suspend blogging for about 80 days, until I moved my site to a host service abroad. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336228313\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2008/08/05/mao.com220.jpg\" alt=\"Isaac Mao's blog\" width=\"220\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Isaac Mao's blog</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But I came to see that this intervention had a lucky side: because it hurt my social capital online, it forced me to rethink some of my everyday assumptions. I became a stronger confronter to any kinds of censorship from then on.</p> <p>Aware nowadays of Great Firewall - which quite matches its physical namesake, a legacy of the First Emperor - there are many Chinese bloggers who now have their blogs hosted overseas to prevent harassment by local authorities. </p> <p>So, albeit in a roundabout way, freedom of speech is being realised in this \"guesting\" way. We hope we can return to host sites in China some day, after our domestic internet businesses reject the compromises of self-censorship.</p> <h2>Letter to Google</h2> <p>Some months ago I wrote an open letter on my blog to the founders of Google, arguing that Google is now losing its fame among the formerly loyal user community in China because it is making compromises with censorship by filtering content considered sensitive or immoral from search results - even going so far as to remove some people's names from its index database. </p> <p>People posted hot comments in response to my letter - some taking issue but most in support. However, there has yet to be a response from Google (or Google China). It did no more than display, six months after the open letter, a message acknowledging that it filtered some results. </p> <p>Such an abuse of technology has angered a number of Chinese bloggers, who see it as a dilution a dilution of the search engine's \"Don't be evil\" motto. This in turn is almost certainly one of the factors behind Google's loss of market share in China, where its use rate accounts for less than 25%, a slide of several percentage points since 2005. <br> A Chinese blogger called \"Zola\" recently posted interesting home-made video clips on YouTube recording his verbal ambush of Google China's president, Lee Kai-Fu, at a local hotel where the executive was participating in a forum on the internet in China. Questioned persistently by Zola on Google's self-censorship policy, Lee cut short his remarks and exited hastily, protected by bodyguards.</p> <p>Unfortunately, I've heard from my international blogger friends that such things are happening everywhere. Episodes like this have made me realise why universal values can't be applied anywhere in the short term (and why a great company can find it hard to become greater). Looking at the experience in my homeland, I also believe the abuses of censorship produce a certain level of social fear - which leads to less creativity.</p> <h2>Online fame</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-336228314\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Media/Pix/pictures/2008/08/05/mao_220.jpg\" alt=\"Isaac Mao\" width=\"220\" height=\"130\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Isaac Mao. Photograph: Martin Godwin/Guardian</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Godwin/Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Just like everywhere, too, I've seen blogs changing people's personal lives in many ways in China. An obvious one is the impact that a blog's fame can have on its originator. Zheng, my first blogger friend who was a teacher in a remote city, now is working as chief operating officer of a social networking website. </p> <p>Serving as chief technology officer in the same business is Bruce Wang, another blogger friend. Various other friends friends have easily found new jobs through their blogging - or even become happy couples. In other words, blogging has brought a higher quality of life to people I know. I sometimes use it to try to solve life problems, or help other friends to solve their problems.</p> <p>So what I've witnessed in these six years is not only the explosion in big numbers of users and media space, but also these individual effects - including in my life. I'm now more like a global citizen than six years ago. </p> <p>International bloggers from different countries became my friends by interacting over blogosphere. It is about trust because when bloggers share their minds they are also sharing the richness of their personal history \u2013 not only past and present, but their expectations too.</p> <p>With such trust and understanding, borders won't be geographical any more. Rebecca MacKinnon, who was CNN's Beijing bureau chief and loved Chinese culture, transformed herself into an independent blogger. We became best friends and share information regularly. We also collaborate on some interesting projects such as Global Voices Online, which she co-founded.</p> <p>Another famous blogger I met in the blogosphere is Joichi Ito, a Japanese-American. We both come from a technical background, and we both belong to the army of people whose blogging has led them into becoming entrepreneurs, working with venture-capital investors looking to back internet start-ups. </p> <p>We exchanged ideas about fostering conversations between young Chinese and Japanese bloggers to reach more understandings over the historical dispute between the two countries. And Carol Lin, who is called \"queen of micro-blogging\" in Taiwan, helps me understand how people with different political backgrounds can understand each other.</p> <p>The blog is such a good conversation tool that I believe it can help enrich people's perception of the world - a medium without the constraints of space and mindset that limit traditional media without being misled by poor few.</p> <h2>Tolerance through blogging</h2> <p>Blogging can also help people to become modest and tolerant - at first, I was easily annoyed by readers' remarks when I thought I was right, but over time I've learned a lot from their comments, which has made me more moderate in reacting to them. </p> <p>An entrepreneur posted some very nasty comments on my blog when I wrote something pointing out design problems with his product. He was very young at that time. Instead of firing back, I just posted further explanations. </p> <p>Hundreds of reader comments supported my post, and eventually, realising he'd been stupid and almost lost a great opportunity to improve his product, the guy apologised to me. He is now running a quite big business in China.</p> <p>I would also say this process has made me more rational, and more inclined to think in depth. It seems to me that the language and qualities of blogging are a kind of \"Modern Chinese\". </p> <p>In the early internet phase, there appeared a lot of bulletin boards and online forums susceptible to being inundated with nationalist diatribes and online \"Dazibao\" [wall posters] by some people lacking independence of thought. Today, I think many Chinese bloggers are transferring themselves into Modern Chinese by continuous inputting and outputting their thoughts online.</p> <p>When I started the blogging journey, I was motivated by a vague belief that it could improve my learning skills. I still think that is true, but perhaps the most charming part of blogging is the power of extending your borders in ways that you didn't plan or intend.</p> <p>Sometimes it's even magical. Blogging about different parts of your life, you can come to know people you never expected to encounter. All the while, reading and writing blog posts expands your knowledge base. </p> <p>Occasionally, artists found me via my blog because they loved some of the scripts I wrote about daily life. Some policemen found me and asked to meet me because they disliked points I was making opposing \"censorship\". And more, I've got to know many entrepreneurs and professionals online through sharing ideas.</p> <h2>The privacy issue</h2> <p>A lot of people are reluctant to become a blogger just because of their concerns about so-called \"privacy\", their worry that \"leaking\" their personal life to the general public will lead to them being annoyed by other people. I had the same concern for a long time. In the early days, I would think of what consequences every blog post might generate before I clicked the \"publish\" button.</p> <p>But now this concern has faded away. Anyone, I've realised, can well control his/her privacy on a blog. The content I share online using my real identity is actually neither private stuff nor public. It is a new space called \"social space\". Of course, the blog can be viewed publicly - but in practice the viewers are those who are interested in my blog and trust me the same way I trust the society.</p> <p>It's a different mindset that one can feel after blogging for a period of time. I call this philosophy \"<a href=\"http://www.picnicnetwork.org/page/18409/en\">Sharism</a>\", and it can be practised by anyone because the rewards are easy to see. You share one piece of knowledge and then could come a time of returns (maybe not immediately, but with many magic happenings in the future). </p> <p>The sharism spirit can currently be found in any so called \"Web 2.0\" phenomena - Wikipedia is just one example, created from the collective intelligence by many people around the world based on their sharing philosophy. </p> <p>In a more metaphysical view, your blog can act as a halo (to borrow a term from gaming) to shine more lights to the world and coupled with other people's halo at the same time. This has spawned more imaginations in my mind of future society where everyone can be sharist and all the brains are well connected to form a smarter society like a social brain - though given the controls and obstacles that still confront blogging, it is going to be a long road to reach the social-brain dream.</p> <p>Meanwhile, I've seen my own blogging evolve in several ways. In my first two years, I was spending more than three hours a day to develop from beginner into a skilled blogger, and seemed totally addicted to blogging. Nowadays, I have redefined my daily timetable to mix more offline life with blogging habits. So I'm not a slave of blogging. I think I enjoy a new lifestyle of being \"both high tech and high touch\". You could call it life 2.0. </p> <p>Along the road I've also set up a range of separate blogs, reflecting different purposes or targeting different audiences. On them, since that first post, I've published 2,300 articles. My next step, however, may be to try to merge them again into one life-log. I'm also managing to post on some group blogs to collaborate on interesting topics. </p> <p>And I'm regularly blogging in non-text formats - pictures, audio/video clips and more fun stuff. Just in this passing year, I got totally addicted to a new type of blogging -Microblogging, which enables me to blog any time with a short piece of ideas or meme (a concept to describe micro ideas). I find it an easier way to share small pieces of ideas with trusted friends and make life-log possible. One of the fancy things about blog is 'permanent' link which is for other people to link back to your post. So I even posted a totally blank post occupying a link. </p> <p>I carry on trying to persuade all sorts of people to start blogging, without insisting they should follow any particular code - everybody has the right to share whatever they want, though I think they should understand how to keep a balance that avoids infringing others. It's a process of finding the \"larger you\" step by step.</p> <p>Today, as a blogger with six years' experience, there's no question of downplaying what I do. I can confidently print my blog address on my name card and tell other people I'm first a blogger, then a businessman. These changes are not just due to the passage of time, but also to the attitude of millions of bloggers in China towards \"the new\" - new ideas, new subjects, and the whole outside world. </p> <p>I'm more likely to share new stuff than six years ago, because I think there are more benefits than risks in sharing. There have been growing pains, but I wish and believe that - for us in China and people everywhere - the blog will eventually become a lifelong partner.</p> <p><em><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediaguardian.co.uk\">editor@mediaguardian.co.uk</a> or phone 020 7239 9857.

  "<p>Men who appear charming one minute and terrifyingly aggressive the next or who pressurise their partner into having sex are showing early warning signs of domestic abuse, according to a campaign launched by Refuge today.</p> <p>The charity, which is the UK's largest single provider of support and accommodation for female victims of domestic violence, said although most women recognised physical abuse, other subtler forms of control, such as telling women what they can wear, aren't recognised as abusive behaviour and can escalate into violence.</p> <p>The organisation also called on the government to do more preventative work by targeting young people in schools.</p> <p>Sandra Horley, the chief executive of Refuge, said: \"It is essential that women receive the right education and information so they understand the techniques of control frequently used by abusive men. It is all too easy for women to excuse their partner's possessive and jealous behaviour- but in doing so they run the risk of the abuse increasing in frequency and severity.</p> <p>\"Once she recognises there's a problem she can do something about it. The government spends very little on education campaigns on what is a major social problem. Domestic violence causes more deaths than cancer. We can provide refuges but we can't stop the problem without education.\"</p> <p>According to the Home Office two women in England and Wales are killed by their partner or ex-partner every week and the most recent British Crime Survey reported around 12.9m incidents of domestic abuse against women.</p> <p>But a spokeswoman for Refuge said the campaign is not only aimed at those in abusive relationships but also women who may need to make informed decisions about future partners. The charity said a slap or a shove could escalate into brutal beating and murder and recognising early signs would save lives.</p> <p>Other warning signs that Refuge said women should look out for are whether a partner is stopping you from seeing family and friends; constantly criticising and putting you down in public; being excessively jealous and possesive; telling you what to wear, who to see, where to go and what to think; controlling your money, and whether you have started walking on eggshells to avoid making him angry.</p> <p>Damaging possessions, threatening to kill pets or threatening to kidnap children if their partner leaves are just some of the scenarios also highlighted by Refuge.</p> <p>A survey by YouGov, commissioned by the charity, found that half of those who took part had experienced at least one of the warning signs, but only a fifth said they would talk to someone about their experiences. </p> <p>Women also want to be better educated about domestic violence issues: 87% said they had received no information about domestic violence at school and wished they had done so.</p> <p>Margaret Moran MP, the chairwoman of the all-party parliamentary group on domestic violence and member of a Home Office select committee on the issue, called for more education in schools. \"In our report we said the government needs to look at more preventative measures in schools. Ed Balls' [the secretary of state for children, schools and families] office has been quite receptive about our findings.\"</p> <p>Moran also welcomed more information on early warning signs. \"What perpetrators do is make women feel like it's their fault and it's often a wearing down over a period of time. Women aren't always aware that there's a pattern, or recognise these problems so anything that alerts women is a good thing, then at least you can be aware and equip yourself,\" she said. </p> <p>\"We need more prevention rather than just picking up the pieces. Research says that it takes on average 35 beatings before a woman seeks help, that's a long way down the road. We need to start long before that.\"</p> <p>A number of celebrities have also joined the campaign including comedian Jo Brand, actor Patrick Stewart and Cherie Booth QC.</p>",
  "<p> Tonightly, presented by Jason Manford, goes out on Channel 4 every weeknight for the next three weeks. Photograph: Channel 4</p> <p>It was, said the man in charge of Channel 4, tremendously exciting, creatively refreshing and an enormous risk for a major TV channel to take. But what did you make of new nightly comedy show, <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/T/tonightly/index.html\">Tonightly?</a></p> <p>Five minutes in, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/jul/28/channel4.television1\">after reading Julian Bellamy's description of Tonightly in MediaGuardian</a>, I had to check the Radio Times to make sure I was watching the right show.</p> <p>On the face of it, Tonightly's mix of topical gags, spoof characters and sketches does not seem entirely ground-breaking and indeed remarkably similar to its Channel 4 predecessor, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwEWMmICtoc\">The 11 O'Clock Show</a>.</p> <p>Not many people liked The 11 O'Clock Show at the time, but it did give us <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwjyQIkW5aA\">Sacha Baron Cohen</a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9M1Bl74lRzU\">Ricky Gervais</a> and, er, Daisy Donovan and Iain Lee.</p> <p>On first viewing, Tonightly is a lot safer than its predecessor, and grindingly familiar. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOhqr4rJmmA&amp;feature=related\">Bloke does gags about news, bloke sits behind desk to introduce female co-host who does... more gags about news.</a></p> <p>Main presenter Jason Manford is an accomplished host, but then he is the veteran among a sea of relative newcomers.</p> <p>You might know Manford from Channel 4's Eight Out of Ten Cats or his show on Xfm in Manchester. He has a couple of nice gags about Barry George and how the world has changed in the seven years he has been inside - \"remember Britney Spears?\" - and his dad who is \"so worried about the price of gas he has started farting into freezer bags\".</p> <p>Manford even looks a tiny bit like Ricky Gervais - no offence - and is the best thing about Tonightly, certainly more assured than his co-host Andi Osho, who regaled us with the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3zyyoH-_fI&amp;feature=related\">hilarious answers kids put on school exam papers</a>. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/H2O-All-That-Martyn-Berry/dp/1870655052/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1217927058&amp;sr=1-3\">My old chemistry teacher</a> was doing this three decades ago. The funny things kids say, eh? Still, early days.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ejMFHg7fBE&amp;feature=related\">The spoof MP tanked</a>, and the comedy investigative report about dangerous vegetables with Steve Lipschitz was very Day Today Lite. Still, as I say, it was only episode one.</p> <p>Another comedy character, TV critic Ollie Roberts, introduced clips of the <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/V/victorian-passions/richard-burton/\">Victorian Sex Explorer</a> (Dickens! Dick-ins! Get it?) and <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/food/on-tv/f-word/\">Gordon Ramsay's F Word</a>, including a very funny gag about shooting a dog. But the truth is the two clips hinted at something far more interesting than Tonightly or any of its 12 credited writers had to offer.</p> <p>Tonightly, which was not exactly announced in a fanfare of publicity by Channel 4, is brought to us by Objective Productions, the independent producer of Peep Show and Star Stories, so it has plenty of pedigree.</p> <p>Whether the new talent on show becomes established in the way of its late-night Channel 4 predecessor, I'm not so sure. But hats off to Channel 4 for trying out a TV comedy show which features neither a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMto9BxRkgs\">panel show</a> element - like BBC1's execrable <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-61w-afIiE\">Would I Lie To You?</a> - or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/jul/28/channel4.television\">Alan Carr</a>.</p> <p><strong>* Tonightly, Channel 4, 11.05pm tonight, and at a similar time for the next three weeks.</strong></p>",
  "<p>Henbane. Do not be tempted to include this in a salad. Photograph: Eric Hosking/Corbis</p> <p>There something about Antony Worrall Thompson that speaks to me. Maybe it's the <a href=\"http://www.thehobbitblog.com/\">hobbit</a>-like demeanour or the voice like an <a href=\"http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=a1Y73sPHKxw\">indignant squirrel</a> that says, 'here is a man in touch with nature, at one with the lore of the trees, a man you could trust in a forest'.</p> <p>Which could, it transpires, be an extremely dangerous assumption since yesterday when AWT, rubicund darling of the menopause set and culinary Shrek, gleefully leapt onto a passing local/seasonal/foraging/save-money-in-a-credit-crunch bandwagon and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/aug/04/foodanddrink.foodsafety\">suggested we should put henbane</a> in our salads.</p> <p>Now I'm guessing, from Ant's nicely rounded vowels that he benefited from at least a very good education, if not an excellent one so it is intriguing to speculate which part of 'henbane' he didn't get. Fair enough, the name isn't quite as much a giveaway as that of its close relative Deadly Nightshade but anyone with an interest in food or ingredients could, surely take a fair guess that anything that was a bane to poultry was unlikely to make a human spring like a flea.</p> <p>Damage control at the <a href=\"http://www.awtonline.co.uk/home.asp#\">AWT nerve centre</a> has, predictably swung into action with a comprehensive, good-humoured apology on national media - apparently Wozza mispoke and was actually referring to '<a href=\"http://www.dgsgardening.btinternet.co.uk/fathen.htm\">fat hen weed</a>' - and an almost unbelievably quick update to the Wikipedia entries on both <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henbane\">herb</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Worrall_Thompson\">cook</a>. I suppose we should expect this, such is the nature of modern celebrity, but part of me is incensed. How dare they try to shut this down before we've finished gloating?</p> <p>Fortunately, as we all know, though everybody watches sleb chefs on the telly, buys their books and hangs upon their every word, precisely nobody can be arsed to get off the sofa to cook their recipes let alone forage in a nearby forest for obscure ingredients. Though this would ordinarily be cause for lament, on this occasion it means nobody has actually perished following yer man's assertion that <em>hyoscyamus niger</em>, aka stinking nightshade, <a href=\"http://www.stephen-stratford.co.uk/dr_crippen.htm\">Dr Crippen's prescription</a> and Juliet's terminal tipple is in fact a \"tasty addition to salads\".</p>",
  "<p>He may well return, of course, but for now it seems fair to ask: how will you remember Michael Vaughan? Winner of the Ashes? Possessor of the next-best cover-drive after God? Owner of a dodgy knee? Puller of back-of-a-length balls? Captain? Batsman? Enigma?</p> <p>It seems weird just asking the question. As Geoff Miller pointed out yesterday, England might now be leading this series. But South Africa batted two days for a draw at Lord's, chased down 281 at Edgbaston thanks to one of the great fourth-innings knocks by Graeme Smith, and - hey presto - we are talking about Vaughan in the past tense. Suddenly, the Ashes feels like much less than 11 months away.</p> <p>Vaughan himself is hard to place - as batsman and captain. In both cases, he enjoyed a golden spell that glistened all too briefly and left you wondering which bit was the exception and which the rule. With the bat his annus mirabilis stretched from May 2002 to Jan 2003, when he scored over 1,500 runs at an average of 76 and hit seven hundreds, three of them in Australia. As leader, 15 of his 26 Test wins came between March 2004 and August 2005. Much of the rest was anti-climax.</p> <p>When Geoff Boycott was asked on the radio on Sunday afternoon where he placed Vaughan in the pantheon of English captains, his answer sounded ungenerous. Test matches are so frequent these days, he ecky-thumped, that records mean less than they once did. It felt like an unworthy epitaph for the man who won more Tests as England captain than anyone, regained the Ashes after 18 years, and on his day remains the easiest of batsmen on the eye. But - as often with Boycott - there was a kernel of truth behind the bluster.</p> <p>The reality is that 20 of Vaughan's 26 wins came against either Bangladesh (four), New Zealand (six) and West Indies (10). That leaves four against South Africa and two against Australia. Remarkably for a captain regarded as resourceful, he failed to win a single Test out of 11 against India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. It is a gaping hole on his CV.</p> <p>His batting never fitted easily into any one category, despite 18 Test hundreds. He could be glorious (Trent Bridge 2007) and gormless (Bangalore 2001); gritty (Kandy 2003) and gargantuan (Sydney 2003). But, after making twin hundreds against West Indies at Lord's in 2004, he was generally disappointing: 63 Test innings after that brought him only five hundreds and nine fifties. After that tour of Australia he was averaging nearly 51; now the figure is 41, lower than it has been for six years.</p> <p>Vaughan touched greatness in both disciplines (and a genuinely great off-break to Sachin Tendulkar at Trent Bridge in 2002 made you wish his knee allowed him to bowl more) without ever booking in for bed and breakfast. He was, by his own admission, helped by one of the best fast-bowling quartets England ever had, and - in Duncan Fletcher - by a deep-thinking coach he still feels indebted to. Yet he had the guts, the nous, the ambition and the respect to make the most of the tools at his disposal.</p> <p>Can he come again as a batsman? Critics are quick to conclude that his eye has gone, which would be unusual at the age of 33, but not unheard of. If he breaks the habit of a lifetime and scores runs for Yorkshire - who have six four-day games between now and the end of the season - he may yet make it to India and West Indies. And then, who knows? One more crack at Australia from the safer haven of No5, where he could melt more easily into the background and still allow Kevin Pietersen the benefit of his tactical expertise? It's a tempting thought. But for now a heartfelt \"thanks for the memories\" feels like the most appropriate sentiment.</p> <p><em>Extract taken from <a href=\"http://sport.theguardian.com/thespin/0,,806133,00.html\">The Spin</a>, theguardian.com/sport's weekly look at the workld of cricket.

  "<p>The former US president Bill Clinton gave his support to the prime minister today, advising him to use his \"big brain and good heart\" to work through Britain's economic difficulties.</p> <p>Clinton said he was not about to predict Gordon Brown's demise, and it would be \"difficult to maintain a very high level of popularity\" for any politician amid higher living and energy costs. Brown had to \"trust the people\" to \"make a good judgment\" whenever he decided to call a general election.</p> <p>In an interview with the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, Clinton said he had known Brown for 20 years and was still in contact.</p> <p>\"I think anybody would find it difficult to maintain a very high level of popularity when average people are having the problems they are having today in the UK and the US with the soaring price of gasoline and the cost of living going up,\" Clinton said.</p> <p>\"I wouldn't predict Gordon's demise too quickly. I think he is just in a period where circumstances have got the British people appropriately concerned about how to get from day to day, week to week.</p> <p>\"The only advice I would give him is that he has got a big brain and a good heart - he just needs to apply them both to working through these issues as best he can and trust the politics.</p> <p>\"Just trust the people, at whatever time he stands for election, to make a good judgment. You get one of these jobs, the best politics is to do the job.\"</p> <p>Clinton's comments came as he addressed an international Aids conference in Mexico City, where he called for more to be done to hold down the cost of anti-Aids drugs. He said a 50% funding rise was needed in the next two years just to keep pace with expanding drug programmes.</p> <p>Clinton told the conference yesterday that his foundation would focus on fighting Aids in the US, especially in the black population.</p> <p>He said he was spurred to action after the US centres for disease control reported that 40% more Americans had HIV than previously estimated. The report said nearly half of annual HIV infections in the US were among black people.</p> <p>\"For Americans, this should be a wake-up call,\" said Clinton. \"Even as we keep working globally, we need to do much more to fight Aids at home, and I intend to do so with my foundation.\"</p> <p>Clinton flew to Mexico after touring Africa to see the work of the William J Clinton Foundation's HIV/Aids Initiative.</p> <p>The foundation has negotiated agreements to lower the price of rapid HIV tests and anti-Aids drugs in the developing world, and has collaborated with the Geneva-based Unitaid, a UN-backed fund that helps supply low-cost antiretroviral drugs.</p>",
  "<p>\"More with less.\" Uttered in the proud tones of a man who believes he's coined a powerful maxim, the executive editor of the Baltimore Sun, James C Whiting III, gives us this episode's key phrase. He's announcing a new round of redundancies as he does so, and it sums up, in three words, the grand trends sweeping across not just the Sun but City Hall and an increasingly beleaguered police force. </p> <p>This being the Wire, though, in some places the inverse applies; less with more. McNutty, who's turned to concocting murders at a heady rate, is unable to drum up interest in his non-existent serial killer. Alma Gutierrez, the young hack whose reporting on the Junebug case is the result of assiduous street-pounding, sees her story reduced to 12 inches below the fold. Even Marlo is impaired, unable to make the Greeks take him seriously no matter how many briefcases of cash he gifts them.</p> <p>Ambiguity has always been part of the Wire's attraction and it's a relief to find that while the show is hoisting up perhaps its most simplistic slogan yet, not everything conforms to the rule.</p> <p>Take the relationship between Gus Haynes and Scott Templeton. Gus, as city editor, is the archetype of the journalist that David Simon and Ed Burns are mourning throughout this season. Hard working, inspirational and true to the traditions of his trade, getting more from less is anathema to him. Scott, meanwhile, is all colour no facts, a fancy writer who'd rather not get his hands dirty, and cheap to boot.</p> <p>It seems almost certain that in this episode Templeton crosses the line from embellishing his copy to actually making it up. Last week he interviewed a paraplegic baseball fan who loved the Orioles but didn't like giving his name, address or any other distinguishing details about himself. This week we watch Scott choose not to pick up the phone, and instead type frantically before passing Gus a killer quote on Commissioner Burrell's job prospects. (At the same time as Gutierrez is taking a call from a police source anxious to spread the word about a serial killer on the loose\u2026) </p> <p>The quote is off the record and Gus immediately calls Scott on it. We watch as he is questioned and his face betrays not a sign of guilt. It becomes clear that he is happy to lie to Gus, the editor who has no faith in him, who would rather chase dull stories about institutional funding than those with human interest, who ironically calls experienced reporters \"dead wood\" in Scott's company to show where his affections lie. Scott may not be a journalist in the mould Simon and Burns admire, but he is still given his own animus.</p> <p>Just as Gus is not quite the flawless knight, we see this week that Marlo is not quite the invincible villain. His pursuit of Vondas and the Greek is typically forthright and persistent, but for the first time he is left befuddled as a tribute of money is dismissed out of hand.</p> <p>\"It stinks. It's from the street,\" says Vondas. \"It's dirty money. Everything runs through Prop Joe. Everything from Prop Joe is \u2026 clean.\"</p> <p>The message Marlo takes from this encounter is not \u2013 as one suspects Vondas means \u2013 to act more like a businessman and less like a soldier. The message he takes is to go and find actual clean money, bills with no stains or creases on them. It's naivety on the part of a young man whose only life experience is that of a murderous gangster, and it happens again when Prop Joe assures him he can go online to check the balance of his new offshore bank account. \"On a computer?\" asks Marlo, just checking what the internet is.</p> <p>Not that there's too much of Marlo's na\u00efve side on show, as there's not a lot to see. Perhaps a similar fate to that of Stringer Bell would befall him were he to go legit, but at the same time as he's talking fund transfers with Prop Joe, he's dispatching Snoop and Chris to hunt down Omar.</p> <p>Duplicitious creep, and Prop's idiot nephew, Cheese, rats out on Butchie, Omar's blind bar-running mentor. And before you know it Snoop and Chris have staked him out, killed his crew, tied him up, tortured him and, finally, shot him dead by way of summoning their prey.</p> <p>And so, the final scene of the programme speeds us to a shabby Mexican village on the shores of the sea, Omar's new home. He emerges, padding across the beach feeding the local kids, who are poor but seem keener on sweets than heroin. A scooter arrives and Omar is told about Butchie. There's no anger on his face, just sadness. But you know the game is afoot once again.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Discuss the episode on <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/organgrinder/2008/08/the_wire_season_five_episode_t_1.html\">Steve Busfield's blog</a></p>",
  "<p>Barry George is a weirdo \u2013 that's okay, I can say it, as it formed a key part of the successful defence in his retrial for the murder of Jill Dando. Unintelligent, a fantasist, a braggart, something of a sex pest too and not subtle about it \u2013 no one seems to have ever denied this. Yet apparently, for eight years, the Metropolitan Police also believed he was something of a criminal mastermind. <br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jul/14/september11.usa\">Charlie Brooker</a> gleefully and confidently assaults 9/11 \"troofers\" in his record-breaking Cif thread, but the core arguments against conspiracies in most high-profile cases \u2013 9/11, JFK, Oklahoma City - work against a lone nut theory in the Jill Dando killing, and always did. <br> The police are playing their usual game right now \u2013 hinting they're not considering any other suspects, revealing convictions and suspicions that were not put in front of the jury \u2013 suggesting with nods and winks that, regardless of the verdict, they know who did the deed. Their misplaced confidence was absurd from day one. There is not one chance in a billion that Barry George killed Jill Dando, and the Met must always have known this. I'll focus on just one aspect of the crime, but it's enough to prove the fragility of the overall police case. From the moment a brass cartridge case that once held the bullet that killed Dando was found, it was certain that whoever killed her was either a gunsmith himself, or had access to specialist weapons-making facilities \u2013 and it was a strong possibility that the killer hailed from Eastern Europe. The cartridge, a Remmington .380 casing, had been opened, and propellant removed to reduce the crack of a gunshot \u2013 then crimped back onto the slug, a 9mm round, creating a custom-built, low-powered, composite round. An old <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NKVD\">NKVD</a> trick apparently, dating from Stalin's days. This simple fact instantly ruled out someone like George acting alone. He could not have prepared the ammunition himself, at no stage were the police able to link him to any facilities where he may have been able to do it, they were never able to connect him to a illegal firearms trader and were unable to turn up the weapon \u2013 or even suggest what kind of weapon it was, with any plausibility.<br> Based purely on the ammunition, and the fact that the bullet bore no rifling marks, the police announced that a modified automatic, or reactivated inert automatic, drilled through, must have fired the round. Yet the case carried no extractor marks \u2013 the indentations, fairly distinctive for each type of gun, left on the case by the ejector mechanism of an automatic pistol or rifle. That means that it hadn't been ejected, which means it was not fired from an automatic pistol, which means the weapon used cannot have been of the type claimed by police. Rather, this was a custom device, possibly handmade. And this weapon, the police theory had it, would have been built by a man with no access to the necessary machinery, no history of engineering at all, who couldn't even drive and apparently has trouble doing up his buttons. There are two kinds of weapon that could have fired the shot that killed Jill Dando \u2013 both specialist devices, neither of them ever mentioned by the police. The first, a zip gun, is the most basic firearm in current use. A street gang or prison weapon, it's essentially two tubes sliding over each other, with a nail or steel rod welded to the base of one, to strike a cartridge held in place at the bottom of the other. Sometimes spring-loaded and sometimes purely manual, it's a clumsy and awkward weapon, and most street-built examples can only be operated with two hands. Witnesses described a tall man dressed in dark clothing, perhaps a black suit, carrying a large mobile phone. He, or someone very like him, was placed outside Dando's home, in her street, walking away from her garden immediately after the shooting, along with several other men and the famous blue Range Rover that was once a key target for the police investigation, and was then rapidly forgotten when it didn't fit their theory. He was carrying a large mobile phone. A gun, the police said \u2013 the witnesses must have been mistaken. But what if the witnesses weren't half-blind simpletons the police suggest? What if they saw exactly what they said they saw? What if they saw a man holding <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1m7I6MduFg\">this</a>?<br> Covert handguns disguised as mobile phones, generally firing a .22 or 9mm round, have been found all over Europe \u2013 but they all appear to be manufactured in the same place, the former Yugoslavia. You can tell where I'm going with this can't you? The police theory \u2013 the \"rational\" theory \u2013 suggests a man with an IQ of 75 carried out such a killing, alone, and perfectly. It simply isn't credible, and it never was. The only credible theory is a that of a professional assassination, carried out on behalf of either a criminal organisation, angered by Dando's work on Crimewatch, or perhaps on behalf of someone else.</p> <p>This is the conspiracy theory \u2013 and yet it is the simplest option. The only question is who ordered the hit? People point to Crimewatch, but like the rest of the British media, they don't really \"do\" organised crime. Did Crimewach ever take down a gangland boss? And is it credible to suggest some poor bugger swindling widows out of their savings took revenge from his prison cell? I don't think so. So we turn to the other option.<br> Chances are every state has people to deal with individuals they want removed. We don't know if our own country does, but with some nations, we know they have assassinated people in the recent past. Countries like, well, Serbia for instance. Add the fact that callers to the BBC after the killing claimed it on behalf of Serbia, that presenters such as John Humphrys were also threatened because of their perceived support for the Kosovan cause, and the Serbian connection must look credible. So why did the police focus on Barry George?  Who knows. But I can guess. The Serbian theory posits revenge as the motive. Revenge for Clinton and Blair's illegal Kosovo war, but specifically for the war crime <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/EUR70/018/2000/en/dom-EUR700182000en.html\">perpetrated</a> by British and US forces in the early hours of April 23 1999, when Nato missiles smashed into the headquarters of Radio and Television Serbia <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/326653.stm \">killing</a> 16 broadcasting staff.<br> We bombed their state broadcaster \u2013 claiming it was a legitimate target as it propagandised for their side \u2013 and they struck back, so the theory goes. The BBC had presented hours of footage backing wholeheartedly the Nato line that Milosevic was a new Hitler, that \"humanitarian intervention\" was essential. Dando, no doubt in good faith, broadcast an appeal on behalf of the Kosovan refugees. That's more than enough motive. More of a motive than police ever suggested for Barry George. But not really a motive anyone in the UK establishment would want to talk up. Perhaps I'm being cynical \u2013 maybe the original police investigation really did think that the Serb theory, even though it fitted the facts, was not credible. But why might that be? Because it was a conspiracy theory? When even positing a conspiracy is enough to bring ridicule, might they actually have jettisoned the idea because of embarrassment? While it makes sense, as Charlie Brooker suggests, to try to remain close to planet Earth at all times, and not to drift too wildly on the seas of invention, it also makes sense to evaluate fairly all possibilities, especially those that fit the known facts, regardless of how fantastic those possibilities then become.</p> <p>As the greatest detective of them all once said:</p> <blockquote> <p>When you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains \u2013 however improbable \u2013 must be the truth.</p> </blockquote> <p>Barry George was finally found not guilty of the murder of Jill Dando last week, but the police should have known, nine years ago, that the idea that this man could commit such a breathtaking crime was simply that: impossible.</p>",
  "<p>Much has been made of WiiFit, Dance Dance Revolution and My Health Coach as the future of fitness. These active gaming-style applications are challenging perceptions of gaming as a sedentary, unhealthy occupation. </p> <p>But although these apps can make fitness more enjoyable \u2013 particularly if you're the kind of geek who gets pleasure simply from using technology \u2013 they can't really provide motivation. I predict that a year from now there'll be a lot of disused WiiFit benches languishing at the back of cupboards after the initial enthusiasm has worn off, providing hi-tech companions to the ab rollers and sets of weights.</p> <p>I suspect that to achieve the kind of lasting behavioural change all our doctors would like us to make, we actually don't need technology that makes the business of working out more game-like. After all, no matter how you dress it up, many people just don't like getting hot, sweaty and out of breath. Instead of using game hardware to work out, we should be using game-based motivational techniques.</p> <p>An example of this sort of system is the rather elegant PruHealth insurance scheme. If you take out health insurance with Prudential, you have the option of joining a gym at a preferential rate. Pretty straightforward stuff. But, crucially, it gets cheaper the more you use the gym. At certain gyms, if you go an average of twice a week over a three-month period, your gym membership is free.</p> <p>This system has a lot of the same mechanics as gameplay. There's a levelling-up system: going from being an \"infrequent\" gymgoer, through being an \"occasional\" one, and then to a \"regular\" gym user. Members can check their level online at any time, and there's a certain satisfaction in seeing it roll over. </p> <p>And of course there are rewards. It might not be the same thrill as scoring the Twin Blades of Azzinoth in World of Warcraft, but a monthly reduction of your gym fee from \u00a340 to \u00a315 is still pretty good motivation, and it comes with subtle bragging rights. Imagine the smug satisfaction, in a conversation about how expensive gym memberships are, of dropping the fact that you get yours for free because you go regularly.</p> <p>PruHealth's own figures suggest that this system is having an effect: 75% of those who have taken out gym membership via the insurer go at least once a week. Compare this with the 64% of Japanese WiiFit users who \u2013 according to an IT Media poll \u2013 have now stopped using it altogether. </p> <p>In my experience, the PruHealth motivation has been surprisingly strong. It's not so much the money \u2013 although, cumulatively, the reward for regular gym attendance is over \u00a3500 a year. The real success has been knowing how annoyed I'd feel at seeing the higher amount in my bank statement if I missed that critical level-up. Recently, having missed a few visits to the gym because I was away, I had to make up my sessions before the end of the month and found that I was going to the gym six times a week, a personal first.</p> <p>Unfortunately, PruHealth is now changing this system to one that's far less simple: a points-based structure in which gym fees are based on points gathered from activities including buying fresh fruit and vegetables from Sainsbury's, getting a flu jab and being a non-smoker. This complexity appeals to the role-playing geek in me, but I fear it might put many people off. </p> <p>\u00b7 <em>Naomi Alderman is a novelist and games writer</em></p>",
  "<p>Despite significant pressure from the United States, Britain, France and Germany, in the six months since it declared independence Kosovo has been recognised by just 43 of the 192 members of the United Nations. While this tally includes many of the world's most influential states \u2013 including 20 of the 27 members of the European Union, and other leading western states such as Canada and Australia \u2013 support from elsewhere has been marginal. Kosovo has been recognised by just six states from south and central America and Africa. Asian endorsements stand at Japan, South Korea, Afghanistan and a couple of Pacific microstates. </p> <p>This low count reflects a deep sense of concern over Kosovo's legal right to independence. While those states that have recognised it argue that Kosovo represents a unique case in international politics, most countries evidently continue to harbour real doubts about recognising a move that has not been accepted by Serbia (the state on whose territory Kosovo has been created), or endorsed by the UN security council.<br> It is against this backdrop that Serbia is now preparing to launch its most significant and controversial diplomatic initiative to date. Boris Tadic, the Serbian president, has just <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/bondsNews/idUSFIL35845520080803\">confirmed</a> that next month Belgrade intends to seek the UN general assembly's support for an advisory opinion from the international court of justice on <a href=\"http://www.chathamhouse.org.uk/files/11547_il220408.pdf\">the legality of independence</a> and on its recognition. To succeed, it needs 96 votes. This is not an impossible target. Already it appears to have the support of many leading non-western states, such as Russia, China, India, South Africa, Indonesia and Brazil. Meanwhile, faced with pressure from both sides, many other countries would simply welcome impartial guidance on the matter. <br> Although any opinion would be non-binding, if the court were to rule in Serbia's favour - and many believe that there is a good chance that it would - it would mark a severe setback for further efforts to legitimise Kosovo's statehood. While some countries, such as the United States, might just hold their ground on recognition regardless of the court's opinion, many others would come under real pressure, domestically and internationally, to rescind their decision. In the meantime, it seems unlikely that Kosovo would receive any further recognition. Under these circumstances, Serbia is now coming under pressure to drop its plans to pursue the case. Already, Washington has warned against such a move. So too have leading members of the EU. A few weeks ago, Bernard Kouchner, the French foreign minister, <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;rls=GWYA,GWYA:2005-37,GWYA:en&amp;q=ICJ+Kosovo+Kouchner\">called on Serbia</a> to drop its plans. More recently, the British ambassador in Belgrade also <a href=\"http://www.b92.net/eng/news/politics-article.php?yyyy=2008&amp;mm=08&amp;dd=03&amp;nav_id=52409\">urged</a> the Serbian government to reconsider its plan. Calling the move a \"mistake\", he argued that it represented a \"direct challenge to the EU\" and suggested that it would make cooperation between the EU and Serbia more difficult. Privately, some EU officials have <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/displayStory.cfm?story_id=11585306\">indicated</a> that it could even damage Serbia's EU accession prospects.<br> However, EU members must avoid being seen to strong-arm Serbia into backing down on this issue. Such moves will only reflect badly on the EU as a whole. For a start, and most obviously, by trying to stop Serbia from going to the ICJ it rather suggests that many states maintain real doubts over the legality of their decision to recognise Kosovo. Second, having taking an uncompromising stand on Serbia's full cooperation with the ICTY as a precondition for membership, it would not look good for EU members to demand that their own actions be exempt from legal scrutiny on the grounds of political expediency.</p> <p>But there are bigger issues at stake. After insisting that the states of the Balkans must not resort to armed force in managing their disputes, and having explicitly warned Serbia not to do so in the case of Kosovo, it is illogical, if not fundamentally wrong, now to try to close off the most peaceful and legitimate methods of conflict resolution. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, at a time when EU members are emphasising the importance of international law in global politics, and are seeking to strengthen the institutions of international justice, it sends out the message that they are unwilling to subject they own actions to legal oversight.</p> <p>It is understandable why those countries that have supported independence are worried by the prospect of an ICJ hearing on the matter. However, by pressuring Serbia to drop its plan, they only serve to entrench doubts about the legitimacy of Kosovo's declaration of independence, and, in the case of EU members, undermine the European Union's wider foreign policy goals in the Balkans and beyond.</p>",
